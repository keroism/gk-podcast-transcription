00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,868
Rym: It's Thursday, February 24th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:11,089
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:13,557
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,538
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight Unions.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,778
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:37,420
Rym: So a problem in New York that people probably don't run into that often unless they live here is that there are jackasses who will try to like hold the subway door open if they didn't make a train.

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,660
Scott: Or if they're waiting for someone.

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,160
Scott: Well, they do the same thing on the elevator, right?

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,819
Scott: It's like you got an elevator, right?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,300
Scott: And somebody's running to the elevator and someone in the elevator will hold the elevator.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,760
Scott: Now, sometimes in a building where the elevator suck, that's a good strategy.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,000
Scott: But in some buildings, it's a bad strategy for overall elevator speed.

13
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:57,940
Rym: Yeah, but the subway, it's the worst because it gets in the way like it messes up the whole system because the train's late for nothing.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,680
Scott: If you hold the subway for 10 seconds for one guy, so he sneaks in, you know, the train is delayed.

15
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:10,260
Scott: Now it's going to close the doors and it takes 20 seconds, but 20 seconds times a thousand people.

16
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:14,460
Scott: It's like it could be an hours of time that you have just wasted.

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,840
Scott: Because you waited for one guy.

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,700
Rym: In New York is that they appear to be able to ticket people who do this, so they don't do that often.

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,139
Scott: I've never seen that happen.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:34,039
Rym: But the conductors will usually, because there's no cops like on the platform, they'll do things like if someone's holding it shut, they'll wait for a little bit and then they'll open the door a tiny bit and then slam it shut again to try to hurt the guy or knock him off the train and then they'll go.

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,358
Rym: But yesterday, I was coming home and I didn't make the train because, you know, fat guy blocked me on the escalator as always.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,700
Rym: Old fat guy instead of fat girl, different.

23
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:47,480
Rym: But this guy has got like two fingers in it and he's holding it.

24
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:51,460
Rym: And there's a guy on the platform who works for the MTA.

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,700
Rym: And he's the guy with the microphone who announces when trains are coming.

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,077
Rym: So he walks over and he stands behind the guy and he's like, "Brother, what are you trying to

27
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:00,258
Rym: do?".

28
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:03,398
Rym: And the guy ignores him and he's like, "Here, let me

29
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:03,579
Rym: help.".

30
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:06,680
Rym: And he reaches in behind him like he's going to help him like pull the door open.

31
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:11,044
Rym: And then he grabs the guy's hands, whips him out of the train and pulls him back and says, "You jackass.

32
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:12,492
Rym: The fuck are you doing?

33
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:13,517
Rym: Get the fuck out of

34
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:13,818
Rym: here.".

35
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:18,200
Rym: And the guy turns around like he's going to do something, but then he slinks off.

36
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,190
Scott: You can't do anything.

37
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:19,940
Scott: He's an MTA employee.

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,119
Scott: If you touch him, you'll be in jail for seven years.

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,099
Rym: That's like hitting a cop.

40
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:25,832
Scott: It's like you're done.

41
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:26,978
Scott: You can't touch MTA employees.

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,180
Rym: I love how he actually faked that he was going to help the guy just in order to chastise him further.

43
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:35,400
Scott: Yeah, that's a quality MTA employee.

44
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:46,100
Scott: Imagine if anyone who touched you, immediate seven years in jail, and there's almost a guarantee that they're going to lose in court because there's laws.

45
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,913
Scott: You would totally just be like, "Well, whatever.

46
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:50,777
Scott: No one's fucking with

47
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:50,998
Scott: me.".

48
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:57,040
Scott: Even if you were a weak-ass midget or a big, fat, you know, a schlub who had no physical ability whatsoever.

49
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,591
Scott: You'd be like, "No one's messing with me.

50
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,336
Scott: Not while I'm on the

51
00:02:59,356 --> 00:02:59,699
Scott: job.".

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,920
Rym: There's a problem there because if you take someone off and off, they'll just get you when you're not on the job.

53
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,554
Scott: That's a problem.

54
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,206
Rym: I generally have a policy of.

55
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:11,039
Rym: I will not entangle my affairs with anyone who has little to lose.

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,720
Scott: No, me either, but I'm just saying, if you're an MTA guy, right, you know, that's a good move.

57
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,260
Scott: Yeah, I was on the train just now, and it was stuck underground for like a half hour.

58
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:24,387
Scott: It was the worst.

59
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:25,736
Scott: It sucked.

60
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:26,320
Scott: Anyway.

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,089
Rym: Yeah, so I don't have much.

62
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,840
Rym: It's Thursday, kind of a quiet week.

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,289
Rym: We're getting ready for convention season.

64
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:33,100
Rym: Very soon we'll be at PAX and all those other things.

65
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:36,594
Rym: I want to briefly talk about not the fact that Borders is closing.

66
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:37,097
Rym: We all know.

67
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:37,780
Rym: No one cares.

68
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:41,060
Rym: I actually recommend don't even bother going to one of the closeouts.

69
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:44,660
Rym: Nothing good is going to be left, and the prices won't be better than Amazon.

70
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:52,879
Scott: Usually, the way these closeout things work is, number one, if you're in a crowded place like New York City, there's enough people that are going to rate it, and there won't be anything good left.

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,660
Scott: Two, they start out with like 20% off, and then they go down to like 25.

72
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,317
Rym: Yeah, when Media Play went out of business in RIT, we went to the Media Play when they had the real sales, like 80-90% off.

73
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:07,200
Rym: It was 90% off things I wouldn't take for free.

74
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:10,092
Scott: Yeah, they know what's valuable and what's not, right?

75
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:13,628
Scott: So the good stuff gets the little discounts, and the bad stuff gets huge discounts.

76
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:18,550
Scott: So it's like you either don't want it, like I won't even take that for a dollar, or it's like I'd buy that for a dollar.

77
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,414
Scott: Well, it's 10 bucks.

78
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:19,896
Scott: Well, fuck it.

79
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:20,720
Scott: I'm not buying it, right?

80
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:29,620
Scott: So if you wait to the very, very end of the bargains before they finally close the store, there's basically nothing left.

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,980
Scott: I only recommend going if you're interested in buying the store's fixtures, because that is always a good deal.

82
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,058
Scott: It's like bookshelves, 50 bucks, probably cheaper than IKEA.

83
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:42,740
Rym: Or possibly crappy coffee table books and references.

84
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,279
Scott: But you can get stuff like the chairs and tables out of the cafÃ©.

85
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:49,175
Scott: You might even be able to get, like, who knows?

86
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:50,000
Scott: I haven't been to one.

87
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,080
Scott: They might be selling off the espresso machines or the cash registers.

88
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:57,909
Scott: They sell in everything, right?

89
00:04:57,929 --> 00:05:00,560
Scott: Well, I guess they have to keep at least one cash register at the very end.

90
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:04,839
Rym: So if the last guy who buys the cash register just takes it.

91
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,670
Rym: You could go with it.

92
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:09,220
Scott: It is actually not a bad idea.

93
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,920
Scott: If you're an armed robber or unarmed robber, go hit up a Borders, because they'd probably be having a lot of cash there.

94
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:17,488
Rym: Yeah, they'll have a lot of cash there.

95
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,479
Rym: No, they probably won't.

96
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,497
Scott: Well, if there's increased sales because of the, you know, whatever.

97
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,160
Rym: The only thing you got going for yourself if you rob a place that's going out of business is that nobody gives a shit.

98
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:30,779
Rym: No one's going to fight to protect that merchandise.

99
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:34,260
Scott: No, not the merchandise, but they'll fight to protect the money and the rest.

100
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:34,744
Scott: No, they won't.

101
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:37,855
Rym: If you're getting paid minimum wage, knowing that it's- No, but the police won't.

102
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,080
Rym: Yeah, because the police are hanging out in the Borders.

103
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,680
Scott: Anyway.

104
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:48,280
Rym: Anyway, this article talks more about the idea that what's going to happen to all the Borders stores, because Borders stores are huge.

105
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:55,700
Rym: And I think this article is way optimistic as to the prospects for the use of these stores.

106
00:05:56,061 --> 00:06:04,200
Rym: Because it's talking a lot about how, yeah, they'll be able to turn them over and maybe other bookstores will come in or churches or local, you know, like, gyms and whatever.

107
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,360
Scott: But I could see some gyms and some churches.

108
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:12,040
Rym: I did some research and there are still a surprising number of media plays that are still empty.

109
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:19,360
Rym: There isn't a demand for stores this big anymore because all the places that need stores that big already have all the locations they need.

110
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,100
Rym: They're not expanding because the economy sucks.

111
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,700
Scott: That's one of the major reasons that Borders went under is because Borders originally differed from Barnes and Noble in that it had the big music section.

112
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,760
Scott: And then no one bought, you know, media play also.

113
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,860
Scott: And then since when they got rid of the music section, because no one bought music anymore, they had all this extra space.

114
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,140
Scott: So every Borders is paying extra rent for extra space that it didn't need.

115
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,694
Scott: And they filled that extra space with books.

116
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:41,319
Scott: it didn't sell.

117
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,119
Rym: Well, the thing is, it's a weird cafe.

118
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:44,679
Rym: It's not really an extra cost.

119
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,899
Rym: The stores were big because they had a bunch of stuff in them.

120
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:49,100
Rym: But there was no opportunity cost.

121
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,579
Rym: Nothing else could have gone there.

122
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:51,237
Scott: Yeah.

123
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,811
Scott: But it still meant you were paying more rent for more space.

124
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,580
Scott: And every square foot costs you money.

125
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,920
Scott: If the Borders stores had been smaller originally and not had a music section, they might still be here today.

126
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,299
Rym: But at the same time, part of their thing was that they were in these big boxes.

127
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,799
Scott: Yeah, they had other problems.

128
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,980
Rym: I mean, Borders and Barnes and Noble stores like this are primarily designed to be in a very large monolithic location separate from other things.

129
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:16,979
Rym: Or at the best, in a shopping plaza.

130
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:25,140
Rym: And, I don't know, I feel like if we extrapolate, if we do a Y+30, there is very little cause for stores like this.

131
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,200
Rym: The very, very large magnet specialty stores that have branches everywhere.

132
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:31,980
Rym: And considering how many media plays are still empty.

133
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,880
Scott: These kinds of stores haven't even been around for that long.

134
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:40,340
Scott: Even when I was young, places like Kaldor or whatever were kind of rare.

135
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,900
Rym: Well, you lived in a very different area.

136
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:48,240
Rym: I lived in the Midwest where basically every street that had commerce on it was stores like Barnes and Noble and Borders.

137
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,758
Rym: Just as far as the eye can see.

138
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,995
Scott: These kinds of stores weren't around in the 70s and the 80s.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,180
Scott: They just started to appear.

140
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,319
Rym: Oh, it depends on where you live.

141
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,120
Scott: Sears is pretty much it, right?

142
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,248
Rym: Yeah, it's a department store.

143
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:01,940
Rym: Usually those anchor malls and things.

144
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:08,740
Rym: But, remember a while ago I did an article talking about how malls are having a lot of trouble getting people to be in them.

145
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:20,080
Rym: So, I'm thinking we're going to have, in the next 15 or so years, a gigantic surplus of very large, very nice, empty big box stores and malls.

146
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Scott: Well, a lot of them are just going to be condemned or whatever.

147
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,259
Rym: Yeah, but what's going to go in their place?

148
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:26,227
Scott: Hopefully nerds will use them.

149
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:29,480
Scott: If they can lower the rent enough, we could do awesome shit in that space.

150
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:37,059
Rym: If I were you, punk kids, it won't work in cities because you could knock down any store and replace it with something that costs twice as much overnight.

151
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,820
Rym: But, out in the suburbs, stores like this aren't going to refill and malls are going to be empty.

152
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,800
Scott: Well, you might start to see an entire strip mall go down and be replaced with housing.

153
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,595
Scott: You might see a big box store get an office in it.

154
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,120
Scott: Someone renovates the inside.

155
00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:02,440
Rym: Scott, when strip malls disappear and get replaced by housing, that basically destroys the local area because you start to shift toward a purely residential area with no commerce to prop it up.

156
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:03,200
Scott: Yeah.

157
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:03,800
Rym: At all.

158
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:16,960
Scott: You might see some other stuff go in there, but hopefully you're going to see cool things go in there like someone will make an auditorium or someone will make a community center or someone will move their town hall into one if their town hall or a police station.

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:35,820
Rym: There's a societal problem in general out in the burbs of what's going to happen to malls and big box stores because the biggest signs of urban or rural plight is when things like churches move into what was commercial space or commercial space, especially on commercial streets like a main street, turn into residential.

160
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,240
Rym: I mean, remember Beacon, the big problem they had was that as the economy shut down, all the storefronts turned into apartments.

161
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:48,700
Rym: They passed a law saying that all the apartments had to turn back into storefronts as part of the rejuvenation of the city.

162
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:50,062
Rym: I don't know.

163
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:55,119
Rym: I feel like there's going to be a boom of paintball and crazy nerdy shit because- That's what I hope.

164
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,561
Rym: I think it will.

165
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:10,340
Rym: My reasoning for this is that the entrepreneurial spirit, if you discount the dot com kind of bullshit, exists primarily in my eyes just as a kind of uninvolved person in that whole area of the world or area of commerce.

166
00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:16,780
Rym: It's people who are making restaurants and nerds who just want to do something cool like make my gaming store.

167
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,720
Rym: And if rents go way down, the only thing keeping nerds from doing that is the fact that rent is too high.

168
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:35,620
Scott: Or at least, you know, if something bigger moves from, say, you got something that's in a small store now or a medium store now and it moves into the big store, then the nerdy thing can move into the small store that was just evacuated.

169
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,065
Rym: I mean, it wouldn't work in New York City.

170
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:38,290
Rym: I mean, the complete strat.

171
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,080
Rym: It'd be great if they could move into borders, but they couldn't afford that ever.

172
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:47,080
Rym: But out like in Poughkeepsie, the Dragon's Den, if they got a place the size of a border, they could turn into a millennium.

173
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:47,840
Scott: Probably.

174
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,980
Rym: Probably overnight almost.

175
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:49,460
Rym: Maybe.

176
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,480
Scott: Just have magic tournaments.

177
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,795
Scott: They don't have enough merchandise.

178
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,306
Rym: You don't need merchandise.

179
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:54,132
Rym: You have space.

180
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:55,260
Rym: You use the space for something.

181
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:56,003
Scott: Yeah.

182
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:57,600
Scott: They're not- I don't know how creative they are.

183
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,061
Rym: Yeah.

184
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:04,291
Rym: What I do find interesting, as a kind of random aside, this article on Tampa Bay Online at the bottom has comments.

185
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:08,719
Rym: Almost all the comments are, "This comment was removed by site

186
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,140
Rym: staff.".

187
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:11,392
Scott: Why don't they just remove the comment completely?

188
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:12,580
Scott: Why did they leave the words there?

189
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,620
Rym: Why does any newspaper in the world have a comment section?

190
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:17,720
Scott: Just use discuss.

191
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,338
Scott: Anyway.

192
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,925
Scott: So I want to talk a little bit about it.

193
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:26,720
Scott: It's sorting news because they're currently battling the crazy Baptist church, right?

194
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:27,376
Scott: Oh, anonymous?

195
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:27,881
Scott: Yeah.

196
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:30,680
Scott: I'll talk about some anonymous because you haven't talked about them on the show in a long time.

197
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,641
Scott: The main thing I want to talk about, though, is- Yeah.

198
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,140
Rym: Because there's a lot to talk about with anonymous.

199
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,860
Scott: The mainstream media's complete inability to understand what anonymous is.

200
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:41,231
Rym: Wow.

201
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,675
Scott: It's like they just can't sort of ... They talk about it like, "So is this an official anonymous

202
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:48,016
Scott: thing?".

203
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:49,520
Scott: Or anonymous said that.

204
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:50,640
Scott: Anonymous didn't say that.

205
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,082
Scott: You know what?

206
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:52,085
Rym: You know what the answer is?

207
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:52,688
Rym: Yes.

208
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,100
Rym: Anything that claims to be anonymous is officially anonymous.

209
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,481
Scott: Yeah.

210
00:11:56,922 --> 00:12:00,553
Scott: And also, no, nothing that anyone says is anonymous.

211
00:12:00,614 --> 00:12:12,769
Scott: They're both through ... It's like they can't ... These people can't seem to grasp the idea that there is an entity that is not official, does not have a set structure, does not have a head person, does not have any people with it.

212
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:15,138
Scott: It's just a label that anybody can use.

213
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:15,580
Scott: this label.

214
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,237
Scott: It is a free ... I could come out and I could say, "This episode of GeekNights is brought to you by

215
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:19,680
Scott: anonymous.".

216
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,144
Scott: And you know what?

217
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:21,720
Scott: That means it is, but it also means it's not.

218
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,178
Rym: Well, because I am a member of anonymous straight up.

219
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:25,579
Scott: Yeah, everybody is.

220
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,457
Rym: Even if I've never posted on 4chan.

221
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,488
Scott: It's like, how can you not comprehend this?

222
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:30,916
Scott: Did you not watch Ghost in the Shell?

223
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:33,940
Rym: Did you not- I have a feeling they have not watched Ghost in the Shell.

224
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,058
Scott: Have they not watched Durara?

225
00:12:36,044 --> 00:12:37,000
Rym: I'm getting that impression.

226
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,779
Scott: Maybe they should watch those things.

227
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:49,414
Rym: What I find really cool is that in my daily conversations, whenever anonymous or the internet or society come up, I can use terms like second order simulacra that I learned from Ghost in the Shell.

228
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:50,900
Rym: totally legit.

229
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:53,960
Scott: That makes my life a little bit cooler.

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,319
Scott: It's like, how can they don't ... They just don't get it.

231
00:12:56,862 --> 00:12:59,160
Scott: It's like, there's no official organization.

232
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,760
Scott: There's a bunch of people, some of whom are like-minded and some of whom are not.

233
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,440
Rym: Scott, it is a very alien idea to people who didn't grow up with the internet.

234
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,620
Scott: They all communicate through the same sort of medium, so they get to see a lot of what each other are thinking.

235
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:13,200
Scott: So they're sharing parts of their brain with each other.

236
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,640
Scott: And when there is sort of a convergence of ways that will resonate, an activity will occur.

237
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,420
Rym: Scott, it's really easy to understand why they don't understand it.

238
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,240
Rym: Let's use an example of DictoChat, all right?

239
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,220
Rym: What is DictoChat during like- You mean PictoChat on the DS?

240
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:28,199
Rym: I mean DictoChat.

241
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,260
Scott: What the hell is DictoChat?

242
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:32,180
Rym: What do people type in PictoChat?

243
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:33,202
Scott: Oh, okay.

244
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:34,030
Scott: Whatever.

245
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:45,460
Rym: So if we're doing, say, a panel, right, at a convention, or everyone's in the audience watching, say, an event at a convention, and everyone who's there has their DS out and they're talking in PictoChat.

246
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,680
Scott: And the Wi-Fi doesn't just crumble?

247
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:48,820
Rym: They're having a sideband communication.

248
00:13:49,040 --> 00:14:00,620
Rym: They're having this kind of separate meeting or separate entity that exists, concurrent to and in, and kind of responding to an event or a community, but yet is wholly separate from it.

249
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,580
Rym: And people who aren't in the DictoChat channels have no idea it even exists and cannot interact with it.

250
00:14:06,141 --> 00:14:09,820
Rym: The internet is like that for the majority of people over the age of 45.

251
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,499
Scott: Right, but here's the thing.

252
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:15,000
Scott: Plenty of times, it's not like these media people, they're not morons, right?

253
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:15,959
Scott: Who are they going to ask?

254
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:20,160
Scott: No, it's like, you know, they talk to people who obviously know what's going on.

255
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:20,943
Rym: Who?

256
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:21,609
Rym: When?

257
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,436
Rym: No, they don't.

258
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:22,900
Scott: Ever.

259
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,634
Scott: Yeah, they do.

260
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,097
Scott: Who have they talked to?

261
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,960
Scott: Because there's, go look through the recent news, right?

262
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,400
Scott: Even, like, especially with the Westboro church, you know, fighting, right?

263
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:40,620
Scott: There are plenty of people who, quote, "represent anonymous," but basically it's just some guys, you know, or one guy or another talks to the media in some form or another.

264
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,580
Scott: Yes, but the- And those people, while, you know, who knows who they are, they're anonymous, but they're clearly people who know what's up because, you know, you can tell just from the way they're talking.

265
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,049
Rym: And I know to you that those people do not- They're like, "You mad?

266
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,293
Scott: What's

267
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:51,517
Scott: up?".

268
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,280
Rym: But Scott, I know to you those people don't explain what the deal is to the real people.

269
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,319
Scott: They do, but those real people still don't seem to get it.

270
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,340
Rym: Because it doesn't make sense to someone who didn't grow up with the internet.

271
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,800
Scott: And there's also more lulls if they don't understand, which is a problem.

272
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:18,180
Rym: I mean, they don't understand that pretty much every single person who has access to technology, who is between the ages of 8 and 28, in the entire world, it has a collective consciousness that is constantly communicating.

273
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,603
Rym: They don't realize that.

274
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:25,640
Rym: They have no idea that you and me have more in common with punk kids in Libya and Iran than we do with our neighbors.

275
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:30,960
Rym: That, in fact, we communicate with people around the world more than we communicate with the people behind these walls.

276
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,525
Rym: They have no idea.

277
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:33,932
Rym: That is so crazy to them.

278
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:35,440
Rym: It's a zebra storyteller.

279
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:39,540
Scott: But we told them the zebra story like a hundred times.

280
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:40,586
Rym: No, we didn't actually.

281
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,114
Rym: Do you think they actually listen?

282
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:43,080
Rym: That's the other problem.

283
00:15:44,040 --> 00:16:02,699
Rym: I mean, if I sat down, one of these reporters, and I was like, look, and I made them watch Ghost in the Shell, and I explained Second Order Simulacra and First Order Simulacra and resonances and how all these people are kind of resonating and acting together as one, because they all individually came to the same conclusion, but there was no person who actually instigated it.

284
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:04,186
Rym: They're gone.

285
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:04,833
Rym: They have no idea.

286
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:05,560
Rym: That won't happen.

287
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:07,884
Rym: There's no way.

288
00:16:07,944 --> 00:16:08,265
Rym: Give up.

289
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:09,750
Rym: In fact, don't give up.

290
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:11,718
Scott: We are wizards.

291
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,580
Scott: The other reason I wanted to talk about this is because I have a partial solution, right?

292
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,820
Scott: I think that what we need to do is we need to make some sort of anonymous news network.

293
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:26,284
Scott: Scott, we already did.

294
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:26,525
Rym: Ignites.

295
00:16:29,482 --> 00:16:31,529
Scott: No, but we should present it as a real newspaper.

296
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,420
Scott: The website should look like a real newspaper's website, and it should have articles.

297
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:40,985
Rym: I would do it a different way.

298
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:41,728
Rym: You know what I would do?

299
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:55,339
Rym: I would make it a network that has reporters, and basically someone just has to anonymously post YouTube videos that are just like news with anchors, but they're wearing the stupid V mask, and they just report on things.

300
00:16:55,963 --> 00:17:01,135
Rym: Once one person does it, someone else will start doing it, and then there's no way to say who the official people are.

301
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:01,779
Rym: It just happens.

302
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:04,731
Scott: I think that that would provide news.

303
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,240
Rym: No, it would provide hilarity.

304
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,275
Scott: But also news from people who understood what was going on.

305
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:25,290
Scott: Once in a while, someone would give a serious news report, and the news report wouldn't be by someone who doesn't understand anything in the world that is newer than the year 2000.

306
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:25,955
Rym: So let's do it.

307
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,779
Scott: All right, sure.

308
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,368
Rym: We've got a video camera.

309
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:31,480
Rym: I've got to buy a couple of V masks.

310
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,738
Scott: Gee, people don't know who it is.

311
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:39,318
Scott: We'll be really anonymous with those.

312
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,770
Rym: But things of the day.

313
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,560
Rym: I really like this.

314
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:57,440
Rym: It's just a stop-motion animation beatbox song where every note is the name for an animal.

315
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,499
Rym: Like cow, baboon, cow, baboon, baboon.

316
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,484
Rym: I don't know.

317
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:03,152
Rym: What else can I say?

318
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:03,638
Rym: It's really cool.

319
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:04,946
Scott: Baboon?

320
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:05,759
Scott: It's baboon.

321
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,359
Rym: Yeah, but he says it like baboon.

322
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:08,660
Scott: It's cheating.

323
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,739
Rym: Yeah, kind of like how horses horse.

324
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:11,740
Scott: That's cheating.

325
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:12,617
Scott: Horse.

326
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:13,640
Scott: That's also cheating.

327
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,218
Scott: Be horse.

328
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:16,436
Rym: Cheval.

329
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:19,547
Scott: I don't know.

330
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:20,900
Scott: This might have been thing of the day already.

331
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:22,666
Scott: It's been all over the internet.

332
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:23,350
Scott: It's pretty old.

333
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,240
Scott: It's weeks, if not months old.

334
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,979
Rym: What, My Little Pony?

335
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:26,697
Scott: No.

336
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:32,022
Scott: My Little Pony is from fall of 2010.

337
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:32,769
Scott: It's just an image.

338
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:33,900
Scott: It's a simple JPEG.

339
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,839
Scott: But it is a hilarious JPEG if you have not yet seen it.

340
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:41,918
Scott: Judging by how many people on the internet post things that are old and I say, "Oh my God, that's 10 years

341
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:42,159
Scott: old.".

342
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,280
Scott: The fact that this is less than 10 years old, I'm sure there are listeners that have not seen it yet.

343
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,860
Scott: So I'm going to use it for thing of the day anyway.

344
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:49,920
Rym: It harkens back to a simpler time.

345
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,220
Scott: Yes, it's a JPEG and the JPEG says Wolverine or to Batman.

346
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,639
Scott: And once you see it, that's all you need to do.

347
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,468
Scott: It's a JPEG.

348
00:18:58,488 --> 00:18:59,240
Scott: It'll take you five seconds.

349
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,940
Rym: And of course, before the main topic, we have to do the meta moment.

350
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,880
Rym: Because we will be at the Penny Arcade Expo in Boston coming up, what, three weeks?

351
00:19:09,944 --> 00:19:10,578
Scott: Too soon.

352
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:11,585
Rym: Oh my God.

353
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:13,619
Rym: I just finished the panels.

354
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,391
Scott: We did not completely finish the panels.

355
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:18,039
Scott: They require buffing.

356
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,500
Rym: But we are doing five panels in three panel slots.

357
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:23,492
Scott: Three hours, five panels.

358
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:24,540
Scott: We're just that crazy.

359
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:28,200
Scott: There's also a bunch of panels by other peoples that we know.

360
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:31,200
Rym: Luke Crane, Jared Sorensen, et cetera.

361
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,979
Scott: Lots of people.

362
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:37,200
Rym: And otherwise, the weekend right after that, we're going to be at Zenkai Con doing a bunch of gaming panels.

363
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,499
Rym: And I think one anime panel.

364
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,260
Scott: Alrighty.

365
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,280
Rym: And we are going to be at Anime Boston doing at least four panels.

366
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:44,873
Scott: Nice nap.

367
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:46,840
Rym: We'll get the details for you later.

368
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,780
Rym: But yes, if you are a regular of Anime Boston, we will be there.

369
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,760
Scott: It's convention season.

370
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,069
Scott: Yeah.

371
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,660
Rym: I'm actually looking forward to Anime Boston.

372
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,320
Scott: I'm looking forward to all these conventions.

373
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,376
Scott: The last anime anime con.

374
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,200
Scott: I'm just not looking forward to transportation.

375
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,420
Rym: I mean, the New York Comic Con anime festival is not really an anime con anymore.

376
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,080
Rym: The last anime con I went to was Anime Boston.

377
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,900
Scott: You know, actually, we're talking about Anime Boston, which is, I think, later in April, actually.

378
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,588
Rym: Yeah, like April 21st-ish.

379
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,960
Scott: Yeah, we're already talking about Anime Boston.

380
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,697
Scott: We should also be talking about the Mocha Festival, which is on April 9th and 10th.

381
00:20:21,523 --> 00:20:22,160
Scott: Oh, crap.

382
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,060
Scott: Two weeks before Anime Boston.

383
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,719
Rym: Museum of Comic and Comedic Arts.

384
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,100
Scott: Comic and Cartoon Arts.

385
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,358
Rym: Comic and Cartoon Arts.

386
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,580
Rym: And they do a comic festival.

387
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:32,857
Rym: In New York.

388
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:33,316
Scott: Yep.

389
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:34,940
Rym: In the Armory Building.

390
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,600
Scott: And actually, that week in between the Mocha Festival and Anime Boston is ICON, which we've never gone to and probably won't go to.

391
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:41,140
Scott: Oh, great.

392
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:42,420
Rym: Sorry, ICON.

393
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:42,912
Scott: Sorry.

394
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:44,096
Rym: I think you've invited us.

395
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:45,998
Scott: No, they don't think they've invited us.

396
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:46,915
Scott: They have.

397
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:50,959
Scott: Also, let's see, we've got Book Club Book.

398
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:52,320
Scott: It's Hyperspace.

399
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,679
Rym: God hasn't read it yet.

400
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:54,599
Scott: I read a chapter.

401
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,439
Scott: I'm going to keep reading.

402
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,378
Scott: It'll probably be the next Thursday episode in two weeks from now.

403
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,720
Scott: Unless, we'll see.

404
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,900
Scott: Depends on the schedule.

405
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,357
Scott: But, yeah.

406
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,159
Scott: Hopefully, that will be the Thursday episode two Thursdays from now.

407
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,360
Rym: And, of course, we've been repeating this a lot, but it seems to be working.

408
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:17,920
Rym: We have a rocking forum, and if you like us and/or My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic, you should be hanging out in the GeekNights forum.

409
00:21:19,848 --> 00:21:20,400
Scott: One more thing.

410
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,700
Scott: I do want to, you know, I realized lately, it's strange.

411
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,480
Scott: We got a whole bunch of listener emails recently, and usually we don't get that many listener emails.

412
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:31,300
Scott: And I think that's mostly because we don't read listener emails.

413
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,259
Rym: Well, we read them.

414
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,119
Rym: We do not read them out loud on the show.

415
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:34,580
Scott: Right.

416
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,419
Scott: I think maybe we should, like, you know, maybe let's read one if we have one.

417
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:40,619
Rym: Alright, I'll tell you this.

418
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,377
Scott: And then, we'll make it incredibly quick, but then maybe that will encourage a lot more mailings.

419
00:21:46,478 --> 00:21:47,100
Scott: if we read them.

420
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,360
Rym: Next week, on Monday, we do the Monday show, we will read the best listener email we have received to date.

421
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,340
Scott: And then, so it's just geeknights@frontroomrecruit.com, and send us emails, and we're going to start reading, I guess, one on the show.

422
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,300
Scott: We'll do more Geek Back.

423
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:02,160
Scott: Ah, we'll see.

424
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:04,218
Scott: I always find the- If they don't suck.

425
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:09,520
Rym: I always find the listener email segment of any other show very tedious and tend to fast forward through it.

426
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:11,060
Scott: Yeah, but we'll see how it goes.

427
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,520
Rym: Because the emails are either a question that's very specific to one person.

428
00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:16,000
Scott: Yeah, I'm not going to read that.

429
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,811
Rym: Or they're a, "You guys are so awesome.

430
00:22:17,872 --> 00:22:18,798
Rym: Oh my God, you changed my

431
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,020
Rym: life.".

432
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,900
Scott: Or they're something they could have checked on Google.

433
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,659
Rym: So there was a time, you understand, a different time, when- Like, over a hundred years ago.

434
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,059
Rym: When the working man in the coal mine didn't get shit.

435
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:32,500
Scott: Well, he still usually doesn't get shit.

436
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,500
Scott: In many places in the world, they don't get shit.

437
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:36,080
Rym: We had a labor movement.

438
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,879
Scott: Child slaves picking chocolate in the Ivory Coast.

439
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:40,153
Rym: Yep, never mind.

440
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:40,760
Rym: Slaves.

441
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,760
Scott: Slaves, well, you know, digging for diamonds.

442
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,446
Scott: Slaves in the U.S.

443
00:22:45,446 --> 00:22:45,870
Scott: 200, 300 years ago.

444
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,278
Rym: Yep, picking cotton and such.

445
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,660
Rym: And, I don't know, unions have had it along in tumultuous history.

446
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,680
Rym: And it's interesting that technical workers, at least ITCS, you know, computery people.

447
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,320
Rym: Unions, by and large, don't exist in our industry.

448
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:02,239
Scott: No, not at all.

449
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:10,700
Rym: So, it's interesting when I'm reminded of unions, because I have a very complex opinion on their necessary-ness, I guess?

450
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:18,400
Scott: Yeah, it's strange, because, you know, it's like, most people have, you know, very simplistic political views, right?

451
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,100
Scott: They're like, they're either like, you know, I mean, there's parties, political parties out there, called, like, the Labor Party.

452
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,560
Rym: Or the Rent is Too Damn High party.

453
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,100
Scott: Right, so there's a lot of people who are just, they're like, they're anti-corporate.

454
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,716
Scott: They're like, "If a company does it, it's

455
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:31,060
Scott: bad.".

456
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:34,536
Scott: You know, or, "If, you know, if it's for the workers, it's bad.

457
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:34,938
Scott: Company's

458
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:35,180
Scott: good.".

459
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:39,120
Scott: You know, and it's like, they can't, there's no subtlety to their political opinion.

460
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,379
Rym: Now, some of my political opinions are very blunt.

461
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,878
Rym: For example, I believe that freedom of speech is the most important thing ever.

462
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:46,980
Rym: And I think that trumps all other rights.

463
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:50,000
Scott: I think that there is a right that trumps freedom of speech.

464
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,351
Rym: Yes.

465
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,060
Scott: Freedom to not just get killed.

466
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,635
Rym: Alright, so, how does it trump it?

467
00:23:54,857 --> 00:23:56,627
Scott: Because- It's life, and then liberty.

468
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:59,300
Scott: So, life comes first, and then liberty comes second.

469
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:06,240
Rym: But what I'm saying is that, when is there ever a case where you would have to give up the right to not be shot to keep the right to talk?

470
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:07,380
Scott: I'm just saying.

471
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,179
Scott: How could that happen?

472
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,780
Scott: If I had a choice between giving up the right to talk or giving up the right to breathe, I'm giving up the right to talk.

473
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,844
Rym: But, think of it this way.

474
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:17,720
Rym: Say there was some sort of, we lost the right to speech.

475
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:20,279
Rym: Would you put your life on the line to keep it?

476
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,840
Scott: Yeah, but I'm not just gonna, you know, I'm not gonna give, if I had to, you know- That's not what I was saying.

477
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:32,780
Rym: Anyway, I have a fairly, you know, there's not a lot of subtlety to the opinion that freedom of speech is number one.

478
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:34,219
Scott: Very important.

479
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,595
Rym: But yet, when it comes to unions, my opinion is not indifferent.

480
00:24:37,937 --> 00:24:38,600
Rym: It is ambivalent.

481
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,505
Rym: There's a big difference.

482
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,460
Rym: A lot of people make this mistake, even in our forum.

483
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,079
Rym: So, I guess we should get this out right now.

484
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:45,539
Rym: If you're indifferent, it means you don't give a shit.

485
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:48,556
Rym: Or you do not feel strongly at all in any direction.

486
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:56,400
Scott: Yeah, so if you're indifferent, say about, you know, the cost of pizza, then if pizza was a million dollars, you go meh.

487
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,517
Scott: And if pizza was negative dollars, they are paying you to eat pizza, you go meh.

488
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:00,080
Scott: That's indifferent.

489
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:08,720
Rym: But if you are ambivalent, it means that you are ambivalent, as in you are being pulled in multiple directions with equivalent force.

490
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:14,280
Rym: For example, on unions, I am ambivalent in that I have very strong and conflicting opinions.

491
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:16,320
Scott: Yeah, it's like- In many directions.

492
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,260
Scott: You go on the one hand, that pizza being expensive, I can see why.

493
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,780
Scott: You know, the price of dough is rising.

494
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,326
Scott: But on the other hand- But man's gotta eat some pizza.

495
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:25,754
Scott: You can't be charging that much.

496
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,720
Scott: That's just not fair.

497
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:28,950
Scott: I don't know.

498
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,220
Scott: How much should pizza cost?

499
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,180
Scott: That is how you feel about the unions.

500
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:39,580
Scott: Now, the thing is, back in the olden days, right, when unions got big in the industrial revolution times, right, they were extremely necessary.

501
00:25:39,781 --> 00:25:46,560
Scott: Because you had people who were working in conditions that were deadly, basically, right?

502
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,610
Scott: And the people who ran those deadly factories really had no reason.

503
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:53,178
Scott: They're like, "Oh, why should I make my factory less

504
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:53,579
Scott: deadly?".

505
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,301
Scott: You know?

506
00:25:54,482 --> 00:26:00,460
Scott: It's like, I'm still, you know, there's plenty of people lining up to work in my factory, so if a worker dies, I can just replace them.

507
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,512
Scott: The labor is not very highly skilled.

508
00:26:02,572 --> 00:26:03,780
Scott: I can train someone real quick.

509
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:04,101
Rym: Yup.

510
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:08,120
Rym: You also had situations like the company town where, alright, we'll give you a job and a place to live.

511
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,239
Rym: Yeah, we pay you, and you just pay your rent right back to us.

512
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Rym: And oh, there's a company store right next to your house, and oh, the prices are way higher than outside.

513
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:18,090
Rym: You can't get anywhere.

514
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,180
Rym: It's not like there's cars.

515
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:20,003
Scott: Yeah, right?

516
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:22,300
Scott: It's not like you can afford a car because they're not paying you that much.

517
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,044
Rym: Yeah.

518
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,140
Rym: And if you want to buy a car, guess who you're buying it from?

519
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,560
Scott: So basically, even though these people were not technically slaves, they perfectly were able to quit and leave.

520
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:33,620
Scott: You know, they had all these rights of freedom of speech and freedom of everything.

521
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,530
Scott: Realistically speaking, they were indentured servants.

522
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:44,260
Scott: If they wanted to get money and to eat, they were pretty much at, you know, the complete mercy of the people who own the company that they work for.

523
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,220
Rym: It's the difference between a de jure right and a de facto right.

524
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:55,500
Rym: I mean, I have the de jure right to do certain things, like to get legal counsel if I'm arrested, but the fact is, if I don't have money, I am not getting a good lawyer.

525
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,496
Scott: That's right, so...

526
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:58,305
Rym: Yeah, everything's like that.

527
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:13,100
Rym: And with labor, we had a situation where we had a free market, by and large, and the free market, the invisible hand that Republicans are so fond of, did not select for fair labor practices or labor practices that were beneficial towards society.

528
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:18,740
Rym: You could argue that the way labor was done at the turn of the century was awful and was ruining our society.

529
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,261
Scott: Yep.

530
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:29,540
Scott: So the only thing that people could do, and no one else has thought of something else, another solution yet, is to unionize, which is where you get everyone in the factory to stop working.

531
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,874
Scott: And then it's like, well, we're not your indentured servants anymore.

532
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:34,140
Scott: You have to make a deal with us.

533
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,682
Scott: And you know what?

534
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:45,379
Scott: Nobody is going to come to work in your factory unless you make it less deadly and unless you pay us more money and unless you lower the prices in the company store and unless you stop being a jerk and whipping us.

535
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:52,940
Rym: Is that there are situations like, you know, I grew up in Detroit, and it's something that most people outside of Detroit or Michigan don't know or care about.

536
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:59,140
Rym: But when I was a kid, the Detroit Free Press, all the writers and everyone involved went on strike.

537
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,530
Rym: And it was this huge deal.

538
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,200
Rym: Like, it was in the papers every day.

539
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,240
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, there's been plenty of strikes, strikes in sports, strikes in sanitation.

540
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,102
Rym: You know what happened?

541
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:13,360
Rym: They hired all scabs, and the paper just kept going without a hitch.

542
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:18,480
Rym: And the scabs were way better than everyone who would quit to strike.

543
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:18,883
Scott: Yeah.

544
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:22,132
Rym: And it was a really dicey situation all around.

545
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:22,814
Rym: It got very heated.

546
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,180
Rym: There was a lot of violence, issues.

547
00:28:25,962 --> 00:28:29,300
Rym: But you said we've only come up with one way to solve this, unions.

548
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,940
Rym: I would argue there are three kind of directions you can go in terms of labor.

549
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:41,839
Rym: One is absolute free market, not capitalism, which, as Adam Smith said very clearly, is not a completely free market by any stretch.

550
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:54,140
Rym: And that has its pros and cons, that maybe a free market, if people are truly free to choose where to work and to bargain individually, that society will converge upon optimal solutions.

551
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:06,220
Rym: Another way to look at it is that unions, that there is a free market, but people who work can collectively bargain, which, of course, can be undermined if everybody quits, but there is still a big enough labor pool to where that didn't matter.

552
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:09,406
Rym: The third way is just regulation.

553
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:14,159
Rym: A government coming in with guns and basically saying, look, you can only get away with X.

554
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,448
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that's what, you know, in the

555
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:16,809
Scott: U.S.,

556
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,217
Scott: we definitely have the third part, right?

557
00:29:18,237 --> 00:29:24,940
Scott: We have OSHA, which is, you know, I think OSHA itself has eliminated, you know, I mean, it's not perfect, but what government thing is, right?

558
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,540
Scott: But it has largely eliminated the need for many, many unions.

559
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:34,340
Rym: I'm cool with the fact that the government will get people in trouble if someone doing construction isn't given a hard hat.

560
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:35,223
Scott: Yeah, right?

561
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:40,640
Scott: It's like, you know, you don't need to make a union if you're, you know, for the problem of workplace deadliness.

562
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,148
Scott: You have things like workers' comp and such like that, right?

563
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:48,929
Scott: So you might have another reason, a valid reason to form a union, but at least that is not one of them.

564
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,617
Scott: No one is allowed to make a workplace.

565
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:51,180
Scott: that is deadly.

566
00:29:51,280 --> 00:30:03,360
Scott: So therefore, you know, nobody in the United States has to, you know, risk their lives more than necessary for their profession, you know, or take unnecessary ludicrous risks just to eat, which is good.

567
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:03,702
Rym: Yep.

568
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:06,680
Rym: But at the same time, look what's happening in Wisconsin.

569
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:15,860
Rym: I'm so, I'm not, it bothers me that I'm not amazed, nor am I surprised, but I am angry.

570
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:18,540
Rym: But I'm angry at almost everyone involved.

571
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,920
Scott: I'm just glad I don't live in Wisconsin.

572
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,460
Rym: Yeah, I'm real glad I live in New York.

573
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,228
Rym: But let's back away from all the kind of high level stuff.

574
00:30:25,248 --> 00:30:45,840
Rym: first, because as a person, as a solipsistic individual, as me and Island alone and my personal self-interest, irrespective of everyone else in the world, I have a very different opinion of unions from that perspective than I do from my "I'm actually an intelligent person who understands what it's like to be someone other than me" perspective.

575
00:30:46,560 --> 00:31:05,800
Scott: Yeah, because I mean, you know, while I, you know, I completely understand that, you know, there are many cases where unions need to exist, and I believe that and I will fight for those times, in my personal life, in the life of Scott Rubin, every interaction with unions has been a negative one, as in the unions have only caused Scott Rubin trouble.

576
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,472
Scott: A union has never given any benefit to Scott Rubin.

577
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:10,240
Scott: Only problems for Scott Rubin.

578
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:18,980
Rym: So I was a kid and the janitors went on strike at my school and because of the union stuff, nobody else was allowed to do the work.

579
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:23,113
Rym: So students weren't allowed to, for example, volunteer to sweep up the hallways.

580
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:25,320
Rym: That was union bullshit.

581
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:32,780
Rym: Or, I don't know, every convention we go to, we gotta pay some dude 80 bucks to walk down and plug in my laptop.

582
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:40,777
Rym: And it's not even that they need that money, it's just that they have... I hate the unions and convention centers.

583
00:31:40,797 --> 00:31:42,120
Rym: There's no need for that bullshit.

584
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,521
Scott: Yep.

585
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:52,832
Scott: I mean, the times I think when you need a union are when there is an employer who... There is not a wide choice of employers for a particular skill, right?

586
00:31:52,853 --> 00:32:01,240
Scott: Like, let's say, you know, everyone with computer skills, there was only Microsoft and there was really no one else to work for because Microsoft provided all computer services or the vast majority of them.

587
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,765
Scott: There's basically nowhere else to get a job, really.

588
00:32:04,146 --> 00:32:10,400
Scott: So if you have that particular skill set, your choices of employment are Microsoft or not employed.

589
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,900
Scott: So basically, Microsoft effectively owns you if that's your skill set and it would be too onerous for you to change your skill set in the middle of your life.

590
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,171
Rym: Or even another very similar example, a town where there are industries but there are not many.

591
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:26,220
Rym: Like, there are only a couple of employers, even if it's unskilled, completely unskilled labor.

592
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:34,120
Rym: If you're geographically limited and within a community there is a small number of employers, those employers have a lot of power over your lives.

593
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,531
Scott: Yes, for example, you live in a town and in that town there is a bread factory, right?

594
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:42,300
Scott: So 90% of the people who live in that area work in the bread factory.

595
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,300
Scott: Well, they could move somewhere to work in a different bread factory because they have bread and baking skills.

596
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,663
Rym: And now we have a free society.

597
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:49,666
Rym: They are free to do that.

598
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:55,240
Rym: But the reality is it is not necessarily that easy to pick up your family if you're poor and go somewhere else.

599
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,600
Scott: Yeah, bread factory, you don't make that much money unless you're the boss, in which case now you don't care, right?

600
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:10,760
Scott: So basically, the bread factory, because you live there, the bread factory owns you, kind of, indirectly, unless you make a union to gain some upper hand against the bread factory.

601
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:13,867
Scott: So, yeah, in those cases you need a union.

602
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:18,098
Scott: But, the fact is, a convention center does not need a union.

603
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,800
Rym: A convention center should not be able to obligate me to hire their shitty security and charge a ludicrous amount for it.

604
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,300
Rym: I should be able to hire my own security, whoever I want.

605
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,246
Scott: There are plenty of places to get jobs as security guard.

606
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:29,790
Scott: There's no reason they need to have a union.

607
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,937
Scott: There's plenty of places to get a job as a food service employee.

608
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:34,320
Scott: There's no reason they need a union.

609
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:34,941
Scott: There's.

610
00:33:34,961 --> 00:33:37,670
Scott: no, you know, there's no reason that the janitors need a union.

611
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,560
Scott: There are plenty of buildings to janitor in, besides convention centers.

612
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,051
Rym: Ah, but there's the problem in New York, at least, where, yes, there's plenty of buildings that all need janitors.

613
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:48,920
Rym: But it's mostly the kind of janitorial work that is needed mostly.

614
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,352
Rym: I mean, there are very skilled janitors, but most of what they need is basically unskilled labor.

615
00:33:53,774 --> 00:33:55,980
Rym: There is a nigh infinite labor pool.

616
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like if you don't have skills, right, even in a case where you maybe could use a union, like a geographic limitation, if your job is not a skilled job, your union doesn't really hold much sway, right?

617
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,524
Scott: That's the example you have at the free press.

618
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:18,518
Scott: Even though, you know, they thought they had skills of journalism, the fact is they didn't have skills of journalism.

619
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:19,420
Scott: The scabs were better.

620
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:27,940
Scott: So if you don't have skills that you're withholding from the employer, your union doesn't mean anything because they can take anyone off the street to do your job for you.

621
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,542
Rym: I feel like that's okay.

622
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:44,940
Rym: I guess what bothers me about a lot of unions is anytime there's a requirement to use the union or not, other than, you know, monopoly situations like if Microsoft were the only computer employer or, you know, everybody works in the coal mine because that's the only job in town.

623
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:52,000
Rym: In those situations, I feel like there should be kind of an elevated level of union power above and beyond kind of what I'm about to say.

624
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:57,350
Rym: But I think by and large, the way unions should generally work is that there should be a right to unionize.

625
00:34:57,691 --> 00:35:02,120
Rym: Employers should not in any way be able to punish people for forming a union.

626
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:02,778
Scott: No, not at all.

627
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,480
Rym: But at the same time, they should not be obligated to not hire union people.

628
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:09,121
Scott: Yeah.

629
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:11,607
Scott: I mean, you know, for example, let's say I get it.

630
00:35:11,687 --> 00:35:16,458
Scott: I happen to get a job at a place, right, that has and that job is unified.

631
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:17,380
Scott: I work in a factory.

632
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:17,560
Scott: Right.

633
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,583
Scott: And there's this union there.

634
00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:24,140
Scott: I should not be obligated to pay dues to that union unless I personally choose to do so.

635
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:27,227
Scott: And they should not be able to discriminate against me in any way.

636
00:35:27,247 --> 00:35:32,580
Scott: You know, if those people want to collectively bargain, why should I be forced to join their union?

637
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:39,600
Scott: And likewise, why should the employer, you know, unless, you know, be forced to not hire people, you know, who aren't in the union?

638
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,281
Scott: Right.

639
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:41,183
Scott: You know, it's bullshit.

640
00:35:41,784 --> 00:35:50,360
Scott: You know, it's it's like, you know, if those people feel that they are being treated poorly and they want to unionize, good for them.

641
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,771
Scott: But if I don't feel I'm treated poorly, why should I have?

642
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:54,599
Scott: why should I be forced to go in with them?

643
00:35:55,121 --> 00:36:00,800
Rym: When I worked at IBM, there was a big push and it was really like they were cracking down on it and people are getting fired all over the place.

644
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:05,960
Rym: A lot of the people in the site were trying to unionize a lot of the technical people and everything.

645
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:13,840
Rym: And it was this weird war where they'd leave like scary, poorly put together pro-union propaganda, like in the bathroom.

646
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:21,400
Rym: And in return, the company would put out these notices saying things like, here's why the union is a bad idea.

647
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:22,728
Scott: Yeah, that's something it's like.

648
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:24,760
Scott: companies can't force you not to unionize.

649
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Scott: But I remember reading a story once may or may not have been true about a guy who wanted to unionize the Wal-Mart he worked in.

650
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,182
Scott: Right.

651
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:33,340
Scott: Which I could see depending on where the Wal-Mart was might be a good idea.

652
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,540
Rym: A lot of Wal-Marts really are the only employer in an area.

653
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,041
Scott: Yeah.

654
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:42,580
Scott: And it's also generally not that you don't treat the employees particularly well in some cases.

655
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,283
Scott: It's not a good.

656
00:36:43,323 --> 00:36:46,440
Rym: But at the same time, look at, for example, Starbucks in cities.

657
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:50,560
Rym: They treat their employees very well, despite the fact that it's relatively unskilled labor.

658
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:50,942
Rym: Yeah.

659
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:52,510
Scott: Well, you need some training.

660
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:53,395
Scott: I mean, I couldn't do it.

661
00:36:53,436 --> 00:36:54,260
Scott: I need any training.

662
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,660
Rym: Scott, I could train you how to make coffee in a Starbucks.

663
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,814
Scott: Yeah, but you got to remember how to make all those different ones.

664
00:36:58,835 --> 00:36:59,540
Scott: You got to do them right.

665
00:37:00,381 --> 00:37:01,209
Rym: You realize there's little.

666
00:37:01,613 --> 00:37:02,360
Rym: it's not that hard.

667
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,940
Scott: There's a lot of different ones and I don't drink them, so I don't know what they taste like.

668
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,839
Scott: It's not that hard.

669
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,723
Scott: I don't know what's good.

670
00:37:06,743 --> 00:37:10,780
Scott: And, you know, it's like a bartender trying to be a bartender, but you never drink alcohol.

671
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,829
Rym: Yeah, actually, that is possible.

672
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:16,761
Rym: I mean, the age to be a bartender in Rochester was 18.

673
00:37:16,761 --> 00:37:20,180
Rym: And while I did drink alcohol when I was 18, I applied to be a bartender.

674
00:37:20,462 --> 00:37:22,738
Scott: Yeah, but you see the trouble here, right?

675
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:23,100
Scott: Anyway.

676
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:23,535
Scott: Anyway.

677
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,028
Scott: You have a significant disadvantage.

678
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:29,160
Scott: And so the thing is, what are we talking about?

679
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,840
Scott: You got me on the tangent about the bartending and the coffee making.

680
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,340
Rym: I kind of want to just get right to the whole teachers union thing, because this is why I'm so ambivalent about this issue.

681
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:39,784
Rym: Because there's too many conflating factors.

682
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:46,540
Rym: The fact that they're trying to give pay the teachers less than I pay in taxes, like that amazes me with anger and rage.

683
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:54,720
Scott: Yeah, it's like, hello, we need to pay teachers more so that we can actually attract quality people to be teachers and not just schmucks to be teachers.

684
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:58,260
Scott: And then that would make the children's better and so forth.

685
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,794
Rym: And also, there's the idea that, all right, maybe they can't afford it.

686
00:38:01,894 --> 00:38:03,260
Rym: Maybe the cuts have to happen.

687
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:05,420
Rym: I don't believe that, but say that's the case.

688
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:10,520
Rym: Why do they also need to remove the union's right to collectively bargain?

689
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:13,360
Rym: Why do they also need to take that away?

690
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:22,220
Rym: But to be ambivalent, I generally hate teachers unions because I feel like they actually are the causes of a lot of the problems in schools.

691
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,360
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure, you know, that every teacher's union is different, right?

692
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,566
Scott: But yeah, it is.

693
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:27,170
Scott: It's strange.

694
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,780
Scott: You have this teachers union, right?

695
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,390
Scott: And it's basically, it's getting beat up.

696
00:38:30,551 --> 00:38:32,040
Scott: So basically the teachers are getting screwed.

697
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:33,080
Scott: And I'm like, oh, that's bullshit.

698
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,099
Scott: Teachers, you know, I believe the teachers need to be paid a lot more money.

699
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:46,480
Scott: So, like I said, we can get high quality people to be teachers, which will then thus generate high quality students, which will, the future of the country and the world will be vastly improved.

700
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,520
Scott: And investment in better teaching is a much better use of money than anything else you can invest in.

701
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:58,560
Scott: Even, I could say, it's better to put money into teaching than I would put money there before I put it into healthcare or defense or a lot of other things.

702
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,639
Rym: Maybe defense, because if you don't have any defense, it doesn't matter how smart you are.

703
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,252
Scott: I don't have any defense, but the fact is that the vast majority of the U.S.

704
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:09,640
Scott: budget is defense and we could cut it back.

705
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,744
Rym: It depends on how you read it.

706
00:39:10,764 --> 00:39:14,960
Rym: There's another reading of our budget that says the vast majority of it is healthcare for old people.

707
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,480
Scott: I would still put money into the future rather than into the past.

708
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,820
Scott: I'm not saying no money for the old people.

709
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,600
Rym: So I was about to say, so you're saying death panels?

710
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:28,880
Scott: No, I'm saying that the education would be a higher priority than the old people.

711
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,980
Scott: And I would want the pie, I wouldn't want either pie to be zero.

712
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:36,640
Scott: I'm saying I would want the education pie slice to be bigger than the old people pie slice.

713
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:39,080
Scott: You want to invest your money in the future.

714
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,660
Scott: Investing in the past is like losing money.

715
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,580
Scott: Where putting it into the future is going to make things go up as time goes on, not down.

716
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:49,620
Scott: You're basically throwing money in the poop hole or you're throwing money in the bank.

717
00:39:50,863 --> 00:39:52,980
Rym: So do IT guys need unions?

718
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:55,096
Scott: Depends.

719
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:56,337
Rym: On what?

720
00:39:57,765 --> 00:39:58,940
Scott: On what kind of work you're doing.

721
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:08,780
Rym: IT has changed so much in the past decade that it's gotten to the point where the majority of IT work, I would argue, is barely skilled labor.

722
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,019
Rym: It is not any more difficult to do menial IT.

723
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,740
Rym: In fact, it is easier to do basic menial IT than it is to be a car mechanic.

724
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,660
Scott: It is incredibly easy, but very few people can do it.

725
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:21,199
Rym: I know, and that annoys me.

726
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,180
Scott: It's like this incredibly skilled job.

727
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:25,719
Scott: It's a really easy job.

728
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,780
Scott: But even when you train someone, they still can't do it.

729
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:31,899
Rym: But at the same time, IT workers are by and large treated like shit.

730
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,299
Scott: Many of them are treated like shit.

731
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,340
Scott: Not all, but many.

732
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:46,920
Scott: I think one thing that really makes it so that IT and computer science workers in general don't need to unionize is that the demand for the labor is much higher than the supply.

733
00:40:48,101 --> 00:40:57,460
Scott: Even though the certain positions are low skilled and others are high skilled, you can change employers almost at any time, depending on where you live, and make a ton more money.

734
00:40:57,821 --> 00:40:59,451
Scott: You don't need to unionize.

735
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:00,760
Scott: You just quit and go somewhere else.

736
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,420
Rym: It's only if you live in a major city.

737
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,177
Scott: Which most do.

738
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,180
Scott: Even outside of a major city, you can still easily change jobs to get more money.

739
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,019
Scott: I could change jobs and get more money at any time.

740
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:20,500
Scott: Another thing is that even if you don't have a union, IT workers still have a lot of leverage against the company that they work for.

741
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:28,075
Scott: Often, they will have some knowledge of some systems or control of some systems that if they quit, the company would be like, "Uh,

742
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:28,837
Scott: shit."

743
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:33,760
Scott: And they wouldn't easily be able to hire a replacement.

744
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:45,100
Scott: Every place I've ever worked, there have been legacy systems that have required some sort of... Sure, someone could come in and figure it out, but it'll take them time.

745
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,880
Scott: There's always going to be some special knowledge just for that system that is unique to that employer.

746
00:41:52,182 --> 00:41:56,860
Scott: If you work in a factory, you see a lot of the same machines factory after factory.

747
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,739
Scott: There's still a few things that are specialized for that one factory, right?

748
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:03,560
Scott: But they're not that complicated.

749
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:09,620
Scott: And they're usually provided by a vendor who they have a financial relationship with.

750
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:12,399
Rym: Have you ever worked in a factory?

751
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,600
Scott: I've been to factories.

752
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,125
Rym: You've never worked in one.

753
00:42:15,145 --> 00:42:18,940
Rym: I mean, I supported the production line at the fab at IBM for three years.

754
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:20,636
Rym: It's not quite like that.

755
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:30,939
Rym: In fact, there is a large amount of mechanical, technical work that needs to be done in factories independent of the workers who run the machines.

756
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:33,899
Scott: I'm talking about the people who run the machines.

757
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,319
Rym: Yeah, the people who run the machines, it's actually mostly unskilled work.

758
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:42,020
Scott: But the point is that you can be replaced easily.

759
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,660
Scott: There is no special knowledge that is unique to only that company.

760
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,620
Rym: But at the same time, you've got the people who actually work the machines, and it's very low-skilled.

761
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:55,460
Rym: There is a similar number of people who exist solely to maintain the machines, and there is basically nobody else.

762
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,433
Scott: Well, those are IT workers, basically.

763
00:42:57,453 --> 00:42:58,480
Scott: They're working with technology.

764
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,840
Rym: Yeah, you can argue that, except that is not what is taught in IT degrees.

765
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:03,918
Scott: No, it's not.

766
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:09,080
Scott: But I consider it maybe not an IT worker, but it's definitely a T worker.

767
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,897
Scott: You're not information technology, but you're still a technological worker, and a lot of the same things apply.

768
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,960
Rym: They're basically mechanics more than anything.

769
00:43:18,384 --> 00:43:19,980
Scott: Yeah, but how different is a mechanic?

770
00:43:21,162 --> 00:43:24,534
Scott: Sure, a lot of cars are very, very similar.

771
00:43:24,554 --> 00:43:26,340
Scott: If you can work on one car, you can work on others.

772
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:35,480
Scott: But if you work in, say, a Volkswagen dealership, there's going to be some specialized things just for Volkswagens that you learn all about.

773
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:40,840
Scott: And if you hire a guy who got fired from the Toyota dealership, he's going to have to learn those things.

774
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,004
Rym: Well, thus the rub.

775
00:43:42,084 --> 00:43:59,820
Rym: I feel like one of the big determiners of whether or not people actually want or need unions comes down to not whether or not they're able or willing, but whether or not the job itself, by and large, on average, allows people the chance to specialize and to gain specialized knowledge, even if that knowledge wasn't necessarily required to start the job.

776
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,352
Rym: For example, working in financials, I'm a fixed protocol expert.

777
00:44:04,552 --> 00:44:07,200
Rym: I know the fixed protocol like the back of my goddamn hand.

778
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:08,680
Rym: I deal with it on a daily basis.

779
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,778
Scott: There are plenty of other people who do.

780
00:44:10,062 --> 00:44:10,800
Rym: Not that many, though.

781
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,400
Scott: But not that many.

782
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:15,880
Rym: And because of the nature of my work, I did not need to know it getting into my job.

783
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:19,480
Rym: But at the same time, I had the opportunity to learn it in the course of my job.

784
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:27,600
Rym: And having the ability to learn a specialized skill, by and large, obviates the need for that individual person to care about a union.

785
00:44:27,961 --> 00:44:31,280
Scott: Right, because it's like if they fired you or treated you badly, right?

786
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,520
Scott: Not even if you couldn't quit and get a higher paying job elsewhere.

787
00:44:34,781 --> 00:44:41,140
Scott: If you tried to go on strike, just you on your own, you don't need to team up with anybody.

788
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:52,640
Scott: You alone can bargain with the company because if you left, they would have to get someone without that specialized skill, and it would financially damage them in terms of the time it took for that person to learn that skill.

789
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,520
Scott: So you don't need to team up with anybody because you alone have leverage.

790
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:03,240
Scott: Whereas if you do not have a lot of skill or a specialized skill, just you leaving doesn't hurt the company at all.

791
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:06,399
Scott: The only thing that could hurt them is if a bunch of you left all at once.

792
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:09,700
Scott: Then you would need multiples to get leverage.

793
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,480
Scott: I individually have a lot of leverage against almost any company I work for.

794
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,580
Rym: If only all those workers could come up with some sort of way to organize themselves and threaten to leave all at once.

795
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,396
Rym: Perhaps a union!

796
00:45:21,561 --> 00:45:33,520
Scott: But yeah, going back to the teachers' unions, it's a special case because at the same time, as I said, I think teachers need more money and I think we should give them more money to improve education of children and the future.

797
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:46,440
Rym: At least in the public perception and in my experience and my perception, a lot of unions, especially teachers' unions, tend to have a perverse set of incentives where they'll value something like seniority higher than actual skill.

798
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,960
Rym: I feel like seniority should have basically zero bearing on any form of advancement in any company.

799
00:45:52,260 --> 00:46:02,220
Scott: Yes, basically teachers' unions will basically fight and use their power to get certain policies enacted, which, while they are pro-teacher, are very anti-student.

800
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,200
Scott: It's not like the teachers are actively thinking that they want to hurt the students.

801
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:11,155
Scott: I don't believe that many teachers are malicious and say, "I want to fuck all the students over.

802
00:46:11,175 --> 00:46:11,898
Scott: Yeah, let's turn them into

803
00:46:11,918 --> 00:46:12,339
Scott: morons.".

804
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,660
Scott: There might be one or two teachers out there like that, but not many.

805
00:46:16,661 --> 00:46:18,360
Scott: But it's just a side effect.

806
00:46:19,562 --> 00:46:23,232
Scott: They think to themselves, "Tenure is a thing that exists.

807
00:46:23,412 --> 00:46:26,500
Scott: I want tenure so that I can have incredible job security.

808
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,610
Scott: I want job security.

809
00:46:27,711 --> 00:46:28,458
Scott: I want all these

810
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:28,720
Scott: things.".

811
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:34,070
Scott: Not realizing or making it a lower priority.

812
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:37,700
Scott: the fact that you having tenure actually hurts the students.

813
00:46:38,842 --> 00:46:40,748
Scott: Or, "You shouldn't judge me.

814
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:41,491
Scott: I'm a teacher.

815
00:46:41,511 --> 00:46:43,798
Scott: You shouldn't judge me based on how smart my students

816
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:44,039
Scott: are.".

817
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,674
Scott: Well, it's like, "No, actually we should for the good of the students.

818
00:46:48,694 --> 00:46:50,038
Scott: We should fire the crappy

819
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:50,500
Scott: teachers.".

820
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:57,240
Rym: I think there's a secondary problem in teaching, and I've realized it, that it's not just that they pay teachers by and large shit.

821
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,579
Rym: Coincidentally enough, they pay teachers the worst in the areas that need the best teachers.

822
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:12,560
Rym: But there's also this problem that, despite the fact that the salaries are very low for teachers, the barrier to entry is arbitrary and high.

823
00:47:13,841 --> 00:47:17,140
Rym: Me, right now, I think I could teach a pretty damn good computer class.

824
00:47:17,321 --> 00:47:19,580
Rym: I think I could actually teach math and things like this to a degree.

825
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,000
Scott: Yeah, and I don't even have any educational skills.

826
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,088
Rym: No school would let me teach high school.

827
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,320
Rym: No way would they let me be a teacher.

828
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:34,700
Rym: I'd have to, in the very least, get certified and go for my Master's and do all this BS, despite all the studies showing that having a Master's in no way correlates with student performance.

829
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:35,719
Scott: Nope, not at all.

830
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:42,420
Rym: I feel like there are a lot of people who want to be teachers for whom the money is not even the problem.

831
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:48,860
Rym: I think there are a lot of very dedicated people who are very passionate who would be teachers even accepting the low salaries.

832
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,360
Rym: But the barrier to entry is just too arbitrary and too high, and they are unable to even think about pursuing it.

833
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,060
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there are people I know like a lot of college professors, right?

834
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:02,920
Scott: Especially ones I had would, you know, because this summer vacation at school, right?

835
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,080
Scott: They would go work a real job in the summer, make a ton of money, and then teach at college the rest of the year because that's what they liked.

836
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:14,520
Scott: I had high school professors who were actually college professors, and they would drive back and forth between the college and the high school.

837
00:48:14,983 --> 00:48:17,660
Rym: Yeah, actually one of the best teachers I ever had in high school.

838
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:24,600
Rym: He's the one who turned me from someone who enjoys grammar to someone who, shall we say, is a lover of grammar.

839
00:48:25,023 --> 00:48:27,060
Rym: He's the one who turned me on to the lively art of writing.

840
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:28,420
Scott: A quality teacher?

841
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:37,660
Rym: He carried a handgun to school and was a lawyer for very big, kind of dangerous federal criminal cases outside of school.

842
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,740
Scott: Do you ever get in trouble for bringing a handgun to school?

843
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:46,060
Rym: I don't know if the school knew or if they signed it in or what, but he definitely had a handgun with him all the time.

844
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:46,505
Scott: Whoa.

845
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,860
Rym: Yeah, he kept it in his briefcase.

846
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,640
Scott: Oh, okay, but it wasn't like he had it on his hip.

847
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,760
Rym: No, it wasn't like he's wearing it in class.

848
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,840
Scott: Okay, I was going to say.

849
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:54,557
Rym: But he had it with him.

850
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,256
Scott: All right.

851
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,860
Scott: I'm sure if he got caught today, that would be, you know, the worst all over the news.

852
00:49:03,784 --> 00:49:04,820
Rym: I think we've about wrapped this up.

853
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,560
Rym: I mean, it's difficult for us to talk about it.

854
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:16,540
Scott: It's just one of those things, another one of those political issues where the vast majority of people you talk to have a simplistic, one-sided black or white opinion.

855
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,538
Scott: They're either like, "Yeah, union teamsters," or they're like, "All unions must

856
00:49:20,598 --> 00:49:21,040
Scott: die.".

857
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:31,720
Rym: Well, my trouble is that my opinion is strong as it is, and yet it doesn't affect me directly because I am not the kind of person who will ever need or be involved with a union.

858
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,200
Scott: No, but it is sort of like a homeowner's association.

859
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:38,376
Scott: If I went to work somewhere and they said there's a union, I'd just be like, "Yeah, I'm not working

860
00:49:38,396 --> 00:49:38,496
Scott: here."

861
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:44,268
Scott: Or if I went to go do business with a place and they had a union and it was like a convention center.

862
00:49:44,308 --> 00:49:51,320
Scott: that was getting in my way and I had an option to go somewhere else that did not have the union, that would not get in my way, I would be very likely to pick the other place.

863
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:55,052
Scott: Even though I respect the need of some workers to unionize.

864
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:07,160
Rym: I guess the point is that is it not worrying to you that people like us who by and large are not affected by this issue seem to have more complex opinions than the majority of people who talk about the issue?

865
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:17,940
Scott: Well, I think that people, it's one of those things where when you get, a lot of people when they argue about anything, for example, if you wanted to talk about teachers unions with a teacher, they would disagree with the hell with us.

866
00:50:19,801 --> 00:50:32,200
Scott: People would take their opinion, if I was arguing with a teacher on television about teachers unions and I studied up and I went to it, people would take the teacher's opinion as more valid than mine just from the get-go because they're a teacher.

867
00:50:32,761 --> 00:50:34,179
Scott: I'm a computer guy, what do I know about it?

868
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:42,200
Rym: But Scott, at the same time, when we go and talk about computers, shouldn't people take our opinion more highly than other non-computer people?

869
00:50:42,781 --> 00:50:54,180
Scott: But the thing is, is that from my perspective, there are cases, this being one of them, where when you're too close to the issue, you can't see the forest for the trees, right?

870
00:50:54,561 --> 00:51:01,940
Scott: And I think that as just being someone who just looks at many, many things from afar on the internets, right?

871
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:06,540
Rym: It's lovely being up in our ivory tower looking down upon the masses.

872
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:15,496
Scott: I see a lot of forests, but I don't see a lot of trees, so I'm sure there are plenty of things that I don't see up close, right?

873
00:51:15,816 --> 00:51:18,000
Scott: Lots of small details, right?

874
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,290
Rym: I'm sorry, I was going to say something really horrible when you said that.

875
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:23,617
Rym: I was going to say vaginas.

876
00:51:23,857 --> 00:51:24,640
Scott: I'm sorry.

877
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:25,503
Scott: Whatever.

878
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,639
Scott: Where does that even come from?

879
00:51:28,743 --> 00:51:29,840
Rym: Nothing, just a joke.

880
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:30,501
Scott: Alright.

881
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:32,239
Scott: I'm like, how does that relate to this?

882
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:35,760
Rym: It's things that you are not likely to see up close.

883
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,641
Scott: Okay.

884
00:51:36,922 --> 00:51:43,494
Scott: Anyway, so there's many details of a unionized situation that I would not see.

885
00:51:43,675 --> 00:51:46,400
Scott: I don't know how to collectively bargain or anything like that.

886
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:54,400
Scott: But there are still many things that I see from afar that the people who you would take their word more seriously do not realize.

887
00:51:54,841 --> 00:52:01,140
Scott: And they probably couldn't have been made to realize because they're so close to the situation, they can't get it exactly right.

888
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:07,400
Scott: And you need to combine those, you know, the far away view and the close view to get the true picture of how things really work.

889
00:52:07,821 --> 00:52:10,279
Rym: Ah, the disinterested and enlightened opinion.

890
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:10,994
Scott: Yes.

891
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,506
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

892
00:52:18,566 --> 00:52:23,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

893
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,960
