00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,644
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 3rd, 2011.

2
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:11,707
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:13,071
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:14,835
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:20,621
Rym: Tonight, Portal 2.

6
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:21,639
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,260
Rym: So every year I want to do this, but for some reason every year something came up like on the weekend.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:39,840
Rym: But this year I was in the city, there was nothing going on, so I went to the Sakura Matsuri downtown in the... Well, down downtown in Brooklyn at the Botanical Gardens.

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,414
Scott: Alright.

10
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:42,484
Rym: And it was actually pretty awesome.

11
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:48,120
Rym: It was like, you know in the anime you see the cherry trees and they're just completely full of their little blossoms all over the place?

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,680
Scott: Yeah, like the one right outside my window?

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,186
Rym: Yep, it was exactly like that.

14
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,177
Rym: This whole just sea of cherry trees.

15
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:53,800
Rym: It was pretty great.

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,980
Scott: Do they actually have cherries to eat?

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,442
Rym: No.

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,651
Rym: Then why?

19
00:00:56,712 --> 00:00:57,180
Scott: What's the point?

20
00:00:57,921 --> 00:01:01,820
Rym: Okay, well some other humans enjoy the aesthetics of things.

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,450
Scott: Yeah, I can see the tree outside my window.

22
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:06,300
Scott: I don't need to go see a more different tree.

23
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:11,200
Rym: Yeah, kind of like how you don't need to climb any more mountains because you walked up one mountain once a long time ago.

24
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:13,020
Scott: Walked up a lot more than one mountain once.

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:22,200
Rym: Anyway, so what I note that was interesting, I mean it was a fun time, I very much enjoyed it, it was beautiful, but a lot of people were there.

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,544
Rym: A lot of people.

27
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:27,180
Rym: The Botanical Garden raised its prices just for that day.

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:27,885
Rym: Alright.

29
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,019
Scott: Isn't there a law against that?

30
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:32,860
Rym: I don't know, but it was like $15 to get in unless you were a member.

31
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,226
Rym: Okay.

32
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:39,260
Rym: I also learned if you're a member, which is like $50 a year, it's free to go in anytime you want.

33
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,520
Scott: Yeah, that's how most memberships work.

34
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,954
Rym: Yeah, but for the Botanical Garden that's actually a pretty damn good deal.

35
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:46,079
Rym: I would probably do that.

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,564
Scott: All the memberships are a good deal.

37
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:52,240
Scott: Have you actually looked at any, every museum pretty much or any gallery or anything?

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,205
Rym: Yes, I have looked at them.

39
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:56,220
Rym: The stupid Lincoln Center tries to make me be a member constantly.

40
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,440
Scott: And how much do they charge?

41
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,940
Rym: Thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars.

42
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,440
Scott: Right, but what do you get for your membership?

43
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:03,038
Rym: Not that much.

44
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:04,979
Scott: You don't get a ticket to every single show?

45
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:07,460
Rym: I have to pay for those on top of the membership.

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,420
Scott: Oh, really?

47
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:13,900
Scott: Because usually when you become a member of something like that, it's basically a subscription to the whole season of shows.

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,860
Rym: Now, I could subscribe individually to, say, the symphony, but I can't even afford that.

49
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:19,920
Scott: Yeah, well, that's a lot of money.

50
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,819
Rym: It would be cheaper to get season tickets to the fucking hockey games.

51
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:25,224
Scott: That's the other thing.

52
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:27,352
Scott: Sporting season tickets, right?

53
00:02:27,432 --> 00:02:29,680
Scott: It's always surprising because you're like, okay, hockey.

54
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:33,352
Scott: It's a hundred and something dollars a seat, right?

55
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:35,580
Scott: So let's say it's a hundred and fifty dollars a seat.

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,986
Scott: And how many games are there?

57
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:37,750
Scott: I don't even know.

58
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,720
Scott: Like, maybe fifty games?

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,100
Scott: But then when you multiply and it's like, well, fifty games times a hundred, it's like, oh, it's like five thousand dollars for a season ticket.

60
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,320
Rym: For every game.

61
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,356
Scott: Yeah, but you're getting every goddamn game.

62
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:52,818
Scott: It's like, whoa.

63
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,567
Scott: And baseball, it's like, all right, ninety games.

64
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:57,693
Scott: I'll get forty dollar seats.

65
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:00,120
Scott: That's, oh, thirty six hundred dollars.

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,700
Scott: I can go to every baseball game.

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,840
Rym: If I were idly wealthy and didn't have to work because a lot of games are on weekdays.

68
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:06,599
Scott: I know, right?

69
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,700
Rym: I mean, hockey games are great, but nothing's worse than leaving a hockey game at eleven o'clock at night with work the next day.

70
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,940
Scott: Like, the individual tickets seem so expensive, but then when you multiply, it is a lot of money.

71
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,600
Scott: It's thousands of dollars, which not many people can afford.

72
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:25,600
Scott: But when you consider the fact that that's every game, it's like, huh, that really isn't that bad for every single goddamn game.

73
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,560
Rym: That time is the factor, not the money.

74
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,800
Scott: Yeah, and the other, my parents used to have hockey season tickets in the old, like, the seventies.

75
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,756
Scott: But in those days, it was a lot cheaper.

76
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,639
Rym: And my family used to see the Red Wings at the Colosseum.

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,820
Rym: So, anyway, something interesting about the Mott City.

78
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:45,820
Rym: There were a lot of people there in cosplay.

79
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:46,298
Rym: Yeah.

80
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,800
Rym: A lot of people.

81
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,020
Scott: That's because all the anime New York communities really pushed that event.

82
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,980
Rym: No, no, no, so there's different degrees here.

83
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,320
Rym: Because on one hand, there were people in traditional Japanese garb celebrating the holiday.

84
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,360
Scott: Were they Japanese people?

85
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:00,300
Rym: Most of them were.

86
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,529
Rym: Yep.

87
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,799
Rym: Some of them weren't, but they were in traditional garb.

88
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:11,440
Rym: Then, the next step removed were the people who were dressed up as anime characters, but at least they looked reasonably respectable.

89
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:15,380
Rym: Then there were the people who were dressed up as unrelated anime characters.

90
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Rym: They were just dressed up as, like, a Pokemon or a Gurren Lagann character.

91
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,420
Rym: And then there were the people cosplaying as things that aren't even Japanese.

92
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:26,219
Rym: There was the guy dressed up as a creeper.

93
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:30,520
Rym: There was a bunch of people dressed up as characters from Left 4 Dead.

94
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,599
Rym: They were there in a big group.

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,159
Scott: Yeah.

96
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:41,340
Rym: I just found this interesting that all these, because anime subculture at conventions is kind of like its own culture, almost independent of the anime.

97
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:50,940
Rym: If there's any event in New York City that in any way is remotely linked to anime, there's this same group of people that show up to every one of them wearing costumes.

98
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,240
Scott: I mean, that event is basically an anime convention, right?

99
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,440
Scott: All the anime communities in New York, Japan Society constantly has cosplay parties.

100
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:13,360
Scott: It's basically Japan Society and the New York Anime Festival and Kinokuniya and that related group of entities that really milks and pushes that culture and caters to that culture.

101
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,840
Rym: I think it proves something more that there's a critical mass, that conventions exist where they do because people want that all the time.

102
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:30,180
Rym: But in New York, there's just so many people that you pick any random day and if you put an event anywhere in the bounds of the city, you have critical mass for that event.

103
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:33,140
Rym: If it is related to a sort of nerdy, geeky culture.

104
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,120
Scott: Yeah, I mean, the same thing happens, though, at the DC Sakura thing, right?

105
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,656
Scott: All the all the DC area.

106
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:40,508
Rym: I didn't say it doesn't.

107
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,980
Rym: My anecdotal evidence is all in New York because that's where I am.

108
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,479
Scott: But I know for a fact that all the DC area, like, you know, the DC anime society.

109
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,080
Rym: You don't have to say but, I wasn't disagreeing with you.

110
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,271
Scott: It's not just a New York thing.

111
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:50,159
Scott: It's anywhere.

112
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:51,478
Rym: I didn't say it was.

113
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,004
Scott: You did.

114
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:53,380
Scott: You said in New York specifically.

115
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,280
Scott: The fact is anywhere there is any event even remotely related.

116
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,120
Rym: I didn't say New York because that happened to be the example I happen to have been talking about just now.

117
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,420
Rym: But anyway, these this had basically- None of the words I said excluded other cities.

118
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,520
Scott: The point is, is this happens everywhere that there is anything even close to an anime convention.

119
00:06:12,181 --> 00:06:13,427
Rym: I didn't say that wasn't true.

120
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:16,400
Rym: I just thought it was interesting because I hadn't run afoul of it.

121
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,539
Scott: I had run afoul of it many years ago.

122
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,208
Rym: When?

123
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:19,639
Rym: Where?

124
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,058
Scott: Just by seeing the internets.

125
00:06:22,102 --> 00:06:22,508
Rym: Uh huh.

126
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:23,379
Rym: Okay.

127
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:25,998
Rym: You got a news?

128
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:27,696
Scott: Oh, it's news time, huh?

129
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:28,040
Scott: Alright.

130
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,020
Rym: Well, because you don't seem to care.

131
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:29,958
Scott: Not really.

132
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,440
Scott: So, you want to talk about Sony pooping?

133
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:34,852
Rym: They're a terrible company.

134
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:35,520
Rym: I mean, what can we say?

135
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,880
Rym: They've had terrible customer service for the last decade.

136
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,659
Scott: Well, they've had terrible everything for the last decade.

137
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,446
Rym: Not everything.

138
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:42,639
Rym: Their TVs are actually pretty good.

139
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:45,228
Rym: Yeah, but- Their camcorders are really good.

140
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:47,160
Rym: Their consumer electronics in general are really good.

141
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,104
Scott: But that's the thing.

142
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:51,200
Scott: You know, a Sony camcorder, alright, it's not, you know, the worst thing ever.

143
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,859
Scott: But it's, you know, it's still, it pushes like memory stick and you can get a better one.

144
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:57,580
Rym: Most of the Sony camcorders I've seen don't use memory stick.

145
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,122
Scott: I don't know.

146
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:00,580
Scott: Every Sony camera I've seen has memory stick.

147
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,380
Scott: Some of them also have SD, but they're still pushing memory stick, as far as I can tell.

148
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,600
Scott: So, if they also support SD- But who the hell wants that shit memory stick?

149
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:09,931
Rym: We just don't use it.

150
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:10,700
Rym: Doesn't it hurt?

151
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,419
Scott: It's still on there.

152
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:11,684
Rym: So?

153
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,201
Scott: So, that doesn't, it makes it, you know, worse than another- See, it's weird.

154
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:22,020
Rym: I think Sony is a pretty terrible company, but I don't feel the need to pick on them for things that aren't really that big of a deal.

155
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,440
Rym: I would pick on them for things like, including DRM that broke audio CDs back in the day.

156
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,630
Scott: No, it was not DRM that broke audio CDs.

157
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,960
Scott: It was audio CDs that installed rootkits if you put them in a PC.

158
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,885
Scott: Ah, no, no, no, you know what it was?

159
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:36,680
Rym: You could argue that they weren't actually technically audio CDs.

160
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:38,119
Scott: That's also true.

161
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:47,180
Scott: But it was CDs that were pretending, that claimed to be audio CDs, that if you put them into a computer running Windows, would install a rootkit via autoplay.

162
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,900
Rym: They were on the forefront of broken, failed DRM techniques on almost everything.

163
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,800
Scott: Well, I mean, that's been the history of Sony for decades, is proprietary formats.

164
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,259
Scott: UMD, well, MiniDisc wasn't really proprietary, but they pushed it.

165
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,240
Rym: No, they are succeeding in one important area.

166
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:04,306
Scott: Buraying?

167
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:05,720
Scott: A completely unsuccessful area?

168
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,808
Rym: No, they actually, so, here's my statistic, but let me finish.

169
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:13,105
Rym: The first half of this is that Blu-ray sales are up 20%.

170
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:14,160
Rym: Like, they're really growing.

171
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,202
Rym: The second half is that home movie buying of any kind is down, like, 40%.

172
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:25,240
Rym: So they're an increasing share of a rapidly decreasing market.

173
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,645
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much, you know, how I see it too.

174
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:33,900
Scott: It's like, you know, friggin' digital movies are eating the lunch of physical movie buying.

175
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,408
Scott: There's no reason to buy a physical movie.

176
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:39,960
Scott: I mean, if you got Netflix and they're sending you physical movies, alright.

177
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:46,759
Scott: If you got a box set of DVDs of an anime, like, you buy Fist of the North Star box set for 30 bucks, alright, that makes sense.

178
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,194
Rym: One thing, I will buy a show on physical media if, one, it is cheap.

179
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:54,000
Rym: I'm talking, like, effectively free.

180
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:55,980
Scott: Two, you rip it and get rid of the discs.

181
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,080
Rym: Now, well, two, if it's something I want to lend to people regularly and/or rewatch a lot.

182
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,446
Rym: Now, if it's the second case, yeah, I'll just rip it.

183
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:08,380
Rym: Lending, yeah, I'll give people the DVDs because that's actually easier than giving them digital files.

184
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,760
Rym: For most of our friends and most people out there, yeah.

185
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,760
Scott: At least, yeah, it is.

186
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,898
Rym: Scott, try to give, Scott, Pete, our friend Pete, try to send him four gigs right now.

187
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:17,460
Rym: I can do that.

188
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:20,700
Scott: Yeah, if I had your files, I could, but his download is too slow.

189
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,148
Scott: Yep.

190
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:34,020
Scott: And, I mean, I could try to give it to him on, like, a USB stick or an external hard drive, but it's actually the bandwidth of giving him, just physically handing him four gigabyte DVDs, especially if it's a box set, is a lot faster.

191
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,720
Rym: Of course, it would probably be even faster just to tell him to download it from the Pirate Bay and seed.

192
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:41,123
Scott: That is also true.

193
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:50,260
Scott: But, yeah, physical media is dead, so Booray is pretty much, like, the last physical media, and, you know, it's like, I guess...

194
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,550
Rym: The last DVD I bought was something that I couldn't get on Netflix and we needed to watch.

195
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,229
Rym: It's a total recall, and I bought it for $1.50.

196
00:09:59,229 --> 00:09:59,440
Rym: Used.

197
00:09:59,784 --> 00:09:59,896
Rym: Used.

198
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,461
Rym: Used.

199
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:01,323
Scott: All right.

200
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:05,995
Scott: You could have gotten it from Netflix as DVD and ripped it.

201
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:07,840
Scott: You just couldn't get it on Netflix streaming.

202
00:10:09,262 --> 00:10:10,815
Scott: You still haven't watched Total Recall.

203
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:11,339
Scott: We gotta watch it.

204
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:13,640
Rym: I've seen Total Recall, like, ten times.

205
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,865
Scott: I've also seen it ten times.

206
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:18,320
Scott: The reason we bought it is because a lot of people with us have not watched it.

207
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,520
Scott: The girls have not seen it.

208
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,740
Scott: We planned to watch it, and, you know, I could see it again since it's been a long time.

209
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,540
Rym: Well, I invited you over on Sunday to watch it, but you were busy.

210
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:26,360
Scott: I was busy.

211
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,680
Rym: Yeah, well, we were doing something.

212
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,220
Scott: I was doing something, working on shit, as opposed to watching movies.

213
00:10:32,524 --> 00:10:33,718
Rym: I was working on the project.

214
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:48,960
Scott: But anyway, we didn't even talk about Sony's epic fail, right, which is that the PSN, PlayStation Network, right, was totally hacked, and then they sort of meekly, you know, because they couldn't even hold it up, they were so shitty, they had to just take it down.

215
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,360
Scott: And then, even when it was down, it got hacked again, even though they planned to bring it back up partially, like, this week.

216
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,220
Rym: Never mind the fact that they basically lied about and tried to hide the extent of the outage forever.

217
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:01,268
Rym: Now, it's possible.

218
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:02,860
Rym: they're just incompetent and they didn't know the extent.

219
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:04,560
Scott: Sony's been incompetent for a long time.

220
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:11,440
Rym: Now, many people on the internet are trying to make the argument that, you know, "Oh, well, Sony should have done this differently.

221
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,728
Rym: Here's all these IT practices they're just violating.

222
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:16,679
Rym: They weren't doing the, you know, the obvious standard security

223
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:16,900
Rym: thing.".

224
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,616
Scott: They obviously weren't.

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:30,920
Rym: Now, the reason that's a stupid argument is that once you go out into the real world and you work for any company, you will learn that no companies follow best practices.

226
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,459
Scott: That's also true.

227
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:32,946
Rym: Fucking nobody.

228
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,130
Rym: The financials.

229
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:36,760
Rym: Nobody has security worth a shit.

230
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,241
Scott: That's true.

231
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:38,787
Scott: Except for maybe the government.

232
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:40,093
Scott: Even then, not really.

233
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:41,880
Scott: Only in some parts.

234
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,660
Rym: The stuff I personally maintain, I can vouch for the security somewhat, except for the fact that some other people know the root password and I don't have any control over that.

235
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,800
Scott: Yeah, the stuff that I personally maintain, I mean, is secure in all the ways that matter.

236
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,320
Rym: Well, again, we don't have anyone else's data.

237
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,239
Scott: There's nobody else to make it secure except for me.

238
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:11,300
Scott: And the thing is, I know many ways I can make it more secure and I have mapped them out and plan to do them, but they keep giving me other work to do instead because they don't make it a priority, even though I make it a priority.

239
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:17,260
Scott: So I do not have time or manpower to implement these things quickly to make it even more secure.

240
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:24,460
Scott: But once I do, it would actually be as secure as it could possibly need to be realistically without being a huge pain in the ass.

241
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:30,020
Rym: Oh, someone steals the database of all our publicly available Creative Commons shows.

242
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,189
Scott: Yeah, you can't really hurt gig nights.

243
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,200
Scott: It's kind of more secure than most companies.

244
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,400
Rym: If you were really good, you could deface our site for like 10 minutes before we fixed it.

245
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,406
Scott: Yeah, I got backups and shit.

246
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,590
Scott: What are you gonna do?

247
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:45,694
Scott: They're in my house.

248
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:47,140
Scott: Are you gonna come into my house and steal them?

249
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,656
Scott: It's like, what are you... you know, you can't...

250
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,620
Rym: I guess someone could try to get past my doorman, break into my apartment, and steal the NAS above my desk.

251
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:07,400
Scott: But basically, the thing that I said on Twitter that got everyone mad, but I kind of believe it, but half-trolling, is that if you bought a PlayStation and you got hacked, you sort of deserve it, right?

252
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:17,401
Scott: I mean, not that, you know, you deserve to be hacked straight up, but yeah, you deserve basically some suffering for making a stupid decision of buying a PlayStation 3.

253
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:26,600
Rym: Now, what if you're one of the people for whom some number of the exclusive titles on the PlayStation 3 were games you wanted, and money wasn't really an object?

254
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,487
Scott: Then...

255
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,455
Rym: I mean, I bought a fucking Xbox for one game.

256
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:31,280
Rym: Street Fighter.

257
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,605
Scott: Okay, that is a true thing, Rym.

258
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:39,700
Scott: You are correct in saying that there are some people out there, right, who are not like us, and the games on the PlayStation 3 are the games that they prefer.

259
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,799
Rym: And that, I mean, that's fine.

260
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,636
Scott: And then they want a PlayStation 3, and maybe they're super movie nerds, and they don't care about money, and they're willing to buy Blu-ray discs for a lot of money, because they need to see movies in HD, because they're

261
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:51,878
Rym: movie nerds, even though

262
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,400
Scott: Blu-ray won't last that very long.

263
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,720
Rym: If you wanted a Blu-ray, that was the cheapest way to get one for a long time.

264
00:13:58,422 --> 00:13:59,526
Scott: Now, here's what I have to say.

265
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:03,920
Scott: Most of these PlayStation games, these people really like, that are exclusive to the PlayStation, right?

266
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,184
Scott: These are multiplayer games.

267
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:10,414
Scott: These are like single-player JRPGs, so you didn't even need to go on the PlayStation Network.

268
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:12,620
Scott: You didn't even have to play those games.

269
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,780
Rym: Ah, but you can't blame the victim.

270
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:17,820
Scott: I can kind of blame the victim.

271
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:23,200
Scott: What I'm doing is I'm blaming someone who got lung cancer for smoking.

272
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,419
Rym: Ah, but are they the victim, or are they the criminal and the victim?

273
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,747
Scott: I also blame the tobacco company.

274
00:14:28,808 --> 00:14:32,119
Scott: more so, but I also blame the smoker for smoking.

275
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:41,280
Rym: See, but in this case, Sony has a bad reputation for a lot of things, but Sony is not unique among similar companies in terms of its security situation.

276
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:41,971
Scott: Oh, no, not at all.

277
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:42,300
Rym: Not at all.

278
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,000
Rym: There is no way you can tell me that Microsoft is immune to this sort of thing.

279
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,006
Rym: Absolutely not.

280
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,879
Scott: I will not say that in any way, shape, or form.

281
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,338
Rym: However, I would argue that Microsoft is probably, because it's primarily a tech company...

282
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,078
Scott: More secure.

283
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:57,700
Rym: And that is really its only game?

284
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,134
Rym: That it probably has a lot more going on.

285
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:00,578
Rym: Sony...

286
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,860
Scott: Especially since Xbox is its most advanced and intelligent division.

287
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,269
Rym: Sony is a conglomerate.

288
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:06,840
Rym: Sony does fucking everything.

289
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,620
Rym: Sony has multiple wings that are in direct competition with each other.

290
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,200
Scott: Yeah, it's their problem.

291
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,880
Rym: Yeah, I mean, on one hand, they can make awesome consumer hardware.

292
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:22,120
Rym: On the other hand, they're in bed with the content creators who very specifically do not want there to be awesome consumer hardware.

293
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,697
Scott: And they ruin it all.

294
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:23,492
Scott: If I...

295
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:26,511
Rym: No, no, why do they listen to those people?

296
00:15:26,732 --> 00:15:28,399
Rym: The content creation industry...

297
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:38,580
Scott: Because the people... Look at... Go watch... If you want to know why Sony is stupid the way it is, go watch the video of the bosses of Sony apologizing for this break-in, right?

298
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:53,940
Scott: It's so Japanese old school guys who, you know... And it's so weird because on the one hand, the Japanese businessmen are all like Project X. But on the other hand, they're so... Their step is not trackless, right?

299
00:15:55,883 --> 00:16:01,240
Scott: They do things in one way, the Japanese way, and they can't veer from that path.

300
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,020
Scott: If I could own any company in the world, I would own Sony.

301
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:07,160
Scott: Because that ship is so big and so powerful.

302
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:16,060
Scott: And if a person with actual vision and understanding of technology was in charge, you could friggin' destroy everybody.

303
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:23,800
Scott: If Sony started veering off into the trackless step, it would be conquering the entire consumer electronics industry.

304
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,960
Scott: Panasonic, Apple, Microsoft... Everyone would get crushed.

305
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,380
Rym: A Sony-Google alliance would even be scarier because that would take over almost all media.

306
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,306
Scott: Yeah, no, but I wouldn't do that.

307
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,110
Scott: That's too dangerous.

308
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,009
Rym: Well, you saw that article a while ago.

309
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,279
Rym: that is absolutely true.

310
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,920
Rym: Effectively, the recording industry... Just talk about music.

311
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:49,540
Rym: Google or Sony or almost any major real company could literally buy the entire music industry.

312
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,574
Scott: I was talking about this the other day, and I don't want to go too long on this topic here, but I was talking with a coworker, right?

313
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:56,599
Scott: Think about this.

314
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,760
Scott: There are awesome... If you had tons of money, right?

315
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,960
Scott: There are awesome things that you could do with that money.

316
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:10,800
Scott: But what person who is ultra-rich in the history of the world has ever done something crazy awesome, right?

317
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,800
Rym: Bill Gates is trying to cure horrible diseases.

318
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,180
Scott: That's the perfect example that comes up, right?

319
00:17:18,181 --> 00:17:24,380
Scott: I've looked at that example closely, and I've realized what he's doing is really not as awesome as it could be.

320
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,324
Scott: I could be wrong.

321
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:26,650
Scott: I could be stupid.

322
00:17:26,891 --> 00:17:27,734
Scott: I could be stupid.

323
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,740
Scott: My math could be wrong.

324
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:31,740
Scott: I don't know finance, but let me run this down here, right?

325
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:37,100
Scott: Bill Gates is helping many people, mostly fighting malaria and other diseases in Africa, right?

326
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:42,320
Scott: He's actually, if you look closely at it, he's doing it in a slightly clever way, right?

327
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:49,480
Scott: Which could be viewed... A skeptic might say that it's evil, whereas I sort of view it as financially sustainable, right?

328
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,519
Scott: Where basically the company that provides all the drugs for the malaria, he bought that company, right?

329
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,840
Scott: So he basically... And then the money that he spends to buy the drugs goes to himself, right?

330
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,938
Scott: He's the company that he owns.

331
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:11,720
Scott: And then to convince the people to take the drugs that they're not evil, he buys the media companies in Africa and changes the advertising so that people think vaccines are good, right?

332
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,580
Scott: But in turn, so while he's saving the people, he's also making money, right?

333
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,012
Scott: But if you look at it that way, it's like, oh, it's evil.

334
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:21,540
Scott: But on the other hand, it's sustainable, right?

335
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:31,060
Scott: It's the money he's spending to help people goes back in, and he can turn it around to help the people again, as opposed to the money dissipating to, say, some pharmaceutical company, right?

336
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:33,725
Scott: I looked at this math, right?

337
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:39,020
Scott: What do you think the market cap of Merck or GlaxoSmithKline is?

338
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,080
Rym: All right, you're already getting into dangerous territory.

339
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,495
Scott: I know, but just guess.

340
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,619
Rym: All right, I don't even know, because those stocks actually don't even register on my radar.

341
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,160
Scott: All right, well, they're between like $50 and $60 billion to buy one of those companies.

342
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:56,671
Rym: All right.

343
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:03,060
Scott: If Bill Gates and Warren Buffett each took half of their net worths and combined them, right?

344
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,906
Scott: So basically they each take half their money.

345
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:08,880
Scott: They could buy either Merck or GlaxoSmithKline wholesale.

346
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:17,086
Scott: They could just buy one of those two companies, and then they could take all the patents of those companies and just release them to the world for free.

347
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:25,420
Scott: That would do more good in my eyes to help people around the entire world, you know, cure diseases than whatever they're doing in Africa.

348
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,900
Scott: Because suddenly all of those medicines, the prices of them would drop to almost nothing.

349
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:38,880
Rym: Question one, do they continue to operate those companies to generate further intellectual property, as in more cures to diseases?

350
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,007
Scott: They own the company.

351
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:41,034
Scott: The company doesn't shut down.

352
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:41,880
Scott: It just changes ownership.

353
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,120
Scott: They could continue to operate.

354
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,025
Rym: How profitable is it?

355
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:46,900
Rym: And if they give up all the patents, how much money will the company make?

356
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:47,760
Rym: How long will it last?

357
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Rym: How does it fund the further research?

358
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,060
Scott: That is a good question, but we do know this at the very least.

359
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:57,260
Scott: The pharmaceutical companies are insanely profitable.

360
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:00,691
Scott: Their profits have been going up year after year.

361
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:02,640
Scott: Their margins are very, very large.

362
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,580
Scott: They could eat, first of all, they could get rid of, if not all the patents, many of them to maintain profitability.

363
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:23,519
Scott: And likewise, the patents they still hold, they could lower those margins just out of the state, or they could make it into a nonprofit company and operate at a very close to zero margin, and be very slightly profitable to make sure it doesn't fold.

364
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:32,735
Scott: And that would still do more good for the entire world by providing cheap medicines of all kinds to everybody than just malaria in Africa.

365
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:33,640
Scott: But they don't do that.

366
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,820
Scott: Nobody thinks of doing something so bold and crazy and awesome that you would put in a manga, right?

367
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,440
Scott: They make the mangas afterwards of something like Project X, but you never see a sanctuary become real.

368
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,260
Rym: I'm going to sidestep the whole, you know, you still have to fund the further research and all those things.

369
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:51,920
Rym: And I'm going to tell you a story about the Hunt Brothers.

370
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:58,757
Rym: The Hunt Brothers tried to buy, effectively, all the silver in the world.

371
00:20:58,797 --> 00:21:00,020
Rym: They tried to buy silver.

372
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,080
Scott: You can't do that because that's an anti-trust.

373
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,265
Rym: No, that's not why you can't do that.

374
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:08,440
Rym: So if I try to buy a company outright like that...

375
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,220
Scott: The price keeps going up as you buy it.

376
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:16,720
Rym: The price goes up and the cost to buy it goes up at a slope that will approach infinity in many situations.

377
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,760
Scott: But you don't need to buy the whole company.

378
00:21:18,882 --> 00:21:20,978
Rym: No, you need to buy... Yes.

379
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:28,780
Scott: If they had to buy 100%, there's no way they couldn't do it because the market cap of Merck 100% is more money than they have combined.

380
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,200
Scott: They couldn't buy it all.

381
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:31,140
Rym: You want a hostile takeover.

382
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,760
Scott: They'd have to buy 51%.

383
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,944
Rym: You want to buy 51%.

384
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:39,480
Rym: The price is still going to go up, skyrocket, because the entire world will know exactly what you're trying to do.

385
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,339
Scott: You have to do it instantly.

386
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,027
Rym: That doesn't work.

387
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:43,860
Rym: That's not how the stock market works.

388
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:45,618
Scott: You got to do it...

389
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,520
Rym: So Scott, say there's a book, an order book, right?

390
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:51,460
Rym: And at the top are the prices that are close to the market.

391
00:21:52,041 --> 00:22:00,660
Rym: And there's like 100 shares at this price, 1,000 shares at one penny more, 10,000 shares at one penny more, going all the way down to billion dollar shares.

392
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,240
Scott: You don't want to buy the billion dollar share.

393
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,299
Rym: How do you buy them all at once?

394
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:10,020
Rym: If you set up a limit price, you're going to get everything in the book up to that point and everyone knows what you just did.

395
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,027
Scott: You have to slowly... You don't get the shares all at once.

396
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:15,160
Scott: You've got to make slow deals over time.

397
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,049
Scott: Again, it's public.

398
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:17,200
Rym: People know what you're doing.

399
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,540
Scott: No, you have to go and you have to meet the people who currently own most of the shares and just buy like all their shares at once.

400
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,144
Rym: You can't do that.

401
00:22:23,164 --> 00:22:23,730
Rym: You have to buy it.

402
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,740
Rym: It wouldn't work.

403
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,505
Scott: Like, hey, that guy owns 20%.

404
00:22:26,505 --> 00:22:31,500
Scott: Let's go talk to him and get him to hand over the 20% on paper in a contract in a room somewhere.

405
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,760
Scott: So that way we can get a big chunk instantly.

406
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,818
Rym: That's not going to happen.

407
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:37,299
Scott: Well, you know, everyone has a price.

408
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:46,980
Scott: And maybe those guys who already own huge chunks of the company, you could convince them to be good people and stop being dicks.

409
00:22:47,721 --> 00:22:48,257
Scott: It could happen.

410
00:22:48,762 --> 00:22:51,160
Scott: I think a better way around this... Like in an eagle style fashion.

411
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,024
Rym: Because you do realize we... That's just... Scott, I'll get off this topic.

412
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:58,040
Rym: We do need to fund further research and your plan would basically destroy that market.

413
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,820
Scott: I'm just saying is that's not... That particular example has many flaws, right?

414
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,699
Scott: But it's just an idea of the kind of thing that nobody does.

415
00:23:06,324 --> 00:23:08,120
Scott: Nobody does anything like that.

416
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,580
Rym: Yeah, well why doesn't Google just buy all the music companies?

417
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,899
Scott: They could, why don't they?

418
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,119
Rym: Yeah, what is that?

419
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:17,800
Scott: That's an even better example because there aren't any real gotchas.

420
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,172
Scott: It's like Google could just buy every record company.

421
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:20,454
Scott: Done.

422
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:21,260
Scott: Game over.

423
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,598
Rym: So anyway, to riff on another Japanese company.

424
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,236
Scott: Oh, those Japanese.

425
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:27,820
Scott: So silly.

426
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:33,680
Rym: There's been a lot of announcements lately of rumors and speculation about Project Cafe.

427
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,300
Rym: Otherwise known as Daddy's Second Wii.

428
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,695
Scott: Now here's the thing I want to say.

429
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:40,280
Scott: that's very short.

430
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,375
Rym: It's going to be announced at E3.

431
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:42,260
Scott: I know that.

432
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,160
Scott: But why do people keep saying Wii 2, right?

433
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,891
Scott: Because they didn't say GameCube 2.

434
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:48,360
Scott: They didn't say Super Nintendo 2.

435
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,449
Scott: So why are they saying Wii 2?

436
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:50,720
Scott: It's obviously going to have a different name.

437
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,440
Scott: It's not going to be called Wii 2.

438
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,522
Rym: Not that many people are calling it Wii 2.

439
00:23:54,522 --> 00:23:56,241
Scott: I heard a lot of people calling it Wii 2.

440
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,665
Rym: Google around.

441
00:23:57,685 --> 00:24:02,640
Rym: There were people calling the Wii GameCube 2 before they heard Revolution.

442
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,299
Rym: Before there was a project, people would say, "Yeah, when's GameCube 2 coming

443
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:07,400
Rym: out?".

444
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,400
Rym: Or people would say Super GameCube.

445
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,688
Scott: I like Super GameCube.

446
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:13,099
Scott: I would accept Super Wii.

447
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,184
Scott: I tweeted that.

448
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:16,360
Scott: I would accept Super Wii as an acceptable name.

449
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,660
Scott: But I would not accept Wii 2.

450
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,720
Scott: Notice Xbox and Playstation, they just up the numbers to maintain the brand.

451
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:27,780
Scott: But Nintendo's brand is Nintendo, so they can change the name of their console.

452
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,740
Scott: But the other companies, their brand isn't Microsoft Sony.

453
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,340
Scott: Their brand is Playstation Xbox, so they can't change the name.

454
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:43,200
Rym: Also, notice how the Playstation 3 was supposed to be the 10-year console, but I think the Xbox is going to be a 10-year console, too.

455
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,440
Rym: I don't think anything's changing in the console world market.

456
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,180
Scott: If the Playstation network didn't fail, the Playstation 3 probably is going to last a total of nine-ish years.

457
00:24:51,962 --> 00:25:11,480
Rym: I think that the industry internally, I would guess that secretly in Microsoft and in Sony, within a couple years, maybe within a year, I think they had originally planned, like when they made the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3, that a new Xbox would come out around that time, like next year sometime.

458
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:12,158
Scott: No, they didn't.

459
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:12,782
Scott: Vaguely.

460
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:25,340
Rym: I'm pretty sure they expected a normal cycle, and that they have continuously from day one internally extended the projected lifespan of the Xbox based on the fact that the market is kind of at this plateau.

461
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,057
Scott: Well, what helped them really is the Wii.

462
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:35,280
Scott: The Wii managed to only last five years, and the reason they have to upgrade it is because they put in weaker hardware.

463
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:59,340
Scott: So the lower power of the Wii allowed the other consoles to last longer, and basically the other consoles, because they were so powerful when they came out, they were more powerful than they needed to be, they can still crank out 1080p's just fine today, and 1080p's is still gonna be probably just fine two, three years down the road until 3D, if 3D ever happens on TVs in the house, which I don't think it's gonna, you know, be that big that quickly.

464
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:06,700
Rym: Of course, the Wii's strength was its gameplay, not its graphics, and that would've been fine except that Nintendo gave up on experimenting and didn't do anything cool.

465
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:21,234
Scott: Well, that's, uh, I think the other thing is that most of the experimenters, right, it wasn't so much that Nintendo gave up experimenting, which they did, it was that they blocked out experimenters, like, where's the Super Meat Boy on the Wii?

466
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:21,739
Scott: on Nintendo's jerks?

467
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,680
Rym: Well, look back in time!

468
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,379
Scott: So it didn't happen.

469
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:33,800
Rym: Look back in time, on the NES, the SNES, the GameCube was the end of this, it wasn't really accessible for the average dude who knew how to code to make games for consoles.

470
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,280
Scott: You could make Bible games Bible games.

471
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,460
Rym: So they would make PC games primarily, or nothing.

472
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:46,940
Rym: So on the consoles, it was Nintendo who was really pushing the envelope by making weird-ass games, or getting other people to make weird-ass games on their console.

473
00:26:47,820 --> 00:27:03,154
Rym: And now, it's kind of, everyone else, the indie scene is doing what Nintendo used to do, trying different things, doing weird stuff, and Nintendo basically gave up on all that, and is trying to capture the, I don't know, I hate to use the word "casual gamer market", but that's basically what

474
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:03,660
Scott: they're going after.

475
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,520
Scott: Nintendo's problem is that they're trying to sell you Angry Birds for 50 bucks, right?

476
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,900
Scott: That's their problem right now.

477
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,520
Rym: That's why I think the DS, and maybe, maybe...

478
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,878
Scott: There were a lot of people who looked at the 3DS, and they saw the 3DS games were 40 bucks, and were like, "Fuck

479
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:17,099
Scott: that.".

480
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:27,240
Rym: Well, Nintendo, for a long time, I think a fundamental reason why the Game Boy Advance and the Game Boy and everything were so popular is that, until recently, they were the only game in town.

481
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:30,620
Rym: There was nothing else that competed with the Game Boy line.

482
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:33,440
Scott: Because you couldn't buy Bejeweled for a dollar on your iPhone.

483
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,020
Rym: Yeah, and look at all these shitty games like Baby's Fashion, and Dogs.

484
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
Scott: You love that Baby's Fashion.

485
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,849
Rym: And Pets, and all these shit games.

486
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,020
Rym: that, shit tier is the only thing you can use to describe these games.

487
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,700
Scott: It's called shovelware.

488
00:27:47,102 --> 00:27:48,700
Rym: I prefer 4chan's shit tier.

489
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,499
Scott: It's shovelware.

490
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,260
Rym: There's God tier, and shit tier.

491
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:53,219
Scott: Chocolate and shit.

492
00:27:53,260 --> 00:28:00,260
Rym: So, these awful games don't sell now, because those people don't care where they get their games, and they all have smartphones.

493
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,399
Scott: Who's gonna pay $30 for brain training?

494
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,100
Rym: When they can pay $1 for brain train.

495
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:07,777
Scott: Yeah, whatever it is.

496
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:10,280
Rym: And they don't even play the game, they don't care.

497
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:19,440
Rym: So, I think Nintendo's era of handheld gaming dominance is over unless you don't count cell phone games.

498
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:27,000
Rym: I think they're gonna be the dominant force of handheld games that are actually real, big games.

499
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:33,820
Scott: Now, I would, right, worry, actually, because they're coming out with the new PSP, the PSP Next Gen.

500
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:41,660
Scott: And the PSP has been, you know, basically, sort of had this steady, sort of profitable market that hasn't exploded, but hasn't shrunk.

501
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,440
Rym: The PSP is the best competitor in actual games that Nintendo has ever had.

502
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,460
Scott: But the PSP Next Generation, right, I'm not, you know, I don't have high hopes for it, I'm probably never gonna buy one.

503
00:28:53,002 --> 00:28:57,416
Scott: But, it is gonna be, like, supposedly PS3 powerful.

504
00:28:57,677 --> 00:28:58,019
Scott: Like, whoa.

505
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,060
Scott: Like, you know, if you thought the PSP, I mean, the PSP screen, when you first saw it, was whoa, no matter what, right?

506
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,043
Scott: Now it's eh.

507
00:29:06,424 --> 00:29:11,640
Scott: But, the PSP Next Generation is probably gonna be like, whoa, it's HD, whatever.

508
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,860
Scott: And if it's gigantic, and it's Sony, so don't spend your money on it.

509
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,440
Scott: We already talked about why you don't give money to Sony.

510
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,199
Rym: It'll use some new, like, memory dick that you have to put in.

511
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,507
Scott: Yeah, who knows what it's gonna do.

512
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:22,460
Scott: It'll just rape your children as soon as you open the box.

513
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,644
Rym: Well, look at the progression, though.

514
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:27,840
Rym: You know, thinking about that, it used to be Game Boy didn't have any competition, really.

515
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:30,366
Rym: Game Boy Color, no competition.

516
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:34,980
Rym: Game Boy Advance, probably the best console in the history of consoles.

517
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:36,800
Scott: DS, I think, is better than DBA.

518
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:49,040
Rym: The DS was a direct extension of that, but the DS, while it didn't really have any real competition, it moved in a direction of experimenting, as opposed to, the Game Boy Advance was the last in a long line of just incremental improvement.

519
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:57,940
Rym: And then suddenly the DS was, oh, we'll do something different and cool, and then Nintendo, that and the GameCube were the last times they experimented.

520
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,386
Rym: The 3DS doesn't look like it's doing anything cool.

521
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:02,212
Rym: At least gameplay-wise.

522
00:30:02,513 --> 00:30:05,000
Rym: 3D is all it's got, and you know what, it's not that impressive.

523
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:11,134
Scott: Yeah, the 3D has not changed the gameplay in the way that the stylus has.

524
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:12,256
Scott: The stylus was huge.

525
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:13,820
Scott: The dual screens was huge.

526
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:18,380
Scott: The 3D hasn't made nearly the kind of impact that either of those two things has made.

527
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:21,459
Rym: Yup, and there's no launch title, so I'm not buying one.

528
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,260
Scott: You know, I wouldn't mind playing pilot wings in a steel driver submarine game, but I'm not going to pay for them.

529
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,247
Rym: I shouldn't have bought the DS when it came out.

530
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,240
Rym: I should have waited until Advance Wars came out for the DS.

531
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,739
Scott: The DS Lite.

532
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,116
Rym: Yeah, so I'm waiting for the 3DS Lite.

533
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,220
Scott: Yeah, if they come out with the 3DS Advance Wars, you're going to be forced to buy one.

534
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,279
Rym: I would probably still, well, you know what, I don't think they will.

535
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,398
Scott: What if it's actually a 3D Advance Wars, you can go up and down and see your guys in 3D?

536
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:50,060
Rym: Oh my god, but I'd still wait, probably.

537
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,280
Scott: For the 3DS Lite?

538
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:52,259
Rym: Probably.

539
00:30:52,920 --> 00:31:02,980
Rym: But the moral of all this, I want to get to Portal, is that Project Cafe, much like the 3DS, my personal opinion is that Nintendo's got to prove to me why I should buy it.

540
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:09,140
Rym: As opposed to the last 20 years of my life where Nintendo didn't have to do anything but take money from me.

541
00:31:09,721 --> 00:31:11,660
Rym: Now they have to show me something before I give them their money.

542
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:17,260
Scott: It's weird, when we started out with GeekNights, it was all, you know, Nintendo is the win, we don't care what people say.

543
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,119
Scott: Because back then it was.

544
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,440
Scott: PC gaming is dying and now PC gaming is the king, again, phone gaming is now existing.

545
00:31:25,102 --> 00:31:29,500
Rym: Look at that era, the GameCube and the DS were on this chart.

546
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,140
Rym: The amount of potential in both of those consoles that to this day remains untapped is staggering.

547
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:43,680
Rym: And Nintendo basically decided that they don't care about that rich mine of silver because they found a shit mine.

548
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,520
Scott: Well, you know, if you mine all the silver, the price just keeps skyrocketing.

549
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:48,598
Rym: Actually, no, it goes way back.

550
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,380
Rym: So things of the day, because portals are popular lately, I can't imagine why.

551
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,920
Scott: Yeah, we spent a lot of time in that first half.

552
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,360
Rym: Someone made a Flash game, it's Tetris, you know, regular Tetris with portals.

553
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,959
Rym: It's actually pretty good, I think you should try it out.

554
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,380
Scott: I will try it out, I somehow didn't see this on the internet.

555
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,940
Rym: I'm surprised that you didn't see it, which means that you don't actually know how it works.

556
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,417
Rym: You're speculating now as to where the portals are used and when you see it, you'll be like,

557
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:19,478
Rym: "Oh!"

558
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,899
Rym: I'm sure they're used on the walls of the Tetris area.

559
00:32:23,504 --> 00:32:23,979
Rym: They're used.

560
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:25,042
Scott: Okay.

561
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:29,640
Scott: Do you know about Tiffen Boxes?

562
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,020
Rym: See, it's funny, it must be Synchronicity because Emily was telling me about Tiffen Boxes just the other day.

563
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,800
Scott: Maybe she was reading the same article on the internet that I was reading.

564
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:38,939
Rym: I believe she was.

565
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,465
Scott: Probably that would make sense, right?

566
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:44,160
Scott: I mean, oh, Synchronicity, we both read an article on the internet the same day.

567
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:46,415
Scott: And we both talked about it separately.

568
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:47,000
Scott: Gasp.

569
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,300
Scott: It must be Psychic Powers, not reading the same article in the same, you know.

570
00:32:53,381 --> 00:33:01,540
Scott: Anyway, it was weird actually because I was biking to work today and I saw a truck called Tiffen NYC that provides this service in New York.

571
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,992
Scott: I was like, "Whoa, that's

572
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:03,660
Scott: coincidence.".

573
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,119
Rym: I want them to deliver me a Tiffen.

574
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:06,318
Scott: You can, you can sign up.

575
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,519
Scott: So here's basically the deal, right?

576
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:13,520
Scott: In India, specifically Mumbai, but I'm sure in other places, people want lunch at work.

577
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:14,760
Scott: You like lunch at work, right?

578
00:33:14,981 --> 00:33:16,179
Scott: That's like best part of the day.

579
00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:19,680
Scott: But they don't want to go out and buy lunch because that's expensive.

580
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:26,700
Scott: And at the same time, they don't want to eat shitty, you know, fast food or something, right?

581
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,939
Scott: They want home cooked food.

582
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:35,900
Scott: Now you could home cook some food and bring it to work on your own, but then it might get cold and you have to reheat it or whatever, right?

583
00:33:36,761 --> 00:33:48,620
Scott: So what they have is they have this service where basically these people will go to your house, get the food that somebody cooked for you at your house, and bring it to you at your desk at work.

584
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,500
Rym: So that is for people who have a chef.

585
00:33:53,104 --> 00:33:53,854
Scott: They deliver, right?

586
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,520
Scott: There are 4,000 dabawalas, which are the name for the delivery people.

587
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,400
Rym: I'm pretty sure I could just tell my butler to drive the stupid food to my office.

588
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:05,811
Scott: The 4,000 dabawalas deliver 160,000 home cooked lunches, right?

589
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:15,918
Scott: They're cooked by suburban wives and they deliver them to, or mothers, and they deliver them to the office workers every single day, right?

590
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:21,129
Scott: And the percentage of correctness of delivery is 99.79% correct delivery.

591
00:34:26,161 --> 00:34:35,900
Scott: So they almost never fail to deliver, even though most of the delivery people are illiterate and they have some sort of system of marking the delivery tins so that they know where they go.

592
00:34:36,963 --> 00:34:37,920
Rym: That's really interesting.

593
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,800
Scott: Yeah, it's actually quite fascinating.

594
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:45,380
Scott: There's a whole video about it and there's a description of how to read the delivery markings and what they mean.

595
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:57,260
Scott: Basically, they take the trains and then at the train station, they split them up and sometimes your food might pass through three or four delivery guys' hands before it gets to the place that it's going.

596
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,480
Scott: But it shows up at your desk guaranteed and basically, why don't you bring your lunch to work?

597
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,034
Scott: Well, because someone will be like, "Oh, I guess you can't afford the delivery

598
00:35:06,054 --> 00:35:06,275
Scott: guys.".

599
00:35:07,864 --> 00:35:08,736
Scott: It's that sort of thing.

600
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:16,080
Scott: But actually, what I think is cool, it's like I don't have anyone at home to cook me food to have it delivered to work.

601
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,460
Scott: And if I'm going to cook it before I leave work, I might as well just bring it with me and use the microwave at work.

602
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:35,700
Scott: But you can buy, for actually a ridiculously high price in the United States, the Tiffin boxes so that you could put food in it and bring it to work, which actually is a lot more efficient looking to me than the Bento box and holds a lot more food.

603
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,620
Scott: Because it's basically a stack of, you know, tins that all stack up and seal all together.

604
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,120
Scott: So you can have a bunch of different courses that are all completely separate from each other.

605
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:50,820
Scott: So you can have like the curry in one tin and rice in another tin and meat and some, you know, what's it called?

606
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:53,199
Scott: The potato triangles.

607
00:35:55,424 --> 00:35:56,900
Scott: Why am I not remembering this word?

608
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,400
Rym: So, in the meta moment.

609
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:01,860
Scott: In another tin, right.

610
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:03,949
Rym: This weekend is the Nerdnik.

611
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,520
Rym: We'll be at the Nerdnik, do nerding and nicking.

612
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,880
Scott: It's Central Park on Saturday.

613
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,880
Rym: Yep, I don't know what kind of games we'll play other than things like Jungle Speed and Spotted and Tag and Football.

614
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,239
Rym: And... You know, games you can play in the wind.

615
00:36:18,482 --> 00:36:18,736
Rym: UFC.

616
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,640
Rym: On the grass.

617
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:21,211
Scott: Yeah, just go to NerdNYC.com.

618
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,480
Rym: Yep, next weekend is the NerdNYC board game night.

619
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,760
Rym: There's also a nerd night, which is completely unrelated.

620
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,420
Rym: We might be at, we'll either be at the board game night or we'll be at the nerd night doing a presentation.

621
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:33,920
Rym: Oh really?

622
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:35,539
Scott: I didn't know about this.

623
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,580
Rym: I'm sorting all that out presently.

624
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:38,160
Rym: Alright.

625
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,840
Rym: So stay tuned, we'll post a news update.

626
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,960
Rym: I know we've been lacking in the news updates because both of us forget to post them.

627
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,800
Rym: So we're gonna start posting the news more often.

628
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,020
Scott: I also want to remind people about BarCamp NYC.

629
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,871
Rym: Yep, Scott's a big part of that.

630
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:51,760
Rym: It looks like it's a lot of fun.

631
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,840
Rym: If you don't know what BarCamp is, it's nerdy and about computers.

632
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,419
Scott: Just go on the internet and you'll find out.

633
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,000
Rym: You know, FUBAR, yeah.

634
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:02,020
Scott: You can still register for it.

635
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,356
Scott: It's gonna be Saturday, May 21st and Sunday, May 22nd.

636
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,798
Scott: But you know what's really rough?

637
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,796
Scott: This is gonna be rough for me because Friday, May 20th at night.

638
00:37:11,301 --> 00:37:13,460
Rym: Oh right, you got into Jane McGonigal's game.

639
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:15,739
Scott: I'm gonna be in the New York Public Library.

640
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:19,520
Rym: I'm really jealous because I really wanted to be a part of that.

641
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,264
Scott: 7.45, well from 7pm to 6am.

642
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:31,500
Scott: So I'm gonna be in the library for 13 hours and then at 9am, well probably immediately after the library, I'm gonna go over to the Microsoft offices for BarCamp.

643
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,960
Rym: You're gonna find the future.

644
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,279
Scott: There's gonna be no sleep.

645
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,769
Rym: Till Brooklyn.

646
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:37,758
Rym: Well, till Queens.

647
00:37:39,062 --> 00:37:40,960
Scott: Which is gonna be Saturday night.

648
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,000
Scott: And then I have to go back to BarCamp Sunday morning.

649
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,840
Rym: The Book Club book is Foundation, which every nerd should read.

650
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,460
Rym: And we, being two nerds who have not read it, are rectifying this.

651
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,739
Scott: As soon as I finish re-reading Prince of Nothing, which you should all do.

652
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,300
Rym: Oh my god, you should all re-read The Prince of Nothing.

653
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,166
Scott: All five books.

654
00:37:56,206 --> 00:37:57,559
Scott: now, the fifth book just came out.

655
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,400
Rym: And I got, this is really important.

656
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:07,980
Rym: If you were reading The Prince of Nothing and weren't reading the next set of books, because our Scott Bakker has a tendency to end every goddamn book on a cliffhanger.

657
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,840
Scott: He is like Urasawa's Canadian spirit.

658
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,520
Rym: The fourth book has the worst cliffhanger I've seen since Escaflowna.

659
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,260
Scott: That's why I have yet to read the fourth book.

660
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,733
Scott: Because I knew that.

661
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,520
Rym: Well, I'm sure glad we survived that.

662
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:24,553
Rym: Hey, by god, is that her ratio?

663
00:38:24,574 --> 00:38:25,719
Rym: Bowing toward us?

664
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,897
Scott: The end, no epilogue.

665
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,460
Rym: The fifth book is not really a cliffhanger.

666
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,599
Rym: It ends at a point that was good.

667
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,680
Rym: And I am not going to be chomping at the bit for the next two books.

668
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,499
Scott: That is why I have waited until now.

669
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,380
Scott: I'm gonna re-read the first three to get it all fresh in the mind.

670
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,380
Scott: To make sure I have a good handle on all the proper nouns.

671
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:44,642
Scott: Right?

672
00:38:44,703 --> 00:38:46,159
Scott: And I know who Inri Sejness is.

673
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:49,098
Scott: And then, I'm gonna read those second two, right?

674
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,520
Scott: Because I bought a soft cover of number four.

675
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,100
Scott: And I'm gonna read your hard cover of five so I don't have to buy a hard cover book.

676
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:55,700
Scott: I hate reading hard cover books.

677
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,519
Scott: I'll buy the soft cover one when it comes out.

678
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:01,516
Scott: And then, once I finish reading all five, we're gonna do a Thursday episode.

679
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:02,400
Scott: that's not book club.

680
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:03,559
Rym: Oh my god, we're going to.

681
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,500
Scott: And we're gonna do Prince of Nothing again.

682
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,560
Scott: And we're gonna do it again when more books come out every time.

683
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,840
Scott: Because it's our favorite book.

684
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,484
Rym: Seriously?

685
00:39:10,504 --> 00:39:12,460
Rym: The Prince of Nothing, the first book?

686
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,050
Rym: I mean, it's not Shakespeare, right?

687
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,900
Scott: But it's FRC book series number one.

688
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,118
Scott: So, I mean, come on.

689
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,839
Rym: Yeah, these are some good books.

690
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,116
Rym: And reading the last one again, I'm reading and I'm like, "Oh right, these

691
00:39:24,217 --> 00:39:24,559
Rym: books!".

692
00:39:24,902 --> 00:39:25,980
Scott: Oh right, Heron Spear.

693
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,299
Rym: Says Watha.

694
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,180
Rym: Heron Spear?

695
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:29,451
Rym: Oh my god, the Heron Spear.

696
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:30,359
Rym: I still don't know what it is.

697
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:31,939
Scott: They're not supposed to know.

698
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:37,280
Scott: I bet it's a spear and it has at least one feather on it from a heron.

699
00:39:37,381 --> 00:39:37,838
Scott: That's my guess.

700
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,939
Rym: The whole time I'm reading the fifth book, Scott is like, "Has anyone been raped

701
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:42,120
Rym: yet?".

702
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:43,079
Rym: And I kept saying no.

703
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:44,720
Scott: I didn't ask you if anyone was raped.

704
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,320
Scott: You actually went out of your way.

705
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,670
Rym: You asked me at one point.

706
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,537
Rym: You're like, "Any

707
00:39:48,578 --> 00:39:48,739
Rym: rape?".

708
00:39:48,942 --> 00:39:49,940
Scott: I did not ask you that.

709
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,178
Scott: Yes, you did.

710
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,956
Scott: I asked you that after you had already been being like, you know, "Hey, there's no rapes

711
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:55,217
Scott: yet.".

712
00:39:56,172 --> 00:39:56,320
Rym: Anyway.

713
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:57,320
Scott: You specifically went out of your way.

714
00:39:58,106 --> 00:39:59,540
Rym: So, yeah, eventually there was raping.

715
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,660
Scott: Rym has rape on the book.

716
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,138
Rym: It happened.

717
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,900
Scott: I mean, there's rape right away in book one, so it's not like...

718
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:09,840
Rym: One of our friends had never heard of Abraham Lincoln, and because we were talking about our Scott Becker, he came up the other day.

719
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,140
Rym: But anyway, I think that's all the meta we got.

720
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:14,641
Scott: Portal 2!

721
00:40:14,641 --> 00:40:15,380
Rym: Portal 2!

722
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,500
Scott: Good God, this show's gonna be long.

723
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,080
Rym: Let's keep it long, though.

724
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,480
Rym: You've been listening for 40 minutes, waiting for Portal.

725
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:20,936
Rym: You know what?

726
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:22,380
Rym: It's a Portal game.

727
00:40:22,701 --> 00:40:26,100
Rym: If you like Portal 1, you will like Portal 2 the same amount.

728
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,580
Rym: If you hated Portal 1, you will fucking hate Portal 2.

729
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,300
Scott: Who hates Portal 1?

730
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,240
Rym: People with really, really bad spatial, conceptual brain powers.

731
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:39,521
Scott: Alright, now, Portal 2... Let's compare and contrast with Portal 1.

732
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,400
Rym: Alright, Portal 1, I think, had better puzzles.

733
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:43,777
Scott: Yes and no.

734
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:48,300
Rym: They were better because they were slightly... They were very well-polished.

735
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:50,560
Scott: Well, they've been well-polished in both.

736
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:57,280
Rym: Portal was one of the most tightly and beautifully and well-designed games I've ever seen.

737
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:08,260
Rym: The people who work at Valve on games like Half-Life and Portal are probably the only people in the entire game industry who, if I were presented to them, would have almost no criticism for.

738
00:41:08,845 --> 00:41:10,360
Rym: In fact, basically no criticism.

739
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,480
Rym: That's legitimate.

740
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,239
Scott: Yeah, I mean, their networking works.

741
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:17,280
Scott: I mean... You wanna play Counter-Strike?

742
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,640
Scott: Guess what?

743
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:17,978
Scott: It works.

744
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:24,298
Rym: Yeah, but we do a panel on game theory, and unnamed developers from Blizzard are like, "Yeah, you guys think about this way more than we

745
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:24,439
Rym: do.".

746
00:41:24,961 --> 00:41:29,019
Rym: And then, I imagine the Valve field will be like, "Yeah, your math was all wrong, and we actually, you do it this

747
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:29,240
Rym: way.".

748
00:41:30,181 --> 00:41:36,080
Scott: I don't know, but they might do it the same way as the Blizzard people by trial and error, but like the Blizzard people, they succeed in getting it right.

749
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:38,716
Scott: Whether their methods are inductive or deductive.

750
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:51,300
Rym: Anyway, I feel like in Portal 1, the puzzles, because the game was new and I didn't know what to expect, the puzzles were more difficult and there were more red herrings.

751
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:58,400
Rym: There were more places to throw portals, so there were a lot of wrong directions you could go in trying to solve something.

752
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:05,560
Rym: Even though the design of the puzzles was such that if you looked around, it was obvious, because they did a really good job of highlighting what to look at.

753
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,489
Rym: Portal 2 was almost too perfect.

754
00:42:09,689 --> 00:42:13,620
Rym: I basically didn't think at all throughout the vast majority of the puzzle.

755
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,559
Scott: Did you do the whole co-op?

756
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:15,678
Rym: I didn't do the co-op yet.

757
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,687
Scott: In the co-op, there's a couple places where we had to think, right?

758
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:24,640
Scott: Because usually one or the other one of us would figure out the solution, and then you'd have to team up to execute it.

759
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,580
Scott: So it pretty much, it's like, one of you is going to solve it somehow, and then you're going to discuss the execution and then do it.

760
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:36,820
Scott: But there were a couple where we stood around for a while and felt stupid when we figured it out.

761
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,620
Rym: See, I haven't played the co-op yet, so I can't really talk about that.

762
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:41,146
Scott: The co-op is so important, though.

763
00:42:41,307 --> 00:42:44,120
Scott: I'd say it's the most important part of the game.

764
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,973
Rym: Oh, I really want to play the co-op.

765
00:42:46,034 --> 00:42:46,819
Rym: I'm going to.

766
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:56,500
Rym: But the puzzles, because they were so streamlined, there were almost no red herrings and very few places to throw a portal that were completely useless.

767
00:42:56,802 --> 00:42:58,712
Scott: Yes, I was listening to the commentary.

768
00:42:58,732 --> 00:43:00,160
Scott: I'm about halfway through the commentary.

769
00:43:00,941 --> 00:43:06,480
Scott: I'm going to try to just watch the rest of the commentary on YouTube or something like that, because it's sort of annoying to have to play the whole game again.

770
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:13,540
Scott: But anyway, the one thing in the commentary is like, you notice, they talk about it a lot, is there's this huge balancing act that goes on, right?

771
00:43:14,784 --> 00:43:18,819
Scott: They want the player to learn gradually, which they do a very good job at, right?

772
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,160
Scott: A very good job of teaching you different concepts in the game one at a time.

773
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,905
Scott: It's like, here's how to use a portal.

774
00:43:25,386 --> 00:43:26,389
Scott: Here's how to use a cube.

775
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:27,693
Scott: Here's how to use a button.

776
00:43:27,974 --> 00:43:30,040
Scott: Here's how to use a cube and a button and a portal together.

777
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,124
Scott: Here's how to do a jump.

778
00:43:31,164 --> 00:43:34,500
Scott: And they teach you the rules of the game very slowly and gradually.

779
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:36,108
Scott: It's a good learning curve.

780
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,133
Scott: Excellent job.

781
00:43:37,173 --> 00:43:38,380
Scott: They never messed that up, right?

782
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:42,820
Scott: But what they do is they have so much playtesting, apparently, right?

783
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:51,120
Scott: And they want to make the puzzles such that they get increasingly more difficult while introducing new elements.

784
00:43:51,602 --> 00:43:54,113
Scott: But they don't want to make them difficult in the wrong way.

785
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:55,700
Scott: They're going for the Super Meat Boy, right?

786
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,977
Rym: They don't want, like, "Oh, I didn't realize that was a

787
00:43:59,037 --> 00:43:59,319
Rym: button.".

788
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,162
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

789
00:44:00,223 --> 00:44:05,480
Scott: Like, there is one puzzle, actually, where they, I think, is probably, you know, it's such a tiny thing.

790
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,460
Scott: And it's probably the only puzzle that could be improved, visually, design-wise.

791
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,119
Rym: Which one is this?

792
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,340
Scott: There's one where there's a button that you sort of don't see if you don't look in the right area.

793
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:16,511
Scott: And it's like you have to jump up and hit a button.

794
00:44:16,872 --> 00:44:18,340
Scott: And you won't see it because it's like in a corner.

795
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,300
Rym: Oh, I saw that button, like, right away.

796
00:44:20,803 --> 00:44:23,820
Scott: Yeah, but, like, some people, like, I didn't see it for about 30 seconds.

797
00:44:24,422 --> 00:44:26,220
Scott: And some other people didn't see it for, like, minutes.

798
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,251
Rym: Well, I see where you're going.

799
00:44:27,271 --> 00:44:27,900
Rym: I think I agree.

800
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:34,480
Scott: So it's like what they don't want to make it hard to solve just by being obtuse or, you know, obfuscated.

801
00:44:34,821 --> 00:44:36,760
Scott: They want to make it hard to solve by solving.

802
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:45,280
Scott: But if you don't make it hard to solve by obfuscating, then it becomes really hard to make something that is hard, right?

803
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,485
Rym: And that's my problem.

804
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:50,160
Rym: I brute-forced every puzzle, almost every puzzle, by not even thinking.

805
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,284
Rym: Here's my process.

806
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:53,614
Rym: I go into a room, I look at all the places.

807
00:44:53,674 --> 00:44:55,080
Rym: I can throw portals that are angled.

808
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:55,862
Scott: Yep.

809
00:44:56,085 --> 00:44:57,440
Scott: And you know that you're going to jump out of those.

810
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,378
Rym: And then later when there's goop, I also think, "Do I want to put a portal there or goop

811
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:01,579
Rym: there?".

812
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,422
Rym: And you know what?

813
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:07,320
Rym: I put goop everywhere I could, except the one place where you can put it fucking everywhere and it doesn't matter.

814
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:07,506
Rym: Yep.

815
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,040
Rym: Because that always solved by brute force.

816
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:16,700
Rym: If there's any place where an angle thing goes toward a place where I can get goop, I wouldn't even look at what was on the other side.

817
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:23,740
Rym: I would just blindly put the goop, throw the portal, jump through it, because every jump was guaranteed to get me where I wanted to be.

818
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,040
Scott: Or at least somewhere different that you hadn't been before.

819
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,260
Rym: That I had to get to to solve it.

820
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,679
Scott: Unless you've already taken that jump.

821
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,480
Rym: I could assume that any jump would take me exactly where I needed to go.

822
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:33,903
Scott: Right.

823
00:45:33,923 --> 00:45:34,699
Scott: And what were they going to do?

824
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:41,480
Scott: If they would have put in extra angled surfaces that went to places you didn't want to go, then it would basically just be obtuse.

825
00:45:41,721 --> 00:45:44,995
Scott: You would go somewhere and then it would be like, "Oh derp, there's no reason to go over here.

826
00:45:45,015 --> 00:45:45,497
Scott: It's just a red

827
00:45:45,517 --> 00:45:45,839
Scott: herring.".

828
00:45:46,181 --> 00:45:47,190
Scott: And that doesn't make it harder.

829
00:45:47,231 --> 00:45:48,200
Scott: That just makes it annoying.

830
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,240
Rym: But at the same time, because there are no red herrings, I didn't have to think.

831
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:57,780
Rym: As soon as I saw any way to combine two elements together, that seems to be the secret.

832
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:01,860
Rym: Any two elements, if you can combine them together, is guaranteed to be the solution.

833
00:46:02,163 --> 00:46:03,940
Rym: So I've got goop and an angled surface.

834
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,519
Rym: Alright, I'll go through the angled surface on a portal, hit the goop, it'll bounce me where I need to go.

835
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:08,887
Rym: Button and a cube.

836
00:46:09,089 --> 00:46:10,020
Rym: Cube's going on the button.

837
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,600
Scott: That's right.

838
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,140
Rym: As soon as two elements link up, it just works.

839
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:22,680
Rym: And too many of the puzzles also, because even if they had multiple steps, they made it really hard to go to the wrong area.

840
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:27,760
Rym: So as a result, you would never have to actually figure out the order of the steps.

841
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,289
Rym: It was always the direct route.

842
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:31,020
Rym: You didn't have to do anything tricky.

843
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:38,880
Scott: Yeah, there were some puzzles in Portal 1, maybe a couple of them, where you could actually go to the next room.

844
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:44,300
Scott: But you couldn't actually do anything to progress in that room because you hadn't done the previous room.

845
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,255
Rym: Or you could get all the way to the end and then realize, "Oh, I didn't do a cube

846
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:48,416
Rym: thing.".

847
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,080
Scott: Right, but in Portal 2, there was no way to get to the next area until you had already solved the first part.

848
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,279
Scott: So they broke it into chunks.

849
00:46:56,741 --> 00:47:02,020
Scott: So it's like they made the user -- it's like if you were trying to make -- think about making an operating system.

850
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,080
Scott: You're making a user interface.

851
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,320
Scott: So you design -- you have the best user interface design in the world.

852
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,215
Scott: So anyone who wants to do something, it's like, "Oh, I want to burn a CD.

853
00:47:09,316 --> 00:47:09,658
Scott: Oh, that was

854
00:47:09,718 --> 00:47:09,899
Scott: easy.".

855
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:11,052
Scott: "I want to visit a website.

856
00:47:11,092 --> 00:47:11,335
Scott: That was

857
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:11,598
Scott: easy.".

858
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,000
Scott: And just everything is so obvious, it's like the best user interface known to man.

859
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,859
Scott: But then you want to make it challenging.

860
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:21,380
Scott: How do you make it challenging but also make it good design at the same time?

861
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,008
Scott: And that is the fundamental thing in Portal.

862
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:27,620
Scott: is that you want -- how do you make it harder without making it bad design?

863
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,500
Rym: Now luckily, you know, it sounds like we're scathingly reviewing the game as being too easy.

864
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,551
Rym: Oh, it was so fun.

865
00:47:33,692 --> 00:47:34,239
Scott: It was so fun.

866
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:37,800
Scott: I want more friggin' chambers so badly.

867
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,720
Rym: This is a situation of, you know, that's the only criticism we have.

868
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,400
Scott: Yeah, the game makes you -- it's weird because it's like the game makes you feel smart, right?

869
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:54,158
Scott: But it's like the fact that they make the Portal, you know, the puzzles intentionally not hard, it's sort of like, "No, you're really not so

870
00:47:54,178 --> 00:47:54,340
Scott: smart.".

871
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,560
Rym: Well, here's one final complaint.

872
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,300
Rym: And this is actually something that is weird because in Portal 1 there was more of this.

873
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,100
Rym: And I remember being frustrated because it was very difficult in some places.

874
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,380
Rym: But in Portal 2 they removed it and I was more frustrated that it was gone.

875
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,853
Rym: Execution doesn't matter for 99% of the puzzles.

876
00:48:12,241 --> 00:48:16,560
Rym: You have infinite time, you just sit there like, "Portal, Portal, Portal," do your thing.

877
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:18,533
Rym: Figuring it out is 90% of the battle.

878
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,380
Rym: There are very few times you had to shoot a Portal mid-air and then change Portals after you pop through.

879
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:33,939
Rym: And many puzzles, while you didn't need to do that, because I guess I'm good at FPSs, I skipped a number of Portal puzzles.

880
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:35,420
Scott: With execution skill?

881
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,520
Rym: Just by using execution skill and making a loop where I'd fall from the sky into a pit.

882
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:43,800
Rym: And I'd just do this a bunch and then I'd bounce off of something and fly off across everything.

883
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:48,440
Scott: The co-op actually has a lot of execution-type puzzles.

884
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,720
Rym: I rescind my criticism.

885
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:57,800
Scott: For example, there's one where one person has to go basically onto this moving platform behind a wall of glass, right?

886
00:48:58,261 --> 00:49:02,340
Scott: And the other person has to step on buttons to basically play Gyromite.

887
00:49:03,088 --> 00:49:03,520
Scott: Oh man.

888
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,460
Scott: And if you fail at the Gyromite, spiky death for the other guy.

889
00:49:06,827 --> 00:49:07,075
Scott: Oh man.

890
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:12,520
Scott: And you have to do the timing of the button pressing to save the other guy from Gyromite, spiky death.

891
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,700
Scott: So that's just one example of the kind of execution puzzles that exist in co-op.

892
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:22,840
Scott: Another example of execution in co-op, a lot of times you have to do something simultaneously with the other guy, with timing.

893
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:30,699
Scott: And it's like, so you'll... The game lets you display a timer on the screen that'll count down for both of you at the same time.

894
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,876
Scott: So it'll be like three, two, one.

895
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,460
Scott: And then you both hit the buttons and go into your Portals.

896
00:49:35,842 --> 00:49:38,420
Scott: And you have to do something at the same time to make it work.

897
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,876
Scott: So there is a lot of that sort of Evangelion episode, DDR stuff.

898
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,540
Rym: Ah, that's a good episode and a good reference.

899
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:54,900
Rym: But along these lines, the portions in between chambers where there's plot going on, like Wheatley's yelling at you or something, were a little too railed.

900
00:49:55,881 --> 00:50:04,680
Rym: In that, in Portal 1, once you got behind the scenes, there was really a lot of leeway and a lot of very tricky execution toward the end.

901
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,720
Rym: So Portal 2, those were actually the easiest parts of the game.

902
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,700
Rym: Because if you see a wide surface, you shoot a fucking Portal at it, it's almost guaranteed to be the answer.

903
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,700
Scott: Yeah, because they only had one place that you could actually go.

904
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,040
Rym: Yeah, you couldn't jump on the rails.

905
00:50:16,321 --> 00:50:19,100
Scott: Well that is one thing, atmospherically, right?

906
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,540
Scott: It's like Portal 2 had the same kind of humor as Portal 1, right?

907
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:34,460
Scott: But the addition of the Wheatley character took away, while the humor was the same, and was, you know, excellently written and voice acted and executed and all that, right?

908
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,960
Scott: The atmosphere was different because you weren't alone with GLaDOS.

909
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,040
Scott: It was much noisier.

910
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:45,090
Rym: Only in some areas.

911
00:50:45,131 --> 00:50:46,320
Rym: I would have noticed, I mean, remember?

912
00:50:46,661 --> 00:50:49,779
Scott: No, because when Wheatley goes away, Cave Johnson comes in.

913
00:50:50,202 --> 00:50:51,580
Rym: No, but he's not there that often.

914
00:50:51,742 --> 00:50:52,280
Rym: He's there a lot.

915
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:53,000
Rym: And he's not interacting.

916
00:50:53,903 --> 00:50:55,800
Rym: Alright, I guess at this point we're at the spoiler line.

917
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,353
Rym: So, if you have not yet played Portal 2, play it.

918
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,099
Rym: And if you haven't played Portal 1, play it.

919
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:04,059
Scott: It's not really, I mean, it's not really spoilable.

920
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,619
Rym: I'll warn people, because I'm going to spoil a few things.

921
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:12,359
Rym: And, you know, I understand that a spoiler can affect someone's enjoyment of something, even though it's not, anyway.

922
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:14,060
Rym: We're going to spoil shit.

923
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,653
Rym: So if you haven't played the game, one, what are you doing?

924
00:51:15,693 --> 00:51:16,460
Rym: listening to GeekNights?

925
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,100
Rym: Portal's way more fun than GeekNights.

926
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,999
Scott: Maybe they're doing it at the same time.

927
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:33,000
Rym: So, there was, because in this game there was the Wheatley part of the game, and the GLaDOS part of the game, the End part of the game, and the Cave Johnson part of the game, and they all had very different atmospheres.

928
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:34,685
Rym: And I liked that.

929
00:51:34,745 --> 00:51:37,480
Rym: I liked that the atmosphere was different in all these areas.

930
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:44,720
Rym: Because Portal 1 was really one atmosphere halfway through, and then the back of that atmosphere for the other half.

931
00:51:45,601 --> 00:51:48,260
Rym: So I'm glad they did something different, just because it was something different.

932
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,200
Rym: And I think one of the primary, like, the game itself is really good, but I wouldn't enjoy it nearly as much.

933
00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:00,640
Rym: I would say a good third of the enjoyment of Portal is just the fact that it is really well written, and really immersive, and really fucking funny.

934
00:52:01,343 --> 00:52:03,260
Scott: You know, it's funny, but it's not that funny.

935
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,740
Rym: I was laughing out loud during pretty much the entirety of the Cave Johnson era.

936
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:11,240
Scott: I think ponies are about twice as funny as Portal 2.

937
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:16,496
Rym: When Cave Johnson is just arguing, he's like, "Yeah, but don't worry, you're not in the control group.

938
00:52:16,696 --> 00:52:17,579
Rym: Those guys broke all their

939
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:17,839
Rym: legs.".

940
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:22,520
Rym: I'm being told by the scientists that I shouldn't have told you that you're not in the control group.

941
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,083
Rym: What do they know?

942
00:52:23,123 --> 00:52:25,480
Rym: I found that stuff to be hilarious.

943
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,616
Scott: Yeah, you know, it got me a slight chuckle.

944
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,560
Rym: Did you find all the doors, like the secret area with all the extra doors of all the vitrified experiments?

945
00:52:34,181 --> 00:52:38,480
Scott: I looked around a little bit, but I didn't spend the time to actually look in every single nook and cranny.

946
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:38,842
Rym: It was trivial.

947
00:52:38,862 --> 00:52:42,380
Rym: There's one office, right, where there's a door hidden half behind a bunch of computers.

948
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:44,799
Rym: And back there, there's a whole bunch of doors.

949
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,660
Rym: And every door has the audio of whatever experiment, like "Turn your blood into peanut oil" was back there.

950
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:51,620
Scott: Oh, I didn't go back there, no.

951
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,144
Rym: Oh, really?

952
00:52:52,245 --> 00:52:53,320
Rym: You should have gone back there.

953
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,220
Rym: You also, apparently, we were talking before the show, didn't find the dry dock to the Borealis.

954
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,263
Scott: No, I didn't either.

955
00:52:59,283 --> 00:53:02,820
Scott: But I remembered the Borealis from Half-Life 2, but I didn't find it in Portal 2.

956
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,620
Rym: You didn't find the turrets practicing their song.

957
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,265
Scott: Well, look, the turrets singing, right?

958
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:08,249
Scott: I found this.

959
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:11,700
Scott: I knew that in that chamber, there's one turret behind a grating.

960
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:13,371
Scott: And I'm like, "There's something back there.

961
00:53:13,613 --> 00:53:14,479
Scott: I know there's something back

962
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:14,620
Scott: there.".

963
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,163
Scott: And I tried.

964
00:53:15,183 --> 00:53:15,987
Scott: I was like, "Poke, poke.

965
00:53:16,509 --> 00:53:17,173
Scott: Poke, poke, poke.

966
00:53:18,017 --> 00:53:18,359
Scott: Egg.".

967
00:53:18,379 --> 00:53:18,660
Scott: Whatever.

968
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,279
Scott: And I basically gave up and kept going.

969
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,299
Rym: You know how I got back there?

970
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:23,160
Rym: You kept poking?

971
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,160
Rym: No, there's a laser in that area, too, right?

972
00:53:26,962 --> 00:53:30,020
Rym: I angled the laser in and blew up the turret, and it blew the grating off.

973
00:53:30,844 --> 00:53:31,679
Scott: Oh, son of a bitch.

974
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,460
Rym: And then I went in there and there's the turret singing.

975
00:53:33,761 --> 00:53:37,680
Scott: I tried to poke and look around behind the turret to see if there was a portable surface.

976
00:53:38,322 --> 00:53:43,120
Rym: The other easter egg area was the one place where the containment field's busted.

977
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,258
Scott: Yeah, I did that.

978
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,391
Rym: Yeah, I walked through and it's like, "The containment field is

979
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:46,753
Rym: broken.".

980
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:47,979
Rym: And I stop, and I'm like...

981
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,033
Scott: And you see a portable wall right there, and you're like, "I'm going to get the

982
00:53:51,053 --> 00:53:51,133
Scott: cube.".

983
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,680
Rym: I didn't notice the portable wall.

984
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,558
Scott: So you went all the way back, and you were like, "Oh shit, I gotta do the puzzle

985
00:53:57,598 --> 00:53:57,799
Scott: again?".

986
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:04,479
Rym: No, so I went back, and I basically looped and looped and looped to jump over there with the cube.

987
00:54:05,564 --> 00:54:06,720
Scott: You could've just brought the cube up.

988
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,780
Rym: And I did all this work.

989
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,319
Scott: If you had just made a portal before you went down, you could've just grabbed the cube.

990
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,820
Rym: So I do this crazy, bullshit, tactical execution shenanigans.

991
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,257
Rym: I get the cube through, and then as I walk in, I see the wall, and I'm like, "Oh,

992
00:54:19,498 --> 00:54:19,658
Rym: wow.".

993
00:54:20,684 --> 00:54:23,300
Scott: The thing is, you have to make a wall before you jump down.

994
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,320
Scott: I almost jump down without making the portal first, in which case you have to solve the puzzle again.

995
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:30,340
Rym: I did that a couple of times later in the game.

996
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:35,780
Rym: I think my favorite puzzles were the ones involving the goop and the tractor beams.

997
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:37,589
Scott: I like that.

998
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:38,920
Rym: you can put the goop in the tractor beams.

999
00:54:39,282 --> 00:54:41,900
Scott: The tractor beams are called extrusion funnels.

1000
00:54:42,563 --> 00:54:44,779
Scott: I actually like the bridges the most.

1001
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:50,059
Rym: Especially when you can put them sideways and block turrets, or knock turrets over.

1002
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:57,640
Scott: The thing is, I wish that they would've gotten... First of all, did you notice in Portal 1, there were the energy balls?

1003
00:54:58,143 --> 00:54:59,881
Scott: The energy balls are not present in Portal 2.

1004
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:01,580
Rym: I didn't like the energy balls.

1005
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,720
Scott: What's wrong with the energy ball?

1006
00:55:03,462 --> 00:55:10,860
Rym: They remind me very much of the puzzles you start to get about halfway through Lolo 3.

1007
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:17,420
Rym: Where they'd run out of good ideas, and the puzzles started to rely on fiddly execution of discrete things.

1008
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,220
Rym: There's a thing that's moving around, and you have to also interact with that.

1009
00:55:21,542 --> 00:55:24,720
Scott: The energy ball is very functionally similar to the laser.

1010
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:29,020
Scott: But it is subtly different from the laser, in that there's just one energy ball.

1011
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:36,960
Rym: But the laser, by being consistent, and being aligned, and especially with the way you can use the lenses, I think was a more elegant puzzle mechanism.

1012
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:42,320
Scott: The thing with the laser is that if you have a laser with a portal, you have to keep the portal open for the laser.

1013
00:55:43,181 --> 00:55:49,640
Scott: For the energy ball, you can get the energy ball into the place it's supposed to go, and then your portals are free again.

1014
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:52,157
Scott: You don't need to keep putting the energy ball back into its spot.

1015
00:55:52,197 --> 00:55:52,520
Scott: It's there.

1016
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,800
Rym: I guess with the extrusion funnels, I really enjoyed getting goop in places where they probably didn't expect me to get goop.

1017
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:06,358
Scott: No, I actually, from what I saw, is that they pretty well constructed the levels so that you couldn't really get goop anywhere.

1018
00:56:06,678 --> 00:56:07,520
Scott: that would sort of cheat.

1019
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:15,456
Scott: I'm sure the YouTube will prove me wrong, but from what I could tell, it was pretty tricky to get goop somewhere.

1020
00:56:15,476 --> 00:56:17,420
Scott: that would really break the level.

1021
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:26,358
Rym: Yeah, but when I got to the white goop, because they told you what the other two goops do, and you get to the white goop, and it's just coming out, and I'm looking at them like, "White goop, I wonder what this

1022
00:56:26,438 --> 00:56:26,920
Rym: does.".

1023
00:56:27,481 --> 00:56:38,500
Scott: Yeah, the white goop really, they put it in there because it was clever, but you really can't make any good puzzles with the white goop because basically once you get the white goop somewhere, you can get it everywhere.

1024
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,460
Rym: Nope, it depends entirely on the angle of attack from the white goop source.

1025
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,960
Rym: If the angle is such, then there are many places you could not get goop.

1026
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:55,260
Scott: But the thing is, when you get the white goop somewhere, you can get it almost everywhere, and if you can get the white goop almost everywhere, then you can solve whatever puzzle there is.

1027
00:56:55,380 --> 00:57:01,100
Rym: Notice how, as a result, there are only a few puzzles with the white goop, and they were actually probably the best puzzles you could make with the white goop.

1028
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,480
Scott: That was probably all the puzzles you could make with the white goop, that wouldn't just be stupid.

1029
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,120
Rym: Short of having much larger puzzles.

1030
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:23,260
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you could use a lot of gratings, because notice goop doesn't stick to a grating, to contain the white goop to certain areas, and then force someone to get the white goop to go through an extrusion funnel to a weird place on a bridge where the late, you know, you could do tricky stuff like that.

1031
00:57:24,123 --> 00:57:29,080
Rym: They have good puzzles with turning on and off the goop versus the funnels versus other stuff, too.

1032
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:38,060
Scott: Yeah, I wish, though, that they could have made, you know, something more complex, like, you know, the balls hard super meat boy kind of funnels, right?

1033
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:45,900
Scott: Because super meat boy manages to be balls hard in execution and combination of moves, right?

1034
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:52,020
Scott: And the portal, too, they get pretty far with combination of moves, but they don't actually go as far as you can get.

1035
00:57:52,281 --> 00:57:58,120
Scott: There's nothing that combines goop and lasers and funnels and bridges simultaneously, right?

1036
00:57:58,522 --> 00:58:00,480
Scott: There's nothing that does all of them at the same time.

1037
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:06,360
Scott: I think there's one part where you have to put goop on a bridge, and I think that's as complicated as it gets, right?

1038
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:11,700
Scott: But there's no goop on a bridge with a funnel and both colors of goop and a laser.

1039
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,751
Rym: Well, once you got orange goop, all the puzzles for a while were anytime.

1040
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:18,719
Rym: there's a long stretch, you're just gonna run into a portal.

1041
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:24,678
Scott: Well, I like the ones, actually, where you use orange goop and two portals to pick up speed in a very small area, right?

1042
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,485
Scott: Because that's pretty tricky.

1043
00:58:26,565 --> 00:58:36,700
Scott: And then, those happen more often in the co-op, because when you're going through, when you're picking up speed in a small area with the orange goop, you need somebody else to control the portals to launch you somewhere.

1044
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,798
Scott: You can't do it on your own.

1045
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,064
Rym: Of course, I got through a lot of puzzles.

1046
00:58:40,124 --> 00:58:45,900
Rym: by shooting a portal in between the two portals I was gaining up speed on in, like, the half a second you've got.

1047
00:58:46,221 --> 00:58:48,320
Scott: Yeah, I did a lot of that, too, where it wasn't necessary.

1048
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:55,615
Rym: I would walk through and, like, look and practice until I could snap my view to the exact spot I had to hit from the angle.

1049
00:58:55,695 --> 00:58:58,060
Rym: I would see it in through the portal.

1050
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:04,920
Scott: I would do a lot where you'd shoot a portal, you'd sort of poke halfway through it, and then you would shoot a portal while you're hanging out of the portal.

1051
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,499
Rym: Yup, and pop out, just like you shoot and pop.

1052
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,971
Scott: And then you pop backwards to end up where you just shot.

1053
00:59:09,534 --> 00:59:10,700
Scott: That's always a good trick.

1054
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:17,007
Rym: But, I don't know, story-wise, it picked up well.

1055
00:59:17,828 --> 00:59:27,119
Rym: It fit the continuity, except that unless you read that comic, there's a huge gap, and the comic is a little too literal of, "Oh, here's exactly what happened between the two

1056
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:27,520
Rym: games.".

1057
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,878
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

1058
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,460
Rym: But, did you read the comic?

1059
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,940
Scott: Yeah, I did read the comic, and the extras.

1060
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:35,889
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, the plot is the plot.

1061
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:37,774
Scott: It's not exactly the most exciting plot.

1062
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:39,799
Scott: It's just something, you know, to carry.

1063
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,180
Rym: I like the end where you're carrying GLaDOS on the potato, and I love how she hates that fucking bird.

1064
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:54,440
Rym: And I just love how Wheatley, he seems so nice until GLaDOS is kind of like, you realize what he is, right?

1065
00:59:54,645 --> 00:59:54,860
Scott: Yeah.

1066
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,277
Rym: And then after that, when he's like, "Oh, God, he's playing classical

1067
00:59:58,317 --> 00:59:58,679
Rym: music.".

1068
00:59:59,080 --> 00:59:59,301
Rym: Yeah.

1069
00:59:59,742 --> 01:00:03,171
Scott: But, you know, the thing is, the plot really itself is like, whatever.

1070
01:00:03,552 --> 01:00:05,437
Scott: You know, the Half-Life 2 plot, I care about.

1071
01:00:05,497 --> 01:00:06,800
Scott: The Portal 2 plot, I don't care.

1072
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,640
Scott: But, they intertwine, and they're going to, at least, if Half-Life 2 Episode 3 ever exists.

1073
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:11,400
Rym: Well, the Borealis.

1074
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,241
Scott: Exactly.

1075
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:15,671
Scott: If they ever come out with the next game, it'll intertwine.

1076
01:00:16,173 --> 01:00:18,540
Scott: But, the plot is basically just a vehicle.

1077
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:20,980
Rym: I wonder if Cave Johnson became the G-Man.

1078
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:25,820
Scott: Maybe, but all of the, you know, the plot is just a vehicle for all the jokes, right?

1079
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:35,220
Scott: It's like, you know, the real thing about the story that makes it entertaining is, you know, the potato and, you know, all the, you know, space.

1080
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:41,760
Scott: But, and the only, the plot is just something that they can attach all those things onto, right?

1081
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:45,993
Scott: The plot itself is, you know, sort of just like a train.

1082
01:00:46,033 --> 01:00:48,240
Scott: But, what really matters is the cargo on the train.

1083
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:48,581
Rym: Yup.

1084
01:00:48,961 --> 01:00:50,665
Rym: The end, I thought, was really touching.

1085
01:00:50,745 --> 01:00:57,240
Rym: Like, the ending movie, the whole, the only complaint I have about the very end is that the boss fight was a trivial joke.

1086
01:00:57,701 --> 01:00:58,999
Scott: The boss fight was a trivial joke.

1087
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,300
Rym: I just kind of, I walked around, no urgency.

1088
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:03,016
Scott: The Portal 1 boss fight actually was slightly hard.

1089
01:01:03,037 --> 01:01:03,600
Scott: You would die.

1090
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,081
Scott: Yeah.

1091
01:01:04,402 --> 01:01:06,350
Rym: It took me, like, three or four attempts to beat the Portal 1.

1092
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:08,779
Rym: Portal 2, I literally was like, dupe, dupe, dupe, dupe.

1093
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:16,200
Rym: I wish, instead of railroading you, where basically it lays you where you can't move, and then suddenly there's the moon up there.

1094
01:01:16,801 --> 01:01:23,380
Rym: I wish you had, in the course of the fight, blown up the ceiling and just had to fucking notice the moon and wonder if you could shoot a portal at it.

1095
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,459
Rym: I wish, I wish they'd made you figure that out instead of just giving it to you.

1096
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,006
Scott: I wish that they would have had an alternate ending, right?

1097
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:37,900
Scott: So, you know, by default, you know, it would just be you fight the thing and you smash it and then you get the ending.

1098
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:46,600
Scott: But, if you were clever and noticed the moon through the ceiling sometime during the fight, you could have gotten the secret ending that way.

1099
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,180
Scott: That would have been, that would have been cooler.

1100
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,820
Rym: That little bit at the end, while it's the, it is the cake is a lie of this game.

1101
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:53,682
Scott: Space!

1102
01:01:53,702 --> 01:01:55,400
Scott: I actually like space better than cake is a lie.

1103
01:01:55,662 --> 01:01:56,560
Rym: Space is really funny.

1104
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:58,018
Scott: Especially since it was foreshadowed.

1105
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:07,480
Rym: But it's just, I don't know, there's something about it, that little yellow guy who keeps coming by is like, the one time, I think it's the second time, he's like, we're in space, and Wheatley's like, I know, I know.

1106
01:02:07,801 --> 01:02:14,440
Scott: Yeah, in the commentary, they actually talked about how they were originally gonna have, uh, it wasn't gonna be just Wheatley, it was gonna be a whole bunch of different ones.

1107
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:30,680
Scott: But they couldn't find a way to actually introduce all of them to you and make it still stick, so they stuck with just Wheatley, and some of those, like the cowboy and the space guy, those guys were basically originally gonna have much more of a, you know, they were gonna, all these little balls would have had equal footing in the game.

1108
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,440
Scott: But they ended up just using Wheatley for the whole game and sticking the rest of them at the end.

1109
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,380
Rym: That's fine, Wheatley was pretty funny.

1110
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:36,280
Scott: That was definitely a good move.

1111
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:47,120
Rym: Wheatley was way funnier later, when he, like, in the early part, when he's just kind of talking at you, it wasn't that funny, but afterward, and little things, like in the beginning, when he's like, you know, say something, prove you don't have brain damage.

1112
01:02:47,602 --> 01:02:47,977
Scott: And you jump.

1113
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,580
Rym: It gives you all the cues for like, what button to hit, and it tells you to hit jump.

1114
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,600
Scott: Yeah, and he's like, alright, you jumped, you know, you jumped there, yeah, that was pretty good.

1115
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:08,720
Scott: But yeah, you gotta play Portal 2, it was one of the best designed games there is, you know, but it's just, the only complaint, pretty much, is that we're hardcore, and it's not challenging enough for our hardcore-ness.

1116
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:15,340
Scott: At least Half-Life 2, you can put it on balls hard mode, where like, you get killed instantly by a guy with a crossbow.

1117
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,480
Rym: Of course, look at Portal 1, it had the challenge chambers.

1118
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:25,980
Scott: But the thing is about challenge chambers is that those aren't different puzzles, they're just, it's like the puzzles aren't harder, they just want you to solve them very quickly.

1119
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:32,760
Scott: It's like, I don't want to solve it faster, I want to solve it, I want to solve something that is harder to solve, I want to spend like a good 20 minutes.

1120
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:37,860
Rym: Alright, well Bionic Commando had that, I couldn't beat even a fucking quarter of those challenges in Bionic Commando.

1121
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,920
Scott: Yeah, that's a good example, I like those though.

1122
01:03:40,341 --> 01:03:49,480
Scott: But I want a Portal chamber that takes me a good 15, 20 minutes to figure out, but is not hard in an obtuse way, but is hard in a Super Meat Boy way.

1123
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,400
Rym: I just want more game with the funny.

1124
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,880
Scott: They are coming out with a DLC that's gonna add more Portal chambers, so, hurrah.

1125
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:18,480
Rym: Because I did really, I think my favorite environmental part of the game is the huge shift when you find, you know, the original Aperture Science and Cave Johnson in the 50s, and how all the technology changes, like you find the 50s and the 60s and the 70s and the 80s and the 90s, and just like all the old infrastructure and how it gives you this impression of this huge area to explore.

1126
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:25,100
Rym: And actually, that was some of the most interesting puzzles, was just trying to get up through all those ruins.

1127
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:30,753
Scott: The only thing is that, what I was trying to say before, is that the atmosphere of the game, right, is I liked?

1128
01:04:30,813 --> 01:04:36,780
Scott: in Portal 1, even though GLaDOS is talking to you, it was a lot more quiet and alone in a Metroid kind of way.

1129
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,459
Rym: Most of the Cave Johnson part was like that.

1130
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,900
Scott: No, cause not really.

1131
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,740
Rym: No, you're forgetting, there's the parts where you're going through a bunch of test chambers.

1132
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:49,380
Rym: There's also the whole part where you're just in that gigantic area just trying to get up.

1133
01:04:49,800 --> 01:05:00,080
Scott: Well that very first, they talk about that in the commentary, how the very first time you go down in there, and when they try to give you that to make you feel, but that's just one part.

1134
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,480
Scott: You know, it's not like you felt that way for the whole game.

1135
01:05:03,161 --> 01:05:06,980
Rym: Well I don't want to feel the same way the whole game, cause I felt that in Portal 1, I wanted a different atmosphere.

1136
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:14,680
Scott: See, the thing is I like that alone in the dark Metroid kind of action, and I'm really disappointed, Metroid even got rid of it.

1137
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:22,180
Rym: See, now in the Cave Johnson part though, the fact that it wasn't a real person talking to you anymore, it literally was just recordings, you were still completely alone.

1138
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,500
Scott: Yeah, it's true, but you didn't feel the same Metroid-ness.

1139
01:05:26,141 --> 01:05:27,680
Rym: I don't know, I think you're obsessed with Metroid.

1140
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:37,819
Scott: I don't know, I just like it when games, you know, it's like Nintendo had something right, they make Link not talk, and they make Samus not have anyone else with her.

1141
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:40,472
Rym: That's true, that's a good move.

1142
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:49,400
Rym: I love the Animal King, I like how you get to see him at the end, I love the fact that you see him back there, and he is the Animal King.

1143
01:05:49,763 --> 01:05:51,560
Rym: You know, King of the Portals?

1144
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:51,955
Scott: I know.

1145
01:05:52,644 --> 01:05:54,180
Rym: Well, King of the... Turrets.

1146
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,940
Rym: Yeah, and the bit where you find the defective turrets, then you swap it out.

1147
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,360
Scott: Yeah, actually, that part, the first time through, cause I did it twice, cause I did commentary.

1148
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,520
Rym: I saved a turret before I was supposed to, and I carried him.

1149
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,540
Scott: Exactly, the first time I did it, I saved the turret, and I thought I had done something clever.

1150
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:16,820
Scott: And then when I went through doing the commentary, and I got to the same part, and realized that I would have had to do that no matter what, I was like, oh.

1151
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:18,660
Scott: I thought I had done a clever, different...

1152
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:23,777
Rym: But I love how every time Wheatley's like, don't look, he's pretty much, either doesn't have a solution, or...

1153
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,279
Scott: Or he brute forces it stupidly.

1154
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,078
Scott: Yeah, he just like, breaks it.

1155
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:34,500
Rym: But when he's trying to, quote unquote, hack the neurotoxin, and there's a lot of dialogue, I waited for a while, and just watched him just saying stuff.

1156
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:38,100
Rym: I don't even know how long it went on, I gave up and just solved the puzzle.

1157
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:45,520
Scott: The thing is, you can just go and get the, I didn't bother waiting to listen to dialogue, cause you can go listen to all the dialogue on YouTube, cause some people extracted it from the files.

1158
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,040
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

1159
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:49,960
Scott: Alright, yeah, Portal 2, if you haven't played Portal 1, play that.

1160
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,020
Rym: It was a triumph.

1161
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,540
Scott: If you haven't played Portal 2, play that after.

1162
01:06:54,681 --> 01:07:01,360
Scott: It's a no-brainer, even at the full price of 40 bucks, but if you're cheap, there's no reason not to wait if you've got someone to do the co-op with later.

1163
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,080
Rym: And you don't care about everybody making jokes about space!

1164
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,600
Scott: And you don't care about, yeah, then, you know, just buy it later when it's inevitably gonna be 20 bucks or whatever.

1165
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:18,480
Rym: I mean, seriously, you might have forgotten, or you might be young, when Portal 1 came out, it was, like, one of the greatest, like, revolutionary games ever.

1166
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,169
Scott: Yeah, and there's no other game like it, right?

1167
01:07:21,189 --> 01:07:23,700
Scott: You know, we always complain about all these games being genre-fied.

1168
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:29,220
Rym: Portal 1 and Portal 2 are, in my opinion, literally some of the greatest games ever made.

1169
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,697
Scott: Do you know any other FPS puzzle platformers?

1170
01:07:32,777 --> 01:07:33,320
Scott: I don't know any.

1171
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,942
Rym: Well, you could argue that many aspects of Half-Life 1 and 2.

1172
01:07:37,942 --> 01:07:40,519
Scott: Are platformers, but not puzzle platformers.

1173
01:07:41,941 --> 01:07:44,820
Rym: Some specific areas were puzzle platformers.

1174
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:45,357
Scott: Like what?

1175
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,800
Scott: Half-Life 2 has a couple physics puzzles.

1176
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:54,640
Rym: In Half-Life 1, I remember a room where you can enter coordinates to blow shit up on the map.

1177
01:07:55,366 --> 01:07:55,660
Scott: Okay.

1178
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:01,860
Rym: And you have to figure out a sequence of things to blow up while jumping between different areas to get out.

1179
01:08:02,884 --> 01:08:03,093
Scott: Uh-huh.

1180
01:08:03,849 --> 01:08:04,040
Scott: Yeah.

1181
01:08:04,641 --> 01:08:06,680
Scott: That's not exactly a Portal puzzle.

1182
01:08:06,985 --> 01:08:08,020
Rym: I didn't say Portal puzzle.

1183
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,599
Scott: It was not a platforming puzzle either.

1184
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:10,780
Rym: There was platforming involved.

1185
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,480
Scott: Yeah, but it's not a platforming puzzle.

1186
01:08:13,386 --> 01:08:14,379
Rym: I would argue that it kind of was.

1187
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:17,439
Scott: Anyway, that wasn't the whole game, right?

1188
01:08:17,921 --> 01:08:19,180
Rym: Anyway, let's go one step further.

1189
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:24,979
Rym: In the modern era, Valve is probably the most consistently great gaming company there is.

1190
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,437
Scott: Except for Blizzard, but I'm not a fan of them.

1191
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:30,859
Rym: They're not my kind of game, but they're consistently great for what they are.

1192
01:08:30,961 --> 01:08:31,819
Rym: So, yeah, you know what?

1193
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:38,180
Rym: Valve and Blizzard are probably the best gaming companies from actual game design perspectives.

1194
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,658
Scott: Oh, and if you're pla- Oh, one last thing while we end this show.

1195
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:44,800
Scott: If you're playing Portal on an Xbox or a PS3, you suck.

1196
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,399
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1197
01:08:56,580 --> 01:09:01,499
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1198
01:09:01,899 --> 01:09:06,939
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1199
01:09:07,182 --> 01:09:09,859
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1200
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:14,600
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1201
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:18,116
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1202
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:22,420
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1203
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,540
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
