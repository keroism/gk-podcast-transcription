1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,209
Rym: It's Wednesday, September 14th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:10,491
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,522 --> 00:00:12,916
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,420
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,160
Rym: Tonight, some final thoughts on Madoka Magica.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,348
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,258
Rym: Also known as...

8
00:00:27,472 --> 00:00:28,400
Scott: Well, Mr.

9
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:29,529
Rym: Say-The-Full-Name-Of-The-Show.

10
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:31,507
Scott: I was being sarcastic.

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,029
Rym: What is the full name of the show, Scott?

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,110
Scott: Puella Magi Madoka Magica.

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:35,830
Scott: Alright, alright.

14
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,790
Scott: But the point is that you usually put too many words in the opening.

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,290
Scott: And I'm always like, you could have said that with less words.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,630
Scott: So this time I was pulling a reverse for the funny.

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,663
Scott: I was saying, "Why don't you use more

18
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:47,147
Scott: words?".

19
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:54,350
Rym: Now, therefore, what's going on here, the incentive for me is to ignore anything you say about the opener.

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:01,348
Scott: The incentive for me is to pester and troll with a face that's like,

21
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:01,869
Scott: "Ayyy.".

22
00:01:02,456 --> 00:01:03,070
Scott: You mad?

23
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:04,050
Scott: You mad, bro?

24
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:05,729
Scott: You mad, co-host?

25
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:13,170
Rym: So anyway, we actually started the show tonight a little late because I got my new bike.

26
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:23,243
Rym: But as is typical with any bike shop in the world, and car mechanics, anything, when they say, oh, they leave a voicemail saying, "Hey, it'll be done.

27
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:25,108
Rym: Come by any time after

28
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:25,409
Rym: X.".

29
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,568
Rym: Whatever X time is.

30
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:34,330
Rym: It will not be done if you show up five minutes after X. It will never be done when they say it was done.

31
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,550
Rym: Because they don't think you'll be there when they say it was done.

32
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:37,971
Scott: Really?

33
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:41,130
Scott: My laundry, they said it would have been done at five, and I got it at five.

34
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,309
Scott: And by the way, did I tell the story on the show?

35
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:44,026
Rym: I don't know.

36
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:49,090
Scott: Anyway, so both laundry machines in my building were out of order.

37
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:51,830
Scott: So I'm like, shit, I gotta go to the laundromat.

38
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,390
Scott: But then I realized, shit, if I go to the laundromat, it's not like it's in my building.

39
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,110
Scott: I have to sit there and watch the laundry.

40
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,310
Scott: It's not like a college where you can go into dorms or you can go back to your apartment or your dorm and go back to the laundromat.

41
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:03,670
Scott: You gotta sit there with the clothes.

42
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:12,510
Rym: Granted, occasionally, even in dorms, going back to the room meant you'd come back and find all your clothes in a heap wet because some jackass decided they wanted to use the dryer.

43
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:12,850
Scott: Right.

44
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:13,875
Scott: Well, it depends on how.

45
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:17,230
Scott: I always use them at down, not peak times when there was less competition.

46
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,150
Scott: But anyway, in laundromat, a public one, you know, it's a real place of business.

47
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,338
Scott: You got to sit there with the clothes.

48
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:24,150
Scott: And I'm like, fuck me, it's Sunday.

49
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:25,781
Scott: I want to watch football.

50
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:26,809
Scott: I do not want to sit here.

51
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:29,510
Scott: Thanks to the watch clothes spin around in a circle.

52
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:30,789
Scott: So I was like, wait a minute.

53
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,989
Scott: Laundry service.

54
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:34,870
Scott: Oh, shit.

55
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,969
Scott: Life of luxury.

56
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:43,210
Scott: You give someone money, which I have extra, and they do your fucking laundry for you and they fucking fold it.

57
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,288
Scott: I was like, oh, shit, son, doing this.

58
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:46,674
Scott: So I did that.

59
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:50,730
Scott: It was like 30 pounds of laundry because I don't do laundry until all my clothes are dirty.

60
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:54,190
Scott: And it cost me like twenty six dollars or whatever.

61
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:55,554
Scott: And you know what?

62
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:58,310
Scott: They did a really great job and they folded my freaking clothes for me.

63
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,163
Scott: But yeah, there were only two negatives.

64
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:01,090
Scott: Well, and a positive.

65
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:01,772
Scott: Right.

66
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,501
Scott: So negative.

67
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,390
Scott: Well, that's actually one negative and a positive.

68
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:05,691
Scott: I don't know.

69
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:05,992
Scott: Whatever.

70
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:12,030
Scott: The point is, the only thing they did do that I did not like was they used fabric softener, which made my clothes smell.

71
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:14,320
Scott: And it wasn't a bad smell.

72
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,990
Rym: Never use fabric softener.

73
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,276
Scott: It wasn't a bad smell.

74
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,709
Scott: It was, you know, but it wasn't a good smell either.

75
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:21,386
Scott: It was sort of a laundry smell.

76
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:21,770
Scott: Right.

77
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,250
Scott: It's like my clothes smell like laundromat, you know, and I don't use fabric softener.

78
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,002
Scott: So it's like a smell that was used to keep going.

79
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:31,970
Rym: But just so you know, this is fascinating.

80
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,591
Scott: Right.

81
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:39,870
Scott: But the benefit was fabric softener actually made my clothes real soft, which is like fascinating.

82
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,931
Scott: It was.

83
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:50,570
Scott: And if your laundry machines are out of order, I highly recommend laundry service, especially when it's like right next door to your apartment to carry the clothes that far.

84
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:54,549
Rym: But anyway, I got my new bike and it's pretty fucking awesome.

85
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:56,864
Rym: Yeah, it was a way fast.

86
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:57,287
Rym: Great.

87
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:57,690
Rym: Yeah.

88
00:03:58,431 --> 00:03:58,752
Rym: OK.

89
00:03:58,953 --> 00:04:02,810
Rym: I got here from Avenue C and 14th Street in like 16 minutes.

90
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,021
Scott: What bike shop did you go to?

91
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:04,608
Scott: on Avenue C?

92
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,918
Rym: It's actually just past first.

93
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,889
Rym: It's between First Avenue and Avenue A on 14th Street.

94
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:09,864
Rym: What's it called?

95
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,298
Rym: Uh, Beshiro Bikes or something.

96
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,423
Rym: They have like five branches.

97
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:14,206
Rym: That's just the one.

98
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:14,849
Rym: I know the guys.

99
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:22,650
Scott: I usually go to Bicycle Habitat, which is like that's like the activist, you know, like it's the happening bike shop.

100
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,077
Rym: This place is pretty happening, too.

101
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:24,921
Rym: It's all chill dudes.

102
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:26,610
Rym: They're all pretty cool hanging out, talking to them.

103
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,156
Scott: There's also delivery.

104
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:30,486
Rym: guys are like fixing their bikes with their tools.

105
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:31,270
Rym: They don't care.

106
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:41,010
Scott: There's also Sid's Bikes, which is sort of like the the yuppie bike shop where everything is like, you know, it's like it's almost like it's a professional store, like everything shiny and modern.

107
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:46,790
Scott: And, you know, it looks like, you know, a you know, like not not low rent.

108
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,161
Scott: You know, most bike shops are just like, you know, in some pre-war building.

109
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:50,763
Scott: This isn't like.

110
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,110
Scott: it's like modern building, you know, whatever.

111
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:59,270
Scott: Anyway, very briefly, if you haven't seen, it's like the difference between a stop and shop and a path mark.

112
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:06,310
Rym: But exactly one week ago today, an interview with Atsuhira Iwakami was posted to the Anime News Network.

113
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,153
Rym: I'm going to link to it.

114
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:12,750
Rym: You probably don't know who that is, but it's the dude who produced Madoka Magica.

115
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:24,569
Rym: So if you liked Madoka or if you're an idiot, meaning you hated Madoka and you listen to our final thoughts and you want a little bit more from maybe someone who actually had a creative hand in it.

116
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:26,216
Rym: Well, here you go.

117
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:26,698
Rym: And you know what?

118
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,844
Rym: There's spoilers.

119
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:28,909
Scott: The interview is OK.

120
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,753
Scott: It was all right.

121
00:05:29,773 --> 00:05:31,925
Scott: It's not like fascinating, but, you know, it's all right.

122
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:32,650
Rym: It's worth reading.

123
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:36,324
Rym: Some of the questions are a little like, so whose idea was it?

124
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:37,308
Rym: to do blah?

125
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:37,830
Scott: Yeah.

126
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:39,520
Scott: Why did you do blah?

127
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:40,406
Scott: Anyway, right.

128
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,790
Scott: So in lieu of news, because you always trouble getting Wednesday news anyway, and it's usually not that exciting.

129
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,331
Scott: Right.

130
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:53,590
Scott: We've got a preview, as you may know, a Geek Byte preview, as you may or may not know.

131
00:05:54,071 --> 00:06:01,830
Scott: This month, the month that we are currently in, September of 2011, DC Comics has, quote, relaunched everything.

132
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:07,070
Scott: Every single DC comic there is was canceled and restarted at number one.

133
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,970
Scott: Right.

134
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:16,710
Scott: And there are now 52 DC Comics and they all the number one issues of every single one of those will be released over the course of the month of September.

135
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:20,550
Scott: And since I think there's already been two Wednesdays, like about half of them are already out.

136
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:26,490
Scott: I won't be getting any of them until the beginning of October when they come in the box in the mail.

137
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,515
Scott: I'll get them all at once.

138
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:30,230
Rym: Now, the but well, there's buzz on the Internet already.

139
00:06:30,752 --> 00:06:30,933
Scott: Yes.

140
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:35,130
Scott: But because there are people who go to the comic shop and they read them as soon as they come out on Wednesday.

141
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,485
Rym: But it's amazing how much of that buzz is.

142
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:39,470
Rym: fanboys complaining.

143
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:39,910
Scott: Right.

144
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:47,030
Scott: But one of the 52 comics was released at the end of August instead of in September.

145
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:56,370
Scott: That, you know, the premiere one, the Justice League number one, written by Geoff Johns and art by Jim Lee, came out and I had it in the previous box.

146
00:06:57,111 --> 00:07:06,010
Scott: So rather than do it on Scott's box, since we're going to talk about the rest of them, you know, the other 51 on this show, we'll do this first one on this show as the preview.

147
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,230
Scott: So me and Ram both read this Justice League number one.

148
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,810
Rym: So we have to pretend we're going to because, you know, we're going to review this in a fairly objective manner.

149
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:20,810
Rym: So going to pretend that nothing exists prior to or in parallel with this.

150
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,454
Scott: Well, I do actually.

151
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:27,689
Scott: That is one thing that I think they did a good job, right, is like they said relaunch.

152
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,374
Scott: They didn't say reset.

153
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:29,735
Scott: They didn't.

154
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:30,036
Scott: Right.

155
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:33,910
Scott: So I was like, what are they going to keep and what are they going to throw away?

156
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,191
Scott: Right.

157
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:40,650
Scott: They made it sound like they were going to keep some of the DC Comics history and get rid of some other stuff.

158
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,450
Scott: But in actuality, it was a 100 percent clean slate.

159
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:45,853
Scott: Right.

160
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:47,970
Scott: This is like Batman and Green Lantern.

161
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,389
Scott: They like Green Lantern is like, you're real, like they had never met.

162
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:52,934
Scott: You know, they like.

163
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:57,650
Scott: it's completely nothing from any previous DC comic matters at all.

164
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,373
Scott: You don't need to know.

165
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:01,710
Rym: I mean, they're talking about aliens and then one's like, oh, like that guy.

166
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:02,938
Rym: And they're referring to Superman.

167
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,850
Rym: They're like, oh, like that one I heard about.

168
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:05,392
Scott: Right.

169
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:08,590
Scott: I also think that it's pretty cool that they reset.

170
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:09,312
Scott: Right.

171
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:09,914
Scott: Everything.

172
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:13,970
Scott: And they didn't start with origin stories.

173
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:14,312
Scott: Right.

174
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:17,769
Scott: Because usually when you reset, they always do the origin story again.

175
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:18,951
Scott: Right.

176
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:21,830
Scott: But here they don't start with the origin story of any of the characters.

177
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,825
Scott: You don't have like Batman's parents getting killed.

178
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:25,669
Scott: You don't have green.

179
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,890
Scott: Right.

180
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,339
Scott: Everyone's already a superhero.

181
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:28,930
Scott: It's just that they don't know each other.

182
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,730
Scott: So it is sort of origin of Justice League, which is the title of the comic.

183
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:36,510
Scott: But it's not origin of Batman, origin of Superman, origin of Green Lantern.

184
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,320
Rym: But it is five years ago.

185
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:39,347
Rym: Oh, is it?

186
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,010
Scott: Yeah.

187
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:41,414
Scott: Oh, yeah.

188
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:48,990
Rym: Well, then, so it starts in media res and the beginning of that even then is not the origin stories.

189
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:51,916
Rym: However, I just want to note this.

190
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:53,280
Rym: It kind of bothers me.

191
00:08:53,822 --> 00:08:56,670
Rym: The five years ago is in the second panel.

192
00:08:57,131 --> 00:09:04,570
Rym: So you see a bunch of police with sniper rifles in a helicopter basically saying we have Batman in our sights.

193
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:11,070
Rym: Then it says five years ago and it shows a bunch of helicopters chasing Batman with sniper rifles.

194
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:11,872
Scott: Oh, yeah.

195
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,369
Scott: That five years ago should have been in the first panel.

196
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,803
Rym: Or maybe it's going to in some future like it's.

197
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,730
Rym: like the next issue is going to be like today.

198
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:21,422
Rym: And it's a different sniper fight with Batman.

199
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:22,447
Scott: It could be.

200
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:23,170
Scott: That would be cool.

201
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,250
Scott: But somehow I don't think that's what I don't think that either.

202
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:26,733
Rym: But I mean, I don't know.

203
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:32,890
Rym: I'm feeling this because right away it's Batman fucking some shit up and he's kind of I don't know.

204
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,814
Rym: There's a lot of snark.

205
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:34,738
Scott: Yeah.

206
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:35,601
Rym: From everybody.

207
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:37,730
Rym: I mean, Batman is kind of he's like idiots.

208
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,572
Rym: He's just throwing stuff.

209
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:38,873
Rym: Really?

210
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:44,870
Scott: It's like the thing is, it's like one of the personalities of these characters is just different levels and flavors of jerkiness.

211
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:45,771
Scott: Yeah.

212
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:46,214
Scott: Right.

213
00:09:46,234 --> 00:09:48,989
Scott: It's like everyone's, you know, almost wants to be dead.

214
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,554
Rym: But it's so stereotypical.

215
00:09:50,594 --> 00:09:55,430
Rym: Batman's fight, like chasing the supervillain and the police are chasing him and he knocks the supervillain over.

216
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,415
Rym: You know what he says to him?

217
00:09:57,058 --> 00:09:59,170
Rym: What were you doing at the docks?

218
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,833
Scott: It's so bad.

219
00:10:02,056 --> 00:10:07,210
Rym: It's like really this alien like war machine was at the docks doing something.

220
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:08,112
Rym: Yeah.

221
00:10:08,212 --> 00:10:08,333
Rym: OK.

222
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:12,530
Rym: But so Page four, there's Batman and he looks different.

223
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:17,329
Rym: And at the bottom of that page, all those panels lead you to an ad.

224
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:20,930
Rym: And then I remembered I was reading an issue and not a trade paperback.

225
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,310
Scott: Yeah.

226
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:22,414
Scott: This is why you read trades.

227
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:26,910
Scott: Basically, I think the way I'm going to score these issues, right, is it's going to be two possible scores.

228
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,116
Scott: One is I will buy the trade.

229
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:32,827
Scott: Two is I will never read it again because there's no way.

230
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,784
Scott: any of these comics, you know, even if there was the best thing in the universe, well, I'll buy the trade.

231
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:38,070
Scott: Right.

232
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:41,260
Scott: If it's not the best thing in the universe, I don't need to read it.

233
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,390
Scott: There's no comic where I would buy the issues of it ever.

234
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:46,115
Scott: So that's my score.

235
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:50,230
Scott: You know, so you know whether to read or if you agree with my tastes.

236
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:50,892
Scott: Right.

237
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:52,096
Scott: That's how I will score them.

238
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:56,010
Rym: So in this book, and there aren't that many pages, ten of the pages are ads.

239
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:56,892
Scott: Yep.

240
00:10:57,374 --> 00:11:00,101
Rym: Three, four, five, six, seven.

241
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:02,467
Rym: Seven more of the pages are just BS.

242
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:03,470
Rym: There's nothing to do with the comic.

243
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,018
Rym: And then up one more ad.

244
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:08,929
Rym: So eleven pages of ads and a bunch of pages of non-comic.

245
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:10,953
Scott: Yeah.

246
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:14,910
Scott: If you bought that comic at face value, which I did not, I got four dollars.

247
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,975
Scott: Yeah, I paid less than two dollars.

248
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,208
Scott: I think we paid 80 bucks for the whole thing and there's 52 comics.

249
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:23,735
Rym: So Batman, I can dig.

250
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:26,844
Rym: And I kind of like how the Green Lantern's like, what do you mean?

251
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:27,787
Rym: you don't have any powers?

252
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:28,148
Rym: Really?

253
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:28,288
Rym: Really?

254
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,835
Scott: Yeah, that was that was probably the best part of it.

255
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:36,230
Scott: The second best part of the whole thing was in Green Lantern is like, don't fucking tell me you're just a guy in a batsuit.

256
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,790
Rym: But simultaneously, the Green Lantern is kind of an all powerful God compared to Batman in this.

257
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,552
Scott: Well, he is.

258
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:43,214
Scott: But he also.

259
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:46,623
Scott: I didn't really I don't have any reason to like the Green Lantern.

260
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,325
Scott: He was just so.

261
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:48,850
Rym: he's great and he's helping everybody.

262
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:51,437
Rym: Yeah, Batman's actually the one giving him shit.

263
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:52,300
Scott: Yeah, but agree.

264
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,790
Scott: He was just sort of dopey and you know, you know, obviously his powers.

265
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,392
Rym: How is he dopey?

266
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:57,716
Rym: He's like, whatever, I'm invincible.

267
00:11:58,258 --> 00:11:59,944
Scott: Yeah, which is kind of dopey.

268
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:00,766
Rym: That's not dopey.

269
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:01,108
Rym: That's just.

270
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:01,770
Rym: I mean, if you're invincible.

271
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,718
Rym: It's like, why would you use fucking fire engines, right?

272
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:06,363
Rym: That's what I wondered about.

273
00:12:06,403 --> 00:12:07,927
Rym: How come he makes everything in analog?

274
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:08,849
Rym: Maybe you know what it is.

275
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,496
Rym: So in the Prince of Nothing, maybe he's not creative.

276
00:12:11,877 --> 00:12:16,810
Rym: In the Prince of Nothing, there's the analogy magic and then there's the abstract magic.

277
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:17,455
Rym: Spoilers.

278
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:19,069
Rym: You can only do analogies.

279
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:25,978
Scott: Actually, I think you got it wrong, but the analogies are part of them anyway.

280
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,240
Rym: No.

281
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:29,285
Scott: Anyway, regardless.

282
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:31,790
Rym: Anyway, but I don't know.

283
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,522
Rym: Superman appears and he's a little too snarky.

284
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:36,685
Scott: He is.

285
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:38,170
Scott: But actually, I was kind of liking that.

286
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,992
Rym: I like that too.

287
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:40,679
Rym: But they're all snarky.

288
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:43,650
Rym: Like they're all snarky in the same way, except Batman, who's just Batman.

289
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:47,240
Rym: So everybody's Batman except, well, Batman.

290
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:50,549
Rym: Batman is Batman and everybody else is snarky superhero.

291
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:57,590
Scott: We already went over this, that of the 52 comics, like over 25 percent of them are Batman or Batman related.

292
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,981
Rym: I hereby declare that Batman is DC's Wolverine.

293
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:01,630
Rym: He's on everybody's team.

294
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,633
Scott: That's not news.

295
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:04,319
Scott: That's been that way for a while.

296
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,090
Scott: But the point is they reset and they kept it that way.

297
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:13,870
Scott: Even though, despite resetting, and Green Lantern was sort of their more popular thing lately.

298
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,958
Scott: So they reset and they still went full Batman.

299
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:18,863
Scott: It's like, really?

300
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:21,070
Scott: You could have toned back and the suit is barely anything.

301
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,515
Rym: But Scott, really could you?

302
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:27,050
Rym: I mean, what's compelling about Aquaman compared to Batman?

303
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:33,247
Scott: The thing with Aquaman is no one tries to make him awesome and actually succeeds.

304
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:34,130
Scott: I could do it.

305
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:38,100
Rym: Because Aquaman is the same problem that Nightboat has.

306
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,110
Rym: If the crime doesn't occur on the water or near a conveniently located canal.

307
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,758
Scott: So you make the entire story underwater.

308
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,641
Rym: But they never do that.

309
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,370
Rym: He's just like the lame guy hanging around with the real kids.

310
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,392
Scott: Like fucking Little Mermaid.

311
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:50,394
Scott: Hello?

312
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:55,543
Scott: Anyway, most of the people who read superhero comics are not suspecting readers like us.

313
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:02,257
Scott: They just pretty much have a hero they care about.

314
00:14:02,318 --> 00:14:06,510
Scott: And I'll see people, literally, they'll go into the comic shop and they're Spider-Man guys.

315
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:13,810
Scott: They literally just walk down the aisle and every comic that's on the new comic shelf that has Spider-Man on it, or any spider anything, they take.

316
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,036
Scott: And then they go directly to the checkout.

317
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,059
Scott: They don't look at anything else.

318
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,570
Scott: So there's people who go to the comic shop, a lot of them, who just walk down the aisle.

319
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,300
Scott: And anything that's bat anything, they take.

320
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:24,344
Scott: And they go to the checkout.

321
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:25,047
Scott: And that's all they do.

322
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:25,730
Scott: Every month.

323
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:28,342
Scott: So that's why there's a lot of Batman comics.

324
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:29,930
Scott: That's the only reason.

325
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,603
Scott: Overall, I gotta say, I've never liked a Geoff Johns comic ever.

326
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:37,970
Scott: I'm usually way down on him.

327
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,654
Scott: He wrote four fanboys.

328
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:40,778
Scott: He is a fanboy.

329
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:45,130
Scott: Remember he wrote that Green Lantern Rebirth, which was awful?

330
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:46,090
Rym: Oh my god.

331
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,990
Scott: Which started off the whole Green Lantern comic.

332
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:48,936
Rym: That was your fault.

333
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:50,847
Rym: You handed that to me and you're like, "We gotta review

334
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:51,089
Rym: this.".

335
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:51,869
Scott: Yeah, we did.

336
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:52,718
Rym: Yeah.

337
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:53,395
Scott: Right.

338
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:55,189
Scott: And pretty much all his comics are like that.

339
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:58,344
Rym: Didn't you go to all those comic guys and they were like, "This is good.

340
00:14:58,444 --> 00:14:59,269
Rym: This is something you should

341
00:14:59,309 --> 00:14:59,550
Rym: read.".

342
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,335
Scott: Yeah, I was like, because the Green Lantern was so popular.

343
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:03,923
Scott: So I was like, "This Green Lantern is so popular.

344
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:04,746
Scott: Everyone's reading it.

345
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:06,069
Scott: I gotta see what the deal

346
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,210
Scott: is.".

347
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,295
Scott: So I'm like, "Where does it

348
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:07,656
Scott: begin?".

349
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:09,464
Scott: They're like, "You gotta start with the Green Lantern Rebirth.

350
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:10,247
Scott: That's where it begins.

351
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:10,689
Scott: That's where it all

352
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:10,850
Scott: starts.".

353
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:12,842
Scott: And I read it and I was like, "Wow, that's

354
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:13,144
Scott: awful.".

355
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,730
Scott: But I think here what happens is you had Geoff Johns and they forced him to reset.

356
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:29,050
Scott: And by forcing him to reset, the primary thing that was wrong with his writing was his fanboy pandering, which is also self-pandering because he's a fanboy.

357
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:38,190
Scott: And by forcing him to reset, you took away his primary negative writing trait, which was dropping things for fanboys.

358
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,775
Scott: And therefore, I mean, this isn't great.

359
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:48,030
Scott: I'm not going to buy the trait of this or read any more of it, but it was the best Geoff Johns comic I've read.

360
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,641
Scott: And also the Jim Lee art is still pretty great.

361
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:50,810
Scott: I like the colors, especially.

362
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,604
Rym: But they're already going a little cliche in that the title of the next one says, and I quote, "Batman vs.

363
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:57,546
Rym: Superman.".

364
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,581
Scott: Dun dun dun.

365
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:01,890
Scott: There's a reason I'm not buying any trains.

366
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,750
Rym: No, Superman's kind of a dick.

367
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:08,549
Scott: I like Dick Superman better than regular old, you know, American Pie Superman.

368
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,830
Rym: I really worry he's going to be the exact same kind of dick that the Green Lantern is.

369
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,123
Scott: But that's the other thing is that being a dick doesn't work if everyone's a dick.

370
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,910
Scott: You need people to suffer the trolling.

371
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,563
Scott: You can't just have a bunch of trolls, right?

372
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,455
Scott: There has to be someone who gets... It'll be Aquaman.

373
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:23,645
Rym: He'll be like, "Guys, come

374
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:24,330
Rym: on!".

375
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:24,691
Scott: Right.

376
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:29,190
Scott: You know, troll-estia doesn't work if it's also troll-light-sparkle and troll-dash.

377
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:31,896
Scott: It doesn't work.

378
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:34,069
Scott: It only works when it's just troll-estia.

379
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,693
Rym: So, we'll see.

380
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:39,230
Rym: We'll read the rest of these and have detailed reviews.

381
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:50,590
Rym: Notice I did not say anything unnecessarily disparaging because if I ignore every other DC comic that has ever existed, and just to read this, I am kind of curious what happens on the next page.

382
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,990
Scott: Yeah, this is not awful.

383
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,021
Rym: And the art's okay.

384
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:53,610
Rym: I like the art.

385
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,819
Scott: Yeah, this is not so bad.

386
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:02,890
Scott: I haven't read any Justice League ever, but this is better than any Justice League I've ever read.

387
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:05,520
Scott: It's better than Super Friends.

388
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:06,790
Scott: That's a plus.

389
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,449
Rym: So there is one more very important news.

390
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:17,710
Rym: This weekend, the second season of a show called My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic, is going to air.

391
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:21,582
Scott: It's a Saturday morning cartoon now on The Hub 9 a.m.

392
00:17:21,662 --> 00:17:22,063
Scott: Eastern, 6 a.m.

393
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:22,605
Scott: Pacific.

394
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:42,690
Rym: It is safe to say that I've been looking forward to this more than I've looked forward to any season of any show since I saw a trailer to Escaflowne when I was still in high school.

395
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,205
Scott: I mean, even shows...

396
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:49,830
Rym: When I heard there was going to be a second gig to Stand Alone Complex, I was equally excited.

397
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,370
Scott: Even if you told me that there was another Stand Alone Complex gig, a third gig, right?

398
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:59,050
Scott: I'd probably wait until the whole thing was done and watch it all in a big blob.

399
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,214
Scott: Only for ponies.

400
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:07,750
Scott: am I going to need to go on YouTube on Saturday afternoon after someone uploads it and watch it immediately.

401
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,288
Rym: Yeah, you realize that if I have access to a TV that I can change the channel on...

402
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:13,369
Scott: And it has The Hub?

403
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:15,563
Rym: I'm going to watch it live on TV.

404
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:16,630
Rym: That'll be the first show.

405
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,385
Scott: On Saturday at 9 a.m.

406
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:18,248
Rym: I have a watch.

407
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,610
Scott: With little girl commercials.

408
00:18:20,553 --> 00:18:21,690
Rym: We'll see what the commercials are.

409
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,930
Scott: You going to watch Pound Puppies after?

410
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:23,194
Rym: No.

411
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:25,362
Rym: Are you kidding?

412
00:18:25,382 --> 00:18:25,970
Rym: Fuck that.

413
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:28,029
Scott: You know, the same people make both the shows.

414
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:28,630
Scott: Don't care.

415
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,230
Rym: I don't trust that Pound Puppies at all.

416
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,663
Scott: Actually, there were some commercials that they had on Equestria Daily.

417
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:37,930
Scott: that were promotional commercials for the new pony season.

418
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,769
Rym: Nobody has moves like the girls with the hooves.

419
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:42,230
Scott: No, they were also Pound Puppy commercials.

420
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,170
Scott: They were promoting that whole block of two shows on Saturday morning.

421
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,330
Rym: Why can't My Little Pony just be on Toonami?

422
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:48,535
Scott: Yeah.

423
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:53,470
Rym: Someone even made a trailer that was like Toonami with My Little Pony.

424
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,870
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

425
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,448
Scott: Why can't they just put it directly on fucking YouTube themselves instead of having...

426
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,996
Rym: You know what?

427
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:03,770
Rym: If I could just buy the episodes with the correct colors... For a dollar.

428
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,456
Rym: For a dollar.

429
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:05,330
Rym: I would pay a dollar.

430
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,169
Scott: But they're charging a zillion dollars on iTunes.

431
00:19:08,553 --> 00:19:09,845
Rym: But they're charging a zillion dollars.

432
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:10,209
Rym: and the colors...

433
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,026
Scott: And it's also 720p what they're charging for, not 1080p.

434
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,889
Scott: And the colors are all fucked up.

435
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,030
Scott: Give me 1080p's with the right colors for a dollar.

436
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:19,530
Rym: Or at least sell some DVDs.

437
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,110
Scott: Ten dollar season pass.

438
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,265
Rym: Anyway, yeah, we like ponies and it's coming.

439
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:23,809
Rym: You should watch it.

440
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,232
Scott: Ponies.

441
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:25,685
Scott: The return of the ponies.

442
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:26,310
Scott: Internet explode.

443
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:26,813
Scott: You know what?

444
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:28,690
Scott: I'm gonna already declare victory.

445
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,510
Scott: We managed to carry... This tells you the power of the pony.

446
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,049
Scott: That, you know, it was big, but we managed to carry that stone.

447
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,330
Scott: Sisyphus pushed the pony rock up the hill to the next season.

448
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:47,470
Rym: The fact that the PMVs... Not only did they keep being made for this entire duration, but the frequency increased.

449
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,272
Scott: Yeah.

450
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:54,150
Scott: There has been... They have made a Draw Friend post on Equestria Daily every single day.

451
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:55,409
Rym: For how long?

452
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,183
Scott: At least a long time.

453
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,001
Rym: We could probably... We're not doing this.

454
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:01,228
Rym: Shut up, kids.

455
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:01,510
Rym: No.

456
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:07,210
Rym: I feel like if we turned the news on Wednesdays into just ponies, we'd have enough to talk about.

457
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:07,823
Scott: Maybe.

458
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:09,368
Rym: Every week.

459
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:12,050
Scott: No more pony.

460
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,129
Scott: All the pony is now relegated to a separate show.

461
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,709
Rym: Called Radio Free Equestria.

462
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,289
Scott: No more pony in the show.

463
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:19,429
Rym: That you should watch.

464
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:20,053
Scott: None.

465
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:21,950
Scott: Except for occasional jokes.

466
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,220
Rym: But anyway, very briefly, things of the day.

467
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,160
Rym: So, not technically a College Humor, but a Darkly, but of this kind of joke?

468
00:20:36,283 --> 00:20:36,919
Scott: It's College Humor.

469
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:39,320
Rym: This is very... I could link to the Darkly one.

470
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,799
Rym: It's on Darkly as well.

471
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,600
Scott: Which is the same people as College Humor.

472
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,320
Rym: It's a different site.

473
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,120
Scott: It's the same office.

474
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,486
Rym: So?

475
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,620
Rym: Anyway, it's linked with a portal gun, but it is actually extremely well done, and you will enjoy this.

476
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:52,200
Scott: Yeah.

477
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,040
Rym: Possibly more so if you've actually played A Link to the Past, and if you haven't, well... What the fuck?

478
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:58,400
Rym: That's really a shame.

479
00:20:59,463 --> 00:21:01,280
Scott: If you haven't, that is your assignment.

480
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,300
Scott: Unless you also haven't played Super Metroid, in which case that is your first assignment.

481
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:05,899
Rym: I would start with Link to the Past.

482
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,600
Rym: I prefer games like this to games like Metroid.

483
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,278
Scott: Super Metroid.

484
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:10,670
Rym: Anyway.

485
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,240
Scott: Best.

486
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:11,692
Scott: Anyway.

487
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:13,198
Scott: So.

488
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,176
Scott: Cats.

489
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,318
Scott: They're funny.

490
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,200
Scott: They are.

491
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,280
Scott: All internet funniness comes from cat.

492
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,259
Scott: Cat is like, if there was a... Cat is like, you know, protons.

493
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,620
Scott: It's a primordial element.

494
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,020
Scott: Right.

495
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,878
Scott: It's like protons.

496
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,680
Scott: If you're making internet humor, figuring out internet humor science, you get your microscope, you zoom way in, cat.

497
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:38,000
Scott: No matter what it is, you could be zooming in on like, you know, two girls, one cup, and you zoom way in, way in, way in, and you'll see it's just made of cat.

498
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:42,480
Scott: So, here is some raw internet hilarity.

499
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,900
Scott: They take in many classic paintings that are the kind that you find in museums.

500
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,559
Scott: You know, famous ones.

501
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,600
Scott: And they replaced the primary or perhaps secondary characters, or whatever one was most humorous, with cat.

502
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:55,700
Scott: But not any cat.

503
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,320
Scott: This one particular orange cat.

504
00:21:57,841 --> 00:22:00,580
Scott: In a variety of poses, matching the poses in the picture.

505
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:02,480
Scott: It is the funny.

506
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,620
Scott: I encourage you to make more in this vein.

507
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,300
Rym: It is very reminiscent of the old...

508
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,659
Scott: They have not fully explored this particular combination of humor, and I think there are great opportunities for Lowell.

509
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,520
Rym: It's in the style of the old Photoshop Fridays that I used to be a huge fan of.

510
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,020
Scott: It's more of a comedy goldmine.

511
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:20,179
Rym: Ah, yeah.

512
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:25,440
Rym: It depends, because the old Photoshop Friday would be, here's a picture, do something funny to it.

513
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:29,540
Rym: And the comedy goldmine would be, here's an element, do something funny with it.

514
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,700
Scott: Right, but I think this is more, you know, Photoshop Friday was, here's a picture, do whatever.

515
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,780
Scott: This is, do this specific thing.

516
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,899
Rym: But to any picture.

517
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:38,680
Scott: Ah, true.

518
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,600
Rym: Yeah, they're two sides of the same coin.

519
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,731
Scott: It's more, maybe it's a worth 1000?

520
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:43,054
Scott: I don't know.

521
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,840
Scott: There's so many differences.

522
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,594
Rym: Regardless, I laughed out loud.

523
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:47,220
Rym: This is pretty good.

524
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,692
Scott: This is good.

525
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:47,940
Scott: Check it.

526
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,399
Rym: I feel like the only way to make this better is to turn it into on the go.

527
00:22:52,526 --> 00:22:53,140
Scott: You and your on the go.

528
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:53,939
Rym: I love on the go.

529
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:55,258
Scott: Alright, metamoments.

530
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:56,079
Scott: The metamoments.

531
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,000
Rym: The Book Club book is The Year of the Hour by Nancy Farr.

532
00:22:58,061 --> 00:22:59,380
Rym: We'll do the show as soon as I finish reading it.

533
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,019
Rym: I didn't read it yet because it didn't get delivered to me until a week and a half ago.

534
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:03,096
Scott: Why did I get mine?

535
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,660
Scott: It's weird because I ordered mine on Amazon and I got it immediately.

536
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,092
Scott: I know.

537
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,019
Scott: And nobody else did.

538
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:10,580
Scott: Even though they all also ordered it on Amazon immediately.

539
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,600
Rym: I know, like we ordered it the same fucking day.

540
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:14,019
Rym: So, anyway.

541
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,530
Scott: I don't know.

542
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,059
Scott: Other meta things.

543
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,520
Rym: Radio Free Equestria is coming back.

544
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,113
Rym: Yeah.

545
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,456
Rym: For real.

546
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:22,340
Rym: Well, coming back.

547
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,240
Scott: We already discussed that.

548
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:24,538
Rym: Yes, but it's meta now.

549
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,900
Rym: So, Google or YouTube for Radio Free Equestria.

550
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,258
Scott: There is going to be, on 11/11/11, November 11th, that weekend, the Burning Apocalypse Con.

551
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:45,340
Scott: It's going to be a Burning Wheel, Luke Crane-ish convention of roleplaying in New York City, but also a Vince Baker Apocalypse World roleplay.

552
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:54,320
Scott: Two indie RPG guys come together to make one weekend of roleplaying off the hook, 11/11/11.

553
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,440
Scott: And if you can get to New York City, registration is going to be opening mad soon.

554
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:02,539
Scott: If any of my friends want to come to it, we've got couches.

555
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:04,959
Rym: Only so many couches.

556
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:06,238
Scott: Three couches.

557
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,439
Scott: Cut it out.

558
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,137
Scott: Cut it out.

559
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:10,838
Scott: Check us out on the internets.

560
00:24:12,503 --> 00:24:14,980
Scott: And worst webcomic contest, next Wednesday show.

561
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,858
Scott: That's what that's going to be.

562
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,099
Scott: Well, I guess actually two Wednesday shows from now.

563
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,580
Rym: Next Wednesday, we're cutting off submissions.

564
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,333
Scott: Yeah.

565
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,240
Scott: Well, I think we said we knew that before.

566
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:23,660
Scott: Whatever.

567
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,020
Scott: The next Wednesday show we record is going to be that show.

568
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:27,580
Rym: You know what?

569
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,880
Rym: We're going to cut off submissions arbitrarily at some point.

570
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,640
Scott: That's right.

571
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:38,700
Rym: So if you haven't entered yet and you want to, well, do it now or you'll miss it.

572
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,196
Scott: That's right.

573
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:41,500
Scott: Can we think of anything else?

574
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,520
Scott: There's no swags, the next conventions are next year, other than Burning Apocalypse Con.

575
00:24:47,242 --> 00:24:48,134
Scott: MAGFest is the biggest one.

576
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,980
Scott: The New York Comic Con is coming, but it doesn't look like we're doing anything there.

577
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,580
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people aren't doing stuff there.

578
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:57,798
Rym: The short answer, having talked to a lot of people on their side, is that you know how cons sell out?

579
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,620
Rym: It's a sold out and not as in it's out of batches.

580
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,020
Scott: No, sold out like the monkeys.

581
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:07,797
Scott: I'm going to the Giants game Monday night against St.

582
00:25:07,857 --> 00:25:08,259
Scott: Louis.

583
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,972
Scott: If you're going to be there, call me.

584
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,639
Scott: We can say hi at the stadium.

585
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:16,740
Rym: We used to do a lot more final thoughts episodes.

586
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:18,160
Scott: We hardly did any ever.

587
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,180
Scott: We started doing them.

588
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,277
Scott: We did a handful of them in the entire history of these guys.

589
00:25:22,351 --> 00:25:25,320
Rym: But we haven't done them in a while, so I feel like this warning is very important.

590
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:37,820
Rym: If you have not seen every single episode of Puella Magica, every single episode of the original show, do not listen to this episode.

591
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,859
Rym: Do not fucking spoil the show.

592
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:42,700
Scott: Actually, I just want to add a minor note.

593
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,760
Scott: We can discuss this later.

594
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:54,980
Scott: I think we already did a show about spoilers, but you know, I always say, hey, look, if a show can be ruined by spoilers, then that means the only thing the show had going for it was that it had the element of surprise.

595
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:59,740
Scott: And, you know, if surprise is all you got, that's pretty cheap and such.

596
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,039
Scott: There was actually a study, a scientific study, where they had people read stories and judge them and say how much they liked them and stuff like that.

597
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:11,298
Scott: And some of them had spoilers up front and some of them didn't.

598
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,520
Scott: People thought it's like people's expectation is that a spoiler will ruin something.

599
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,580
Scott: But in reality, they like it more.

600
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:29,439
Scott: They enjoy it more when it is spoiled, because when you know more about something, you can, you know, pay more closer attention and get more out of it, which is why you should watch Madoka twice.

601
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:37,276
Rym: But at the same time, I saw Cowboy Bebop in its entirety and nothing had been spoiled for me.

602
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:41,560
Rym: Neither the deaths nor the end nor non deaths.

603
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:41,960
Rym: Yes.

604
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,339
Rym: Everything along the way.

605
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,800
Rym: Nothing was spoiled.

606
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:48,860
Rym: So I had about three moments of shock during the show.

607
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:51,499
Rym: And I'm glad that I got to experience that.

608
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:58,799
Scott: The thing was, is like, even though I also was not spoiled, I saw them coming like a zillion miles away.

609
00:26:59,421 --> 00:27:04,837
Rym: One of them, it was the kind of thing where I expected something to happen as the end of the show.

610
00:27:05,301 --> 00:27:13,200
Rym: And the fact that it happened out of nowhere, suddenly with no fanfare in the middle, like that really took me by surprise anyway.

611
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:17,459
Scott: But the point is, you know, the only, you know, I don't think spoiling is that actually bad.

612
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:23,719
Scott: So maybe you're someone who agrees with me and you believe in science and you know that spoiling will actually make you enjoy the show more.

613
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:26,679
Scott: It might be OK for you to listen to this.

614
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,358
Scott: I would still recommend you don't.

615
00:27:28,903 --> 00:27:29,739
Rym: And then go watch it.

616
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:37,556
Rym: I really recommend you don't, because the layers of what happens in episode 10 are pretty great.

617
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:39,739
Scott: So now we're going to spoil this.

618
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,400
Rym: We're going to spoil the crap out of the show.

619
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,480
Rym: We're assuming that you've seen all of Madoka Magica.

620
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,620
Rym: We don't need to research, like do the whole plot.

621
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:47,420
Scott: Or I'm assuming you don't care about being spoiled.

622
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:47,792
Rym: Yep.

623
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:52,380
Rym: So the Groundhog Day thing really got me right.

624
00:27:52,580 --> 00:28:04,220
Scott: So the thing that the Groundhog Day I thought was so fascinating was that, you know, you think Groundhog Day is so cliche and so famous and such a great movie that everyone knows that nobody else would ever dare to make a Groundhog Day.

625
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,351
Scott: Right.

626
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,219
Scott: Like if I made a show and in it I pulled a Groundhog Day or I wrote a comic book and in it I pulled a Groundhog Day.

627
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:11,980
Scott: People just be like, oh, you're pulling a Groundhog Day.

628
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,099
Scott: It wasn't even on my radar.

629
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:21,140
Rym: And when that episode starts up and I see Homura looking nerdy at the front of the room, I thought I was like, oh, shit, I know what happened.

630
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:22,880
Rym: She went back.

631
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,978
Rym: She met Madoka, who is a magical girl, and went back in time or something like she to save her.

632
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,980
Scott: Because the thing you knew from early in the show was that somehow she knew these things.

633
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,340
Scott: She knew where the nurse's office was.

634
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,320
Scott: She knew Madoka's name.

635
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,944
Rym: I expected that she'd become a magical girl and her wish was to save Madoka from some tragedy.

636
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:42,300
Rym: that probably was the dream from the beginning.

637
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:43,179
Rym: That's what I thought.

638
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,140
Scott: Yeah, or something.

639
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:45,725
Rym: And then when?

640
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:47,634
Rym: that Groundhog Day again, again.

641
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,280
Scott: But the difference here, right, is that number one, Groundhog Day, the movie, Bill Murray.

642
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:55,439
Scott: Groundhog Day, right, is about one guy.

643
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:08,080
Scott: It's from his perspective doing the Groundhog Day and it's, you know, the Groundhog Day is happening throughout the entire movie, right, as the viewer, and he's doing it at least from the start for selfish reasons.

644
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,080
Scott: He's trying to improve himself, you know, he's trying to achieve some goal on his own.

645
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:26,319
Scott: In Madoka, you're from the perspective of someone else, you don't see the Groundhog Day happening, so it's like you're the girl in Groundhog Day, not Bill Murray, and you're just living one of the Groundhog Days, not all of them.

646
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:28,520
Rym: Well, specifically the last one.

647
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,880
Scott: Yes, the last Groundhog Day, only.

648
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,460
Scott: You don't see all the Groundhog Days that came before until episode 10.

649
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,911
Rym: And I definitely get the impression that Homura lived through hundreds if not thousands of these.

650
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,717
Scott: Yeah, lots of them.

651
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,760
Rym: That was a crushing series of failures along the way.

652
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:52,446
Scott: And on top of that, the Groundhog Day is not, instead of being, you know, this self, it still has that character.

653
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:57,060
Scott: who's doing the Groundhog Day is improving themselves, their skills, their abilities, right?

654
00:29:57,281 --> 00:30:03,679
Scott: But one person is doing it sort of for themselves, at least, you know, until Bill Murray's doing it mostly for himself.

655
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,480
Scott: Homura's not doing it for herself at all, at all, right?

656
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,080
Scott: She's doing the whole thing for someone else.

657
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,600
Scott: And also, she's doing it in an adventure action way, right?

658
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:19,360
Scott: Bill Murray wasn't improving his gun shooting and bomb skills, he was improving his piano.

659
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,625
Rym: Well, early on, that was the thing, you know, suddenly when she rips out a grenade, I'm like,

660
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:22,959
Rym: "What?".

661
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,659
Rym: And then when she shoots Kyubey right before Madoka was about to become a magical girl, and she drops the gun.

662
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:35,747
Rym: And as she's dropping it, all I remember thinking was, "That gun is a pistol, and yet all those bullet holes appeared on Kyubey

663
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,279
Rym: simultaneously.".

664
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:40,480
Scott: Yeah, and it's like they give you those hints, too, throughout the show.

665
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,140
Rym: But then even right there, Kyubey's like, "You're not from this timeline, are you?

666
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,151
Rym: It's some sort of time

667
00:30:45,172 --> 00:30:45,900
Rym: manipulation.".

668
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,786
Scott: Yeah, and it's like she uses the time.

669
00:30:47,847 --> 00:31:00,719
Scott: stop, you know, everyone's magical power is related to the wish they made, you know, and their soul gem is related to the wish they made, you know, like how, what's the green hair girl's name?

670
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:02,739
Rym: You already forgot what you told me.

671
00:31:04,146 --> 00:31:04,779
Rym: Her hair's blue.

672
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,858
Rym: It's green.

673
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:07,239
Rym: It's blue.

674
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,240
Scott: Anyway, so Sayaka, she wishes, you know, for the musical kid to get better, right?

675
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:20,279
Scott: So all her magic, she has swords, and all her magic has like musical notes all over it, you know, and it's all related to the thing that she wished for.

676
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:28,479
Scott: You know, in the same way that, you know, Homura wished to go back in time, well, so all her magic is time related, you know?

677
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:40,260
Rym: I just, I couldn't, it was really hard to watch all the, like, every iteration along the way, and I like how they showed you a lot of them, and how it's like you can see- And they showed you ones that were really meaningful, right?

678
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,960
Scott: They showed you ones where she significantly improved her skills.

679
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:46,339
Scott: They showed you, you know, past, they showed you why.

680
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,640
Scott: It's like from the beginning of the show, you're like, Homura obviously knows something.

681
00:31:49,903 --> 00:31:51,160
Scott: Why doesn't she just come out with it?

682
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,319
Scott: Well, because the last time she tried that, it didn't work.

683
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:55,420
Scott: That's why she's not trying it this time.

684
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,060
Rym: Well, not just the last time, every time.

685
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,180
Rym: You see how every time she lives through this, it ends in horrible tragedy, some worse than others.

686
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:04,440
Scott: Yeah, she tries something different every time, and it doesn't work.

687
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:15,520
Rym: The most crushing ones for me were the one where Mami murders Kyoko after they figure out that they're going to turn into witches, and then Madoka has to kill Kyoko before she kills Homura.

688
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:16,200
Rym: Yeah, right.

689
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,951
Rym: Like, that was rough.

690
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,300
Scott: That was rough.

691
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:26,560
Scott: But no, the rougher one was where Madoka is going to turn into a witch, and then Homura has to kill her before she goes back in time.

692
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:33,379
Rym: But even in the timeline we saw, Kyoko realized what was going on and killed herself to destroy Sayaka as a witch to save her.

693
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:33,794
Scott: Yep.

694
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:35,559
Rym: And her blue hair!

695
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,460
Rym: See?

696
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:36,770
Rym: Blue.

697
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,458
Scott: Whatever.

698
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,280
Rym: That's blue, Scott.

699
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:39,259
Rym: Not green.

700
00:32:39,401 --> 00:32:40,260
Scott: I can't really see it from here.

701
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,000
Rym: He told me he had green hair, and she didn't really matter.

702
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:43,080
Scott: It's greenish blue.

703
00:32:43,404 --> 00:32:43,819
Rym: It's not.

704
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,418
Rym: It's blue.

705
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:45,199
Scott: Whatever.

706
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:50,259
Scott: So, what else can we say about the show?

707
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:00,600
Rym: Well, I pretty much had guessed from pretty early on that the whole thing was going to come down to, you know, in a past life or in another world somewhere.

708
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:09,480
Rym: I thought it was actually going to be, like, Bokerano style, like there's another world where Madoka was a magical girl, and Homura became a magical girl wishing to spare her this fate.

709
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:17,680
Rym: And that in this world, Kyubey now appears and tries to get Madoka anyway, because that wouldn't technically be breaking the wish if Madoka wished it again.

710
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,057
Scott: Oh, yeah.

711
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,899
Scott: That's a crazy thinking.

712
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:20,040
Rym: That's what I expected.

713
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:26,399
Rym: And it was actually really close, just I did not suspect the degree or nature or the Groundhog Day.

714
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:26,991
Scott: Yeah.

715
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:30,420
Scott: I mean, I was pretty much the whole time, right?

716
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:32,680
Scott: I was like, well, you get a wish, right?

717
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:44,700
Scott: So I was like, why don't you, you know, nobody tried to wish for more wishes or wish to be a magical girl, but not have your soul gem ever run out or wish to be a magical girl.

718
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:49,438
Scott: But or I was thinking, why don't you make a wish that all magical girls are invincible and immortal?

719
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:51,099
Scott: You know, make that your wish.

720
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,289
Rym: Yeah.

721
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,800
Rym: But we already knew that there must be a balance in the world between hope and despair.

722
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:56,080
Scott: Right.

723
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:08,480
Scott: And it wasn't ever, you know, they never make the rules super clear like they do in Death Note and Kyubey's, you know, I mean, you look at the Bokerano, at least he tells you all the rules, you know, but or Death Note.

724
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,480
Scott: They tell you all the rules.

725
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:11,679
Scott: In this one, Kyubey is just a jerk straight up.

726
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,918
Rym: I love the second time through, I noticed how pretty much everything Madoka does.

727
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:19,580
Rym: He's like, you know, you can make a contract with me.

728
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:32,400
Scott: Yeah, Kyubey, he personally intentionally gets them into situations where they, you know, it's like he's like, Sayaka, let's go into the marble before Mommy shows up and wait there.

729
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,260
Rym: Oh, by the way, there happens to be a grief seed right here.

730
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,429
Scott: Yeah.

731
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:41,260
Scott: If anything bad happens in there or Mommy doesn't show up on time, you can always make the contract and become a magical.

732
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,471
Rym: I imagine walking around like Madoka drops her parfait and Kyubey is like, I could fix that.

733
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:51,998
Scott: It's like if Madoka and Sayaka just didn't go near any fucking grief seeds or go into any of those reality marbles and just kept going to school.

734
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,634
Scott: But could they?

735
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,340
Rym: I would argue that part of the story here is that it's the Bilbo Baggins.

736
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,420
Rym: Once you're Bilbo, there is no way back.

737
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,198
Rym: There's no way home.

738
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:08,137
Scott: Well, the thing is, you could have wished, for example, you could be like, I wish I never knew about these reality marbles or wishes and I stopped seeing them because clearly not everyone sees them.

739
00:35:08,752 --> 00:35:08,878
Rym: Wait.

740
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,219
Rym: But to get that wish, you now become a magical girl.

741
00:35:12,942 --> 00:35:14,327
Scott: I know that's why it would be fucked up.

742
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:17,340
Rym: paradox, you know, how the paradoxes resolve themselves.

743
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:17,800
Rym: They're monkeys.

744
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,217
Rym: Pause.

745
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,479
Rym: Despair and hope are always balanced.

746
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,700
Rym: Homer made her wish to live it over again.

747
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,339
Scott: That's a full mental alchemist right there.

748
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,980
Rym: But by wishing to live it over again, equal exchange, the outcome could not be different.

749
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:29,596
Rym: Yep.

750
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:31,260
Rym: It would always end in tragedy.

751
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:34,560
Rym: I mean, look, one time they beat the witch just fine.

752
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,638
Rym: But now everyone else is dead and the two of them are going to become witches like there's there's no way.

753
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:47,160
Rym: Though I like how in this in the main universe, like the last one we see, Madoka is kind of normal and yet everyone says she has so much potential.

754
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:50,279
Rym: I like how there was actually a really rational explanation for that.

755
00:35:51,462 --> 00:35:56,600
Scott: They don't leave anything like why, you know, it's like you're saying, you know, one thing I was like, why did Homer just tell everyone?

756
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,120
Scott: Well, they explained to you in episode 10.

757
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,739
Scott: She's tried that.

758
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,398
Scott: It didn't work.

759
00:35:59,764 --> 00:36:00,455
Rym: But also, why?

760
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,480
Scott: How does she know the Westburg is night is coming?

761
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,077
Scott: Well, Pergus.

762
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,400
Scott: Yeah.

763
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,540
Scott: While Pergus night is coming.

764
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,260
Scott: Well, because it comes at the same time.

765
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:15,300
Rym: But also, I like how in the worlds where Madoka is a magical girl, she is super competent and she's also like a really strong person.

766
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,500
Rym: Like the time when they beat the witch, but the two of them are laying there dying.

767
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:24,480
Rym: Madoka whips out the grief seed she hidden that she still has and taps it on Homer's soul gem before she could even react.

768
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:24,889
Scott: Yep.

769
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,440
Scott: Well, I mean, that's another thing, right?

770
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Scott: In the very first universe of episode 10, right, Homura is the weak, timid one.

771
00:36:32,622 --> 00:36:34,059
Scott: And Madoka is just like, hey, what's up?

772
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,000
Rym: Yeah, Madoka, Mami, Sayaka are all just magical girls together.

773
00:36:37,121 --> 00:36:39,059
Rym: And I like how Kyoko joins them on the team.

774
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:40,039
Rym: Like they're all just chill.

775
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:40,491
Scott: Yeah.

776
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:54,360
Scott: But then in the, you know, the universe that most of the show takes place in, you know, the current timeline against the final timeline, the real one, you know, Madoka is a little bit timid, not super timid, but a little bit, you know, where Homura is the ultimate.

777
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,860
Rym: But at the same time, she seems strong.

778
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,000
Rym: Like she you get this sense, like there's almost this boy in her life.

779
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,100
Scott: She is her mom's daughter.

780
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,799
Scott: Her mom is the best.

781
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:08,399
Rym: Not just that, but there's there's a million universes or at least a thousand or so where she is a magical girl hero.

782
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:12,080
Rym: In one of them, she takes out that Walpurgis Night Witch with one shot.

783
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:14,360
Scott: And then becomes the biggest witch ever.

784
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:21,680
Rym: But think about all those universes are like tugging at her soul and her being as her being a hero in every sense.

785
00:37:21,821 --> 00:37:23,600
Rym: And now she's just a normal girl.

786
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:25,600
Rym: In fact, there's someone trying to prevent her from being the hero.

787
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,839
Rym: Yeah, I really like Mommy, too.

788
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,919
Rym: She had this kind of otherworldly.

789
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,460
Rym: She reminded me of the Outer Senshi from Sailor Moon a lot.

790
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,020
Scott: Well, it's always kind of weird, right?

791
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,080
Scott: Because it's like you're trying to judge, you know, you sort of have this thing in your brain, like who's good and who's bad.

792
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:39,541
Scott: Right.

793
00:37:40,064 --> 00:37:44,063
Scott: And it's like, well, Mommy, on the one hand was like, yeah, becoming magical girl.

794
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:46,060
Scott: She was like trying to make them become magical girls.

795
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,120
Scott: But you sort of had a sense the cuba was evil.

796
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,459
Scott: So you're like, is Mommy evil?

797
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,540
Rym: But no, Mommy really believed in all this.

798
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,440
Rym: Mommy was a really good person.

799
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:53,963
Scott: Yeah.

800
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:56,700
Scott: But it's like but she was still trying to get them to become magical girls.

801
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:02,688
Scott: But Homura seemed like she was up to no good, at least on the very surface, seemed like she was up to no good.

802
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:04,640
Scott: But you knew she was actually right.

803
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,534
Rym: Sayaka was the saddest, though, because she went like.

804
00:38:07,554 --> 00:38:10,460
Rym: she's the one who came into this with kind of the most good intentions.

805
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:15,000
Rym: And it's interesting how that always ended up the worst possible outcome.

806
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,205
Rym: Yeah.

807
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:18,559
Scott: She also didn't use her wish very well.

808
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:25,182
Scott: She was there to show you like the typical, you know, what I imagine what most magical girls think.

809
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:32,220
Rym: that was typical, because look at when you get the flashback to how Mommy decided she's dying, bleeding to death after having been in a car accident.

810
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,560
Rym: And Kyubey appears like, hey, you can wish to not die.

811
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,241
Scott: Yeah.

812
00:38:36,906 --> 00:38:38,720
Rym: Sayaka is one of the few people who had a choice.

813
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:39,641
Scott: Yeah.

814
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:43,660
Scott: But if you look, Kyoko also had a similar wish.

815
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,428
Rym: And she had a pretty epic wish.

816
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:47,460
Rym: that again, despair and hope.

817
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:49,940
Scott: No, those those wishes weren't, you know, epic.

818
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,540
Scott: I mean, wishing to not die is something you can understand in the heat of the moment.

819
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,545
Scott: But but think about it.

820
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,540
Rym: Kyoko and Sayaka both had an alternate thing.

821
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,340
Scott: They were thinking, I wish for X, but their wishes are still just sort of in the context of their existing lives.

822
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,780
Scott: They were in the context of the grand scheme of the universe.

823
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,763
Rym: They didn't need to be, because as far as they could see, the grand scheme of things once was.

824
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:12,980
Rym: I also will become a magical girl and protect people from this evil.

825
00:39:13,261 --> 00:39:13,563
Scott: Yeah.

826
00:39:13,966 --> 00:39:15,840
Rym: I mean, that's a pretty great thing to be Madoka.

827
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:16,919
Scott: What did she want to wish for?

828
00:39:17,082 --> 00:39:17,998
Scott: She wanted to be a magical girl.

829
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,510
Rym: Yeah, I thought that originally.

830
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,960
Rym: I thought that was why she was the most powerful.

831
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,840
Scott: I thought it was bad subtitles the first time.

832
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,960
Rym: I thought she was going to wish to be a magical girl and somehow that was going to break Qubei's bullshit.

833
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:28,768
Scott: That would be weird.

834
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:30,060
Rym: That was my early guess.

835
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:30,802
Scott: Yeah.

836
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:33,540
Rym: I really didn't trust Qubei from the start.

837
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,380
Scott: Well, you can't after you see Bokerano.

838
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,524
Scott: There's no way you trust any weird creature that's trying to get people to sign contracts.

839
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,380
Scott: Seriously, the first time I watched the show.

840
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,579
Scott: You know it's a trap.

841
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,040
Rym: Qubei, like I was a little unsure.

842
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:56,480
Rym: The second time through, like it is so painfully obvious how much of a dick is the one ending where Madoka becomes the like the most powerful witch in the world to destroy the earth in about 10 days.

843
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,160
Rym: And Qubei is like, well, that's your problem now.

844
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,540
Scott: We finished our energy quota.

845
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,082
Scott: See you.

846
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:07,610
Scott: Yeah, it has that typical sci fi thing with, you know, the aliens gathering energy from whatever it's like.

847
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,622
Scott: that was sort of black, but at least it didn't play a big part.

848
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:11,386
Rym: No, no, because it was.

849
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:14,784
Rym: it was much like it's a tiny spoiler, but it is very tiny.

850
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:16,360
Rym: But it's a very similar plot.

851
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,020
Rym: And I like the fact that both of these shows edge into this territory, much like how we bebop at the gate disaster of here's the world.

852
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:31,538
Rym: The main characters exist in this world and have a huge plot, but simultaneously there are things that are beyond their reach.

853
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:33,599
Scott: Yeah, the universe is vast.

854
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:39,519
Scott: You're tiny and insignificant, you know, even though you're not tiny and significant in the scope of this anime.

855
00:40:39,681 --> 00:40:41,294
Scott: In the universe.

856
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:42,040
Rym: But think about this.

857
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:52,183
Rym: I love at the end in the kind of remade world where Homer is feeding Qubei and she's the only one who remembers Madoka and she's kind of tossing the stuff in the air and Qubei is being all cute.

858
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:55,440
Rym: And he's like, this witch's thing sounds really intriguing.

859
00:40:55,861 --> 00:40:59,320
Rym: I wonder if we could do use it to do something to make more energy.

860
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,385
Rym: And she's like, yeah, you dick.

861
00:41:01,531 --> 00:41:04,003
Rym: I have a feeling our relationship would be much more treacherous.

862
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:07,039
Rym: Yeah, that was just a nice touch at the end.

863
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:07,842
Scott: It was.

864
00:41:07,862 --> 00:41:13,140
Rym: I was driven to tears many times, pretty much from episode 10 to the end.

865
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,440
Scott: Well, I think that's by design.

866
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,600
Scott: The end was epic to an amazing degree.

867
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,720
Rym: Remember way back when Qubei was like, you could even be an omnipotent God.

868
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,640
Scott: And I kind of like how that it's like she didn't wish to be an omnipotent God.

869
00:41:25,741 --> 00:41:27,980
Scott: It was just sort of like, well, you're going to become an omnipotent God.

870
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,828
Scott: She's like, that's fine.

871
00:41:28,908 --> 00:41:30,020
Rym: But it's very important.

872
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:32,912
Rym: She could have wished to get rid of the like.

873
00:41:32,932 --> 00:41:35,406
Rym: just destroy magical girls like there are no magical girls.

874
00:41:35,548 --> 00:41:36,699
Rym: Everyone leads a normal life.

875
00:41:37,382 --> 00:41:37,984
Rym: But I like how.

876
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:43,863
Rym: instead she went epic because if magical girls still exist, then miracles still exist.

877
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:47,998
Rym: And that was the whole thing with Sayaka, the fact that she dies.

878
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:56,724
Rym: that time, that timeline in the final remade world is basically Homura, Mami, Sayaka and Kyoko being magical girls.

879
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,900
Rym: Sayaka dies, but gets her wish.

880
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:02,278
Rym: And that was very touching to me.

881
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:05,380
Scott: I don't think she even really existed in that timeline.

882
00:42:05,886 --> 00:42:06,999
Rym: I think she did.

883
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:14,079
Scott: And I think because she was like, look, you know, it seemed like because he watched when Madoka was like saving all the magical girls.

884
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:14,906
Scott: No, no, no.

885
00:42:14,926 --> 00:42:16,340
Scott: Because some of them disappeared.

886
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:22,459
Rym: No, because, you know, when she was saving them, those were the magical girls who were going to turn who turned into witches in the past.

887
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:32,913
Rym: Every magical girl throughout all of history who had turned into a witch, she intervened in time the moment before they became a witch and spared them that by taking all of the grief into herself.

888
00:42:33,116 --> 00:42:33,298
Rym: Yeah.

889
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:35,330
Rym: Sayaka, because remember, there are.

890
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:38,003
Scott: but she was like, you know, your own circular logic, whatever.

891
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:40,920
Rym: No, but Sayaka, she got her wish.

892
00:42:41,182 --> 00:42:42,279
Rym: The boy was healed.

893
00:42:42,442 --> 00:42:43,539
Rym: So that miracle did happen.

894
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:44,083
Rym: It did.

895
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:46,680
Scott: But I don't think, you know, I think they may be in that time.

896
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,202
Rym: No, it was clear it did, because think about two of the universes where everything ends up badly.

897
00:42:52,623 --> 00:43:00,038
Rym: In one of them, Sayaka becomes a witch and Kyoko kills herself to spare Sayaka the fate of continuing to be a witch.

898
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:07,760
Rym: In one of the flashback ones, the same thing happens and Mami freaks out and kills Kyoko and then Madoka has to like in some of them.

899
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,499
Scott: Sayaka wasn't even there, though, at all.

900
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,487
Rym: Well, no, she we didn't.

901
00:43:10,992 --> 00:43:11,820
Rym: That was earlier.

902
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,359
Rym: Sayaka doesn't become a magical girl till later.

903
00:43:15,103 --> 00:43:16,640
Rym: And we don't see those scenes from later.

904
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:23,680
Rym: I think she's a part of the team in most of those universes, though maybe I can see Homura preventing that, trying to save her and eventually.

905
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,519
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure that there was some time she was.

906
00:43:26,543 --> 00:43:35,440
Rym: The fact that Homura in the second most recent end was constantly telling Madoka, give up on Sayaka, give up on her, because she just knows this.

907
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,540
Scott: Basically, she's like, yeah, there's nothing you can do about Sayaka.

908
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,400
Rym: That implies to me that she's seen Sayaka die a zillion times.

909
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,287
Rym: She tried to pull.

910
00:43:42,307 --> 00:43:43,540
Rym: She tried to save the hobo.

911
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:50,360
Scott: And she also wasn't upset about Mami dying so early in episode three, because that was a much better fate than Mami later.

912
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,540
Scott: Yeah, because she had seen what Mami usually ends up doing much later on.

913
00:43:54,620 --> 00:44:01,404
Rym: Yes, Mami dying is much better for Mami than Mami becoming a witch or Mami killing Kyoko.

914
00:44:01,565 --> 00:44:04,420
Rym: Yeah, because she needed Kyoko in case she had to fight Walpurgis night.

915
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,090
Rym: Yeah, but Sayaka, she got.

916
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:11,480
Scott: I think it was just that your plan was like, well, this time let's try getting Kyoko to the end.

917
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,020
Scott: But not only did Sayaka get her wish, it's like playing a video game this time.

918
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,421
Rym: Let's try this.

919
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:27,020
Rym: When Homura wakes up in the new universe, the scene she wakes up in is everyone except Madoka, who is not in that universe, being said that they couldn't save Sayaka, that she died.

920
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,340
Rym: And the only difference, Homura is the only one who knows Madoka.

921
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,600
Rym: So that is why I believe in this final universe, everything Sayaka did still happened, except no witches.

922
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:37,180
Rym: She just died.

923
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,001
Scott: Maybe.

924
00:44:38,222 --> 00:44:41,399
Scott: Either way, what else are we going to say about the show?

925
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,520
Scott: The fact that some of my favorite scenes in the show, right?

926
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,860
Scott: So where she's fighting the Walpurgis night and she does all the crazy explosions.

927
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,619
Rym: That is Neo guns times ten.

928
00:44:53,060 --> 00:45:06,840
Scott: So she does the rocket launchers, the scene with the time stop in the universe, she does the mortars, then she does the bus off the bridge, then she does it falls into the pit with the C4 all around when the C4 turns on.

929
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,839
Scott: It's like shit, son.

930
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:15,940
Rym: I like when she comes back the first time and she's going to fix everything and she shows off her powers and mommy's like, oh, it's clearly time stop.

931
00:45:16,362 --> 00:45:19,120
Scott: Yeah, she's that was a good line, at least in this.

932
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,560
Scott: I don't know how I think the subtitles were a little janky, a little bit.

933
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,340
Rym: Emily was correcting them a lot while we were watching.

934
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:24,522
Scott: Yeah.

935
00:45:24,643 --> 00:45:32,280
Scott: Another scene I really liked actually was when the teacher and the mom were talking, getting that was cool because that was unexpected.

936
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,089
Scott: But because early in the show, you know, the very first episode, the mom asks about the teacher.

937
00:45:37,396 --> 00:45:37,600
Scott: Right.

938
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:44,280
Scott: And Madoka's talk is, you know, the teacher and the mom know each other and have some sort of relationship, even though it's hardly explored at all.

939
00:45:44,601 --> 00:45:45,385
Scott: But it's still.

940
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:45,727
Scott: it's like.

941
00:45:45,747 --> 00:45:48,360
Scott: that's why they're talking to each other in that later episode.

942
00:45:48,902 --> 00:45:49,727
Scott: And the mom is still.

943
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,439
Scott: the mom is just so awesome all the time.

944
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:55,040
Scott: And that scene where like the mom is like, Madoka, stay with you.

945
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,560
Scott: And I'm like, oh, yeah, take the mom with you.

946
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,407
Scott: That'll be sweet.

947
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:58,900
Rym: I was really hoping the mom would go with her.

948
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,379
Scott: Yeah, I was like, oh, I thought something was going to happen there.

949
00:46:01,701 --> 00:46:03,520
Scott: Yeah, but no, it was just like, all right.

950
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:09,319
Rym: But even then, that I really you know, that was Madoka being the strong character from every other universe really coming out.

951
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,040
Rym: Yeah, I really like the mom's advice of sometimes you have to do the wrong thing.

952
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,260
Scott: That was a good one, too.

953
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,226
Scott: And it's like, I like.

954
00:46:15,246 --> 00:46:18,600
Scott: the way the thing was is I was like, oh, I can't wait to see what wrong thing she does.

955
00:46:18,924 --> 00:46:20,100
Scott: And then I stopped thinking about it.

956
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,400
Scott: And then she did the wrong thing immediately.

957
00:46:21,641 --> 00:46:23,900
Scott: The size and it was the wrongest thing.

958
00:46:24,021 --> 00:46:24,844
Scott: It was really wrong.

959
00:46:24,864 --> 00:46:28,962
Scott: But it was also advantageous because it allowed them to learn something.

960
00:46:28,982 --> 00:46:29,384
Scott: Right.

961
00:46:29,444 --> 00:46:35,600
Scott: It was that in this universe, the fact that all those magical girls learned that in that universe, I think was a key.

962
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,820
Rym: Well, look what it did in that universe that mommy doesn't exist anymore.

963
00:46:38,961 --> 00:46:39,906
Rym: So she well, she's dead.

964
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:41,675
Rym: So she won't go crazy and kill people.

965
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:42,539
Rym: when she figures it out.

966
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,400
Rym: Sayaka learns and Kyoko no longer is trying to kill Sayaka.

967
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:55,923
Scott: But no, see, mommy went crazy and killed everyone in that other in that old universe when she learned that they turn into witches, not when she learns that the soul gem is actually you.

968
00:46:56,124 --> 00:47:00,284
Rym: But I wonder if she might have figured it out, because I feel like she was.

969
00:47:00,304 --> 00:47:01,820
Scott: there were both things that pissed them off.

970
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:09,520
Rym: Mommy was very, I don't know, canny about everything and very of course, this kind of aside, I like how she was so otherworldly and so calm all the time.

971
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,999
Rym: But yet in the flashbacks, you see what causes her to break down.

972
00:47:13,781 --> 00:47:18,966
Rym: And in the real show, the one time when Motoko is like, I won't forget you, I'll fight with you.

973
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:20,100
Rym: And that was going to be her wish.

974
00:47:20,622 --> 00:47:22,840
Rym: How happy mommy was and how she breaks down.

975
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,504
Scott: She was crying.

976
00:47:23,544 --> 00:47:25,720
Scott: Her whole family was dead in whatever accident.

977
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,986
Scott: She was the only one who survived.

978
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:30,805
Scott: She lived alone, you know, as a magical girl, whatever, you know.

979
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:32,780
Scott: So it's just a lonely existence.

980
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:38,043
Scott: But she was a good person trying to help people just happen to be a very lonely life.

981
00:47:38,485 --> 00:47:43,620
Rym: But of course, watching the show and having people have said things like, yeah, it's like Boca Rado with magical girls.

982
00:47:44,082 --> 00:47:45,620
Rym: As soon as she said, I'm so happy.

983
00:47:45,942 --> 00:47:47,080
Rym: All I could think was she's going to die.

984
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:47,723
Rym: She's going to die.

985
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:52,873
Scott: She's going to die there for as much as this show kept things a secret and had good, you know, you didn't.

986
00:47:53,094 --> 00:47:54,040
Scott: things you couldn't expect.

987
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,902
Scott: There are plenty of things you could see coming a mile away that you are trained in the anime.

988
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:03,779
Rym: that led to one of my favorite scenes, which is just Motoko and Sayaka sitting on the roof afterward.

989
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:08,239
Rym: And their conversation is basically we've been bilboed.

990
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:09,277
Rym: There's no way back.

991
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,640
Scott: Yeah, but it was also, yeah, I guess we're not going to become magical girls.

992
00:48:13,484 --> 00:48:14,660
Rym: But it wasn't really.

993
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,400
Rym: They didn't really say they're not going to do it.

994
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,143
Rym: They were really they.

995
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:18,792
Rym: that was.

996
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,160
Rym: they said that because that was the logical thing.

997
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:24,959
Rym: But it was obvious that both of them were still considering it like they couldn't just walk away from that world.

998
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:25,341
Scott: Yeah.

999
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:34,800
Scott: There I mean, there were just so many other good scenes, both short and long, like when Madoka is about to finally become a magical girl and then you make a shot.

1000
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,201
Rym: Yep.

1001
00:48:35,422 --> 00:48:35,663
Rym: Yeah.

1002
00:48:35,723 --> 00:48:43,020
Rym: I like in the flashbacks the one where she's already killed Akibe and yet there's already another one like on his way after Madoka.

1003
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:43,601
Rym: Yeah.

1004
00:48:44,244 --> 00:48:44,786
Scott: And it's like that's.

1005
00:48:44,847 --> 00:48:48,948
Scott: another thing is like the show is called Puella Magi Madoka Magica in the opener.

1006
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:50,780
Scott: It's all Madoka as a magical girl.

1007
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,940
Rym: Yet she's not a magical girl until the end.

1008
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:00,600
Scott: You start you start watching the show and the first conflict they introduce within a minute is is Madoka to become a magical girl or not?

1009
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:03,918
Scott: She can be formed this contract, but she was just told not to.

1010
00:49:04,462 --> 00:49:05,780
Scott: Is is she going to do it?

1011
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,582
Scott: If so, when?

1012
00:49:06,603 --> 00:49:15,924
Scott: And I was assuming the first time I watched it, that within a few episodes she would do it and make some wish and the rest of the show would be about the conflicts that happen after.

1013
00:49:15,944 --> 00:49:20,025
Scott: I didn't think that that would be the conflict of the whole show, even though it was a short show.

1014
00:49:20,045 --> 00:49:22,520
Scott: I didn't think that would be the 12 episode conflict.

1015
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,046
Scott: But in fact, it was.

1016
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:27,640
Scott: she doesn't become a magical girl until episode 12.

1017
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,714
Scott: It's like, come on.

1018
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,800
Scott: Though pursuant to that, I did not expect that would be like insane.

1019
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,735
Scott: I'd be like, if in Sailor Moon, you didn't say whatever her name is, Usagi.

1020
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,620
Scott: Usagi didn't become Sailor Moon until the final episode of Sailor Moon.

1021
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,079
Rym: One of them said, I almost said Serena.

1022
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:44,861
Scott: Right.

1023
00:49:45,323 --> 00:49:53,420
Scott: Or if you watched, you know, Princess Tutu and it was just a duck and Ahiru until the very final episode, Princess Tutu, you know, you've never seen that happen.

1024
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,706
Scott: This is the transformation.

1025
00:49:54,726 --> 00:49:58,318
Scott: Voltron didn't form into the complete Voltron until the very last episode of Voltron.

1026
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,660
Rym: Well, Shinji didn't form into a complete man until the very end.

1027
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:01,960
Scott: Right.

1028
00:50:01,981 --> 00:50:05,819
Scott: Imagine if like Ava zero one didn't even activate until episode twenty six.

1029
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:07,418
Scott: You know, that's what this is.

1030
00:50:08,103 --> 00:50:08,909
Scott: You know, it's crazy.

1031
00:50:09,776 --> 00:50:10,260
Scott: Unbelievable.

1032
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,020
Scott: No one's ever had the boss do something like that before.

1033
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,880
Rym: Oh, so I like the scene when Sayaka is like, I don't know about this time spot.

1034
00:50:17,062 --> 00:50:17,365
Rym: Stop.

1035
00:50:17,466 --> 00:50:18,719
Rym: All she does is drop bombs.

1036
00:50:18,963 --> 00:50:20,160
Rym: I'm the only close in fighter.

1037
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,518
Rym: It's kind of dangerous for me.

1038
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,061
Scott: Yeah.

1039
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:23,899
Scott: They were sort of practically the next.

1040
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:24,561
Scott: It's true.

1041
00:50:24,602 --> 00:50:24,883
Scott: That's like.

1042
00:50:24,923 --> 00:50:26,271
Scott: that's the reveal everything.

1043
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:28,202
Scott: episode, episode 10, the reveal everything.

1044
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:32,122
Scott: Groundhog Day episode, and somehow they're managing to fit into that episode.

1045
00:50:32,624 --> 00:50:36,380
Scott: Pretty straightforward, like tactical magical girl fighting discussions.

1046
00:50:36,941 --> 00:50:42,959
Rym: The show, if you just look at this show, you see five magical girls who fit the stereotypes of a magical girl team.

1047
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:48,480
Rym: And yet the entire show, there's no hint of that magical girl team except the opener.

1048
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:58,900
Rym: Until you get the flashback and also the and then the fact that at the end of the show and that episode 10, they play the opener to the show at the end.

1049
00:50:59,120 --> 00:50:59,201
Scott: Yeah.

1050
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,360
Scott: Episodes 10, 11 and 12.

1051
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,940
Scott: The closer is pretty much gone, right?

1052
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,859
Scott: They just play the opener.

1053
00:51:03,281 --> 00:51:05,332
Rym: That was brilliant because it's kind of like.

1054
00:51:05,372 --> 00:51:07,544
Rym: it's almost like a New Testament of magical girls.

1055
00:51:07,705 --> 00:51:10,100
Rym: You know, with her becoming a goddess is kind of true.

1056
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,940
Rym: It's like there's a new world order.

1057
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,220
Rym: There's a new contract.

1058
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:21,740
Scott: There is still bad things in the world, but the bad things are magical demons that come from the darkness and magical girls only bring good.

1059
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,560
Scott: They come and they fight for good and then they die.

1060
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:23,901
Rym: Yep.

1061
00:51:23,982 --> 00:51:25,580
Rym: And sometimes that was what I thought.

1062
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,322
Rym: I didn't expect.

1063
00:51:26,523 --> 00:51:40,260
Rym: until once I saw the grief seeds work, I suspected something bad with witches because notice how she takes the grief seed and she taps it against her soul gem and blackness comes out of the soul gem into the grief seed.

1064
00:51:40,742 --> 00:51:40,964
Rym: Yeah.

1065
00:51:41,005 --> 00:51:42,139
Rym: Think about how fucked up that is.

1066
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:49,520
Rym: That means that every one of those grief seeds is already the tormented soul of a former magical girl damned to this for eternity.

1067
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,019
Rym: But then they are doing they're killing them.

1068
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:53,147
Scott: That is sort of weird.

1069
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,580
Scott: It's like Cubase trying to get energy.

1070
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:55,022
Scott: Right.

1071
00:51:55,123 --> 00:51:58,200
Scott: But he gets the energy from the filled grief seeds.

1072
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,479
Scott: But he's that's what he collects in his ass.

1073
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:01,602
Scott: Right.

1074
00:52:02,064 --> 00:52:03,650
Scott: But he said that the energy is.

1075
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:05,417
Scott: it was it was I think.

1076
00:52:05,437 --> 00:52:07,858
Rym: he said the energy is released when they become a witch.

1077
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:12,678
Rym: So it's like in the Golden Compass, which you haven't read.

1078
00:52:13,203 --> 00:52:13,386
Rym: Yeah.

1079
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:14,299
Rym: Anyway, it's like that.

1080
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,660
Scott: But it's like, so why is he collecting these fill?

1081
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,082
Scott: I don't know.

1082
00:52:17,364 --> 00:52:19,600
Rym: I think he was collecting them just to put him back out in the world.

1083
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,422
Rym: Who knows?

1084
00:52:21,186 --> 00:52:32,366
Scott: But there was, you know, that's another thing is like every even every little thing can be explained, you know, like, well, if it takes a magical girl to become a witch, how come there's like, you know, it seems like there's plenty of witches for them to fight.

1085
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:34,360
Scott: Well, because witch fragments can happen.

1086
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,366
Scott: That's why this is.

1087
00:52:35,407 --> 00:52:37,360
Scott: That's how come there's such a great quantity of witches.

1088
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,300
Scott: Notice something even though there's way more witches than magical.

1089
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:47,914
Rym: Qubay says and a lot of them like Yoko knew this, that a fragment becomes a witch once it's killed.

1090
00:52:47,934 --> 00:52:48,015
Rym: Yeah.

1091
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,120
Rym: So Sayaka, I think, killed those guys on the train.

1092
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,242
Scott: Probably.

1093
00:52:53,464 --> 00:52:55,860
Rym: And the reason I think this is look at her as a witch.

1094
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,020
Rym: It's half the motif of her life.

1095
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,660
Rym: You know, Madoka and the boy and the music.

1096
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:03,739
Rym: The other half of the motif is trains.

1097
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:04,521
Scott: Yeah.

1098
00:53:04,823 --> 00:53:06,639
Rym: I mean, her weapon is the train wheels.

1099
00:53:07,762 --> 00:53:10,440
Scott: It's true, which they were sort of wagon wheels.

1100
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,760
Rym: Yeah, but they were also the trains going in the background.

1101
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:17,742
Rym: So I looked at all the other witches and every witch has two distinct elements together.

1102
00:53:17,843 --> 00:53:21,880
Rym: And I I am pretty sure the writers thought of that very tightly.

1103
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:22,906
Scott: It was very intentional.

1104
00:53:22,946 --> 00:53:34,360
Scott: The style of every witch was representing, you know, something very specific and essentially episode 10 where there's like a whole ton of witches because you see like the one that's on the clotheslines and all kinds of.

1105
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:34,965
Rym: Oh, yeah.

1106
00:53:35,248 --> 00:53:37,819
Scott: You know, it was like it was like a feast of witches.

1107
00:53:38,824 --> 00:53:40,100
Rym: It also had that old anime thing.

1108
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,780
Scott: It was almost fan service because like witches.

1109
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:47,140
Rym: The Groundhog Day reveals had the other big part of not just Groundhog Day, but Cleopatra.

1110
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,081
Scott: Yeah.

1111
00:53:48,102 --> 00:53:49,028
Scott: Well, that was actually.

1112
00:53:49,068 --> 00:53:50,840
Scott: you saw that in episode nine, really.

1113
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,181
Scott: Yeah.

1114
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:54,800
Rym: But once you get all of that, that's a lot like Ursa and Sura too.

1115
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:58,920
Rym: When at the end, the dream eaters like all throughout history, Adolf Hitler.

1116
00:53:59,203 --> 00:53:59,689
Rym: That was me.

1117
00:53:59,709 --> 00:53:59,831
Rym: Yeah.

1118
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:06,419
Scott: I like that kind of shit because it ties it in, you know, even though it's a future world, it ties it to the real world somehow.

1119
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:11,503
Rym: But seriously, how many shows have the main character in the end wishing to become a god?

1120
00:54:11,986 --> 00:54:14,619
Rym: And that actually happens and that is the end.

1121
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:15,401
Scott: Yeah.

1122
00:54:15,421 --> 00:54:15,563
Scott: Right.

1123
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,900
Scott: Well, she didn't wish to become a god.

1124
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:22,464
Scott: She wished that magical girl that there were no there were no witches and that she would destroy all the.

1125
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:34,279
Rym: she wished that she would destroy every witch that had ever been and ever would be, which immediately implied that she would take all the grief of the world into herself.

1126
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:34,683
Rym: Yeah.

1127
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:36,459
Scott: And then she makes a gigantic soul gem.

1128
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,782
Rym: So think about this.

1129
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:44,540
Rym: She is now basically a goddess who can who has all the grief of the world and all the hope of the world in herself.

1130
00:54:45,121 --> 00:54:52,180
Rym: She doles out the hope through magical girls and she doles out the grief as demons for the magical girls to fight.

1131
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:58,120
Scott: And there's that one really quick thing that you that you have to really you know, it's it's sort of quick, but you have to really pay attention to it.

1132
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:01,599
Scott: In episode 12, where she did the giant, you see the giant soul gem.

1133
00:55:01,961 --> 00:55:02,123
Scott: Right.

1134
00:55:02,163 --> 00:55:04,220
Scott: And it's like, oh, she's collected all the despair.

1135
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:07,480
Scott: And also all the, you know, the hope all at once.

1136
00:55:07,961 --> 00:55:13,779
Scott: And then it's like, well, you know, and then there's like the giant witch with like the sun moon face that grabs the whole earth.

1137
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:14,242
Scott: Yeah.

1138
00:55:14,323 --> 00:55:17,419
Scott: And then she's like, well, no, if my witch comes true, I kill this one, too.

1139
00:55:17,801 --> 00:55:18,124
Scott: Yeah.

1140
00:55:18,347 --> 00:55:19,539
Scott: And she holds that one, too.

1141
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:31,000
Rym: I like how even Cubase, like when when she makes the witch, it's like the almost the first time when I almost detected a slight bit of consternation on his part.

1142
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:34,459
Rym: He's like, ah, this might not be good.

1143
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,060
Scott: Yeah.

1144
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:40,647
Rym: That was really touching, though, when I like a homeroom remembers her, which is very important.

1145
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,240
Scott: And the whole the whole ribbon thing.

1146
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:42,926
Rym: Yeah, the ribbon thing.

1147
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:44,200
Rym: And then the little brother.

1148
00:55:44,361 --> 00:55:47,800
Scott: And she talks to Madoka's mom, the best character in the show.

1149
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:48,304
Rym: Yeah.

1150
00:55:49,011 --> 00:55:50,040
Scott: That was just really touching.

1151
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,960
Scott: If there's any girls out there who are like Madoka's mom, call me.

1152
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:53,461
Rym: There are.

1153
00:55:53,682 --> 00:55:53,943
Rym: Yeah.

1154
00:55:54,124 --> 00:56:01,900
Rym: I mean, she has a lot of the aspects of characters like that we've liked, but she also has responsibility.

1155
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:02,601
Rym: Yeah.

1156
00:56:03,705 --> 00:56:08,505
Rym: I mean, in Ava, we may have liked certain characters, but they were not the most responsible.

1157
00:56:08,545 --> 00:56:15,520
Scott: That's actually, you know, Madoka's mom is like a grown up, a more grown up Masato who is not crazy and doesn't really have emotional problems.

1158
00:56:15,741 --> 00:56:18,820
Scott: That's exactly what she's like, has the same kind of personality and hotness.

1159
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,081
Scott: Right.

1160
00:56:19,101 --> 00:56:22,919
Scott: She's you know, they both have really important positions in big organizations.

1161
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,697
Rym: Like, why don't you become the CEO?

1162
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,321
Rym: And she's like, huh, well, if I get Baldy out of the way and I do this, I like that action.

1163
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:30,803
Scott: That was good.

1164
00:56:31,405 --> 00:56:36,263
Rym: And just that scene again where her mom confronts her, like, you know what's up.

1165
00:56:36,443 --> 00:56:42,400
Rym: And Madoka puts on her adult face, which really harkens back to the scene where, you know, her mom's drinking whiskey at night.

1166
00:56:42,802 --> 00:56:46,020
Rym: And she's like and Madoka is like, I really want to drink whiskey with you someday, mom.

1167
00:56:46,242 --> 00:56:48,038
Rym: And the mom's like, you should go for it.

1168
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:52,400
Rym: Growing up is kind of sucks, but it's also kind of fun.

1169
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,560
Rym: And that's kind of my sentiment.

1170
00:56:54,261 --> 00:56:58,740
Rym: But then when she tells her mom, like, I have to do this and her mom is like, I trust you.

1171
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,465
Rym: And she lets her go.

1172
00:56:59,545 --> 00:56:59,807
Rym: That was.

1173
00:57:00,009 --> 00:57:01,580
Rym: you never see that in anime.

1174
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:12,818
Scott: And in the mom, even they even said like sensible things, the kind of sensible things you don't hear, which is like, let the firefighters hit, you know, because as far as the mom didn't know, as well, Pergus Knight, the mom thought it was, you know, a tsunami, not

1175
00:57:12,878 --> 00:57:15,740
Rym: a tsunami, which basically fucks everything up.

1176
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,439
Scott: They thought it was just a really big typhoon.

1177
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:22,660
Rym: They didn't think it was just little things like when Kyoko is like, how do you know while Pergus Knight is going to be there this time?

1178
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,659
Rym: She's like, statistics.

1179
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:24,929
Scott: Yeah, right.

1180
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:25,600
Rym: She's really funny.

1181
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,503
Scott: She's bullshitting.

1182
00:57:27,106 --> 00:57:30,487
Rym: Well, you know, you could argue with statistics 100 percent of my sample.

1183
00:57:30,689 --> 00:57:31,420
Scott: Yeah, right.

1184
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,679
Scott: Well, Pergus Knight always fucking shows up every goddamn time.

1185
00:57:35,761 --> 00:57:37,180
Scott: I don't know what else is there to say.

1186
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,120
Rym: There's so much, but I love this show.

1187
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,180
Scott: We could probably talk for a long time.

1188
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:50,160
Rym: I guess the difference between this and a show like Utena or Big O season two is that while there's so much to it, it was very straightforward.

1189
00:57:50,323 --> 00:57:51,380
Rym: Like the plot at the end.

1190
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,180
Rym: There's no loose ends for us to really have to like rationalize.

1191
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:58,740
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't one of those, you know, while it had the same sort of mood as an Ava.

1192
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:00,940
Rym: What's the real life moral of this show?

1193
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:06,040
Scott: The real life moral of this show is that you shouldn't give up hope, obviously.

1194
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:06,943
Scott: Right.

1195
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:09,940
Rym: Or that you should draw hope from despair.

1196
00:58:10,401 --> 00:58:10,622
Rym: There is.

1197
00:58:10,743 --> 00:58:16,400
Rym: if there is a balance of hope and despair in the world, then the more despair you have, the more hope you need to have.

1198
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:16,701
Scott: Yeah.

1199
00:58:16,741 --> 00:58:19,460
Scott: But also right when you hope for something right.

1200
00:58:19,882 --> 00:58:21,187
Scott: You know, it's also to be careful.

1201
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:27,140
Rym: if you hope for something too much, you'll build despair in yourself as it becomes increasingly impossible.

1202
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:27,460
Scott: Yeah.

1203
00:58:27,501 --> 00:58:33,099
Scott: But also, if you hope that something might happen, that thing happening might, you know, be the thing you hope for.

1204
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,480
Scott: It might be great for you, but also might not be great for someone else.

1205
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:37,686
Scott: You know, it's like.

1206
00:58:38,049 --> 00:58:39,300
Scott: I really hope X happens.

1207
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,480
Scott: OK, X happened.

1208
00:58:41,423 --> 00:58:41,484
Scott: Yay.

1209
00:58:41,705 --> 00:58:44,200
Scott: But that X happening makes someone else sad.

1210
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,800
Rym: Case in point, Kyoko's wish.

1211
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:46,544
Scott: Right.

1212
00:58:46,665 --> 00:58:48,860
Rym: That was when I figured out that magical girls become witches.

1213
00:58:49,621 --> 00:58:59,103
Rym: Because when she was describing what happened to her and why she became a magical girl and, you know, the horrible consequences that was told through a puppet show that looked just like a witch.

1214
00:58:59,163 --> 00:59:02,133
Scott: Yeah, I was like, oh, which is another?

1215
00:59:02,153 --> 00:59:04,582
Scott: the sub moral, like the moral of psycho.

1216
00:59:04,643 --> 00:59:04,864
Scott: is that?

1217
00:59:04,884 --> 00:59:05,548
Scott: like she made it.

1218
00:59:05,628 --> 00:59:07,560
Scott: she made the wish, you know, to heal the kid.

1219
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:15,280
Scott: But it was like, did you actually just want him to be better or did you want to be the one to make him better?

1220
00:59:15,381 --> 00:59:15,663
Scott: Right.

1221
00:59:15,704 --> 00:59:17,559
Scott: And it's like it's not the same day.

1222
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,039
Rym: Well, Qme says that straight up, even he's like, hey, you sure?

1223
00:59:22,823 --> 00:59:26,288
Rym: I love how mommy's like, well, if you want to be a magical girl anyway, at least wish for some cake.

1224
00:59:26,652 --> 00:59:27,219
Scott: Yeah, right.

1225
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,980
Rym: It'd be a really good cake.

1226
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:31,080
Scott: And then it was cake right away.

1227
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:31,966
Scott: The witch was cake.

1228
00:59:32,147 --> 00:59:33,780
Scott: Yeah, it was the cake witch.

1229
00:59:35,702 --> 00:59:40,360
Scott: I like how when you fight the witches, that weird witch's name appears in some weird font that you're not supposed to read.

1230
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,205
Rym: That was really cool.

1231
00:59:41,406 --> 00:59:42,191
Scott: And it's just sort of like.

1232
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:46,460
Scott: it was just sort of like I think that's the kind of stuff like poking fanboys in the ribs, like poke poke.

1233
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:50,380
Rym: I was going to say I'm older now, but when I was younger, like that's the kind of stuff.

1234
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:51,220
Scott: That would have driven you nuts.

1235
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:51,601
Rym: I know.

1236
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:54,140
Rym: I would have been like I would have been comparing screencaps.

1237
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,640
Scott: You would have been going online to look up the names of all the witches.

1238
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,260
Rym: I mean, I did that with Ava the first time I watched it.

1239
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:02,278
Rym: I was like going frame by frame through the opener, like what's going on?

1240
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,959
Scott: What's the name of all the angels?

1241
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,499
Rym: Yeah, I was reading like like old Kabbalah stuff and looking at the tree of life and trying to figure it out.

1242
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,103
Scott: All right.

1243
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:11,700
Rym: I'm past that point in my life.

1244
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,121
Scott: Me too.

1245
01:00:13,266 --> 01:00:16,938
Scott: I can accept that they just wanted to use a stylistic font and make it, you know, names.

1246
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,160
Rym: But the thing is, I bet it is consistent.

1247
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,460
Rym: They probably did have some rationale behind it.

1248
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,980
Scott: I think they just made it look sort of like...

1249
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,674
Rym: No, no, because that's the best way to make a consistent universe.

1250
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:29,560
Rym: is you just figure out as a writer, like, all right, this is the real deal.

1251
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:34,687
Rym: Just so you know, like whenever you have a question like what would happen here, you can look at your real deal notes.

1252
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:43,020
Rym: and if you just follow your real deal notes as though that's the reality, all the stuff you add to the story as you write, even if the real deal notes are never in the story, will be consistent.

1253
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:43,592
Scott: Nah.

1254
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:46,319
Rym: And I'm pretty sure that people do stuff like that.

1255
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:47,560
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

1256
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:52,119
Rym: It's the kind of thing where if I had a studio, I'd take my like creative interns, I'd be like, "Design a witch.

1257
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,818
Rym: Just tell me why this person's a witch and we'll run with it from

1258
01:00:56,859 --> 01:00:56,999
Rym: there.".

1259
01:00:57,248 --> 01:00:57,354
Scott: Yeah.

1260
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:02,299
Rym: And the show, you don't need to reveal that, but it gives you a really interesting, consistent narrative.

1261
01:01:02,641 --> 01:01:02,958
Scott: It does.

1262
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:05,040
Rym: God, this show was awesome.

1263
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:05,999
Scott: It's a pretty good show.

1264
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,320
Scott: There's a lot, this is pretty good for 12 episodes, right?

1265
01:01:09,604 --> 01:01:09,800
Scott: Yeah.

1266
01:01:10,223 --> 01:01:11,920
Scott: What other show gets that much in 12 episodes?

1267
01:01:12,282 --> 01:01:12,939
Rym: I know, not many.

1268
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:14,639
Scott: Not any.

1269
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,036
Scott: I don't know.

1270
01:01:15,404 --> 01:01:16,055
Scott: I can't even think of one.

1271
01:01:17,863 --> 01:01:19,179
Scott: Maybe best 12 episode show.

1272
01:01:20,487 --> 01:01:21,040
Rym: I think we're done.

1273
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,600
Rym: I mean, I can't analyze it more because it's really straightforward.

1274
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:31,199
Rym: The interesting non-straightforward parts are really just the execution and the individual events.

1275
01:01:32,202 --> 01:01:37,920
Rym: After that whole scene we were talking about where Sokka's complaining about how she's, the bombs are dangerous to her as a close range fighter.

1276
01:01:38,441 --> 01:01:45,240
Rym: The next scene is that she's time stopped and she's walking through the Yakuza headquarters just stealing their pistols.

1277
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:54,214
Scott: And then she goes to the armory of the SDF and just takes all the guns and she sticks them all inside her little shield thingy.

1278
01:01:56,001 --> 01:01:56,980
Scott: That's another thing, right?

1279
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:04,000
Scott: She groundhog dayed all those times, but that means she lived to the end all those times.

1280
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:08,159
Scott: If she would have died in any one of those, she wouldn't have been able to use the time stop to go back.

1281
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,060
Rym: And she even got close in a few.

1282
01:02:10,301 --> 01:02:11,240
Rym: They were both dying.

1283
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:14,160
Scott: Yeah, you could tell she would have given up right there, that would have been it.

1284
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,920
Rym: But I didn't think about, you know, I kept thinking like, wow, she's kind of trapped.

1285
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,180
Rym: It's much like when I was a kid playing Final Fantasy 5.

1286
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,459
Scott: It's like, no, she has to make it because this isn't how it ends.

1287
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:22,940
Rym: Yep.

1288
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:29,028
Rym: But in Final Fantasy 5, I had the blue mage who had a power, he had a spell you could cast that would reset the battle.

1289
01:02:29,068 --> 01:02:32,499
Rym: you were in as though it hadn't happened, but you were still in the battle.

1290
01:02:33,361 --> 01:02:34,360
Rym: I was fighting the shield dragon.

1291
01:02:34,643 --> 01:02:36,540
Rym: I was not powerful enough to beat the shield dragon.

1292
01:02:37,065 --> 01:02:37,899
Rym: I had that spell.

1293
01:02:38,824 --> 01:02:39,798
Rym: I couldn't give up.

1294
01:02:40,732 --> 01:02:40,880
Scott: Right.

1295
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,460
Scott: You just kept resetting the battle and refighting the shield dragon.

1296
01:02:43,701 --> 01:02:44,259
Scott: And you know what?

1297
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,640
Scott: There was no chance of beating the shield dragon because you were not high level enough.

1298
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,579
Rym: After some, after like an hour and a half, I gave up.

1299
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:58,240
Scott: See what they should have done though and to fix Final Fantasy was you get experience even for the amount of the shield dragon you beat.

1300
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,698
Scott: But I'm saying, but again, if the blue, the blue mage would have died, you wouldn't be able to reset.

1301
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,980
Rym: Even after all these reveals, there's something I did not consider.

1302
01:03:07,102 --> 01:03:08,240
Rym: Like I should have considered it.

1303
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,719
Rym: I feel dumb for not having considered it.

1304
01:03:10,122 --> 01:03:13,120
Rym: But when Cubay was like, this is the, this is the last reality.

1305
01:03:13,944 --> 01:03:14,579
Rym: And I was like, what?

1306
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:25,777
Rym: And then when her soul gem is darkening and she's about to give up, I realized like, oh wait, yeah, she might eventually give up or she might be forced to because she'll become a witch.

1307
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:31,660
Scott: I mean, I don't think there was anything that like that was guaranteeing that that was the last chance, but I think you may figure it out.

1308
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:36,340
Scott: It was the last chance, but it's like, yeah, but Cubay was like, look, she's going to give up hope at some point and that will be the end.

1309
01:03:36,581 --> 01:03:40,020
Scott: And that just happened to be also be the time she was giving up hope.

1310
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:48,779
Rym: I just get the impression she tried like every combination of saving people and it was the Walpurgis Knight was the thing that really screwed it up other than the fact that they'd all become witches someday.

1311
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:56,373
Scott: But yeah, well because it's like if you have to fight a more powerful witch, you have to use all your magic to beat it, which means you're going to, that's going to be the end of you.

1312
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,719
Rym: And you know, I feel like Walpurgis Knight was by design Cubay.

1313
01:04:00,602 --> 01:04:10,100
Scott: I think it was actually more like it was, if you looked at the design of it, right, it was almost like a combination, like a bunch of witches had been combined together to make Walpurgis Knight.

1314
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:14,500
Scott: Like it attacks, it had like that whole group of dancing shadow girls around it.

1315
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,860
Scott: And it also had like it after she blew it up pretty good.

1316
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,920
Scott: It sent like three shadow girls flying after her at once.

1317
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:25,316
Scott: It was like Walpurgis Knight was almost like a witch army as opposed to just being one witch.

1318
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,560
Scott: It was just like one big witch in the middle of a witch army.

1319
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:29,400
Scott: I don't know.

1320
01:04:30,522 --> 01:04:30,920
Rym: All right.

1321
01:04:31,206 --> 01:04:31,840
Rym: I think we're done.

1322
01:04:32,061 --> 01:04:33,039
Scott: I think we've been long enough.

1323
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,620
Rym: It's not like Utena where we have the literary analysis.

1324
01:04:36,141 --> 01:04:37,499
Rym: So I love the show.

1325
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,800
Rym: And the thing is, I've already seen it twice.

1326
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:40,839
Rym: I can't watch it again.

1327
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,640
Scott: I can watch it again many years down the road.

1328
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,440
Scott: It's a show that hopefully someone else will make a show like this.

1329
01:04:47,722 --> 01:04:48,216
Rym: It's a show.

1330
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:54,678
Rym: It's one of those rare shows that I will buy because I want to own a copy of it to give to other people and say, hey, watch this.

1331
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:55,498
Scott: I don't know.

1332
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:57,279
Scott: It depends on how they sell it.

1333
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,600
Rym: Well, right now I've got a pirated set of 12 episodes.

1334
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:01,477
Scott: That's good enough.

1335
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:01,789
Scott: Enter HD.

1336
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:11,060
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1337
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:16,160
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.

1338
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:21,600
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1339
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,520
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1340
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,260
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1341
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,796
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1342
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:37,100
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1343
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:40,220
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
