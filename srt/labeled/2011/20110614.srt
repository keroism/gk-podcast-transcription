1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,367
Rym: It's Tuesday, June 14th, 2011.

2
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:13,748
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:14,370
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,933
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:18,960
Rym: Tonight, we've outcored ourselves into a corner.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,878
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,186
Rym: So did you go to the board game night on Friday?

8
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:35,380
Scott: No, I was at the Amazon Web Services Summit.

9
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:36,605
Scott: Ahh.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,939
Scott: I actually could have gone to the board game night, but I sort of forgot until just as I was leaving the summit, and then I was like, "I don't want to

11
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:44,160
Scott: go.".

12
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:45,525
Scott: So I went home.

13
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:49,220
Rym: Yeah, I was on the beach, and I probably would have gone to the board games otherwise.

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,570
Scott: Wasn't the weather sort of...

15
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:51,700
Rym: No, it was perfect.

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,984
Scott: Because up here it was bleh.

17
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,860
Rym: The weather was basically like Saturday, you know, we get up and it rains.

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:06,280
Rym: Like, pours and rains, and nobody goes to the beach, and then like an hour later, it totally clears up, and the water's warm, and the beach is empty, and it was just perfect beach weather for two days.

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,750
Scott: It was gray and bleh here.

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,140
Rym: Yep, you should have come to the beach.

21
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:10,285
Scott: I was busy.

22
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:11,894
Rym: Yeah, you could have come to the beach instead.

23
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:12,920
Rym: What were you busy doing?

24
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:17,400
Scott: I went to the... There was a huge barbecue situation in Madison Square Park.

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,486
Rym: Yeah, I had some.

26
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:19,394
Rym: I could have had barbecue.

27
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:20,039
Rym: I chose not to.

28
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,343
Scott: This barbecue.

29
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:26,629
Scott: Okay, so, you know, you go and you expect the barbecue to be like amazing, because they're like, "Oh, the pitmaster.

30
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,680
Scott: The great pitmasters are here," right?

31
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,885
Scott: And basically the way it works is every place sets up a stand, and it's eight bucks for whatever they're serving, and you don't have a choice.

32
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:39,524
Scott: So it's like, if you want what one guy is serving, you go up, you pay eight bucks, he gives it to you, right?

33
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,400
Scott: And pretty much everyone gives you, like, a thing with a side in it, right?

34
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:49,780
Rym: See, as much as I would have, you know, enjoyed things like that, Rymn's Law of the Diminishing Returns of Crowds comes into effect.

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,461
Scott: Right, so it was...

36
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:56,260
Rym: The bigger an event is, the less fun individual people attending that event will have, on average.

37
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,840
Scott: But anyway, so it was, you know, it wasn't as crowded as it looked in the pictures on the internet.

38
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:09,620
Scott: And actually, when I was there, I went there pretty early on Saturday, it actually wasn't all that crowded, and you could eat at almost any of the places without waiting.

39
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,920
Scott: So there was a place that had, like, a middling line, like a five-minute line, so I'm like, "Aha, the place with this line.

40
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,580
Scott: This place must be better," which is, of course, what everyone else was thinking.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,956
Scott: I was like, "Well, the line could just be longer because it had a momentum to it, and people think the same thing as me and got in the line because it had a

42
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:26,258
Scott: line.".

43
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,980
Rym: Could, but did they put that much thought into it?

44
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,145
Scott: Well, it doesn't matter, right?

45
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:32,880
Scott: So the place is called 17th Street Barbecue, right?

46
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,490
Scott: And they had baby vac ribs.

47
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:35,980
Scott: I think it was also because it had ribs.

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:45,140
Scott: A lot of the other places had things like pork shoulder or, you know, stuff like that, which would obviously be less popular than, I think, only one or two places had baby vac ribs, right?

49
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,420
Scott: So I got in that line, I waited five minutes, I paid eight bucks, I got some ribs and two scoops of beans, right?

50
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:53,008
Scott: So the ribs, they're pretty good.

51
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:58,779
Scott: It wasn't like, "Oh my God, the best ribs in the universe," like they were at, say, Soul Food Night, but they're pretty good.

52
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,620
Scott: But the beans, oh my God.

53
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,399
Scott: The best beans ever.

54
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:02,948
Scott: Those beans.

55
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,807
Rym: Notice how it's the same thing.

56
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:08,660
Rym: Like, we go to fancy steakhouses, and the steaks are always really good.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,739
Scott: The mashed potatoes.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:20,079
Rym: Yeah, it's rare for the steak to be, like, exceptional to a surprising degree, but somehow, the mashed potatoes at the Capitol Grill are way better than any mashed potatoes I have anywhere else.

59
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,345
Scott: Dude, I made a mashed potato.

60
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:22,511
Scott: I bought the heavy cream.

61
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:24,360
Scott: I added the, but it didn't matter.

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:24,912
Rym: I could not.

63
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,779
Rym: Heavy cream is good, but creme fraiche.

64
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,100
Scott: I didn't have a creme fraiche.

65
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,000
Rym: You should get some creme fraiche.

66
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,255
Scott: I'm gonna have to double it up next time.

67
00:03:32,361 --> 00:03:36,250
Scott: But anyway, I went to another place that was, you know, had St.

68
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,480
Scott: Louis ribs and this sort of salad blob as the side dish, right?

69
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,169
Scott: And the, actually, I think I like, you know, the St.

70
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:47,529
Scott: Louis ribs, I think, were the same quality level as the baby back ribs, like pretty, you know, pretty good.

71
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,040
Scott: Not the best ever, but pretty damn good.

72
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:51,251
Scott: But I think I personally prefer St.

73
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:52,880
Scott: Louis style in general.

74
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:55,720
Rym: Ah, I was about to say I prefer the opposite.

75
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:01,220
Scott: But then, and the salad mush looked very unappetizing, like it looked like a blob of coleslaw.

76
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,055
Scott: But actually, it was very good.

77
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:03,620
Scott: I was like, oh.

78
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,260
Rym: See, I think your condition, too many years ago into diners where they give you coleslaw that you don't want.

79
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,627
Scott: Yeah, this wasn't coleslaw, though.

80
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:11,640
Scott: This was actually a salad that happened to be in a blob.

81
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,500
Scott: That happened to be cabbage, but it wasn't, there was no mayonnaise in sight.

82
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,140
Rym: Wait, so it happened to be a blob of shredded cabbage?

83
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,860
Scott: Yeah, there was also onions and peppers and other things in there.

84
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,400
Scott: And it had a dressing that was, you just couldn't see because it was clear mostly.

85
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:26,040
Scott: But it wasn't vinegar based, at least not that I could tell.

86
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,550
Scott: And it was, there was no mayonnaise at all.

87
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:28,880
Scott: And it tasted really good.

88
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:29,295
Scott: Alright.

89
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,140
Scott: And then there was this place in the way back that had this gigantic line.

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,060
Scott: It was the only place with a monstrous line, like a line that went all the way down the block.

91
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:38,200
Scott: And I was like, oh my gosh.

92
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,800
Scott: No, the beer was actually in the middle of the park.

93
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:46,560
Scott: And there were guards at every entrance to the circle in the park, so you couldn't leave that circle with beer.

94
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,100
Scott: You had to stay in there if you were drinking.

95
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,657
Scott: Because, you know, no drinking in the park.

96
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:57,280
Scott: But the place with the crazy long line, I was like, whoa, what the fuck is going on with this crazy long line?

97
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,978
Scott: I just ignored it.

98
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,740
Scott: I went to get a fried pie.

99
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,420
Scott: And there was a big line for the fried pie, but I get pretty close to the front.

100
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:09,879
Scott: And basically it seems like they can't make the fried pies as fast as people buy them.

101
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,919
Rym: So did they already have pie made and they were simply frying it?

102
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,119
Rym: Or were they making pies and then frying them?

103
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,520
Scott: No, it was, fried pie is this particular thing.

104
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:20,669
Scott: It's sort of like...

105
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:23,239
Rym: Plus a deep fryer.

106
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:31,380
Scott: No, it's sort of like, imagine if you had some sort of friedness that was halfway between funnel cake and pie crust.

107
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:36,140
Scott: And it was sort of in the shape of like, you know, a calzone, but flat, right?

108
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,160
Scott: So it was like a half circle, flat, fried stuff filled with fruit, right?

109
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,160
Scott: So it was sort of like a justice fruit pie, only hot and fried.

110
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:47,340
Scott: So they had all these different flavors.

111
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:51,200
Scott: And I noticed that, you know, people were basically waiting for pies to come out.

112
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:54,520
Scott: And people were ordering like apple and blackberry and whatever, right?

113
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:57,940
Scott: And I see some pies just sitting there and they're not being taken.

114
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:00,240
Scott: And I go up and I'm like, uh, apricot.

115
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,168
Scott: The guy just gives me one.

116
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:02,139
Scott: I'm like, hell, that's right.

117
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,159
Rym: What if people not know what apricot is?

118
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,194
Scott: People just didn't want...

119
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:06,080
Rym: Or apricot.

120
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,967
Scott: People were stupid.

121
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:08,120
Scott: They didn't order the apricot.

122
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,860
Rym: I think a lot of people don't know that they like apricot.

123
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,580
Scott: So I got the apricot and it was pretty good fried pie.

124
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,034
Scott: It was only four dollars.

125
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:26,100
Scott: So actually, I think the strategy for the barbecue thing is you... They have this fast pass thing, which is like, if you pay a zillion dollars and you order... They sell out of them really quickly.

126
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:27,520
Scott: So you need to get it in advance.

127
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,640
Scott: They actually... Every booth has registers on both sides.

128
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,200
Scott: So you can go to the registers on the back side if you have the fast pass.

129
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,258
Scott: You don't have to wait in any lines.

130
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,079
Scott: But I think you still have to pay.

131
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,678
Scott: Which is like, what?

132
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:39,300
Rym: Of course.

133
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,779
Scott: And who could eat that much barbecue?

134
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,959
Rym: Have you seen people?

135
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,420
Scott: Actually, the people with the fast passes.

136
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,780
Scott: I didn't see that many fat people.

137
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,155
Rym: It was early.

138
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,140
Scott: I think the strategy is you could do lunch dinner Saturday, lunch dinner Sunday.

139
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:55,020
Scott: And you can eat two meals at each one for sixteen bucks each.

140
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,300
Scott: And that can give you a maximum of eight barbecues with a reasonable stomach size.

141
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,739
Scott: I only ate the two and then I left.

142
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:04,620
Rym: So non-food related.

143
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:05,940
Rym: You know, Wildwood on the shore.

144
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,460
Rym: Our biggest thing at the shore, other than the beach, is always the arcades on the boardwalk.

145
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:12,900
Scott: Which decrease in quality drastically every single year.

146
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,020
Rym: For the last decade, every year, I've gone to Wildwood.

147
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,960
Rym: And Wildwood always had better arcades than any arcade I see anywhere else.

148
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:24,180
Rym: Sadly, it still has better arcades than I see in most places.

149
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,008
Scott: But there's still shit.

150
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:25,210
Scott: 99% cranes.

151
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:28,800
Rym: No, well, some arcades came and went.

152
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:30,520
Scott: Not as good as Fun Spot.

153
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:32,119
Rym: Fun Spot kind of sucked.

154
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:33,980
Scott: Compared to Wildwood?

155
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:37,120
Rym: Most of the games didn't work and I had a lot of trouble at Fun Spot.

156
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,900
Rym: I was not impressed.

157
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:40,940
Rym: I was much more impressed with other places I've been than Fun Spot.

158
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,800
Scott: And what place at Wildwood is even close?

159
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,740
Rym: Well, it just so happens that this year, you know, we were checking out all the arcades.

160
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,640
Rym: The one great arcade that used to have all those DDR machines in a row.

161
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:54,899
Rym: It's still that closed, busted ass haunted house now.

162
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:56,199
Rym: It's so sad.

163
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:59,136
Scott: What about my favorite underground, Ruhokuten?

164
00:07:59,156 --> 00:07:59,740
Scott: no Ken used to be?

165
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,373
Rym: So, so, so.

166
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,080
Rym: Before I get to that, we go to where the one... Where's the good game last year?

167
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:08,100
Rym: What was the big game, the best game on the boardwalk?

168
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,619
Rym: Nothing.

169
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,579
Rym: Tanks, tanks, tanks?

170
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:11,919
Scott: I didn't play that that much.

171
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,027
Rym: You didn't play tanks?

172
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:13,956
Rym: That was like the best game.

173
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:14,320
Rym: Anyway.

174
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,708
Rym: So, tanks, tanks, tanks.

175
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,100
Rym: The only good new game was gone.

176
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,640
Rym: I don't know if it broke or what, but pretty much cranes everywhere.

177
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,333
Rym: Every arcade is just a disaster.

178
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:23,180
Rym: There's nothing left.

179
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,480
Scott: At least Fun Spot does have real games.

180
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:33,780
Rym: We're walking down into that underground mall and Scojo and I stop at the threshold because we see everything's missing.

181
00:08:33,922 --> 00:08:35,278
Rym: It looks like it's just empty down there.

182
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,182
Scott: Really?

183
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:38,400
Scott: My favorite underground mall was ruined?

184
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,820
Rym: Well, it was ruined years ago when the Hokutona Ken machine stopped working.

185
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:42,600
Scott: I'm just saying.

186
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,916
Rym: So we see it's empty and we hear carnival music.

187
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:52,359
Rym: and I see like in the far corner, it looks like they've set up like carny games with carnies like along the wall.

188
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:54,267
Rym: And there's carnival music.

189
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:54,951
Rym: We're like, "What?

190
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:55,414
Rym: What?

191
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:56,058
Rym: No, no,

192
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:56,158
Rym: no.".

193
00:08:56,662 --> 00:09:00,980
Rym: And then I walk the rest of the way down and I see classic pinball.

194
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,658
Rym: And I see electro-mechanical games from the 40s and 50s.

195
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:05,913
Scott: Oh, shit.

196
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,200
Rym: Lined up all the fuck over the place.

197
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,894
Rym: And there's this dude standing.

198
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:11,400
Rym: There's a fence.

199
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,680
Rym: Like, I can't get to the games, but I can see them and they are glorious.

200
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,863
Scott: Uh-huh.

201
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:17,996
Scott: Somebody put it in the exact right spot.

202
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:18,680
Scott: My favorite spot.

203
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,680
Rym: So it's almost all classic pinball.

204
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,149
Rym: 40s, 50s, 60s.

205
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,660
Rym: Some of them are made out of all wood.

206
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:26,780
Rym: Some of them are almost entirely mechanical.

207
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:27,419
Rym: Of course.

208
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,940
Rym: It was pretty goddamn awesome.

209
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,838
Scott: So where did they come from?

210
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:30,899
Rym: So there's this guy.

211
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,080
Rym: It's this "remember when" entertainment or something.

212
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,819
Scott: Did you talk to him?

213
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:35,139
Rym: Uh, yeah, I talked to him.

214
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:37,116
Rym: And we'll probably have him on the show soon.

215
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:47,500
Rym: I don't know how much I can really reveal, but remember in Wildwood, whenever we'd go to eat at that Mexican place or go to the bookstore, there was that old Woolworths building.

216
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:53,760
Rym: And it was full of like just weird old 50s boardwalk stuff and buster.

217
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:55,899
Rym: The same guy owns that.

218
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,222
Scott: Oh.

219
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,220
Rym: And that was pegged to be a classic arcade museum.

220
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,853
Rym: And the permits are done.

221
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:05,519
Rym: Everything's all set.

222
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,040
Rym: The city council in fucking Wildwood doesn't want it to open.

223
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:09,899
Scott: Why not?

224
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:18,360
Rym: Because they believe that having an arcade of any kind on that street will draw an undesirable element.

225
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,663
Scott: Uh-huh.

226
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:23,080
Scott: An undesirable element to play old-timey pinball?

227
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,938
Scott: What, 40 and 50-year-old guys?

228
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:32,358
Rym: Now, somehow, the museum for classic games will draw an unhealthy, you know, quote, "undesirable audience,".

229
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:35,173
Rym: yet the bar next door that has $1.50 shots is fine?

230
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,200
Scott: Maybe, maybe that's the thing, right?

231
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,340
Scott: Maybe, you know, they say "undesirable element," right?

232
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,050
Rym: And we think that they mean, you know, being young kids-- No, they mean smart, rich people who won't go to crappy bars and buy $1.50 shots.

233
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,040
Scott: Exactly, right?

234
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,040
Scott: We think when old people say "undesirable element," that they mean punk kids who are going to cause trouble.

235
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,180
Scott: But the reality is, no, they want drunken college kids.

236
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:58,019
Scott: That's who they're looking for.

237
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,940
Scott: "Undesirable element" is reasonable, quiet people who are only going to spend a little bit of money putting quarters in the pinball machines.

238
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:13,720
Rym: Talking to the guy, though, it sounded like the people who are opposing it are just old and dumb enough to where they just equate arcades and pinball and all these things with the fights.

239
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,899
Scott: But not really lewd t-shirts and also with all the other nasty shit in the bottom.

240
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:19,578
Rym: I don't know.

241
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:20,639
Scott: What are they thinking?

242
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,900
Rym: So there's this whole drama thing, but the dude, too, he was really cool.

243
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,500
Rym: We were talking to him, and the way he runs it is you pay five bucks a half hour and just all you can play.

244
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,420
Scott: Oh, my God, I give him $30.

245
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,799
Rym: We were there a while, all of us.

246
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:33,418
Rym: We just got in a line.

247
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,039
Rym: Me and Emily, we'd both play a game.

248
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:36,619
Scott: How does he time you?

249
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:38,420
Rym: He just does the honors system.

250
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:39,159
Scott: Oh, man.

251
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:40,900
Rym: I'm sure he might kick you out.

252
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,040
Rym: He gave us a bunch of extra time because he was cool and we were cool.

253
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,340
Scott: I just give him 20 bucks and play until I didn't feel like playing anymore and then give him 20 bucks every time.

254
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:52,379
Rym: The cool thing is a lot of these games are old enough to where they had multiplayer built in.

255
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:53,420
Scott: You take turns ball for ball.

256
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:58,380
Scott: Almost every pinball machine I've ever seen, almost all of them have built in multiplayer.

257
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,880
Rym: Most of the ones I've seen that had it would always be one guy plays, then the other guy plays.

258
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,079
Rym: This was alternating ball.

259
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:06,779
Scott: Yeah, alternating ball, yeah.

260
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,440
Rym: I haven't seen that on most modern pinball games I've played.

261
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,097
Scott: I don't know.

262
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:17,020
Scott: The thing is, the problem is the modern ones do have it, but you can't really, because the old ones, for example, would have four different score spinners.

263
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,460
Rym: Exactly.

264
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:17,940
Scott: Right?

265
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,880
Scott: And then it would light up whose turn it was.

266
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:23,780
Scott: The modern ones are digital, so it's not as obvious.

267
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:26,198
Scott: The user interface doesn't let you really-- Yeah, you know what?

268
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,739
Rym: Having played a whole bunch of old-school pinball recently so it's fresh in my mind, fuck most modern pinball machines.

269
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:32,758
Rym: They kind of suck.

270
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:36,640
Scott: Well, you know, it's-- I played some great goddamn pinball.

271
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,440
Scott: I'm a fan-- The thing is the earliest of early pinballs, right?

272
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,120
Scott: A lot of them are too simplistic to actually be kind of interesting.

273
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:50,777
Scott: I like the ones that are sort of from the later mechanical era and then, of course, the early digital era, right?

274
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:54,360
Rym: Well, a lot of these had something-- you could see the different eras of pinball.

275
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:58,119
Rym: For a while, it was all the Gottfried whatever, the little flippers.

276
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:03,439
Rym: And then a lot of them had gimmicks, like the flippers will move on you, like they'll slide in or pull out.

277
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:08,218
Rym: And then you suddenly see a point where everybody has the big flippers instead of the little ones.

278
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:12,639
Rym: And then suddenly, oh, now all the pinball machines have the upper and the lower flippers.

279
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:17,879
Rym: And some of them, there were weird gimmicks that I'd never seen before.

280
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:22,000
Rym: The one, there were like spinners all over.

281
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:22,860
Scott: The cyclone?

282
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,240
Rym: It wasn't the cyclone.

283
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,178
Rym: It was way older than that.

284
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,469
Rym: Right.

285
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,180
Rym: But it had all these flat spinners that would like catch the ball and kind of like-- it would move it around.

286
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,220
Scott: Sometimes the ball would get stuck.

287
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,680
Rym: Like spin it around in the middle.

288
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,560
Rym: But in the middle of all that, there was this thing of balls.

289
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:40,860
Rym: And it would always tell you, like, knock all the balls into the left, knock all the balls into the right.

290
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,340
Rym: And you had to physically knock them.

291
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,780
Rym: And it was a really kind of neat mechanism as to how it worked.

292
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,760
Rym: So we'd play a lot of multiplayer.

293
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,720
Rym: And the one, like, big one, I did really well at this one pinball machine.

294
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,580
Scott: Actually, what you want to do is if you have two people, you play two machines multiplayer at the same time.

295
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,679
Rym: That's what we were trying to do.

296
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,358
Scott: You trade off.

297
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:00,779
Scott: The thing is, if one person dies right away, now what do they do?

298
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,160
Rym: I did really well.

299
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,259
Rym: Like, I wrecked it.

300
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,599
Rym: I thought I was doing awesome.

301
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,074
Rym: So I'm like, "Skull Joe, beat that fucking

302
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:06,317
Rym: score.".

303
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,639
Rym: He sits there and proceeds to roll the machine over.

304
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:12,080
Rym: I'm not super great at pinball.

305
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,059
Rym: So the dude, right?

306
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,219
Scott: It's hard to tell, right, when it comes to something, right?

307
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:20,839
Scott: It's like, if you're playing something like Counter-Strike, you know if you're doing well because you're at the top of this chart.

308
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:22,240
Scott: that's being made right then and there.

309
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:28,579
Scott: But if you're playing something like pinball, and the machine might have a built-in high score, but you don't know where that high score is from.

310
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:31,540
Scott: You don't really know what is a good score.

311
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,740
Rym: That's why single-player pinball, you really just have to keep playing the same machine and try to beat your previous score.

312
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,900
Scott: There's no way to gauge what is a good score.

313
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,339
Scott: Which is boring to me.

314
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,640
Rym: That's why I really like just how well integrated the multiplayer was in these old games.

315
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,138
Rym: Because they were literally like, "All right, direct competition for friends, go for

316
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:48,279
Rym: it."

317
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,309
Rym: And finally they all had notices on them that were like, "This is a game of

318
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,258
Rym: skill.".

319
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,340
Rym: Because remember all the old laws trying to outlaw pinball, saying it was the game of chance, no wagering.

320
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:02,940
Rym: So we talked to the guy and he's super cool.

321
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:06,976
Rym: And you didn't say I couldn't say this, so I'm just going to say it.

322
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:11,060
Rym: He had a whole bunch of video equipment all set up all over the place.

323
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,110
Rym: And we're like, "Hey, what's going on with

324
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:12,332
Rym: that?".

325
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:15,979
Rym: So he's going to be featured on that A&E show, Hoarders.

326
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:23,440
Rym: Which didn't really make sense to me because he, one, was articulate and cool, wasn't crazy.

327
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:26,700
Rym: Two, his machines are actually valuable.

328
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,698
Rym: He's not like an old lady keeping, I don't know, jars of poop.

329
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,820
Scott: Yeah, but who knows what other things he hoards, right?

330
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,145
Scott: No, just this.

331
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,340
Rym: Just old boardwalk stuff and pinball machines.

332
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:43,280
Rym: And he keeps all the machines in excellent condition and that collection is probably worth a fortune.

333
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,320
Scott: Yeah, the thing is, you think it's worth a fortune, but actually, you know, it's not that it's cheap, right?

334
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,480
Rym: Well, worth a fortune relative to the things that people tend to hoard.

335
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,300
Scott: Yeah, that's for sure.

336
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,720
Rym: I mean, a lady who's hoarding like Kewpie dolls, those are not worth so much.

337
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,579
Scott: No shit, really.

338
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,360
Rym: So the guy is totally cool and chill and I'm actually kind of curious to see how they portray him on Hoarders.

339
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,419
Rym: Because you know how TV shows are like that, where I really want to see...

340
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,317
Scott: Actually, I don't know what show this is, but I get everything I'm thinking about.

341
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:11,720
Scott: the show is based solely on the name.

342
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,960
Rym: You know, as much as I'm disconnected from pop culture, you never cease to amaze me sometimes.

343
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:17,500
Rym: Okay.

344
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:20,879
Rym: So this place was pretty goddamn badass and that was my weekend.

345
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,419
Scott: Well, you had to go check that out.

346
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,740
Rym: The boardwalk was so disappointing, every other aspect other than, you know, food was the same.

347
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,640
Scott: But that one thing is enough to revive the whole thing.

348
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,080
Rym: Yeah, but it was such a rollercoaster of emotion as I'm walking down the boardwalk and everything sucked, everything sucked, everything sucked.

349
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,400
Scott: I'm telling you, there's something about that underground mall, it's like a magical secret mall.

350
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,720
Rym: And that's why the final moment I get down there and for a second, I thought it was gone.

351
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,820
Scott: I swear to God, you know what's in the back room is the wizard machine from Big.

352
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:46,596
Scott: I swear to God.

353
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:51,800
Rym: So, it's Tuesday.

354
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,579
Rym: Talk about some news.

355
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:53,460
Rym: I mean, E3 happened.

356
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,454
Scott: There's a billion gaming newses that we don't have time to talk about.

357
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:56,799
Scott: all of them.

358
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,169
Rym: Yup.

359
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,524
Rym: So, do you have any non-E3 news before?

360
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:03,159
Rym: I talk about the only E3 news that I want to talk about right now?

361
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,759
Scott: Yeah, 'cause you know what?

362
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,536
Scott: 'Cause it's actually been a while since E3.

363
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,479
Scott: I sort of forget most of the newses except, you know, the gigantic ones.

364
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,397
Scott: There's just so many game announcements and it's like, well, you know, we'll talk about those games when they come out, I guess, if we care about them.

365
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,559
Scott: But there was a big news that has nothing to do with video games.

366
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,679
Scott: It has to do everything with role-playing games.

367
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,560
Scott: Announced as of, I guess, today?

368
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:25,020
Rym: Oh, right.

369
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,099
Rym: I guess that was actually officially announced.

370
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,473
Scott: Yeah, yesterday-ish, right?

371
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,820
Scott: Burning Wheel Gold.

372
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:34,220
Scott: It will be out sometime, I guess, July-ish?

373
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,340
Rym: Time to burn all my revised books.

374
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,020
Scott: Right, so basically, what is Burning Wheel Gold?

375
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:46,939
Scott: Well, whether you know or you don't know, there was Burning Wheel Classic, then Burning Wheel Revised, which is what we've been playing, and now there's Burning Wheel Gold.

376
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,079
Scott: It basically is a new version of Burning Wheel.

377
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:55,259
Rym: From the way it was described to me, it primarily tightens up and adds consistency to the rules.

378
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,859
Scott: Everything that I've read about what the improvements are, it is better.

379
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:01,839
Scott: At least, you know, in my opinion.

380
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:13,600
Rym: I think Luke said something like it was removing a lot of the sort of weird or specific exceptions that, while they might have been cool mechanically, really just added confusion and didn't actually help the game out that much.

381
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,096
Scott: Well, for example, right now, with Fight, right?

382
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,300
Scott: So Fight has been streamlined a great deal.

383
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,340
Scott: So one thing in Fight that was always sort of tricky was the positioning, right?

384
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,879
Scott: Do you close, do you steal, you know, retreat, or whatever?

385
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,920
Rym: Steal, retreat, and all that is range and cover.

386
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:31,160
Scott: Right, that's right.

387
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:35,560
Rym: You haven't really played much Fight, have you?

388
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,560
Scott: No, because I was a void Fight because it was complicated.

389
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,440
Scott: It's not that complicated!

390
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,299
Scott: But you know what, now Fight's even easier.

391
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:44,180
Scott: First of all, range and cover was changed, but Fight is also changed, right?

392
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,080
Scott: And you know what they did in Fight?

393
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:48,040
Scott: The positioning is just, you position.

394
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Scott: And if, you know, let's say I've got long range and you've got a dagger, right?

395
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:55,520
Scott: And I've got a spear, and we position.

396
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:59,900
Scott: If I win, you're far away from me, and if you win, you're really close.

397
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:01,459
Scott: And that's pretty much all it comes down to.

398
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,558
Scott: It's just, whoever, if you win the positioning, you're at your best advantage and your opponent's at the worst advantage, and vice versa.

399
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:08,056
Rym: Uh-huh.

400
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:10,880
Rym: What if you want to be at a disadvantage or something?

401
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:13,519
Scott: I'm sure you can do that if you want to.

402
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,540
Scott: I'm just curious, because it's one thing where-- What do you do if you want to fail a roll in Burning Wheel?

403
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,740
Rym: I'll just say that I honestly don't feel like the positioning was the complicated part of Fight.

404
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:24,999
Scott: No, it wasn't that it was complicated, right?

405
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,280
Scott: It's that you want to get to the good stuff and make it faster, right?

406
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,999
Scott: So it's like, you spend all this time positioning, and then roll the roll that really matters, the strike.

407
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:37,739
Scott: So this way, it's like you just get to the rolls that matter more quickly.

408
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,439
Scott: Actually, I never bothered with Strike.

409
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,120
Rym: I'd always be like Counter-Strike, Faint, or something.

410
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,065
Scott: And the other thing is, for Fight, you know how?

411
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:48,899
Scott: for Duel of Wits, there's the chart that says, "This does this when meeting up with this"?

412
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,044
Scott: Yup.

413
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:50,740
Scott: Now there's that chart for Fight.

414
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,700
Scott: It's actually two pages.

415
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:53,420
Rym: I had a chart like that for Fight already.

416
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,060
Scott: Yeah, but now there's-- It's probably better.

417
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,460
Scott: It even has the weird things, like, "What if I Strike and he Sorceries?

418
00:19:59,561 --> 00:19:59,827
Scott: What do you

419
00:19:59,848 --> 00:19:59,970
Scott: do?".

420
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:01,839
Scott: You know, it has all that.

421
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:08,520
Scott: But anyway, yeah, Burning Wheel Gold, it combines the Burning Wheel and the Character Burner in one handy book.

422
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:13,400
Scott: The book has been much more streamlined, and the book itself is more useful.

423
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,440
Scott: The rules have been updated.

424
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:15,831
Scott: It's gonna be $25, I think.

425
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:24,839
Scott: The pre-orders are gonna go up, and I think he's got a plan to do, like, 50 pre-orders a day for five days or something along those lines.

426
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,379
Scott: You can get it even if you fail to pre-order, right?

427
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,020
Scott: You just won't get it immediately.

428
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,318
Rym: So, do you guys want us to get Luke on the show to talk about it?

429
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:35,037
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

430
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,640
Rym: 'Cause I feel like we could do a whole--.

431
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,420
Rym: We could put it up as an extra episode outside of the stream of GeekNights so we don't interrupt.

432
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:47,250
Scott: The other important thing, right, is that, you know, in Burning Wheel, the most important pages in the whole book are the first 75 pages.

433
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:50,680
Scott: That's really the hub and the spokes, 'cause that's all you really need to play.

434
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,020
Scott: You can play with that, right?

435
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,200
Scott: The rest is all the advanced rules, and also making characters, which is a lot.

436
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,360
Scott: It's gonna be hundreds and hundreds of pages, probably like 500 pages you're missing.

437
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:01,279
Scott: If you only get the--.

438
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,531
Scott: But that first part, the part that you can play with, is free PDF.

439
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:06,359
Scott: You can get it right now.

440
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,309
Scott: Finally, Luke.

441
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:08,100
Scott: Finally.

442
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:19,460
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you should sell the whole book as PDF, but, I mean, first part of the book, enough to play the sword with the sword characters included for, you know, free, that's pretty damn good.

443
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,940
Rym: I'd go one step further if I were him.

444
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,240
Rym: I would take the old Burning Wheel, the revised one, and sell, like, a $1 PDF of the whole thing.

445
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:29,080
Scott: Well, I think he just-- He wants to make it go away completely.

446
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:30,359
Rym: Ah, he can't make it go away.

447
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,959
Scott: I don't understand why he always wants to, like, you know, hide these old things.

448
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,055
Scott: I'll never get it.

449
00:21:35,722 --> 00:21:38,660
Scott: But I've given up trying to convince him because he'll never change his mind.

450
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,460
Rym: Does a cat not try to bury its poop?

451
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,460
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, you know, Michael Jackson doesn't stop selling Thriller.

452
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,540
Rym: Does a pyro not try to bury his poop?

453
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:53,549
Rym: The point is, right-- That was a joke from a long time ago.

454
00:21:53,991 --> 00:21:59,170
Scott: You know, if you make a whole bunch of music, it's not like you don't sell the oldest album.

455
00:21:59,250 --> 00:21:59,637
Rym: Well, you know what?

456
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:00,249
Rym: I'll put it this way.

457
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:05,950
Rym: You guys can go onto our website and listen to GeekNights from October of 2005.

458
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,254
Rym: You know what?

459
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:07,410
Rym: It kind of sucks.

460
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,010
Scott: It's awful.

461
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:08,977
Rym: And you know what?

462
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:09,930
Rym: It's online.

463
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,110
Scott: It's gonna be there forever.

464
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:12,949
Scott: As long as I can keep it there.

465
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,354
Scott: Right?

466
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:21,605
Scott: So, you know, if I was him, you know, I would just make everything 100% free PDF and sell the books anyway.

467
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:23,990
Rym: That's all I would-- No, I'd sell the PDF for a few bucks.

468
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,770
Scott: I would sell the PDF also, but I would also make the PDF free.

469
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,590
Rym: Wait, so I'd sell the PDF and have the PDF for free?

470
00:22:29,712 --> 00:22:30,060
Scott: Yes.

471
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,469
Scott: No.

472
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,138
Scott: Why not?

473
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:31,670
Rym: Why bother?

474
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,666
Rym: The people who want it for free are gonna pirate it anyway, so I might as well just say, "Hey, five

475
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:35,989
Rym: bucks.".

476
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:46,150
Scott: No, because there are some people who will, you know, who will pay, even though-- Yeah, but I think you'd-- It's basically the equivalent of a donation box.

477
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,870
Rym: Yeah, but I think you'd make more money.

478
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,406
Rym: It's effectively a donation box if you sell it for five bucks, 'cause it's just a PDF.

479
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:52,788
Scott: No, I don't think so.

480
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:53,517
Rym: Why not?

481
00:22:53,557 --> 00:22:54,187
Rym: It's the exact--.

482
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,410
Rym: There's the exact same mechanism design.

483
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:58,530
Rym: The only difference is the moral incentive.

484
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,790
Scott: You don't put the free PDF and the paid PDF in the same location.

485
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:02,488
Scott: That's the trick.

486
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,450
Scott: You don't put 'em right next to each other.

487
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,350
Rym: That's the Nessus strategy, and I think that's kind of a BS strategy.

488
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:08,888
Scott: But it works.

489
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:14,090
Rym: I think you should just sell a PDF of all the old Burning Wheel shit for, like, a dollar.

490
00:23:14,874 --> 00:23:15,405
Scott: I'd do that too.

491
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:15,650
Scott: Why not?

492
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:15,999
Rym: Yep.

493
00:23:17,052 --> 00:23:17,609
Rym: So, we'll see.

494
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:21,310
Rym: It's funny how we just started a Burning Wheel campaign.

495
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:22,318
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

496
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:24,763
Scott: when we started it, I was like, "Let's ignore the new book.

497
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:25,429
Scott: Let's just play with these old

498
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:25,530
Scott: ones.".

499
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:34,150
Rym: I kinda still wanna ignore the new book, just because I wanna play a campaign with a small number of characters, for real, with the old system.

500
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:36,190
Scott: Yeah, we have our whole lives to do that.

501
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,410
Scott: It's not like he's setting our old books on fire.

502
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,850
Rym: I'll bet he would if he could.

503
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:41,566
Scott: He would if he could, but he can't.

504
00:23:42,572 --> 00:23:45,710
Rym: He realized we're gonna wake up and he's gonna be in our apartment with, like, a lighter.

505
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:50,049
Scott: I think he's sort of resigned himself to that, but he's definitely not making more of the old ones.

506
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:51,470
Scott: Anyway.

507
00:23:51,810 --> 00:24:02,670
Rym: So, remember a day a long time ago when, you know, flush off the success of the GameCube and, you know, Nintendo was still very high up on the Rym-and-scot scale of things that are awesome.

508
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:08,670
Rym: Nintendo was up there doing cool stuff 'cause they hadn't quite really given up on us kinda gamers yet.

509
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:14,309
Rym: And as far as we could see, the GameCube and the GBA link and all that was like, "Alright, they tried this.

510
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:16,789
Rym: It didn't go that well, but clearly there's potential here.

511
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,825
Rym: The Wii will make every dream come

512
00:24:18,886 --> 00:24:19,108
Rym: true.".

513
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,990
Rym: Remember when the Wii was called the Revolution 'cause it was gonna revolutionize gaming and whatever?

514
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,209
Scott: Yeah, I believed in it at that time.

515
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,590
Rym: Remember when they had the press release?

516
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,105
Rym: They're like, "Yeah, it's called the

517
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:28,287
Rym: Wii.".

518
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,290
Rym: And everyone made fun of it for, like, a week, and then now it's just the Wii.

519
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:32,927
Scott: I waited in line to buy it.

520
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:33,769
Scott: Yeah, you did.

521
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,348
Scott: The first day.

522
00:24:35,212 --> 00:24:46,310
Rym: And I remember sitting at home playing that WarioWare game, trying to like it, really wanting to like it, and then looking online 'cause I couldn't find the multiplayer only to discover that there was no multiplayer.

523
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:49,270
Scott: Though there was really awful non-multiplayer.

524
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,070
Rym: There effectively wasn't multiplayer.

525
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,669
Scott: There wasn't any simultaneous multiplayer.

526
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,449
Rym: Which was the only reason to ever play WarioWare.

527
00:24:56,671 --> 00:25:02,470
Rym: So, we're older now, wiser, more mature, more experienced under our belts.

528
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,929
Rym: Carousel's coming up in like seven months for us.

529
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:06,390
Scott: Yep.

530
00:25:07,192 --> 00:25:09,849
Rym: And Nintendo has announced the Wii U.

531
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:13,970
Scott: Wii U. Wii U. Alright, there's enough Wii U jokes.

532
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:14,670
Scott: We're not gonna...

533
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:15,769
Rym: I can't even make fun of it.

534
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,127
Rym: It's, the funny thing is, what did we always complain about with the Wii?

535
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:25,810
Rym: That they didn't use the cool concepts they had of the shared spaces and the private spaces.

536
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,810
Rym: The GBA connected to the GameCube.

537
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:30,010
Rym: They didn't do that with the DS and the Wii.

538
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,490
Rym: They didn't use the primary potential of that console.

539
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:35,489
Rym: And we were fucked and we gave up on them.

540
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,809
Rym: Now suddenly, they're doing basically just that.

541
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:41,608
Scott: Well, you know what?

542
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:43,609
Scott: The thing is, they're actually not.

543
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:45,910
Rym: Well, I've learned a lot of things about this.

544
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:49,190
Rym: One, the new controller supposedly is not multitasking.

545
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,489
Rym: It's single touch.

546
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,610
Scott: I can't even imagine why.

547
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,410
Scott: It's the same as a DS screen.

548
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,569
Scott: So basically... Because Nintendo loves styluses.

549
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:56,690
Rym: That's why.

550
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:07,450
Rym: So basically, rather than using the Wii to its full potential and just having another five years of the Wii and having my DS or my DSi or my 3DS just connect to the Wii, which would be fine.

551
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,489
Rym: You could do everything that Nintendo had not done yet.

552
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:11,950
Rym: Fulfill all the potential.

553
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,410
Rym: Nintendo has never realized with that.

554
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:26,490
Rym: Instead, they're gonna sell me a console and then they're gonna sell me basically a crappy DS that only has one screen and really only works as a controller for my Wii U.

555
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,969
Scott: You wanna hear the worst thing ever?

556
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:28,480
Scott: Huh?

557
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:30,870
Scott: If you have a Wii U, right?

558
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,830
Scott: You can only have one of those controllers at a time.

559
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:33,103
Scott: What?

560
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:34,228
Rym: I didn't even know that.

561
00:26:34,632 --> 00:26:34,722
Scott: Yeah.

562
00:26:36,616 --> 00:26:37,067
Rym: So, Nintendo...

563
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,910
Scott: It's like, oh, so it's worthless.

564
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,367
Rym: So Nintendo...

565
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:51,163
Scott: The only good thing I have to say about it, right, is that you look at some of the other things that... Nintendo keeps adding new features and new elements with every console they release, right, whether it's handheld or for TV.

566
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,170
Rym: Well, simultaneously removing things.

567
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,830
Scott: Well, no, but the thing is, some of those things they add are used extensively.

568
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:04,450
Scott: This is why the DS was such a great success because every DS game used both screens.

569
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,030
Scott: Every DS game used stylus and touch in some way, right?

570
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:14,910
Scott: Those are the things they added to the DS and pretty much every DS game used them and almost every DS game used the wireless in some way.

571
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:22,163
Rym: Ah, but to make a counterpoint, the majority of games, especially early on, technically used the microphone and the stylus, but really...

572
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,450
Scott: Well, microphone was a fail.

573
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,430
Rym: It was hacked on bullshit.

574
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:26,410
Rym: Even the early Castlevania games.

575
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:30,130
Rym: Oh, the stylus was just added on bullshit that didn't even matter to the game.

576
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,829
Rym: Like, oh, touch the blue blocks to make it disappear.

577
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,386
Scott: But at least two screens was used in almost every single game.

578
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:38,529
Rym: Even though a lot of games just put a status screen up there and left it at that.

579
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:40,669
Scott: Right, but how about Phoenix Wright DS stylus?

580
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:41,050
Scott: Yeah.

581
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:42,270
Scott: Totally, totally good.

582
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,524
Scott: But anyway, those things actually got used.

583
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:46,410
Scott: is the point, right?

584
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,590
Scott: But on Wii, the motion stuff only really got used in Wii Sports and Wii Sports Plus.

585
00:27:51,992 --> 00:27:53,490
Scott: No, it was used... Or Wii Sports Resort.

586
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:57,370
Rym: If you look at the average DS game, you know, take out the outliers.

587
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,749
Rym: So take out the absolute shovelware, like the bottom, and take out the great first party games.

588
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:11,724
Rym: The average middle of the road game, most of them, I would argue, use the stylus or the touch screen in a minimal gimmicky bullshit way and that was the end of it.

589
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:15,050
Scott: They definitely used the two screens though.

590
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,369
Rym: The Wii was the same way.

591
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:24,450
Rym: The waggle was used really well by a small number of games and was just an extra button that was kind of awkward to use for most games.

592
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:38,109
Scott: Right, but the point about the Wii U, right, is that the extra screen, the feature of screen in the controller, regardless of any other features they've got, that feature can be used very easily with pretty much every single game.

593
00:28:38,411 --> 00:28:43,550
Scott: The same way that the two screens of the DS can be used in every single game.

594
00:28:44,536 --> 00:29:00,090
Scott: So that's their problem, is they add these features that have potential, but developers or someone doesn't know how to use it or isn't created enough or it's too much effort, but that screen in the controller will be used with every single game in some sort of minimally effective way.

595
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,970
Scott: At very least, it'll be like an inventory screen or something.

596
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,010
Rym: So I have two things to say to that.

597
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,750
Rym: One, I realize now why that never happened.

598
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:17,209
Rym: Everyone who had actual cool ideas for how to use the weird things Nintendo added to their consoles were indie developers that Nintendo basically won't even talk to.

599
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:17,789
Scott: That's right.

600
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,870
Rym: And locks out as much as they can.

601
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,370
Scott: That's right.

602
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,789
Rym: And two, talking about the screen.

603
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:24,210
Rym: We don't need it.

604
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:31,050
Rym: The fact that the screen can only be on one of the controllers makes it less, it's not even a thing.

605
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:31,689
Scott: I know.

606
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:32,310
Scott: It's nothing.

607
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:32,910
Scott: It's nothing.

608
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:36,045
Scott: Why don't they just let everyone use 3DSs?

609
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:44,570
Scott: because supposedly the Wii has the capability to connect 8DS lights simultaneously.

610
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,699
Scott: That's what I've heard.

611
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,530
Scott: But not once has anyone made a game that actually uses that feature.

612
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:59,069
Scott: The only time I've ever seen the DS connect to the Wii is if you get the Nintendo channel on the Wii, you can download demos to your DS over the Wi-Fi.

613
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:04,506
Scott: I've never seen anyone else use the DS Wii connection any other way than that.

614
00:30:05,113 --> 00:30:05,867
Scott: Imagine the potential.

615
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,250
Scott: Even though it's theoretically possible.

616
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:07,910
Scott: Eight swords.

617
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:09,630
Rym: Just make fucking eight swords.

618
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,728
Scott: I don't know why they just don't do these obvious things like eight swords.

619
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,169
Scott: Even four swords two is enough for me.

620
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,390
Rym: Crystal Chronicles that's actually like the original and not those crappy remakes.

621
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,949
Scott: So on DSiWare, they put out for free the four swords.

622
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,309
Scott: But it's GBA four swords.

623
00:30:27,213 --> 00:30:28,710
Scott: It's like, where's the GameCube four swords?

624
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:29,577
Rym: Hello?

625
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:38,530
Rym: It goes back to the fact that Nintendo recently has been very bad at understanding what it is that makes something popular.

626
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,150
Rym: I mean, look at that WarioWare game.

627
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:40,710
Rym: They're like, alright.

628
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,490
Rym: Clearly people loved WarioWare for the GameCube.

629
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,410
Rym: Clearly this was a fantastic game.

630
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:50,930
Rym: And clearly what they liked was the single player playing of the micro games.

631
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:53,350
Rym: They probably didn't care about that multiplayer.

632
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,989
Scott: Maybe the Japanese people like that.

633
00:30:55,472 --> 00:30:55,685
Scott: Yeah.

634
00:30:56,852 --> 00:30:58,550
Scott: Yeah, we've said the same thing about Nintendo.

635
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,050
Scott: The Wii U is really just more of the same from them.

636
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,090
Scott: It hasn't changed anything.

637
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:03,689
Scott: We'll find out when it comes out for sure.

638
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:07,270
Scott: But the 3DS is definitely carrying the torch there.

639
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,290
Rym: I just have so little faith in this.

640
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,207
Rym: And it's funny because...

641
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,330
Scott: And the thing is, some of the games they announced I'm kind of interested in.

642
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,727
Scott: I wouldn't mind playing Luigi's Mansion 2 on 3DS.

643
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,629
Scott: But not for the amount of money it costs.

644
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,262
Scott: It's like a $10 game, not a $50 game.

645
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,990
Scott: But the price isn't going to drop forever.

646
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,488
Rym: Go back and listen to GeekNights when the Wii was coming out.

647
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,210
Rym: And we talked a lot about the potential.

648
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:29,330
Rym: Yeah, we'll get it.

649
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,330
Rym: Because they'll do cool stuff with this.

650
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:35,490
Rym: They're going to do the cool stuff like they tried with the GameCube on the Wii.

651
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,550
Rym: They're going to push the boundaries.

652
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,050
Rym: You know what?

653
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:37,626
Scott: They didn't do it.

654
00:31:38,392 --> 00:31:41,949
Rym: I have no faith that Nintendo is going to do anything interesting with this console whatsoever.

655
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,537
Scott: It's like on the GameCube.

656
00:31:42,557 --> 00:31:44,129
Scott: they were really trying with the software.

657
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,790
Scott: Pac-Man verse, right?

658
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:47,169
Scott: But then they just gave up on it.

659
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,170
Rym: Well, they were very sad during that time.

660
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,530
Rym: Because they learned that nobody actually wanted those good games.

661
00:31:53,574 --> 00:31:55,529
Rym: Or they thought nobody wanted it.

662
00:31:56,192 --> 00:31:58,469
Rym: Or they thought nobody was actually going to make those games.

663
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,010
Scott: But then they locked out all the people who would have made those games.

664
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:01,450
Scott: They're people.

665
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,430
Scott: They don't talk to anyone.

666
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,429
Scott: And you can't talk to them.

667
00:32:05,112 --> 00:32:07,950
Scott: That's the other thing that the big companies get wrong.

668
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,409
Scott: Microsoft actually talks to people.

669
00:32:09,631 --> 00:32:13,490
Rym: Yeah, Microsoft's community management is, bar none, the best of the three consoles.

670
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,270
Scott: They just don't talk to people.

671
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,570
Scott: They don't ask us what we want.

672
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,710
Scott: They're just Japanese people.

673
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:20,950
Scott: Apple doesn't need to ask people what they want.

674
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,229
Scott: They tell people what they want.

675
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:24,970
Scott: But Nintendo doesn't have that skill.

676
00:32:25,854 --> 00:32:26,428
Scott: I don't know.

677
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:30,770
Scott: But the one thing that definitely has changed on our side is that we're not in college.

678
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:35,986
Scott: I feel like if I was in college, that the Nintendo stuff would still be...

679
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:37,490
Rym: I think that.

680
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:44,350
Rym: But then I look at what would we have played if we were today, if we were still in college, we could just get four people and sit down from the Wii.

681
00:32:44,911 --> 00:32:47,030
Rym: We'd be playing Smash Brothers or the new Mario.

682
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:47,510
Rym: Yeah.

683
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:48,429
Rym: And nothing else.

684
00:32:48,731 --> 00:32:49,430
Rym: Maybe the sports games.

685
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,930
Scott: They're coming out with Mario Party 9.

686
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,056
Scott: Eh.

687
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,709
Scott: There's Mario Sports Mix.

688
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:53,396
Rym: Yeah.

689
00:32:54,971 --> 00:33:07,470
Scott: There's quite a few games that are on the Wii that are the sort of simultaneous everyone-in-the-room games that you could play if you have a whole bunch of people that we can't really play because we don't have that kind of environment anymore.

690
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:07,668
Rym: We could.

691
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,530
Rym: We could get those people if we wanted to.

692
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,049
Rym: We just don't.

693
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:25,070
Scott: Plus, it does look like the Wii U, while you're only going to have one of the Wii U controllers at a time, there are still going to be some games along the lines of Pac-Man first where you only need one and the other three people will use Wiimotes or whatever.

694
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:31,970
Rym: Yeah, now how many of those games will actually be as good as Pac-Man first, which was to this day one of the best games ever released on the GameCube?

695
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:32,989
Scott: Maybe one.

696
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:33,640
Rym: Yeah.

697
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:35,389
Rym: That's exactly what's going to happen.

698
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:39,410
Rym: I cannot express to you how little faith I have in this console.

699
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:45,910
Rym: So, we had a lot to talk about, so it took us a while to get to this, but we ran into a problem.

700
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:46,989
Rym: I don't know.

701
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,449
Rym: Probably like our senior year of RIT.

702
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,390
Scott: Well, a lot of it.

703
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,809
Scott: This problem has existed for quite a long time, well before we encountered it.

704
00:33:54,912 --> 00:33:55,021
Scott: Yes.

705
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:55,869
Scott: We knew about it.

706
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:03,790
Rym: We call it in panels, for those of you who never get to see us live at conventions, the air hockey conundrum, because air hockey is perhaps the best example of this.

707
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,689
Scott: No, fighting games are the best example of this.

708
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:10,649
Rym: I think air hockey is a more universal, I think more people have the air hockey problem than the fighting game problem.

709
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,630
Scott: I think more people understand the fighting, gamers know the fighting game problem.

710
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,329
Rym: They're both the same.

711
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:16,849
Scott: Anyway, let's discuss the problem.

712
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:28,029
Rym: Alright, so for us specifically, this is kind of like a very personal show, we did not know about Euro games and hardcore board games and game theory and any of that until we got to RIT.

713
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:32,726
Rym: I mean, at RIT, as freshmen, one day some guy was like, "Hey, you want to play

714
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:33,230
Rym: Settlers?".

715
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,978
Rym: And I'm like, "What the fuck is

716
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:34,484
Rym: Settlers?".

717
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,728
Scott: And I sat down.

718
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:47,946
Scott: For me, it was like people all around at RWAG talked about playing Settlers, and I just never played it because I was always playing RPGs instead, and then eventually everyone kept talking about the Settlers and playing the Settlers.

719
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,949
Rym: Yup, because they invited me to play once and I sat down.

720
00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:51,250
Scott: One day I finally played the Settlers.

721
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,210
Rym: There's all these hexes and cubes and I played it and it was like this revelation.

722
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:58,850
Rym: I remember after the game was done, I was like, "That was the best game I've ever played.

723
00:34:59,371 --> 00:34:59,575
Scott: Fuck

724
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:00,145
Scott: Monopoly.".

725
00:35:01,195 --> 00:35:02,370
Rym: And it really set us off.

726
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:11,649
Rym: And for a long time, we were kind of in this perfect storm of gaming because our whole front row crew got into Euro gaming at the same time.

727
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:14,150
Rym: So we all progressed together.

728
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,569
Rym: I remember El Grande was one of the first games we got on our own.

729
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:19,990
Rym: I bought that shit when I couldn't even afford food.

730
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,528
Rym: I spent like 45 bucks on it.

731
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,389
Rym: Yeah, at RIT.

732
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,130
Rym: That was the first German board game I ever bought.

733
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,090
Scott: I don't know why you did it when you couldn't afford food.

734
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:31,609
Rym: Because I got more enjoyment out of El Grande than I did out of food.

735
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,970
Scott: Than steak on French bread?

736
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:35,310
Rym: Steak on French bread was like five bucks.

737
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:41,730
Scott: You could have gotten nine steak on French breads instead of one El Grande.

738
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:47,750
Rym: So we progressed and we played with our crew and with other people at RWAG.

739
00:35:48,372 --> 00:35:49,730
Rym: And we played online.

740
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,710
Rym: And we started studying the game.

741
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:58,150
Rym: At one point I remember sitting there when I was bored playing the game idly online against myself to try to figure out strategy.

742
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:03,290
Rym: We started reading facts and learning about tripodting versus brickwood or grain sheep.

743
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:05,187
Rym: We got really into it.

744
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:11,069
Rym: So fast forward a couple of years having played these games almost every goddamn day for years.

745
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,810
Scott: Yeah, the summer where we played Puerto Rico three times a day almost every day.

746
00:36:15,193 --> 00:36:26,950
Rym: The summer after our sophomore year of RIT Scott and I and our friend Alex a crew member, we all lived in apartments right next to each other on campus over the summer where rent was half back then.

747
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,490
Rym: I don't think they even let people do that anymore.

748
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,270
Rym: So we lived on campus in our apartment.

749
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,481
Rym: We had like, I had a job technically.

750
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,908
Rym: I went to that sub shop.

751
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:37,160
Scott: I was taking classes at the time.

752
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:39,889
Scott: But there were very few of them.

753
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:46,690
Rym: We pretty much had infinite free time and we would sit down almost every day and play Puerto Rico and play Puerto Rico.

754
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,430
Rym: And one day we played it like ten times just in a row, just nonstop.

755
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,009
Scott: Yeah, I sort of regret it.

756
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:55,684
Scott: Like if I could go back and tell myself I'd be like, "Don't waste the time, make something you

757
00:36:55,764 --> 00:36:56,106
Scott: asshole.".

758
00:36:56,751 --> 00:37:01,230
Rym: No, but had we not done that we wouldn't understand game theory like we do now.

759
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:01,715
Scott: I know, right?

760
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:02,606
Scott: It's such a difficult thing.

761
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,630
Rym: That's why you can't go back and relive college because now I'm older and wiser and I wouldn't spend my time dicking around.

762
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,389
Scott: I wouldn't have wasted my time if I had the time to waste now.

763
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:15,650
Rym: But the time I wasted was the only reason I have such a good memory of that time.

764
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,309
Rym: The wasted time was the best time.

765
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,969
Scott: I know, wasted youth.

766
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,810
Rym: Better by far than a wise and productive old age.

767
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,319
Rym: So that summer it really happened.

768
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,970
Rym: We played that game to death.

769
00:37:28,271 --> 00:37:39,124
Rym: And then the next year we started mostly playing board games with our own kind of tight-knit crew because all the other people in the gaming club really weren't that good at the games anymore compared to us.

770
00:37:41,253 --> 00:37:42,750
Rym: They'd take forever to take their turns.

771
00:37:43,953 --> 00:37:47,010
Rym: And it was like Kellas going out among the world-born.

772
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,095
Rym: They'd just craft.

773
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,200
Rym: And I'm like, "Okay, captain.

774
00:37:51,764 --> 00:37:52,066
Rym: Thanks.".

775
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:56,110
Scott: I think people understand the fighting game problem more.

776
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,130
Scott: So you have a group of people you all love to play Street Fighter.

777
00:37:59,951 --> 00:38:03,690
Scott: But one guy goes and practices and he actually becomes really good at Street Fighter.

778
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,508
Rym: Doesn't take much.

779
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:09,288
Scott: Meanwhile, so now basically nobody ever beats him and you can't even hit him.

780
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:19,029
Scott: I practiced a little bit and at the height of my practicing I was beating my friends who had never practiced at all with just jab.

781
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,110
Scott: Literally I could just jab and I would win.

782
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:27,110
Scott: And there's still some people I know that are as good and better than me.

783
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,949
Scott: There's plenty of them because I'm not good at all.

784
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:30,809
Scott: Wyatt is way better.

785
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,449
Scott: He still plays, I think, all the time.

786
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:42,330
Scott: But the point is I'm still better than a lot of people and there's no even point in playing against them because the skill gap is so wide.

787
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,370
Scott: If you're Michael Jordan are you gonna play basketball with your family?

788
00:38:48,223 --> 00:38:48,509
Rym: I would.

789
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,390
Rym: It'd be like that John Hodgkin's thing.

790
00:38:51,651 --> 00:38:52,249
Rym: The Hodgkins.

791
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:54,177
Scott: The thing we went to.

792
00:38:56,093 --> 00:39:01,646
Scott: But it's like, okay, you might get some fun out of it in some fashion but it's not like.

793
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:06,310
Scott: this doesn't give you that competitive gaming thing.

794
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,630
Scott: You have to play in the NBA if you're Michael Jordan.

795
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:18,969
Rym: So you get into the situation where you are better than most of your friends or you and your small circle of friends are all super good but none of you can play with anyone else.

796
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:27,488
Rym: Because everyone else is either the tiny minority of uber elite players who either you're to them what everyone else is to you.

797
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:34,209
Scott: Yeah, like, oh man, I just own all my friends at Quake and then you go to the Quake world and you don't even get one frag.

798
00:39:35,113 --> 00:39:37,349
Scott: It's like, oh, you're in this sort of no zone in the middle.

799
00:39:38,273 --> 00:39:40,590
Scott: And you can try to play online, but even then.

800
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:50,430
Rym: Now board games in particular, and this is where it really affects us, are the top is not that accessible especially because not many of these games yet are easily played online.

801
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,230
Scott: A lot of them are playable online.

802
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,289
Scott: That's changing rapidly, though.

803
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:56,590
Scott: Even though many of them are playable online.

804
00:39:56,651 --> 00:40:18,729
Scott: there's that Brett Spielwelt site that's been around for a long time, and I know Days of Wonder has places you can play online but the communities online are rather small, and playing online is not the same experience as playing at a table and pretty much all of them universally have shitty user interfaces and I consider them to basically be so worthless as to be, might as well not even exist.

805
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:26,570
Rym: So, we're gonna sound a little bit full of ourselves for the next few minutes because basically, we left RIT which was like this den of geekery.

806
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:36,070
Rym: We're having that problem, but only a little bit, because I remember later on, we started going to Richmond's more elite board gaming night, where everyone was actually super skilled.

807
00:40:37,511 --> 00:40:43,699
Rym: Imagine there's a gaming club and then there's a separate much more hardcore gaming club.

808
00:40:44,103 --> 00:40:53,758
Rym: Imagine if there was a fighting game club in your college, and then a subset of that club was the "we are all the best at Street Fighter" club, and you just joined that.

809
00:40:54,344 --> 00:41:02,564
Rym: So, we leave college, we go our separate ways and we all come back together in the Mid-Hudson Valley and, you know, we wanted to play some games, it was just me and Scott.

810
00:41:02,665 --> 00:41:06,269
Rym: for a while and other than when people came down on weekends we really couldn't play any games.

811
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:17,415
Rym: So, we join a local gaming group and those guys were nice, it was fun times, good god could none of them play games.

812
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:25,679
Scott: No, it's just like they didn't know how to take their turn quickly right, so you would sit there and basically a game that would have taken us 90 minutes.

813
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:33,838
Scott: tops took not only 45 minutes, half hour to teach, but then there would be players that would just take forever on their turn, literally.

814
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:39,738
Scott: So you'd be sitting there basically wasting hours and you can't just leave the game and dick everyone over because then you're a dick.

815
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:40,970
Rym: The thing is you're going to win anyway.

816
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,029
Rym: I mean, I don't think we ever lost a game to those guys.

817
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:55,521
Scott: No, but it's like one of us always won, there were two other skilled guys, but there was always unskilled guys who would take forever and even if they didn't take forever they were just so low skilled they would just get rolled.

818
00:41:55,702 --> 00:42:07,904
Rym: Which would have been fine if they learned and tried or if they learned from their mistakes and got better as we played games again, but instead they would argue, like we were playing that Timbuktu game, which the first round, I remember.

819
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:14,350
Rym: I sat there and I looked at it and I did a little bit of math and I realized exactly what the game was and I played perfectly optimally from round one.

820
00:42:14,753 --> 00:42:20,891
Rym: you figured out what the game was immediately after the first round and played optimally for the whole rest of the game.

821
00:42:20,912 --> 00:42:21,356
Rym: and you know what?

822
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:23,578
Rym: I beat you by one point at the end of the game.

823
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:30,990
Scott: Yeah, because I played a round to figure it out rather than just observing and trying to do math I played the round to figure it out.

824
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,490
Rym: So basically all the crew people who were there were within a point of each other.

825
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,760
Scott: It was me, you, Alex, one, two, three.

826
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:46,890
Rym: We dominated the game and everyone else, it wasn't that they were bad and that they took forever on their turn but that was true, but I remember when I said after the first round "Oh, I think I solved it" and Scott was like "Yeah, I think you're right".

827
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:47,967
Rym: and Alex was like "Yeah, I got it".

828
00:42:48,656 --> 00:42:51,080
Rym: and they tried to argue that "What do you mean you can't solve a game?

829
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,966
Rym: What are you talking

830
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:52,248
Rym: about?".

831
00:42:52,632 --> 00:42:55,625
Rym: and we proceeded to argue and show them "Look, here's the math.

832
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:56,938
Rym: We could even just stop playing.

833
00:42:57,019 --> 00:42:58,860
Rym: I can tell you how the whole rest of the game is going to go right

834
00:42:58,901 --> 00:42:59,144
Rym: now.".

835
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:06,010
Rym: So, maybe an outlier I mean, maybe we're just in the land of no Street Fighter players.

836
00:43:06,071 --> 00:43:15,270
Scott: Well, I don't think there's that many people who are that good at board games particularly but there's plenty of other kinds of games that we're not so good at.

837
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:21,189
Rym: No, no, but the thing is it's a self-selected sample, like the people who seek out a fighting game club.

838
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:25,028
Scott: Yeah, if we went to those weird board game championships in Pennsylvania, how would we do?

839
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:33,189
Scott: Well, I'm starting to believe perfectly honestly that we would do really god damn well Yeah, I have no idea and those things are kind of weird and I really want to go to them.

840
00:43:34,616 --> 00:43:39,610
Rym: I always want to do the board game tournaments at PAX but they always take way too long.

841
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:40,890
Scott: Yeah, that's another thing, right?

842
00:43:41,131 --> 00:43:59,589
Scott: I could go in a tournament, but those tournaments are open to everyone and you're going to have to play, what, two or three games of Puerto Rico, which with good players will be 90 minutes times three maybe three hours, three, four, five hours at most, probably at least three, four, five hours and you might get a slow player in round one six hours, seven hours.

843
00:43:59,994 --> 00:44:08,630
Rym: it's like, dude, seven hours, I could have played two RPGs, dude I mean, I played in some Settlers tournaments and they were just really boring, and then once it got to all skilled players it was random, because Settlers were random.

844
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:11,690
Scott: The thing is, we're going on so many PAXes already.

845
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:19,149
Scott: I'm thinking of, like, well it's another PAX, presumably I'm going to be going to tens of PAXes in my life, right?

846
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:25,366
Scott: I don't think I have a problem spending a day of PAX just playing a whole bunch of RPGs.

847
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:35,330
Scott: I think for the next PAX West I'm going to pick a day, once I see the schedule, and also our personal schedule, and I'm going to make a day of RPG and schedule.

848
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:40,470
Rym: Well, there might be things in the works for PAX East related to that Maybe, we'll see.

849
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,674
Rym: So, basically we're running into this problem, where now we're?

850
00:44:45,694 --> 00:44:53,170
Rym: in New York, and we figured, alright, New York will find some gamers, and we hang out a lot with the NerdNYC crew, and they're a great crew, they're really into games, they're really dedicated, they're great guys.

851
00:44:53,231 --> 00:44:54,027
Rym: I love hanging out with them.

852
00:44:55,051 --> 00:45:01,510
Scott: Even there, I just Yeah, I mean, there are hardcore peoples in that group who we can play with, there's quite a few of them.

853
00:45:02,154 --> 00:45:07,289
Scott: I played a really good game of Kalis actually two board game nights ago.

854
00:45:07,734 --> 00:45:15,828
Scott: I didn't go to the most recent one, but the one two, yeah, a few ago I played an awesome game of Kalis, people were really good and I won, by a lot Of course.

855
00:45:17,912 --> 00:45:23,170
Scott: But, because you're just going to get into a game with whoever happens to be there you know, it's kind of random.

856
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:31,629
Scott: you might end up playing a game with people who are not so skilled, also because a lot of people there have different taste in games, and are looking for different things.

857
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:42,290
Scott: most of the time, I don't play serious games there, a lot of times I'll end up playing some kind of light-hearted game that isn't so serious, it doesn't take so long that isn't hard to learn

858
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:43,869
Rym: Like jungle speed, or spotted

859
00:45:44,591 --> 00:45:45,840
Scott: Yeah, things like that, things that

860
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:46,445
Rym: are

861
00:45:46,565 --> 00:45:55,570
Scott: quick to learn and quick to play, and it's like well, that's fun and all, but I really lately just have a hankering to play this for serious, long games.

862
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:56,743
Rym: What doesn't help is that the venue.

863
00:45:57,531 --> 00:46:02,522
Rym: I love the venue, but it's really where these board games, it's kind of like this raucous coffeehouse bar,

864
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:03,150
Scott: it's very loud

865
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:06,949
Rym: it's loud, and it's dark which is kind of like the death

866
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:08,197
Scott: of

867
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:09,049
Rym: a game like Puerto Rico

868
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:16,410
Scott: and cramped, yeah, it's like you need to have big tables, with lots of space, where it's relatively quiet you know, like a packed stable top room.

869
00:46:18,035 --> 00:46:24,570
Scott: so it's very hard you know, even when there are people about to get a serious game going on, and there's also NerdNYC also has recess.

870
00:46:25,151 --> 00:46:29,830
Rym: Now this is where, I mean, I'm gonna keep going to the board game nights but I've changed my idiom.

871
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:39,189
Rym: when I go to the board game night, I'm never gonna go into it thinking, I'm gonna play Puerto Rico, I'm gonna go into it thinking I'm gonna have a grilled cheese and a beer play a couple of light games and then go home.

872
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,573
Rym: Really?

873
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:43,170
Scott: I'm gonna bring one serious game every time that I wanna play.

874
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:47,030
Scott: I'm not gonna rely on anyone else, right and I'm gonna say, I need X people for this game.

875
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:47,556
Scott: we're playing it.

876
00:46:47,697 --> 00:46:48,810
Rym: Well, here's what you need to do.

877
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:52,117
Rym: we need to post ahead of time what that game is every week every time we go.

878
00:46:52,178 --> 00:47:02,422
Rym: Oh yeah, do more 4, that's a good idea That's really, we gotta get more in the forum and we find the other people who are just as stupid and hardcore about the games as we are, and just play serious games with them.

879
00:47:02,462 --> 00:47:02,867
Scott: Let's do it.

880
00:47:03,594 --> 00:47:09,170
Scott: But yeah, but recess, so we tell you to go to recess quite often and recess is this Saturday?

881
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:10,361
Rym: Uh, yeah.

882
00:47:10,606 --> 00:47:12,229
Scott: Yeah And you should totally go to it.

883
00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:14,269
Rym: I'm going to stop going though.

884
00:47:14,653 --> 00:47:16,430
Scott: Well, I don't know if I'm gonna stop going all together.

885
00:47:16,853 --> 00:47:20,441
Rym: Well, I'm going to go if I ever remember to sign up to run a game in town.

886
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:26,095
Scott: Yeah, but basically here's the thing with recess, right, is that you can go and you pay $20.

887
00:47:26,095 --> 00:47:27,835
Scott: if you're running a game, you pay zero dollars.

888
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,756
Scott: And then there's two sessions before lunch and after lunch, they're each four hours.

889
00:47:31,796 --> 00:47:39,069
Rym: Now this is the trouble, some of the sessions are board games, and I've never finished a board game in the four hours because people don't take their goddamn turn.

890
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:41,190
Scott: Yeah, uh, because you're not gonna.

891
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:45,350
Scott: you know, because of the four hour session you're not gonna pick some lighthearted game.

892
00:47:45,411 --> 00:47:53,839
Scott: it's always gonna be a serious game but some serious games take even more than four hours, especially when you have to spend time to teach it cause there's.

893
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:57,130
Scott: no, you can't just deny people entry to your game because they don't know how to play, right?

894
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:01,937
Rym: Well, if you look at old gaming cons usually there would be two ratings on any gaming event.

895
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,767
Rym: The first rating would be how difficult is this game?

896
00:48:04,807 --> 00:48:06,119
Rym: Like how complicated is it?

897
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:11,070
Rym: The second rating would be how much foreknowledge must you have to be allowed to join this game?

898
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:14,644
Scott: I've seen a lot of cons still have that, where they say how much foreknowledge do you need?

899
00:48:14,947 --> 00:48:18,282
Scott: But you know what, I've never seen any event ever that didn't say all welcome.

900
00:48:18,606 --> 00:48:24,153
Rym: I have in fact, I've played in games, I've played in a D&D tournament at that.

901
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:31,948
Rym: you had to bring characters already made that followed certain requirements and you had to bring all your own materials and they just started you playing D&D.

902
00:48:32,331 --> 00:48:35,321
Scott: I don't know if anyone does things like that anymore.

903
00:48:35,422 --> 00:48:36,229
Rym: I feel like people do.

904
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,655
Scott: I've never seen it at any gaming cons.

905
00:48:38,978 --> 00:48:44,795
Rym: But basically the recesses as great as they are, I usually end up I'm not willing to stand in line for like an hour.

906
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:48,656
Scott: Basically they put all the games up on the wall and you have to sign up and it's first come first serve.

907
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:49,850
Scott: so you have to wait in a line.

908
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:53,627
Scott: you basically have to fight and be aggressive and annoying to get to the front of the line.

909
00:48:53,647 --> 00:48:55,505
Rym: And there's always like one game I want to be in.

910
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:58,998
Rym: It's always like oh there's one paranoia game or one lacuna game and that fills up immediately.

911
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:03,159
Scott: Yeah, so unless you're at the front of the line, you're not going to get in the game that you want to get in.

912
00:49:03,562 --> 00:49:04,289
Scott: And then what do you do?

913
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:15,909
Scott: You're going to, you know, you spent 20 bucks so you're going to wait, are you going to sign up for a game that wasn't your, that you're not really that excited about and hope that it's good because you can't just bail on it if it sucks because then you're a jerk to everyone else.

914
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:21,809
Scott: So you're basically committing to four hours of being trapped, possibly being trapped in a game you don't want to play.

915
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,178
Rym: My experience has pretty much been the last few recesses.

916
00:49:25,198 --> 00:49:29,179
Rym: The first session, I'll fight and I'll do the BS and I'll get into something pretty good.

917
00:49:30,007 --> 00:49:33,826
Rym: And then the second session, I'm usually stuck not playing anything.

918
00:49:33,947 --> 00:49:34,150
Rym: Yeah.

919
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:39,703
Scott: And usually the thing is, that's four hour, four hours, two four hour sessions with an hour lunch in the middle.

920
00:49:39,723 --> 00:49:41,157
Scott: That's nine hours.

921
00:49:41,804 --> 00:49:46,975
Scott: With the people that are good, if I could get together Dude, we could play Puerto Rico more than ten times.

922
00:49:47,036 --> 00:50:00,590
Scott: Right, if I could get together a group of myself, Rym, and three other awesome people, we could play Puerto Rico, Le Havre, Calistini, like five or six games in that time period that are all hardcore and awesome.

923
00:50:01,053 --> 00:50:04,470
Rym: Or we could play like two solid indie RPG, like one-offs.

924
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:11,964
Scott: Yeah, so I mean like I might go to recess just because even though it's not a great, you know, for me at least, it's not a great time.

925
00:50:11,984 --> 00:50:13,217
Rym: Well that's the important thing.

926
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:13,763
Scott: Recess is great.

927
00:50:13,783 --> 00:50:15,198
Scott: For other people it's still great.

928
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:15,884
Scott: But it's great.

929
00:50:15,904 --> 00:50:17,842
Scott: Especially people who can't get their RPG on.

930
00:50:17,903 --> 00:50:18,286
Rym: Well that's it.

931
00:50:18,387 --> 00:50:21,519
Rym: Recess and board game nights are great for two kinds of people.

932
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:27,094
Rym: One, the people who don't have a large enough local crew who's into their games, which is a big problem for a lot of people.

933
00:50:27,115 --> 00:50:33,842
Scott: Right, it's like you really want to play an RPG but, you know, you can't make it to a convention and you don't have any people locally.

934
00:50:33,862 --> 00:50:37,763
Scott: Well you can go to recess, sign up for an RPG four hours and play it.

935
00:50:37,843 --> 00:50:46,189
Scott: And if you're so RPG deprived, even if you don't get into your top choice of the really popular RPG, you'll probably still be thrilled with whatever one you get into.

936
00:50:47,534 --> 00:50:51,274
Rym: But two, it's good for people who don't have space to play.

937
00:50:51,295 --> 00:50:56,309
Rym: Like even if you have friends, like a lot of the Nerd NYC people are friends with us and with each other and, you know, it's a social group.

938
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,263
Rym: So, it's New York.

939
00:50:58,283 --> 00:50:59,434
Rym: A lot of people have tiny apartments.

940
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,103
Rym: If you need a space to play, things like this are great for that.

941
00:51:02,669 --> 00:51:03,802
Rym: But we have spaces to play.

942
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:04,410
Rym: We're really just.

943
00:51:05,112 --> 00:51:13,657
Rym: basically we had this revelation a few weeks ago that we have everything we need to run our own kind of bi-weekly, like, hardcore gaming night.

944
00:51:13,758 --> 00:51:20,524
Scott: Yeah, we just need to get, the problem is even our close friends who are really into games, they don't commit and be, they're not reliable.

945
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,615
Scott: They don't show up every single, you know, it's like, let's play serious, you know.

946
00:51:23,635 --> 00:51:23,979
Rym: No, yeah they do.

947
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:25,293
Rym: The problem there is much more simple.

948
00:51:25,556 --> 00:51:30,627
Rym: We can't do stuff like that on weekends because if you have a big gathering on a weekend everybody can show up.

949
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:34,470
Rym: Which then, you know, alright, twelve people showed up not playing board games.

950
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:38,041
Scott: Yeah, it's like you try to play a serious game when all those people are there.

951
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:40,263
Scott: Well, it's like, oh, these people don't want to play a serious game.

952
00:51:40,283 --> 00:51:41,578
Rym: Well, no, it's everyone's social eyes.

953
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,469
Rym: I mean, I'm in that boat.

954
00:51:43,313 --> 00:51:44,689
Rym: If I got a big crew, I want to hang out.

955
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,181
Scott: Yeah, but I want to play a serious game.

956
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:48,426
Rym: That's why we're making a dedicated serious gaming night.

957
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:52,790
Scott: Yeah, we got to do, you know, space, look, we plan this time for serious gaming.

958
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:57,636
Scott: Because a lot of times we'll get together and some people want a serious game and some people don't and it just doesn't happen.

959
00:51:57,959 --> 00:52:00,262
Scott: But if we say, look, this is going to be serious gaming.

960
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:01,798
Scott: Don't show up if you're not into it.

961
00:52:02,304 --> 00:52:02,890
Scott: Then it'll happen.

962
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:10,326
Rym: Yep, so basically what we've come down to doing is shutting, you know, all our hardcore gaming.

963
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:14,369
Rym: I'm pretty much just going to get from the people I already know, at least for a while.

964
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:23,034
Rym: Because the best gaming experiences I've ever had are still, you know, my tight-knit group of super hardcore gamers playing super hardcore games until we've solved them.

965
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:26,710
Rym: And I haven't had that experience since I left college.

966
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,470
Scott: Yeah, and you know, I've just been sort of really hankering for it lately.

967
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:36,165
Scott: So I think, you know, I might go, I'm not, you know, this recess, it's sort of like we took advantage of the fact that recess was there.

968
00:52:36,185 --> 00:52:40,004
Scott: Because like, well, look, everyone was planning on playing games this day anyway.

969
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:43,748
Scott: Let's just divert them to our place, you know, a select few.

970
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:46,350
Scott: Because it happens to be a time that was set aside.

971
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,550
Scott: But I think for future recesses, I'll actually go to them.

972
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,720
Rym: Well, I'm going to go and run stuff.

973
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,256
Rym: I'm just going to keep an eye out and actually...

974
00:52:51,276 --> 00:52:56,150
Scott: Because, you know, I'll consider it spreading of gaming and I won't be expecting to play gaming.

975
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:04,916
Scott: You know, and then we'll, maybe like the, you know, if it's not the double day recess, if it's the one day, we'll use the second day for our own gaming or, you know, I don't know.

976
00:53:05,422 --> 00:53:06,129
Rym: Yeah, we'll figure it out.

977
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:10,490
Scott: But yeah, I mean, you know, if you're, you know, not in the same boat as us, right?

978
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:11,621
Scott: It's sort of tricky, right?

979
00:53:11,642 --> 00:53:13,040
Scott: Let's say you're okay at some games.

980
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:17,077
Scott: Well, do you risk leveling up, right?

981
00:53:17,097 --> 00:53:19,036
Scott: Do you want to self improve?

982
00:53:19,339 --> 00:53:31,970
Rym: When we do that panel, How to Win in Games, we have this huge, you know, half joking but half serious disclaimer about how if you actually pay attention to games, like, you play a game like Puerto Rico or Calus, and you actually really pay attention and really try to win.

983
00:53:32,313 --> 00:53:33,302
Rym: And learn from your mistakes.

984
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:38,210
Rym: You will very rapidly become so much better than everyone else around you at that one particular game.

985
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:43,221
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you get Street Fighter and you like it, should you practice and improve your skills at it?

986
00:53:43,302 --> 00:54:01,041
Scott: Because that is a rewarding task that is of self improvement, but at the same time, it can also be a great sacrifice of enjoyment if no one you know does the same thing and you can't find, you know, enough hardcore Street Fighter community to get involved in, you know?

987
00:54:01,102 --> 00:54:07,868
Scott: It's like, unless you have like, say, Chinatown Arcade which is not open anymore, but I think it moved and I think they still have fighting games over there.

988
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,348
Scott: You know, what do you do?

989
00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:14,189
Scott: You can play online, sure, but it's, you know, that's not really it.

990
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,290
Scott: Can you make it out to the tournament?

991
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,321
Scott: Are you tournament level?

992
00:54:17,624 --> 00:54:18,877
Scott: Or are you just better than all your friends?

993
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:32,290
Rym: There's a secondary issue with space in that every gaming con I've ever been to, except for some very, like, tiny ones out of the way, has terrible space just because space is expensive.

994
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:33,563
Rym: Not just in New York, but anywhere.

995
00:54:33,623 --> 00:54:43,906
Rym: So usually RPGs are in very loud rooms and even at recess, as great as the games are, the rooms are so loud that it's very tiring to play in the RPGs.

996
00:54:43,987 --> 00:54:44,676
Rym: I'm very loud.

997
00:54:44,737 --> 00:54:45,630
Rym: I have to lose my voice.

998
00:54:46,672 --> 00:54:49,342
Rym: I'm sick of playing games in very loud rooms.

999
00:54:49,423 --> 00:54:50,392
Rym: Even PAX has that problem.

1000
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:54,170
Rym: Like PAX Tabletop at PAX East, it was a great experience.

1001
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,079
Scott: Well, at East, I like the West better because it's a bunch of smaller rooms.

1002
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,735
Rym: But like PAX East, it was something to see, such a big room, but at the same time, it was impossible to play games in there.

1003
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:04,130
Scott: That's why we went to the other room.

1004
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:05,810
Rym: Yeah, we had basically our private tabletop.

1005
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:08,110
Scott: Well, anyway, anyone else could have come in there.

1006
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:08,679
Rym: No one did.

1007
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:09,270
Rym: It was just us.

1008
00:55:13,211 --> 00:55:16,392
Rym: So, we're not abandoning, you know, because we've said something about this.

1009
00:55:16,432 --> 00:55:18,675
Rym: No, we're not abandoning all the Nerd NYC events.

1010
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:27,890
Rym: We're just, we've realized that what we want out of gaming, primarily, when we're players, is not something we can get from really any public venue.

1011
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:32,190
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, it's something no one can really get from any public venue, right?

1012
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:37,097
Scott: If you're Michael Jordan, right, and you want to play competitive, hardcore basketball.

1013
00:55:37,137 --> 00:55:45,639
Rym: If you go to, say, MagFest, a gaming con, and you want to get your Street Fighter on, there are a bunch of hardcore people and it's really easy to get it on.

1014
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:51,279
Scott: Yeah, but it's not the same level as the EVO tournament, which is the big Street Fighter tournament.

1015
00:55:51,441 --> 00:55:52,612
Rym: Yeah, but maybe you don't need that.

1016
00:55:53,056 --> 00:55:53,803
Scott: Maybe you don't need that.

1017
00:55:53,823 --> 00:56:01,198
Rym: RPGs just, you can't get away with, like, conventions tend to have large, loud spaces, and yet, RPGs specifically require out of the way quiet places.

1018
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:06,590
Rym: And I think that's why a lot of the good RPGs that go on at cons happen outside of the con in hotel rooms.

1019
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:07,390
Scott: Possibly.

1020
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:21,830
Scott: But yeah, there's just, you know, should you sacrifice self-improvement to maintain enjoyment, or, you know, should you, like, is it worth it to put in the extra effort to find the community once you have self-improved?

1021
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,950
Rym: No, no, no, I'll make a very, here's a simpler thing.

1022
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:25,481
Rym: It's like a Counter-Strike server.

1023
00:56:25,905 --> 00:56:36,150
Rym: Do you play with your friends and with strangers on the pubs, because you can just do that, or do you give up on that and only play on your password-protected server?

1024
00:56:36,513 --> 00:56:38,754
Rym: that only the people you want to play with are there?

1025
00:56:39,016 --> 00:56:42,836
Scott: But then, even then, you play on your password-protected server with your clan, right?

1026
00:56:43,543 --> 00:56:46,655
Scott: And then you really want to play, but no one happens to be online right now.

1027
00:56:46,998 --> 00:56:47,200
Rym: Yep.

1028
00:56:47,544 --> 00:56:48,210
Rym: So then what do you do?

1029
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,696
Rym: Do you go to the public thing, or do you just not play?

1030
00:56:50,716 --> 00:56:53,464
Rym: There's also-- And then there's the third path of joining the clan.

1031
00:56:53,484 --> 00:57:03,790
Scott: There's also a reverse problem, though, that is, that we don't recognize often, which is a lot of people say, like, I know a lot of people have tried to play Counter-Strike, and they hate it because they just die instantly.

1032
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:04,511
Scott: Right?

1033
00:57:04,632 --> 00:57:06,410
Scott: Even on pubs, they just get killed constantly.

1034
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:07,218
Scott: They can't do anything.

1035
00:57:07,238 --> 00:57:08,472
Rym: That was me when I first started playing.

1036
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:13,750
Scott: Yeah, because their skill level is too low to even play with the general population.

1037
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:14,634
Scott: Right?

1038
00:57:14,877 --> 00:57:16,756
Scott: So, you know, what do you do in that sort of situation?

1039
00:57:16,776 --> 00:57:18,310
Rym: Well, that's why I'm going to still keep going.

1040
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,918
Scott: A lot of those people, what they do is they just give up, rather than try to self-improve.

1041
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:28,009
Rym: That's why I'm going to keep going to the NerdNYC recesses, but I'm going to only go to run games.

1042
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:31,321
Rym: Because, one, if I'm running a game, I know exactly what it's going to be.

1043
00:57:31,362 --> 00:57:33,281
Rym: I'm not going to be stuck in a game I don't want to play.

1044
00:57:33,443 --> 00:57:33,665
Rym: Yep.

1045
00:57:33,847 --> 00:57:35,683
Rym: And, two, I'm spreading the word.

1046
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:35,764
Rym: Yep.

1047
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:40,758
Scott: What we can do is, plus, if you run, like, a board game-- It's the same thing that happens with conventions.

1048
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:44,250
Rym: We don't really go to anime cons unless we're, you know, talent at them.

1049
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:47,646
Rym: We don't go to-- PAX is the only con I'd go to if I wasn't, like, a guest.

1050
00:57:47,707 --> 00:57:47,870
Scott: Yeah.

1051
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:55,745
Scott: But, I mean, you know, if you're not running-- if you don't run an RPG, if you run a board game, you can just get it started, and then we can start a game at a different table.

1052
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:56,190
Scott: Yeah.

1053
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:57,399
Scott: Of just us.

1054
00:57:57,602 --> 00:58:04,774
Scott: Like, if four of us all run board games, we can all start up those games and then go to our own table and play.

1055
00:58:04,794 --> 00:58:06,290
Scott: This is also why-- Serious gamer, he says.

1056
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:15,869
Rym: something I want to do at PAX East, and we have vague ideas, and we can't say if anything will happen or not, but what if we had a room, like, a panel room that was dedicated to this?

1057
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:19,221
Rym: Where you would run, like, learn to play sessions, like, a lecture, a panel.

1058
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:20,433
Rym: that's, like, 45 minutes long.

1059
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:22,434
Rym: Everyone will learn how to play Puerto Rico right now.

1060
00:58:22,474 --> 00:58:23,120
Rym: We'll teach you all.

1061
00:58:23,221 --> 00:58:29,281
Scott: Yeah, I mean, at PAX West once, I taught, like, a whole room, like, three groups, like, 15 people how to play Agricola simultaneously.

1062
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:30,492
Rym: So what if we institutionalize that?

1063
00:58:30,512 --> 00:58:38,717
Rym: We have a panel room where it's just-- it's got tables in it, even, and you-- for 45 minutes, you teach Puerto Rico, and then, look, there's 10 sets of Puerto Rico.

1064
00:58:38,979 --> 00:58:40,777
Scott: And there's a room full of people who know how to play it.

1065
00:58:40,959 --> 00:58:42,230
Rym: Oh, everybody play Puerto Rico.

1066
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:45,789
Rym: And, oh, the moderator who ran the panel is there to help with rules questions.

1067
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:46,416
Scott: Yeah.

1068
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:46,965
Scott: Huh.

1069
00:58:47,087 --> 00:58:47,290
Scott: Huh.

1070
00:58:47,731 --> 00:58:51,101
Rym: Because I really-- it's not-- you know, we're not special.

1071
00:58:51,162 --> 00:58:52,496
Rym: We're not that smart.

1072
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:54,637
Rym: We just played a lot of goddamn games.

1073
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,869
Rym: I mean, it's like the Street Fighter guy.

1074
00:58:56,251 --> 00:58:56,919
Rym: He's great.

1075
00:58:56,979 --> 00:58:57,870
Rym: It's an important skill.

1076
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,396
Rym: Well, not an important skill, but it's a skill that he earned.

1077
00:59:00,456 --> 00:59:01,289
Rym: He'd be fought for.

1078
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:03,404
Rym: But it doesn't take that much.

1079
00:59:03,747 --> 00:59:06,778
Rym: Very little practice at Street Fighter makes you way better than your friends.

1080
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,809
Scott: Right, but it takes a whole lot of practice to become the best.

1081
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:10,714
Rym: Yep.

1082
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:11,410
Rym: Around.

1083
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:12,135
Rym: No one's gonna--.

1084
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:27,350
Rym: So, I feel like our real strategy as we get older is we have to kind of make the culture that will make people become obsessed nerds like us about games so that we then have people to play with.

1085
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,779
Scott: I think, also, you have to sort of pick and choose in your own life.

1086
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:34,457
Scott: You know, choose only a few things to build your skills in, right?

1087
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:40,159
Scott: Don't do Starcraft and Street Fighter and board games and-- Why not?

1088
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:41,210
Rym: You'll just be better than everyone.

1089
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,945
Scott: Right, but you gotta, you know, in some aspect, you have to, you know--.

1090
00:59:45,551 --> 00:59:47,630
Rym: Wait, are you saying I should strive for mediocrity?

1091
00:59:48,132 --> 00:59:49,630
Scott: No, I'm not saying strive for mediocrity.

1092
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:51,916
Scott: I'm saying, you know, you should think about it.

1093
00:59:51,956 --> 00:59:57,630
Scott: If you try to practice all those things at once, you're never gonna be the huge master of any of them.

1094
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,269
Scott: You'll become really good at a whole bunch of them.

1095
00:59:59,652 --> 01:00:01,029
Scott: You won't be god of any of them.

1096
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:03,210
Rym: You could become a master, but not a professional.

1097
01:00:03,271 --> 01:00:09,290
Scott: Right, so pick something, one or two things to be god, like, as good, like, world class at.

1098
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,624
Rym: Well, like you did with Pac-Man.

1099
01:00:10,684 --> 01:00:11,614
Rym: You were like, "I'm gonna be the best at

1100
01:00:11,654 --> 01:00:11,816
Rym: this.".

1101
01:00:11,957 --> 01:00:12,806
Scott: Yup, exactly.

1102
01:00:12,866 --> 01:00:21,190
Scott: And then, you know, pick a whole bunch of things to be as good as you can at, but then, you know, accept that you can't, you know, you really can't do everything in the world.

1103
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,369
Rym: And when you can't find-- Like, you know what?

1104
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:25,089
Rym: Street Fighter, I suck.

1105
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:28,910
Rym: Like, I even try, and I'm just so bad, like, it's a joke.

1106
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,218
Scott: Yeah, you also shmups.

1107
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:31,769
Rym: Yeah, I'm terrible at shmups, too.

1108
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:49,790
Scott: If you can't find anybody, then go and do some of those things that you enjoy that you haven't, you know, the things that you're good at, so you're really good at tennis, you can't find anyone to play tennis with, well, there's something else you enjoy that you probably haven't practiced as much, so go back and play that for a while, you know?

1109
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:56,433
Scott: And then, maybe your tennis skills will rust, and you'll go back to it, but there's still gonna be that thing that you mastered, maybe golf, right?

1110
01:00:56,796 --> 01:00:58,170
Scott: And then, don't give up on that.

1111
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:02,470
Scott: Keep practicing the golf, even if it's alone in the driving range, so you can be the master of something.

1112
01:01:35,171 --> 01:01:36,730
Scott: No studio, and no audience.

1113
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:39,850
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
