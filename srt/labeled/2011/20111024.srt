1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,636
Rym: It's Monday, October 24th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,819
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:13,641
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:15,405
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:17,310
Rym: Tonight we talk about to the Amazons.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,744
Rym: From the servering perspective.

7
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:21,590
Scott: Web services.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,588
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,293
Rym: Independent of the show we're doing right now, we had Luke Crane come into the studio.

10
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:35,020
Rym: We're gonna have him, you know, we recorded something fun.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,449
Rym: We're gonna put up as soon as we get a chance.

12
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:40,420
Rym: But, uh, couldn't find the extra microphone.

13
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,127
Scott: Oh, where I couldn't you find it?

14
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:44,312
Rym: You couldn't find it either.

15
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:46,360
Scott: Actually, I could and did.

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,506
Rym: Actually, didn't Emily find it?

17
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:49,170
Scott: No.

18
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,700
Rym: She also failed in the same spot.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,002
Scott: I found it.

20
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:52,864
Rym: In the end.

21
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:57,296
Scott: Yes, and you, A, failed at cleaning and B, failed at looking.

22
00:00:57,336 --> 00:00:59,424
Rym: No, it had fallen off of something.

23
00:00:59,626 --> 00:00:59,848
Scott: Sure.

24
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:00,940
Scott: No, it was in the corner.

25
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,404
Rym: Yeah, it had fallen from above.

26
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:03,850
Scott: It was in the corner of the closet.

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,364
Rym: I would not have put it in the bottom corner of the closet on my own.

28
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:09,371
Scott: Right, because you didn't put it anywhere.

29
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:09,792
Scott: No.

30
00:01:09,873 --> 00:01:10,756
Scott: That was your problem.

31
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:11,980
Rym: If I didn't put it anywhere.

32
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,720
Scott: Just like you let the 52 DC Comics get all over the place instead of keeping them in one pile.

33
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,894
Rym: They were organized as far as I cared.

34
00:01:19,177 --> 00:01:19,580
Scott: Yeah.

35
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,143
Rym: They were fine.

36
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:23,173
Scott: So he needed to do an episode and we couldn't fucking find them.

37
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:24,560
Rym: I didn't need them.

38
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,240
Rym: I'd do what was in all of them.

39
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:28,128
Scott: I didn't remember because I'd read them before you.

40
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:30,057
Rym: Now, had you said that that was a prerequisite?

41
00:01:30,077 --> 00:01:32,869
Rym: You said, "Hey, Rym, I need all those comics available or I can't do the

42
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:33,190
Rym: show.".

43
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:35,200
Scott: I could do the show, just not as well.

44
00:01:35,622 --> 00:01:37,694
Rym: I just assumed that you had notes on them and remembered.

45
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:38,680
Scott: I did have notes on them.

46
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,523
Scott: I do have notes on them.

47
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:41,773
Rym: You didn't seem to remember much of what happened in most of those comics.

48
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:43,099
Scott: Only the three or four that you didn't have.

49
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:46,900
Scott: They weren't memorable.

50
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:49,445
Rym: Some of them were quite memorable.

51
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:49,866
Rym: Legion Lost.

52
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:51,411
Scott: You didn't catch my funny.

53
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:53,297
Scott: I remember Legion Lost as well.

54
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:54,180
Rym: I remember it.

55
00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:57,520
Rym: I remember the slaughter of children.

56
00:01:58,004 --> 00:01:58,300
Scott: Shit.

57
00:01:59,664 --> 00:01:59,792
Scott: Okay.

58
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,627
Scott: So yeah, technologies.

59
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:05,480
Scott: We actually came up with three technology show ideas.

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,748
Scott: We should get us through a month and a half.

61
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:07,111
Scott: Yep.

62
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:08,098
Scott: All right.

63
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:08,318
Scott: Yes.

64
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:15,119
Rym: But before we get to that, I want to talk a little bit about this story about Anonymous taking down some child porn websites.

65
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:15,560
Scott: Nice.

66
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,238
Scott: Because stuff like this... That's the kind of stuff I was telling them to do.

67
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,231
Scott: In fact, let me go pull up the blog post where I listed the things they should do.

68
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:22,693
Scott: they're not doing.

69
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:25,205
Rym: Well, you see stuff like this occasionally.

70
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,089
Rym: Usually the debate.

71
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:33,814
Rym: People will talk about black hat versus white hat and someone always brings up the the notion of why don't we hack for good?

72
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:35,880
Rym: Like why don't we hack the bad guys?

73
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,004
Scott: I wrote a whole blog post about it.

74
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,328
Rym: Go take down the botnet.

75
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:41,317
Rym: Make a worm that installs antivirus.

76
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:42,100
Rym: You know, stuff like that.

77
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:47,740
Rym: It's pretty rare to see anyone actually try to do that sort of white hat.

78
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,440
Rym: vigilanteism on the Internet.

79
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,082
Scott: Yep.

80
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:59,817
Scott: And I feel like this is an interesting trend because on one hand sometimes what people have done is they've used the Internet to harass someone who is guilty of a real-world crime.

81
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,569
Scott: Like remember the lady who put the cat in the trash?

82
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:01,851
Scott: Yep.

83
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:07,674
Rym: But at the same time you have to be wary if someone wasn't convicted of a crime in a court of law.

84
00:03:08,316 --> 00:03:10,544
Rym: Is it really fair to vigilante them?

85
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:12,652
Rym: I mean, do you really know if they did it?

86
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:15,668
Scott: If you saw a video of them do it and you know, you got the right person.

87
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,179
Scott: I mean, you know, they're gonna be guilty.

88
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,053
Rym: and there was recently a story about a waitress who posted on Reddit or somewhere about...

89
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:28,029
Scott: This isn't like, you know, a death row case where someone didn't have the DNA evidence.

90
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:32,700
Scott: This is, we have a video, we have a clear video of a person doing something.

91
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:34,599
Scott: You know, it's like, okay.

92
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:45,990
Rym: I'm just saying there was recently a story where a waitress basically called out a guy for not leaving a tit and the Internet found the guy and harassed him and it turned out that wasn't actually the right guy.

93
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:48,118
Scott: Yeah, you got to make sure you got the right guy.

94
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:48,500
Scott: Yeah.

95
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,504
Rym: So I didn't really read the deep details of the story but it appears...

96
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:56,720
Scott: And not leaving a tip is not worthy of Internet harassment.

97
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,660
Scott: Putting a cat in a trash bin is a little more worthy because cats power the Internet.

98
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,422
Rym: Well, the Internet...

99
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:03,669
Scott: You're damaging the Internet by throwing out a cat.

100
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:07,200
Rym: The Internet is really a revival of ancient Egypt coupled with pornography.

101
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,567
Rym: I mean, what does the Internet worship?

102
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:13,267
Rym: The two most important things on the Internet are cats and pornography.

103
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:14,150
Scott: Dead people.

104
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,912
Rym: Dead people.

105
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:17,560
Rym: No, I think pornography and cats are higher than dead people.

106
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,089
Scott: Dead people are up there.

107
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:20,178
Rym: They're not that up there.

108
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,391
Rym: Live celebrity people are up there more than dead people.

109
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:25,093
Scott: I think they're equal.

110
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:28,644
Scott: In fact, dead people sort of get this special power boost when they die.

111
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:30,129
Rym: Only for a short time.

112
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,600
Scott: Anyway, because their souls go into the Internet and boost their Internet.

113
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,245
Scott: Anyway, so here's my list.

114
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:42,811
Scott: Actually, I wrote a blog post on my personal blog as a list of 10 things hackers should do that would be so awesome, yet incredibly illegal.

115
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:45,800
Rym: Is one of those make a virus that wipes out computers?

116
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,845
Scott: No, maybe.

117
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:47,208
Scott: I don't know.

118
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:47,711
Scott: I'd forget.

119
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:48,356
Scott: Let's see.

120
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:58,490
Scott: Number one, instead of hacking, say, Sony to turn off the PlayStation Network, hack iTunes or Steam to give everyone all the music, all the movies, all the games.

121
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,660
Scott: Just imagine if everyone's Steam account suddenly had every game.

122
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,015
Scott: Or if everyone's iTunes account suddenly had every music and every video and every app.

123
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:06,260
Scott: That would be the shit.

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,872
Rym: Also, wouldn't that get unhacked right away?

125
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,360
Scott: Probably, but it'd be kind of awesome.

126
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,572
Scott: And you could download shit before the hack was, you know, turned off.

127
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:15,560
Scott: Plus, depends how good the hack is, right?

128
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,477
Scott: It could theoretically be so good that they would have to turn the service off or something, right?

129
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,644
Scott: Anyway, it would still be awesome.

130
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:25,298
Scott: Also, you could remove region locking on Hulu or Spotify or something like that.

131
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:25,860
Scott: That would be cool.

132
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:30,532
Scott: You could go and steal the source code to important things.

133
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:32,559
Scott: Remember they stole the source code of like Half-Life 2?

134
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:32,920
Scott: Remember that?

135
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:34,465
Rym: Oh, yeah.

136
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:36,091
Rym: Imagine if you- Nothing ever came of that, though.

137
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:41,415
Scott: Imagine if someone stole the source code to say Photoshop or something fucking useful, right?

138
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,260
Scott: That would be awesome.

139
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,152
Scott: iOS, another great thing to steal the source code for.

140
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:46,620
Scott: Windows, also a good idea.

141
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:54,439
Scott: Someone could hack into an ISP to remove bullshit such as filtering, bandwidth limiting, wiretapping, you know, etc.

142
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,636
Scott: Hack into the great firewall of China and just turn it off, you know?

143
00:05:58,796 --> 00:05:59,600
Scott: Those are great ideas.

144
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,040
Rym: Thing is, some of those things are probably not feasible for- Oh, yeah, they're incredibly difficult.

145
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:08,996
Rym: Because the people who are doing these internet hacks are not- I didn't say they were easy.

146
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,160
Scott: I said they were good ideas.

147
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:13,807
Scott: It's not 100% infeasible.

148
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:15,273
Rym: I- I don't know.

149
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:17,060
Rym: On one hand, this is Batman.

150
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:21,200
Rym: The debate comes down to whether or not Batman is okay.

151
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:24,795
Rym: And I'm really ambivalent.

152
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:31,420
Rym: On one hand, taking down a bunch of child porn websites, and it looks like they were pretty legitimately child porn websites.

153
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,080
Scott: Well, I mean, if you go into IRC, just open up MIRC, download it for free, which is illegal, right?

154
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,320
Scott: And just look at the list of IRC servers, pick one, and then list the channels in the IRC server.

155
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:43,526
Scott: You're gonna see child porn channels.

156
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:47,780
Scott: I don't know how come the government can't just go and arrest everyone in those channels.

157
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,784
Scott: Is it really that hard?

158
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:50,331
Rym: I mean, obviously- It's hard to track them down.

159
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:52,320
Scott: Obviously the people in foreign countries, right?

160
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,719
Scott: But I mean, you can just go and- there's people there, child porn's right there, you can- it's not hiding that well.

161
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,760
Rym: Now maybe, Scott, there's a chance that every one of those channels is nothing but cops.

162
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,260
Scott: It is possible that every one of those channels is nothing but cops.

163
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,923
Rym: So here's the story.

164
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:08,680
Rym: I'm just gonna quote the quote from Slashdot quoted.

165
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,580
Rym: This guy named Lolita City.

166
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,800
Scott: They actually just had a straight up website named Lolita City, and they got him over there.

167
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,876
Rym: Yeah, I imagine you had to have an account to log in.

168
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,760
Rym: I was going to the pace bin, and it was kind of funny, because it was- pace bin's always a weird place to go around.

169
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:53,540
Rym: But it was half, like, reports of how they got them and who they got, and also half, like, the people from this Lolita website getting mad or talking to them in chat rooms or freaking out or worrying that their contact info would get out.

170
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,579
Rym: And also a lot of Occupy Wall Street crap just kind of mixed in.

171
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:04,780
Scott: Yeah, you know, I read an article about pace bin once that talked about how a lot of the pace bin stuff is actually just, like, passwords.

172
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,960
Scott: Like, lists of passwords and logins for, like, legitimate porn sites, you know, that charge money so you can go look at the porn for free.

173
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:17,460
Scott: And I think, really, this is what's happened to pace bin, because most of the coders have moved to GitHub and they use Gist now.

174
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,440
Scott: And pace bin's original purpose of posting code has sort of gone away.

175
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:31,580
Scott: But people who just want to anonymously put a piece of text that's not associated to anything on the internet and link to it, right, have been using it for this purpose.

176
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:33,379
Scott: Usually nefarious people, I don't know.

177
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:34,443
Scott: It's kind of weird.

178
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:38,440
Scott: I wish I figured out- I wish I could figure out exactly how that evolved in that direction.

179
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,580
Rym: So, Scott, is it okay to Batman child pornography peddlers?

180
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,679
Rym: Is this okay?

181
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,280
Scott: You're not- see, this is the thing, right?

182
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,840
Rym: I'm asking you, because you always want to bring the debate, forget law, forget whatever, morally, is this okay?

183
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,020
Scott: This particular activity is absolutely okay and I'm gonna tell you why.

184
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:57,316
Rym: Alright.

185
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:08,160
Scott: Because unlike, say, the cat thing or anything like that, right, it's like they're not actually going to hurt these people, you know, they're not going to pass judgement on these pedophiles.

186
00:09:09,285 --> 00:09:13,320
Scott: They're not going to the pedophile's houses and beating them up or- Not yet, that might happen.

187
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,966
Scott: Calling them on the phone harassing them, right?

188
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:18,340
Scott: All they're doing is taking down the child porn sites.

189
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:25,200
Rym: That would be like- And publishing personal details to the people who are on the sites, thus probably leading to harassment and retaliation.

190
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,120
Scott: Yes, but they're not actually doing the harassment or the retaliation themselves.

191
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,620
Rym: So it's okay to give someone the tools to harass and the motivation, but not to actually do it yourself.

192
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:38,900
Scott: Is it okay to give you a BitTorrent client, a torrent file, a computer, and an internet connection?

193
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,534
Rym: So some would argue no.

194
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:43,879
Scott: Is it okay for me to sell you a gun?

195
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:47,140
Rym: We're in New York, so it's actually really hard.

196
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,395
Scott: I'm just saying, you know, but is it okay for me to give you a CD burner?

197
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:52,600
Scott: You might burn some CDs.

198
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,100
Rym: But it's different if you give someone a CD burner and the instructions and a link to the media.

199
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,117
Scott: Fine, I'll give you, "Is it okay for me to put bomb making instructions on the

200
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:00,459
Scott: internet?".

201
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:00,812
Rym: No.

202
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:01,836
Rym: No?

203
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:02,792
Rym: No, I just said,

204
00:10:02,954 --> 00:10:03,056
Rym: "Uh."

205
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:08,640
Rym: Because when I first got access to the internet when I was a kid- The first thing you looked for was bomb making instructions.

206
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,200
Rym: My family's sitting around the computer, like everyone, and the neighbor, like some friends of the family.

207
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,940
Rym: We're all sitting around the computer, everyone's so excited.

208
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,337
Rym: And I go on the internet and I search for, quote, "bomb making

209
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:22,300
Rym: instructions."

210
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:23,580
Rym: Not how to make a bomb?

211
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,320
Rym: I search for bomb making instructions.

212
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:25,919
Scott: There you go.

213
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,000
Rym: The next thing I searched for was the anarchist cookbook, and then I started searching for games.

214
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:33,119
Scott: Yep, games it was.

215
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,280
Scott: You didn't let me finish my list of things, but I'll move on anyway.

216
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,660
Rym: You can continue your list if you really want.

217
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,999
Scott: Okay, sure, I'll do it real quick.

218
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:47,119
Scott: Hack into this, some guy sort of did this, hack into all the academic journal systems and take all the academic articles from all the journals and put them up somewhere for free.

219
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,427
Scott: Hack into J.P.

220
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:51,860
Scott: Morgan, Goldman Sachs, et cetera, and just bring them down.

221
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,920
Scott: That'll do a lot more than occupying their sidewalk.

222
00:10:56,441 --> 00:11:06,859
Scott: Hack into government and corporate back office systems, not to take them down, but they find evidence on the exchange servers of corruption and people doing evil, exposing them, and then they go to jail because someone else...

223
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,420
Rym: You saw that article, I'm assuming.

224
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:17,200
Rym: There is a piece of software that the financial world, like the executives of companies, use to communicate securely, and it got malwared.

225
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:17,759
Scott: Nice.

226
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,680
Rym: And hackers might have gotten access to pretty much all the internal...

227
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:32,680
Scott: Now they gotta find the evidence of some big CEO who's got too much money actually doing something criminal, exposing him, and then he can end up with the Enron guys, one of the few CEOs to actually end up in jail.

228
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,326
Scott: Because you know what?

229
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:42,078
Scott: Almost, I guarantee, if we could actually read all those emails, you'd know that like 90% of those guys have done something worthy of going to jail, right?

230
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,660
Scott: So the fact that they're not in jail is whatever.

231
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:47,539
Scott: Bring down the firewall at China, I already said that one.

232
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,379
Scott: Attack the TV satellites and turn them all off.

233
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,299
Rym: I don't think that's as relevant as it used to be.

234
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,279
Scott: No, but it would still be awesome, especially... I wrote in this blog post, quote...

235
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:58,320
Rym: During the Super Bowl.

236
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,800
Scott: No, quote me, at the very least replace Fox News with Al Jazeera English.

237
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:09,640
Scott: Also, the best one at least, right, disable all the nuclear missiles.

238
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:18,480
Scott: I know they're not connected to the internet, but I'm just saying, if you could just disable all the nuclear launch systems on the planet, like at once, sort of like in, what was that comic?

239
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,200
Scott: Rising Stars, I think is what it was called?

240
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,318
Scott: Have you read that?

241
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:23,977
Scott: Oh, I should give that to you.

242
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,234
Rym: Who wrote it?

243
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:31,550
Scott: I think it's the same guy who wrote the real Ghostbusters cartoon, if I remember correctly.

244
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:32,679
Scott: JMS, let me look it up.

245
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:32,969
Rym: Really?

246
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,019
Scott: Yeah, let me look this up real quick.

247
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:41,900
Scott: Yes, it was indeed J. Michael Straczynski who wrote Rising Stars and he also wrote the real Ghostbusters cartoon series.

248
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:43,678
Scott: It's pretty good.

249
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:44,828
Scott: You would like it.

250
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:46,160
Scott: Scott Johnson would really like it.

251
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,180
Scott: I think he might have read it already.

252
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,159
Rym: He probably did.

253
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:48,780
Scott: Probably.

254
00:12:49,860 --> 00:13:00,380
Scott: Alright, so news, right, if you didn't know, the Nexus Prime, which is now named the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, so it's like the Galaxy 2 is real popular and the Nexus Prime was real popular.

255
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,478
Rym: But I have the Nexus S.

256
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:10,360
Scott: Well, now they've got the Samsung Galaxy Nexus is coming out, it's going to be the only phone, or at least the first phone, to have the new version of Android Ice Cream Sandwich.

257
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,499
Rym: Conrad really wants to come on GeekNights and talk about that.

258
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:18,220
Scott: So, here's the thing, right, it's like they had Gingerbread, which I imagine you have, right?

259
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:18,677
Rym: I have that.

260
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:21,900
Scott: The tablets, the Android tablets, have Honeycomb.

261
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,039
Scott: Honeycomb was not on phones.

262
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,379
Scott: Ice Cream Sandwich is supposedly going to be on tablets and phones, the same Android.

263
00:13:30,382 --> 00:13:32,860
Scott: In other news, this phone actually looks like a nice phone.

264
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,559
Scott: The only problem I have with it, which I don't think is a problem that you'll have with it, is that it's kind of big.

265
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:41,640
Scott: I don't like big phones.

266
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:42,855
Scott: It's about as big as your Nexus S.

267
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,980
Rym: My Nexus S is not big, it's smaller than an iPhone.

268
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,200
Scott: No, no it's not.

269
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,920
Rym: The old iPhone.

270
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:57,620
Scott: Maybe the original iPhone, but actually, I realized, we were comparing the iPhone to Android sizes, and it's like, yeah, the other phones are way too big.

271
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,539
Rym: The thing is, this phone is pretty much all screen, and it's actually really thin.

272
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:05,180
Scott: The thinness is there all the time, right?

273
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,960
Scott: I'm talking about the width and the height, right?

274
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:13,009
Scott: The iPhone is three and a half inch, which is like the perfect size, but these phones are like 4.65 inch.

275
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,420
Scott: It's a whole extra inch diagonally over the iPhone.

276
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,020
Scott: That's a lot, right?

277
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,480
Scott: You know, it makes a big difference in ways that you might not realize.

278
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,756
Scott: Someone posted an article, and they were like, "Why is the iPhone the size it

279
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:26,938
Scott: is?".

280
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:37,060
Scott: And the reason is, because Apple figured it out, the average length of someone's thumb is so you can hit the other side of it with your thumb if you're only holding it on one side.

281
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,660
Rym: Yeah, you know what, I have plenty of extra thumb space here.

282
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,177
Scott: Oh, yours actually looks smaller than the Nexus S.

283
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:43,415
Rym: It probably is.

284
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:45,180
Scott: It might be, but yeah.

285
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,279
Rym: Because I looked at it before.

286
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:47,811
Scott: We should measure your inches.

287
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,058
Rym: And I was looking at the HTCs, and they were just so big, I was like, "Fuck

288
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:53,300
Rym: this.".

289
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,500
Scott: Yeah, this Galaxy Nexus looks pretty big, but it's running the next Android, which is supposed to be better.

290
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:04,535
Scott: But you know what, I went and I downloaded the Android dev kit on my new work computer, which is an i7.

291
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,579
Scott: And everybody knows that the Android dev kit is slow because it's running in an ARM emulator, as opposed to running, you know.

292
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:15,940
Scott: So, that's to be expected.

293
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,846
Scott: It's slow.

294
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,680
Scott: I didn't care about the slowness, I knew there was a reason for it, whatever.

295
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:27,078
Scott: I actually tried to use it, though, and even if I pretended it was really fast, I was just really bad.

296
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:30,895
Scott: I couldn't figure out what the fuck was going on, or how to use it.

297
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,400
Rym: Did you read the documentation?

298
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:35,580
Scott: Yeah, you don't need to read the documentation to use an iPhone, that's all I'm saying.

299
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:42,454
Scott: People always talk, and they sort of take for granted, "Oh, Apple's GUIs are so great, and everyone else's interfaces are so

300
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:42,837
Scott: bad.".

301
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:46,880
Scott: And, you know, I actually disagree when it comes to OS X, that Apple is so great.

302
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,600
Scott: You know, people disagree with me, but whatever.

303
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,160
Scott: I actually like Windows better than OS X and such.

304
00:15:52,301 --> 00:16:01,860
Scott: But, when it comes to the iPhone and the iPad, you know, the interface improvements matter so much more when the device is smaller.

305
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:03,136
Scott: Just same thing with the iPod.

306
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:10,218
Scott: It's like, I'll pay more for an iPod over a Zune because the interface design matters more when the device is less.

307
00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:14,619
Scott: So, I think I'm probably looking at iPhone 5 here for now.

308
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,828
Rym: The thing is, I literally have no problems with my Nexus, which, Scott, by the way, is 2.48 inches wide.

309
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:20,639
Scott: Oh, wow.

310
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:21,831
Rym: And 4.88 inches high.

311
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,940
Scott: Oh, what about, what's the diagonal?

312
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:25,100
Rym: I have no idea.

313
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:26,640
Scott: The diagonal's the number we're talking about.

314
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,700
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what the number is.

315
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:33,645
Scott: See, iPhone has a 3.5 inch diagonal, and the Nexus, well, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus has a 4.65 inch diagonal.

316
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,440
Rym: See, the thing is, mine is narrow.

317
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:41,038
Rym: It's narrow, but it's slightly taller to make up for it.

318
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:42,239
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

319
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,060
Scott: We're gonna have to, we're gonna do some size comparisons.

320
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,300
Rym: I can trivially thumb the entire thing.

321
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:47,560
Scott: All right, well, you know.

322
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:52,695
Rym: And it's pretty much the perfect size to fit in my pocket, so you're not gonna sell me on size unless--.

323
00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:00,340
Scott: Well, at least on your particular phone, but there are a lot of these other Android phones-- Like I said, the other Androids I looked at before I got the Nexus S-- Like the EVO 4G is enormous.

324
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,737
Rym: Oh, my God, the Hero was enormous.

325
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:03,259
Scott: They're so big.

326
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:04,617
Scott: I think this is one of the big ones.

327
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,359
Scott: these phones so big.

328
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,720
Rym: I'm waiting to see if I'll be able to upgrade to the ice cream sandwich on this phone.

329
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,239
Scott: I think you, from what I heard, you will be able to get.

330
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:15,500
Rym: That's what I've heard too, but I haven't seen a confirmation.

331
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,058
Scott: But you don't get it immediately, right?

332
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,380
Scott: That's another thing with the iPhone.

333
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,078
Scott: Everybody just gets updated all immediately at the same time.

334
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,326
Rym: Yeah.

335
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,776
Scott: But, you know, there are plenty of negatives to iPhone.

336
00:17:24,722 --> 00:17:26,420
Scott: Like, they brought out this Wi-Fi sync.

337
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:26,979
Scott: It's bullshit.

338
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:27,618
Scott: It doesn't work.

339
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,137
Scott: Fuck them.

340
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,598
Rym: Are you sure it doesn't work?

341
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,997
Scott: It works, but it doesn't do what you want it to do.

342
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:36,960
Rym: Okay, the Galaxy Nexus is a little bigger.

343
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,522
Rym: It's 2.67 inches wide instead of 2.48.

344
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:42,740
Scott: That's a pretty big difference, actually.

345
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,629
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

346
00:17:52,851 --> 00:17:55,790
Rym: I watched Robocop with Emily last night.

347
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,489
Scott: I watched that a couple months ago.

348
00:17:57,892 --> 00:18:01,269
Rym: I hadn't seen Robocop since I was single digit age.

349
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:12,729
Scott: Robocop 1 is really good, and contrary to what I may have said on another trivia-related podcast with Atomic Wars, Frank Miller actually only wrote Robocop 2 through X.

350
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,990
Rym: Oh, so he wrote all the bad ones.

351
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,551
Scott: He didn't write Robocop 1.

352
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:17,610
Scott: He wrote all the other Robocop.

353
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,530
Rym: Yeah, we'll do a show on it, I think.

354
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,630
Scott: Or at least help write all the other Robocop.

355
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,310
Rym: Because I have plenty to say about Robocop.

356
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,010
Scott: He was not involved in Robocop 1.

357
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,869
Scott: Robocop 1 is great.

358
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,289
Scott: The other ones are less great.

359
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,750
Rym: Robocop 1 stands out well beyond other movies from 1987.

360
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,291
Scott: Yeah, Robocop 1 is almost as good as Terminator 2.

361
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,330
Rym: It is a way good movie.

362
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,032
Scott: Except the claymation, while cool, doesn't hold up 100%.

363
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:39,570
Rym: That wasn't claymation.

364
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,648
Rym: It was stop motion.

365
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:42,830
Rym: But notice the funny homage.

366
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:46,169
Rym: there was the stop motion dinosaur in the SUX ad.

367
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:48,550
Scott: Yeah, but it would have been.

368
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:50,910
Scott: it just doesn't hold up graphically.

369
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,749
Scott: But it was still really good for its time.

370
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:56,930
Rym: So I have for you we're going to do a Robocop show.

371
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:58,549
Rym: so I'm not going to make this a Robocop show.

372
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,009
Rym: We have to do one.

373
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:00,988
Rym: I have a lot to say.

374
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,489
Rym: But I have for you two Robocop-related things of the day.

375
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:07,948
Scott: There's about 10 billion of them.

376
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,789
Scott: Yeah, but these in particular If you search Robocop on YouTube you're going to see infinity awesome things.

377
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,988
Rym: So apparently Robocop saved Sting in a wrestling.

378
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,450
Scott: Not Harvey the musician Sting.

379
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,070
Rym: No, no, no, Sting the wrestler.

380
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,050
Scott: Sting the wrestler, the guy with the face paint.

381
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:25,445
Rym: Yep.

382
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,369
Scott: And the blonde hair.

383
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,510
Rym: So it looks like Robocop.

384
00:19:29,814 --> 00:19:37,866
Rym: I don't know what else I can say other than Robocop rips the front off of that cage and lets Sting out and wrestling is exactly what wrestling is.

385
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,730
Scott: Professional wrestling.

386
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:46,490
Rym: So the other one I want to do you'll find a million things like the Robocop KFC commercial.

387
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:53,128
Rym: there's a ton of Japanese and Korean commercials with Robocop in them for like fried chicken and noodles and whatever.

388
00:19:54,090 --> 00:20:02,890
Rym: My thing of the day is the first episode of the Robocop cartoon because I think many of our listeners are either too old or too young.

389
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:08,321
Rym: you have to be in the sweet spot to have watched the Robocop cartoon on TV.

390
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:10,610
Rym: Like now Robocop is kind of like it had a resurgence.

391
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,942
Scott: It was on for like a minute.

392
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:15,050
Scott: so if you weren't watching it that Saturday morning cartoons on that day.

393
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:18,749
Rym: No, there was a large line of toys related to it.

394
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,670
Scott: There were plenty of Robocop toys.

395
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:28,059
Rym: Robocop was a really huge franchise actually in the 80s and the early 90s and then it faded away.

396
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,050
Rym: I mean there's a reason why there's like three movies the NES game, all these games and everything.

397
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:38,990
Rym: And a lot of people don't really I don't know, like it was forgotten the next generation never even saw Robocop.

398
00:20:40,276 --> 00:20:43,850
Rym: So yeah, go watch Robocop and watch the Robocop cartoon.

399
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:48,116
Scott: It's also funny because they talk about like future Detroit but it's present Detroit.

400
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:53,163
Rym: In the dark future Detroit is a hell hole filled with Fist of the North Star.

401
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:53,809
Rym: bad guys.

402
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,665
Scott: It came true.

403
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:58,042
Scott: Alright so check this out.

404
00:20:58,164 --> 00:20:58,510
Scott: I'm checking.

405
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:04,924
Scott: There's this thing called the Google AI AI Challenge Ants Fall 2011 sponsored by Google.

406
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:10,603
Scott: It used to also be involved with some University of Waterloo or something but they're not involved anymore.

407
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:11,693
Scott: but some of the people are whatever.

408
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:13,550
Scott: The point is it's an AI challenge.

409
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:21,570
Scott: There's this game involving little ants and you have to write a bot that plays this game and you submit your bot and it competes against the other bots.

410
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:32,710
Scott: Even if you don't know how to program this tutorial if you follow the tutorial and submit the tutorial bot you will do well because a lot of people have submitted bots a lot worse than the tutorial bot.

411
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:39,550
Scott: I submitted the tutorial bot and I moved up the rankings very quickly like the top few hundred people.

412
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,460
Rym: So I'm playing around with this too.

413
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:48,769
Rym: It's pretty accessible in terms of learning stuff about coding AI or coding strategy for a game.

414
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:56,098
Rym: I like how you lose if you have to submit your moves in a certain time frame.

415
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:58,225
Rym: If you miss your turn all your ants are just out.

416
00:21:58,246 --> 00:21:58,489
Rym: You're done.

417
00:21:59,071 --> 00:21:59,495
Rym: You're out.

418
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:05,129
Rym: So it prevents the analysis paralysis situation of waiting for someone to take their goddamn turn.

419
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:16,121
Scott: But yeah, so I tried to write a better bot for it and I figured I'll just take the tutorial bot which is already kind of good and what I'll do is I'll change the pathfinding to use A* and I did successfully.

420
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:18,563
Scott: But it finds much better paths.

421
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,018
Scott: The ants don't get lost.

422
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:20,989
Scott: They go straight for the food.

423
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:23,716
Scott: The problem is it's slow.

424
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:28,569
Scott: You have to get your turn you get your orders in on time which is a very short amount of time.

425
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:30,410
Scott: otherwise you just lose.

426
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:38,145
Scott: So yeah I tried I improved the performance a lot but not enough.

427
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:41,176
Scott: So with a little more work though I think I'm gonna maybe...

428
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,570
Rym: I got a really good strategy.

429
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,293
Scott: I know you told me the strategy.

430
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:53,679
Rym: So basically what I'm actually trying to do and it was originally I wanted it to march in formation but that logic's really hard especially when I'm not a coder.

431
00:22:53,699 --> 00:23:01,969
Rym: So instead I'm gonna try to get my ants to form up once I have enough ants and then that will defend itself as long as possible.

432
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:12,669
Rym: I want to form up a gigantic ant penis that then marches around destroying the other ants with its... I guess launching ants out from within itself.

433
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,688
Rym: I just think it would be funny for people who are playing this game to run into my troll AI.

434
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:20,910
Scott: Yeah.

435
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:24,697
Rym: I also don't see... I haven't found anyone trolling this game yet.

436
00:23:25,324 --> 00:23:27,730
Scott: No but I've seen some really clever bots out there.

437
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,525
Scott: I'm just... I'm not gonna try to win because that's well beyond my abilities.

438
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:33,710
Scott: Especially you're not gonna win writing something in Python.

439
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,638
Scott: it's just too slow.

440
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:40,396
Scott: Someone writing in Java or C is gonna just have an advantage straight up and I'm too lazy and I have other things to do.

441
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,790
Scott: But this is kind of fun.

442
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:44,194
Scott: I'm actually... I'm gonna get at least one.

443
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,334
Scott: I just wanna beat the tutorial bot.

444
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:51,530
Scott: If I can make a better bot the tutorial bot that actually works on time and isn't too slow I'll be happy.

445
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:53,709
Scott: but you should definitely get into this.

446
00:23:54,093 --> 00:24:02,849
Scott: this is the... there's been a lot of these before you know like computer program games but this is definitely the most accessible of them that I have seen.

447
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,146
Scott: so if you're gonna try one of them out.

448
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:06,094
Scott: this is the one to go for.

449
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:11,246
Rym: So in the meta moment the book club book previously was the early eye of the arm.

450
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,621
Rym: the one we're doing right now is...

451
00:24:12,641 --> 00:24:14,621
Scott: Double Book Club!

452
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:15,388
Rym: Oh my god.

453
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:22,810
Scott: all the little pranks and also Wind, Sand, and Stars both by Antoine de Saint-Ejupéry ho ho ho.

454
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:29,210
Scott: watch out also conventions.

455
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:38,524
Scott: Burning Apocalypse Con is coming soon on 11-11-11 and we're awesome Are we?

456
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:40,770
Scott: I'm in Japan!

457
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,470
Scott: Yes, also completely unrelated.

458
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:48,559
Scott: I bought you know those little wooden steamy things that you have at the Chinese restaurants to dim some?

459
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:49,874
Rym: Oh you got some!

460
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:50,790
Scott: I bought some!

461
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,441
Rym: What are you gonna steam first?

462
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:54,216
Scott: Dumplings Dumplings?

463
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:55,029
Rym: You're gonna make dumplings?

464
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,276
Scott: I'm gonna go buy little dumpling wrappers and then you scoop some mush into them.

465
00:24:58,317 --> 00:24:59,610
Rym: How much does yours stack up?

466
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,438
Rym: How many components?

467
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,669
Scott: It's only two components but they're actually big.

468
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,690
Rym: You can put dumplings in one and asparagus in the other.

469
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:06,408
Scott: I could.

470
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:11,209
Scott: The trick is because the top one gets less steam than the bottom one.

471
00:25:11,794 --> 00:25:13,709
Scott: you have to put different things in them.

472
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:26,150
Scott: Yeah you put the asparagus up top But there's another all strategy If you want to make just a fuck ton of dumplings put one dumpling in then pick it up and put the other one under it after a little bit and then they'll both be evenly heated.

473
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:27,610
Rym: You're a genius.

474
00:25:27,772 --> 00:25:29,050
Rym: No one ever thought of that before.

475
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:37,009
Scott: Actually the instructions told me that I did Alright, so today's show I'm gonna talk about something that I use a lot at work.

476
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,110
Scott: It's been pretty popular lately.

477
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:41,109
Scott: It's the Amazon Web Services.

478
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:51,827
Rym: My work uses it but I don't do the tech like I used to so I don't interact with it other than getting them for me to use.

479
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:53,009
Scott: So basically here's the deal.

480
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:58,889
Scott: Amazon had a lot of computers that they used for their computing to make Amazon.com go.

481
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:20,177
Scott: but they had problems which was you have to have enough computers so that at the biggest traffic at Black Friday Amazon doesn't go down but say on a Sunday afternoon in January or 2 AM on a Sunday right in January nobody is coming to Amazon and all those servers are sitting there doing nothing.

482
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:22,988
Scott: You're wasting money on them because you still have to pay to keep them on.

483
00:26:23,453 --> 00:26:28,970
Scott: You could basically go turn them off the extra ones but still it costs you money to have this hardware you're not using.

484
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:46,161
Scott: So what Amazon did is they started Amazon Web Services which is hey, you know, let's host, you know, let's make sort of a web host that is dynamic or you can turn servers on and off and use exactly the amount of server that you need with a little bit of overhead so you're not wasting money.

485
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:52,430
Scott: and then all those leftover servers, we can actually sell them as hosting to other people, right?

486
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:54,249
Scott: when we're not using them.

487
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:56,361
Scott: and that's exactly what they did.

488
00:26:56,825 --> 00:27:00,188
Scott: They actually Amazon Web Services started out with the Mechanical Turk.

489
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:02,530
Scott: that was the first Amazon Web Service.

490
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:07,276
Rym: You can read back through Slashdot if you want to learn about kind of the early steps or the history of all this.

491
00:27:07,357 --> 00:27:11,561
Scott: Yeah, so people, you know, they call this like cloud computing but you know what?

492
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:15,197
Scott: It's not fucking, all it is is web hosting.

493
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:20,510
Scott: It's no different than Linode or Dreamhost or any other virtual private server hosting, right?

494
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:30,570
Rym: Well, I think the way to call it cloud is really in the level of automation and services provided, like being able to right click and say new server, new server, make this server.

495
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,248
Scott: Linode does that.

496
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:37,316
Rym: Does it also do Akamai style, you know, hosting out there on demand?

497
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:40,915
Scott: Okay, well see that's the thing that Amazon Web Services has.

498
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:42,390
Scott: It's not just one service, right?

499
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:49,179
Scott: EC2, the Elastic Compute Cloud is give me Linux or Windows computers for hosting.

500
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:50,268
Scott: That's all it is, right?

501
00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:54,010
Scott: I mean it has a little bit of fanciness like in the ways that you can pay for the servers.

502
00:27:54,631 --> 00:28:01,357
Scott: You can bid for spot instances and they might be just taken away from you at any time or given back to you at any time.

503
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:08,832
Scott: So you have to, you can only do work on them such as like encoding video where you can do the work piecemeal and stop and start at any time.

504
00:28:08,852 --> 00:28:14,267
Rym: Which is a very elegant way to make sure that the servers are utilized at the best possible price Amazon could get at any given time.

505
00:28:14,348 --> 00:28:19,420
Scott: You know or you can just say give me a fucking computer and they give you them and that's, you know, there's different sizes and that's it, right?

506
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,136
Scott: That's the Elastic Compute Cloud.

507
00:28:21,156 --> 00:28:22,186
Scott: So that's basic hosting.

508
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:34,130
Scott: But what Amazon Web Services really has going for it is that unlike a typical virtual private server hosting company, they have all these other things that they can give you, right?

509
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:38,958
Scott: Some of them are just specialized cases of EC2.

510
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,937
Scott: For example, RDS.

511
00:28:41,342 --> 00:28:41,970
Scott: What's RDS?

512
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,261
Scott: It's give me a computer that only has a database on it.

513
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,149
Scott: That's all it is.

514
00:28:46,511 --> 00:28:52,634
Scott: There's a couple features in there like you know, easy automatic database backups and rollbacks and those sorts of things.

515
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:53,867
Scott: You know, but it's all.

516
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:55,442
Scott: it is just an interface.

517
00:28:55,563 --> 00:28:56,270
Scott: It's no different.

518
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:02,189
Scott: It doesn't really cost much different if you just got a regular machine with EC2 and installed MySQL on it.

519
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,796
Scott: But, you know, they'll just do RDS.

520
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:09,849
Scott: It's a little bit more managed for you if you just need a database server and you don't need anything else on there, you know.

521
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:16,390
Scott: They also offer Oracle and like you can pay as you go on the Oracle license in case, or you can bring your own Oracle license.

522
00:29:16,753 --> 00:29:17,845
Scott: They got stuff going on like that.

523
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:18,694
Rym: Oh Oracle.

524
00:29:18,714 --> 00:29:21,829
Scott: Alright, you know, Elastic Cache, same kind of thing.

525
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,617
Scott: They just give you a computer with memcached and that's it.

526
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,567
Scott: You know, instead of you buying a machine installing memcached on it they just give you a memcache machine.

527
00:29:29,587 --> 00:29:30,629
Scott: It's like alright, sure.

528
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:35,869
Scott: But the real fanciness comes in with all these other services that they have.

529
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:36,431
Scott: Right?

530
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:41,040
Scott: And the one that I want to talk about the most is the one that's most useful to normal people.

531
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,150
Scott: that people seem to ignore.

532
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:45,807
Scott: And you're probably using it without realizing it, is Amazon S3.

533
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,323
Rym: I mean, I have my own account.

534
00:29:47,343 --> 00:29:48,335
Rym: I back stuff up to it.

535
00:29:48,557 --> 00:29:50,618
Scott: Yeah, it's Amazon Simple Storage Service.

536
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:56,457
Scott: Now, what the Simple Storage Service is, and this is what people sort of sometimes get it wrong, is they think of it as a hard drive.

537
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:56,881
Scott: Right?

538
00:29:56,982 --> 00:29:57,810
Scott: They think of it as storage.

539
00:29:58,034 --> 00:30:01,386
Scott: And it is storage, but it's not a hard drive.

540
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:05,305
Scott: It doesn't have a file system like your computer has a file system.

541
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:07,907
Scott: Even though it looks like it to an amateur, it doesn't.

542
00:30:08,635 --> 00:30:11,992
Scott: And it also doesn't have any CPU resources at all.

543
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:14,677
Scott: So it can't do any processing whatsoever.

544
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:20,924
Scott: Actually, just recently they added the first processing feature to it, which is server-side encryption.

545
00:30:21,227 --> 00:30:22,237
Scott: They haven't had that before.

546
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:22,641
Rym: Oh, yeah.

547
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:23,449
Rym: I got an email about that.

548
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,005
Scott: Yeah, they just added that.

549
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:27,150
Rym: Nothing really needs to be encrypted.

550
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:32,883
Scott: Also, server-side encryption is pointless because now it's not encrypted on the way to the server anyway.

551
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:33,470
Scott: Well, it depends.

552
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,468
Rym: I mean, how do you upload it?

553
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,055
Scott: You have to upload it with some SSL or whatever, but yeah.

554
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:42,865
Scott: So what Simple Storage Service is really is a key value store.

555
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:43,430
Scott: Right?

556
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:54,136
Scott: When you go to S3 and you see something like, you know, photos/rims-photos/Rym.Rym-is-zardoz.jpg Right?

557
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,752
Scott: Actually, that whole big path is just a key.

558
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,624
Scott: And it just happens that in the interface they split it up on the slashes to make it look like folders.

559
00:31:02,665 --> 00:31:11,024
Scott: But really, it's just one long, dumb list of keys, which are big, full file paths, and then the value is the data in the file.

560
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:11,751
Scott: And that's it.

561
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:13,832
Scott: That's all S3 can do.

562
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:23,789
Scott: But you can, as a user, just pretend that doesn't mean anything to you, and just upload all your files there, and they'll be super safe.

563
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,332
Rym: Yep.

564
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:30,601
Rym: Now, I mean, that's all I really use it for right now, is backing things up, because it's relatively cheap for what I'm backing up.

565
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:30,742
Rym: Right.

566
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:33,345
Scott: And the thing is, a lot of people say, "Oh, I'll just use Dropbox.

567
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:33,486
Scott: It's

568
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:33,869
Scott: easier.".

569
00:31:34,112 --> 00:31:35,284
Scott: "Oh, I'll just use, you know,

570
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:35,689
Scott: Libsyn.".

571
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:37,811
Scott: You know, there's all these things that people use.

572
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:40,762
Rym: Well, we use Libsyn for GeekNights, but that's just because it's way cheaper.

573
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:46,982
Scott: But there's these things people use to store files where, really, all those things are using S3.

574
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:53,186
Scott: You can just go right around the middleman and use S3, but in Libsyn's case, the middleman's actually cheaper than the real deal.

575
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:53,368
Scott: Yeah.

576
00:31:53,388 --> 00:31:58,479
Rym: Partly, I think it's the average podcast is not of that many episodes or listeners.

577
00:31:58,761 --> 00:31:58,963
Scott: Yep.

578
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:08,276
Rym: We have this weird conundrum of having, you know, we were in Libsyn near the beginning, so we've got 700-something episodes, any of which can be downloaded at any random time.

579
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:08,478
Rym: Right.

580
00:32:08,518 --> 00:32:24,150
Scott: If you add it up, the bandwidth from all the downloads of all the episodes of GeekNights that have ever existed in a month, right, and then you multiply that by the, you know, number of bits, and you look at the Amazon S3 bandwidth cost, even though they've gone way down, that's a lot of fucking money.

581
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,190
Scott: We cannot afford that.

582
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:29,490
Scott: But yeah, S3 is way awesome.

583
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:34,273
Scott: You should just use it, even if it's slightly difficult for you to, you know, get it going on.

584
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:36,414
Scott: It's really not all that hard.

585
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:42,089
Scott: Just ignore a lot of the fancy features, make sure you have all your files set to private, and that's it.

586
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:47,039
Scott: But, here are some of the fancy features that S3 has that people don't know about, right?

587
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:50,534
Scott: There's the reduced redundancy storage, which is like, see these files?

588
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:53,746
Scott: I don't care if they get deleted by accident sometimes.

589
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:55,423
Scott: Obviously if they all got deleted, that would suck.

590
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:59,401
Scott: But, you know, try to keep them safe, but don't worry about it.

591
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:02,210
Scott: And what Amazon does is they charge you less for those files.

592
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:05,610
Scott: You can actually do it on a file-by-file basis on the same bucket.

593
00:33:06,372 --> 00:33:06,614
Scott: Right?

594
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:14,333
Scott: And if a file gets closed, they just delete it, and they send you a message like, hey, that file got deleted, just so you know.

595
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:19,690
Scott: And what you use this for is if there are files that you can regenerate.

596
00:33:19,892 --> 00:33:26,437
Scott: So, for example, let's say you're generating thumbnails of images, and you're storing the thumbnails, so that next time you don't have to regenerate them.

597
00:33:26,457 --> 00:33:27,630
Scott: You can just serve them up directly.

598
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:37,409
Scott: But you don't really care if the thumbnail gets deleted by accident, because hell, you can just serve it, you can just regenerate it from, because you have the originals are not in reduced redundancy storage, and the thumbnails are.

599
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,657
Rym: So think of it as like, cheaper storage caching.

600
00:33:40,678 --> 00:33:43,450
Scott: Yeah, it's like cheap storage if you don't give a shit.

601
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:43,731
Scott: Or

602
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:55,170
Rym: like, say you have a file you want to give to someone that's large, and you put it up to get people to download, maybe monetized or whatever, you put it there because you're only going to have it available for a short amount of time, you don't need to keep it forever, you don't care.

603
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:03,250
Scott: Now here's the real great thing about S3, is they added, well, you always had this ability, but now it's even better, is static websites.

604
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:15,929
Scott: If you've got a website, and you don't want to use WordPress or Tumblr or any, you know, sort of you know, dynamic web application to host it, you just want static HTML and JPEGs and JavaScripts, right?

605
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:27,330
Scott: It's really good for something that's pretty much all JavaScripts, like a WebGL or application, you know, or something that hits an API in some other machine, but you don't want to actually set up an Apache server because the actual, it's all JavaScript.

606
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:35,020
Scott: You can just serve a static website entirely from S3, and it costs almost nothing, unless you get a bajillion visitors.

607
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:45,464
Rym: Or, one option is if you need to do dynamic stuff, and say you get some hosting for that, you can put all your static files, like if it's a media site on the S3, so it's secure and it's available.

608
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:50,899
Rym: in case you're you know, somewhat shitty web hosting goes down, you can just bring up web hosting somewhere else and point at the same stuff.

609
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,656
Scott: Yep, but that could become expensive.

610
00:34:52,696 --> 00:35:07,887
Scott: I even calculated, if you're going to do even something like a web comic, right, how big your JPEGs are, multiplied by how many times the JPEGs are downloaded per month, times the bandwidth cost, it can actually become like 80 bucks a month just to put your webcomic JPEGs in S3.

611
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:38,897
Scott: Like, Penny Arcade probably could afford it, but it'd be a lot of monies compared to, say, you know, Linode, where they don't care how many as long as you don't go over your bandwidth limit, you know, it could be 20, you know, the cheapest Linode is 20 bucks a month and gives you a big limit, multiple gigabytes at no additional cost until you go over that limit, so if your number is under that, you know, you might pay, you'll pay 20 bucks a month with Linode, but your bandwidth, even at half that limit on S3, it's going to cost you more than 20 bucks just for the

612
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:39,078
Rym: JPEGs.

613
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:43,509
Rym: Now, this is why we use the subsidized Linode, because an episode of GeekNights is, what, 60 megs or so?

614
00:35:44,051 --> 00:35:45,443
Scott: Well, we use Libsyn, not Lin--.

615
00:35:45,464 --> 00:35:49,381
Rym: Yeah, Libsyn, but, you know, 60 megs or so per episode.

616
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:50,330
Scott: Yeah, it's a lot.

617
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,181
Rym: Times listeners, times the long tail.

618
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:54,866
Scott: Yeah, but it's pretty cool.

619
00:35:56,372 --> 00:36:00,150
Scott: You know, in addition to the S3, they've got this other thing, which is the CloudFront, right?

620
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,423
Rym: I have not used that at all.

621
00:36:01,444 --> 00:36:05,689
Scott: So the way the CloudFront works is basically you say, "Hey, CloudFront, yeah?

622
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,374
Scott: Create a

623
00:36:06,434 --> 00:36:06,919
Scott: CloudFront.".

624
00:36:06,939 --> 00:36:08,858
Scott: And they say, "Okay, do you want streaming or

625
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:09,303
Scott: regular?".

626
00:36:09,404 --> 00:36:11,869
Scott: And you say, "You can choose one or the other or both," or whatever, right?

627
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:16,495
Scott: And you say, "Okay, CloudFront, you see that machine, that S3 bucket over

628
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:16,737
Scott: there.".

629
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:19,039
Scott: Well, yeah, serve that, okay?

630
00:36:19,462 --> 00:36:30,290
Scott: So what this does is, out in front of the--people, you tell--instead of having people visit your S3 bucket and getting the files from the bucket, you use the DNS entry for the CloudFront.

631
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:36,130
Scott: So people visit the CloudFront, and what happens is they're actually going to end up at a local server.

632
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:43,303
Scott: It will take the files from your bucket and send them to servers all around the world, right, where people can get them from.

633
00:36:43,323 --> 00:36:51,770
Scott: So that way, if someone reads your webcomic in France, they actually download the JPEG from a French server, and if they're in California, they download the JPEG from a Californian server.

634
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:53,870
Scott: And they keep adding new edge locations.

635
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,830
Scott: They just added a new edge location in, like, Tokyo or the South--you know, Southeast Asia.

636
00:36:58,632 --> 00:37:14,555
Scott: So if you want to, you know, host videos online or stream videos online, you can use the streaming CloudFront, and now people can stream your videos from a server near them to watch it more quickly instead of having the whole world stream videos from one place, you know, one server.

637
00:37:14,576 --> 00:37:16,454
Scott: This costs a lot of money.

638
00:37:16,474 --> 00:37:19,041
Scott: The more bandwidth you use, it costs even more money.

639
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:24,030
Scott: But if you actually need that feature, which a lot of people do, it's so easy.

640
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:25,203
Scott: It's like three clicks.

641
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:25,850
Scott: It's great.

642
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:29,061
Scott: The thing is, CloudFront is even better than that.

643
00:37:29,343 --> 00:37:32,818
Scott: You can actually use CloudFront without an S3 bucket.

644
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,110
Scott: You can just have it point at any old DNS entry anywhere.

645
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:39,444
Scott: So you can have CloudFront point at some machine.

646
00:37:39,485 --> 00:37:43,510
Scott: you've got set even on Linode, but usually you're going to point it at an Amazon machine.

647
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:52,075
Scott: And you can have an application that serves up dynamic shit, as long as it always serves the same thing at the same URL, right?

648
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:54,642
Scott: And then CloudFront will serve that out front.

649
00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:57,955
Scott: So, for example, you know, I was talking about thumbnails before.

650
00:37:58,419 --> 00:38:10,619
Scott: You could write a thing that will thumbnail images and serve them out, and then people hit the CloudFront, the CloudFront hits your server, the server generates the thumbnail, sends the thumbnail to the CloudFront.

651
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:26,379
Scott: Now that thumbnail is in 20 places in the world where anyone can get it easily without even hitting your server, and in case that expires out in the world, you know, the cache expires and people need to hit your server again, you've stored the thumbnail in S3 where you can get it again without having to generate it again.

652
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:30,641
Scott: So you can make like the ultimate thumbnail generator amongst other things.

653
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:38,016
Scott: You could have all sorts of crazy ideas of ways to generate stuff, but the thing is you can't use query parameters in the URL.

654
00:38:38,056 --> 00:38:39,509
Scott: It has to be the URL itself.

655
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:45,566
Scott: So you need to have some sort of code like slash with slash 100 slash, you know, something like that.

656
00:38:45,607 --> 00:38:47,769
Scott: You can't do question mark with equals.

657
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:48,407
Scott: That will not work.

658
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:57,349
Scott: But yeah, I mean, I'm not going to go through all the Amazon web services just because there's so many of them, but they've got a lot.

659
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,810
Rym: They're surprisingly easy to use, too.

660
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,362
Scott: Well, here's the thing.

661
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,883
Scott: I'm not going to...

662
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,410
Rym: Are they easy to use if you understand networking and basic system administration?

663
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,725
Scott: Well, sort of, right?

664
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:12,618
Scott: I mean, you know, I'm not going to just be a salesman for Amazon here.

665
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:13,770
Scott: There are some problems, right?

666
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,210
Scott: The major problem they have is that they have this web interface, the console.

667
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,650
Scott: It kind of sucks.

668
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:23,430
Scott: I mean, I use it, and it's getting better, but it still sucks in many ways.

669
00:39:23,953 --> 00:39:26,460
Scott: And a lot of times what happens is they add new services.

670
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,620
Scott: For example, they have Route 53, which is awesome DNS service, and there's no interface for it on the console.

671
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:34,298
Scott: The only interface for it is the API.

672
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:42,078
Scott: So you have to open up your whatever programming language you use, load up the API library, and that's the only way you can do anything with Route 53.

673
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:43,854
Scott: Their DNS service is with the API.

674
00:39:44,521 --> 00:39:46,036
Scott: And a lot of the stuff is like that.

675
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:51,170
Scott: They keep adding more stuff to the console, but they seem to put a lot of... They have a new service.

676
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,897
Scott: They'll just put the service out there before it's in the console.

677
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,109
Scott: They have no problem with that.

678
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,179
Scott: The console is like its own separate thing that goes at its own pace.

679
00:39:58,825 --> 00:40:02,196
Scott: And as a result, there's a lot of alternative GUIs.

680
00:40:02,216 --> 00:40:09,740
Scott: I think there's a Firefox extension with a GUI for S3, and Ubuntu has Ubuntu Landscape you can use to manage a group of Ubuntu servers.

681
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:18,018
Scott: So if you use Ubuntu in EC2, you can use Landscape to manage all your EC2 machines instead of using the Amazon console.

682
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:21,907
Scott: There's all kinds of stuff like that going on about there.

683
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:23,670
Scott: I don't know.

684
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:31,010
Scott: The other problem with it, and this is actually I think my biggest problem with it, is take Linode, our hosting for the web.

685
00:40:32,315 --> 00:40:36,462
Scott: If there's a problem with the hardware, our Linode is a virtual machine.

686
00:40:36,543 --> 00:40:37,675
Scott: It's not a real computer.

687
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:41,557
Scott: It's on a real computer, but it's not the computer.

688
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:42,449
Scott: It's a virtual machine.

689
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,403
Rym: Which is kind of the way all hosting and servers are going.

690
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:48,570
Scott: Unless you pay for dedicated hosting, which is dumb.

691
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,017
Rym: No, but even then, that's the end run right now.

692
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:53,289
Rym: That's the next big horizon.

693
00:40:54,193 --> 00:41:01,594
Scott: Because it's most economical is to have a few big machines, and then to use the entire machine, you need to split it up into smaller machines.

694
00:41:01,615 --> 00:41:06,341
Rym: And also, unlike the old early days of virtualization, I mean with hypervisors and Linux kernels.

695
00:41:06,623 --> 00:41:10,142
Scott: And the stuff they have in the CPUs now, like vPro and VTX.

696
00:41:10,223 --> 00:41:19,110
Rym: Yep, so basically running a virtual machine is not like the old days, where you're basically emulating an entire hardware stack for this computer to think it's real.

697
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,430
Rym: The computer knows it's fake, and acts accordingly related to the hardware.

698
00:41:26,965 --> 00:41:32,038
Scott: So if something happens, to say the hardware that our line node happens to be on, they just move it to another one.

699
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:33,410
Scott: We don't even know that there's a problem.

700
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,398
Scott: Right?

701
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:43,756
Scott: But Amazon, I get emails from them every once in a while like, "Hey, yeah, that machine that your virtual machine is on had a hardware problem, you should move

702
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:43,918
Scott: it.".

703
00:41:44,384 --> 00:41:48,117
Scott: And I'm like, "I don't have time to take that service down right now and bring it back

704
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:48,380
Scott: up.".

705
00:41:49,027 --> 00:41:49,330
Scott: Right?

706
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,704
Scott: It's like, "What do you mean?

707
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:52,745
Scott: the hardware broke that my machine was on?

708
00:41:52,786 --> 00:41:53,674
Scott: It's a virtual machine!

709
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:54,725
Scott: Fucking move it live!

710
00:41:54,785 --> 00:41:55,250
Scott: Zen can do

711
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:55,513
Scott: that!".

712
00:41:55,675 --> 00:41:56,669
Scott: But they're not doing that.

713
00:41:57,256 --> 00:41:58,350
Scott: So that's sort of annoying.

714
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,235
Rym: I didn't know that.

715
00:41:59,457 --> 00:42:13,230
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, Zen, if you have a Zen service, you can just live while a computer is running, move it to a different machine without turning it without turning it off or disrupting service for even a millisecond.

716
00:42:13,554 --> 00:42:14,550
Rym: It's kind of amazing.

717
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:16,289
Scott: But Amazon doesn't do that.

718
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:25,677
Scott: So if you're buying an EC2 machine, and it's running, and that particular physical machine that it is running on breaks, you'll actually go down.

719
00:42:26,322 --> 00:42:27,068
Scott: They'll let you know.

720
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:34,507
Scott: You might even be able to detect that you went down if you use CloudWatch, which is a monitoring service, which sort of has a little bit of jankiness to it.

721
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:36,430
Scott: It doesn't monitor everything you want it to monitor.

722
00:42:36,912 --> 00:42:40,510
Scott: And it doesn't monitor it so quickly, even if you pay for the detailed monitoring.

723
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:46,630
Scott: It's like once a minute, you know, so you're gonna lose some minutes, right, if you're relying on CloudWatch.

724
00:42:47,616 --> 00:42:51,393
Scott: But, you know, it'll send you an email like, "Hey, shit's down.

725
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:51,798
Scott: Fix

726
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:51,899
Scott: it.".

727
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,708
Scott: It's like, "What the fuck?

728
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,122
Scott: My shit should never go down.

729
00:42:54,344 --> 00:42:54,849
Scott: What am I paying

730
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:54,990
Scott: for?".

731
00:42:55,952 --> 00:42:56,216
Scott: Right?

732
00:42:56,236 --> 00:42:57,086
Scott: I don't know.

733
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,908
Scott: So yeah, but some of the other things they have, right, they've got.

734
00:43:01,474 --> 00:43:02,950
Scott: uh, what's it called?

735
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:09,353
Scott: They have SimpleDB, which is like a really dumb, it's basically a database that's flat tables with no relations that you can use.

736
00:43:09,918 --> 00:43:13,810
Scott: They've got, the RDS I already mentioned is, here's a MySQL server or an Oracle server.

737
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,030
Scott: ElastiCache, which is, here's a memcache server.

738
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:29,350
Scott: Elastic Beanstalk is sort of this weird thing, which is if you write a Java application in a particular way, you can run it, instead of running it on machines, you can run it on Elastic Beanstalk.

739
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:34,299
Scott: If you run it on the Elastic Beanstalk, it's one click and that's it.

740
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:34,744
Scott: You're good.

741
00:43:34,764 --> 00:43:39,049
Scott: It automatically scales the Beanstalk to handle whatever the traffic is.

742
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:45,130
Scott: So if you suddenly get a slash dotting, they'll just power up your Beanstalk and it'll get really big and bust into the giant's house.

743
00:43:45,593 --> 00:43:49,150
Scott: And then when no one's visiting the next day because your site sucks and they hated it.

744
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:49,918
Rym: Back to a little bean?

745
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:50,969
Scott: Back to a little tiny bean.

746
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:51,832
Scott: Right?

747
00:43:51,893 --> 00:43:56,809
Scott: Just live, real time auto-scaling if you have the kind of application that can run on that.

748
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,817
Scott: That's pretty great if you can have that kind of application.

749
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:00,222
Rym: Yup.

750
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:18,090
Rym: I guess in general, this whole cloud thing, especially with Amazon, my personal use of it is that if I need a server for testing, like I have an image or something, it's really easy to instantiate a bunch of whatever I need in a hurry and not have to physically rack them somewhere.

751
00:44:19,232 --> 00:44:24,530
Scott: But I mean, you can do that other hosting providers, like you can just go to Linode, you sign up, you'll have your Linode in a few minutes.

752
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:28,630
Scott: But the Amazon interface is just like start machine, start machine, start machine.

753
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:30,870
Rym: And more importantly, stop machine.

754
00:44:31,513 --> 00:44:32,221
Rym: Here's a good example.

755
00:44:32,241 --> 00:44:37,190
Rym: Say I've got a company, well maybe I do have a company, where we have to do QA on some software.

756
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:43,918
Rym: So you need like a hundred different environments to do QA to make sure nothing's weird in some fiddly environment or whatever.

757
00:44:43,938 --> 00:44:45,110
Scott: A lot of people are using it that way.

758
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:50,589
Rym: So you could have one of all those environments and maintain them all, all the time.

759
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:52,161
Rym: Or you could virtualize it.

760
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:53,352
Rym: So that's good.

761
00:44:53,412 --> 00:44:56,950
Rym: You know, make a virtual image for each one and then run it on your Zen server locally.

762
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:02,749
Scott: But then your Zen server will take all night loading up an image, running it, turning it down, loading up a new one, running it.

763
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,410
Rym: And you can run a lot at the same time on a Zen server.

764
00:45:05,511 --> 00:45:12,750
Rym: But I don't need a gigantic hunk of hardware capable of doing all this for the four times a year that something's released.

765
00:45:12,851 --> 00:45:15,374
Scott: And then when it breaks, you have to fix it.

766
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,334
Scott: So Amazon, you have all these machines.

767
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:18,850
Scott: If the hard drives crash, you have to replace them.

768
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:27,214
Rym: You can have a machine with whatever Linux and whatever database on it you want and you just like, turn it on, you're paying for it while it's running, do your test, turn it off.

769
00:45:27,598 --> 00:45:29,779
Rym: You can turn them all on at the same fucking time.

770
00:45:29,921 --> 00:45:31,779
Scott: Yeah, you won't pay any more money for doing it that way.

771
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:38,182
Scott: Here's the problem though, there is if you just get an account as a normal person and start reusing it, there's a machine limit 20 machines at once, an EC2.

772
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:44,650
Scott: To get more, you have to ask for more and you have to give them a good reason why you want more and then they'll probably give them to you.

773
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,173
Scott: But if you go and say, "I need a thousand machines," they'll be like, "Uh,

774
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:47,395
Scott: no.".

775
00:45:48,003 --> 00:45:49,637
Rym: They might say, "Okay, but

776
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:50,524
Rym: money.".

777
00:45:51,371 --> 00:45:59,277
Scott: Yeah, if you actually ask for, if you send an email in like, "I need a thousand machines," and your reason is legitimate, they'll probably send a salesman to talk to you.

778
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:05,862
Scott: But they actually have some, you know, let me tell you some of the crazy things they have that people don't realize they have, right?

779
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:08,043
Scott: So they have Amazon Import Export.

780
00:46:08,063 --> 00:46:08,668
Scott: You know what this is?

781
00:46:09,697 --> 00:46:15,250
Scott: You can send them a hard drive or a USB stick, pretty much anything with USB on it, right?

782
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:17,636
Scott: Or serial ATA.

783
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:25,718
Scott: They will plug it into Amazon and load or unload data to or from it to S3 or from S3.

784
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,558
Scott: So if you have an insane amount of data, let's say you got a terabyte of data.

785
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:30,670
Rym: Yeah, you're gonna upload that shit?

786
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:37,394
Scott: You're gonna upload that to S3 and pay the bandwidth cost, or you can pay the Amazon Import Export fee overnight.

787
00:46:37,415 --> 00:46:38,182
Scott: them a drive, right?

788
00:46:39,071 --> 00:46:42,306
Scott: And they'll dump the terabyte of data into an S3 bucket of your choosing.

789
00:46:42,528 --> 00:46:43,537
Scott: Or, the opposite.

790
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,910
Scott: I've got a terabyte of data.

791
00:46:45,051 --> 00:46:46,750
Scott: all my, you know, I run Inger.

792
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,090
Scott: I have 10 terabytes of images people have uploaded.

793
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,030
Scott: I wanna put them on a hard drive and bring them to my house.

794
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:55,616
Scott: You send them some drives and they'll let you download the S3 bucket onto the drives.

795
00:46:55,656 --> 00:46:56,405
Scott: Yeah.

796
00:46:56,506 --> 00:47:04,790
Scott: It does have this high cost, like just to start, so it's not worth it unless the amount of data is already really big, like terabytes.

797
00:47:05,852 --> 00:47:08,950
Scott: You know, if it's less than that, you're actually better off paying the bandwidth cost.

798
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:09,212
Scott: There's

799
00:47:09,232 --> 00:47:22,048
Rym: also, I haven't done this yet, but I'm pretty sure that if you use one of the open virtual machine image formats, like you make a virtual machine in like VirtualBox or whatever, if you use the right open formats, I'm pretty sure you can just put them on Amazon and run them.

800
00:47:23,231 --> 00:47:23,979
Scott: Uh, no.

801
00:47:24,182 --> 00:47:25,536
Scott: You can't, not that I know of.

802
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:26,830
Rym: Or maybe it's the virtual app machine.

803
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:29,030
Rym: There's one thing that I know you can upload and run.

804
00:47:29,231 --> 00:47:30,730
Rym: I haven't done it yet because I needed to.

805
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:41,417
Scott: The way it works is you have to actually, it's called an AMI, an Amazon Machine Instance, so you have to build an AMI, which is basically an ISO for Amazon or an image.

806
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,496
Rym: Amazon Web Services, let's see, VM import.

807
00:47:43,618 --> 00:47:47,782
Rym: VM import lets you import virtual machine images in any standard format.

808
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:48,328
Scott: Oh, that's new.

809
00:47:48,368 --> 00:47:49,075
Scott: I haven't heard of that one.

810
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,165
Rym: Yeah, that's the thing I'm talking about.

811
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:52,023
Scott: But that just shows you like all they're really doing here.

812
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:54,349
Rym: Oh wow, they accept more than, because I knew they took VMDK.

813
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:57,033
Rym: They take VHD and some formats, I don't know.

814
00:47:57,053 --> 00:48:00,650
Scott: Did you see the newest VirtualBox actually supports four different formats?

815
00:48:00,972 --> 00:48:01,416
Scott: It's great.

816
00:48:01,941 --> 00:48:03,354
Scott: I was like, whoa, what a great improvement.

817
00:48:03,374 --> 00:48:05,778
Scott: It supports VMDK, VMX, and two other ones.

818
00:48:06,324 --> 00:48:07,529
Scott: It's like, whoa, that's awesome.

819
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:09,842
Scott: That's something I didn't know about.

820
00:48:09,862 --> 00:48:12,063
Rym: I've been rocking the VirtualBox a lot lately.

821
00:48:12,144 --> 00:48:15,073
Scott: Yeah, but usually, the thing is VirtualBox is only good on Windows.

822
00:48:15,114 --> 00:48:16,468
Scott: If you try to use it on Linux, it sucks.

823
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,609
Rym: No, you run Linux on it on Windows.

824
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:19,637
Scott: Exactly what I do.

825
00:48:19,657 --> 00:48:21,233
Rym: You don't run Windows on it on Linux.

826
00:48:21,395 --> 00:48:22,727
Scott: No, not at all.

827
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:35,917
Scott: But yeah, they've got, you know, it's basically, all they've really done is they took web hosting, just normal old hosting, and they kept adding features to it all over the place that have sort of made this crazy thing.

828
00:48:35,957 --> 00:48:37,350
Scott: I mean, they've got a queue service.

829
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,465
Scott: It's not as good as running your own, like, RabbitMQ or something like that.

830
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:45,434
Rym: Oh, it's really, dude, to upload an image, literally, there's an API, and they give you a tool that uses the API.

831
00:48:45,515 --> 00:48:48,300
Scott: Yeah, if you use the API, you can do everything.

832
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:51,329
Scott: But the console is where it's easy to do things.

833
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:57,636
Rym: And there are, like, for S3, like, if you want to do, you know, some of the more advanced stuff, you can't just do it by default.

834
00:48:58,161 --> 00:49:08,263
Rym: But there are free, and I found some actually relatively cheap programs where people implement good interfaces through the API to do stuff on Amazon.

835
00:49:08,283 --> 00:49:08,586
Scott: Yep.

836
00:49:08,748 --> 00:49:20,590
Scott: But it's like, you know, they've got, like, load balancers, and they got virtual private cloud where you can make, like, a closed network on Amazon and then link it to your network by paying money to get, like, a VPN.

837
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:24,060
Scott: Like, it's crazy, some of the stuff that they offer here.

838
00:49:24,121 --> 00:49:27,736
Rym: There's a big move in that front, in, like, big enterprise world.

839
00:49:27,777 --> 00:49:34,222
Scott: Right, it's like you have some racks in your office, but you also want to add some servers to it that don't really need to be in your racks.

840
00:49:34,303 --> 00:49:35,838
Scott: You buy some Amazon machines.

841
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:36,404
Rym: Or they need to be.

842
00:49:36,444 --> 00:49:38,685
Scott: But they might as well be on your network.

843
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:39,654
Scott: They're actually using the DNS.

844
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:42,498
Scott: They need to be in your production cage conceptually.

845
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:44,040
Rym: Like, they need to be in the same network.

846
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,079
Scott: They're actually, you know, effectively might as well be machines on your rack.

847
00:49:48,261 --> 00:49:56,277
Rym: And something I've run into before is that even if you've got some rack space, you might not have enough power in the area, which is often problematic.

848
00:49:56,984 --> 00:50:01,633
Rym: At my previous company, we had a point where we couldn't get enough power in our rack to put more servers in it.

849
00:50:01,936 --> 00:50:02,988
Scott: Wow.

850
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:04,118
Scott: That's great.

851
00:50:04,178 --> 00:50:06,805
Scott: Even if you had UPSs and, like, generators.

852
00:50:06,825 --> 00:50:11,650
Rym: Well, no, it's the data center says you're getting the maximum number of amps we can provide currently.

853
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:12,475
Scott: Oh, okay.

854
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:15,370
Scott: Yeah, power is a big thing people don't think about.

855
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:16,238
Scott: So, it's like, you're out.

856
00:50:16,845 --> 00:50:19,430
Scott: Here's the real thing about what Amazon means, right?

857
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:20,501
Scott: What does this mean?

858
00:50:20,622 --> 00:50:21,046
Scott: Why?

859
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:29,652
Scott: What's the big deal about, you know, a hosting company that happens to sell books and also, you know, has all these extra stuff?

860
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,338
Scott: You know what it means?

861
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:35,330
Scott: Guys, system administrators are kind of in trouble, right?

862
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,298
Rym: Well, no, they're not.

863
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:44,028
Rym: You think they are, but I have watched what Amazon things look like when people who aren't competent system administrators try to use it.

864
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:51,330
Scott: The thing is, right, is that most people out there just, you know, it's not about the systems for most people.

865
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,990
Scott: It's about the applications, right?

866
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:58,057
Scott: So, if you have developers, good developers can do this.

867
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:58,965
Scott: They don't need, right?

868
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:01,895
Scott: But, you know, like at work, I just do it.

869
00:51:02,198 --> 00:51:04,016
Scott: I don't need someone else to do this for me.

870
00:51:04,097 --> 00:51:11,229
Scott: But, if we had racks in the office with this, right, and they had internet connections and routers and everything, I couldn't do it.

871
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:11,995
Scott: That's the whole job.

872
00:51:12,015 --> 00:51:12,561
Scott: Yeah, well, here's an example.

873
00:51:12,581 --> 00:51:16,400
Rym: All right, say Scott's managing the server at his company just because he's the one who's competent to do it.

874
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:16,642
Rym: Fine.

875
00:51:16,683 --> 00:51:22,260
Scott: Right, like, I can manage the software on one or two machines, but I couldn't manage the network.

876
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:23,876
Rym: The machine locks hard.

877
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:27,030
Rym: So, have you set up out-of-band communication to reboot it hard?

878
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,935
Scott: Yeah, it's like, now I gotta get up and go into the server room.

879
00:51:29,955 --> 00:51:34,440
Rym: Actually, most good data centers have remote hands where you call a guy and say, "Hey, go reboot my fucking

880
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:34,784
Rym: server.".

881
00:51:34,804 --> 00:51:42,503
Scott: Right, but, you see, the point is, like, at that point when you actually have to deal with that stuff, that becomes another job, right?

882
00:51:43,008 --> 00:51:46,864
Scott: So, for someone like me, it's like, I can't do that job and the job I'm doing.

883
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:52,600
Scott: That would be two jobs, but now Amazon is doing that job instead of an employee at our company doing that job.

884
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:57,024
Rym: Yeah, it's almost like Amazon, like, these services, they're great for the low end.

885
00:51:57,104 --> 00:51:58,560
Rym: Like, you've got, you're a small company.

886
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,975
Rym: You don't have the resources.

887
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:05,370
Rym: You don't want to commit to buying hardware, the upfront costs of, you know, buying all these servers to do stuff.

888
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,609
Rym: It really reduces the upfront cost to get going.

889
00:52:08,474 --> 00:52:12,863
Rym: And at the very top end, you just can't manage because you've got so much stuff that's going on.

890
00:52:12,904 --> 00:52:16,682
Rym: You need so much horsepower, it's more economical to use the Amazon stuff in bulk.

891
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:23,510
Rym: The middle in between the two, there's kind of this dip where it is more economical to have a system administrator and your own racks.

892
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,177
Scott: Yeah, well, there's two things going on here, right?

893
00:52:26,197 --> 00:52:34,399
Scott: Number one, you'd actually be surprised, Amazon has done everything in their power to get every freaking certification in the goddamn universe that they can get.

894
00:52:34,743 --> 00:52:42,888
Scott: So, like, if you, even if you're a sensitive financial or a government thing, they actually have a thing called GovCloud, specifically for hosting of U.S.

895
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:46,241
Scott: government things because it meets all the regulations necessary to do so.

896
00:52:46,382 --> 00:52:51,270
Scott: So, anonymous punk kids grow up, get a degree, work for that, profit.

897
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:59,717
Scott: They specifically went out and got, like, FSMA certifications and all these certifications that financial people wouldn't be afraid to use their shit.

898
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:05,514
Scott: So they could go to big enterprises and be like, it's okay to use our Amazon cloud, we have all the certs.

899
00:53:06,424 --> 00:53:13,170
Scott: Number two, the real economical problem with Amazon is the server sizes on EC2, right?

900
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,076
Scott: They recently added the micro size.

901
00:53:16,298 --> 00:53:19,410
Scott: The micro size is so cheap, it's actually free.

902
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:28,179
Scott: If you've never had an Amazon web services account, which is actually not that many people, for example, if you use Mechanical Turk, like, five years ago, guess what, you've got an account.

903
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:31,270
Scott: If you've got an Alexa account, guess what, you've got an account, right?

904
00:53:31,731 --> 00:53:46,482
Scott: But if you've never had an account before and you open an Amazon web services account, right, not a regular book buying account, but a web services account, which will be linked to your book buying account, but whatever, you get one free micro instance for a year.

905
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:53,735
Scott: And after that, if you pay in advance, if you, let's say I want to buy a micro instance forever because I'm running a tiny blog and it can totally do it.

906
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,309
Scott: If I pay for three years of micro instance, guess how much it costs?

907
00:53:59,170 --> 00:53:59,574
Rym: Five bucks.

908
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,281
Scott: Eighty bucks for three years.

909
00:54:02,422 --> 00:54:03,230
Scott: That's not too bad.

910
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:06,824
Rym: The micro instance is powerful enough for, like, a little web server.

911
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:10,341
Scott: We pay like forty a month for the lineup.

912
00:54:10,361 --> 00:54:13,069
Scott: They pay in advance, but it's like a thousand a year or something like that.

913
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:15,210
Scott: But it's way better than the micro instance.

914
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,066
Scott: The thing with the micro instance, they're not kidding when they say it's a micro.

915
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:20,563
Scott: It has no swap.

916
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:24,440
Scott: It gets one CPU unit as they refer to it, right?

917
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:26,178
Scott: It's mad weak.

918
00:54:26,602 --> 00:54:29,650
Scott: But for, you know, most people's stuff, it's enough.

919
00:54:30,272 --> 00:54:34,519
Scott: You know, your little blog that no one visits, you could probably put ten of those in a micro instance, right?

920
00:54:34,903 --> 00:54:36,035
Scott: It's no problem at all.

921
00:54:36,522 --> 00:54:37,109
Scott: But here's the thing.

922
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,854
Scott: The small instance, here's the problem.

923
00:54:40,439 --> 00:54:47,750
Scott: The small instance is actually not quite as good as our line node, maybe similar, whatever.

924
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:53,168
Scott: But it costs at very minimum, like, eighty bucks a month.

925
00:54:53,654 --> 00:54:56,038
Scott: Whereas you can get a line node for twenty a month.

926
00:54:56,341 --> 00:55:03,668
Scott: So it's that space in between the micro instance and the small instance that you can go to regular web hosting.

927
00:55:03,689 --> 00:55:06,981
Scott: Don't go to Amazon because you're going to lose money as soon as you need a small instance.

928
00:55:07,021 --> 00:55:10,255
Scott: You're going to lose money because the bandwidth costs their scale.

929
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:13,426
Scott: So if too many visitors come, suddenly you owe them a lot of money.

930
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:17,043
Scott: Whereas on another web host, you probably would have the same bill every month.

931
00:55:17,103 --> 00:55:21,486
Rym: For the database ones, the RDS, if you want to get those, there are a ton of different sizes.

932
00:55:21,506 --> 00:55:24,275
Scott: They're the same sizes as the EC2 machines.

933
00:55:24,335 --> 00:55:26,316
Rym: A small RDS is a small EC2.

934
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:28,255
Rym: I'm going to go through just the RAM on them.

935
00:55:28,275 --> 00:55:31,706
Rym: They have a small, large, and extra large.

936
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:34,756
Rym: Small, 1.7 gigabytes of RAM.

937
00:55:34,777 --> 00:55:35,488
Scott: You don't need that much.

938
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,635
Rym: Large, 7.5 gigabytes of RAM.

939
00:55:38,676 --> 00:55:39,424
Scott: That's way too much.

940
00:55:39,728 --> 00:55:40,657
Rym: Extra large, 15.

941
00:55:40,657 --> 00:55:43,750
Scott: Yeah, they're also missing a medium size, right?

942
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:46,416
Scott: The only really medium size they have of anything.

943
00:55:46,517 --> 00:55:47,450
Rym: I think that's on purpose.

944
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:48,193
Scott: It is.

945
00:55:48,213 --> 00:55:57,021
Scott: The only really medium size that they have is the high CPU medium, which has five CPU cores and like seven gigs of RAM or something like that.

946
00:55:57,082 --> 00:55:57,790
Scott: It's pretty crazy.

947
00:55:58,314 --> 00:55:59,302
Scott: Or no, I think maybe it's 1.7, I don't know.

948
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:07,629
Scott: But they really don't have a medium machine like something that has, say, two cores, four gigs of RAM, you know, something...

949
00:56:07,771 --> 00:56:11,589
Rym: But notice what I just said earlier about the business need for this.

950
00:56:12,051 --> 00:56:12,940
Rym: Or the personal need.

951
00:56:13,444 --> 00:56:16,576
Rym: The startup, the beginning, the small people, they need it.

952
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,575
Rym: The high-end people, they need it.

953
00:56:18,696 --> 00:56:22,294
Rym: It's in the middle where the usefulness of this kind of drops off for a while.

954
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:27,970
Scott: The space between micro and small and the space between small and large, you know, is where they really hurt.

955
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:32,696
Scott: The other problem they have is that the micro instance can be 64 or 32-bit.

956
00:56:33,242 --> 00:56:37,384
Scott: The small and a couple other sizes can only be 32-bit.

957
00:56:38,953 --> 00:56:40,436
Scott: All the big sizes are 64-bit only.

958
00:56:41,913 --> 00:56:46,432
Scott: If you have a 64-bit application, but you need the small size, you're shit out of luck.

959
00:56:46,978 --> 00:56:47,363
Scott: You can't.

960
00:56:48,474 --> 00:56:51,440
Scott: You need to get the minimum, the large.

961
00:56:51,845 --> 00:56:52,230
Rym: Oh wow.

962
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,443
Rym: Okay, the pricing model.

963
00:56:53,463 --> 00:56:56,233
Rym: I haven't looked at this in a while because I only use S3 personally now.

964
00:56:56,314 --> 00:56:57,870
Rym: I haven't used the rest forever.

965
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,347
Rym: I poked at it, but I didn't really use it.

966
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:03,067
Rym: Data transfer, the rates go up through.

967
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:08,373
Rym: next 524 terabytes a month, this price.

968
00:57:08,434 --> 00:57:11,240
Rym: Next 4 petabytes, this price.

969
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:11,930
Scott: It's like taxes.

970
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,789
Rym: More than 5 petabytes this size.

971
00:57:16,954 --> 00:57:17,684
Scott: It's like taxes.

972
00:57:17,704 --> 00:57:21,810
Scott: You get taxed this percent on your first amount of income and this percent on the next amount of income.

973
00:57:22,518 --> 00:57:23,429
Scott: You know, that's how it works.

974
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,355
Scott: But yeah, it's a really cool thing.

975
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:31,646
Scott: It's really out there and actually it is getting more and more popular with time.

976
00:57:31,707 --> 00:57:33,630
Scott: It's already popular, but it's getting more popular.

977
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:38,135
Scott: I went to the Amazon Web Summit and I heard the CTO of Amazon talk.

978
00:57:38,176 --> 00:57:38,989
Scott: He was actually pretty cool.

979
00:57:39,773 --> 00:57:40,861
Scott: Not super cool, but pretty cool.

980
00:57:41,506 --> 00:57:43,070
Scott: And their room had like a thousand people.

981
00:57:44,273 --> 00:57:46,010
Scott: Maybe not a thousand, but hundreds of people.

982
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:50,556
Rym: In the technology industry, computer, if you're a developer or an IT

983
00:57:50,577 --> 00:57:50,637
Scott: guy,

984
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:59,330
Rym: it is worth your while to at least know what this is, know how to use it, be able to, like if someone said, "Hey, I need an instance of something for something," to like know the basics.

985
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:05,549
Rym: Because it's a huge in-demand skill as kind of like a baseline IT skill going forward.

986
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:13,041
Scott: Even if somebody's a regular old system administrator or somebody knows how to do hosting of websites or whatever it is that you're hosting, right?

987
00:58:13,608 --> 00:58:17,750
Scott: That gets you a long way because in the end all this really is Linux machines.

988
00:58:18,392 --> 00:58:20,961
Scott: Sometimes Windows machines, but really it's Linux machines, right?

989
00:58:21,143 --> 00:58:24,274
Scott: And you SSH to them and you work with them and it's 90% Linux.

990
00:58:25,142 --> 00:58:38,256
Scott: But if someone doesn't have the knowledge of the specifics of all these different Amazon services and how they work, they won't be able to extract the maximum value from it and they won't be able to make it, you know, to get it to work properly.

991
00:58:38,276 --> 00:58:42,759
Scott: You really have to learn a lot of Amazon specific stuff to get the full value here.

992
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:50,354
Scott: So if you bother to learn it, which you can for if you're just learning it and no one's using any of the stuff you set up, it costs you all next to nothing.

993
00:58:50,455 --> 00:58:54,396
Scott: Pennies a month on my Amazon bill personally is like a dollar a month, right?

994
00:58:54,578 --> 00:58:59,790
Scott: Because you're not actually having a high traffic application because it's pay-per-use.

995
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:02,173
Scott: So if no one visits it, you don't pay a bandwidth bill.

996
00:59:02,214 --> 00:59:05,950
Scott: And if you turn your machines off when you're not using them, you don't pay for the CPU time.

997
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:16,206
Scott: So you can learn everything there is to learn for next to nothing and then get a really good job because someone out there really needs someone who is a master of this shit.

998
00:59:24,138 --> 00:59:26,363
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

999
00:59:26,424 --> 00:59:31,400
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1000
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,850
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1001
00:59:37,092 --> 00:59:39,760
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1002
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:43,980
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1003
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,802
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1004
00:59:47,823 --> 00:59:52,367
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1005
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:55,459
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
