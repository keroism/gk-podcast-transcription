1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,535
Scott: It's Wednesday, March 2nd.

2
00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:11,217
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:11,879
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,005
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:19,009
Scott: Tonight, My Little Pony with the magical friendships and such.

6
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:24,898
Scott: Yep, let's do this.

7
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,346
Rym: So I recall back in 2007.

8
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:30,171
Scott: That's a long time ago.

9
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:30,773
Rym: Yeah, it is.

10
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:33,260
Scott: That's, that's like, that's forever.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,216
Rym: And yet we'd been doing GeekNights for a couple years before that.

12
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:40,751
Rym: But, uh, we reviewed El Hazzard, the original O.A.V.

13
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,000
Rym: and we didn't actually rewatch it.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,319
Rym: We just kind of reviewed it from memory because we'd watched it in the last few years.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,536
Scott: Well, I think I did actually rewatch part of it.

16
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:50,160
Rym: Yeah, part of it.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,450
Scott: Well, maybe I don't remember.

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,680
Rym: We watched the whole thing.

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,226
Scott: I don't know.

20
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:53,838
Scott: I don't think we did.

21
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,159
Rym: So I'm actually kind of randomly watching it now.

22
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,002
Scott: The O.A.V.

23
00:00:58,022 --> 00:00:58,527
Scott: or the TV?

24
00:00:58,588 --> 00:00:59,458
Rym: Of course the O.A.V.

25
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:00,674
Rym: Watch the TV.

26
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:02,959
Rym: It seems like a trend like that.

27
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,922
Rym: In Mahou Tsukaitai and all those shows, Tenchi Moyo had the great, like condensed O.A.V that was good.

28
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,319
Rym: And then the TV, there was kind of like a watered down version of the O.A.V.

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,320
Scott: So I wonder what was, you know, what the cause of that was.

30
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:17,560
Scott: Was it because Pat LeVoir had a similar thing, but the TV was still good.

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,440
Scott: But it was also watered down a little.

32
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:27,060
Rym: There was definitely at least like some of the creators were, I don't know, too attached to the idea and were like, oh, I got to make more of this.

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,864
Rym: This is magic.

34
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:29,939
Rym: And they never quite recaptured that magic.

35
00:01:31,303 --> 00:01:36,216
Rym: But anyway, El Hazzard holds up pretty damn well, having watched it now from 2011, almost 30 year old eyes.

36
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:41,420
Rym: I think what helps is that Emily's never seen it.

37
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,539
Rym: So I'm watching it with someone who has never seen El Hazzard.

38
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:57,739
Rym: You know, is it bad that to this day in that show, every single frame of animation that is in the Abba Abba Zoot Zoot music video stands out like a sore thumb in the actual show?

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,598
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

40
00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:04,100
Scott: And whenever the any bug rooms appear whatsoever, just like up, even though what are they saying in the show?

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,580
Scott: The bug rooms only appearing depends dub or sub in the sub.

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,399
Scott: They say like they say something they say.

43
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:11,359
Rym: I don't remember.

44
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:12,384
Scott: Whatever.

45
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:13,616
Scott: They make like a noise like hubbub.

46
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,209
Rym: I don't know.

47
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:15,875
Rym: It's a pretty good show.

48
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:16,419
Rym: I'm enjoying it.

49
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:16,961
Rym: It.

50
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:19,912
Rym: it reminds me, though, that I loved that show when I was in a.

51
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,860
Scott: no, it's a bubble bubble bubble bubble.

52
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,929
Rym: That wasn't the bug room.

53
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,839
Rym: That was that little guy.

54
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,200
Rym: What little guy in the first episode, that little guy who kind of runs by them or whatever.

55
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,165
Scott: I always remember that guy.

56
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:31,880
Rym: I was like, fine, you know, they're in the magical world.

57
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:37,117
Rym: And Makoto is like, all right, Fujisawa, which way back home, Mr.

58
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:38,040
Rym: Fujisawa?

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,506
Rym: Since it's obviously no big deal.

60
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:42,679
Rym: And he's like, I'll just ask the next guy who comes by.

61
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,959
Rym: And that's when Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo.

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,540
Scott: Yeah, but Cat Armor and Drunken Teachers.

63
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:55,560
Rym: You complained about what you thought was excessive fan service in Mahoud Skytie.

64
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:56,485
Rym: Yeah.

65
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:59,100
Rym: Elazzard times a million.

66
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,440
Scott: Really?

67
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:06,260
Scott: I thought I know how Elazzard had some because Elazzard has a scene where there's sort of like the three goddesses are hanging in some sort of spa.

68
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:14,060
Scott: And it's got a scene about 30 percent that it's got the lesbian princess, but that really only comes out all the time.

69
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,293
Rym: All the time.

70
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:17,200
Scott: I don't remember.

71
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,000
Rym: I mostly remember scenes of fighting because I just watched Mahoud Skytie and I was kind of watching it with a critical eye.

72
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:25,879
Rym: I noticed things I didn't notice as a kid.

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,940
Rym: The people are grabbing boobs in the background all the time.

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,972
Scott: Oh, in the background.

75
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:31,114
Scott: Yes.

76
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:33,140
Scott: You mean the king's court?

77
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,220
Rym: No, no, just main characters.

78
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,760
Scott: Because I you know, if it's just the king's court in Elazzard, that's just realistic.

79
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,259
Scott: That's not I mean.

80
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,800
Rym: No, the T&A is off the charts compared to Mahoud Skytie.

81
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,040
Scott: I'll have to rewatch and compare.

82
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:48,332
Scott: Yeah, good show.

83
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:49,020
Scott: I believe it, though.

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,720
Scott: That show definitely had some T&A leanings.

85
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,020
Rym: The show is definitely very telegraphed, though.

86
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,120
Rym: Emily's pulling the thing that I pulled on you with Gundam Siege.

87
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,800
Rym: She's like, ah, Ifarita, that's probably that one, right?

88
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:00,200
Rym: Yeah, I got this shit.

89
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,740
Scott: Because they show you all the characters in the opener.

90
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:10,360
Scott: Except if I made an anime, the opener would not actually show like anything, any characters that weren't in the first episode or anything.

91
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:16,839
Scott: It would just be like, you know, be like the the Master Keaton opener with birds flying, you know, and the sun rising.

92
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,380
Rym: That's actually one of my favorite anime openers ever.

93
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:19,841
Rym: Right.

94
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:24,540
Scott: You know, so nobody will be able to say, oh, I see you put those two characters together in the opener.

95
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:25,960
Scott: They must be going to get it on.

96
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,198
Rym: Oh, I kind of want to watch Master Keaton again now.

97
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:29,740
Rym: Uh, that sucks.

98
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,623
Rym: Not all of it, though.

99
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:34,840
Rym: I want to watch individual episodes like Caliman of the Desert or the wine episode.

100
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:38,280
Rym: So there's not a lot of anime news.

101
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,300
Rym: And of course, we're kind of chomping at the bit to get to the main bit here.

102
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,140
Scott: So, oh, God.

103
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:46,860
Rym: Oh, now it starts.

104
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:50,680
Rym: So I want to talk briefly, just in case no one was aware.

105
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:58,240
Rym: You all realize that Thundercats is getting a reboot slash remake and Studio 4C is doing it, right?

106
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,040
Scott: Well, there's also going to be a CG movie, I think.

107
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:02,632
Rym: No, there isn't.

108
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,559
Scott: It looks off now.

109
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:03,983
Scott: There is.

110
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,040
Scott: It looks like it's the worst.

111
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,052
Rym: There's not going to happen.

112
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:06,580
Rym: It's a rumor.

113
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:09,540
Rym: Just like that Avatar movie that M. Night Shyamalan was going to make before.

114
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,163
Scott: Right.

115
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:11,398
Scott: OK, magic exit jokes.

116
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,024
Scott: Not funny.

117
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,299
Rym: Anyway, not a joke.

118
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,640
Rym: Have you seen Avatar?

119
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,851
Rym: It is not a joke.

120
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:17,880
Rym: I'm not laughing.

121
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,800
Rym: Anyway, the Warner Brothers is getting together Cartoon Network and Studio 4C to make a pretty badass looking Thundercats.

122
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,459
Scott: Well, badass looking so far.

123
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,339
Rym: Well, based on everything I've seen, it looks badass.

124
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,619
Rym: And one big point, Snarf is in it.

125
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,998
Rym: He does not talk.

126
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,460
Scott: You know, the thing is, there are many annoying characters like Jar Jar Binks, right?

127
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,040
Scott: And Snarf is sort of the Jar Jar Binks of Thundercats.

128
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,080
Scott: And many people view him as such, right?

129
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,879
Scott: They want him out of there.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,160
Scott: But unlike Jar Jar Binks, who was like a late and out of place addition, Snarf was always there from the beginning.

131
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:55,320
Rym: I think the reason people don't like Snarf is actually pretty obvious.

132
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,399
Rym: If you think about it, people who care about Thundercats now are people who were kids when we were kids.

133
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:07,420
Rym: Now, being adults, they watch more hardcore, more real, cool stuff, but they still like Thundercats.

134
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:12,640
Rym: But every time Snarf comes out, it's a Tezuka situation where it kind of takes them out of there.

135
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:14,040
Rym: Yeah, this is so awesome.

136
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,276
Rym: And Snarf, Snarf, Snarf.

137
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,680
Scott: The thing is, Snarf is not anywhere nearly as annoying as those other annoying characters such as Jar Jar Binks.

138
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,700
Scott: So it's like, I'm down with Snarf.

139
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,200
Scott: It's not like I'm saying Snarf is my favorite.

140
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,180
Rym: It's a good thing they never made those prequels to Star Wars with Jar Jar Binks in it.

141
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,581
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

142
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:34,660
Scott: I don't really mind that Snarf is going to be quiet because he's still going to be there.

143
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,199
Scott: And he's actually, the design is really cute.

144
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,440
Rym: Yeah, he kind of looks like a cross between those body armor cats from El Hazzar and a Cabot from Tenchi Muyo.

145
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,019
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, you know, I wouldn't have minded that much if he talked either, you know, it's all good.

146
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,980
Scott: But yeah, the thing is, when I think back to my childhood, you know, there were many things I liked.

147
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,419
Scott: I know you were the Mask guy.

148
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,020
Rym: Mask and Thundercats are my thing.

149
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,040
Scott: Yeah, but it's like for me, it was like, you know, there was He-Man and Transformers and Voltron.

150
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,600
Rym: I don't think, I don't know if I liked He-Man.

151
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,680
Rym: I don't have sentient memories of like He-Man.

152
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,640
Scott: I had a lot of He-Man toys.

153
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,200
Rym: But I had a lot of He-Man toys.

154
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,440
Rym: I had Battle Damage Skeletor.

155
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,219
Scott: Oh, yeah, I still have Battle Damage Skeletor.

156
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:12,839
Rym: His Battle Damage stopped working.

157
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:21,279
Scott: He-Man, Voltron, Transformers, Ninja Turtles, you know, but Thundercats was definitely the most of all of them that I was liking.

158
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,377
Rym: I think Mask was my most, but...

159
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,324
Scott: Not today.

160
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,919
Scott: Today would probably be like Macross or something, but, you know, it was...

161
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:29,079
Rym: Or maybe a certain other show we'll get today.

162
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,159
Scott: It's not the most.

163
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,958
Rym: No, not yet.

164
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,360
Rym: But also very important, the famous voice, the only voice of Lion-O is in fact going to be doing the voice.

165
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:38,955
Scott: Oh, thank God.

166
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,000
Rym: Yes, Larry Kenny.

167
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,933
Scott: Because if it wasn't him, it would just be like,

168
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:42,799
Scott: "Samoflange.".

169
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,040
Rym: What the fuck's a Samoflange?

170
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:51,040
Scott: Have those ever been a thing of the day?

171
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,460
Scott: Because those are from the year 2000 or perhaps even earlier.

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,158
Rym: I will check.

173
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,440
Rym: Maybe I will just link to them.

174
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:56,940
Scott: They're ancient.

175
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:59,780
Scott: Well, no, we could use them for a thing of the day.

176
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,980
Scott: Don't just link to them now.

177
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,420
Scott: Why not?

178
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,459
Rym: I got a thing of the day now.

179
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,880
Rym: And people are going to look for it anyway.

180
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,229
Scott: Anyway.

181
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,940
Rym: So have you got any anime related news, comics?

182
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:08,340
Scott: I got a comic related news.

183
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:09,860
Scott: It's an old news.

184
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,019
Scott: It's from some weeks ago.

185
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,079
Scott: It's from December, months ago.

186
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:16,919
Scott: But I don't think I talked about it on the show.

187
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,778
Scott: So I will do that now.

188
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,247
Scott: Haha.

189
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,959
Scott: Look at me bringing up this old news.

190
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,777
Scott: Apparently, right?

191
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:27,779
Scott: If we did a show on it a long time ago, Bone, one of the best comics there is.

192
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,150
Rym: Yep.

193
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,580
Rym: Though, you know, you might want to listen to our review because it's a great comic, but it peters out toward the end.

194
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:36,534
Scott: Some people disagree.

195
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:38,419
Rym: But it's a petering out.

196
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,080
Rym: Kind of what I would say is it's a petering out where you go from a 10 to a nine.

197
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,060
Scott: So, yeah, Bone is an amazing comic.

198
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,680
Scott: You should read it.

199
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:51,560
Scott: And the best way to buy Bone right now is the one volume edition, which is a big, giant book that has the whole thing in it.

200
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:51,934
Scott: You're done.

201
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:52,835
Scott: That's it.

202
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,880
Scott: Do not do because when you put it on the table, it makes a noise.

203
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,120
Scott: But it's black and white.

204
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,160
Scott: The one volume edition, which is good because it was originally done in black and white.

205
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:16,440
Scott: However, in order to sell more copies of Bone, especially in the Scholastic Book Club market, what they have done is they have been over the past years redoing each chapter of Bone one at a time in a colored format.

206
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,060
Scott: So you could buy Bone right today.

207
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:21,639
Scott: You could buy the whole thing in color in a bunch of separate volumes.

208
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:31,280
Scott: But now what they are going to be doing sometime in 2011 is releasing the one volume color Bone.

209
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,360
Rym: Oh, my God.

210
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:44,820
Scott: Hard to hard to make a team to make a two fourteen hundred page color, one volume edition that lays flat when you open it in a in a cardboard slip case.

211
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,920
Scott: It's probably going to be like one hundred dollars.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,860
Scott: Who even fucking knows?

213
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,639
Rym: That's fine.

214
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:53,000
Scott: It's going to be nine and a quarter inches by seven.

215
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:54,720
Scott: And the spine is three inches.

216
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,500
Scott: So very similar to the current one volume edition.

217
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,319
Scott: It's approaching.

218
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:00,759
Rym: Grymore levels.

219
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:02,191
Rym: Grymore.

220
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,020
Scott: Anyway, but anyway, but yeah, probably going to buy this.

221
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:09,540
Scott: If anyone wants a black and white one volume edition, I got an extra.

222
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,319
Rym: We could sell it through the GeekNights merch store.

223
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,757
Scott: I could sell it on Amazon more or better than that.

224
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,860
Scott: But yeah, if you're if you haven't read Bone yet, you know, hold out till the end of the year and you could read the whole thing in color in one volume.

225
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:25,420
Rym: So the coloring job is actually pretty great.

226
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,980
Rym: Like, you might worry that it'd be like those old colorizations about, oh, no, because this is the original guy.

227
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,200
Scott: You know, he didn't do it himself.

228
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,037
Scott: He had this guy help him, but he was still, you know, but I mean, I guess you could consider the coloring canon.

229
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:38,840
Rym: by the way they did it.

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,202
Scott: Absolutely.

231
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:41,120
Rym: And it looks fucking fantastic.

232
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,641
Rym: Oh, yeah.

233
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:51,720
Rym: So things of the day, I was reading anime news, Nina.

234
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,420
Rym: Well, I was looking for some anime news and I enjoy anime news, Nina.

235
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,398
Rym: But that's not my thing of the day.

236
00:10:56,763 --> 00:10:57,560
Scott: Anime news is weird.

237
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,500
Scott: We've talked about it before, but just quickly.

238
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:04,120
Rym: It is surprisingly biting and realistic about anime fandom.

239
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,720
Scott: Usually when someone makes a comic for the purposes of marketing or advertising or, you know, something like that, it's usually terrible.

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,640
Scott: Anime news, Nina, is the only exception I've ever found.

241
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:25,520
Rym: But the current comic that's up there right now, I'll link to it, makes a joke about Family Circus, that terrible old comic that apparently has been running in newspapers for 51 fucking years.

242
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,080
Scott: Always by the same guy or at least credit to the same guy.

243
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,900
Rym: And I remember it as being terrible and insipid and not funny, not in any way funny, not even.

244
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,378
Rym: So I go to the Wikipedia and occasionally Jesus, because we wanted to see, oh, is it really been going for 51 years?

245
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,762
Rym: And yes, that's true.

246
00:11:40,822 --> 00:11:48,419
Rym: But funnily enough, on the Wikipedia page, there's a picture of a Family Circus comic from like the 60s.

247
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:50,859
Rym: And it's actually funny.

248
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:51,541
Rym: Yeah.

249
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,487
Scott: And I guess that's.

250
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:57,760
Scott: I guess Family Circus is one of those things where it was originally actually good.

251
00:11:58,101 --> 00:12:03,360
Scott: So it's quality lifted it up and it was in every newspaper and then it just became an institution.

252
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:05,400
Scott: And then once you're an institution, it's like you have tenure.

253
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,220
Scott: So you just suck and they'll keep printing it because it's fucking Family Circus.

254
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,120
Rym: Especially the whole newspaper comic thing where newspaper comics are the most inoffensive, bland, pathetic pablum I've ever seen.

255
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,580
Scott: Garfield is in the same department.

256
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,420
Scott: It's like because he has tenure, no newspaper will get rid of Garfield.

257
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,260
Scott: He doesn't have to actually make it funny anymore.

258
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:24,240
Scott: I'm pretty sure the oldest of old Garfields might be funny.

259
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:24,986
Scott: You know what?

260
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:26,199
Rym: I don't know.

261
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:28,519
Scott: And at least Garfield and Friends is, even if.

262
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,949
Rym: Yeah, but that's a separate thing.

263
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,039
Rym: We should review that.

264
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,158
Scott: You gotta watch them.

265
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,760
Rym: Thing is, Garfield is actually funniest if you remove Garfield.

266
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,120
Scott: Yeah, well, or rearrange panels randomly.

267
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:40,722
Scott: All right.

268
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:47,200
Scott: So there was this video that I watched just fine at work, but for some reason at Rims House, net neutrality prevented me from loading it with any great speed.

269
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,259
Rym: Yet every other, even though it's Fios.

270
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,120
Rym: Every other YouTube video I was watching at the same time was fine.

271
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:55,460
Scott: Anyway, this video loaded horrendously slowly.

272
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,420
Rym: I blame your laptop.

273
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,467
Scott: No, I don't think so.

274
00:12:57,932 --> 00:12:58,640
Scott: I blame your files.

275
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,514
Scott: So it's called Valparaiso Polk 2011 GoPro HD.

276
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,499
Scott: So you're probably like, what the fuck is that?

277
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,580
Scott: Well, apparently in Valparaiso, which is pretty sure is in Mexico, but I could be wrong on that.

278
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,080
Scott: They have a downhill BMX race, which is basically don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die.

279
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,883
Scott: And then you get to the end.

280
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:23,539
Scott: But it's in a city on this incredibly narrow course that's roped off with just sort of like streamers.

281
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:28,417
Scott: And you have to go like on ramps and jumps and stairs.

282
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:30,883
Scott: And it's rough.

283
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:37,140
Scott: Like you would die if you were in this race or at the very least you would keep hitting obstacles and stopping.

284
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,142
Rym: I might.

285
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:41,760
Rym: I mean, parts of it watching it, I could do, but not the whole thing.

286
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,360
Rym: I would do them slowly.

287
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:48,320
Scott: So this is yeah, this is actually a qualifying runs.

288
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:53,760
Scott: The guy doing this, you know, is all alone and he does the whole thing on his own without stopping pretty fast.

289
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:59,160
Scott: It's it's and you got a first person view with the helmet cam is pretty exciting, especially the stairs.

290
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,900
Scott: You're like, oh, oh, it's like if you were sitting on the seat going down the stairs, the pole, the bike seat would just shove right up your.

291
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:13,360
Rym: So very briefly, the meta moment we will be not this weekend, but next weekend at the Penny Arcade Expo doing five panels and three panel rooms.

292
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,417
Rym: The first one is Friday night.

293
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:22,400
Rym: We will also be at Zanko Con the following weekend, 18th, 19th and 20th of March in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

294
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:24,965
Rym: It's a rockin' anime con.

295
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:28,620
Rym: Our friends run it and we're actually doing mostly gaming panels.

296
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,462
Scott: Exciting.

297
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:31,620
Rym: We're doing brand new PAX panels, actually.

298
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:34,000
Scott: In April, there's going to be a mocha festival.

299
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:35,619
Scott: There's going to be an anime Boston.

300
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,638
Rym: We'll be at both of them.

301
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,019
Scott: Yeah, there's some New York technology stuff going on.

302
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:42,959
Scott: I forget exactly what the calendar.

303
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,120
Rym: That's a fantastic news there.

304
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:46,460
Scott: Yes, I forgot.

305
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:50,239
Rym: Scott, I believe what you just said is something's happening in New York.

306
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:51,739
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

307
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:52,956
Scott: Then I forget it's on my calendar.

308
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,840
Rym: The book club book is still Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

309
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,659
Rym: We were still waiting for Scott to finish reading it.

310
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,226
Scott: That's all right.

311
00:14:58,429 --> 00:14:59,079
Scott: Hasn't been that long.

312
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:03,400
Rym: And if you want gig nights merchandise, we haven't talked about this in a while.

313
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,520
Rym: Our old Soviet Union shirt is almost out.

314
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,060
Scott: So if you want one of those, nobody's ordered one in a while, I think because we stopped mentioning it.

315
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:13,760
Rym: Yeah, so we have our shirt in the e-commerce store.

316
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,080
Rym: Supplies are very fucking limited.

317
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,379
Scott: If you get one, then you can wear it to any of these upcoming conventions and we'll see you.

318
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:23,999
Rym: Yeah, we'll be like, hey, thanks for giving me some money.

319
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:30,980
Scott: Yeah, and then as soon as we sell these out, then we'll probably have a greater incentive to make more new stuff and also reprint the current shirt.

320
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,518
Rym: Yes, new stuff first, though, because if we say we'll reprint these once they sell out, there's no incentive to buy one.

321
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:41,380
Scott: Yeah, we'll only print them, you know, print new ones if there's a strong demand for them.

322
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,180
Scott: Maybe we'll do preorders for a second printing or something like that to see if people even want them.

323
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:46,452
Rym: Also, join our forum.

324
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,100
Rym: It's pretty rocking.

325
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:48,719
Rym: I don't think we need to say anymore.

326
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:54,360
Rym: So we heard about to get right into it because people have been asking for an episode on this for a while.

327
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:57,000
Scott: We heard about my little, but it just hasn't been a Wednesday.

328
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,980
Rym: Friendship is magic from a multitude of sources over the course of some weeks.

329
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,800
Scott: I mean, it started out when I saw some buzz on Twitter among some anime fans like Gerald and such.

330
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,121
Scott: Right.

331
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,660
Scott: And they were saying, hey, there is a new My Little Pony show.

332
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:11,068
Scott: It's actually good.

333
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:12,439
Scott: And I was like, oh, I'll make a note of that.

334
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:15,220
Scott: And I made a mental note like, oh, there's a new My Little Pony show.

335
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,603
Scott: It's good.

336
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:17,280
Rym: Scott was like, yeah, you see that tweet?

337
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,120
Rym: And I'm like, yeah, we should watch it at some point.

338
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,512
Rym: And then they say it's good.

339
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:21,439
Rym: Maybe we'll do a review.

340
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:21,822
Rym: Yeah.

341
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:24,100
Scott: And, you know, we just sort of I took a note and I put it aside.

342
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,932
Scott: And then I saw some other tweets and some other information that was like.

343
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:38,780
Scott: this show is made by Lauren Faust, who apparently Craig McCracken, who is a guy who worked at Cartoon Network on many shows like, I think he worked on Dexter's Lab and Samurai Jack and, you know, many other good Cartoon Network shows.

344
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:41,669
Scott: You know, he is the wife.

345
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,120
Scott: He's the husband of Lauren Faust.

346
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,163
Scott: Lauren Faust is the wife.

347
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:53,080
Scott: And she worked on Powerpuff Girls and also this other show that I never heard of called Something Imaginary Friends, according to Wikipedia, at least.

348
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:56,920
Rym: I also have an interest in Hasbro in general for various reasons.

349
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,620
Rym: So I knew that it was on their new network that they kind of launched with Discovery called The Hub.

350
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,360
Rym: And it's kind of one of the flagship products.

351
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,867
Scott: Well, My Little Pony is on the hub.

352
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,660
Scott: The shows I just mentioned were Cartoon Network shows.

353
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,659
Scott: Lauren Faust, you know, had a reputation for quality animation work.

354
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:11,521
Rym: Yeah.

355
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:12,244
Scott: So they came.

356
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:16,480
Scott: What happened is Hasbro bought half of Discovery Kids Network, which is, I guess, terrible.

357
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,827
Rym: Well, it's a joint venture to make this kind of.

358
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,489
Scott: they own.

359
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:22,880
Rym: they own half of their work designed to sell toys via animation.

360
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:25,060
Rym: They have a remake of like Pound Puppies.

361
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,319
Scott: They got a remake of Pound Puppies.

362
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,460
Scott: They got a Transformers show.

363
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,020
Scott: They got a whole bunch of stuff on this network.

364
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:37,060
Scott: And at night, they even have a show that they have a game shows that are themed after many board games like the Game of Life and shit.

365
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:43,820
Scott: And they got, you know, at night, it's sort of like a Nickelodeon format, like cartoons all day and like old TV shows all night.

366
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,400
Rym: But it's definitely like the original Nickelodeon 24/7 advertisement for their products.

367
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,204
Scott: Exactly.

368
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:52,440
Rym: There was actually some buzz against it.

369
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,439
Rym: Like we shouldn't let a TV company be run by a toy company for children, blah, blah, blah, blah.

370
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,060
Rym: But so we finally got around to it.

371
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,820
Rym: I got a torrent and YouTube and such.

372
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,459
Rym: And we watched the My Little Pony and it's all right.

373
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,443
Rym: It's OK.

374
00:18:06,094 --> 00:18:07,080
Rym: It's fucking awesome.

375
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,492
Scott: I mean, it's not like, OK, it's not.

376
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:10,519
Rym: it's no cowboy bebop.

377
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:13,480
Scott: No, I mean, it's not a cowboy bebop or an Evangelion.

378
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,040
Scott: It's not an artistic masterpiece.

379
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:15,662
Scott: Right.

380
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:16,427
Scott: But it has.

381
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,780
Scott: it has something special about it.

382
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:22,440
Scott: To where everyone basically can't stop discussing it.

383
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,218
Scott: They can't stop thinking about it.

384
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,792
Scott: You know, it's like.

385
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:26,318
Scott: it's like crack.

386
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:26,900
Scott: Right.

387
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:27,262
Scott: You can.

388
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:32,180
Scott: you watch it and there are certain parts of the show where you groan or you don't like certain characters.

389
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:34,020
Scott: You don't like certain episodes or scenes.

390
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:40,260
Scott: You know, it has a lot of flaws, but there's just something about it to where you just want to watch it all the time.

391
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:48,440
Rym: And everybody is crazy about it and arguing about it has spread through our large circle of listeners and friends like a virus.

392
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:51,040
Rym: I mean, we get Scott and I watched it and we got into it.

393
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,658
Rym: So we made other people watch it.

394
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,862
Rym: I think it culminated.

395
00:18:53,883 --> 00:19:01,480
Rym: we had a big party up in Albany with like our whole crew and a few of us, the ones who were in the know, were like, yeah, my little pony and the rest.

396
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,020
Rym: Everyone else like, what the fuck is wrong?

397
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:10,119
Scott: And at least 75 percent of all talking period was pony talking only among the people who knew.

398
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:12,819
Scott: And by the time we were done, everyone knew.

399
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,100
Scott: True.

400
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:16,760
Rym: But in the beginning, it was just us and certain other people who were talking about the ponies.

401
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:18,880
Rym: Everyone else is just like, Jesus, what's wrong with you guys?

402
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:20,460
Rym: Stop talking about the ponies.

403
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:22,660
Rym: And then we made them watch some ponies.

404
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:25,840
Rym: And with one exception, they were they were hooked.

405
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:28,040
Rym: Yeah, there's something to this show.

406
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:29,398
Rym: I really like it.

407
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,244
Scott: I don't know.

408
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:33,060
Scott: I have some theories, like some sort of subliminal.

409
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:40,480
Rym: That's Emily's theory that that there's some sort of subliminal message that between every frame there are boobies and explosions and guns.

410
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:41,307
Scott: It's possible.

411
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:42,139
Scott: Bam, bam, bam.

412
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:43,109
Scott: I think there might be.

413
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,100
Scott: We had to slow that shit down.

414
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,259
Rym: Alternate hypothesis.

415
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:46,539
Rym: Rainbow Dash.

416
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:49,943
Scott: Yeah.

417
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:52,213
Scott: So so his is the deal with this show, right, is?

418
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:54,020
Scott: I did some investigating.

419
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,420
Scott: Right.

420
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:58,780
Scott: Because, you know, we were earlier in this episode, we talked about Thundercats and He-Man and stuff like that.

421
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,400
Scott: And, you know, I liked He-Man when I was a kid.

422
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,560
Scott: But He-Man was terrible when I went back to watch it for recent years.

423
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,264
Scott: It's just awful.

424
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,860
Rym: And I did not watch My Little Pony as a kid.

425
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,520
Rym: I saw the movie in the theater.

426
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:12,820
Scott: I think I might have seen a movie in the theater, but it might have been a Care Bears movie.

427
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:14,660
Scott: And I don't remember at all.

428
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,360
Rym: But as a kid, I thought My Little Pony was stupid.

429
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,620
Scott: I thought it was stupid.

430
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,700
Scott: I mean, I saw I encountered some of the toys at girls houses and they were not exciting.

431
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,399
Scott: And I never saw the show on TV.

432
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:28,040
Scott: I just knew it existed because I saw commercials for it on TV when I was a kid.

433
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:28,525
Rym: Yup.

434
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:29,400
Rym: My Little Pony.

435
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,041
Scott: Yeah.

436
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,700
Scott: So I knew My Little Pony existed.

437
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,100
Scott: But now that I like My Little Pony, I researched and all the old My Little Ponies.

438
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,599
Scott: This is G4, by the way.

439
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,041
Scott: Right.

440
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:40,780
Scott: You know, they talk about Generation 4.

441
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,760
Scott: Well, they talk about it the same way with Transformers, right?

442
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,211
Scott: Except, you know, this Transformers G1, G2, G3.

443
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:51,420
Rym: Now I point out, the way nerds are talking about this show is very indicative of its mass appeal to nerds.

444
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:52,038
Scott: Oh, yes.

445
00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:00,880
Rym: I mean, people like us are using the lingo, kind of like how if Batman, the animated series, hadn't been great, like if it had been dumb, we would have called it the Batman cartoon.

446
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:01,443
Rym: Yeah.

447
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:02,720
Rym: But because it's good.

448
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:03,140
Scott: BTS.

449
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,662
Rym: Yeah.

450
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,539
Rym: It has an acronym, a canonical acronym among the fans.

451
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:06,920
Scott: Yeah.

452
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,500
Scott: So this is MLPFIM, which is an initialism, not an acronym.

453
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:12,297
Rym: Yes, it is.

454
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,576
Scott: Anyway, so...

455
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,656
Rym: But I said BTS.

456
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,200
Scott: Yeah.

457
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:19,538
Scott: So my research has determined that My Little Pony's G1 through 3 are awful.

458
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,920
Scott: And Generation 2 and 3 are actually kind of recent-ish.

459
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,540
Scott: Only one is really old, but they're all awful.

460
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,700
Scott: Like completely painful and awful.

461
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:37,659
Rym: And rebooting My Little Pony have been terrible because it was such just a saccharine, "Yay, little ponies, girls can brush their hair and oh my gosh...".

462
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:40,293
Rym: "Sell the toys, we don't care about making a good

463
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:40,916
Rym: show.".

464
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:45,420
Scott: But My Little Pony Generation 4, Friendship is Magic, is great.

465
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,700
Scott: And what's really scary is if you look on, for example, there's a GIF that's been going around.

466
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,079
Rym: Oh, the YouTube demographics?

467
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,380
Scott: Yeah, it shows the YouTube statistics for the episodes.

468
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,220
Scott: And it's like, you know, demographics watching this show.

469
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:05,480
Scott: This show, this video is most popular amongst girls, 13 through 17, men, 20 through 30, you know, 30, men, 30 through 40.

470
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,576
Scott: And it's like, what the fuck did they do?

471
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:16,720
Rym: So had it been older men, like one more generation up, you could have made the argument that it's parents with YouTube accounts showing it to their kids.

472
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,138
Scott: Possible.

473
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,620
Rym: But it is not that.

474
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,080
Rym: It is our generation.

475
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:25,000
Scott: If you go to any discussion forum that is related to anime, go to our forum.

476
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:26,579
Scott: How many pages is it now?

477
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:27,539
Scott: Oh my God.

478
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,420
Rym: There are like 700 posts in one of the My Little Pony threads in the GeekNights forum.

479
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,249
Scott: You go to 4chan, you go to 4chan.

480
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:44,380
Scott: had to like, there was a guy who went through and they had to have pony limiting rules added because there were too many ponies and people who, you know how the firefly people call themselves brown coats.

481
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,500
Scott: Apparently, if you like my little pony or a brony.

482
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,420
Scott: Yeah, at least if you're a dude, I don't know to the regular.

483
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,320
Scott: I mean, I don't know if you're a girl who likes middle pony bumps, whatever.

484
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:01,600
Rym: Also note that, you know, everything that gets popular among nerds has this kind of mash up fandom that happens.

485
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,039
Rym: But my little pony came to the table pretty quick with that one epic My Little Pony PMV.

486
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,247
Scott: Well, yeah, that was.

487
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:09,519
Scott: they even call it a PMV.

488
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,760
Scott: It's not an anime music video.

489
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,777
Scott: It's a pony music video.

490
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:12,800
Scott: Right.

491
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,800
Rym: It's like it's because the fandom is one of the best MVs I've ever seen.

492
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:19,516
Scott: It's a good MV.

493
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:19,951
Rym: Yeah.

494
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,660
Rym: Like it's up there with the old Kevin Caldwell.

495
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,153
Rym: Yeah.

496
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:28,999
Scott: And, you know, on top of this, right, you have Lauren Faust, the creator on DeviantArt, like actually talking to people about the show.

497
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,838
Scott: And of course, on DeviantArt, plenty of people are posting arts, too.

498
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,840
Scott: So the fandom for this is usploding.

499
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,540
Rym: Now, what's interesting is that I have been emailed.

500
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:46,440
Rym: I'll keep names out of this, but I have talked to representatives from several companies, both directly and indirectly related to My Little Pony.

501
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,619
Rym: Also, people who run certain conventions we may or may not attend.

502
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:57,940
Rym: And pretty much at one point, I emailed someone and said, hey, My Little Pony fandom will be surprisingly and scarily popular at your convention.

503
00:23:58,142 --> 00:24:00,479
Rym: I know you won't believe me and I know that sounds stupid, but trust me.

504
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,800
Rym: So and I had some suggestions for what they should do to take advantage of that.

505
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,460
Rym: The response was, oh, shit, yeah, My Little Pony.

506
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:13,420
Rym: The only people who don't seem to get it are the people in charge of Hasbro.

507
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,120
Rym: But I think all the production team of My Little Pony knows what's up.

508
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,099
Scott: Well, I don't know.

509
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,620
Scott: Well, obviously they do have to talk to people on DeviantArt, right?

510
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,389
Scott: But I wonder how much they do or do not know, because here's some evidence that is going around.

511
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,739
Scott: Here's some things I've seen.

512
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:30,400
Scott: Number one, they're not taking it off YouTube.

513
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,240
Scott: People are posting it on YouTube, full episodes.

514
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,960
Scott: They're not sending takedown notices.

515
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,126
Scott: At least they haven't yet to.

516
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:38,258
Scott: they post full episodes like the most recent.

517
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:40,780
Scott: three or four episodes are just available on the My Little Pony website.

518
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,386
Scott: No problem.

519
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:41,690
Scott: Free.

520
00:24:41,953 --> 00:24:42,480
Scott: Just watch them.

521
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,008
Scott: They don't care.

522
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:43,476
Scott: Right.

523
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,159
Rym: Honey Badger doesn't give a shit.

524
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:45,621
Scott: Right.

525
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:52,959
Scott: You know, in addition, like they you know, they're not so good at making toys, but they have put them out pretty quickly.

526
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,341
Rym: Yep.

527
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,120
Rym: Now, what's said, I got a link to the video.

528
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,520
Rym: I still haven't uploaded it, but the toys look pretty piss poor, to be honest.

529
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:01,120
Rym: And it bothers me that they're awful.

530
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,045
Rym: I'm used to it.

531
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:04,060
Scott: Couldn't even like they couldn't even keep the princess white.

532
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,099
Scott: They had to make the princess pink.

533
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,823
Scott: Look at anime.

534
00:25:05,863 --> 00:25:10,140
Rym: The crappiest PVC looks like the character, the crappiest one.

535
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,379
Rym: The one you get in a little ball from a gachapon machine looks better than what the Hasbro toys look like.

536
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:23,040
Rym: But our friend Natalie bought all the toys and just by doing their hair actually made them look ninety nine percent awesome.

537
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:23,769
Scott: All right.

538
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:24,319
Scott: How about that?

539
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:24,682
Scott: Yeah.

540
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:25,971
Rym: But I feel.

541
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:27,320
Rym: but then again, think of it this way.

542
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:29,020
Rym: They probably didn't expect.

543
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,563
Rym: Here's my guess.

544
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,679
Rym: They did not expect this to happen at all.

545
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:35,179
Rym: So they made the show aimed at kids and the people doing the show.

546
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,144
Rym: You know, Lauren files.

547
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:39,300
Rym: They decided that, all right, we're given this property.

548
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:40,619
Rym: We have to do something with it.

549
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:42,600
Rym: Let's make it as awesome as we can.

550
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,403
Rym: God damn make it.

551
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:47,860
Rym: So as a result, because they're good people, it was awesome.

552
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:50,680
Rym: And it has this appeal that Hasbro did not anticipate.

553
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:57,640
Rym: And I would hazard that they're leaving the YouTube videos and all this Internet stuff untouched because they're not sure how to take advantage of it.

554
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,179
Scott: Well, because I mean, they're going to quash it.

555
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,043
Scott: They're smart.

556
00:26:00,846 --> 00:26:05,078
Scott: You know, they should realize that their goal is to sell toys and they should make better toys.

557
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:05,924
Scott: Oh, no.

558
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:06,992
Scott: Here's the show to be free.

559
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,120
Rym: You didn't let me finish.

560
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:17,660
Rym: I think the reason the toys are pretty weak is that it's a long time from we should make a toy to a physical toys in stores everywhere.

561
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:31,000
Rym: I'm pretty sure these toys were long in a pipeline and they came out and it was far too late to do something different by the time they realized that people like me are watching My Little Pony, probably more so than eight year old girls.

562
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,641
Scott: You know what?

563
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:32,868
Scott: You know, there is.

564
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:36,960
Scott: there has been talk that there are some sort of executive pressures on the show.

565
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,261
Scott: Right.

566
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:39,300
Scott: She doesn't there isn't like this full creative control.

567
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,180
Scott: For example, the princess was supposed to be the queen, but they call her the princess.

568
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:43,782
Scott: Why?

569
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:48,106
Scott: Well, because, you know, Disney has made it so the princesses are good and queen are bad.

570
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:49,179
Scott: So you don't want to call her the queen.

571
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,040
Rym: As a result, it's the principality of Equestria, as far as we can tell, unless maybe it is a kingdom and there's a regency.

572
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:55,967
Scott: We don't know.

573
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:56,635
Rym: We don't know.

574
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,839
Scott: But you also get it going down that road.

575
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,521
Scott: Right.

576
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:11,740
Scott: You know, this show, one of the main reasons that I think it has, you know, so much interest from the nerds is that, you know, on the surface, right, there's sort of like, you know, this painful kind of stuff.

577
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:18,820
Scott: A lot of the things in the episodes are just sort of, you know, girly and sort of like, you know, like, oh, she's making dresses for everyone.

578
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,782
Rym: Oh, no.

579
00:27:19,862 --> 00:27:25,522
Scott: And then at the end of the episode, it's like the like writes a letter to the princess.

580
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:29,880
Scott: That's like incredibly non-subtle moral lesson for children.

581
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,720
Rym: Today, I learned that racism is not a good idea.

582
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:34,780
Scott: Yeah, it's like, oh, really?

583
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:38,220
Scott: It's kind of painful for someone who's almost 30 years old to watch that.

584
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:46,660
Scott: But beneath the surface, just lurking there is like this mythology that is being built in an extremely nerdy way.

585
00:27:47,621 --> 00:28:00,719
Rym: The show, we're calling this now, we've coined a term, it's Gandalf's girths, because we way back, we went to see Inception and me and Scott and a bunch of our friends were arguing about what actually happened at the end.

586
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:04,580
Rym: And at one point, Scott says something along the lines of, this is stupid.

587
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:07,020
Rym: This is like arguing how long Gandalf's dick is.

588
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,017
Rym: There's just no way to know.

589
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:11,980
Rym: And I immediately put forth that, no, his dick is seven inches long.

590
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:17,140
Rym: And we realized that nerds love to talk about Gandalf's dick.

591
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:17,821
Scott: Yeah.

592
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:26,751
Scott: I mean, basically, when you have a world of fiction, right, there's going to be things, you know, when the world is being built, when there is, you know, a Forgotten Realms or any sort of any sort of world

593
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:27,715
Rym: building correctly,

594
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,240
Scott: any sort of world building, there's going to be things that you know about the world.

595
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:32,145
Scott: Right.

596
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:33,459
Scott: Baldur's Gate is here.

597
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:37,760
Scott: And, you know, look at the expanded Star Wars universe, this old and this many levels.

598
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,920
Rym: I mean, it's got income, I think, made the X-Wing.

599
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:40,809
Rym: Yeah, right.

600
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:41,619
Rym: Not in the movies.

601
00:28:41,841 --> 00:28:42,082
Rym: Nope.

602
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:45,120
Scott: But there are certain things you do not know.

603
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,540
Scott: Right.

604
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:55,400
Scott: Like how many, you know, as long as Gandalf, how many horsepower does a speeder bike have on Endor after it gets broken a little bit?

605
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:03,760
Rym: You know, nerds will take that question and say, all right, well, if we see it in episode six, it's moving, you know, at this rate relative to the trees.

606
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,203
Rym: So it's good.

607
00:29:04,223 --> 00:29:06,260
Scott: But then if you pull the thing down, it goes even faster.

608
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,579
Scott: Isn't this a higher speed that they don't use?

609
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,540
Scott: And then they, you know, he pulls on the throttle.

610
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,168
Rym: Look, the one stormtrooper that was knocked off of and hit the tree, he hit hard enough to crack his helmet.

611
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,259
Rym: So how strong are the helmets?

612
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:18,842
Scott: Right.

613
00:29:18,902 --> 00:29:20,420
Scott: You know, that kind of argument.

614
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,100
Scott: That's Gandalf's dick, right?

615
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,680
Scott: Because nowhere in the Lord of the Rings does it talk about Gandalf's dick.

616
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,813
Scott: It doesn't even say he has a dick.

617
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:26,299
Scott: He doesn't pee.

618
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:28,040
Scott: But he's a man.

619
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,940
Scott: He must have one.

620
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:32,120
Rym: So how long is it that it is seven inches long?

621
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,820
Rym: Because that is a solid length that is not excessive.

622
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,720
Rym: It's not crazy.

623
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,771
Rym: It's not like 40 feet.

624
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,880
Rym: You shall not pass.

625
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:46,760
Rym: But he wouldn't have a tiny one or even an average one.

626
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,059
Scott: Kidney stone, you shall not pass.

627
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,340
Rym: He's Gandalf.

628
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,040
Rym: He's not going to make it tiny.

629
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,819
Rym: So seven inches is kind of be like like the muscle car.

630
00:29:59,003 --> 00:30:00,272
Rym: Yeah.

631
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:01,380
Scott: But anyway, so, yeah.

632
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,600
Scott: My Little Pony Friendship is Magic is loaded with Gandalf's girth questions, right?

633
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,460
Scott: Like, for example, the old palace is in the Everfree Forest.

634
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:10,805
Rym: Yeah.

635
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:11,259
Rym: What's the deal?

636
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,860
Scott: What's the deal with the Everfree Forest?

637
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,180
Scott: How come the ponies manage all the weather?

638
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,759
Scott: The princess has to make the sun go up and down.

639
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:22,780
Scott: But the place of the Everfree Forest is the clouds and the weather move on their own.

640
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,380
Scott: And the animals are wild animals.

641
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:34,419
Scott: But the animals who live in Equestria outside of the Everfree Forest, they have to wake the animals up from hibernation and feed them and take care of them because the animals can't manage themselves.

642
00:30:34,703 --> 00:30:36,220
Scott: They're all domesticated.

643
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,300
Rym: I mean, look at the society.

644
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,300
Rym: There are clearly different like Twilight Sparkle is clearly of the nobility.

645
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,900
Rym: I mean, she lived in a lot and she moves to this kind of backwater town with all these kind of provincial people.

646
00:30:47,525 --> 00:30:48,480
Rym: And yet she has magic.

647
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,180
Rym: She's a unicorn and unicorns and Pegasus and earth ponies all have different things.

648
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,000
Rym: But during the winter wrap up, they weren't allowed to use magic.

649
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,640
Rym: It's their old earth pony tradition.

650
00:30:57,181 --> 00:31:01,840
Rym: I get this sense that the earth ponies were there maybe before Equestria.

651
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:05,520
Scott: Yeah, well, no, the earth ponies founded Ponyville a hundred years ago.

652
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,120
Scott: It said so Equestria is at least a thousand years old because that is how.

653
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:11,679
Scott: So we can already see the direction this is going in.

654
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,920
Scott: It's totally this crazy fantasy world.

655
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,680
Scott: And if you are a nerd, they drop these tidbits of information all over the place.

656
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,619
Scott: And little girls, I don't know if they notice it or not.

657
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,177
Scott: I hope they do.

658
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,619
Rym: But nerds notice immediately that Fluttershy is one year older than Pinkie Pie.

659
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,319
Scott: That's right.

660
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:28,220
Scott: They also are like, so where does Pinkie Pie live?

661
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,580
Scott: Oh, she lives in an apartment above the cakes bakery.

662
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,497
Scott: And she works for Mr.

663
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,001
Scott: and Mrs.

664
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:37,339
Scott: Cake baking, you know, and where Rainbow Dash lives in the little cloud palace she made for herself.

665
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:42,799
Rym: And only Pegasus ponies can stand on the clouds, which matters in the episode when they go to Cloudsdale.

666
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,400
Rym: Yeah.

667
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:47,080
Scott: You know, it's actually, you know, incredibly consistent.

668
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:49,620
Scott: There are some inconsistencies, but they are few.

669
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:54,580
Rym: And we have noticed all of that, like the carrot tops head was green in one episode.

670
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,180
Scott: It's like, did she just dyed her hair or there's another carrot girl?

671
00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:59,140
Scott: But no, Cutie Mark makes you unique.

672
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,740
Scott: So there's not two people with the same Cutie Mark.

673
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:03,626
Rym: There's also.

674
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:06,759
Rym: some people have one Cutie Mark of like one symbol and some have three.

675
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,560
Rym: And it seems like there's different power.

676
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,160
Scott: I think the Derpy Hoops has like five bubbles or something like that.

677
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:12,740
Scott: I don't know.

678
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:13,639
Scott: Or seven bubbles.

679
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,200
Rym: Derpy Hoops.

680
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,247
Rym: But there's some weird ones like.

681
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:16,960
Rym: Twilight Sparkles is kind of different, too.

682
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,018
Rym: There's a bunch of stuff going on.

683
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,778
Scott: Well, Twilight Sparkles is in the same style as so.

684
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,599
Scott: So, yeah, the princess Luna.

685
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,539
Scott: No, the princess Luna has the moon.

686
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:24,917
Rym: Right.

687
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:28,319
Scott: And then Princess Celestia has the sun.

688
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:32,440
Rym: Now, Twilight Sparkles is a Pegasus unicorn pony.

689
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:33,099
Scott: That's right.

690
00:32:33,362 --> 00:32:33,899
Scott: She's a Pegacorn.

691
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:37,100
Scott: No, the two princesses are Pegacorns.

692
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,420
Scott: But every other pony is either an earth pony, a Pegasus or a unicorn.

693
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:50,220
Rym: Now, I wonder, I mean, it's almost like if you look at this, like look at the Prince of Nothing with the non-men or something, maybe there's like they're likened unto the gods, the two princesses maybe descended from the gods.

694
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:54,040
Rym: And there were earth ponies that were already there because earth ponies have their shtick.

695
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,319
Rym: I mean, they're skilled or whatever.

696
00:32:55,922 --> 00:33:03,419
Rym: I feel like through interbreeding over the years, if you have royal blood, you get either wings or horns, but for some reason, not both.

697
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:04,580
Scott: Yep.

698
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,860
Scott: There's a whole bunch of stuff like that.

699
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,440
Scott: But another another thing related to that right is, remember, this is made by Hasbro, right?

700
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,120
Scott: Hasbro owns My Little Pony.

701
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:14,040
Scott: They own Transformers.

702
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:16,319
Scott: They own a lot of other nerdery things like that.

703
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:16,940
Rym: But let's see.

704
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,900
Rym: Let's see if they can guess the other thing they own.

705
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:24,018
Rym: Let's see if they can guess what has appeared in the show so far other than ponies.

706
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:29,496
Scott: Well, you know, plenty of things, but cockatrice, manticore, dragon, dragon.

707
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,760
Rym: Who owns Dungeons and Dragons?

708
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,413
Scott: Yeah, OK.

709
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,300
Scott: They own Wizards.

710
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,380
Scott: Hasbro owns Wizards of the Coast, which owns Magic the Gathering and also Dungeons and Dragons.

711
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:49,600
Scott: I do not think it is a coincidence that you are seeing, you know, sea serpents, hydras, griffins and all these sorts of fantasy monsters right appear.

712
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,600
Scott: I mean, manticore, specifically cockatrice, specifically in this show for little girls.

713
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,819
Rym: I will bet the chimera is the next one.

714
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,580
Scott: A chimera is a very likely pick for something to appear.

715
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,359
Rym: I did like how the hydra had one kind of dumb head.

716
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:06,900
Scott: It's a hydra.

717
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:07,640
Scott: That's how it works.

718
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,398
Rym: They always have one dumb head.

719
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:09,829
Rym: Yeah.

720
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:17,359
Scott: You know, I mean, most of the inconsistencies in the show are like, how come she didn't use her teleporting magic right there?

721
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:19,960
Rym: But there are good arguments to be made as to why she doesn't.

722
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,020
Rym: I mean, it clearly takes a lot of effort and she has trouble with it.

723
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,859
Rym: And remember, when she teleported under duress that one time with Spike, she burned him.

724
00:34:28,324 --> 00:34:28,938
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

725
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:31,420
Scott: But anyway, yeah.

726
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,498
Scott: So this show has a new episode every Friday, and it's strange that the episodes air at one thirty and ten thirty.

727
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,699
Scott: Not that I'm watching it on TV.

728
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:39,639
Rym: I'm watching it on YouTube.

729
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:40,679
Rym: One thirty.

730
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,947
Scott: Who's watching the show?

731
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:43,600
Scott: at one thirty or ten thirty?

732
00:34:43,741 --> 00:34:50,659
Rym: Never in my life have I been home from school at any point from kindergarten through my senior year of high school by one thirty.

733
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:51,580
Scott: Yeah, right.

734
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:51,911
Rym: Ever.

735
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,620
Rym: Now, maybe it's the DVR generation.

736
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:59,599
Rym: Maybe they expect parents to DVR it before the kids get home and they show it to the kids as soon as they get home.

737
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:00,077
Scott: I don't know.

738
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,840
Scott: Maybe they just expect people to watch it on YouTube because they want to give the good time spot to the Transformers.

739
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,700
Rym: But then why the nine o'clock at night?

740
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,999
Scott: Nobody's talking about the Transformers show at all.

741
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:11,580
Rym: Or the pound puppies.

742
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,559
Scott: Oh, good God.

743
00:35:12,965 --> 00:35:14,020
Scott: It doesn't look good at all.

744
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,690
Scott: I haven't watched it, but it doesn't look.

745
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,800
Scott: it's not a my guarantee.

746
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,544
Scott: It's not a my little.

747
00:35:17,906 --> 00:35:20,100
Rym: I did like my pound puppies as a kid, though.

748
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,279
Rym: We'll see if I don't know if it's actually good.

749
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:23,377
Scott: You should try it out.

750
00:35:24,025 --> 00:35:24,778
Scott: Go back and watch them.

751
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,297
Rym: Maybe.

752
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,460
Rym: So, Scott, I have a really tough question for you.

753
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,060
Rym: Who is your favorite non rainbow dash pony?

754
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,799
Scott: A non rainbow dash pony?

755
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,180
Scott: Yeah, probably Twilight Sparkle because she is sciency and she is not crazy.

756
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,300
Rym: She's pretty level headed.

757
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,380
Scott: All the other ones are totally crazy in some way.

758
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:43,380
Rym: Big Macintosh.

759
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,477
Scott: Big Macintosh is cool, but I mean, he doesn't have enough screen time to be like a favorite or anything.

760
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:51,420
Rym: Yeah, I'm actually kind of warm into rarity, though.

761
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:59,240
Scott: Well, I mean, I'm warming on rarity, but I mean, she was so far down that a slight warming does not bring her up to above anybody.

762
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:03,080
Scott: Maybe she's above like, you know, Cutie Mark Crusaders.

763
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:03,737
Scott: That's about it.

764
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:04,860
Rym: I don't mind.

765
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:06,720
Rym: I don't know why you hate the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

766
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,480
Scott: They're just annoying.

767
00:36:07,962 --> 00:36:09,880
Rym: The CMC is not that annoying.

768
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,780
Rym: It's pretty annoying.

769
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:12,180
Scott: They're just whiny little kids.

770
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,959
Rym: Only be annoying if they get too many episodes.

771
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,979
Scott: They've already got another episode coming next week.

772
00:36:18,283 --> 00:36:18,798
Scott: This week.

773
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:25,400
Rym: I also think they could be saved if we have an episode where Rainbow Dash is taking care of them because she would not take care of them for shit.

774
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,279
Scott: Well, she tried to help out.

775
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:35,999
Scott: There was the pre Cutie Mark Crusader Apple Bloom episode where Rainbow Dash is trying to give her all sorts of training, trying to help her get her period as fast as possible.

776
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,077
Scott: Yeah, didn't work.

777
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:40,939
Rym: I there's the show also.

778
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,500
Rym: It's funny.

779
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,580
Rym: It has moments that are funny no matter what age you are.

780
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,960
Scott: Yeah, it's like even if the plot of a particular episode is painful, it has legitimate comedy, usually coming from Pinkie Pie's department.

781
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,640
Rym: Pinkie Pie is the only pony who makes me laugh out loud contextually.

782
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:56,980
Scott: Yeah, she's supposed to.

783
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,399
Scott: It's intentional funny jokes.

784
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,580
Rym: But when they all got herpes and Twilight Sparkle had her and I didn't even do this.

785
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:05,177
Rym: This was Emily.

786
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:09,660
Rym: We were watching and she's there and her horns all limp and covered in pustules.

787
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,819
Rym: She's like, oh, my God, my horn.

788
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:14,320
Rym: And she's talking to Spike and it's kind of waggling around in his face.

789
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:23,680
Rym: And she cracked up long before I did at the obvious phallic reference that could be made to the floppy herpes infected horn on Twilight Sparkle's head.

790
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:25,479
Scott: I mean, it's a unicorn horn, right?

791
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:31,420
Scott: A lot of people say unicorn horns are originally a phallic thing, but not at least they are.

792
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,440
Scott: They aren't in the show, but you can make anything into a phallic thing.

793
00:37:34,742 --> 00:37:37,180
Rym: But note how the fans are also obsessing over.

794
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:47,639
Rym: I mean, on the wiki, people have identified every single motherfucking pony that has been shown at any amount of time for any amount of time in the entire show.

795
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,859
Rym: Yeah, it's like she's for ponies that are in the background once.

796
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:53,280
Scott: You know, because think about you're making the show, right?

797
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,440
Scott: It's made in flash.

798
00:37:54,881 --> 00:38:00,020
Scott: So what they do is they just like, OK, we need to have a background with a whole bunch of ponies in it because it's like the town hall meeting.

799
00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:00,858
Scott: So what do they do?

800
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,679
Scott: They just make a whole bunch of ponies.

801
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:06,120
Scott: They color them all different and give them just a randomly generated cutie marks.

802
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,720
Scott: Like someone just sat there during like 30 cutie marks and slapped them on.

803
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:17,620
Rym: Yeah, but now because fans pay attention, notice how they are using the same like core set of side characters, almost Simpsons style all the time in the background.

804
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,140
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, Derpy Hooves, they you know, there was the one they accidentally had her give her derp eyes.

805
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:28,219
Scott: So now she keeps reappearing with derp eyes and, you know, and at the same time, you've got like the guy with the hourglass on his ass.

806
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:28,582
Rym: Dr.

807
00:38:28,603 --> 00:38:28,918
Rym: Hooves.

808
00:38:29,605 --> 00:38:29,708
Scott: Dr.

809
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:30,099
Scott: Hooves.

810
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:34,880
Scott: You know, you've got who else is appearing frequently?

811
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:35,920
Rym: Carrot Top.

812
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,100
Scott: Yeah, the carrot pony.

813
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,720
Rym: Everyone likes the carrot pony.

814
00:38:38,961 --> 00:38:39,500
Scott: I like the carrot pony.

815
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,379
Rym: I like the carrot pony, too.

816
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:46,273
Rym: I actually really like Cheerilee, the teacher, just because she shows that picture of herself from the 90s.

817
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,356
Scott: It's totally 80s.

818
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:49,480
Rym: Like late 80s, early 90s fashion.

819
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,779
Scott: Yeah, it's it's a good one.

820
00:38:52,661 --> 00:39:00,439
Scott: Oh, there's also, you know, it's like, take for example, right, the episode where, you know, the episode where she makes all the dresses.

821
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:00,629
Scott: Yeah.

822
00:39:00,962 --> 00:39:01,070
Rym: Right.

823
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,060
Scott: And it's like, OK, you know, the episode itself, you know, had the painful parts.

824
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,120
Scott: Like I didn't like the singing.

825
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,260
Rym: I like the singing.

826
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:09,299
Scott: I do not like the songs in the show.

827
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,680
Rym: I actually really like the songs.

828
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,919
Rym: The Winter Wrap Up song has been stuck in my head for weeks.

829
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,436
Scott: Winter Wrap Up song is probably the best song, but that's not saying.

830
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:17,280
Scott: that's not saying much.

831
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:18,639
Scott: That's like saying the least smelly poop.

832
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,339
Rym: I like Pinkie Pie songs.

833
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:22,894
Scott: I mean, some of them are funny, but they're not.

834
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:23,580
Scott: they're not songs.

835
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:27,600
Rym: I even like the Grand Galloping Gala one because it's just so spastic.

836
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,760
Rym: She's just kind of hopping around.

837
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:29,736
Rym: I enjoy it.

838
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:31,199
Rym: But I like Rarity's song, too.

839
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:31,878
Rym: I thought it was good.

840
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:34,600
Scott: Like half the episode is her singing the song twice.

841
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:35,155
Rym: It wasn't.

842
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,760
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't half the episode.

843
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,480
Scott: It was a great significant portion of the episode was her singing the song two times.

844
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,379
Rym: Besides, that episode was about tribes, too.

845
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:43,280
Scott: Well, that's what I'm saying.

846
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,180
Scott: That episode.

847
00:39:44,712 --> 00:39:44,838
Scott: Right.

848
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:50,740
Scott: On the one hand was, you know, you know, on the surface level was just sort of like, all right.

849
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:56,519
Scott: But the message, you know, that an adult would get watching that show is like this twofold message.

850
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,180
Scott: On the one hand, you got the tribes to message, which is let the designer do what they do.

851
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,280
Scott: They know what's best.

852
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:05,296
Scott: If you listen to the community, you're just going to ruin your game.

853
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:05,859
Scott: tribes, too.

854
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:16,859
Scott: And also, if you're hiring a freelance designer, don't just, you know, it's basically you could tell that, you know, someone who had, you know, freelance design experience had written this episode.

855
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:25,058
Rym: Emily had a lot to say about that episode after we watched it, especially because we had moments in the past where she will show me a character design for something she's working on.

856
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:27,220
Rym: And she will say, how does it look?

857
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,720
Rym: And I'll say something like, I don't know, make it like 20 percent cooler.

858
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,358
Rym: I don't know.

859
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,960
Scott: Just needs to be cooler.

860
00:40:35,782 --> 00:40:39,380
Scott: And it's like that is how non artists, you know, critique art.

861
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,498
Scott: It's like they don't know what's good, you know, and Fluttershy gets mad points for her rant, too.

862
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,640
Scott: Well, at least Fluttershy had some knowledge about sewing.

863
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:50,360
Rym: Yeah, but her dress was still awful.

864
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,019
Scott: Yeah, it was still awful.

865
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,157
Scott: But I guess it was well made.

866
00:40:55,924 --> 00:40:56,467
Rym: And there's a lot.

867
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,920
Rym: I love the show for a lot of reasons.

868
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:04,720
Rym: But some of my favorite moments are surprisingly not the unintentional humors, like in the Zecora episode with the zebra.

869
00:41:05,322 --> 00:41:08,918
Rym: I really like the intentional humor when Pinkie Pie tries to sing her song and she can't.

870
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:10,498
Rym: And she gets Fluttershy to do it.

871
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:19,179
Rym: But I also like the unintentional humor of the fact that Rarity is racist and does not become terribly disabused of her racism by the end.

872
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:20,258
Scott: No, not really.

873
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,040
Rym: I mean, she's like, oh, she's covered in stripes.

874
00:41:23,323 --> 00:41:23,898
Rym: How awful.

875
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:27,700
Rym: And Twilight Sparkle's like, you realize that she was born that way.

876
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:29,376
Scott: And she's like, oh, my.

877
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:32,600
Rym: But yeah, he was born Japanese.

878
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:44,160
Scott: Yeah, I guess the other thing that I really like about the show, right, is that the animation quality is like the production quality as a whole.

879
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:51,420
Scott: Like I might not like the songs, but the singing is actually good and the voice acting is really good, which is really weird because a lot of the voice actors were also bad anime dub.

880
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,679
Rym: This is why I want to interview them, because I have a theory now.

881
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:55,420
Scott: All right.

882
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,640
Rym: No, none of these voice actors were in any way bad voice actors.

883
00:42:00,162 --> 00:42:02,440
Rym: They were poorly directed and given shit scripts.

884
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,940
Scott: Also, maybe I have an additional hypothesis.

885
00:42:06,461 --> 00:42:08,359
Scott: When they were doing the anime, they just didn't give a shit.

886
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:09,140
Rym: Maybe.

887
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,200
Scott: But when you see because it wasn't their character.

888
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:11,519
Scott: Right.

889
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,780
Scott: But now this is their character.

890
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:13,384
Scott: It's like they.

891
00:42:13,445 --> 00:42:15,180
Scott: whoever it is is Rainbow Dash.

892
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,060
Scott: So they're going to own that.

893
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,380
Rym: It's hard to say, though, because like Lisa Ortiz fucking owned Lisa.

894
00:42:20,232 --> 00:42:21,700
Rym: She fucking owned Lena inverse.

895
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Rym: Yeah, like that was her character.

896
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,659
Rym: She loved that as far as I could tell.

897
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,939
Rym: And I don't think it.

898
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:41,478
Rym: I think that it's just going to come down to the fact that the production values and the direction in anime dubs is probably pretty poor because this day you play any anime dub other than Cowboy Bebop in another room and ask someone to tell you if it's an anime dub or not.

899
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:41,984
Rym: 100% accuracy.

900
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:43,298
Scott: Yeah.

901
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,320
Rym: But My Little Pony sounds like people talking.

902
00:42:46,682 --> 00:42:47,540
Scott: Yeah, it sounds great.

903
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:51,460
Scott: And, you know, the animation it's done with Flash and it's really, really good.

904
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:57,479
Scott: And the thing that I find being the most funny in the show aren't so aren't even the intentional jokes while those are good.

905
00:42:57,912 --> 00:42:58,140
Scott: Right.

906
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:08,740
Scott: It's usually I find myself most entertained by just very quick, you know, very short moments of a facial expression here or a quip there.

907
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:14,839
Scott: Just like it's like a whole bunch of really small things, but they're happening constantly and they're all like terrific.

908
00:43:14,981 --> 00:43:15,560
Scott: You know what's funny?

909
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:19,119
Rym: You know, we said the same thing about just to make a point here.

910
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,338
Rym: Mahout Skytie.

911
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,600
Rym: That there were that the visual gags were very well executed.

912
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:35,017
Rym: The animation was very high quality and that the gags and the one offs and the snarks and the facial expressions were being done constantly, even in the background, which My Little Pony also does.

913
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,939
Scott: Well, I mean, the example that always comes to my mind is mostly, you know, Rainbow Dash because she's the best.

914
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:40,677
Scott: She is the best.

915
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,300
Scott: But it's like, OK, so when they end in the Sonic Rainboom episode where they pick her up at the end and she's like, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

916
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,180
Scott: After she wins the contest and gets the little Greek feathery crown.

917
00:43:51,405 --> 00:43:51,576
Scott: Right.

918
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:56,459
Scott: The way she sort of wiggles is just like it's like eye candy the way she's wiggling there, like, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

919
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,300
Scott: And then there's also the time where she kicks the dragon in the face.

920
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:00,645
Scott: Yeah.

921
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:04,280
Scott: And the dragon's like the Rainbow One kicked me.

922
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,500
Scott: And then she just sort of smiles and nods.

923
00:44:06,622 --> 00:44:07,557
Scott: And it's like, hells yeah.

924
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:10,620
Scott: Like the way she smiles and nods.

925
00:44:10,701 --> 00:44:12,700
Scott: It's like a fraction of a second of animation.

926
00:44:13,143 --> 00:44:13,647
Scott: But it's just.

927
00:44:13,728 --> 00:44:15,200
Scott: it's just like so fun to look at.

928
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,700
Rym: Well, Rainbow Dash edges toward the Internet face very often.

929
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,212
Scott: I mean, how are you mad?

930
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:21,291
Scott: Yeah.

931
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:32,400
Scott: A lot of the times, you know, it's like Rainbow Dash is the best because when, for example, when they're fighting over the grand galloping gala tickets, everyone's like, OK, you know, you can have my ticket.

932
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:33,158
Scott: I don't want to go.

933
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:37,500
Scott: If it's going to cause you so much trouble and everyone's like, all right, I'm giving up my ticket except for Rainbow Dash.

934
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,737
Scott: She's like, I got the day.

935
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,180
Scott: Yeah, it's mine now.

936
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,540
Scott: And then she's like, oh, all right.

937
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:44,600
Rym: There's a little bit of bender in Rainbow Dash.

938
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,879
Scott: Yeah, the benderness.

939
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,659
Rym: But Rarity has a lot of moments like that, too.

940
00:44:47,800 --> 00:45:01,920
Rym: She has this face she makes when she's a guest at something where her eyes get really small like, oh, oh, or when they're having the sleepover and Applejack's dares her to go outside in the rain and ruin her hair.

941
00:45:02,421 --> 00:45:09,635
Rym: And she just walks out and she's like, oh, oh, oh, the sea serpent, my moustache.

942
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:17,960
Rym: I note that the men in the show all have fascinations with moustaches.

943
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,040
Rym: The one sea serpent is fabulous.

944
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,756
Rym: Moustache like Spike really wants one snips and snails.

945
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,419
Scott: They liked it.

946
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,438
Rym: They like their moustache.

947
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:26,837
Scott: Yeah.

948
00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:33,540
Scott: The only thing about this show that has me slightly, you know, scared is the fact that, right?

949
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,191
Scott: When was the last time any show like this was?

950
00:45:36,432 --> 00:45:38,179
Scott: was capturing people to run to watch?

951
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,613
Scott: the next episode immediately was years ago, like 04, 03, perhaps.

952
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,959
Scott: I don't remember exactly the Full Metal Alchemist.

953
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,720
Rym: That was the last show that I was like, oh, shit, next episode.

954
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,357
Rym: Got to watch.

955
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:49,999
Scott: But where's Full Metal Alchemist now?

956
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,007
Scott: Yeah.

957
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,160
Scott: However, is My Little Pony the next Full Metal Alchemist or does it have the staying power?

958
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,520
Rym: However, I have counterexamples.

959
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,980
Scott: Or is it a flash in the pan?

960
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,280
Scott: A bright flash in the pan, but a flash nonetheless.

961
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:07,640
Rym: When I was in high school, I watched, for example, Escaflowne and El Hazard.

962
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:14,666
Rym: And Lane and all these anime and one VHS tape would come out every month that had four episodes on it.

963
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,696
Rym: And you can bet that we would go to the store the day it came out, buy it, immediately run home and watch it.

964
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:22,118
Rym: Those shows hold up.

965
00:46:22,683 --> 00:46:22,934
Scott: They do.

966
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,280
Rym: Also, I really think that Lauren Faust knows the deal and she definitely knows the deal.

967
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,579
Rym: if no one else, unless Hasbro cocks it up, she will be able to maintain this show.

968
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:36,179
Rym: And it's got a full twenty six.

969
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,720
Scott: It has twenty six episodes.

970
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:40,160
Scott: And, you know, it could be renewed forever.

971
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:40,497
Scott: Right.

972
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,039
Scott: It's possible.

973
00:46:41,328 --> 00:46:41,540
Scott: Right.

974
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,139
Scott: I mean, I don't really know if it isn't.

975
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:44,877
Scott: It's like, all right.

976
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:45,500
Rym: You know what?

977
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,420
Scott: If it was plenty of shows out there to watch.

978
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,020
Rym: But if it wasn't, I would.

979
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,918
Rym: This is the kind of thing I would try to invest in to make happen again, because I think it could make a lot of money.

980
00:46:54,782 --> 00:46:55,598
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

981
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,940
Scott: They just we'll see.

982
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:04,280
Rym: I mean, what they need to do is, for example, if they sold Rainbow Dash T-shirts in like Hot Topic, those would sell like hot cakes.

983
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,319
Scott: Probably.

984
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:06,891
Scott: Yeah.

985
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,600
Rym: I would buy one Rainbow Dash T-shirt if it was high quality.

986
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,577
Rym: It'd have to be the same level of quality, though, as my shirt.

987
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:14,853
Scott: Yeah.

988
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:16,379
Rym: Like that kind of styling.

989
00:47:17,242 --> 00:47:19,660
Scott: Is there anything else to say about My Little Pony?

990
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,900
Rym: Other than Gandalf Gerthing.

991
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,820
Rym: I have a lot of Gandalf Gerthing.

992
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,060
Scott: Yeah.

993
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,316
Scott: I mean, it's basically it's a show that has a target audience of little girls.

994
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:27,459
Scott: that somehow magic.

995
00:47:27,584 --> 00:47:27,879
Scott: Right.

996
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,843
Scott: But, you know, they didn't.

997
00:47:28,884 --> 00:47:34,558
Scott: they tried to avoid being a stereotypical bad show, like one good example, Hasbro has a result.

998
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,900
Rym: Guys like Hasbro had one victim.

999
00:47:37,362 --> 00:47:39,900
Rym: They're like, all right, we need to have a fashion pony.

1000
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,439
Rym: We need to have a fashion element so we can do whatever marketing we're going to do.

1001
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,139
Rym: So what did the studio do?

1002
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:46,320
Rym: They made Rarity.

1003
00:47:46,441 --> 00:47:48,280
Rym: She's not an air headed shopper girl.

1004
00:47:48,601 --> 00:47:53,220
Rym: She is a professional world or at least equestria renowned dress designer.

1005
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:56,740
Rym: They made her a maker and a doer and an expert.

1006
00:47:57,802 --> 00:48:08,880
Rym: And also in general, at least for us, I think, Scott, you're the one who said that watching them is like watching a pony front row crew, because if you notice the ponies that are the main characters are kind of like the leaders of everything in the town.

1007
00:48:09,901 --> 00:48:13,200
Scott: Well, I mean, well, the thing is, right, it's like the mayor is kind of incompetent.

1008
00:48:13,569 --> 00:48:13,760
Scott: Yeah.

1009
00:48:13,821 --> 00:48:15,620
Scott: And Twilight Sparkle, who's nobility.

1010
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:15,749
Scott: Right.

1011
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,239
Scott: It's basically Twilight Sparkle went out to Bumblefuck.

1012
00:48:18,468 --> 00:48:18,679
Scott: Yep.

1013
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,214
Scott: Ponyville.

1014
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:20,280
Scott: And she's nobility.

1015
00:48:20,502 --> 00:48:22,700
Scott: And she's actually educated because she's an academic.

1016
00:48:23,124 --> 00:48:24,298
Scott: So she actually knows things.

1017
00:48:25,021 --> 00:48:26,359
Rym: Except about Paris sprites.

1018
00:48:26,763 --> 00:48:27,237
Scott: Well, yeah.

1019
00:48:27,782 --> 00:48:31,239
Scott: And it's the only basically the few things that she doesn't know.

1020
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:39,720
Scott: Pinkie Pie is a secret genius and knows every and in the town, even though everyone is much less educated than Twilight Sparkle.

1021
00:48:39,781 --> 00:48:40,839
Scott: So she can totally help.

1022
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,620
Scott: You know, she can really run things, helping everybody.

1023
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:44,319
Rym: Yeah.

1024
00:48:45,062 --> 00:48:55,139
Scott: Even though they're much less educated, at least, you know, quite a few of the ponies just have a particular skill or three that they are just incredibly they're like superhuman super ponies of that one thing.

1025
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:55,396
Scott: Yeah.

1026
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:01,720
Rym: Well, the ponies, the main character ponies are definitely more highly skilled than the rest of the ponies on average.

1027
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:06,475
Scott: Well, at least the other ponies don't demonstrate their skills on screen often, or at least they don't.

1028
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,100
Scott: They also don't use their powers against D&D monsters.

1029
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:11,060
Scott: Like true.

1030
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:11,481
Scott: Mr.

1031
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:11,883
Scott: And Mrs.

1032
00:49:11,923 --> 00:49:19,420
Scott: Cake are probably just as good at making cake as you're probably better at it than Pinkie Pie, because Pinkie Pie also is partying and has partying skills.

1033
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,600
Rym: I saw a pretty good Andrew WK music video to Pinkie Pie.

1034
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:25,760
Scott: Her baking skills are secondary to her partying skills, right?

1035
00:49:26,081 --> 00:49:30,280
Scott: So they're probably really good at that, but they're not baking cakes and feeding them to the dragon.

1036
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,951
Rym: There are also incompetent ponies.

1037
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:34,699
Rym: You know, what's his name?

1038
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,498
Rym: The guy who lost the grass seeds.

1039
00:49:37,872 --> 00:49:38,140
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1040
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,519
Rym: Or the other guy who went south north to get the southern birds.

1041
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,939
Rym: And don't forget derp and derp.

1042
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,620
Scott: Derp and derp, snips and snails.

1043
00:49:49,263 --> 00:49:52,520
Scott: Or the barbell football and basketball ponies.

1044
00:49:53,387 --> 00:49:53,490
Rym: Yeah.

1045
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:54,949
Scott: Yeah.

1046
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:59,160
Scott: The show also cannot resist a horse related pun.

1047
00:49:59,440 --> 00:49:59,858
Rym: Oh, my God.

1048
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:00,958
Rym: But they do them.

1049
00:50:01,806 --> 00:50:02,539
Rym: I'm going to admit this.

1050
00:50:02,942 --> 00:50:03,740
Rym: I don't do it often.

1051
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:12,860
Rym: Scott doesn't do it often, but it happens occasionally when someone in the front row crew will say some pony or every pony instead of somebody.

1052
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,560
Scott: Yeah.

1053
00:50:14,002 --> 00:50:18,698
Scott: Or there's like, you know, Philadelphia, cloudsdale, trottingham.

1054
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:25,840
Scott: There's a lot of alliteration going on to plenty of this alliteration and horse related puns nonstop.

1055
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,360
Scott: But you know what?

1056
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,737
Scott: It's weird because usually puns are just like, oh, puns.

1057
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,759
Scott: They're just grown worthy to the max.

1058
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,520
Scott: But these are actually good puns and they don't use them too much.

1059
00:50:36,045 --> 00:50:36,597
Rym: Not too much.

1060
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,076
Scott: So it's tolerable.

1061
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:39,407
Rym: So, I mean, the moral of all.

1062
00:50:39,427 --> 00:50:41,440
Rym: this week, we're going to we'll talk about the show again.

1063
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,479
Rym: We've obviously tried to avoid the Gandalf questions, which are 90 percent of what I have to say.

1064
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,699
Rym: The show is great for what it is.

1065
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,058
Rym: I highly enjoy it.

1066
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,020
Scott: And it's really enjoyable.

1067
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:52,946
Scott: But it's like if I had to.

1068
00:50:53,007 --> 00:50:54,940
Scott: it's like, how much do I like it right now?

1069
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:57,280
Scott: I like it a whole lot more than anything else.

1070
00:50:57,381 --> 00:50:59,440
Scott: It's on my mind because it's subliminal powers.

1071
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,520
Scott: But how much do I like it compared to other things I like?

1072
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,218
Scott: Not as much, you know, probably in the expand of my life.

1073
00:51:06,901 --> 00:51:08,399
Scott: So it's just hot right now.

1074
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:13,759
Rym: How long between when the next episode is available and you watch it as fast as that guy gets it on YouTube?

1075
00:51:17,143 --> 00:51:19,080
Rym: It's also kind of a meta thing in the forum.

1076
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:19,679
Rym: We weren't kidding.

1077
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:25,599
Rym: My Little Pony thread is like 20 percent of the current activity in the forum right now.

1078
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:31,220
Scott: And most of it Gandalf gurthing talk, but also plenty of meme generating talk.

1079
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:39,740
Scott: You know, people making fan arts, fan mixes, you know, there's a pony in one fraction of a second in one episode.

1080
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,594
Scott: It was a DJ.

1081
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,706
Scott: So now DJ Pwn-E.

1082
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,660
Scott: They gave it a name and there's plenty of YouTube videos of DJ Pwn-E DJing.

1083
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:52,837
Scott: And it's like, OK, this is way out of control, which tells you that they're doing something right.

1084
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:53,353
Rym: Yep.

1085
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:57,180
Rym: So if you care about My Little Pony and in particular.

1086
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,540
Scott: And no matter how skeptical you are, some people probably haven't listened this far because they were skeptical.

1087
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,279
Scott: But you know what?

1088
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:02,717
Rym: Screw you.

1089
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,100
Rym: Everybody we've shown it to with one exception has been turned.

1090
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,959
Scott: If you are a skeptical anti pony type and you've managed to listen this far just because you wanted to be like, what the fuck, guys?

1091
00:52:12,106 --> 00:52:12,360
Scott: Really?

1092
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,020
Scott: Are you serious?

1093
00:52:13,181 --> 00:52:13,920
Scott: We are serious.

1094
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:14,640
Scott: It's not a joke.

1095
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,177
Scott: It's a good show.

1096
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,886
Scott: Just you know, we do not.

1097
00:52:17,007 --> 00:52:19,420
Scott: we at GeekNights do not knock it if we haven't tried it.

1098
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,979
Scott: However, we try and then knock quite often.

1099
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:29,619
Scott: So if you are knocking right now, just try watch episodes one and two and then knock all you want if you want.

1100
00:52:29,802 --> 00:52:31,119
Scott: But don't knock until then.

1101
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:42,499
Rym: But as I was saying, if you care in particular about the fact that Rainbow Dash is in fact the best pony in Ponyville, you should go to the forum and vote in our which My Little Pony pony is the best pony thread.

1102
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:45,258
Scott: There's only one right here.

1103
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:52,370
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1104
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:57,530
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1105
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:02,950
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1106
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,870
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1107
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:10,250
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1109
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:18,470
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1110
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,570
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
