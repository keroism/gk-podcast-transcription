00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,432
Rym: It's Wednesday January 12th, 2011.

2
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:18,680
Rym: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights Tonight who framed Roger rabbit.

3
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:23,067
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:36,114
Rym: So a little context if I may this episode was actually recorded quite some time ago and we kind of kept it in the hopper until we had an occasion to use it and that occasion has Come upon us.

5
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:43,269
Rym: as by the time you're listening to this Scott And I are probably on our ways to magfest 9 and thus we wouldn't be around to do a show.

6
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:48,410
Rym: So some of the news is a little out of date and we may or may not have used one of these things of the day.

7
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,650
Rym: Again, I can't recall but it's a good show and we talk about Roger rabbit with a guest.

8
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:06,180
Rym: No, there's a show that we watch a long time ago that I'd forgotten about until randomly a little while ago.

9
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:07,779
Scott: I did not forget about it.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,312
Rym: Well, I forgot about it in the way you forget about old anime.

11
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:12,482
Rym: you watch it and then you just don't like it doesn't come To mind.

12
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:14,291
Rym: it's not like I'd be walking down the street and suddenly.

13
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,140
Rym: Oh shit mahout sky time.

14
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:23,943
Scott: It's not a show that really anyone talks about but it was you know, it's in that same category as like, you know El Hazzard.

15
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:24,445
Scott: Yeah.

16
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:27,577
Rym: Well, it was just I remembered being really cute and I remember the crew.

17
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:28,400
Rym: we all watched it.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,420
Scott: It's actually similar to El Hazzard also structurally that there's no AV and a TV series.

19
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:33,485
Rym: Is it similar?

20
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:36,360
Rym: in the same way that the OAV is the only good part the TV series is?

21
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:40,359
Scott: I don't remember the TV series cuz you know, I never watched it.

22
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:43,580
Scott: Yeah, so anyway, we're gonna rewatch this and we're it's gonna be a show.

23
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:53,680
Rym: Yeah It's funny because I barely like I remembered the anime club fighting in the beginning and it was about magic and I remember this One scene where she's dumb and she makes this room like half on the roof on the ground.

24
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:57,240
Scott: I remembered that aliens with the black ball that rolls down the street.

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,949
Scott: Yeah, but that's that, you know, of course there.

26
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,366
Rym: I mean there's the similar weird stuff in gatekeepers With the red hats.

27
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:18,640
Rym: Yeah, but once I saw that opener with the little dot That suddenly everything clicked together I was like, oh yeah this show and it says something, you know Sometimes I rewatch an anime and I'm not bored.

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,551
Rym: It's more like I remember what's happening and I'm like, ah, I got to go through all this shit again But some shows like ghost in the shell watching them again.

29
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:27,394
Rym: It's like oh man.

30
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,337
Rym: I remember this.

31
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:29,080
Rym: This is awesome.

32
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:31,769
Rym: The show gives me more the latter than the former.

33
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:32,892
Scott: Yeah, we'll see.

34
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:33,595
Scott: We'll see.

35
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:35,240
Scott: I only watched one episode again.

36
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,309
Scott: So I got five more OAV episodes.

37
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:37,752
Scott: I watched.

38
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:38,374
Scott: I'm not gonna.

39
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:40,344
Scott: I'm not gonna rewatch the TV I'm not.

40
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:41,449
Rym: even I don't know if we ever did.

41
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:41,992
Rym: Well, I don't know.

42
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:42,373
Scott: I don't know.

43
00:02:42,393 --> 00:02:43,780
Scott: the TV's good bad different.

44
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:44,898
Scott: I don't think I ever watched it.

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,440
Rym: Well as a warning Ella's are the TV and the second OAV not worth watching?

46
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:53,981
Rym: Mmm, the TV show is basically the OAV done again, you know now that I think of it Like.

47
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,385
Scott: I'm not even a hundred percent positive.

48
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,034
Scott: There actually was a hosukai type TV.

49
00:02:58,215 --> 00:02:59,539
Rym: I'm pretty sure there was.

50
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:01,690
Scott: I got to actually go check.

51
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,319
Rym: Yeah, I have to as well.

52
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:09,010
Scott: I Couldn't really find any exciting news nothing.

53
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,475
Scott: No, but I do.

54
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:11,900
Scott: I will do geek bite instead.

55
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:20,565
Scott: And the geek bite I will do is not actually a comic or an anime but is related and I watched the first episode of that Walking Dead TV.

56
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:23,033
Rym: Ah, I also have seen the first episode.

57
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:28,389
Rym: apparently my workers are watching it Like like they're watching it right along with the bittorrents.

58
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:32,380
Rym: Yeah, I mean it wasn't departed way away from the comic.

59
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:48,215
Scott: Yeah, I mean the first episode like as I don't really remember, you know the complete details of the early parts of the comic but the You know this first episode Definitely had the same tone and characterizations as the as the comic.

60
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:52,579
Scott: Yeah, you know, it definitely felt like oh, yeah This is definitely Walking Dead zombie world, you know.

61
00:03:53,041 --> 00:04:02,098
Scott: Well, it felt it had that kind of gritty realism that most zombie things don't really and the characters act the way the characters act in Walking Dead and the zombies act the way they act in Walking Dead.

62
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,812
Scott: and They also sort of it seemed to me like they muted the colors to.

63
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:12,100
Scott: you know, it wasn't actually monochrome But the show definitely felt like it was sort of like they took half the color out.

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,871
Scott: You know a lot more like the comic which is monochrome.

65
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:17,394
Rym: randomly over the weekend.

66
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:20,475
Rym: I watched the machinist Just a movie that I hadn't watched.

67
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:20,920
Rym: I was bored.

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,579
Rym: It's Dostoevsky retold.

69
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:28,233
Rym: It's about a guy who hasn't slept in a year and is kind of going crazy.

70
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:34,947
Rym: and people you go crazy after three days Yeah, and people are leaving post-it notes in his apartment and they Know they're not.

71
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:41,329
Scott: he's just going crazy thinking this posted Clearly and it's basically Dostoevsky.

72
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:42,773
Rym: It's like crime and punishment kind of thing.

73
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:44,920
Rym: It's really good, but it did the same thing.

74
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,760
Rym: It was black and white but not really like it was black and white but every now and then like things would be almost color.

75
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:55,680
Scott: I mean the show wasn't actually black and white but at least it felt like there was some color that was removed.

76
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:57,249
Rym: You sure you have you watch anything else.

77
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:58,255
Rym: is your TVs fine?

78
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:01,700
Scott: Yeah TV is just fine.

79
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:07,000
Scott: But basically, yeah, I mean this wasn't a show where it's like, oh man, so I gotta watch every episode day comes out.

80
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,190
Scott: It's so awesome.

81
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:11,012
Rym: But I In the background, it's a show.

82
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:12,100
Scott: This is not a bad.

83
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:16,660
Scott: It is not one of those travesties where it's like, oh it ruins all the good from the original.

84
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:24,060
Scott: you know the beginning of The Walking Dead is probably the best part of the comic and This show is also good in the same way for the same reasons.

85
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:32,359
Rym: Well, like freaks and geeks or you know arrested development shows that I would never sit down and just watch but I'm hanging out Playing a game I could watch it like while I'm doing stuff.

86
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:37,200
Scott: Yeah, you know this is a show where it's like if I you know, it'll go somewhere in the middle of the queue.

87
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:40,620
Scott: It's like if I'm you know run out of like the best stuff to watch.

88
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,332
Rym: It's like oh kind of thing I put on the TV when I'm I don't know mopping or doing all my grown-up stuff.

89
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:48,746
Scott: if it turned bad in a later episode I would just well stop watching.

90
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,420
Rym: well bad in the way that the comic gets kind of dumb later.

91
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:56,829
Scott: Oh, well the comic gets dumb and then undumb and then you know It's a very switchy back and forth.

92
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:59,740
Scott: you think the comic also wasn't helped by the changing of artists.

93
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,855
Scott: You know, the original artist is much better than the artist they switched to.

94
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:07,880
Rym: Sorry - though Apparently artist they say I mean the TV show is short and it's gonna end and they already signed on.

95
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,510
Rym: They're going to make a sequel obviously a second season.

96
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:10,691
Scott: Yeah.

97
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,840
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, we'll see how it goes.

98
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:17,611
Rym: It seems to be really popular I'm pretty sure all those actors and be big at the New York Comic Con.

99
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:24,140
Scott: if you like a walking dead and you like a Zombie or both or you know, you should probably read the comic and watch this show.

100
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:32,511
Rym: I'll say this they're pretty much equal on the enjoyment level of all the zombie things other than Of the living dead the original zombie thing.

101
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:42,672
Rym: Well effectively the original zombie thing I don't you know, there's other zombie things that came before that but It's pretty much the best if you want realism and interesting characters.

102
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:43,996
Scott: How about Dawn of the Dead?

103
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:46,188
Rym: Dawn of the Dead was good It's right.

104
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:46,775
Rym: It's up there.

105
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:51,319
Rym: Close might be a tie but World War Z is nowhere near.

106
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:52,979
Scott: Anyway, anyway.

107
00:06:53,907 --> 00:07:01,040
Rym: So our friend Mike tool, you know We write stuff for the anime news network among other awesome things and he does very amazing panels.

108
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,176
Rym: Have you ever had an anime convention and you see Mike tool doing anything?

109
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:04,758
Rym: Just go see it.

110
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,464
Rym: It doesn't matter what it is even if it doesn't look like.

111
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:08,006
Rym: you'll like it.

112
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:13,043
Rym: you'll like it trust us because if nothing else he'll just show you stuff that you Would never see.

113
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:14,709
Scott: that's generally the trick is people don't?

114
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,930
Scott: most people don't realize when you're deciding what panel to go to at a con Don't look at what the panels about right?

115
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,854
Scott: Look at who's doing it.

116
00:07:21,135 --> 00:07:23,820
Rym: Yeah, Daryl Surratt It doesn't matter what he's talking about.

117
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,175
Scott: It's gonna be hilarious or us or Mike tool or any of the other awesome people.

118
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:37,380
Rym: Yeah Christian daily You know old RIT anime president, but speaking of old RIT anime Mike tool did a recent article that we're actually featured in a little bit.

119
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:43,270
Rym: He emailed us and a bunch of other people we know some time ago and he was like Hey, you guys were big in anime clubs.

120
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:45,820
Rym: Tell me a little bit about your old anime clubs.

121
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:47,960
Rym: I'm doing an article on him and the current state of him and everything.

122
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,200
Scott: So you said I'm like a fucking essay.

123
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,076
Scott: I said him like a five-page and he was like I expected like a paragraph.

124
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:56,825
Scott: you guys sent me an essay But it's like.

125
00:07:57,067 --> 00:08:03,334
Scott: dude, you should know if you ask us anything We're gonna you know, we're gonna give you every piece of information that we've got.

126
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:04,880
Scott: We're not gonna hold anything back like Rym.

127
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,649
Rym: How long's your penis?

128
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:16,480
Scott: Well If we measure it in Cartesian coordinates Let us go down and discuss every molecule from the base to the tip by number of zip codes.

129
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:24,180
Scott: It will be point zero zero zero zero zero zero times ten to the six times ten to the negative.

130
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:29,533
Rym: It's not as big as Gandalf's zip codes the solid nine inches.

131
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:31,320
Rym: Yeah, but anyway.

132
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,100
Rym: So he did this article on anime clubs and it's really good.

133
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:45,107
Rym: he talks about the current state of them what they were in the past and if you don't if you're an anime fan and You're already on the right track.

134
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:52,560
Rym: like you're paying attention to directors and character designers And you're going to conventions and learning about anime and watching weird old stuff.

135
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,579
Rym: You're on the right track.

136
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,840
Rym: But the next step is to actually read articles about anime written by people who know what they're talking about.

137
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,468
Rym: You know the books the articles the lectures.

138
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:02,711
Rym: Fred showed all those people.

139
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:04,095
Rym: That's the next step.

140
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:04,818
Rym: So it's shot.

141
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:05,620
Rym: I had his shot.

142
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,840
Rym: I realized that I was hoping you would just be quiet.

143
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:08,946
Rym: Let me continue on.

144
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:10,938
Rym: then I was gonna edit it out later in post.

145
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:11,220
Rym: but now.

146
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:16,600
Rym: So this article is fascinating and as an aside Scott doesn't think you'd want to hear it?

147
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:17,385
Rym: I think you would.

148
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:18,311
Rym: we haven't done it a long time.

149
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:21,408
Rym: Should we do a show on r.i.t Anime, we already did the show.

150
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,211
Rym: I think we should do one.

151
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:23,337
Scott: We already did the show.

152
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:24,040
Rym: see listeners.

153
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,333
Scott: We don't have a shortage of Wednesday show listeners.

154
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:28,800
Rym: What do you want?

155
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,379
Rym: They want whatever Scott doesn't want because I I am the candidate who is here for you.

156
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,440
Scott: Whatever you I just gonna have to figure out all the shows that I want to do that You don't want to do and then ask the listeners and they'll be like we don't want to do that.

157
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:44,779
Scott: About that we'll say zombies.

158
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:47,839
Rym: Zombies are constitutionally banned.

159
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,813
Scott: There's a constitution of geek names.

160
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:51,559
Rym: There is now.

161
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,380
Rym: But what this article really struck me when I read it and then when I thought about what I'd written.

162
00:09:58,481 --> 00:09:59,165
Scott: I haven't read it yet.

163
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:03,665
Rym: So I got it and seeing other anime clubs Goddamn was the r.i.t.

164
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:04,628
Rym: Anime Club awesome.

165
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:09,411
Rym: Like I always thought in my head like yeah, that club was crazy Awesome, but it was my club.

166
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:10,900
Rym: I have a very skewed opinion.

167
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:17,340
Rym: Jesus Christ RIT anime is like the best anime club ever.

168
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,330
Scott: I don't know if it's a thing is like.

169
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:21,200
Scott: I don't know if it's still what it was, right?

170
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,971
Rym: It's like the last I heard it was.

171
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:24,922
Rym: we ran into the publicist I met.

172
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:34,014
Scott: I met the librarian and it sounded like, you know, they lost their club space But he was still keeping the library strong as best he could but I'd still.

173
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:40,863
Scott: I couldn't get any idea of like how many people Showing or if they were still doing as many less as bigly and awesome numbers I got.

174
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:44,836
Rym: as an aside if you look in the comments on Mike's thing more people mention r.i.t.

175
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:45,920
Rym: Anime than any other club.

176
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,125
Rym: So, uh-huh.

177
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:49,434
Rym: Well, you know, but and a lot of r.i.t.

178
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:50,699
Rym: Anime people are out and about doing.

179
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:54,602
Rym: you know big stuff running conventions and everything, but I Don't know.

180
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:56,291
Rym: I feel like r.i.t.

181
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:57,377
Rym: Anime is still pretty strong.

182
00:10:57,497 --> 00:11:01,637
Rym: less numbers I heard where they're still pushing 150 or so people in meeting give or take.

183
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:03,689
Rym: Hmm I don't know how accurate that is.

184
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,273
Rym: If any r.i.t.

185
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:09,177
Scott: Anime people are listening You know, I know that we do have listeners at r.i.t.

186
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:09,780
Scott: At least one.

187
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,251
Rym: So if you're not going to the club go and go.

188
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,776
Scott: not go into the club go spy Just go to it once and tell me what's going on.

189
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:21,320
Scott: or you know Tell the president to email us or some shit because I don't let's get them on this.

190
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,520
Scott: Let's actually get the r.i.t.

191
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,384
Scott: We should get the r.i.t.

192
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:24,570
Scott: Anime club president on the show.

193
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,500
Scott: then we could do a show about anime club.

194
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:29,077
Rym: Actually, it would be a fun thing is try to get all the r.i.t.

195
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:31,244
Scott: Presidents As many r.i.t.

196
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,970
Scott: Anime club presidents as possible on the show.

197
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,874
Scott: at one time we could.

198
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:34,636
Rym: I could get six.

199
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:35,640
Scott: we could probably get.

200
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:36,998
Scott: Let's see you.

201
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:42,202
Scott: Scott Johnson Lisa Christian daily Luke Technically.

202
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:43,767
Rym: Mike Lynn was president for a little while.

203
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,875
Scott: Yeah, but how are we gonna contact Mike Lynn?

204
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,545
Rym: I I could get contact with.

205
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:50,190
Scott: we could get Jason or Saudi.

206
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,360
Scott: Yeah, and I guess Liz.

207
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,449
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if we can get Liz.

208
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,234
Rym: I think we get Liz.

209
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:00,857
Scott: Well, we know like Yeah, the other guy named Scott that we don't really know.

210
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:04,375
Rym: I don't know him But the thing is Christian daily might be able to get him.

211
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:11,194
Scott: and if he can't Yeah, plus I think I think I mean that tells you something about the r.i.t.

212
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:11,676
Scott: Anime club.

213
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,020
Scott: right how many people did we just name?

214
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:17,126
Scott: like ten people and But you're only in college for four years.

215
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:20,015
Rym: So somehow the Hall of Kings was remembered.

216
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:30,528
Scott: It's like yeah, it's like There are kings from before we were even there and kings after we left and we still know them You know and they're all connected to each other.

217
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:33,840
Scott: That's that's you know, and some of these people had multi-year reigns.

218
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,926
Scott: This was not like.

219
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:37,360
Scott: everyone was in an in-and-out situation.

220
00:12:38,762 --> 00:12:40,651
Scott: Some of these people had very short reigns though as well.

221
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:47,999
Rym: Yes, there was political drama There were there were kings and despots and revolutions and all king is dead and long live the king.

222
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:54,100
Rym: But anyway check this article out king and if you're at a convention keep an eye out for Mike tool.

223
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,582
Rym: He's.

224
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:58,576
Rym: he's on the good list in our opinion of anime and wearing MLS soccer trees.

225
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:00,746
Scott: That's how you know, Mike tool is Yeah, really big.

226
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:05,999
Rym: Yeah, like whoa, he's tall He could crush my head like a watermelon.

227
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:16,020
Rym: Anyway things of the day.

228
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:26,811
Rym: So I like anime openers like there was a time before I had access to a lot of anime and before there was YouTube Or bit tauren or anything like that.

229
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:38,180
Rym: I would go to sites and download Avi's or m pegs of the openers to anime that were not available in the u.s Yeah I mean there are still some shows where I've only ever seen the opener.

230
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,914
Scott: I've never seen the show and it was like that weird fucked up Pokemon ish thing.

231
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:44,580
Rym: Oh, right jeep baku.

232
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:46,511
Scott: Yeah, what the fuck was that?

233
00:13:46,531 --> 00:13:47,074
Scott: Yeah, sure.

234
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,080
Scott: We could find out what it is.

235
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,522
Rym: I did.

236
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:59,640
Scott: I actually I do know what this story was with that or like Aaron's about you that we found out later was actually Shitty fighting game that had a different name in the u.s Yeah, they actually had a used copy of the GameStop that we didn't buy.

237
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:06,118
Scott: They see the shittiest fighting game in the world with the real the best opener and opening song in the world.

238
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:07,042
Rym: that opener I was like.

239
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:08,849
Rym: this anime is so of my.

240
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:11,840
Scott: I mean, it's a fighting anime, but goddamn was that a good opener?

241
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:15,460
Rym: I think the song was primarily what made it a good opener.

242
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,811
Scott: Yeah, that's kind of like most of what an opener is.

243
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,780
Rym: is the song kind of like a tenshi muyo gxp?

244
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,830
Scott: Yeah, that was the best opener to the worst show.

245
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:31,150
Scott: I mean if you took opener quality to show quality ratios Tenshi muyo gxp is the highest ever.

246
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,680
Rym: I mean the only thing that might possibly beat it is noir.

247
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:37,815
Scott: No, because noir is a much better show than tenshi muyo gxp.

248
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:38,498
Scott: Yeah, you're right.

249
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:39,060
Rym: You're right.

250
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,772
Scott: No opener is not as good as the tenshi muyo gxp opening.

251
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:42,174
Rym: You're right.

252
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:49,508
Rym: nuns with guns lava No blood, you know one woman with a pistol takes out like 80 guys Open field.

253
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:50,959
Rym: that show wasn't stupid.

254
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:53,470
Rym: But tenshi muyo the worst I'd say.

255
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,275
Scott: noir is a good show.

256
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:55,100
Scott: I'm just saying who is better?

257
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,480
Scott: It's like comparing two poops, which is the least smelly poop, you know, what's great.

258
00:14:58,622 --> 00:14:59,900
Rym: You know gxp was bad.

259
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:08,520
Rym: But the worst part is not only was it bad But none of the characters that the fanboys even wanted to see her in that goddamn thing for like the first half.

260
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:11,790
Scott: Is it better or worse than photon?

261
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:12,894
Rym: I don't know.

262
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:14,960
Rym: I put them in the same category of unwatchable.

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,023
Rym: It's like the untouchables.

264
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:17,046
Scott: They're basically the same.

265
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,369
Scott: They're easily the same thing, right?

266
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,873
Rym: They're yeah untouchable.

267
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:23,393
Scott: I Don't know they might be unlookable.

268
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:27,057
Rym: So anyway This is simply every.

269
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:34,645
Rym: well You know We have those things we show at anime cons or whenever we need to like fill a room or kill some time of every robot Anime opener in contiguous order.

270
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:35,206
Scott: I love that.

271
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,349
Scott: We should watch this.

272
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:40,260
Rym: is that for anime that aren't robot shows?

273
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,086
Rym: But interestingly enough some of them are robot.

274
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:45,860
Rym: It's really short and you'll see why because it's every anime opener ever.

275
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:48,816
Scott: It is every anime opener ever.

276
00:15:48,896 --> 00:16:00,386
Rym: It's great Just like it was good the part when it just starts panning up to someone's face and then into the sky Like that was the best part The part where people are running to the left.

277
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:04,860
Scott: Yep, or the subtle one where the birds birds birds different birds more birds.

278
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,160
Rym: Well, there's two different kinds of birds.

279
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,660
Rym: There's like the one seagull flying out over the ocean and then there's the flock of birds.

280
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,516
Scott: There's a drop of water drop of water drop water drop water drop.

281
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:17,487
Rym: the teardrops go Sideways from a woman as she turns her head.

282
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:21,440
Scott: Yeah, or the head turning head head turn to look at the camera.

283
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,644
Scott: I don't look at the camera didn't?

284
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:26,860
Rym: the subtlest one was the zoom in shakily on an action scene.

285
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:28,671
Rym: Oh, that's a good reason.

286
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,020
Rym: not many old anime did that.

287
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:32,795
Scott: Anyway, so check this out, right?

288
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:39,985
Scott: some guy You know how some people would like take the shinning and then they would make it look like it was a feel-good movie Except between the hours of what?

289
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:40,506
Rym: two and four.

290
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:45,420
Rym: Yeah, that's Willis time really the most quotable episodes of The Simpsons ever, right?

291
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,324
Rym: basically Also a movie.

292
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:52,079
Scott: what these people did here or maybe one person did is they took?

293
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,743
Scott: Akira the movie.

294
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,551
Scott: All right, and they took some music.

295
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:58,677
Scott: I'm not sure exactly what music it is.

296
00:16:58,837 --> 00:16:59,499
Scott: It's very is it?

297
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:00,540
Scott: yeah It's very familiar.

298
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,743
Scott: It's not Final Fantasy music.

299
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:06,790
Scott: yes, that's Lapta.

300
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:07,372
Scott: does?

301
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:09,739
Scott: I feel like there's a Final Fantasy song that's very similar.

302
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:17,400
Scott: Anyway, it's a little kind of similar But it's like the Lapta music and they took Akira and they put them together and it's Akira x Ghibli.

303
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:20,095
Scott: So it looks like Akira was a Ghibli movie.

304
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:20,859
Rym: You know what this gives me?

305
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:22,259
Rym: Ghibli Ghibli.

306
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:33,822
Scott: Anyway, it's it's pretty good and it serves many purposes like reminding you that Akira is amazing and lol Look at that.

307
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:37,580
Scott: They made Akira look like Ghibli and if you've seen Akira, it's like double lol.

308
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:51,031
Scott: You know what's actually going on in that scene versus what this sort of fake trailer would imply is going on in that scene Like Speaking of the Ghibli Ghiblis.

309
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:58,760
Rym: before we get to the meta moment I just want to point out you should go on YouTube and watch all the cutscenes from poker night of the inventory.

310
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:02,828
Rym: Yeah as a show it's basically like a half hour Animated show.

311
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:03,814
Scott: think of it as an anime.

312
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:04,920
Scott: don't think of it as a game, right?

313
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,451
Scott: I bought the game because it was like five bucks, right?

314
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:08,315
Rym: I watched it on YouTube.

315
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:09,280
Rym: Does that mean I pirated it?

316
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:10,042
Scott: I don't know.

317
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:12,011
Scott: but basically right it's you play.

318
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:13,840
Scott: all you do in this game is play poker.

319
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:16,106
Rym: All you do in this game is watch the heavy.

320
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,012
Scott: you play the tiny heavy.

321
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:22,485
Scott: you play poker with strong bed the heavy Tycho from penny arcade.

322
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:25,253
Scott: and this is it max from Sam and Max?

323
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:27,500
Rym: I think you've never played a 7 max game.

324
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,447
Rym: Have you no idea?

325
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,117
Rym: actually he I think is the weakest link in this show.

326
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:38,340
Rym: Yeah He only has one trick, but they use the shik a little too much.

327
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:44,100
Scott: Yeah Basically you're playing poker with these four guys who are fictional characters and they're very funny.

328
00:18:44,362 --> 00:18:50,680
Scott: They're very funny until they start repeating the same joke over and over again And then you're done and it's basically a single-player poker game that you you know.

329
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,260
Scott: He just goes on forever with nothing else really going on.

330
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,106
Scott: So you might as well.

331
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:56,040
Scott: the only reason to play it is for the joke.

332
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,039
Scott: So watch all the jokes on YouTube and then you're done just when heavy keeps calling strong bad tiny heavy.

333
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:03,775
Rym: There's something about that.

334
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:11,100
Scott: So without any further ado the meta Moment, let's try not to forget any things.

335
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,617
Rym: All right for anyone who hasn't paid attention the geek died store has one item for sale our original t-shirt.

336
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:21,329
Rym: We will have new stuff Relatively soon, but don't hold your breath cuz he'll die.

337
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:21,409
Scott: Yep.

338
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:25,300
Scott: There was something to correct from a previous Wednesday episode.

339
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,010
Scott: I wanted to make a correction, but I forgot what we got wrong, but we did get something wrong and we will correct it.

340
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:32,937
Scott: Yeah, really really?

341
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,651
Rym: Just We're gonna be at mag fest.

00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:46,094
Rym: losing should be fun.

00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:52,745
Scott: It's good panel, whatever Mag festival see a party.

348

Scott: Max East is in a hundred days 99 days fuck.

351
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:00,738
Rym: we're gonna be at anime Boston most likely.

352
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:03,711
Rym: We'll see if we'll be at Otakon.

353
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,179
Rym: I'm gonna put this out there right now.

354
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:10,456
Rym: We've never been denied in like a decade panels at Otakon.

355
00:20:10,497 --> 00:20:11,660
Rym: every year since 2002.

356
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,767
Rym: We've done one or more one year.

357
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:14,810
Rym: We did like seven.

358
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:19,042
Scott: we denied them last year just because they didn't get the schedule to us 2,000 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.

359
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:19,424
Rym: so they mine.

360
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:27,995
Scott: they might Legitimately deny us because we denied them and they're like, oh those guys are now unreliable.

361
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:29,380
Scott: So then we're gonna deny them.

362
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,766
Rym: I just want to get it out here now.

363
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:31,067
Rym: It'll be.

364
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:33,318
Rym: it'll be very telling as to how they can do.

365
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:39,265
Scott: if they want I don't care they can and if they don't then if they get the schedule out on time Then we'll go.

366
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:41,040
Rym: thing is it wasn't even the panel schedule.

367
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,451
Rym: It was our own staff schedule.

368
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:43,600
Rym: was what we were waiting on.

369
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:54,199
Rym: Yeah, right, but basically I just get this out here now because we're gonna you know if we're gonna submit our panels to Otakon like we do every year and Our panels have never failed to fill the room.

370
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,535
Rym: So we'll see if Otakon wants us to do panels or not.

371
00:20:57,575 --> 00:21:01,828
Rym: if we don't appear at Otakon It is not because we are not willing to do panels.

372
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:06,120
Scott: No, it's you know, because something they did not, you know do enough.

373
00:21:06,522 --> 00:21:10,102
Rym: Yeah, and if you have any strong feelings about that let appropriate people know I guess.

374
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:12,820
Scott: and if you if you want to say well, why should they do anything for you?

375
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,368
Scott: It's like well look at what Pax does for us.

376
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:20,813
Scott: Yeah, and so everyone else, you know Anime Boston does more for us than anyone else.

377
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,019
Scott: They do more for us than Pax.

378
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:24,568
Scott: So Otakon is just us to step up.

379
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:36,400
Rym: also as another kind of I'm curious listeners out there Let me know if you've been to like this comment whenever Katsucon happens again Because we stopped going to Katsucon when all the staff we knew quit and the con had a lot of trouble.

380
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,446
Scott: We're also gonna Zenkai con.

381
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:37,868
Scott: What's that?

382
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:38,451
Rym: Oh, yeah.

383
00:21:38,512 --> 00:21:38,753
Rym: Fuck.

00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:39,960
Rym: It's my calendar.

386
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:42,011
Rym: Yeah, we'll be a Zenkai con doing a bunch of panels.

387
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:43,560
Rym: I don't even know which ones will be fine.

388
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,286
Scott: Was it November?

389
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:45,295
Scott: I feel like we made.

390
00:21:45,335 --> 00:21:45,819
Scott: do we miss it?

391
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,341
Rym: I don't.

392
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:47,124
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

393
00:21:47,144 --> 00:21:51,440
Rym: if we missed it the staff would have said something like where are you guys?

394
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,982
Scott: I think they just remember it's supposed to be in November But I guess that's.

395
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:58,879
Rym: it has to be wrong if my phone starts ringing and someone's like guys your panels in like 20 minutes.

396
00:21:59,203 --> 00:21:59,736
Rym: Where are you?

Rym: And I'll be like, New York.

398
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:07,005
Rym: That's pretty much it.

399
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,517
Scott: yeah, I don't remember any book club.

400
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:10,066
Scott: is World War Z.

401
00:22:10,187 --> 00:22:11,620
Rym: World War Z was the book club.

402
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,111
Rym: We're gonna do that review as soon as we do a Thursday episode.

403
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:20,297
Rym: and the next book club book, which we've already announced I'll keep announcing is Michio Kaku's hyperspace, which is a book about reality.

404
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:22,282
Rym: great Good book.

405
00:22:22,302 --> 00:22:22,964
Rym: what's wrong with you?

406
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:24,709
Scott: Not exactly fun.

407
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:26,293
Rym: Ah, actually it's really fun.

408
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:28,680
Rym: Yeah, you don't even know what it's about.

409
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,069
Scott: I'm gonna counter with some fun.

410
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:36,635
Rym: You're gonna counter with some fun because for every counter of fun you have I have a counter counter unfun.

411
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:39,247
Rym: Anyway, you keep pushing.

412
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:40,192
Rym: you're reading Ulysses.

413
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:41,860
Scott: You don't want to read that.

414
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:50,599
Rym: Okay, so So because it's her favorite movie and being an animator she has some expertise.

415
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:56,505
Scott: It's really a favorite movie Like a lot.

416
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:59,615
Rym: it is definitely on my list of movies that like.

417
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:01,000
Rym: it's in my top 50 of movies.

418
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,529
Scott: I think top hundred of movies.

419
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:18,800
Emily: and we were going to do this show together Like a way long time ago like a month ago, but because of a crashing Maya and various other problems I was way late and I only caught the tail end and then I had a phone meeting with Taiwan.

420
00:23:20,043 --> 00:23:25,560
Emily: The show was Postponed until a later date because I said guys can't do it without me.

421
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:32,008
Rym: I have to be there for the work even now and it's postponed even later because we're recording this ahead of time while we're gonna be At magfest.

422
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:32,836
Emily: That's right.

423
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:36,308
Scott: Yes Well now they know the secret.

424
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:39,320
Rym: Oh no the magic of radio has been ruined.

425
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,559
Scott: At least they will not have any strange questions about like why is the news so?

426
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:45,867
Rym: It's pretty sure.

427
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:47,939
Scott: one of the things of the day is a repeat thing of the day.

428
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:50,270
Rym: We'll find out saying that but it is.

429
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:52,380
Rym: I mean what anime news did we even talk about?

430
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,333
Rym: I have to go find out and then make this post.

431
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:54,998
Scott: That's right.

432
00:23:55,741 --> 00:23:56,865
Rym: So what we're talking about?

433
00:23:56,905 --> 00:24:01,479
Rym: a movie from 1988 an animated wealth path animated movie who framed Roger.

434
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:05,291
Scott: We were six years old, but Emily was what like.

435
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:06,756
Emily: I didn't see it in the theaters.

436
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:07,899
Scott: I think I didn't either.

437
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:15,253
Emily: I Must have been maybe about seven or eight and I saw it on VHS at my aunt's house And I remember.

438
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:16,041
Emily: you know It's.

439
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:25,170
Emily: it's very strange thinking back on my first impressions the movie because I remember it being a lot scarier Because I mean I was like seven.

440
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:32,851
Emily: I hadn't seen a ton of film noir Detective judge doom at the end and the dip scared Was awful.

441
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:33,780
Scott: it was a little bit scary.

442
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:42,861
Emily: It was this one part with a part where they're torturing the shoe with the dip and I was like, oh, this is awful It's like horrible acid shit, I hate it I hate.

443
00:24:42,962 --> 00:24:50,588
Emily: I was so scared of that when I was a little kid and then like once I became older I realized that it was all a joke like that.

444
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:54,700
Emily: Yep was turpentine and that's what they used to clean the cells off.

445
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:00,487
Scott: Clean the cells off with.

446
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:01,612
Scott: but I'm like, why did?

447
00:25:01,692 --> 00:25:03,440
Scott: why would you clean off the cell?

448
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,696
Scott: It's like you just drew the art on it and then they reuse them.

449
00:25:05,857 --> 00:25:11,238
Rym: Yeah, it's From old Disney stuff.

450
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:18,434
Emily: If they wanted to save money Especially on low-budget productions, they would just keep using cells.

451
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:20,319
Scott: and actually how much is the cell cost?

452
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,124
Emily: I don't know, but they add up.

453
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:25,637
Emily: think of how many frames makes your typical animated movie.

454
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:34,120
Scott: and especially I mean I could understand Understand if you like, you know a race like the cell of the guy's really tiny and far away.

455
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:36,359
Scott: But if it's like the cell of like he's right up.

456
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:42,767
Rym: Wasn't it a lot like with old TV shows where they just thought they didn't think there was any value to the fact out Doctor who?

457
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:44,539
Emily: and so there's all these lost episodes.

458
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,735
Scott: I mean like live radio programs were not recorded in any way shape or form because They just broadcasted some guys with microphones.

459
00:25:51,755 --> 00:25:52,338
Scott: and then that was it.

460
00:25:52,740 --> 00:26:02,210
Emily: well back then I think they didn't even anticipate that there would be a secondary market for Things on on tape or on on digital media.

461
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,015
Emily: I mean there wasn't any digital media.

462
00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:15,517
Emily: and so they figured well we'll have prints of the film, but we don't actually need to go back and Reshoot the film or scan it in because you know that hadn't been invented yet.

463
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:19,687
Emily: They couldn't have known Cells would turn out to be used.

464
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:25,360
Scott: Yeah, but even like, you know, regardless of you know, the technology that's available It's like, you know There was just no set.

465
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,403
Scott: It's like they hadn't learned the lessons of any of the previous centuries.

466
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:29,730
Scott: of that you must preserve.

467
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:36,000
Scott: put effort into preserving the art or That's a relatively recent movement and also I see beams are pretty old.

468
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,800
Emily: I think part of it is like television and animation and stuff.

469
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:50,880
Emily: It wasn't necessarily viewed as a fine art but as cheap entertainment, so it it was more an assembly line production than actually.

470
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:54,914
Emily: You know the feeling of a an artist before his canvas.

471
00:26:54,974 --> 00:26:56,580
Rym: I mean look at like old comic books.

472
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,083
Rym: They they were.

473
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:58,392
Rym: I mean they were fighting comic books.

474
00:26:58,412 --> 00:26:59,540
Rym: They weren't gonna put him in the museum.

475
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:04,700
Scott: At least nowadays we seem to have mostly at least not completely but mostly learn the lesson.

476
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,790
Scott: You know people are already trying to save the video game.

477
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:11,966
Emily: Well and and with the digital society Preservation is a lot easier.

478
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:13,149
Emily: Whereas back.

479
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,494
Scott: It's not as easy as you think.

480
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:30,049
Rym: it seems easier in the short term But in the long term it is much more difficult Mental effort and expertise but it doesn't require as much physical space and investment like film You know unrolling it in those long tubes.

481
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,551
Emily: Yeah.

482
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:32,820
Scott: Anyway, sometimes let's talk about this movie.

483
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:58,489
Emily: Oh, yes, okay, but part of the thing talking about Roger Rabbit is very difficult If you leave out talking about animation history because what the movie is I mean on the surface level it functions as a really fun Mystery movie like, you know is definitely in the style of old black and white film noir Alcoholic hero who's kind of down and out.

484
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,562
Rym: and I have this with a lot like, you know project echo and a lot of things I've seen.

485
00:28:01,622 --> 00:28:02,507
Rym: I thought like.

486
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:04,579
Rym: as a kid I didn't quite get that they were comedies.

487
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:09,460
Rym: They had funny moments, but I took him kind of straight up at face value and Roger Rabbit was the same way.

488
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:16,384
Rym: I remember just getting into it as a mystery movie and it didn't really dawn on me that this was Partly a comedy.

489
00:28:16,465 --> 00:28:19,840
Scott: I mean, I didn't completely understand it, you know, and I was very young.

490
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,760
Rym: I didn't get any of those jokes about Jack Daniels.

491
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:22,647
Scott: I mean, yeah, there was.

492
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,420
Scott: so there's so many stuff in there.

493
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,604
Scott: That reminds me a lot of the same stuff that Powerpuff Girls used to do where you would tell dirty jokes But kids wouldn't get them.

494
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:33,700
Emily: Yeah, it's like all the all the more adult stuff.

495
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:36,881
Scott: It's like it's just right in there and so obvious It's.

496
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:42,380
Emily: it's called dual address and I learned about this in one of my classes when we were talking about Aladdin.

497
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:58,960
Emily: But dual address is when you have a thing that speaks to both children and adults But on different levels like when mojo Jojo was in jail and this big really big guy standing next to prison rape always the your go-to example.

498
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:03,285
Emily: What's the one?

499
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:04,329
Emily: Liberty Meadows?

500
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:15,074
Emily: it's like that guy, you know And luckily he ended up going into independent comics so he could draw the big-titted women He wanted without having to worry about newspaper censors.

501
00:29:15,094 --> 00:29:16,119
Scott: He draws a fine.

502
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,833
Emily: He's really really good as

503
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:22,465
Scott: opposed to some of those fantasy artists Just

504
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:23,799
Rym: the woman straddling a story.

505
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:30,666
Emily: Anyway, like Frank Cho back when he was doing newspaper comics He'd always try to slip things in.

506
00:29:30,706 --> 00:29:42,880
Emily: you know that were this strip was supposedly family-friendly, but sometimes it would get a little secretly raunchy, you know, but With with Roger Rabbit, it's funny.

507
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:53,620
Emily: Like I said, the dip was just one thing that I didn't understand because it was animation lingo And I thought it was just scary like some sort of scary acid.

508
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,360
Emily: Well, that's what I thought too, and I'm freaked out by acid scenes.

509
00:29:57,501 --> 00:30:00,594
Emily: Anyway, I like good they killed us the poor shoe.

510
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:01,538
Rym: poor shoe didn't?

511
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,740
Scott: he was All right, we got to do a photoshop for that scene where it's crevo shoe that goes in the dip.

512
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,511
Rym: I'd feel too bad.

513
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:10,400
Rym: They're so rare.

514
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:15,139
Scott: Over and over again you get infinite crevo shoes.

515
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:20,923
Rym: So I'm gonna assume we don't really need to worry about spoilers because the movie came out in 1988.

516
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:22,857
Scott: Yeah, seriously, if you haven't watched it like what the hell?

517
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,380
Rym: I if you have not seen this movie God and watch it right now and then come back and listen to the rest of this.

518
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,153
Rym: Definitely you're about the 37 ish minute mark.

519
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:30,796
Rym: Yeah.

520
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:37,720
Emily: Yeah, but Some of the things that I always thought were really weird when I was a little kid and I mean, they're still really weird.

521
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:45,068
Emily: But the fact that the femme fatale is like married to Roger It's just kind of inexplicable.

522
00:30:45,128 --> 00:30:49,045
Emily: but like, you know you expect You know, mrs.

523
00:30:49,145 --> 00:30:51,855
Emily: Rabbit to be a rabbit and she's not a rabbit.

524
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:56,970
Emily: She's a very Alluring cartoon songstress.

525
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,924
Rym: I do love that scene where he's sitting there and he's all like Rabbit whatever.

526
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:03,694
Rym: then she comes out and he just kind of jaw drops.

527
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:12,652
Emily: Yeah But Patty cake scene Play in patty cake and they're actually playing.

528
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:15,240
Rym: I like how they animate the patty cake with the pictures.

529
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:16,855
Rym: I wonder if that was very much intentional.

530
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:21,709
Rym: I'm sure Come on you well well except for what was that scene?

531
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:22,030
Rym: Emily?

532
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,940
Rym: you were telling us about where he was looking at the wrong place.

533
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,030
Emily: That was funny.

534
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:33,020
Emily: that um Animation aside there's this book by Richard Williams called the animators survival kit.

535
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,634
Emily: And if you want to get into animation at all, that's like your primer.

536
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:38,180
Emily: That's the number one textbook.

537
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,942
Emily: you should get it.

538
00:31:39,223 --> 00:31:46,442
Emily: it covers all the basics and he also has some really funny anecdotes because Richard Williams was the animation director on Roger rabbit.

539
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:51,474
Emily: and there's this one scene where the the actor who played.

540
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:52,777
Emily: what's the main character's name?

541
00:31:52,837 --> 00:32:16,328
Emily: I forget but he was very good at maintaining the imagined eye contact with the cartoon because what they do is they'd film the actors and then This Print out every frame of the movie and then the animators would animate over it and then they'd photograph it like a background With a cell overlay like an animated film.

542
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,658
Rym: What's interesting is how like it really holds up.

543
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:26,400
Scott: Yeah In some ways like it's like whoa, that's you know, that's pretty good skills even for today, right?

544
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,332
Scott: Like in the scene we're like like Jessica.

545
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:35,539
Scott: I was pulling on his tie You know, yeah, it's pretty good Little mechanical gadgets and stuff like.

546
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:37,762
Scott: Like.

547
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:43,240
Scott: there was the scene where all the weasels bust into his office and this is his guns that are just comically floating around.

548
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:43,603
Scott: It's like.

549
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:45,439
Scott: did you like, you know take a sleep?

550
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:49,748
Scott: It was not as good as I mean.

551
00:32:49,769 --> 00:33:01,659
Scott: overall the movie looks better than a lot of CG movies And I mean and while there were plenty of other movies before and since that have done the animation live-action combination It's like nobody's really done the same.

552
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:03,706
Scott: You know kind no one's done it.

553
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:05,673
Rym: Well cool world was like another attempt.

554
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:06,637
Rym: That doesn't really hold up.

555
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:08,927
Emily: No, no I've seen clips of cool world.

556
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,698
Emily: I didn't actually see it because my parents saw it and they were like It's okay.

557
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:16,543
Rym: But as a kid, I kind of want to watch it again because Brad Pitt's a really good actor It's.

558
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,218
Rym: I imagine he's really good in it.

559
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:21,938
Emily: Ralph Bakshi for me is really hot and cold like some of back.

560
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:26,479
Emily: She's stuff I like and some of it is just like really I don't know.

561
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:30,005
Emily: Smutty for the sake of being smutty I don't know.

562
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:31,192
Emily: Sometimes back.

563
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:35,844
Emily: She's stuff is kind of Lassie Nowadays, right?

564
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:38,600
Scott: I'm seeing a trend of like this sort of opposite, right?

565
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:45,240
Scott: Like I saw this trailer when I went to see Tron for this like Disney's Mars needs moms and it was like God.

566
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,953
Scott: It was like real people but in a whole CG animated world.

567
00:33:49,014 --> 00:33:52,767
Scott: No, I guess that backwards people It looks like real motion capture.

568
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:54,996
Emily: I can't believe you thought those were real people.

569
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:55,999
Emily: I know they're creepy.

570
00:33:56,622 --> 00:34:03,779
Scott: It looked like real people like at least real faces were used, you know for the Maybe you've made it past the uncanny valley and the rest of us have it.

571
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,660
Scott: But it said it was from the directors or the people who made Polar Express.

572
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,335
Scott: It wasn't Polar Express the same thing.

573
00:34:09,376 --> 00:34:24,210
Emily: where it was Polar Express was like all animation and weird-looking It is Tom Hanks Mars needs moms is the exact same process the exact same Producers and actually strange as it is.

574
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,299
Emily: I believe it's the mekis, right?

575
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:27,641
Emily: Who did it?

576
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:30,110
Emily: it wasn't he involved with Roger Rabbit?

577
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:30,371
Emily: Yeah.

578
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:32,300
Rym: He was the director of the live-action part.

579
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:44,652
Emily: Yeah, so he's still around making you know live-action animation kind of Combinations, but they're not as cool and they're really creepy and strange.

580
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,260
Rym: But anyway, there's the scene that we were talking about.

581
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,465
Emily: Yeah, so anyway The the lead actor.

582
00:34:51,806 --> 00:35:04,313
Emily: he was supposed to be making eye contact with Roger Rabbit who was shorter than he was but he he screwed up and they didn't catch it until they had sent the Footage over to the animation department.

583
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:05,320
Emily: They're like damn.

584
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:06,185
Emily: This is gonna.

585
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:11,605
Emily: Roger has to be up in the air if we're gonna have Eye contact in this scene.

586
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:16,180
Emily: So they like stretched him out against the wall like on his tippy toes for no reason.

587
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,200
Emily: They're like, well, he's neurotic it might work.

588
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,300
Emily: And so there's this one scene where Rogers just like inching up the wall and you're like, what is he doing?

589
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,952
Emily: But it was because they had a had a mistake.

590
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:40,219
Rym: They had to cover up so various little things But you don't notice it unless you know about him, you know, so they got Bob Hoskins to play Eddie Valiant But apparently, you know, the number one choice was Harrison Ford really just couldn't afford it.

591
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,015
Rym: Well, actually I think Bill Murray too, but he didn't respond.

592
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:51,266
Rym: I Think the casting worked out really well, I think I mean Eddie Valiant was a good character Yeah, though being an adult.

593
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:57,049
Rym: I did not notice how much they hammer down the point that he is an alcoholic He is drinking.

594
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,306
Scott: I didn't notice that at all until the most recent viewing.

595
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:10,526
Scott: I didn't notice that and it wasn't until two viewings ago after learning about it in college that I realized that it was about, you know, the you know, the All the cloverly thing.

596
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:13,780
Scott: Yeah the conspiracy to get rid of all the trains and the buses, right?

597
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,289
Scott: Because that's something that really happened, right?

598
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:17,353
Scott: I didn't know about that.

599
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:19,480
Scott: They bought all the streetcar.

600
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:25,924
Scott: That's the reason that we don't have trolleys, you know, except for tourist reasons in this country anymore is because you know GM whoever.

601
00:36:25,944 --> 00:36:26,999
Scott: they bought all of them.

602
00:36:27,304 --> 00:36:36,426
Scott: They shut them down They replaced them with buses and they purposefully made bus schedules shitty with shitty routes so that everyone would buy a car And that's why the United States is full of cars.

603
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:46,917
Rym: What's funny is think about the nice subtle social commentary of the crazy guy at the end Kind of avoiding spoilers, I guess who's like imagine it's a road with people driving a freeway.

604
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:48,120
Rym: I'll call it a freeway.

605
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:50,587
Emily: Well, the funniest value is like you're crazy.

606
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:55,504
Scott: Well, yeah, there's multiple scenes where they show him using the streetcar kids sitting on the back Of it.

607
00:36:55,584 --> 00:37:03,220
Rym: Yeah and all that kind of stuff to show you like, you know, they Also notice how he gets a cigarette from that like 13 year old kid.

608
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:10,896
Emily: Also, it's kind of funny too because you know The evil guy is trying to make freeways and you realize it's set in LA.

609
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:18,020
Emily: so Everybody in LA hates the freeways because they're they're insane.

610
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:22,538
Scott: I mean Los Angeles, but everyone there is but everyone there drives.

611
00:37:22,598 --> 00:37:26,560
Scott: and yeah A lot of LA people comes in New York insist on driving even if the subways.

612
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:27,183
Scott: Well, there's.

613
00:37:27,364 --> 00:37:29,454
Emily: there's no alternatives in LA.

614
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:32,273
Emily: They don't have a Bus subway system.

615
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,191
Emily: They got rid of it thing Exactly.

616
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:36,957
Emily: and that's what the subplot of this movie is about.

617
00:37:37,397 --> 00:37:48,324
Emily: It's about animation history It's a film noir and it's also social commentary about the history And I I like.

618
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:57,547
Emily: I like some of the Film noir tropes like some of the the lines where this is like Eddie Is that a rabbit in your pocket?

619
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:59,735
Emily: or are you just happy to see me instead of?

620
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:01,160
Emily: is that a gun in your pocket?

621
00:38:01,804 --> 00:38:08,598
Rym: One of my favorite scenes is just that little shave and a haircut Do and they can't not do it.

622
00:38:09,522 --> 00:38:14,397
Rym: It was really fun to watch was the Angry Video Game Nerd Cinematica review of Roger Rabbit.

623
00:38:14,437 --> 00:38:15,260
Rym: That's what reminded me.

624
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:17,127
Emily: I didn't see that.

625
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:22,570
Scott: I only saw his review of the game because I was oh my god I actually played the game before I ever saw the movie.

626
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,796
Emily: Did you call the phone number?

627
00:38:23,816 --> 00:38:27,316
Rym: No Well, the phone number now goes to a sex line.

628
00:38:27,357 --> 00:38:30,720
Scott: No kidding I played the game with like a feck, you know, and it just went today.

629
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,674
Rym: I tried to play the game legit as a result.

630
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:33,439
Rym: I never beat it.

631
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:36,579
Scott: Yeah, I just played it with it with the fact that I happen to have you know.

632
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:38,389
Rym: Also, it was weird that as a kid.

633
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:45,600
Rym: I remembered like really not Understanding how they got Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and Daffy Duck.

634
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,829
Scott: I didn't understand how they did that either when I was a kid.

635
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:48,391
Rym: I remember as a kid.

636
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:49,897
Rym: I was like so did it like?

637
00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:50,760
Rym: who made this movie?

638
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:54,889
Emily: So what's the story behind that?

639
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:56,857
Emily: I actually don't know that aspect.

640
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,543
Emily: how they got Amazed me.

641
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:00,588
Rym: I don't know.

642
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:03,020
Rym: I'm like reading through IMDb in the Wikipedia.

643
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:05,669
Scott: So you still don't know you didn't?

644
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:07,600
Scott: you just tried to mention it without looking it up before.

645
00:39:07,802 --> 00:39:09,420
Rym: I mean, I thought it was awesome like as a kid.

646
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,366
Rym: It really stood out.

647
00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:12,520
Rym: that like Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.

648
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:15,560
Scott: It makes me wonder like how come people can't figure this shit out?

649
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:25,900
Rym: Well, the best I can see is that you know They got Spielberg to do all this stuff and they basically they went into this movie thinking All right, this is our chance to make a super blockbuster.

650
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:27,946
Scott: Well, it wasn't a super block.

651
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,392
Rym: Well, they wanted it to be.

652
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,200
Emily: did they have to pay for the rights?

653
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,505
Emily: So did they get permission?

654
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:39,396
Emily: I mean, I understand that there must have been you know Some sort of legal powwow going on between the companies.

655
00:39:39,536 --> 00:39:41,102
Rym: all the legal stuff I can find.

656
00:39:41,283 --> 00:39:45,938
Rym: talk about the sequel that didn't happen and not paying the guy who wrote the book.

657
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:48,559
Emily: Yeah I was gonna say did you know it was based on a book?

658
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,028
Rym: Yeah, Gary K Wolf right never heard of.

659
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:53,833
Scott: so the book came first, yep.

660
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,338
Scott: Wow, what's the book?

661
00:39:55,378 --> 00:39:56,020
Scott: the same story?

662
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,824
Emily: No, it's actually really different.

663
00:39:57,884 --> 00:39:58,686
Emily: I haven't read it.

664
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:00,190
Emily: But I mean it.

665
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:02,637
Emily: it plays out like a mystery.

666
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:12,209
Emily: It's you know 1940s 1930s era and Other than that, I really don't know.

667
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,282
Emily: apparently it's a very strange book There.

668
00:40:15,904 --> 00:40:25,226
Emily: but one point though Mickey Mouse kind of a dick, oh they're optics when The worst one is Tweety.

669
00:40:25,587 --> 00:40:29,440
Emily: and Tweety I hate in the cartoons too, but Tweety when he's like

670
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:43,440
Scott: You know people you don't think about it too much when you're watching a lot of the old You know cartoons because some of them right give you a reason for someone to get the shit kicked out of them.

671
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,460
Scott: Like the you know, Wile E. Coyote doesn't fall off the cliff until he's trying to eat the roadrunner.

672
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:50,289
Emily: Yeah, it's kind of like karmic bugs buddies.

673
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:53,880
Scott: only, you know, most of the time is like Elmer Fudd tries to shoot him first.

674
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,829
Rym: Yeah, sometimes he just finds sometimes tortures.

675
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:57,611
Scott: Sometimes.

676
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:01,187
Scott: He's just an asshole but like for no reason I don't know.

677
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:08,460
Emily: most of the time with bugs It's like they cross him one time and then he spends the rest of the episode extracting his revenge, right?

678
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,589
Scott: But I mean sometimes they don't even cross him at all.

679
00:41:10,649 --> 00:41:12,558
Scott: Sometimes it's just like oh you're singing opera.

680
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:16,700
Rym: All right Torture you have to death the the opera singer.

681
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,949
Emily: He hit him with the thing and and then bugs is always like.

682
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:23,700
Emily: this means war and then that happens sometimes.

683
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,199
Rym: Somebody should have just called the police and been like this guy hit me.

684
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:41,559
Emily: There were a couple with the with the thugs weren't there.

685
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:43,540
Scott: There was the one where he's hiding in the stove.

686
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,128
Rym: He's done it, but I know he's done it.

687
00:41:46,148 --> 00:41:48,780
Emily: That's the other one and the the one where they're in the factory.

688
00:41:48,962 --> 00:41:49,733
Emily: Is that that one?

689
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:53,191
Scott: Yeah There's one there in the house on the cliff and one there in the.

690
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:54,920
Scott: they're in a factory or something.

691
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,414
Emily: You know, which one I want to find again is the one where?

692
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,940
Emily: There's the dog who falls in love with the lawn ornament dog and then she gets turned into a bomb.

693
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,486
Rym: You don't remember that one.

694
00:42:07,546 --> 00:42:10,819
Emily: It was one of those wartime cartoons and they used to play it on the cartoon.

695
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:37,099
Emily: now Vaguely Show the assembly line making a bomb and this lawn ornament dog gets melted down to be a missile anyway, so Roger rabbit like the end scenes are when the animators talent really shines through Where you've got so many different kinds of characters from all from the golden era of a lot

696
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:37,300
Rym: of them.

697
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,257
Rym: I didn't even recognize some of them like.

698
00:42:40,378 --> 00:42:42,584
Rym: I saw some Looking stuff.

699
00:42:42,664 --> 00:42:43,970
Scott: Yeah, I saw some stuff.

700
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,217
Scott: I didn't recognize like a weird cow, but there was some stuff I totally recognized like the totally hot harp.

701
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:56,120
Emily: I was like He was like, yeah, it's the harp but we're like you got a thing for that heart who doesn't have a thing for the heart.

702
00:42:56,586 --> 00:42:59,267
Scott: Hey guys, that's who That's right.

703
00:42:59,388 --> 00:42:59,651
Emily: Yep.

704
00:42:59,752 --> 00:43:00,500
Emily: That's that harp.

705
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,075
Rym: Anyway, so currently they sell Charles Fleischer who did the voice of Roger rabbit.

706
00:43:05,436 --> 00:43:08,500
Rym: for many of the scenes He would just dress up in a rabbit costume.

707
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:12,831
Rym: Just kind of bothering people.

708
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:14,636
Scott: and you hear my joke about the heart playing with it.

709
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:15,779
Rym: I'd love to see a video of that.

710
00:43:16,565 --> 00:43:27,495
Emily: Tell us watching the heart play with and they had like the Some really early stuff like the the trees flowers in the trees.

711
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:28,840
Scott: Yeah, I never seen them.

712
00:43:29,581 --> 00:43:30,043
Emily: I've seen.

713
00:43:30,063 --> 00:43:32,655
Emily: I actually may not have seen it either.

714
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:35,808
Emily: I Know I've seen tons of clips of it.

715
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,919
Emily: So I recognized it, but I'm not sure if I've seen the whole thing.

716
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:54,745
Scott: but yeah, it's like there's this whole big parade of like hundred probably cartoon characters and Just because they're not really in it that much and I think that's part of the reason why you know It was allowed right?

717
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:57,900
Scott: Yeah to be in there is because like there they weren't like playing major roles.

718
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:00,559
Scott: It was like, you know, you could have even almost called it fair use.

719
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,146
Scott: They were in there for such a small.

720
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:05,339
Rym: It was definitely homage and not anything more direct.

721
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,363
Emily: Yeah Well, it's like.

722
00:44:06,423 --> 00:44:19,480
Emily: none of the main characters were established cartoon characters, but they were very much based in The tradition of these cartoon characters like, you know, Roger rabbit has a lot of what's his name woody the woodpecker or whatever.

723
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:28,351
Emily: Yeah, kind of annoying Madcap adventures sort of personality A little bit of bugs, but he doesn't have.

724
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:29,895
Emily: he's a lot more wacky.

725
00:44:29,976 --> 00:44:33,674
Emily: He doesn't have that kind of sardonic goofiness about him.

726
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,496
Rym: but There I mean it was a solid plot.

727
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:39,120
Rym: It's a great movie.

728
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,171
Rym: I love the opening cartoon and how it segues right into the.

729
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,420
Emily: oh, yeah, and people don't realize.

730
00:44:45,022 --> 00:44:50,340
Emily: One cool thing about the opening cartoon that actually killed a lot of the budget for the movie

731
00:44:51,062 --> 00:44:51,105
Scott: Is

732
00:44:54,646 --> 00:45:08,460
Emily: If you actually look at it, it's like It's a nod to the old cartoons But it's got a lot of polish on it that an old Warner Brothers cartoon wouldn't have like those reflections in the floor and there's crazy like.

733
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:19,778
Rym: Either loved it that they got to work on something so awesome or hated it because they had to draw like.

734
00:45:19,798 --> 00:45:29,331
Scott: that is like I think animators like it when they're given free rein to do Like a lot of animation in my days from many countries.

735
00:45:29,391 --> 00:45:36,659
Scott: and it's like, you know in terms of the stuff that is done by hand It's like I guess Akira is better than that, but not much else.

736
00:45:37,582 --> 00:45:38,405
Scott: Just the quality

737
00:45:38,425 --> 00:46:04,515
Emily: just really showcases the potential of animation for crazy exaggeration like, you know, there's just a lot of You know crazy for shortening and squashing and stretching and all these dynamic effects which so just by showing you and reminding you this is what animation can do and then Putting these characters in the real world where these things don't necessarily apply.

738
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:06,020
Emily: It kind of highlights the differences.

739
00:46:06,702 --> 00:46:07,785
Rym: Oh, I didn't even know this.

740
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:08,468
Rym: Mel Blanc.

741
00:46:08,628 --> 00:46:08,969
Rym: Actually.

742
00:46:09,009 --> 00:46:10,434
Rym: This was the last film he worked on.

743
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:15,838
Rym: he did the voices of all his characters No kidding in the movie And then he died the next year.

744
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:18,485
Rym: He didn't do Daffy Duck.

745
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,392
Rym: Apparently that was too physically exerting to do.

746
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:20,493
Rym: Yeah.

747
00:46:20,754 --> 00:46:22,360
Rym: Yeah, which makes sense.

748
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:29,944
Emily: I like yeah, but there's like those scenes like there was Daffy Duck and Donald Duck playing the piano back to back.

749
00:46:29,964 --> 00:46:40,380
Emily: that scene is brilliant and they're like bitching at each other and the Daffy's like I. I can't understand what this guy's saying, you know There's a lot of weird little scenes.

750
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,266
Rym: I forgot about that.

751
00:46:41,306 --> 00:46:45,430
Rym: I'd kind of Suddenly remembered when we watch it again like all these littlest odds were cartoon characters.

752
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:48,150
Rym: They're just doing stuff in the background stuff in the background, right?

753
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:55,350
Emily: And like, you know, you'll walk outside the studio and then Dumbo flies across and the best thing is he works for peanuts.

754
00:46:57,772 --> 00:46:59,349
Emily: But this is pretty good.

755
00:46:59,813 --> 00:47:00,700
Emily: I I really do.

756
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:08,729
Emily: it's not my favorite movie But I really do like that movie and it's one of those films that I get really nostalgic about kind of like.

757
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:09,230
Scott: I think it.

758
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,568
Scott: You know, I think it's sort of been kind of forgotten.

759
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:11,970
Scott: ish Like.

760
00:47:11,991 --> 00:47:15,530
Scott: it hasn't been completely forgotten, but it's not something that people think about often.

761
00:47:15,992 --> 00:47:17,337
Scott: You know, is it like?

762
00:47:17,457 --> 00:47:20,850
Scott: it was popular at the time popular enough to get a Nintendo game even.

763
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:24,650
Rym: But it's the highest grossing animated film ever in the world.

764
00:47:24,694 --> 00:47:34,677
Scott: Yeah But then you know It's sort of faded Afterwards and it never really came back up or was reminded of or had any you know, big Merchandising or any of these.

765
00:47:34,697 --> 00:47:36,063
Rym: there was a lot of talk.

766
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:43,090
Scott: They tried to make sequels and they all fell through Things like you know, like Aladdin we mentioned earlier right like Aladdin had a TV series at one point.

767
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:45,830
Rym: I like three direct-to-TV DVD

768
00:47:47,091 --> 00:47:49,033
Emily: movies do like Like

769
00:47:49,053 --> 00:48:01,995
Scott: a lot of these a lot of these other animated properties have these long tails and even you know Pretty much any huge movie sort of has a long tail to it either in the form of sequels or books or merchants or saw You know something right.

770
00:48:02,035 --> 00:48:05,550
Scott: these big successful properties have long tails, but Roger Rabbit had no long tail.

771
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:10,312
Scott: Rabbit and the end Done.

772
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:10,895
Emily: He's a rabbit.

773
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:11,778
Emily: He has a short tail.

774
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:18,350
Scott: All right, but you know, so because of that, you know I mean people remember it exists, but I mean it was from the late 80s.

775
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:26,528
Scott: So a lot of people who are way younger than us never even saw it ever Right, man, even though it exists at all Yeah, and then even people, you know, if they didn't see it then they might.

776
00:48:26,548 --> 00:48:32,010
Scott: you might say Oh, yeah, that was that thing that was animated and also live-action and that's all they remember.

777
00:48:32,311 --> 00:48:44,970
Emily: Well at the same time maybe it's just the crowd I run with but I think that one people who have an interest in Like I don't know cinema history like the the famous movies over time.

778
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:53,170
Emily: That's one that's remembered kind of like Star Wars is remembered for for both technical expertise and that it did something different.

779
00:48:53,832 --> 00:49:06,188
Emily: I mean other movies had combined live-action and animation before but not nearly to the effect you know to the with the quality that Roger Rabbit was able to achieve.

780
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:11,930
Emily: and Also, I think it's partly because I hang around with animators and they're always like gushing about Roger Rabbit.

781
00:49:12,192 --> 00:49:18,641
Scott: So not not everybody's forgotten this film Yeah, but it's not something that your people talk about just in normal.

782
00:49:18,781 --> 00:49:22,637
Rym: and though I think it's having a comeback just because after I Saw the Cinemasker thing.

783
00:49:22,677 --> 00:49:23,945
Rym: I was like, oh I should watch this.

784
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:24,529
Rym: I didn't have it.

785
00:49:24,951 --> 00:49:29,910
Rym: So, of course BitTorrent because it's not in the Netflix streaming and there were a ton of people seeding it.

786
00:49:30,171 --> 00:49:33,666
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if it was due to that or just people are always seeding it.

787
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:35,229
Emily: Yeah I don't know.

788
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:47,894
Emily: I think a lot of stuff from the 80s and early 90s is starting to come back on a nostalgia wave, you know You know, we went through.

789
00:49:47,934 --> 00:49:54,080
Scott: he met Ninja Turtles and Voltron rice and I were coming up to the later and soon the 90s stuff Will be come back again.

790
00:49:54,403 --> 00:49:56,797
Scott: Yeah Ninja Turtles is actually.

791
00:49:56,817 --> 00:49:59,090
Emily: I wonder if they'll have Captain Planet.

792
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:03,974
Scott: That's already Really.

793
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:06,750
Emily: that's what I remembered from my my little day.

794
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,365
Rym: Well, there's the new My Little Pony's show that apparently supposedly really good.

795
00:50:10,646 --> 00:50:11,650
Emily: I saw part of it.

796
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:14,290
Emily: It really reminds me of those old cartoon cartoons.

797
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:22,190
Scott: It definitely does because like it's done by Craig McCracken's wife who worked on Powerpuff Girls and some other shows make sense.

798
00:50:22,755 --> 00:50:24,650
Scott: It's a. it's a Cartoon Network kind of thing.

799
00:50:24,991 --> 00:50:28,621
Emily: You know the the character designs just the general dynamic of the show.

800
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:31,709
Emily: it feels like those 90s cartoons is very fun.

801
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:37,550
Scott: But anyway, see if you haven't seen it You should probably go see Roger Rabbit.

802
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:41,406
Rym: If you've decided to keep listening to the show and haven't seen it yet go see it.

803
00:50:41,627 --> 00:50:42,450
Rym: there are worse movies.

804
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,314
Rym: You could say definitely a lot worse movies.

805
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:45,817
