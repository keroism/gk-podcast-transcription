00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,507
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 11th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,507 --> 00:00:10,749
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:13,455
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,208
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,140
Rym: Tonight, how we got into all this stuff.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,558
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,129
Scott: So a couple days ago, biking over the bridge.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,448
Rym: Biking over the bridge like you do.

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,010
Scott: Coming over here, and I see this guy on a bike.

10
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:37,270
Scott: And it's a normal bike with two wheels, pedals, seat, handlebars.

11
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,870
Rym: And clearly some other factor.

12
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:47,030
Scott: The seats and handlebars were like at least six or seven feet off the ground.

13
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:51,589
Scott: And I'm like, look at this fucking hipster.

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,790
Rym: So it wasn't a bike with one really big wheel and one really tiny wheel.

15
00:00:57,052 --> 00:00:57,294
Scott: Nope.

16
00:00:57,718 --> 00:00:58,849
Scott: It was a perfectly normal bike.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,230
Scott: It just happened to be that the seat and handlebars and I guess pedals were elevated.

18
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,448
Scott: You know, it was basically a very tall frame, you know.

19
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:10,630
Rym: I'd be worried I'd hit my head on that bridge.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,179
Scott: I also would, but I guess he didn't.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,549
Scott: I don't know how he got on the bike to begin with.

22
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,268
Scott: But I was like, look at this fucking hipster.

23
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,610
Scott: And I wanted to take a picture and put him on that website.

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,750
Scott: Look at this fucking hipster.

25
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:24,548
Scott: But I was biking, so now...

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,070
Rym: Now why is it that someone like that is now a hipster?

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,049
Rym: When at RIT, someone like that was just a guy.

28
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,330
Rym: Because there were people who did crap like that.

29
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,950
Scott: No, they had unicycles, which were normal.

30
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:39,830
Rym: Ah, they also, apparently now, there's that picture of that weird ass cow bike.

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,094
Scott: Cow bike?

32
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:42,510
Scott: Oh yeah, that's art.

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,910
Rym: Is it art or is it a hipster?

34
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,366
Rym: It's art.

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,468
Rym: Hipster or art?

36
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:54,670
Scott: The point is, now I'm thinking, right, I gotta get one of those, you know, sporty, wearing your helmet camera things.

37
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,490
Scott: Whatever.

38
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:56,629
Rym: They're not that expensive.

39
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,490
Scott: No, but what's the one that the guy was wearing when he accidentally fell off the mountain and survived?

40
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,250
Rym: Oh, I don't remember offhand.

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,450
Scott: Because all the videos you see with that one are like ultra HD awesome.

42
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,750
Rym: I saw a lot of people when I was skiing, right?

43
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,510
Rym: They had flip cameras and they had things designed to hold a flip camera on their helmets.

44
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,269
Scott: I don't want to do that.

45
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:16,230
Scott: I want one of the ones that's designed to do that.

46
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,309
Scott: And I don't want it to look dorky.

47
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,830
Scott: It's gotta be, you know, it can't be like sticking out like an antenna.

48
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,290
Scott: It's gotta be, you know, normal.

49
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,070
Rym: See, I don't know.

50
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,310
Rym: I thought it'd be cool in one way, but at the same time, I don't mountain bike anymore.

51
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,130
Rym: So what are you gonna see?

52
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,690
Rym: You're gonna see the same thing a car sees when it goes around New York.

53
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,688
Scott: Well, no, but the point is, you actually see a lot more than what a car sees because you don't have a roof, right?

54
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,090
Scott: So you have a much wider angle of view in general, even though a camera has a less angle of view than my eyeballs.

55
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,050
Rym: But I'm saying in terms of me biking to work, you're gonna see what a car sees.

56
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,450
Scott: Right, but basically what you'll do is, you know, I'll just leave it on whenever I'm biking around.

57
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:51,650
Rym: Oh, and then if something happens, you go back.

58
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,310
Scott: And if something happens, like look at this fucking hipster, then when I get home, I'll just edit that out and put it on YouTube and delete everything else on the camera.

59
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,344
Scott: I'm not gonna, you know, make a video of going to work.

60
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:01,130
Scott: That's boring as hell.

61
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:03,669
Rym: Not a bad idea.

62
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,547
Scott: Yeah, plus I can make videos like, "Look, this is how to get on the secret

63
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:09,069
Scott: stairs.".

64
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:11,430
Rym: I heard you finally found the secret stairs.

65
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,410
Scott: I found the secret stairs.

66
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,090
Rym: You see how they're kind of not obvious.

67
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,634
Scott: Incredibly not obvious.

68
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:19,250
Scott: There's no one even anywhere near them, which I don't think anyone uses them, which is why they're...

69
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,610
Rym: I've never seen someone going in, but I've seen many people coming out as I was coming out.

70
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:24,849
Scott: No, I'm going in.

71
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:27,277
Rym: When am I gonna be able to go in?

72
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:30,070
Rym: This weekend we're playing diplomacy and then I'm going to Spotcastle.

73
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:31,670
Scott: I might go this weekend.

74
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,075
Scott: Oh.

75
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,930
Scott: 'Cause I'm definitely not going next weekend.

76
00:03:35,152 --> 00:03:35,777
Scott: No chance.

77
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:37,289
Scott: Maybe the weekend after that I could go again.

78
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,050
Rym: What is next weekend?

79
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:38,843
Scott: What?

80
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:39,550
Rym: Alright, bar camp.

81
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,050
Scott: Bar camp and also library overnight.

82
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:43,572
Scott: Yeah.

83
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:46,530
Rym: Come on, you can fit it in between the library and the bar camp.

84
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:47,710
Scott: All two hours in between.

85
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,249
Rym: Two hours, you could make it over the RFK and back down.

86
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,090
Scott: Uh, from the library?

87
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:56,161
Rym: Go from the library.

88
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:56,769
Rym: Where's bar camp?

89
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,010
Scott: Uh, on 50-something on 6th Avenue?

90
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,869
Rym: I think in two hours you could go from the library, up...

91
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,670
Scott: After being up all night?

92
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,590
Rym: Yeah, over the RFK, back around, back to bar camp.

93
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,148
Scott: Yeah, no.

94
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:17,649
Rym: One time when I was in high school, I had more than 48 hours of not sleeping because I had an all-night party after school.

95
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,390
Rym: Like a rollerblading all-night thing.

96
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:22,890
Rym: And then the next day at a Quiz Bowl tournament, like in the morning, that was all day.

97
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,429
Rym: And then that night, I went back to the school and we broke into the band director's office and painted it.

98
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:29,469
Rym: All night.

99
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:36,930
Rym: And then the next morning, as I was driving home, I ran a bunch of stop lights and then I fell asleep in my car, just parked on the street.

100
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:37,541
Rym: Yeah.

101
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,041
Rym: Yeah.

102
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,110
Scott: Well, the library thing does have a sleeping room, but it's only for power naps, apparently.

103
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:44,669
Scott: And, uh, yeah.

104
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,170
Rym: You're not gonna wanna sleep through that.

105
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,610
Scott: I might take the Friday off and sleep and wake up and go to the library.

106
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:49,873
Rym: Ahhh.

107
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:50,662
Scott: Anyway.

108
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:51,696
Rym: Anyway.

109
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,189
Rym: So, it's Wednesday.

110
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,990
Rym: Tons of anime news.

111
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,590
Rym: The industry is just abuzz with activity currently.

112
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,249
Scott: Oh, I'm sure.

113
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:10,930
Rym: So, I wanna talk a little bit about, you know, I think the only reason it's becoming popular in our forum, in that people are talking about it, is 'cause there's no ponies anymore.

114
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:20,250
Rym: I feel like ponies were drawing a lot of our forum's energy, and now that ponies are somewhat subsided temporarily, people are looking at other things.

115
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,110
Rym: They're trying to get their fix.

116
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,409
Rym: Well, I mean, I tried- Any way they can.

117
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,390
Scott: I mean, this pony energy, right?

118
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,070
Scott: It was so forceful and it had direction, right?

119
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:34,790
Scott: But now that the ponies have faded and it's going into another season, I tried to manually steer and funnel that energy in a different direction.

120
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,310
Scott: And the direction I attempted to steer it was the best direction, Hajime no Ippo.

121
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:40,279
Rym: Ahhh.

122
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:43,110
Scott: I have transferred my pony energies in that direction.

123
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:50,070
Rym: I have transferred mine into not consuming, like some people do, not simply watching what others have done, but making things myself.

124
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,068
Scott: I'm also making things.

125
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,250
Rym: While I'm behind on that pony video I've been working on for a while, it's almost done.

126
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:57,910
Rym: And that other pony thing is almost done.

127
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:00,089
Scott: Yeah, your pony energy has faded, huh?

128
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:01,749
Rym: Now, they actually are almost done.

129
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:02,650
Scott: Yeah, I have.

130
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,361
Scott: The first 90% takes 90% of the time, and the last 10% takes the other 90% of the time.

131
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,730
Rym: I have a third pony thing that interrupted them momentarily, and ConnectiCon.

132
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:18,710
Rym: But the third pony thing is actually really easy to make, and much like Kanie a Pony does not have to be good because the concept is it.

133
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,249
Scott: The Kanie a Pony was real good though.

134
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,222
Rym: Yeah, but that was minimum effort.

135
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,390
Rym: That was like BS effort.

136
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,048
Scott: That was pretty good.

137
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:24,978
Rym: Huh?

138
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:25,310
Rym: Well.

139
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,410
Scott: It was more well done than a lot of the videos out there.

140
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,070
Rym: Yeah, it's not saying that much though.

141
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,450
Rym: But I'm gonna mash up Fluttershy and the dragon.

142
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:33,330
Scott: Alright.

143
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,630
Rym: With my year with the dragon.

144
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:37,250
Rym: Good move.

145
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:37,637
Rym: Yeah.

146
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,470
Scott: You could also do Pete's Dragon.

147
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:43,150
Rym: Oh my god, I wanna watch Pete's Dragon and do a show on it now.

148
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,370
Scott: Or Puff the Magic Dragon.

149
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:44,750
Scott: Eh.

150
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:46,870
Scott: Or I am the last one.

151
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:51,510
Rym: You know, as much as I hated that movie, I loved that movie.

152
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:52,709
Scott: I know you loved that movie.

153
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,185
Rym: Yeah, because the movie was bad in every possible way.

154
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:57,390
Rym: The plot was bullshit.

155
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,290
Rym: But it had Sean Connery playing a dragon.

156
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,390
Scott: Usually the video, except instead of using either one of the two big dragons, do Spike or he's the last one.

157
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:13,963
Rym: So anyway, Wakfu is basically, I saw this forever.

158
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:16,350
Rym: There were ads and stuff about it.

159
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:21,350
Rym: It was one of those things where you'd see it and say wow, that's a thing that someone is trying to promote.

160
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,625
Scott: I thought it was a word that meant something like weeaboo or you know.

161
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:25,781
Scott: Really?

162
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,450
Scott: Yeah, I didn't know.

163
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:30,630
Rym: I remember just at PAX there'd be gigantic things about this.

164
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,210
Rym: It was like a turn-based tactical RPG MMO something.

165
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,909
Rym: And I'd see this crazy art and I remember always thinking wow, that reeks of effort and ignoring it.

166
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,880
Rym: Like just completely ignoring it.

167
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:44,050
Rym: I mean, I ignore most things.

168
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:50,730
Rym: It's not really a, I don't know, a complaint about a thing that I have ignored it because I have ignored the majority of things ever.

169
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:56,206
Rym: And apparently among all the media blitz there is a cartoon in France.

170
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,130
Rym: In French.

171
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,724
Rym: And I watched an episode of it.

172
00:07:58,764 --> 00:07:59,230
Rym: It was okay.

173
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,400
Scott: But isn't this like a Square Enix thing?

174
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,230
Scott: So why is the cartoon French?

175
00:08:04,513 --> 00:08:04,835
Rym: I don't know.

176
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:05,962
Rym: I don't know much about it.

177
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:07,110
Rym: But the cartoon is French.

178
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,567
Rym: I guess they outsourced it to France because France is where most of the good animation that isn't coming from.

179
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:13,449
Rym: Japan comes from.

180
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,240
Rym: And America obviously.

181
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,670
Rym: France is like big on the animation.

182
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:19,958
Rym: And the cartoon is actually kind of funny.

183
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,343
Rym: I don't know what I mean.

184
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:23,270
Rym: I'm not even going to geek bite it yet.

185
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,054
Rym: This is like a pre-geek bite.

186
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:31,610
Rym: It might fill my need to watch something on this level until ponies come back.

187
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,770
Rym: But it's not nearly as good as ponies.

188
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:33,643
Scott: Hajime no Ippo.

189
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:34,110
Scott: What the fuck?

190
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:35,328
Rym: I'm also watching that.

191
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,251
Scott: Alright.

192
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:38,688
Scott: You haven't even finished watching Okotoro Cat, have you?

193
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,815
Rym: I'm also watching that.

194
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:40,318
Rym: But you know what?

195
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,470
Rym: Unlike some people, I'm creating.

196
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:45,570
Scott: I'm also making things slowly.

197
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:46,970
Rym: Yeah, also slowly.

198
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,770
Scott: It's harder for me to make a program than it is for you to make a Kanye video.

199
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,467
Rym: Yeah, well I've been making programs too.

200
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,530
Scott: Yeah, you're not making the difficult programs I'm making.

201
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,207
Rym: Not yet, no.

202
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,276
Scott: Anyway, so.

203
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,382
Scott: Blackjack.

204
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:03,967
Scott: Everyone knows Blackjack.

205
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,110
Scott: If you don't, what the fuck?

206
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,670
Rym: You should watch some Blackjack.

207
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,724
Scott: And read some Blackjack.

208
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:08,009
Scott: But anyway.

209
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,950
Rym: If you like house, you'll like Blackjack.

210
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,090
Scott: Anyway, there's a Blackjack OAV, and it's ten episodes.

211
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:19,230
Scott: So ten separate VHS tapes or DVDs were released over the course of the years from 1993 to 2000.

212
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,558
Scott: So yeah, they're probably VHS tapes.

213
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,650
Scott: And it was one episode per tape, right?

214
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,389
Scott: But for now, they're going to release an eleventh and final OAV.

215
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,030
Scott: Ten years after volume ten, we're gonna get volume eleven.

216
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,353
Scott: Wow.

217
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,276
Scott: How about that?

218
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:34,010
Scott: That's crazy.

219
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,998
Rym: Was it done recently?

220
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,466
Rym: Was it like in a hopper?

221
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:38,169
Rym: Is it new?

222
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:45,470
Scott: No, it says the Blackjack original video anime series by the late Osamu Dezaki will get an eleventh and final volume more than a decade after the previous volume.

223
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:58,100
Scott: And the original voice actors for Blackjack and Pinocchio will reprise their roles, and they will record their lines during a live stream on Niko Nikodoga on Saturday, May 14th.

224
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,969
Rym: That's actually pretty cool.

225
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,694
Scott: Japan time, 1 a.m.

226
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:02,195
Scott: Eastern.

227
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:03,497
Scott: So if you're up at 1 a.m.

228
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:09,550
Scott: and you go to Niko Niko, you can watch the voice actors record the lines for this eleventh...

229
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,559
Rym: So I heard what happens in this episode, actually.

230
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,770
Rym: It resolves Princess Knight.

231
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,949
Rym: We gotta finish Astro Boy 80s, too, while we're at it.

232
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:21,769
Scott: It's a good one.

233
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,230
Rym: 'Cause we got most of the way through.

234
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,610
Scott: I forget what episode we were on then.

235
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:25,528
Rym: I don't even know.

236
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:30,410
Scott: We watched the one where there was a train in the wilderness with all the whole class of kids.

237
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,330
Rym: It went to the moon, all that stuff.

238
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,710
Scott: Was that the same one with the bees, or was the bees a different one?

239
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,210
Rym: The bees was before that, I think.

240
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:40,169
Scott: I can't, I don't know.

241
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,550
Rym: Let's pick a random, we should watch the end and go backwards.

242
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:44,770
Rym: That's the easiest way.

243
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,109
Scott: I think that's a bad idea, but yeah.

244
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:50,107
Rym: Or Hokodona can, I kinda just guess, 'cause I always think, "Oh, I just watched episode

245
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,274
Rym: 24.".

246
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:52,967
Rym: "I will remember this, and then the next day I

247
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:53,410
Rym: forget.".

248
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,896
Scott: Here's a secret of space.

249
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:58,190
Scott: Wikipedia has a list of episodes for pretty much every show.

250
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,049
Rym: You just go and find the synopsis and be like, "Oh, I remember

251
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,150
Rym: that.".

252
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:06,890
Scott: Yeah, so anytime there's a long show, I just go wiki, space, list of My Little Pony episodes, for example.

253
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,649
Scott: And then I look down the list and I find the episode that I'm on, and then I watch it.

254
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:14,847
Scott: It works really well for Hokodona can episodes, 'cause there's 150 of them.

255
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:15,510
Scott: Good luck remembering.

256
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,679
Rym: So things of the day.

257
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,320
Rym: This is not the greatest thing in and of itself.

258
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:35,600
Rym: The product, the thing, that is my thing of the day, is a cool concept, executed, I would say, the bare minimum required.

259
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,300
Rym: Like, this is the bottom of this kind of thing.

260
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:47,300
Rym: But I think there's going to be a huge wave of this, like in the next five, six years or so, in terms of active prosthetics.

261
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,419
Rym: Mostly for costumers, cosplayers, and furries.

262
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,240
Rym: Basically, they're, you know, Nekomimi, the cat ears that people wear on their head.

263
00:11:57,722 --> 00:11:59,050
Rym: But they're a little different.

264
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,277
Rym: They're robotic.

265
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:00,780
Rym: They move.

266
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,304
Rym: They move around.

267
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:05,940
Rym: They'll twitch, they'll go flat, they'll perk up, they'll turn at things.

268
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:09,500
Rym: But the way they do this isn't just random or with switches.

269
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,680
Rym: It actually has one of those kind of toy-level, shit-tier brainwave readers.

270
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:20,860
Scott: Does it really read your brainwaves, or does it just say it does and it just sort of does things randomly?

271
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,619
Rym: It's actually really easy to do that.

272
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:27,640
Rym: Like, remember that toy that I think Dorkly did, or not Dorkly, before Bleepboop?

273
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,320
Rym: They actually reviewed the Star Wars Force Trainer.

274
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,306
Scott: The Star Wars Force thing, yeah.

275
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,240
Scott: Isn't that just random and bullshit also?

276
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:33,561
Scott: No.

277
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:34,745
Rym: It's really easy.

278
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:39,360
Rym: I mean, basically you look for certain basic patterns in the overall brainwaves.

279
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,138
Rym: That sort of stuff is actually kind of easy to do.

280
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,779
Scott: Cos I remember, you remember back in the day there was a thing you could put on your finger that you were supposed to control the computer mouse with it?

281
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,509
Scott: That they was like, this was in the mid-90s.

282
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:55,400
Rym: The things that we use now that do that and actually work are based on the same principles.

283
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,760
Scott: I still have a hard time believing this principle isn't complete bullshit.

284
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,867
Rym: You're completely wrong.

285
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:02,660
Rym: Just absolutely.

286
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,120
Scott: There's no way that it can actually be precise enough to where you're actually consciously controlling something.

287
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,675
Rym: You're not consciously controlling them.

288
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:09,180
Rym: Here's the thing.

289
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:10,771
Rym: I said shit-tier.

290
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:11,740
Rym: This is the bottom type.

291
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,660
Rym: The Star Wars Force Trainer and things like that, they basically read the most overall frequencies.

292
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,427
Rym: Because it's pretty trivial.

293
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:23,080
Rym: We could very easily build equipment that could scan that level of brainwave.

294
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,455
Rym: You can tell if someone is excited, relaxed.

295
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:27,439
Rym: That's about it.

296
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:28,289
Scott: Uh-huh.

297
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:28,718
Scott: Yeah.

298
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,780
Rym: So basically what these things do is if your activity goes up at all, they perk up.

299
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,569
Rym: And if it goes down, they go flat.

300
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:39,460
Rym: And I don't know what causes them to twitch.

301
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,550
Rym: But it's kind of cute.

302
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:48,880
Rym: And while this is not the best product, I really think that there's going to be a big wave of active prosthetics within the next decade.

303
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:53,760
Scott: All I'm saying is I could make one that does things randomly and no one would be able to tell the difference.

304
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,360
Rym: At the same time, while that is possibly true for now, it'd be pretty easy to engage in tests to prove how it's reacting.

305
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,038
Scott: When we get to the point where someone can wear them and I could say, "Put them

306
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:04,279
Scott: down."

307
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,963
Scott: And they put them down.

308
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:05,668
Scott: And I can put them up.

309
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,191
Scott: And they put them up.

310
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:06,633
Scott: Then that is...

311
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,949
Rym: That's an entirely different kind of thing.

312
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:16,740
Rym: And two, there are games, a whole class of games, they don't work that well, but they work okay, where you can learn to do things like that.

313
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,300
Scott: Yeah, if you have like an fMRI and not a pair of cat ears.

314
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,319
Rym: Actually, no, you don't need an fMRI to do things like that.

315
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:28,320
Rym: Anyway, your ignorance aside, what do you have?

316
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,809
Scott: So, I didn't have a good thing of the day.

317
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:35,460
Scott: So I didn't want to use CollegeHumor as is our fallback.

318
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,259
Scott: So I went to fallback number two, cinematicmassacre.com.

319
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:40,420
Rym: Ah, shit.

320
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:44,639
Scott: I haven't talked about them in a while, but I just want to remind everyone, there's a guy named James Rolfe.

321
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,544
Scott: He is the awesome.

322
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:46,409
Scott: He is like us.

323
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,280
Scott: He is our kindred type person.

324
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,095
Scott: Even though we didn't meet him, even at MAGFest, we wanted to meet him.

325
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:51,859
Scott: And he was there.

326
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,740
Scott: And he is the Angry Video Game Nerd, if you did not know.

327
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,500
Scott: If you don't know the Angry Video Game Nerd, well, guess what?

328
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,644
Rym: You know what?

329
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:04,100
Rym: He's going to take you back to the past to play the shitty games that sucked ass.

330
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,807
Scott: That's right.

331
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:05,679
Scott: Well, they still suck ass.

332
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,080
Rym: That song will get stuck in your head and you'll catch yourself humming.

333
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:15,000
Rym: He'd rather let a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in his ear.

334
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,580
Scott: He's been coming out pretty, you know, he used to come out with videos pretty irregularly, right?

335
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,759
Scott: Except for the month of October, we had a video every day.

336
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:25,894
Scott: He's been coming out with videos much more regularly as of late.

337
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,260
Scott: At least one video every day.

338
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,920
Scott: He'll even put out like a crap video or something that he just threw together just to put something out almost every weekday.

339
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,160
Scott: And what he's been doing a lot lately is Ninja Turtles, animated Ninja Turtles.

340
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,060
Scott: I think it's because he's rewatching animated Ninja Turtles, all of it.

341
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,440
Scott: So it's on his brain, so he's making a lot of videos.

342
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,840
Rym: I have this weird feeling that that show will not be as good as I remember it being.

343
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,920
Scott: No, I don't think you should actually rewatch the show like he is.

344
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,560
Scott: I think you should just watch his reviews of the show, where he's cut out clips and put them in an entertaining context.

345
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:03,480
Scott: However, there's one particular Ninja Turtle video that is my thing of the day that he has put up, his most recent video as of this podcast.

346
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:06,779
Scott: And it is Michelangelo's Pizza Taste Test.

347
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:14,919
Scott: If you remember, during the Ninja Turtle show, Michelangelo would, you know, the animation at least, Michelangelo would- Was a party dude.

348
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,399
Scott: He was a party dude, and he would always order pizzas.

349
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,500
Scott: He was, he cared about, all the turtles loved pizza, but Michelangelo loved it ten times as much.

350
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,540
Rym: Kind of like how in the Mario cartoon, they all cared about lasagna and pasta.

351
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:26,122
Scott: Yep.

352
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:32,340
Scott: Well, Michelangelo, if you don't remember, he always got crazy fucked up pizzas.

353
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,420
Scott: Like pepperoni and marshmallow, or avocado, chili pepper- That sounds really good.

354
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:40,679
Scott: Clam sauce pizza.

355
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:41,979
Rym: That still sounds really good.

356
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:57,879
Scott: So, James Rolfe and a bunch of his friends had a party, where they ordered a whole bunch of plain cheese pizzas, and they made every single one of Michelangelo's crazy pizzas by applying the toppings to the plain cheese delivery pizza, and I guess heating it up a bit.

357
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,440
Scott: And then they took a pizza slicer and cut, you know, one slice of pizza into a bunch of little bits.

358
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,359
Scott: So they each had pretty much a few bites of each nasty pizza.

359
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:09,179
Scott: That way they had enough room in the stomach to try all of them.

360
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:18,560
Scott: And he shows you pretty much a clip of Michelangelo saying what the pizza is, and then them eating it, and judging the different flavors.

361
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,898
Scott: And it gets, uh, some of them are pretty nasty, some of them are not as nasty.

362
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:26,300
Scott: Apparently anything with hot fudge was the worst.

363
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,319
Rym: Yeah, that sounds about right.

364
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:29,952
Scott: Yeah.

365
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:30,700
Scott: This video's awesome.

366
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,019
Rym: So, I'm hungry now.

367
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,700
Rym: And it goes- I want that avocado chili pepper pizza.

368
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:42,059
Scott: It goes very much in line with our Hacking the Boardwalk episode of, you know- Oh my god, I got a link to that now.

369
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:42,425
Rym: Yeah.

370
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,209
Rym: So, get to the meta moment.

371
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:45,779
Rym: This is meta because it involves us.

372
00:17:46,280 --> 00:18:00,098
Rym: But many years ago, and the fact that it was many years ago makes me feel really old, we were in Wildwood, our kind of perennial summer writer's retreat hangout where we dick around and don't do anything except sleep on the beach and eat Russo's Subs, 99 cent pizza.

373
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:07,060
Rym: And one day, we just, you know, there's a place that has like deep fried Oreos, deep fried, you know, whatever.

374
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,260
Scott: They're retelling a story that was already in a podcast that people can just listen to.

375
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,279
Rym: Because that wasn't a podcast for many, many, many years ago?

376
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:13,398
Scott: It's still there.

377
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,265
Rym: Anyway, briefly.

378
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:18,500
Rym: So, the guy was like, you know, he has all this stuff and he'll fry whatever.

379
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,339
Rym: So, we go up to him, we're like, "If we bring you a slice of pepperoni pizza, will you deep fry

380
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:22,420
Rym: it?".

381
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:28,640
Rym: And we photoblogged us going through all of this and eventually eating the deep fried pepperoni pizza.

382
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:29,069
Scott: Yeah.

383
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,700
Rym: It was pretty epic and it tasted like a Hot Pocket.

384
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,517
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

385
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:39,600
Rym: But this weekend, on Friday, is the Nerd NYC board game night where you're always at, at Think Coffee downtown.

386
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:40,279
Rym: Yep.

387
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:46,177
Rym: If you wanna hang out with us and actually hang out, as many listeners have been doing recently, come down, play some games.

388
00:18:46,197 --> 00:18:46,639
Rym: We'll be there.

389
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:47,100
Rym: We're friendly.

390
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:47,720
Scott: Yep.

391
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:52,312
Scott: Already mentioned, BarCamp NYC is May 21st and 22nd.

392
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:55,320
Scott: You gotta go to the BarCamp NYC 6 website to register.

393
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,418
Scott: It's free and then you just gotta show up.

394
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,216
Rym: Tomorrow, Thursday, May 12th, from 7pm until whenever.

395
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:04,080
Rym: I don't know exactly when.

396
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,912
Scott: I thought that was Friday the 13th at 7pm.

397
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:07,296
Rym: No.

398
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:07,777
Scott: No?

399
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:08,879
Rym: No, it's May 12th.

400
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:09,840
Scott: Okay.

401
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,285
Rym: 7pm, no quarter exhibition of games.

402
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,473
Rym: This is in New York City on Broadway, 721 Broadway.

403
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:17,598
Rym: It is an exhibition of games.

404
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,558
Scott: Alright.

405
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:21,007
Rym: It looks really cool.

406
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,640
Rym: It's NYU's Game Center.

407
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:24,083
Scott: Nice.

408
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:28,860
Scott: Recess, Nerd NYC Recess is June 18th and that's all the events we'll talk about for now.

409
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:29,622
Rym: Yeah.

410
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:31,134
Rym: PAX, PAX Dev, all that.

411
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:31,860
Rym: We'll probably be at 'em.

412
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,979
Scott: That's a long time from now.

413
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,253
Scott: Yep.

414
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:39,800
Rym: And you can't come, but this weekend we're playing an epic game of diplomacy for the worldwide championship belt.

415
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:40,962
Scott: Yeah.

416
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,220
Rym: We'll have some pictures of the winner, maybe some video.

417
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,785
Scott: Maybe.

418
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:46,859
Scott: And you should join our forum.

419
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,913
Rym: Forum's rockin'.

420
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:56,120
Scott: If you, you know, a lot of people out there, you're lurkers or maybe you don't do internet forums or you think you don't do internet forums.

421
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,507
Rym: Don't do internet forums.

422
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:58,051
Rym: They all suck.

423
00:19:58,253 --> 00:19:59,120
Rym: Accept ours.

424
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:06,139
Scott: Change your ways and go to forum.frontrowcrew.com, sign up, make sure you just, you can type something in the box that says "Why are you

425
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:06,480
Scott: joining?".

426
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,249
Scott: Just type, it doesn't matter what you type, you just have to type something.

427
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:12,380
Scott: that makes me believe that you are not a robot, that you are an actual human being.

428
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,052
Scott: And then you will be approved and then you can talk to everybody.

429
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,160
Scott: and people are talking all the time about ponies.

430
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,080
Rym: The real reason our forum is better than all the others, and you should know this going in, we have very few rules.

431
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,100
Rym: You can do whatever you want as long as you do it with correct grammar and spelling.

432
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:27,710
Scott: Yep.

433
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:28,654
Scott: That's really it.

434
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,472
Scott: Yep.

435
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:36,120
Rym: So we did a slightly similar show a long time ago about how to get into all these things.

436
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,800
Scott: How to get into, you know, it was a how to get into, I think, a week, right?

437
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,876
Scott: It was how to get into, right?

438
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:46,260
Scott: And it was basically, if you haven't done XGeekery, here is how to start doing XGeekery.

439
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,760
Scott: And the thing is, the answer almost always is...

440
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,159
Rym: Start doing it.

441
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:50,986
Scott: Do whatever it is.

442
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:52,538
Scott: I want to get into playing flute.

443
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:53,283
Scott: Flute!

444
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:53,947
Scott: Well, you know what?

445
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:56,300
Scott: Go get yourself a flute and start playing it.

446
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,480
Scott: And go and get some flute instructional videos and search for how to play flute on Google and read the instructions and do it.

447
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,660
Scott: And replace flute with anything, you know?

448
00:21:05,022 --> 00:21:06,080
Scott: I want to do electronics.

449
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,260
Scott: Go buy an Arduino and just go to the websites, read what it says, and follow the instructions.

450
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,559
Scott: That's how you do things.

451
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:20,800
Scott: But we don't actually do a whole lot of, you know, personal reflection kind of podcasts on GeekNights.

452
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:21,824
Rym: Even though people want it.

453
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:25,420
Rym: And I think what happened was we used to a lot more in the old days.

454
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:27,660
Rym: Because we had a gigantic store...

455
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,280
Scott: Oh yeah, we had Geek Fables were very...

456
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,960
Rym: We had a store of anecdotes reaching back decades.

457
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:36,500
Scott: And we... We used most of the notable and memorable ones.

458
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,140
Rym: In well over 700 episodes of GeekNights, we have talked about the bamboo.

459
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,990
Rym: We've talked about the vision.

460
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:44,139
Rym: We've talked about...

461
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,560
Scott: The vision and the bamboo go together.

462
00:21:45,702 --> 00:21:47,100
Rym: Oh my god, the vision happened.

463
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,300
Rym: Well, the vision precursor was before the bamboo.

464
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,940
Rym: But the vision culminated...

465
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,519
Scott: Without the vision, there would have been no bamboo.

466
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,100
Rym: That bamboo was one of the darker visions.

467
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,080
Rym: That was perhaps the worst thing that has ever happened.

468
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,994
Rym: What do you see?

469
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:00,238
Rym: Bamboo!

470
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:03,580
Rym: What do you smell?

471
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,023
Scott: No.

472
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:06,260
Scott: Anyway.

473
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,980
Scott: You know, but the other thing is, you know, I've said this before.

474
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:17,800
Scott: But I want to try to make it so that, you know, if there's a GeekNights episode, that anyone who... Even if it's your... Any episode should be able to be someone's first episode.

475
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,459
Scott: So we shouldn't talk about anything that's like community based or so personal that it excludes...

476
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,676
Rym: Like, "Oh, Amnushu was doing something on the

477
00:22:25,716 --> 00:22:26,059
Rym: farm.".

478
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:26,500
Rym: Right.

479
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,920
Scott: So anyone who isn't already a GeekNights listener doesn't give two shits about that.

480
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,258
Scott: But this, you know, if we talk about our own personal stories, how did you start... How did you discover X?

481
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,139
Rym: No, Scott, I'm worried here.

482
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:43,680
Rym: We're starting this show by rationalizing why we're doing this show.

483
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,444
Rym: We're like, "Don't worry.

484
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:45,008
Rym: Don't worry.

485
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,075
Rym: Here's why we're doing it.

486
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:46,257
Scott: It's

487
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:46,559
Scott: okay.".

488
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,879
Scott: Well, because if any time you do something contrary to your philosophy on the internet, you risk being called out.

489
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:53,600
Rym: How is this in any way contrary?

490
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,720
Rym: No, in fact, people like the anecdotes.

491
00:22:57,321 --> 00:23:02,380
Rym: The only time people get mad and call us out is when you talk about politics.

492
00:23:03,543 --> 00:23:04,859
Scott: Which I don't want to talk about.

493
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:05,768
Rym: I always do.

494
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:06,839
Rym: I can hit Scogeal on here.

495
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:07,819
Scott: Anyway.

496
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:10,520
Rym: So, let's start with comics.

497
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,940
Rym: Regular superhero comics.

498
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:14,269
Scott: Well, it doesn't have to be superhero.

499
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:15,660
Scott: I mean, comics are comics, right?

500
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,060
Rym: Ah, but I got into... Well, I had three levels of comics.

501
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,800
Rym: The first comics I got into were actually just, you know, Foxtrot kind of comics.

502
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,380
Rym: Bloom County.

503
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:23,840
Scott: I think everyone was that way.

504
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,020
Scott: Reading comics in the newspaper before reading any other sorts of comics.

505
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:41,560
Rym: If I think way back, the first newspaper comics that I was aware of... Like, I, as a sentient human, recognized that what I was reading was a comic in a newspaper, and that I was enjoying, was Calvin and Hobbes, probably.

506
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,200
Rym: Yeah, probably.

507
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,520
Rym: Maybe a lot of that crap like High and Lowest and Cathy, because it was just there, and I'd read it.

508
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,377
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, like, in those early days, reading comics in the newspaper, it was like a lot...

509
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,378
Rym: I'd just read them all.

510
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:55,640
Scott: I hated... I just, like, ignored the vast majority of them.

511
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:56,794
Rym: I hated them all.

512
00:23:57,016 --> 00:23:57,320
Rym: Almost.

513
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,794
Rym: But I read them all anyway.

514
00:23:58,835 --> 00:23:59,299
Rym: You know why?

515
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,420
Rym: Because I was sitting at the table, eating a bowl of cereal.

516
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,045
Rym: And you know what?

517
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:04,055
Rym: When you're eight...

518
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:05,440
Scott: What are you gonna read?

519
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:09,480
Rym: When you're eight, eating a bowl of cereal might as well take four years.

520
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,207
Scott: You're gonna read it?

521
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:11,280
Scott: Is he gonna read the cereal box?

522
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,286
Rym: That is infinite time.

523
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:13,440
Rym: You've already read the cereal box.

524
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,579
Scott: And you've already done the mini page.

525
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,331
Rym: There's this great cyanide and happiness recently.

526
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:19,260
Rym: A guy goes into the shitter to take a shit, right?

527
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,766
Rym: He sits down and he's like, "Oh, no.

528
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:22,173
Rym: I forgot my smartphone.

529
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:23,017
Rym: What'll I

530
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:23,238
Rym: do?".

531
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,730
Rym: And then it has this series of frames of, like, zooming in on his eye, and then his eye becomes stars, and endless cosmos has come and go.

532
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:32,460
Rym: The infinite passing of epochs.

533
00:24:35,222 --> 00:24:37,015
Rym: Yeah, but you think we're impatient now?

534
00:24:37,115 --> 00:24:37,699
Rym: When I was eight?

535
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,940
Rym: So I'd read the entirety of the funnies, and I don't know why.

536
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,000
Scott: I skipped over the Rex Morgan MDs and the funky winker beans.

537
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,100
Rym: The thing is, Rex Morgan, there were two words in the whole comic.

538
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,793
Scott: Or apartment 3Gs.

539
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,285
Rym: So you say you don't read.

540
00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:52,667
Rym: You know what?

541
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:54,639
Rym: I read them because there was nothing in them.

542
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:56,427
Rym: I did not process.

543
00:24:56,688 --> 00:24:58,599
Rym: I saw, but did not see.

544
00:24:59,443 --> 00:25:03,240
Scott: What always did bother me, though, was some newspapers that have some comics and others wouldn't.

545
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,860
Rym: Oh, that was the worst, because we got the Detroit News.

546
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,200
Scott: Sometimes you'd get a comic on Sunday, but you wouldn't get it during the week.

547
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,000
Rym: Ah, we got the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press, so we got all the good comics.

548
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:17,000
Rym: But if I went to anyone else's house and they got some shit newspaper, I'd stay over at a friend's house and they'd have USA Today.

549
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:19,425
Scott: It was weird, though, right?

550
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:27,920
Scott: Because even though I read comics in the newspaper, I had absolutely no interest in actual comic books.

551
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:35,000
Scott: I knew they existed, and I knew who these characters were because I watched 60s Batman reruns on TV.

552
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:37,009
Scott: So I knew when I saw Batman '89.

553
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,160
Scott: I knew who all these superheroes were.

554
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,664
Scott: Superman.

555
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:41,379
Scott: Of course I knew who Superman and Spider-Man were.

556
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,708
Scott: But I had absolutely no interest in reading comics.

557
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:44,813
Scott: I looked down on comics.

558
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:46,440
Scott: I didn't want to read comic books.

559
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,398
Rym: Well, see, I had this weird thing.

560
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:48,809
Scott: I don't know why.

561
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:49,540
Scott: I just didn't want to read them.

562
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:58,260
Rym: The moment where I went from reading the newspaper comics because, literally, I had infinite amounts of time and I had to do something or I would have gone crazy.

563
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:05,680
Rym: I was when my parents would buy the Bloom County compilation, the big book of Calvin and Hobbes.

564
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,980
Scott: Yeah, we never bought any of those.

565
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,065
Rym: We bought all of those.

566
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:16,980
Rym: So basically, as soon as those appeared in my life, I read them and comics went from this kind of nothing activity to something I actively seeked out.

567
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:20,240
Rym: And as a result, I only sought these specific comics that were good.

568
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:25,120
Rym: From then on, I really only read Calvin and Hobbes, Foxtrot, Overboard.

569
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,600
Rym: For some reason, I have this weird fondness for Overboard.

570
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,600
Scott: I don't even know what Overboard is.

571
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:28,845
Scott: Really?

572
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:29,480
Scott: It was about pirates.

573
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:32,360
Scott: We don't have that one, but now I wish we had that one because it's about pirates.

574
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,283
Rym: It's about pirates.

575
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:36,600
Rym: Imagine if Dilbert were about pirates.

576
00:26:37,482 --> 00:26:39,019
Rym: That's really the best way I can describe it.

577
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,420
Scott: I even had one of my friends gave me an X-Men coloring book that was early '80s X-Men.

578
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,751
Scott: I was like, "Who the hell are the

579
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:47,872
Scott: X-Men?".

580
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:54,500
Rym: I also had, maybe it was just my family, we had every Mad Magazine going back to almost the beginning.

581
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,246
Scott: My mom still has them.

582
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:56,336
Rym: Every goddamn Mad Magazine.

583
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,360
Scott: Did not have any Mad Magazines.

584
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,460
Scott: But I knew that it existed and I had no interest.

585
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,920
Rym: In fact, a lot of them are pretty valuable today because they're all in me condition.

586
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,780
Rym: So as a kid, shortly after that, after reading all these other comics, I found this Mad collection.

587
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,718
Rym: I read every one of them.

588
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,160
Rym: We also had these old, they smelled like old people books of peanuts.

589
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,440
Rym: I've read almost every Peanuts comic ever.

590
00:27:18,662 --> 00:27:20,640
Scott: I read those in my elementary school library.

591
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,457
Scott: They're like little paperback ones.

592
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
Rym: Yeah, the little paperback ones that smelled bad and fell apart.

593
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,652
Scott: Yep, exactly.

594
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:26,140
Scott: Same ones.

595
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,840
Rym: So that is how I got into comics.

596
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,560
Rym: In fact, my mom had all these old Fantastic Fours that I didn't like, but they were there.

597
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:38,460
Rym: I really only liked Peanuts and Overboard and Bloom County and all that.

598
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:40,560
Rym: That's actually kind of an aside.

599
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,840
Rym: That's how I got into politics.

600
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,499
Rym: Because as a kid, you don't really know.

601
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:48,779
Rym: When I was young, I didn't know right wing, left wing, Republican, anything at all.

602
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:49,759
Scott: I didn't either.

603
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,260
Rym: I knew the Soviets want Anukas and the basic things that kids know.

604
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,839
Scott: I didn't even know that until at that time.

605
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,040
Rym: And I was really interested in the Gulf War because I was convinced that I knew how to fix it.

606
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,380
Rym: And that it was my duty to tell President Bush.

607
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,860
Rym: And I got kind of frustrated and disturbed as a kid.

608
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,400
Rym: I was worried that if I didn't tell an adult, that the war would keep going.

609
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,179
Rym: And I started to feel responsible for the war.

610
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:11,791
Scott: Okay.

611
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,119
Rym: I was a weird kid.

612
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:20,560
Rym: But I got into politics because I read Bloom County so much that I knew all the proper nouns of 80s politics in the US.

613
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,240
Scott: See, because I read a lot of those comics and I didn't even understand that they were political.

614
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,159
Scott: Because a lot of them all basically have other jokes at the same time.

615
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,100
Rym: Yeah, I guess I got interested in both.

616
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,160
Rym: Or at least I'd recognize names of people.

617
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,320
Scott: This is elementary school we're talking about.

618
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:38,760
Rym: So that's how I got into politics.

619
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,740
Rym: But that's also how I got into comics, reading these big compilation books.

620
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:44,300
Scott: See, what happened to me, right?

621
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,080
Rym: Didn't read superheroes because I thought they were stupid.

622
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,900
Rym: Even as a little kid, I thought Superman was stupid.

623
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:48,897
Scott: Yeah, I did too.

624
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,575
Scott: But it's like, I didn't actively think he was stupid.

625
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:54,960
Scott: I just kind of didn't care at all.

626
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:57,420
Rym: I thought superheroes were stupid as a kid.

627
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,960
Rym: I just thought they were a dumb thing and I wasn't interested in them.

628
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,092
Scott: I mean, I liked 60s Batman when I was in elementary school.

629
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,000
Rym: With Adam West, I watched that movie endlessly.

630
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:08,440
Scott: I never actually saw that until much later.

631
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,039
Scott: But the '89 Batman I liked.

632
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,419
Rym: We had a VHS tape of it that I'd watch every now and then.

633
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:14,532
Scott: But it wasn't until like in the early 90s, like '91, right?

634
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,120
Scott: I guess it was '09 or '10, '08, '09, '10, something like that, right?

635
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,460
Scott: My friend down the street who I'd go over to his house, he suddenly was reading comic books.

636
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,177
Scott: And I was like, what?

637
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:27,559
Scott: Because no one I knew had ever read comic books.

638
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:28,680
Scott: And I didn't care.

639
00:29:29,121 --> 00:29:34,200
Rym: There were like one or two nerdy kids in my school who, you know, I was nerdy but in different ways, who read comics.

640
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,639
Rym: And everyone else, just no one cared about comics.

641
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,554
Scott: It's like I saw Dennis the Menace reading comics in cartoons.

642
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:41,340
Scott: Or I saw Calvin reading comics.

643
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,419
Rym: I had this weird impression of superhero comics.

644
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,360
Rym: Maybe it's just because the only comics in my house were really, really old comics.

645
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,520
Rym: And I'd only ever see comics in old comics, referring to people reading comics.

646
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,660
Rym: Comics were a thing that kids in the 20s read that nobody cares about today.

647
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,420
Rym: I thought they were like this archaic, lost art form.

648
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,739
Scott: Yeah, I'd never actually seen people with comic books.

649
00:30:03,023 --> 00:30:06,440
Scott: Even though I sort of knew they existed, I didn't want or care to read them.

650
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,280
Scott: But then a kid down the street got them and he was reading like Iron Man and Moon Knight.

651
00:30:12,005 --> 00:30:12,620
Rym: Moon Knight?

652
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:13,519
Scott: You know Moon Knight?

653
00:30:13,662 --> 00:30:14,420
Rym: I know about Moon Knight.

654
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,560
Scott: And like Infinity Gauntlet and Morbius and all this stuff.

655
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,660
Scott: And I was like, okay, whatever.

656
00:30:20,263 --> 00:30:22,138
Scott: And I didn't really read them, but you know what I did do?

657
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:25,072
Scott: I started collecting, obviously this was the early 90s.

658
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,139
Rym: The cards?

659
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:27,775
Scott: Yeah.

660
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,340
Rym: I collected the cards before I learned who the X-Men were from collecting the X-Men cards because those cards had stats on the back.

661
00:30:35,482 --> 00:30:36,257
Rym: Yup, yup.

662
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:40,320
Rym: And for some reason I was like, whoa, Wolverine has the strength of that?

663
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:41,840
Rym: But this Jean Grey character?

664
00:30:42,451 --> 00:30:42,758
Rym: Yup, yup.

665
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,720
Rym: And I got really interested based on that and that alone.

666
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,420
Scott: So in the early 90s, right, there was sort of this explosion.

667
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,380
Scott: Like friend down the street is reading comics.

668
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,960
Scott: I didn't really read any of his comics, but I saw that he was reading them.

669
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,880
Scott: And then comic book shock opens in the mall, right near my house.

670
00:30:57,541 --> 00:31:01,413
Scott: And then I went to the comic shop in the mall and I was collecting baseball cards.

671
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:03,460
Scott: at the time, you know, because I had been doing that.

672
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,499
Rym: I never collected those.

673
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:08,859
Scott: Well, my dad basically would like buy a pack every week and so it just built up.

674
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:11,760
Scott: I also would do like those sticker books.

675
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,260
Scott: Like I have an Alf sticker book that has 3D glasses.

676
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,140
Rym: I had a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles one.

677
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:16,798
Scott: I had that one.

678
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,188
Rym: Yeah.

679
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,680
Scott: And those were basically cards, but every, you know, the cards had two stickers.

680
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,860
Rym: I collected a lot of weird things along those lines.

681
00:31:23,221 --> 00:31:26,040
Rym: Like Beavis and Butthead, there was a trading card series that I just had.

682
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,280
Scott: I had an Alf trading card series.

683
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:30,279
Rym: I had all the Nintendo ones.

684
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,518
Scott: I didn't have Nintendo ones.

685
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,660
Rym: But it's weird that we collected those cards for the comic books, but didn't read the comic books.

686
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,298
Scott: Well, I did.

687
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:39,720
Scott: See, it was basically shortly after, right?

688
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,639
Scott: So it's like the X-Men cartoon came onto TV.

689
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,240
Scott: You know, my friend down the street was reading comics.

690
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,491
Rym: X-Men cartoon is.

691
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:47,119
Rym: what did it for me.

692
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,320
Scott: I was going to the comic book store to buy these cards, right?

693
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,320
Scott: And then, you know, I bought, I started buying comics.

694
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,720
Scott: And basically the thing was I didn't have a lot of money as a punk kid, right?

695
00:31:57,841 --> 00:32:00,620
Scott: And I spent most of the money on the cards, which are actually really expensive.

696
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:06,060
Scott: So the only two comics I read as a kid were Spider-Man 2099 and Adjectiveless X-Men.

697
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,900
Scott: And barely anything else at all.

698
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,980
Rym: Ah, for me it was the Uncanny X-Men and X-Men, and X-Factor and X-Force.

699
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:18,020
Rym: Because basically I knew, by then I knew about the X-Men and I was collecting the cards, but I didn't read the comics at all.

700
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,440
Rym: And independently, you know, when the cartoon came out, I got really into the cartoon, but not anything else.

701
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,320
Rym: Like just the cartoon was all I liked.

702
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,499
Rym: I didn't care about the comics related to it.

703
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:34,000
Rym: But, around all those times, comic books got suddenly popular.

704
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,380
Rym: Like suddenly I started seeing everyone around reading them.

705
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:41,560
Scott: Well, it was because people, you know, there was a huge speculation boom going on.

706
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,698
Scott: Which was pretty much the story of comics in the 90s.

707
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,938
Rym: So I was into board games.

708
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,060
Scott: Of course, being young impressionable 10 year olds, we got caught up in that real easily.

709
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,629
Rym: But I was into board games, right?

710
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,320
Rym: So I got this X-Men board game.

711
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:54,060
Rym: And it was pretty shit.

712
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:57,320
Rym: But it came with all these figures that I painted poorly.

713
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:01,400
Rym: And it came with one copy of X-Men.

714
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,840
Rym: And it was right after the end of the Executioner's Song was where that comic was.

715
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:06,280
Rym: Yup.

716
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,404
Scott: You know what?

717
00:33:07,504 --> 00:33:10,358
Scott: Executioner's Song trade paperback is coming out real soon.

718
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:10,820
Scott: I'm ordering it.

719
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,980
Rym: Oh shit, I should read that.

720
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,580
Rym: That's the only, that is the only story in all of X-Men I've read all the way through.

721
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:18,760
Scott: Ever.

722
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:23,960
Rym: So basically, this comic that came with the game was like the denouement to that.

723
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,539
Rym: It was like Beast and Cyclops just talking about all the shit that went down.

724
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,773
Rym: And I was like, this isn't what I expected.

725
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:31,719
Rym: It's mostly words.

726
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:39,120
Scott: Well, that was, you know, it was probably Claremont who was the wordiest, you know, Claremont and Burn are the wordiest motherfuckers in the universe.

727
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,650
Rym: And as a result, I got this mistaken impression.

728
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,060
Rym: I was like, oh, comics are actually kind of erudite.

729
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,029
Rym: Look at all that metaphor.

730
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:45,554
Rym: Mmm.

731
00:33:46,664 --> 00:33:47,318
Scott: They were trying to be.

732
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:48,560
Rym: Yeah, I didn't know better.

733
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,740
Rym: So then I went and I bought the comic that came before that one.

734
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,140
Rym: And then I realized there was this story and I had to buy a bunch of X-Factors and X-Forces and all this bullshit.

735
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,830
Rym: And I got it all.

736
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:01,020
Rym: And I read it all.

737
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:06,320
Rym: And I kept reading X-Men from that point until about Phalanx, all that stuff.

738
00:34:07,022 --> 00:34:08,049
Rym: And then I just stopped.

739
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:09,520
Rym: I couldn't tell you why.

740
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:10,266
Scott: I stopped.

741
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:11,560
Scott: I can tell you exactly why I stopped.

742
00:34:11,621 --> 00:34:13,320
Scott: Because the comic book store in the mall went out of business.

743
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:16,580
Scott: So I couldn't get, I couldn't get the next comic.

744
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,634
Scott: So then basically I just, you know, it's weird.

745
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:20,840
Scott: It's like the comic store disappeared.

746
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:30,880
Scott: And I was just like, uh, I mean, X, something happened in X-Men, uh, like around issue 30, 31, where it's like one issue, like skipped a bunch of plot.

747
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,831
Scott: And I was like, what the fuck?

748
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:32,620
Scott: or whatever.

749
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:36,759
Scott: And I really only cared about Spider-Man 2099 because X-Men dicked me over like that.

750
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,639
Scott: But then the comic store closed and I couldn't get the next issue.

751
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:48,043
Scott: And I tried like a little bit and then I gave up until the year like 2001.

752
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:48,284
Scott: Right.

753
00:34:48,364 --> 00:34:51,280
Scott: In the year 2001, I can tell you exactly what happened because it's much more recent.

754
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,880
Scott: Uh, I was already back into the animes, right?

755
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:00,060
Scott: We were at RIT and, uh, we went to Borders a lot to look at the mangas there.

756
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,580
Scott: And because of the anime, we were looking at mangas.

757
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:12,840
Scott: And what I saw on the comic shelf, they had, you know, over by the magazine racks, not by the manga shelf, but by the magazine racks, it was Ghost in the Shell 2 number one.

758
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:18,660
Scott: So I picked that up and I was actually going to Borders to buy that comic book and that comic book only.

759
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:24,680
Scott: And then, uh, in our second year at RIT, my friend Ian shows up, right?

760
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:26,500
Scott: Uh, cause he went to RIT also.

761
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,500
Rym: Oh right, that's when you guys would go to the secret mall.

762
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,611
Rym: And he said, hey, you want to go to the comic shop?

763
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,940
Scott: And I'm like, yeah, I'd need the next issue of Ghost in the Shell.

764
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,600
Scott: If they have it there, then, you know, I won't have to go to Borders and maybe it'll be better there.

765
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,280
Rym: That was when I learned of the comic shop culture because that was the shop where, like, Luke and everybody had their account.

766
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,379
Scott: Well, no, they went to a different shop than us.

767
00:35:46,982 --> 00:35:50,460
Scott: They went to, uh, they went to Comic Book Heaven, which is run by an old guy.

768
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,740
Rym: Yeah, because there was drama between that guy and the anime club I had to deal with.

769
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,526
Scott: Yeah, no, that was a different one.

770
00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:59,076
Scott: That was, uh, Empire Comics.

771
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,120
Scott: That was the third shop.

772
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,419
Rym: I didn't know there was a third shop.

773
00:36:02,123 --> 00:36:04,940
Rym: The only one I actually ever went to to buy comics was the one in Hippie Mall.

774
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,803
Scott: Comics was the drama.

775
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,369
Scott: Comic Book Heaven was the old guy.

776
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,500
Scott: The one that I went to in the Hippie Mall was comic books, et cetera.

777
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,340
Scott: Rochester had a lot of nerdy stuff because it was in Millennium Games.

778
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:14,860
Rym: That Hippie Mall was pretty great.

779
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,004
Scott: The Hippie Mall was pretty great.

780
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:17,710
Scott: Comic, et cetera, was a pretty great shop.

781
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,560
Scott: I liked the way they were organized by sort of feel, you know.

782
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:32,359
Scott: And the thing is that when I went to comics, et cetera, right, I tried, I basically wanted to ignore the Marvel and the DC stuff because I didn't, you know, I was money conscious and I didn't want to get caught up in, you know, these crossovers and all that bullshit that I knew was going on.

783
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:40,840
Scott: So I was, I would only buy like mini series if it was a Marvel or DC thing, you know, like I bought, uh, and I basically just looked at the shelf and picked stuff out.

784
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,780
Scott: Like I read this, uh, it was a series mostly for kids, Sentinel.

785
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,852
Scott: It was a self-contained series about a Sentinel.

786
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,700
Scott: This kid finds a Sentinel in his backyard.

787
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:49,551
Scott: It's, I still have it.

788
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:50,199
Scott: It's pretty awesome.

789
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:51,096
Scott: I liked it.

790
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,451
Scott: There was a Voltron comic.

791
00:36:52,492 --> 00:36:53,179
Scott: That was pretty good.

792
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:56,660
Scott: Uh, and I was also starting to, you know, see what mangas were coming out.

793
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,234
Scott: Like, you know, I bought all of Akira for the first time.

794
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:00,460
Scott: I just finished buying it for the second time.

795
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,442
Rym: I have a much, it's weird.

796
00:37:01,462 --> 00:37:09,940
Rym: I have such an like older and spotty history of manga because anime I get into, you know, when I was eight, fourth grade, my mom made me watch vampire hunter D against my will.

797
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:14,340
Rym: But around, I watched all the anime I could get forever.

798
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,908
Rym: And then it wasn't until high school.

799
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:20,880
Rym: Cause I knew vaguely around like my freshman year of high school that manga existed.

800
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:21,922
Rym: I heard of it.

801
00:37:21,942 --> 00:37:29,280
Rym: I was like, I heard that anime was all based on Japanese comics and I got really interested in that and you couldn't get it.

802
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,340
Rym: It just wasn't anywhere.

803
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:38,354
Scott: Well, actually the thing was is in the comic shop that I went to as a kid that didn't close yet, there was one small area that I always completely ignored.

804
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:41,340
Scott: that had a whole bunch of Ranma half tapes.

805
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:51,000
Scott: And probably, you know, they probably had all those like Viz manga that were in individual issues, you know, uh, and they probably had, you know, the, the, all that stuff.

806
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,600
Rym: Ah, see the comic shops near me didn't have anything like that.

807
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,919
Scott: And I just completely ignored it and didn't give a shit.

808
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:57,459
Rym: The first manga I ever saw.

809
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,446
Scott: Just like I ignored all those image comics.

810
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:03,980
Scott: I basically, I was, I was really, I guess it was cause I didn't have enough money to buy all the comics.

811
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:13,340
Scott: That there was just something in me that's like I, when I was a kid, I like completely ignored and like I was really judging before trying almost everything.

812
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,960
Scott: Well, for me, the first.

813
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,120
Scott: And if I hadn't done that, I probably would have ended up buying.

814
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:17,939
Rym: I wanted manga.

815
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,000
Scott: A bunch of cool stuff.

816
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,243
Rym: And I would have bought it all.

817
00:38:20,304 --> 00:38:21,367
Rym: It just wasn't available.

818
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:24,917
Rym: And then one day I was in Florida with a marching band trip.

819
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:25,760
Rym: I think it was 10th grade.

820
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:26,520
Scott: And you found a manga.

821
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:31,000
Rym: And we, the last day, like we're going to fly out like late in the afternoon.

822
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:34,860
Rym: So we were all supposed to go into like Disney world or something or just like stay in the hotel.

823
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:38,680
Rym: We totally just ran off and went like downtown and went all over the place.

824
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:43,720
Rym: And eventually we ended up in the Virgin Megastore and they had a gigantic manga section.

825
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:43,981
Scott: Yeah.

826
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:45,329
Scott: Virgin Megastore was always weird.

827
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:47,080
Scott: We went to the one in New York before it closed.

828
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:48,857
Scott: Uh, at least the time square one.

829
00:38:48,877 --> 00:38:49,100
Scott: Remember?

830
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:50,632
Rym: And I remember I'm looking at her.

831
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:51,360
Rym: Yeah, I do remember that.

832
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:57,860
Scott: And the thing was is they had, you know, it's, they only sell, it's basically a giant FYE, but they have absolutely everything.

833
00:38:57,981 --> 00:38:59,620
Scott: So they even have the manga.

834
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,600
Rym: So I see the manga and I'm like, holy shit.

835
00:39:01,941 --> 00:39:05,100
Rym: And my couple of friends who were in anime are like, holy shit, manga.

836
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:08,980
Rym: And we're looking at it and looking at it and I didn't have much money left and they didn't have much money left.

837
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:12,234
Rym: And I saw in the middle of all of it, a Tenchi manga.

838
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:13,480
Rym: And I was really into Tenchi Muya.

839
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:13,895
Scott: Oh, good guy.

840
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,411
Rym: So I was like, fuck yeah.

841
00:39:15,451 --> 00:39:16,178
Rym: And I bought it.

842
00:39:16,548 --> 00:39:16,760
Scott: Nice.

843
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,659
Rym: It was the first manga I ever bought.

844
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:23,320
Rym: And then I just kept reading manga from that point onward.

845
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,140
Scott: Yeah.

846
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:33,940
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, anime is a sort of different, you know, I mean, I got into manga because I was in the anime club at RIT and we went to Borders and I saw manga there and I was already, I was already in the anime.

847
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,599
Scott: So there you go.

848
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,899
Scott: It was already super into anime.

849
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,760
Scott: It went right across the table.

850
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:43,520
Rym: Like anime club at RIT, my thought was, all right, I'll meet more than a handful of people who are super into anime.

851
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,840
Rym: Little did I know, I thought I was hardcore until I got to RIT anime.

852
00:39:47,726 --> 00:39:49,438
Scott: We weren't even hardcore when we left RIT yet.

853
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:50,012
Rym: I know.

854
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:57,680
Scott: But yeah, it's like I got into anime sort of like gradually, like it wasn't something that it was the forefront of my mind.

855
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:09,060
Scott: It was sort of just like, you know, I mean, obviously I watched the Transformers and the Voltron as a kid, which, you know, and all those sorts of things and Thundercats and, you know, things that were sort of anime sort of weren't, you know, depending on what it was.

856
00:40:09,862 --> 00:40:12,480
Scott: And then I knew animes existed and I kind of wanted to watch them.

857
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,660
Scott: Like, you know, in the late 80s, like Akira was in the newspaper and I knew that it existed.

858
00:40:16,963 --> 00:40:18,439
Scott: And I was like, oh, I kind of want to watch that.

859
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:28,840
Scott: But it wasn't actually until like Toonami when I would, you know, actually, you know, like, I mean, the local station, like syndicate Sailor Moon, but I didn't watch Sailor Moon.

860
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:31,099
Scott: I was like, fuck Sailor Moon.

861
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:35,080
Rym: By the time of Toonami, I already had a sizable VHS anime collection.

862
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,700
Rym: I had already bought hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of fansubs.

863
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,378
Scott: Yeah, not at all.

864
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:54,120
Rym: So when, you know, Toonami rolled around, I started watching, you know, and also when Sci-Fi Channel, you know, did their thing, you know, like I spent like 400 bucks to get all of Sailor Moon because I had to get SVHS tapes and mail them to a dude.

865
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,899
Scott: Yeah, I didn't know about fansubs existing until I got to RIT.

866
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,520
Rym: And that's in fact, that's where I got End of Eva.

867
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:07,680
Rym: I didn't know what Evangelion was, but I got End of Eva and I was like, hey, I got this anime movie and all my friends, we sat down and watched it.

868
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:11,080
Rym: And at the end they were like, Rym, what the fuck?

869
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:13,073
Rym: Yeah.

870
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:13,570
Rym: Yeah.

871
00:41:13,742 --> 00:41:14,380
Rym: That was great.

872
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,360
Rym: Especially when later I finally like learned what Eva was and I started watching it.

873
00:41:19,882 --> 00:41:22,380
Rym: And then I thought after a few episodes, like, wait a minute.

874
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:24,438
Rym: I know how this ends.

875
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:27,299
Rym: Oh, oh.

876
00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:33,720
Rym: But it's like in high school and even pretty much from fourth grade on, I was super into anime.

877
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,680
Rym: Anime was my second geekery.

878
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,340
Rym: The only thing more important than anime was gaming.

879
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,000
Rym: So I watched all the anime I could get.

880
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,880
Rym: I rented every goddamn anime from Blockbuster.

881
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,240
Rym: I just constantly, me and my little brother got into it.

882
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,259
Rym: I got my parents into it.

883
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:49,400
Rym: I'd watch Vampire Hunter D when I was a little kid over and over and over again.

884
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,038
Rym: I'd wanted to dress up as him for Halloween.

885
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:51,800
Scott: Yes.

886
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:57,940
Scott: You know, I slowly towards late, you know, once Toonami came out, there was slowly more animes, right?

887
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,320
Scott: I would watch more on sci-fi channel.

888
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:03,080
Scott: There was a week of Godzilla followed by a week of anime.

889
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,260
Scott: I was watching the week of Godzilla movies and the next week just happened to be week of anime movies.

890
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,020
Scott: And I watched like Galaxy Express and Fatal Fury.

891
00:42:12,724 --> 00:42:13,719
Scott: Fatal Fury is not so good.

892
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:14,839
Scott: It's awful.

893
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,699
Scott: You know, and then I was sort of like, all right.

894
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:25,280
Scott: I was sort of like, like anime was the thing I wanted, but I didn't know or care enough like to try a whole bunch to get more.

895
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,200
Scott: But like I saw RIT Anime Club and I was like, oh, that's where I can get more animes.

896
00:42:29,462 --> 00:42:29,777
Scott: All right.

897
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:34,272
Rym: And we were already all through high school, our D&D group would meet every Sunday and play for like 12 hours.

898
00:42:35,062 --> 00:42:37,097
Rym: Like all day, every Sunday we'd just play D&D.

899
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:37,656
Scott: Yeah.

900
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,639
Scott: There weren't enough nerds to play D&D by me.

901
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,760
Scott: So I had to be like, you know, when I got to RIT, I was like, all right, now I can play some fucking D&D.

902
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,999
Scott: Which is the only reason we're here today.

903
00:42:46,261 --> 00:42:47,145
Rym: At like 10 a.m.

904
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:51,040
Rym: we'd all meet and go to the grocery store and buy like a hundred dollars worth of shit.

905
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,060
Rym: And then we'd all converge in the basement of whoever's house.

906
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,434
Rym: We like rotated around and we'd dick around and I want to do them for like a couple of hours.

907
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:02,180
Rym: Then we'd play D&D forever, get food.

908
00:43:02,842 --> 00:43:05,960
Rym: And then we'd watch whatever anime we were watching.

909
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:08,320
Rym: And we just would get a VHS tape of every show.

910
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:10,839
Rym: And we'd always say, we'll watch one episode.

911
00:43:11,183 --> 00:43:12,340
Scott: And we watched all the episodes.

912
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,960
Rym: We'd watch every episode on the VHS tape.

913
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,118
Scott: I think the only anime I watched on a VHS before RIT was a dubbed Akira.

914
00:43:20,138 --> 00:43:20,800
Scott: Someone Let Me.

915
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,899
Rym: I watched at least 50 anime completely on VHS before I got to RIT.

916
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:27,820
Rym: Probably.

917
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,980
Rym: If you count all the movies and all the OAVs individually.

918
00:43:32,107 --> 00:43:32,800
Rym: Yeah, probably.

919
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:34,638
Rym: A lot of it was shit.

920
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,820
Rym: Like some of it was great though.

921
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,820
Rym: Like Project Aco has such a, like, it's dear to me watching that stuff.

922
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,299
Scott: I wonder if you hadn't seen Project Aco then and you only saw it now.

923
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:53,717
Rym: I've met people who've watched it recently because we told them to in those Anime You Should See panels and they loved it.

924
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,260
Rym: And I watched the first one again recently.

925
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:57,980
Rym: It's goddamn hilarious.

926
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:58,998
Rym: It really is.

927
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,639
Rym: It holds up funnily the same way that like Mahou Tsekai Tae holds up.

928
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:04,700
Rym: Like that level of comedy.

929
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,156
Rym: That's fun.

930
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,357
Rym: Of course I didn't know back then until recently when Gerald taught us the origin of Project Aco.

931
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:11,918
Scott: Yeah.

932
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:14,218
Rym: But I even had lulls.

933
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,075
Rym: Like I got into anime and then I'd seen everything I could get my hands on.

934
00:44:17,115 --> 00:44:22,760
Rym: so I had this lull where I didn't watch a lot of anime until I learned I could get fansubs.

935
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,880
Scott: I didn't learn about fansubs until RIT and by then it was just Anime Club Library and then digital fansubs came.

936
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:30,547
Scott: So it was digital fansubs.

937
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:34,513
Scott: and then there was like Episode of Gatekeeper and it was like, "Oh, digital

938
00:44:34,573 --> 00:44:35,239
Scott: fansubs!".

939
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,980
Scott: And then we're still at that point.

940
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,900
Rym: See that's how anime fandom and manga fandom for me leveled up.

941
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:42,940
Rym: It was from casual fan to voracious fan immediately.

942
00:44:43,442 --> 00:44:46,300
Rym: And then the next level up was when I realized there were fansubs.

943
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,192
Scott: Yeah, but think about how I was in that late high school where I was just watching whatever was on TV.

944
00:44:50,745 --> 00:44:50,917
Rym: Yup.

945
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,999
Scott: That's how most people are.

946
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,351
Scott: Period.

947
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,919
Scott: They never advanced beyond that.

948
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,660
Scott: I only advanced because I actively went to RIT Anime Club.

949
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,240
Rym: Now this is my problem with conventions like Otakon.

950
00:45:01,601 --> 00:45:02,460
Rym: To bring it back around.

951
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,620
Rym: Because you know we always complain, it's not the punk kids that bother me.

952
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,600
Rym: It's not, you know, the kids can have their fun.

953
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,000
Rym: There's nothing wrong with all that convention culture.

954
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:19,620
Rym: What bothers me is that the conventions, as they are run, do not in any way gently push people toward getting more into anime.

955
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,580
Scott: Yeah, the RIT Anime Club succeeded in leveling me up, if not for it.

956
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:33,620
Scott: If I had gone to some other school, I would have pretty much just been watching anime on TV, not even realizing dubs vs subs was an issue kind of guy.

957
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,860
Rym: And instead, look what happened.

958
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:35,840
Rym: We did GeekNights.

959
00:45:36,182 --> 00:45:38,900
Rym: We lecture in front of thousands of anime conventions.

960
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,260
Scott: Now I know more about anime than most people in this country.

961
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:48,397
Rym: In fact, we were complimented by a professor who studies anime and someone who worked on Minky Momo.

962
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,280
Rym: In fact, was the main person behind Minky Momo on our surprising knowledge of anime.

963
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,300
Rym: I wish I could have introduced that guy to Gerald Surratt, Gerald and Clarissa.

964
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,299
Rym: Or Mike Tull.

965
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,080
Scott: Yeah, because we know more than most in this country.

966
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:05,020
Scott: It's not saying much because there are a zillion people who know more than we do.

967
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,740
Rym: Anime, we're like a B6, like Black Shade 6, I'd say.

968
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,420
Rym: Gerald, they're like Gray 5.

969
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:12,919
Scott: Yeah, who knows.

970
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,098
Scott: Yeah, but I don't know.

971
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,280
Rym: But anyway, I guess the conventions don't do a good job of pushing people.

972
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,600
Rym: And you know why we leveled up at RIT Anime?

973
00:46:21,682 --> 00:46:22,379
Rym: It was very simple.

974
00:46:23,002 --> 00:46:25,020
Rym: They would tell us a little bit about the show.

975
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,879
Rym: They'd show us a random show and they'd be like, "Yeah, this was done by so and

976
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:28,960
Rym: so.".

977
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,628
Scott: They didn't do enough, though.

978
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,000
Rym: No, they did the bare minimum, though.

979
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:36,300
Rym: They'd make in-jokes even if you didn't get them.

980
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:41,757
Rym: They'd show us the touch movie and they'd be like, "This is probably one of the most depressing things you're ever going to see outside of

981
00:46:41,858 --> 00:46:42,059
Rym: EVA.".

982
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,279
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, it's like Anime World Order was the second level up, right?

983
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,579
Scott: As soon as you listen to their show, it's like, "Oh, I should pay attention to who the director

984
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:49,720
Scott: is.".

985
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,279
Scott: And then you're fully leveled up.

986
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,629
Rym: But go back to RIT Anime.

987
00:46:52,931 --> 00:46:54,080
Rym: when you wanted to check out tapes.

988
00:46:54,241 --> 00:47:01,980
Rym: After I'd watched every show I already knew about, I'd be looking around and one of the older guys who was running the club at the time, because we were just young punk freshmen.

989
00:47:02,944 --> 00:47:08,580
Rym: We were called the Front Row Crew because we were a group of assholes who sat in the front row and heckled and made noise.

990
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,120
Rym: And they thought about kicking us out of the club.

991
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:12,979
Rym: And then we took the club over and ran it for many years.

992
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,399
Rym: But we were just punk kids and I'd be standing there looking through the anime and I didn't recognize any of it.

993
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:22,018
Rym: And the older guys would be like, "Hey, you should watch

994
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:22,260
Rym: this.".

995
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,754
Rym: And they'd give me K.O.

996
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,380
Rym: Century Beasts.

997
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,373
Rym: I'd be like, "What's it

998
00:47:25,414 --> 00:47:25,599
Rym: about?".

999
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,370
Rym: They'd be like, "Just watch

1000
00:47:26,451 --> 00:47:26,492
Rym: it.".

1001
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:27,738
Rym: And I did.

1002
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:33,199
Rym: And that alone got me into whole swaths of anime that I never would have seen.

1003
00:47:34,422 --> 00:47:39,020
Scott: I did watch a whole bunch of stuff at RIT Anime Club that I never would have seen.

1004
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,440
Scott: Like, say, Kishinkou.

1005
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:41,703
Scott: Kuu.

1006
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:43,711
Scott: Which I still can't find.

1007
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:44,620
Scott: Kuu for the life of me.

1008
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,038
Scott: If I hadn't seen it there, I never would have seen it.

1009
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,700
Scott: Or Horror's Prince of Sun, right?

1010
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,579
Scott: But it was like, I still didn't really fully get them until later.

1011
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,017
Rym: No, Anime World Order was the next level up.

1012
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,079
Scott: It wasn't until much later that I appreciated what I had seen.

1013
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:05,440
Rym: I mean, I think back that I had access to all of such classics as Marmalade Boy or Kimiguri Orange Road.

1014
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:06,473
Scott: Yeah, right?

1015
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,120
Rym: I mean, I watched a lot of that anime and it was because people just told me to.

1016
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,113
Rym: And I was like, "Okay, I trust these people.

1017
00:48:12,153 --> 00:48:12,958
Rym: They know more than I

1018
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:13,119
Rym: do.".

1019
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:15,620
Rym: And manga, that was the same thing.

1020
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,380
Rym: Like, I was into manga, but I only read manga that I already knew.

1021
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:24,240
Scott: Yeah, I pretty much started out buying mangas that went along with animes that I already was watching.

1022
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,200
Scott: Like, I bought the Initial D manga.

1023
00:48:26,661 --> 00:48:28,300
Scott: I bought the Akira manga.

1024
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,760
Rym: My level up was very specific.

1025
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,478
Rym: It was Luke and Scojo.

1026
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:39,327
Rym: One day we were at a convention, like an Otakon, and we were walking around and one of them said something like, "You gotta look in the dollar bins.

1027
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:41,355
Rym: That's where you find the crazy stuff like

1028
00:48:41,676 --> 00:48:42,359
Rym: Sanctuary.".

1029
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:43,832
Rym: And I was like, "What's

1030
00:48:43,872 --> 00:48:44,559
Rym: Sanctuary?".

1031
00:48:45,144 --> 00:48:47,340
Rym: And I read the first volume of Sanctuary.

1032
00:48:47,982 --> 00:48:49,272
Rym: And that was the moment of revelation.

1033
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,856
Rym: I was like, "There's manga like

1034
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:52,038
Rym: this?".

1035
00:48:55,123 --> 00:49:02,197
Scott: I believe it was more something along the lines of someone was like, "Yeah, there's a manga about a yakuza and a politician and something,

1036
00:49:02,377 --> 00:49:02,779
Scott: something.".

1037
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:06,200
Scott: And we eventually found it, and then we were in business.

1038
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:12,260
Rym: It was mostly that we were told to look in discount bins because you'll find the good stuff there.

1039
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:18,439
Rym: And we were given a small list of awesome titles, which led us to other awesome titles, which eventually led us to...

1040
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,760
Scott: Yeah, well, they definitely led us to the eagle direction as well.

1041
00:49:21,021 --> 00:49:24,320
Rym: And then eventually we started to notice who wrote things.

1042
00:49:24,981 --> 00:49:25,979
Scott: That wasn't until much later.

1043
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,500
Rym: Yeah, but it happened.

1044
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:32,299
Scott: But yeah, mangas, I bought them at Borders, and I was only buying a few.

1045
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:38,060
Scott: And then I started going to the comic shop, so I was seeing some more mangas at the comic shop and also media play.

1046
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:42,820
Scott: But there were only so many that I was actually interested in, and I was pretty picky.

1047
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:53,340
Scott: But then, finally, when I got out of RIT and I had a whole pile of money, I was going to the physical comic shop in New York City every week.

1048
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:59,180
Scott: And then eventually, when I couldn't go there anymore because I moved to Beacon, I was doing a mail order from the same shop.

1049
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,264
Scott: And then I said, "Wait a minute.

1050
00:50:00,284 --> 00:50:03,278
Scott: If I'm mail ordering, I can mail order from this other place for half

1051
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:03,580
Scott: price.".

1052
00:50:04,903 --> 00:50:07,200
Scott: But because I was doing that, I was seeing the order form.

1053
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,620
Scott: So I knew at that point every single manga that was coming out every single month.

1054
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,307
Scott: Because a lot of people, even comic fans, right?

1055
00:50:16,482 --> 00:50:19,736
Scott: They're basically the equivalent of what I was to anime in high school.

1056
00:50:19,756 --> 00:50:20,620
Scott: They'll watch it on TV.

1057
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:25,380
Scott: So these people in comics, they go to the comic shop and they look at the shelf every week, right?

1058
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,338
Scott: And they just buy what they see, what they like, like I was doing at Comics Etc.

1059
00:50:29,398 --> 00:50:29,800
Scott: in Rochester.

1060
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:36,940
Scott: And the problem with that is that the vast majority of comic shops, like 99%, don't buy everything there is.

1061
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,778
Scott: They can't afford to buy everything there is.

1062
00:50:39,322 --> 00:50:42,319
Scott: So if you just look at the shelf, you won't know everything there is.

1063
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,999
Scott: And the only way for you to know everything there is, is to get that stupid fucking catalog for four dollars.

1064
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:51,500
Scott: Or do the online ordering with the place that gives you the spreadsheet that I get.

1065
00:50:52,421 --> 00:50:52,622
Scott: Right?

1066
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:55,640
Scott: Or, and even then, they'll sell you the stupid catalog.

1067
00:50:55,781 --> 00:51:00,440
Scott: Or send you free copies of the stupid catalog without you asking for it and filling up your trash bin.

1068
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:04,960
Scott: But once you get that, you can see everything that's coming out.

1069
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,658
Scott: And you can say, "Look at all these mangas that are being printed in English that I don't even know

1070
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:09,040
Scott: existed.".

1071
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,416
Scott: Or, "Look at all these comics coming out from indie publishers that I don't even know

1072
00:51:12,456 --> 00:51:12,818
Scott: existed.".

1073
00:51:13,564 --> 00:51:14,860
Rym: Ah, the indie publishers.

1074
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:22,420
Scott: And that is like the highest level that you can get, is now you see with your eyeballs every comic that is available to you.

1075
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,660
Scott: And also the webcomics, don't leave out the webcomics either, right?

1076
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,542
Scott: Which I started reading.

1077
00:51:26,562 --> 00:51:32,380
Scott: since the year 2000, I've been reading many, many webcomics every single day.

1078
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,266
Rym: It was really at RIT.

1079
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:34,676
Rym: You know what got us into webcomics?

1080
00:51:34,696 --> 00:51:35,280
Rym: Like, for real?

1081
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,920
Rym: It was back then, Mega Tokyo and Penny Arcade.

1082
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:40,699
Rym: And real life comics.

1083
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,540
Scott: I gotta be perfectly honest, it was pretty much just Mega Tokyo.

1084
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:47,860
Scott: Somehow I ended up at it, and I was reading it every day.

1085
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,659
Rym: We all read it and talked about it.

1086
00:51:50,201 --> 00:51:51,890
Rym: We were like, "Oh man, did you read Mega Tokyo?

1087
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,156
Rym: Yeah, I wonder what's gonna happen.

1088
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:53,438
Rym: Oh man,

1089
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:53,820
Rym: Margo.".

1090
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:59,298
Scott: And even in those earliest of days, like for a couple months, I was like, "Fuck your 8-bit theater and your Penny

1091
00:51:59,358 --> 00:51:59,699
Scott: Arcade.".

1092
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,520
Rym: Yeah, I was reading 8-bit theater because I found that shit hilarious.

1093
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,300
Scott: But not everyone else did.

1094
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:06,100
Scott: I was not a fan of those immediately.

1095
00:52:06,641 --> 00:52:10,300
Scott: I think I was against them the same way I was against all the other comics in the comic shop.

1096
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,033
Rym: Yeah, it was basically, I hit Mega Tokyo and I was like, "Oh shit!

1097
00:52:13,456 --> 00:52:14,220
Rym: Webcomics!".

1098
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,619
Rym: And then I read a million webcomics, realized they all sucked, parroted it down, pretty much like real life, 8-bit theater.

1099
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,138
Scott: I added all these webcomics because I was like, "Webcomics are a

1100
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:23,340
Scott: thing!".

1101
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,360
Scott: So I started getting a whole bunch of them, and then I got rid of a bunch of them.

1102
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,920
Scott: And some of them ended and some of them started.

1103
00:52:28,544 --> 00:52:28,979
Scott: Do you remember?

1104
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,820
Rym: 8 Bad Boys of Computer Science.

1105
00:52:31,044 --> 00:52:31,640
Rym: That's right!

1106
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:35,600
Rym: We gave that fucker from the Bad Boys of Computer Science money.

1107
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,000
Scott: The greatest, worst webcomic in all of history.

1108
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,138
Rym: It wasn't that great, but one.

1109
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:41,850
Scott: Actually, it was pretty great.

1110
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,820
Scott: Not you too, Tribes 2.

1111
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:49,040
Rym: Other than the fact that they drank heavily, the characters, it was very similar to our experiences at RIT.

1112
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:53,359
Rym: And they also were as obsessed with Tribes 2 as we were.

1113
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,584
Rym: That was it.

1114
00:52:55,652 --> 00:52:56,620
Rym: That's the main reason.

1115
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,675
Scott: Bad Boys of Computer Science was the shit.

1116
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,951
Rym: It was that, real life, 8-bit theater.

1117
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:02,320
Rym: I read College Roomies from Hell.

1118
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,028
Rym: So did Greg.

1119
00:53:03,069 --> 00:53:03,860
Rym: Almost no one else did.

1120
00:53:03,942 --> 00:53:04,419
Scott: I didn't read that.

1121
00:53:05,322 --> 00:53:07,659
Rym: I remember reading a lot of weird stuff, like Not Gonna Take It.

1122
00:53:08,182 --> 00:53:10,180
Rym: That was done by Meredith Grin back in the day.

1123
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,957
Scott: Alright, so here's the webcomics I'm reading right now.

1124
00:53:12,038 --> 00:53:12,200
Scott: Ready?

1125
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,240
Scott: Those are all newspaper comics that happen also on the web.

1126
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:15,325
Rym: Dr.

1127
00:53:15,347 --> 00:53:15,539
Rym: McGinja.

1128
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,908
Scott: Alright, so real life, Penny Arcade, Dr.

1129
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:28,380
Scott: McGinja, XKCD, Wondermark, Johnny Wander, Order of the Stick, Freak Angels, Gun Show, Hark of Vagrant, Axe Cop, Gastrophobia, which I talked about recently.

1130
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,660
Rym: I really like Gastrophobia.

1131
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,979
Rym: And do you know what has returned?

1132
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:32,060
Rym: What has returned?

1133
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,260
Scott: The greatest webcomic of all time.

1134
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,600
Rym: The Bad Boys of Computer Science?

1135
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:36,057
Scott: No.

1136
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,699
Scott: The Boy on a Stick.

1137
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:38,482
Scott: Oh.

1138
00:53:39,623 --> 00:53:40,056
Scott: And Slither.

1139
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,459
Rym: I've given up on Boases.

1140
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,739
Scott: He's got a new art style too.

1141
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,259
Rym: We used to be really into Boases.

1142
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,132
Scott: Yeah, he's got a new art style and everything.

1143
00:53:46,635 --> 00:53:47,220
Scott: It's pretty awesome.

1144
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:48,036
Scott: Alright.

1145
00:53:48,581 --> 00:53:49,319
Rym: Yeah, you like that?

1146
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,380
Rym: But all that started from Mega Tokyo.

1147
00:53:52,561 --> 00:54:00,660
Rym: So, never ever actually legitimately make fun of some kid who gets into anime from Naruto, because that's how most people get into everything.

1148
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:05,320
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing wrong, right, with the guy who gets into something through something stupid, right?

1149
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,420
Scott: Who moves on to the hardcore from a casual thing, right?

1150
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,360
Scott: Everyone, even the hardest core guy, started out with something lame, right?

1151
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,780
Scott: No one starts out just playing Battletech out of the womb, right?

1152
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,740
Scott: They played Monopoly and then Risk and then something else, right?

1153
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,060
Scott: I mean, who plays Battletech first thing?

1154
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,710
Rym: I was into board games for most of my life.

1155
00:54:23,811 --> 00:54:25,280
Rym: I was hardcore into Monopoly.

1156
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,120
Rym: I would play full Monopoly games against myself to try and solve it.

1157
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:34,956
Scott: I mean, all that time that I was buying those superhero cards and those comic books, you know what I was spending even more money on?

1158
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:36,979
Scott: Magic the fucking gathering.

1159
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:43,060
Scott: So, I mean, while I look down on it now, it was still, it had its purpose.

1160
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,320
Scott: And the only thing you gotta look down on is not starting in these things.

1161
00:54:47,422 --> 00:54:48,079
Scott: They shouldn't exist.

1162
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,440
Scott: It's that failing to move on from those things.

1163
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,300
Scott: If I was still playing Magic now, that would be sad.

1164
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,700
Rym: I can't blame people who don't move on because they're never presented with it.

1165
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,920
Rym: Because look at all the things we're into.

1166
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,000
Scott: If I was still reading Mega Tokyo now, that'd be sad.

1167
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,259
Rym: But at the same time, look at us.

1168
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,320
Rym: Most of our leveling ups were external things.

1169
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:08,140
Rym: Like, we would put in the first half of the effort, like, I'll go to RIT anime.

1170
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,519
Rym: But RIT anime returned with the second half.

1171
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,180
Rym: Mega Tokyo still exists.

1172
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:11,907
Rym: Here's some shit.

1173
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:13,180
Rym: Like, here's stuff.

1174
00:55:13,901 --> 00:55:18,580
Rym: There was this kind of event that would push us to the next level at every step of the way.

1175
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:23,700
Scott: Yeah, it's like, I put in one half of the effort, which was, this RIT is clearly a nerdy school.

1176
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,080
Scott: It has an anime club, it has computers, I wanna go there.

1177
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,560
Scott: And then I actually went to those clubs, and that was the extent of my beginning efforts.

1178
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,495
Rym: So look at conventions.

1179
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,100
Scott: Oh, and when I went to the RWAG, I said, I wanna play D&D and raise my hand.

1180
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,140
Scott: That was the extent of my efforts.

1181
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:45,180
Rym: Yup, and RWAG said, here's a guy who's smoked more weed than he should've, who's going to run one and a half awesome sessions of Dungeons & Dragons.

1182
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,139
Scott: And if that guy was a horrible guy, dammit that guy.

1183
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:49,031
Rym: You know what?

1184
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,080
Scott: If not for that guy, we would not be here today.

1185
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,680
Rym: No GeekNights, no front row crew, none of this would've happened.

1186
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,879
Scott: If not for that lame guy.

1187
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:03,020
Scott: So it is always a lame thing that is going to get you somehow started in the awesomeness.

1188
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,160
Rym: So let's end on, cause we know it's Wednesday, getting into conventions.

1189
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,859
Scott: Something like X-Men TV show.

1190
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:15,920
Rym: Because I just complained about how I don't think anime conventions do a good job of providing the second half of the effort to get people more into it.

1191
00:56:16,282 --> 00:56:18,960
Rym: And as a result, they're kind of falling in many ways.

1192
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,500
Rym: But look at a con like the Penny Arcade Expo.

1193
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,760
Rym: A lot of people go there and say things like, I've never played an indie RPG, but holy shit, look at those indie RPGs.

1194
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:35,760
Scott: Yeah, but there also are a lot of people who go to those conventions and they'll sit there and they'll just do the one thing that they want to do and that's it.

1195
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,580
Rym: But they don't put forth the effort.

1196
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,079
Rym: They don't put forth the first half and say, I wanna try something new.

1197
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,960
Scott: The first half was coming to PAX, that was the first half.

1198
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:49,080
Rym: I don't know, I feel like now you've gotta settle for the first half is expressing even the tiniest of interest in anything.

1199
00:56:50,024 --> 00:56:51,520
Rym: And you gotta just follow up from there.

1200
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,620
Scott: I mean, how many guys go to PAX and stay in the expo hall the entirety of the time and never leave it?

1201
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:03,395
Rym: I think a lot of the people I see who are playing the single player games at the conventions, it's really an issue of.

1202
00:57:03,776 --> 00:57:05,940
Rym: they're not super social and they came to the con alone.

1203
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:10,240
Rym: They don't know how to strike up a conversation.

1204
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,884
Scott: Well, also think about this, right?

1205
00:57:12,004 --> 00:57:13,488
Scott: If I was a little kid, right?

1206
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:18,380
Scott: When you would go to Toys R Us, there would be like a Super Nintendo there with Super Metroid and you'd be like, oh motherfucker.

1207
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,420
Rym: I'd be there until my parents dragged me out.

1208
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:20,981
Scott: That's right.

1209
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:29,900
Scott: Now, imagine if you still had that mindset and you went to PAX, you could go into the console free play, ask for all these games that your parents wouldn't buy you that you don't have.

1210
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:31,920
Scott: You could check them out and just play them.

1211
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,861
Rym: Yeah, but these dudes are like 30.

1212
00:57:33,861 --> 00:57:44,900
Scott: I'm just saying is that, you know, that would be, you know, if you still had that mindset of stay at the Super Nintendo demo machine for three hours, then console free play at PAX is freaking amazing to you.

1213
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,720
Scott: Because you could just be like, give me give me a fucking fucking Soul Calibur and you just, oh my God, I got Soul Calibur.

1214
00:57:51,842 --> 00:57:54,460
Rym: So, but how did we start with all this though?

1215
00:57:55,081 --> 00:57:58,393
Rym: You know, we never heard as much as I was into anime.

1216
00:57:58,834 --> 00:58:00,480
Rym: I didn't even know anime conventions existed.

1217
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,740
Scott: Well, I mean, I sort of understood, you know, from watching TV that there was like Star Trek conventions.

1218
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:06,581
Rym: Exactly.

1219
00:58:06,661 --> 00:58:14,855
Rym: I knew that there were two, there were three kinds of conventions, professional conventions that were boring, Star Trek conventions and gaming cons.

1220
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:17,880
Rym: because I went to gaming cons from little kids of mine.

1221
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,080
Scott: I did go to a Magic the Gathering tournament event once.

1222
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,539
Rym: I went to many of those.

1223
00:58:22,681 --> 00:58:23,359
Scott: Right, in middle school.

1224
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:30,256
Rym: But I also went to like Michicon, just straight up, this was a con where you pay per event and I played like eight hour D&D games.

1225
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:32,440
Rym: Everyone there was fat and 40.

1226
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,340
Scott: I didn't know that kind of thing existed until much later.

1227
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,845
Rym: I knew, but I didn't know there was anime.

1228
00:58:35,905 --> 00:58:39,700
Rym: Like it never even crossed my mind that there would be an anime equivalent of those gaming cons.

1229
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,006
Scott: I didn't even fully understand that there was a convention.

1230
00:58:42,026 --> 00:58:47,460
Scott: Like I saw on TV there would be references to Star Trek conventions, not, you know, like in other shows that were nerdy.

1231
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,212
Scott: So I was like, oh, I guess there are Star Trek things.

1232
00:58:50,413 --> 00:58:51,900
Scott: I didn't like Star Trek, so I didn't care.

1233
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,422
Rym: I didn't know until I went to one.

1234
00:58:53,463 --> 00:59:04,200
Rym: The first Michicon I went to, I brought all my D&D books and I brought all these characters because I was like, what I have to, I think I thought I had to bring my characters and I brought all my Magic cards.

1235
00:59:06,402 --> 00:59:08,531
Rym: And I look, I didn't, I was like, how do I play a game?

1236
00:59:08,571 --> 00:59:10,499
Rym: And this fat guy was like, you got to go sign up.

1237
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:14,900
Rym: So I go and I pay my like five bucks and I signed up for this Magic tournament that I lost.

1238
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,360
Rym: And then I signed up for this eight hour long D&D game that was part of a tournament.

1239
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:24,860
Rym: And this Dungeon Master dude ran this tournament D&D session where we like busted into a pyramid.

1240
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:28,572
Rym: And that was like this moment of realization.

1241
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:31,260
Rym: I was like, this is the awesomest thing ever.

1242
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:33,809
Rym: I'm here far away from home.

1243
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:36,700
Rym: It's like two in the morning, no parents.

1244
00:59:37,681 --> 00:59:38,865
Rym: I'm playing D&D.

1245
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:40,711
Rym: Oh my God.

1246
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:43,540
Rym: And I just kept going to gaming cons.

1247
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,694
Rym: And then at RIT one day someone was like, hey, you want to go to an anime convention?

1248
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:54,160
Scott: Well, I mean like at RIT, they always during the announcements, they would say things about conventions, right?

1249
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,940
Rym: But they would say like Otakon is coming and I'd be like, I didn't know what that was.

1250
00:59:58,522 --> 01:00:00,509
Scott: They weren't exactly explicit.

1251
01:00:00,569 --> 01:00:10,100
Scott: Like no one ever said like there is a thing called a convention, a whole bunch of nerds get together in a hotel or convention center, you pay an admission fee and all these things are there.

1252
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,006
Rym: And this might sound crazy.

1253
01:00:11,026 --> 01:00:12,958
Rym: They were so unexpected that I didn't know.

1254
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,950
Rym: I feel like we're going to Otakon.

1255
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:16,320
Rym: And I was like, I don't even know what that is.

1256
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,879
Scott: I completely glossed over what they were saying, like I didn't care and I didn't get it.

1257
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,542
Scott: And they weren't.

1258
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,414
Scott: so, you know, they didn't say it very well.

1259
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,920
Scott: So I didn't comprehend it completely.

1260
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,800
Scott: And then somehow someone was like, we're going to Ohio con, you know, do you want to go to Ohio con?

1261
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,709
Scott: And I was like, and I sort of finally got it.

1262
01:00:33,749 --> 01:00:37,100
Scott: Like there's going to be some sort of anime event.

1263
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,248
Rym: Here's what I was told.

1264
01:00:38,328 --> 01:00:39,640
Rym: I remember this pretty clearly.

1265
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:47,739
Rym: I don't remember which of the upperclassmen who are now part of the front row crew told us this, but I remember because, you know, back then I didn't know them.

1266
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:52,880
Rym: So they're just like faceless entities that told me stuff all the time, vaguely authoritative.

1267
01:00:53,364 --> 01:00:54,353
Scott: Perhaps they were a blur?

1268
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,124
Rym: There was a time.

1269
01:00:56,165 --> 01:00:56,889
Rym: Oh my God.

1270
01:00:56,909 --> 01:00:58,679
Rym: I forgot all about him.

1271
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:06,640
Rym: Ken Hashimoto, the blur, who stole mosh mosh revolution from us, which is fine.

1272
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:07,463
Rym: You're allowed to.

1273
01:01:07,623 --> 01:01:10,476
Rym: Ideas are worth nothing, but took credit for it himself.

1274
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:11,480
Rym: Anyway.

1275
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,698
Rym: So one of those people, I mean, we used to look up to Scott Johnson as an authority figure.

1276
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:26,647
Rym: So I got, I was under the impression from these people that anime conventions, Ohio con would consist of the following.

1277
01:01:27,189 --> 01:01:29,500
Rym: There's tons of girls there in cosplay.

1278
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:30,423
Rym: What is that?

1279
01:01:30,624 --> 01:01:31,087
Rym: They're cute.

1280
01:01:32,034 --> 01:01:32,900
Rym: There's gaming there.

1281
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:36,859
Rym: There is a place where artists just draw anime shit and you can buy it.

1282
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:38,326
Rym: And it's awesome.

1283
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,160
Rym: You can buy anime shit and it's awesome.

1284
01:01:42,621 --> 01:01:43,325
Rym: You'll get laid.

1285
01:01:43,345 --> 01:01:45,559
Rym: I was told all these things.

1286
01:01:46,563 --> 01:01:48,499
Rym: Oh, and you can watch anime there.

1287
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:56,112
Scott: See, I had gone to youth group conventions in high school where you were also told that you would be laid, but there was no nerdiness going on there.

1288
01:01:56,795 --> 01:01:57,720
Scott: It was just awesomeness.

1289
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:58,543
Rym: So what do we do?

1290
01:01:58,724 --> 01:01:59,589
Rym: We're so pumped.

1291
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:04,680
Rym: The whole, almost like half the front row crew, we all go to this convention in Ohio.

1292
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,918
Scott: And most of what we wanted to do was play DDR.

1293
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:07,621
Rym: Yep.

1294
01:02:07,681 --> 01:02:09,639
Rym: So because DDR, like there were no DDR machines.

1295
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,180
Scott: That was when the DDR iron was the hottest.

1296
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,490
Rym: There were no DDR machines.

1297
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:14,660
Rym: We were like desperate.

1298
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,246
Rym: We would like freak out.

1299
01:02:16,286 --> 01:02:24,500
Rym: Like I'd get, someone would IM me on aim and be like, I heard there's DDR and people would like flock to a mall to find a broken pump it up machine.

1300
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:32,559
Rym: So we go to this con, we drive to goddamn motherfucking Ohio to go to Ohio con and we walk in.

1301
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:38,440
Rym: And it was one of the most disappointing experiences of my entire life.

1302
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:40,891
Scott: I wasn't really, I don't know.

1303
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:42,740
Scott: I wasn't disappointed at the time, right?

1304
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:52,300
Scott: But over time of being there, I realized that it was kind of crummy, but it was also the first anime con and there was stuff there that I had not seen.

1305
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,032
Scott: It was like this small sampling.

1306
01:02:54,073 --> 01:03:01,080
Scott: It was like, it was like, it was like you go there expecting a chocolate bar, like a whole Hershey bar and you get just one square of a Hershey bar.

1307
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,247
Rym: But it had everything.

1308
01:03:02,267 --> 01:03:03,134
Rym: Like there was an artist alley.

1309
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:03,900
Rym: I'd never seen that before.

1310
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,147
Rym: Dealers room, never seen that before.

1311
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,059
Rym: I bought fan art and it was awesome.

1312
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,700
Scott: I didn't even think I bought actually a pretty good a Unicron fan art.

1313
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,724
Rym: Yeah, I bought this thing.

1314
01:03:11,764 --> 01:03:14,580
Rym: It was like Vasht the Stampede and knives as punk kids.

1315
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,179
Scott: I bought a volume of Trigun Dojinshi that I thought was actual Trigun manga, but wasn't.

1316
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,358
Rym: Yeah, I remember that.

1317
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,880
Scott: I bought a Apollo World that you can zip her up into a Pokeball for a dollar.

1318
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:33,139
Rym: But all is not lost because while it, you know, we say it was this worst convention, really in retrospect, it was just very poorly run.

1319
01:03:33,681 --> 01:03:34,359
Scott: Really poorly run?

1320
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,220
Rym: The number of anecdotes that came out of that convention was legendary.

1321
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,897
Rym: That's where the Duck Hunt tournament happened.

1322
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,819
Rym: That we all won.

1323
01:03:40,961 --> 01:03:42,380
Scott: That's where we played Settlers and Midget Whores.

1324
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,600
Scott: No exaggeration, no hyperbole whatsoever.

1325
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:49,779
Rym: I can't believe, to this day I look back on that and I'm like, that's the kind of bullshit story I would make up.

1326
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,040
Rym: And yet, not only did it happen, but you were there.

1327
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,560
Rym: And you would call me on it if we made that shit up.

1328
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:05,260
Scott: We absolutely, 100%, no exaggeration or hyperbole or lying or anything, played Settlers of Catan with a midget whore and a non-midget ugly whore.

1329
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:07,659
Rym: She wasn't that ugly, she was just old.

1330
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,260
Scott: I mean, you know, she wasn't a hot whore.

1331
01:04:09,301 --> 01:04:09,796
Scott: She was a whore.

1332
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:10,232
Scott: Yeah.

1333
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:10,998
Rym: Straight up.

1334
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,900
Scott: A whore and a midget whore.

1335
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:14,599
Rym: Oh my god, the whores.

1336
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,839
Rym: There were so many whores.

1337
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:19,038
Scott: We're not even exact, literally whores.

1338
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:29,100
Rym: And independently, cosplay girls trying to "hook up" with people but really didn't have rooms and just needed somewhere to sleep.

1339
01:04:29,905 --> 01:04:32,300
Scott: Oh, and there was Stevie Beast's Catgirls.

1340
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,040
Rym: Oh my god.

1341
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:38,000
Scott: And there was the really tall Sailor Moon crossdress and Sailor Bubba and yeah.

1342
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:38,814
Rym: Oh yeah.

1343
01:04:39,763 --> 01:04:41,539
Rym: But then, from there we levelled up.

1344
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,260
Rym: We gave AnimeCon a second chance.

1345
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,571
Rym: Someone was like, "No, we gotta go to

1346
01:04:44,713 --> 01:04:45,178
Rym: Otakon.".

1347
01:04:45,805 --> 01:04:48,121
Scott: And we went to Otakon 02.

1348
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:49,720
Rym: And it was mind-blowing.

1349
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,280
Scott: That was the real deal.

1350
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,929
Rym: And I remember we got so excited because eventually we were like, "They're gonna let us be panelists.

1351
01:04:55,111 --> 01:04:56,560
Rym: We're gonna be on the Anime Club Summit.

1352
01:04:56,721 --> 01:04:57,007
Rym: Oh my

1353
01:04:57,088 --> 01:04:57,556
Rym: god!".

1354
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:04,360
Rym: And now, we basically... Well, Otakon probably won't ever let us come back.

1355
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:05,539
Scott: No, but other people do.

1356
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:05,893
Scott: Yeah.

1357
01:05:07,482 --> 01:05:11,819
Rym: But, you know, that's how we got into doing panels and how GeekNights kind of formed as well.

1358
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:13,579
Rym: I think we've talked enough.

1359
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:14,280
Scott: We've talked enough.

1360
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,380
Scott: The point is, you know, we all started with stupid shit.

1361
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,920
Scott: But, don't make a mistake.

1362
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:26,174
Scott: A lot of people, you know, they think, "Aha, I started with something stupid and I want to introduce this person to my

1363
01:05:26,215 --> 01:05:26,658
Scott: geekery.".

1364
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:28,740
Scott: Don't start them off with something stupid.

1365
01:05:29,301 --> 01:05:30,160
Rym: Unless you're an expert.

1366
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,100
Rym: Experts can start people with something stupid.

1367
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,278
Scott: Yeah, it's like I started...

1368
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,260
Rym: I mean, Fist of the North Star is stupid.

1369
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,579
Rym: Don't even pretend it's not.

1370
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,300
Rym: I love it, but it is stupid.

1371
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:46,240
Scott: It's like the first anime I ever saw was a bad dub of some piece of crap on, like, you know, Project Aco.

1372
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,291
Scott: Well, what happens?

1373
01:05:47,332 --> 01:05:47,960
Rym: Here's the failing.

1374
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,019
Rym: One, the dub's not that bad.

1375
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,980
Scott: Yeah, no, but I'm saying, you know, that doesn't mean that you should start your friend off on Project Aco.

1376
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,620
Rym: Well, here's why I'm saying experts.

1377
01:05:54,660 --> 01:06:01,840
Rym: Only pros can get away with that, because it wasn't the crappy fan sub of Aco that was the moment.

1378
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,460
Rym: Like, that wasn't good in and of itself.

1379
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,140
Rym: You have to recreate the whole experience.

1380
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:17,600
Rym: Like, a lot of the crappy anime that I watched early on, the reason it worked and made me more interested in anime is because I watched it late at night after playing D&D in a dark basement with a bunch of my nerd friends.

1381
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:19,335
Scott: And also because it was rare.

1382
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,780
Rym: Yeah, it was weird.

1383
01:06:21,122 --> 01:06:22,180
Scott: It was no other way to get it.

1384
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,260
Scott: Weird, different, and difficult to obtain.

1385
01:06:23,381 --> 01:06:31,258
Rym: So unless you can replicate all those factors, showing someone the crappy fan sub, anime that itself is crap objectively, it's not going to work.

1386
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,560
Rym: So unless you're a pro, show them Cowboy Bebop.

1387
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,159
Scott: That's right.

1388
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,500
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1389
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:47,600
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
