1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,666
Rym: It's Wednesday, September 28th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,392
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:13,395
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:14,880
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,724
Rym: Tonight, the GeekNights worst webcomic contest of 2011.

6
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:19,465
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:29,539
Scott: So, you know, we're in New York City.

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,021
Rym: We are.

9
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:31,790
Scott: You can get any food you want in the universe.

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,133
Rym: Pretty much anything.

11
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:37,930
Rym: I had, uh, for lunch I had Mexican food, and last night for dinner I had curry.

12
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:40,339
Rym: And the previous day I had Mexican food.

13
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:42,610
Rym: And the day before that I had Mexican food.

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,974
Scott: Good job with the Mexican food.

15
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:48,150
Scott: Anyway, so I really hadn't had a burger in like a few weeks.

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,564
Scott: I was like, "I'm getting a burger for lunch,

17
00:00:49,604 --> 00:00:49,908
Scott: bitches.".

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,781
Rym: The thing is, New York, it's like the burger is one of our things.

19
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,870
Rym: The burger joint.

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,033
Scott: Well, here's the problem.

21
00:00:56,795 --> 00:01:01,150
Scott: There are no burger places close enough to my work, right?

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,990
Scott: It's like I could go to the Shake Shack on Broadway, but I think it's on 8th, near the Port Authority.

23
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,030
Rym: If you go to Schnippers, it's not that far from you.

24
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,250
Scott: Schnippers, that's still kind of far to go to Schnippers, which is even, which is a couple blocks further than Shake Shack.

25
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,490
Rym: Scott, I used to walk to Schnippers from my office.

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,442
Scott: You're crazy.

27
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:15,910
Scott: Anyway.

28
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:18,010
Rym: I walk about a mile to get a good burger.

29
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,431
Scott: Right.

30
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:21,065
Scott: It's, you know, there was a, you know, I can go to McDonald's.

31
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:22,130
Scott: Fuck that, it doesn't even count.

32
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,697
Scott: Five Guys doesn't even count.

33
00:01:23,998 --> 00:01:26,090
Scott: There's Island Burger, which is amazing.

34
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,679
Scott: But you gotta sit, you gotta sit down at the Island Burger.

35
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:31,210
Scott: It's not, you know, you don't want to take out from the Island Burger.

36
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:35,405
Rym: So there's a place near me, I don't know what it's called, but it's not a chain of any kind.

37
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:36,670
Rym: It's just a burger joint.

38
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,030
Rym: They have burgers, fries, and sweet potato fries, and very little else.

39
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,410
Scott: So one of my co-workers suggested this place that was still kind of far, called Le Parker Meridian.

40
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,154
Scott: Now, here's the deal.

41
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:55,390
Scott: He suggested it, and it was sort of iffy, and I was like, if not now, then when?

42
00:01:57,891 --> 00:01:58,392
Scott: So we went.

43
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:04,728
Scott: So if you go to Carnegie Hall, alright, then you go east, right?

44
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:05,510
Scott: Remember where we went?

45
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,610
Rym: This means nothing to the majority of our listeners.

46
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,669
Scott: Remember we went to see Summer Wars and the Directors Guild?

47
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:10,366
Scott: Oh yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,050
Scott: Immediately next door to that are some glass sliding doors.

49
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:17,820
Scott: And on those glass sliding doors is the tree symbol.

50
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,950
Scott: that is the symbol used on private property when it's open to the public.

51
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,649
Rym: Yup, you get a text brick for that shit.

52
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,332
Scott: Exactly.

53
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:28,070
Scott: So that symbol was sort of embossed by like a laser on these glass automatic doors.

54
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:29,754
Scott: And I'm like, what the fuck is this?

55
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:36,390
Scott: Well, what it is, is you go in there, and there's like a fancy hotel bar, ultra fancy, with music playing, and it's like, whoa.

56
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,789
Scott: Why is there the open to the public sign on those doors, followed by a hotel bar?

57
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,928
Rym: For the tax break.

58
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,943
Scott: There's a hotel called Le Parker Meridian that is le fancy.

59
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:47,650
Scott: Very le fancy, right?

60
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:50,298
Scott: It's on 109 West 56th Street, New York.

61
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,849
Scott: And the entrance to the hotel is on the southern street, the 56th.

62
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,313
Rym: Alright Scott, so give it to me straight.

63
00:02:55,433 --> 00:03:01,990
Rym: On a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being the minimally edible burger, so already above 5 guys.

64
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,578
Scott: You're not, let me finish.

65
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:05,670
Scott: the most important part of the story, is not the burger.

66
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,561
Scott: You go into this hotel, it's ultra fancy.

67
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,889
Scott: You walk through the hotel bar.

68
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:15,101
Scott: You go in, and it's like another hotel seating area, sort of like a hotel lobby.

69
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:18,630
Scott: And it's way fancy, all sorts of crazy modernish styling, right?

70
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:25,490
Scott: And you're looking around, and you go to the concierge, big long concierge desk, it's made of stone, right?

71
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:29,342
Scott: And you look to the right of the concierge desk, and there's a big red curtain.

72
00:03:29,904 --> 00:03:31,750
Scott: And then there's a seating area in front of the red curtain.

73
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:38,625
Scott: There is a tiny, tiny, tiny area in between the red curtain and the concierge desk.

74
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,910
Scott: Like, narrow enough for one person.

75
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,585
Scott: You'd think it was just the way to go into the back behind the concierge desk.

76
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:46,749
Scott: But if you look...

77
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:48,230
Rym: Is that the burger joint?

78
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:55,530
Scott: If you look in this narrow hallway, there is a neon sign, a very small one, and it is neon bent into the shape of a burger.

79
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,950
Scott: Two yellow circles of neon with a little green and a brown and a red neon in the middle of it.

80
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,990
Rym: You know, if this were an anime, this would take you to the burger dimension.

81
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,368
Scott: Maybe six, maybe like six inches square, six inches on each side square neon.

82
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,890
Rym: Scott, did this take you to the burger dimension?

83
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:25,242
Scott: You go down this hallway, and you make a right turn, and suddenly you're in like this normal burger place with stuff written all over the walls, and like movie posters, and a big long line, and people crowded in to a room about the side, maybe twice.

84
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:28,770
Scott: your living room is behind, is hidden in this little hotel.

85
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,950
Scott: It totally is not fancy in any way whatsoever.

86
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,858
Rym: So, Scott, the burger.

87
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,210
Rym: How's the burger?

88
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,590
Scott: It was about the same as Shake Shack.

89
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:37,105
Rym: Okay.

90
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,465
Scott: But, you know, it was...

91
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,010
Rym: It gets points for style.

92
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:47,510
Scott: The style of being hidden behind the curtain in an incredibly fancy, open to the public hotel, lobby-ish area.

93
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,049
Scott: But, yeah, for being so hidden, a lot of people fucking know where it is because it was a line out the door.

94
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:58,784
Scott: And they do shakes, and they got a sign, and the sign is like, you know, "Here's how to order.

95
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:00,729
Scott: If you don't order right, we're sending it to the back of the

96
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:01,070
Scott: line.".

97
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:02,276
Rym: Really?

98
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:03,090
Rym: Super Nazi style?

99
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,677
Scott: Yeah, it's like you have to go, and they're like, "Here's how to order a burger.

100
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:07,462
Scott: Hamburger or cheeseburger.

101
00:05:07,843 --> 00:05:10,270
Scott: Then, you know, medium, rare, well, whatever.

102
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,997
Scott: Then, lettuce, tomato, onion, whatever.

103
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:15,966
Scott: And then, you know, if you don't do it just right, back of the line.

104
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:16,507
Scott: You're taking too

105
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:16,708
Scott: long.".

106
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,030
Scott: I'm thinking they go there, like, on a weekend, and the fries, well, they look like McDonald's fries, and they were that same style.

107
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,000
Scott: They actually had a pretty good flavor to them.

108
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,450
Scott: I think they put something extra on them.

109
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:26,731
Rym: We'll see.

110
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:30,530
Rym: I might be up that way for a meeting on Friday, so I might take a late lunch.

111
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,410
Scott: Don't expect, you know, a fucking amazing burger.

112
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:34,992
Rym: No, no.

113
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:38,590
Rym: I'm expecting a good, solid New York burger joint burger.

114
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:44,030
Scott: It's about the experience of going into the fancy hotel, and there's a secret burger place hidden behind the curtain.

115
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,130
Rym: Perhaps behind a secret tunnel.

116
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,655
Scott: Yeah, that's the reason to go.

117
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:51,166
Scott: Plus, I got a cheeseburger and fries, and it was 12 bucks.

118
00:05:51,547 --> 00:05:52,430
Rym: So, yeah.

119
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,170
Rym: So, as you all know, there's the Thundercats animation.

120
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:56,793
Rym: Oh!

121
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,750
Rym: It's kind of an anime, except it's made for American audiences, and is in English.

122
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,129
Scott: Hey, spirits of evil.

123
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:04,239
Rym: I've been watching it.

124
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,190
Rym: I watched the first three episodes.

125
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,210
Scott: No, watch the first one episode.

126
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,728
Rym: It's okay.

127
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:07,710
Rym: All right.

128
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,084
Rym: My Geek Bite of it, the best I can say is okay.

129
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:13,657
Rym: It has... It's really well animated.

130
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:14,702
Rym: Like, it looks really good.

131
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,550
Rym: I really like the character designs.

132
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:19,829
Rym: And I like the kind of aesthetic and where it's going.

133
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,262
Scott: I didn't see enough Mumrah yet.

134
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,130
Scott: Mumrah's my man.

135
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,730
Rym: Mumrah looked really kind of not scary and pathetic when he was out in the sunlight.

136
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,528
Scott: Oh, that sucks.

137
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:28,762
Scott: I had the best Mumrah toy.

138
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,170
Rym: So, when he's inside, he's some scary shit.

139
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:32,530
Rym: That's good.

140
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,050
Rym: But then he gets knocked through a wall into the outside, and then he just looks like an old man.

141
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:36,525
Scott: Like, ah!

142
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:38,849
Scott: Well, that's how Mumrah was.

143
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:41,090
Scott: So, they're actually being true to the original Mumrah.

144
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,936
Scott: But I had the best Mumrah toy.

145
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:46,430
Scott: It was like, I had the full-size action figure of Mumrah the Everliving.

146
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,190
Rym: Whoa, I had like no Thundercats toys.

147
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:48,915
Scott: I had a lot.

148
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:50,410
Scott: I had the big castle and everything.

149
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,618
Scott: And then I had this little Mumrah toy.

150
00:06:53,638 --> 00:06:57,150
Scott: It was like a three-inch Mumrah, but it actually came in both forms.

151
00:06:57,592 --> 00:07:00,830
Scott: And it was a little tiny playset where you could spin him around.

152
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,730
Scott: You could spin it around inside the playset to transform his decayed form with ancient spirits.

153
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:09,769
Scott: And it came with a tiny mommutt also.

154
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:17,610
Rym: So, I guess what bothers me about it is that the writing is actually kind of derpy in terms of dialogue.

155
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,690
Scott: The dialogue was a little bit derpy in that first episode.

156
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,430
Rym: It does not get less derpy.

157
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:31,170
Rym: Now, couple this with the fact that if you did not know this was an American cartoon, like on American TV, and you listened to it, this is one of the things I always say about anime dubs.

158
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,610
Scott: You think it was an anime English dub?

159
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:43,079
Rym: Yeah, if you listen to any anime dub, except for perhaps the Disney ones and maybe Cowboy Bebop, not knowing it's anime, and I would just take a random person off the street and be like, "Listen to this audio.

160
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:44,227
Rym: What is this

161
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:44,509
Rym: from?".

162
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,570
Rym: And they'll know immediately if it's anime because anime dubs kind of suck.

163
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:58,330
Rym: But it's not the actor's fault because I know for a fact that a lot of these actors that are in some shit dubs are really good when they're doing something in English that was originally in English.

164
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,597
Rym: Yeah, or even voice acting.

165
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:04,270
Rym: I don't want to say not real acting, but not also face acting.

166
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,790
Rym: So I think it just comes down to a combination of bad script writing and bad direction that makes these anime dubs all bad.

167
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:21,870
Scott: I mean, if you look, the people who do the voices in Ponies have done a bunch of not as good voices in other things, but in Ponies, there's some damn fine voice acting going on there.

168
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,430
Rym: Oh, My Little Pony has some of the best voice acting I've seen in a long time from anything.

169
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:34,990
Rym: But yet, somehow, despite the fact that this Thundercats is Studio 4C and looks amazing, it sounds like a crappy 90s anime dub.

170
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:49,510
Rym: And it really takes away from the epicness of it because the characters just kind of say derpy, overdramatic things out of nowhere all the time with that kind of inflection that anime dubs always have.

171
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:55,250
Scott: My theory is that it has to do with doing it together, the different styles of doing it, right?

172
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,650
Scott: Everyone in the same room doing it before the animation is done.

173
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:04,530
Rym: Ah, but many good things in America are done in the not cool style of, you know, everyone in the room.

174
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,670
Rym: They're done it with everyone individually in their own private room.

175
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,166
Scott: But I do, I think that from what I heard, I'm not 100% sure.

176
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,570
Scott: I think the Ponies is done with everyone in the same room before they animate the mouths.

177
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,010
Rym: I am guessing it is because I'm pretty sure that Futurama was done that way as well.

178
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:27,150
Scott: I think Futurama was also done that way because if you look on the DVDs, you can actually, when they show the voice actors in the extras, yeah, they're always in the same room together.

179
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:31,790
Scott: And I think that that style has a significant impact.

180
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,410
Rym: The way to find out for sure, I gotta know if the Archer dubbing is done that way or not.

181
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,803
Rym: Because Archer is also some fantastic 100% grade A voice acting.

182
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,250
Scott: Yeah, I'm still not, I don't think the show is funny, but the voice acting is pretty good.

183
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:45,913
Rym: It's weird.

184
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:48,450
Rym: I usually understand where you're coming from.

185
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,223
Rym: I know why you don't like Firefly.

186
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,170
Rym: I can understand that.

187
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:56,210
Rym: I know why you don't like, you wouldn't want to own a dog, for example.

188
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,177
Rym: I know why you don't like Star Trek.

189
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,390
Rym: I cannot understand why you don't like Archer.

190
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:03,430
Rym: I don't get what you don't like about it.

191
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,150
Scott: It's not funny.

192
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:05,829
Rym: What's not funny about it?

193
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:06,949
Scott: What's funny about it?

194
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:18,090
Rym: The comedic timing of Archer and just all the other characters and the way they deliver, they're kind of realistic about as witty as real people are banter.

195
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:20,670
Scott: They're not as witty as real people.

196
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:24,430
Rym: I would say that they're wittier than the average person.

197
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,526
Rym: It's like Meowshwitz in there.

198
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,929
Rym: Whatever, Archer is the funniest show to come out on TV.

199
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:32,890
Scott: Okay.

200
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,290
Scott: Ever.

201
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:33,656
Scott: No.

202
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,190
Rym: But anyway, the Thundercats TV show, take it or leave it.

203
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:43,970
Rym: I might keep watching it because the animation is really good and the plot's okay.

204
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,290
Scott: And you got nothing else to watch.

205
00:10:45,691 --> 00:11:03,210
Rym: But I guess the problem is, the fundamental problem, I recently watched Madoka Magica and fresh in my mind is the memory of what it feels like to watch something that's fucking awesome grade A. So watching this, it's like, I got to watch the next episode, I guess.

206
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,188
Scott: Yeah, right.

207
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:12,930
Scott: So speaking of Madoka Magica, here's something that's barely news, but I just want to make a point about it real quick because the rest of this episode isn't going to go long.

208
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:21,710
Scott: In Japan, there was a grocery store called Lawson or some kind of convenience store or something, convenience store chain Lawson, and they had a Madoka promotion.

209
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:28,870
Scott: And the way the promotion works is you would get points by being a customer and you could use the points to get exclusive Madoka Magica items.

210
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:34,630
Scott: And one of the items was a poster and there was only 10 of them, period.

211
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,310
Scott: So it's good to get enough points for the poster and you get the points before anyone else.

212
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,110
Rym: That is a really good poster though.

213
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:41,657
Scott: So the poster is pretty good.

214
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:49,230
Scott: It's like a fancy 3D poster was assigned by the voice actresses and it's got the Madoka characters standing in front of Lawson wearing Lawson uniforms, I guess.

215
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:52,630
Scott: You know, it's like you're basically buying an advertisement for the whatever.

216
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,219
Scott: So I don't know.

217
00:11:54,010 --> 00:12:01,887
Scott: So this poster was sold on Japanese eBay, right?

218
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:03,090
Scott: Equivalent, basically.

219
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:03,237
Rym: Yeah.

220
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,777
Scott: For 501,000 yen, that's 6,600 American dollars.

221
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:12,687
Scott: Oh, Yahoo Japan auction site.

222
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:12,930
Scott: Okay.

223
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:13,736
Rym: Okay.

224
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:14,645
Rym: I mean...

225
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,996
Scott: Even as the best poster in the universe, and there's only one of them, and for getting God rubbed his dick on it, I'm not paying $6,600 for it.

226
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:25,656
Scott: I'd pay $6,600 for...

227
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,476
Rym: Scott, here's what I would do.

228
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:31,010
Rym: I would buy it for that much money.

229
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:35,928
Rym: I would then illegally make prints and sell them for $100 each.

230
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,370
Scott: The thing is, it's some kind of 3D poster with autographs is sort of the, right?

231
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,050
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is, a lot of people would probably be okay with the print.

232
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:49,110
Scott: I would pay $6,600 for a real arts, like Mona Lisa on the wall type of situation.

233
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,286
Scott: I'd pay a lot more than $6,600 for that, but you can see the point, right?

234
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,350
Scott: For a poster, I'm not paying.

235
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,850
Rym: So very briefly, things of the day.

236
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,970
Rym: We're talking about animation on these Wednesday nights most often.

237
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:14,010
Rym: We were just talking about an anime that has great animation and derpy voice acting, and another show that has great animation and great voice acting.

238
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:22,910
Rym: I submit to you a third example of great animation and also great voice acting, though they're cheating because it's an announcer narrating stuff.

239
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:34,989
Rym: We've talked about these off and on, but if you have not seen all of the Goofy's Guide to Some Sport from the 40s and 50s Disney, you should watch all of them.

240
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,300
Rym: So I picked a semi-random one.

241
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:43,430
Rym: I was going to show you Goofy Gymnastics, but Scott insisted that it be changed to Goofy the Olympic Champ.

242
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:49,190
Scott: No, I just said that Track and Field is my favorite one, and that I kept asking to watch it, and you kept watching different ones.

243
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,537
Scott: Because the other ones are better.

244
00:13:50,557 --> 00:13:58,710
Rym: The best ones are, in order, The Art of Skiing, Goofy Gymnastics, and the Boxing one.

245
00:13:59,035 --> 00:13:59,910
Scott: I like the Olympic one.

246
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:01,364
Rym: I do like the Olympic one.

247
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:01,810
Rym: It's okay.

248
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:13,769
Rym: I like how this era of Disney very often has the image of a stick of some kind that has burned down or a match or something, and it's that little black charred thing with the bulb at the top kind of bent over.

249
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,447
Rym: Like that particular icon is in so many Disney cartoons from that era.

250
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:19,070
Rym: It's kind of funny.

251
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:27,490
Rym: Now that I point that out, you'll see it everywhere, but this is Goofy showing you what it's like to be an Olympic champion in 1942.

252
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,429
Rym: A Goofy Olympic champion.

253
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:30,199
Scott: So check this out.

254
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:31,550
Scott: This is another, right?

255
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:33,302
Scott: You all know the Daikon animation.

256
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:34,310
Scott: If you don't, get out of here.

257
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,889
Scott: This is something that I saw a tweet about.

258
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:46,670
Scott: Basically, someone made a fan animation a long time ago combining Matt Cross, which is my favorite, with Minky Momo, which I don't know really that much about.

259
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,789
Scott: I just know it's a magical girl show.

260
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:52,450
Scott: So they combined Minky Momo and Matt Cross into this animation a zillion years ago.

261
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:55,464
Scott: And, you know, it's not the highest quality.

262
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:56,550
Scott: There's a lot of still frames.

263
00:14:56,691 --> 00:15:02,430
Scott: The voice acting is over non-moving mouths and whatever, but very impressive for people who did not have computers.

264
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,490
Scott: Incredibly impressive.

265
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,330
Scott: In fact, it's better than a lot of things people make now that they do have computers.

266
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:13,634
Scott: So if you are sitting around doing nothing and just playing WoW all day or whatever, shame!

267
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:18,669
Scott: And if you're out there making stuff, then here's some cool stuff.

268
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,330
Scott: That's cool and old and kind of interesting.

269
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:28,270
Rym: So before we get to the main bit, very briefly in the meta moment, if you want to see us at the New York Comic Con, tell us you're going.

270
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,669
Rym: We'll be there at various times doing press-related stuff.

271
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,549
Rym: MAGFest is coming up.

272
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:39,210
Rym: You should probably get a hotel room and register for MAGFest soon before it sells out.

273
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,509
Rym: It almost definitely is going to sell out.

274
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,010
Scott: Burning Apocalypse Con 1111?

275
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,637
Rym: Burning Apocalypse Con 1111 will probably also sell out.

276
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,100
Scott: Yep.

277
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:49,869
Rym: And that's pretty much it.

278
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,970
Rym: The worst webcomic contest is done because we're judging it right the fuck now.

279
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:54,609
Scott: That's right.

280
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,010
Rym: And the Book Club book, which we will do an episode on next Thursday.

281
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,670
Scott: The Ear, The Eye, The Arm.

282
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,169
Scott: But are we doing them not on Thursdays?

283
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:03,488
Rym: It's up to you.

284
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:05,250
Scott: I thought we already decided that.

285
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:05,630
Scott: Alright.

286
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,448
Rym: We will put it up at some point in the next week or two.

287
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,650
Rym: Our review of The Ear, The Eye, The Arm by Nancy Farmer.

288
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,568
Rym: And its sequel, The Throat.

289
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,077
Rym: No.

290
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,189
Rym: I was going to make a joke there.

291
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:18,110
Scott: The throat, the crotch, the foot.

292
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,110
Rym: Yeah, so here's my trouble.

293
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:24,830
Rym: For some reason, I could not come up with any other body parts except genitalia.

294
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,747
Rym: So I kind of paused there and gave up.

295
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,225
Scott: Yep.

296
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,325
Rym: Alright, so.

297
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,868
Scott: Worst webcomic contest.

298
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,870
Scott: Let's get this over with.

299
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,670
Rym: So we were talking just a moment ago about how you should get off your ass and create something.

300
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:37,129
Rym: So I want to make something very clear.

301
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:41,390
Rym: Every single entry that we're about to talk about.

302
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,149
Scott: Not every single, but most of the entries.

303
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:44,870
Scott: The majority.

304
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,090
Rym: The ones that aren't just GoDaddy squatting pages.

305
00:16:52,033 --> 00:17:01,089
Rym: Are the people who do them, if you are not creating something and they did this comic, no matter how horrible, they are on some level better than you.

306
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:01,830
Scott: That's right.

307
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,289
Rym: Because at least they made something.

308
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,970
Rym: And no matter how bad something is, I mean, you know what?

309
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,392
Rym: Go listen to GeekNights from 2005.

310
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:12,790
Rym: We would not have been winning the best contest, best podcast contest.

311
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,030
Scott: Go look at the first Penny Arcade.

312
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:15,470
Scott: Yeah.

313
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,328
Scott: Still funny though.

314
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,950
Rym: So we're going to go through a good number of the submissions here.

315
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,267
Scott: All of them.

316
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,430
Rym: Now, we had some very specific criteria for this contest.

317
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,359
Rym: We did.

318
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,650
Rym: You know, people had to submit the name of the comic and all that stuff.

319
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:34,610
Rym: But we have some objective aspects of worst-ness that we wanted people to check off.

320
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:37,390
Rym: So that we could kind of categorize these comics.

321
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,110
Rym: And I think this covers pretty much everything.

322
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:58,530
Rym: The categories were bad art, bad writing, racist, sexist, tries to be funny and fails, tries to be serious and fails, never gets better as time goes on, fap comic that tries to pretend it isn't, and the author is crazy independent of the comic itself.

323
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:00,129
Rym: That last one counts for a lot.

324
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,070
Scott: Well, we are going to judge these entirely subjectively.

325
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,205
Rym: Yep.

326
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,529
Rym: Scott and I just have to come to some sort of consensus.

327
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:11,229
Rym: I only have up the list of the comics, not who submitted them.

328
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:12,469
Rym: I have the full list.

329
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,370
Rym: Well, I'm not looking at the names of the people.

330
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,610
Rym: They're scrolled off to the right.

331
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,310
Scott: Well, we're just going to go in order of submission.

332
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:23,470
Scott: So the first one and actually the second one that were submitted were the exact same ones submitted by two different people.

333
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:29,670
Rym: Well, it's technically, there's two different comics there, but they're by the same person and they're basically the same.

334
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,610
Scott: Yeah, we're going to put, if it's on the same website, I count it as the same webcomic, right?

335
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,430
Scott: Like there was a last second entry that I didn't even really get enough time to look at.

336
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:38,359
Rym: I looked at it.

337
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,409
Rym: It's pretty bad.

338
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:45,710
Scott: Yeah, but, you know, it seemed to be a website with a whole bunch of comics done by the same, you know, the same crew of people.

339
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:49,530
Scott: And it's like, dudes, that, you know, that counts as one comic, right?

340
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,942
Scott: It's, you know, whatever.

341
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:51,610
Scott: Anyway.

342
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,830
Rym: So mama is and/or Hathor the cow goddess.

343
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:56,651
Scott: Yes.

344
00:18:56,892 --> 00:19:02,330
Scott: So this comic, basically the deal here is that some lady who, she is a geek of breastfeeding.

345
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:03,889
Scott: That is the thing she is into.

346
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,197
Rym: I do not think she is a geek.

347
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:06,790
Rym: She is a nerd of breastfeeding.

348
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:07,143
Rym: Indeed.

349
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:12,869
Rym: Because I do not, I think that breast, her knowledge and interest in breastfeeding is very deep.

350
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,030
Rym: But I do not detect many other interests.

351
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,610
Scott: Well, she, you know, you get an idea of like what this person, you know, believes.

352
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:27,070
Scott: And it's like, you know, obviously she believes in breastfeeding, but on the other hand, she takes it way too far.

353
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:29,769
Rym: And also, how can you take it too far?

354
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,689
Rym: I mean, breastfeeding like a boss on Deborah's desk.

355
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:40,730
Scott: No, you know, like militant breastfeeding, like everybody, you know, it's like if you're a vegetarian, you're just like, I don't eat meat versus you don't eat meat, die in hell.

356
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,210
Scott: No, I'll say, I mean, you do eat meat, die in hell.

357
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:48,430
Rym: I do agree with the sentiment that Barbara shouldn't be illegal and breastfeeding should be okay.

358
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,010
Rym: The only places breastfeeding should not be okay are the same places that eating is not okay.

359
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:53,652
Scott: That's right.

360
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:58,950
Scott: But the point, you know, this person, you know, they suggested that she was crazy, at least in her, in the submissions.

361
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,850
Scott: And it's like, well, she's partially crazy, right?

362
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,910
Rym: I think she's a little crazy.

363
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:02,233
Rym: Right.

364
00:20:02,253 --> 00:20:04,210
Scott: Like on the one hand, she's got some good ideas.

365
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:10,970
Scott: Like she's into free range kids and she's got, there was some comics there that depicted like a cage around the playground and she was like, no good.

366
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:11,976
Scott: You know?

367
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:13,269
Scott: And I was like, yeah, you tell them.

368
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:18,489
Scott: And then, but there were some other ones that were, I was like, uh, you, yeah.

369
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:25,170
Rym: I think part of what makes it odd is that, well here, I'll read the description that one of the people submitted.

370
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:32,070
Rym: Heather, the cow goddess features an ultra liberal cow headed, breasted as you can tell because every other comic features her breasts.

371
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,690
Rym: Woman who does nothing but espouse the benefits of breastfeeding.

372
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:35,190
Rym: That's true.

373
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:35,749
Rym: Home birth.

374
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:36,730
Rym: Home school.

375
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,909
Scott: Home birth is not a good idea.

376
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:38,809
Rym: Home schooling.

377
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,627
Scott: Not a good idea.

378
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,423
Rym: Unschooling.

379
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:40,886
Scott: Okay.

380
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,230
Rym: While mocking such absurd things as science, medical technology and actual structured education.

381
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:46,089
Scott: Uh, not good.

382
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:52,450
Scott: Now it's like one of those people who basically believes, you know, I guess the set of things, some of which are right and some of which are wrong.

383
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:53,410
Rym: Now that's fine.

384
00:20:53,630 --> 00:21:02,950
Scott: I'm not, I don't think that, I am personally not going to judge someone's comic based on how much I personally agree or disagree with their things.

385
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,510
Scott: I'm just going to, you know, but I am going to judge the person based on how crazy they are.

386
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,349
Scott: Someone could completely agree with me on everything and still be a nut.

387
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,750
Scott: Someone could also disagree with me on everything and be perfectly sane.

388
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:19,110
Rym: Well, for example, I was at the, uh, the Jon Stewart rally and there's this one guy and we're, you know, we're all talking and he's like, yeah.

389
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,530
Rym: He's making all these good points about, you know, the general liberal intelligent politics that we espouse.

390
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:26,409
Rym: And then he looks up and he's like, you see that?

391
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:27,810
Rym: That's a chem trail.

392
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,909
Rym: And I was like, okay, we're done here.

393
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:34,430
Rym: I was like, you believe, don't even talk to me.

394
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,567
Rym: And I just, I gave up on him.

395
00:21:36,434 --> 00:21:37,509
Rym: So I got to back up here.

396
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:41,850
Rym: I think that this comment got trolled almost down.

397
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,150
Rym: I feel like this woman probably had to put up with a lot of the internet hate machine.

398
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:46,921
Scott: Probably.

399
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:47,147
Scott: Yes.

400
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:53,690
Rym: Because I go back, uh, ultra liberal cowheaded, you know, breasted woman, literally cowheaded.

401
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,270
Rym: The art is just kind of a normal human mother with this sort of cow mask face.

402
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:58,891
Scott: Yeah.

403
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:00,810
Scott: The art is really not so great.

404
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,083
Rym: It's not that bad though.

405
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:02,610
Rym: It's kind of cute.

406
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,849
Scott: It's better than I can draw.

407
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,450
Rym: It's better than some web comics I have read for a long time.

408
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:07,972
Scott: It's true.

409
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:11,630
Scott: It doesn't improve that much over time, but it does improve slightly.

410
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,870
Scott: My main problem with it, when she's very bad with the speech bubbles and putting the words in the right place.

411
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:18,610
Scott: The lettering is just awful.

412
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,070
Rym: She obviously has like, oh, this is my idea.

413
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:24,050
Rym: And it just kind of, uh, shirotasms all over the page.

414
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:24,291
Scott: Yeah.

415
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:27,610
Scott: A lot of the comics actually have this problem of awful lettering, right?

416
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:36,210
Scott: It's like when you read, when you get a Marvel comic or a DC comic, they have, you know, penciler, writer, penciler, colorist, inker, and letterer.

417
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,770
Scott: And lettering is like the last thing a lot of web convicts care about.

418
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,970
Scott: Like some of them never even try to improve lettering, you know, if they're just concentrating on art.

419
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,249
Scott: They just sort of, you know, make a speech bubble and fill it in.

420
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:49,109
Scott: And it's like, yeah, it's a bad idea.

421
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,007
Scott: Penny Arcade on the other hand, excellent lettering.

422
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:55,730
Rym: So, I don't know, offhand, I'm just going to rate them on craziness.

423
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,157
Rym: This gets five.

424
00:22:57,257 --> 00:22:59,550
Rym: I'm not, I don't know what the scale is, but I'm going to set it at five.

425
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,439
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what the scale is, but I mean, this is definitely, you know, I'm not going to read this.

426
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,590
Scott: It's a bad web comic.

427
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:08,650
Scott: But I'm not going to make, this is not the worst web comic.

428
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:10,080
Rym: It's, you know, it's weird.

429
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:11,210
Rym: There's like this line.

430
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:13,230
Rym: Like there's this whole scale of web comics.

431
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,430
Rym: And then there's this line below with, below which is like the untouchables.

432
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,376
Rym: It's well above that.

433
00:23:18,436 --> 00:23:21,570
Rym: Like below that line is almost undifferentiated from white noise.

434
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,590
Scott: So yeah, so mama is slash cow classic cow goddess.

435
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:28,909
Scott: In fact, you know what, I'm going to say right now.

436
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,089
Scott: Submitted by Colby and also fat 101, you did not win.

437
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:36,510
Scott: No, because- But at the same time, winning is losing in this contest.

438
00:23:36,891 --> 00:23:41,610
Rym: Well, the thing is, this is great in that this is why it can't win.

439
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:48,470
Rym: It's weird enough to where anyone who is on the internet should find it and go, what?

440
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:55,130
Scott: Yeah, it's actually, it's not worth reading every day, obviously, but just go to it once so you know it exists and see what it's about.

441
00:23:56,031 --> 00:24:01,429
Rym: So we're not going to talk about every time it got submitted, but control delete was the next submission.

442
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:02,348
Scott: Gasp.

443
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,229
Scott: And the first person to submit it was no name, no email address.

444
00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:08,019
Rym: It got submitted a bunch more times.

445
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:12,510
Scott: So control all delete wins the award for- We're only going to discuss it once right now, but we'll count.

446
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,430
Scott: We're going to go down the list sequentially of order of submission.

447
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:20,390
Scott: So we'll mention every time there's another control delete submission and have a final tally at the end.

448
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,770
Rym: Control all delete wins the award for being control all delete.

449
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,029
Rym: I don't know what I can say.

450
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:28,930
Rym: I hadn't actually really read it until it got submitted in our contest.

451
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,310
Rym: Like I had always kind of ignored it.

452
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,509
Scott: I knew it existed, obviously, for a long time.

453
00:24:33,053 --> 00:24:40,950
Scott: And I, you know, I had seen the guy who made it at conventions, and I heard many stories about him of various vagueness and, you know, things.

454
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,890
Scott: And I knew that he was sort of crazy and weird actually reading his comic.

455
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:51,390
Scott: You know, for comics that were incredibly long, I just sort of read like the earliest comics, some random ones in the middle, and then the latest comics.

456
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:58,810
Scott: A, what was interesting about this is the art progressed, but it didn't progress that much considering the age of it.

457
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,153
Scott: Right?

458
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:05,830
Scott: It's like there was a significant improvement, but considering the time period, the improvement was not congruent with the time period.

459
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:07,850
Scott: It should have improved much, much more.

460
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,750
Rym: Like I hit a random comic here and it's from 2005.

461
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,861
Scott: Right.

462
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:19,070
Rym: And it looks kind of like Penny Arcade from a similar era.

463
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,870
Scott: Well, that's something else I was going to say, right?

464
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,690
Scott: Is that a lot of the jokes, like I picked a bunch of random comics in the middle.

465
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:32,450
Scott: Almost all of them appeared to be stealing or, you know, leaning on jokes from other things.

466
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,470
Scott: Like he was just retelling jokes that belonged to other people.

467
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,230
Scott: Now, maybe he invented those jokes and I read the retelling somewhere else.

468
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:39,890
Scott: It's definitely possible.

469
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,450
Scott: But for there to be so many of them, right?

470
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:51,210
Scott: It's like how come this, you know, either everyone is stealing this guy's jokes or this guy is stealing everyone's jokes, which is more likely, right?

471
00:25:52,314 --> 00:25:54,090
Scott: So it seemed like he wasn't even really writing it.

472
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:59,530
Scott: He was just finding the joke on the internet of the day and making a comic that says the same exact joke of what he found.

473
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,448
Rym: Well, it felt more like it was, I don't want to say it was stealing from Penny Arcade specifically, but it was...

474
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,450
Scott: There were some, I do remember one or two instances of Penny Arcade stealing specifically.

475
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:12,250
Rym: It was just a lot of the same kind of humor, but done in four frames instead of three.

476
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:17,689
Rym: Which, that's, you know, we have some old comics we could talk about, but they weren't submitted, so we won't.

477
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:26,270
Rym: Where we had a, basically the comic would be hilarious and then one of the co-creators would always add like one extra panel that ruined it.

478
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:30,983
Scott: Yeah, so what else about control, delete?

479
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:32,390
Scott: It's not actually funny.

480
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:40,190
Rym: Oh my god, I've clicked on three random ones in a row and they're lit like the exact same joke as a Penny Arcade from a similar time.

481
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:40,886
Rym: That's what I was saying.

482
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:43,610
Rym: I know, but I'm just literally like clicking random here.

483
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:44,827
Rym: I know, that's what I did too.

484
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:45,324
Scott: I know.

485
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:53,130
Rym: I don't, I can't, I don't want to say control, delete didn't win yet because the comic itself is not that bad.

486
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,889
Rym: It's just kind of really mediocre and just goes on for a long time.

487
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,529
Rym: But the author is kind of crazy.

488
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,089
Scott: Well, I mean, if you believe the stories about the guy.

489
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,650
Rym: There's too many of them for me to discount all of them from so many different sources.

490
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,213
Scott: No, I don't discount them.

491
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:11,450
Scott: I know he's crazy, but I, you know, I'm trying to judge the comics.

492
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:17,210
Scott: I mean, I am taking craziness into account, no doubt, but I am trying to judge the comics more than the craziness.

493
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:26,130
Rym: Yeah, but if you, you know, you multiply comic badness by say 10 and craziness by 0.05, still a closely run affair.

494
00:27:26,631 --> 00:27:27,013
Scott: I don't know.

495
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:30,050
Scott: I think he's pretty much equally crazy to the cow goddess lady.

496
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:35,270
Rym: Yeah, the thing is the cow goddess lady feels a lot more benign.

497
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:36,369
Scott: That's true.

498
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:42,250
Rym: Like, like I feel like if you criticized her, her response would be, I do what I do for the people who like it.

499
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:45,209
Rym: And I feel like Tim Buckley would spittle on me.

500
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,870
Scott: Yeah, he definitely seems like there's a lot of drama going on.

501
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,529
Rym: Maybe he's an Andy Kaufman, but I don't know.

502
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,550
Rym: There's just, especially because I talked to a lot of people who know him more directly.

503
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,590
Scott: If he was an Andy Kaufman, then he should win best upcoming.

504
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,210
Rym: Yes, absolutely.

505
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:08,510
Rym: The thing is, people talk about that plot twist that I actually didn't read that part and didn't find it randomly and didn't bother to take the time to find it.

506
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:21,530
Scott: Yeah, that is something is if you, you know, people who submitted comics that were very long, just due to the nature of them and the nature of this contest, I could judge all the parts of the comic with my method of beginning, middle, end, but I couldn't judge the long term plot.

507
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,169
Scott: That's just impossible for me to look at.

508
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:34,610
Scott: So if, you know, I know Control Delete does have sort of this long term plot, but I couldn't really bring that into account in my subjective decision making because I had no way to experience it properly.

509
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:37,769
Scott: Even I could read a summary of Cliff's notes of it, but that doesn't do anything for you.

510
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:44,430
Scott: But I did notice that pretty much the newest comics and the oldest comics, it doesn't seem like there's been a lot of progression.

511
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:51,790
Scott: It seems like it's, you know, you could read the first few comics to introduce you to the characters and then start reading the new ones and skip the whole middle and you wouldn't be too lost.

512
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:58,490
Rym: It's just like, the Cowyotus one, if I say, hey, check this out, people will go, whoa, and remember it.

513
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,790
Rym: If I tell someone random just to read Control Delete, they'll probably just kind of stop reading it and forget about it.

514
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:04,792
Scott: Yeah, I think so.

515
00:29:05,052 --> 00:29:16,970
Scott: So maybe if you've never read web comics before and you come across this, you know, you haven't heard these jokes before elsewhere, then it might work on you if you're, you know, because a lot of people like a lot of crap.

516
00:29:17,552 --> 00:29:22,649
Rym: But seriously, dude who submitted it, you did not need to check fap comic that tries to pretend it isn't.

517
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:26,465
Scott: Okay, next choice.

518
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:27,657
Rym: I actually... Oh, this one wins.

519
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:28,365
Rym: Fuck this comic.

520
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:28,770
Rym: It's terrible.

521
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:33,470
Scott: I read this entire comic as it was coming out right up to the end.

522
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,690
Rym: And even from the beginning at RIT, Scott and I barely fucking knew each other.

523
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:44,070
Rym: And he's like, you know, we're really getting into web comics because that's when they were like really exploding with Mega Tokyo and then Penny Arcade and everything.

524
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:48,883
Rym: And Scott's the only one in the crew who liked Bob and George.

525
00:29:48,924 --> 00:29:50,230
Rym: I guess Greg liked it too.

526
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:50,815
Scott: I don't know.

527
00:29:51,078 --> 00:29:51,909
Scott: I liked Bob and George.

528
00:29:52,611 --> 00:29:54,420
Rym: And to this day, none of us can understand why.

529
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,550
Rym: I just didn't... It wasn't funny.

530
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,197
Scott: So here's the deal with this comic.

531
00:29:58,217 --> 00:30:00,770
Scott: This guy originally wanted to draw web comics.

532
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,650
Scott: He started out drawing a web comic about Bob and George.

533
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,810
Scott: And he had the worst arts in the universe because he was just starting.

534
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:12,970
Scott: But he was so bad, his room for improvement, if he would have kept it up for a long time, would have been vast.

535
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:13,876
Scott: Right?

536
00:30:14,158 --> 00:30:16,030
Scott: He started with like barely stick figures.

537
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,131
Rym: Wow.

538
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:17,430
Rym: That's my new favorite insult.

539
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,630
Rym: Given time, your capability for improvement is vast.

540
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,429
Scott: That's right.

541
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,570
Scott: But he quickly gave up on that and went into sprite comic territory.

542
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:32,048
Scott: And he was pretty much the first and premiere sprite comic to go into the Mega Man zone.

543
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:32,590
Scott: Right?

544
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,650
Scott: You know, 8-Bit Theater is pretty much the only good sprite comic, I'm guessing.

545
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,589
Rym: I'll stand by that.

546
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,172
Rym: Yeah.

547
00:30:38,313 --> 00:30:38,999
Scott: But, you know...

548
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:46,679
Rym: Well, 8-Bit Theater, it amazes me how well he integrated those little sprites into personalities that to this day... As strong as ponies.

549
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,820
Rym: I see a black mage and that character is... There is no way to dissociate that character.

550
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:53,842
Scott: Exactly.

551
00:30:53,862 --> 00:30:57,980
Scott: So, yeah, so Bob and George, you know, he did it with Mega Man.

552
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,633
Scott: And he started by progressing through the Mega Man games.

553
00:31:00,854 --> 00:31:02,020
Scott: One, two, three, right?

554
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:04,608
Scott: And he had some funny jokes in there.

555
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,460
Scott: My favorite of which, which I still remember, is Flash Man.

556
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:09,532
Scott: And he's like, "Flash Man, what do you

557
00:31:09,592 --> 00:31:09,693
Scott: do?".

558
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:10,015
Scott: And he's like,

559
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:10,176
Scott: "No!"

560
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:14,200
Scott: Because he's going to flash him with, like, you know, a trench coat.

561
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,409
Rym: So, I don't know.

562
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,000
Rym: I never found any of the jokes funny.

563
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,905
Scott: I thought that was funny.

564
00:31:19,328 --> 00:31:21,180
Scott: Anyway, I like Mega Man a lot.

565
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,200
Rym: It was just... Yeah, but that's just not a good webcomic make.

566
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:26,900
Scott: It's better than the other previous two.

567
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,280
Rym: Name another funny one other than the Flash Man one.

568
00:31:29,983 --> 00:31:33,360
Scott: There were ones that were funny because I kept reading it and I laughed occasionally.

569
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:36,799
Scott: But I can't remember what they were because it was a zillion years ago.

570
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,978
Scott: The thing is, after he sort of finishes up with the Mega Man games...

571
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,719
Rym: Okay, this one's okay kind of funny.

572
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,001
Scott: Okay.

573
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:48,540
Scott: He goes on sort of a crazy plot, like, involving Bob and George and all these other characters.

574
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,389
Scott: And it's sort of incomprehensible.

575
00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:52,500
Scott: and there's some, like, self-insertion and time travel.

576
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,579
Rym: Ah, the problem with many webcomics.

577
00:31:55,302 --> 00:31:57,720
Rym: Many of which were not entered, so I will not talk about them.

578
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:57,900
Rym: Right.

579
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,159
Rym: Where you have a funny comic and then you try to get all plotty.

580
00:32:02,762 --> 00:32:10,860
Rym: And instead of making a new comic for that plot with characters for that plot, you just keep making the same fucking comic forever and try to mash all your plots onto it.

581
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,382
Rym: Right.

582
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:14,500
Scott: But eventually, he did end the comic at some point.

583
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:15,718
Scott: It did end.

584
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,249
Scott: It did end.

585
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:23,740
Scott: And he sort of weirdly brought the original fact that he was, you know, the true origin was.

586
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,520
Scott: he was trying to draw and he failed and switched to sprites, but he managed to tie that back in somehow.

587
00:32:29,402 --> 00:32:30,668
Scott: It's relatively incomprehensible.

588
00:32:30,688 --> 00:32:32,638
Scott: I wouldn't actually suggest anyone read it.

589
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:36,093
Scott: But, you know, it's not the worst.

590
00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:37,160
Scott: It's far from the worst.

591
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,606
Scott: It's better than Control Delete.

592
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:41,320
Scott: It's better than any of the ones so far.

593
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,240
Scott: So far it's the least bad of our three comics that we've gone over.

594
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,740
Rym: Yeah, but I must say, and I cannot stress this enough, it has never made me actually laugh.

595
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:55,379
Rym: I read a whole bunch of it a long time ago because Scott just wouldn't fucking shut up about it.

596
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,492
Scott: I don't remember not shutting up about it.

597
00:32:58,533 --> 00:32:59,520
Scott: I just remember you saying it.

598
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,308
Rym: Because you'd always be like, "Hey, Rym.

599
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:02,373
Rym: Flashman.".

600
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,215
Rym: And I'd be like, "I'm not gonna read Bob and

601
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:05,559
Rym: George.".

602
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:07,190
Rym: And you're like, "You gotta read Bob and George.

603
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:07,311
Rym: It's

604
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:07,573
Rym: great.".

605
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,580
Rym: In fact, we've had this same conversation many times for the past decade.

606
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:13,429
Rym: "I don't like Bob and

607
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:13,833
Rym: George.".

608
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,626
Scott: It's not the worst.

609
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:23,149
Scott: You know, there's ten billion webcomics out there just as good as it, with the same Mary Sue kind of sprite fan of something stuff.

610
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,619
Scott: And this one actually has a little bit of funniness to it, which puts it above those.

611
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:34,560
Scott: I'm not saying it's Penny Arcade or anything.

612
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,940
Rym: Alright, so someone submitted a comic that I'd never heard of called The Freckled Finger.

613
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,219
Scott: Right, so I took a look at this one.

614
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,080
Rym: I want to read the submission.

615
00:33:47,103 --> 00:33:49,159
Rym: The artist clearly puts a lot of work into this comic.

616
00:33:49,621 --> 00:33:54,560
Rym: What sort of makes the fact that it is unbelievably offensive even worse.

617
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,980
Rym: The guy is clearly trolling.

618
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:04,059
Rym: However, the racism, sexism, and general horribleness does not at all feel like the sort of parody racism that people trying to be edgy, et cetera, et cetera.

619
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,120
Rym: It wasn't as offensive as I expected it to be.

620
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,360
Rym: But then again, I've seen some pretty offensive things in my time.

621
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:14,219
Scott: Yeah, I mean, some of these comics, right?

622
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,438
Scott: First of all, the art's actually kind of good.

623
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,260
Scott: This didn't have awful art like all the other ones.

624
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,996
Rym: Some of them are funny in the same way that some of the parking lot is full.

625
00:34:24,036 --> 00:34:24,780
Rym: comics were funny.

626
00:34:25,284 --> 00:34:25,580
Scott: Exactly.

627
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:29,219
Rym: They weren't all that offensive.

628
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:34,359
Scott: For example, there was one that's like, "How does a sadomasochist propose to a

629
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:34,639
Scott: cutter?".

630
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:40,440
Scott: And it's like, you see this guy with all these tattoos proposing to some girl, and then he takes a razor blade and cuts her finger.

631
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,975
Scott: It's like, "Okay, I'm not laughing out loud at

632
00:34:43,034 --> 00:34:43,197
Scott: that.".

633
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,208
Scott: But it's like, you know, this guy's trying.

634
00:34:46,228 --> 00:34:49,540
Scott: He comes up with an original sort of clever idea each time.

635
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:53,139
Scott: And it's like, you can see what he was going for even if it didn't work out.

636
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,306
Scott: It's like he's trying.

637
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,094
Scott: He's got some sort of spark.

638
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,180
Scott: He just doesn't have any fire.

639
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,998
Rym: Yeah, well, the other thing is I feel like he too often did fall back on, "I'll just do something really

640
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:02,540
Rym: offensive."

641
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:03,159
Rym: Exactly.

642
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,380
Rym: And that's where edgy comedy fails when you do it.

643
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:09,520
Rym: It is just offensive, but there's no cleverness.

644
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:16,020
Rym: For example, the NSMB is offensive, but it's just clever enough to where you can laugh at it.

645
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,381
Scott: Right.

646
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:23,420
Scott: So look at, for example, Penny Arcade or South Park are offensive, but they're not primarily trying to be offensive.

647
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Scott: The offensiveness is the side effect of the original joke that they are telling.

648
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:33,380
Scott: It's just they don't hold back, so they end up being offensive with a dick wolf or some such.

649
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,380
Scott: Whereas if you aim for offensiveness first, then you have no joke.

650
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:42,299
Scott: You're just being extreme and out there with nothing to go by.

651
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:44,640
Scott: You know.

652
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,812
Scott: But yeah, the art on this is actually pretty good.

653
00:35:47,832 --> 00:35:49,120
Scott: He has a bunch of different styles.

654
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,180
Scott: He does a Calvin and Hobbes one at one point.

655
00:35:51,462 --> 00:35:52,491
Rym: I was looking at that one right now.

656
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:53,540
Rym: It's actually kind of funny.

657
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,221
Scott: Right.

658
00:35:54,803 --> 00:36:06,780
Scott: You know, so this is actually, I don't know if I'd read this just because it's not funny, but this is actually well above average in the webcomics world if you take every webcomic that ever existed into an account.

659
00:36:07,128 --> 00:36:07,340
Rym: Yeah.

660
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:12,639
Scott: The person who submitted this named Derek, I guess, just really didn't like it or was really offended by it.

661
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,096
Rym: Yeah, I mean, it is offensive.

662
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:15,580
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

663
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,759
Scott: Well, he says while he's in the submission, he said the guy was trolling.

664
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,660
Rym: No, I don't take that as an excuse.

665
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,720
Scott: I don't think he's trolling.

666
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:22,100
Rym: I think he's just trying to be funny.

667
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,960
Scott: He's just trying to be funny by being offensive.

668
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,480
Rym: But seriously, if you want an offensive webcomic, you should read The Parking Lot Is Full.

669
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:28,259
Scott: That's right.

670
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:32,980
Rym: And/or The Thin H Line, which was renamed Sexy Losers later.

671
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,047
Scott: Say A Freckled Finger?

672
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,519
Scott: Not the worst webcomic.

673
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,068
Rym: Sarah Zero.

674
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:38,335
Rym: I didn't read this one.

675
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:39,320
Rym: I must have missed it by accident.

676
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:47,500
Scott: So Sarah Zero is less of a webcomic and more of like an illustrated sort of action sci-fi thing, right?

677
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,180
Scott: And it's like each comic, it's got this fancy kind of website that's also sort of hard to navigate.

678
00:36:52,623 --> 00:36:52,948
Rym: Oh, yeah.

679
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:53,700
Rym: I'm going through it now.

680
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,081
Scott: Yeah.

681
00:36:54,101 --> 00:36:55,856
Scott: The lettering is actually great.

682
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,340
Scott: It's like, you know, I was just complaining about lettering on the other comic.

683
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,180
Scott: The lettering on this is like most of what it has going for it.

684
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:11,280
Scott: Like if you go to like a few comics back from the newest one, like someone's like whacking someone on the side of the head and then it's like snowplow.

685
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,660
Scott: It's like there's a bullet in the word snowplow is behind it with all the blood coming out of the person's head.

686
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,940
Scott: You know, I mean, it's you know, it's an action sci-fi kind of thing.

687
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,899
Scott: There's a whole bunch of comics.

688
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:27,840
Scott: Here's one where there's a car that's pretty well rendered driving down the road with an explosion behind it.

689
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,259
Scott: And on the front of the car is a plow.

690
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,000
Scott: And on the plow in reverse, it says slow traffic, keep right.

691
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,500
Scott: It's like, ah, you know, it's fairly incomprehensible.

692
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,400
Scott: But yeah, that's that's the problem with it is that you cannot even if you start at the beginning and read it one at a time.

693
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:48,220
Scott: You know, it's more of a well-lettered illustrated thing than a comic, I guess.

694
00:37:48,522 --> 00:37:50,839
Scott: But it's you can't figure out what's going on at all.

695
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,360
Scott: It's like who are these characters?

696
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,019
Rym: The person is trying to do something neat.

697
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:55,959
Scott: Yeah.

698
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,885
Rym: I don't really.

699
00:37:58,905 --> 00:38:02,620
Rym: I can't say it's bad because it's far from bad.

700
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,698
Rym: I again wouldn't read it because I can't tell what's going on.

701
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:07,805
Scott: Yeah, you can't you.

702
00:38:07,906 --> 00:38:09,280
Scott: it's like you can't care about it.

703
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:09,580
Scott: It's just.

704
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:16,920
Scott: you can look at a single strip or panel and just be like, oh, that's I see what you did there with that lettering around the shape of the person's face.

705
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:22,580
Scott: It's like, oh, but there's no reason to read it because you can't tell what the fuck is going on.

706
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:25,579
Rym: But then again, there was no reason to retry gun for the same reason.

707
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:26,399
Scott: That's correct.

708
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,420
Scott: Yeah.

709
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:34,720
Scott: So actually, I'd say this is about equal to Try Gun manga, which is not which is very far away from the worst web comic ever.

710
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:39,180
Scott: But still, Try Gun manga is not good.

711
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,656
Scott: Don't read it.

712
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:41,600
Rym: OK, so here's where we get on the rabbit.

713
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,225
Rym: Oh, God.

714
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:43,900
Rym: It updated.

715
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,187
Rym: There's there's.

716
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,459
Rym: there's some furry sex.

717
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,360
Scott: Kitten K. Voodle.

718
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,680
Rym: So I heard of Kitten K. Voodle many times.

719
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:51,608
Scott: You know, how do you know?

720
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:52,979
Scott: we met the guy who makes this right?

721
00:38:54,184 --> 00:38:54,454
Rym: Did we?

722
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:55,180
Scott: At Connecticut.

723
00:38:55,982 --> 00:38:56,537
Scott: Oh, shit.

724
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,280
Scott: We were at Connecticut and sitting there in it was an early Connecticut.

725
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:04,160
Scott: The first or second one we were at, we were sitting around talking.

726
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,597
Scott: This guy with this fat, smelly guy who had bad B.O.

727
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,499
Scott: wanted to show us his arts.

728
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,199
Scott: And it was this comic.

729
00:39:10,722 --> 00:39:13,100
Scott: And then when I saw this comic, I was like, oh, I've seen this before.

730
00:39:13,221 --> 00:39:16,480
Scott: It's that guy who showed me all this furry porn that he draws at Connecticut.

731
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:19,567
Rym: Yeah.

732
00:39:19,587 --> 00:39:21,840
Rym: You don't have to shoot it at me in reference to semen from.

733
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,590
Rym: Oh, wow.

734
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:22,896
Rym: Yeah.

735
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:24,598
Scott: Pretty much it.

736
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,000
Rym: I want to read the submission here because it does literally explain exactly what we're talking about.

737
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,724
Scott: All right.

738
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,799
Rym: This comic is famous among furries.

739
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:37,080
Rym: So there's these two furry characters, Kit and K. Voodle, married couple.

740
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:42,580
Rym: They moved to a town called Yiffberg, which indicates strongly which direction this is going.

741
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:52,790
Rym: They find they have a massive crop of Boink Berries, a berry that keeps one's Nice.

742
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:53,559
Scott: Let's move there.

743
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
Scott: They decide only people are allowed, no animals.

744
00:39:56,441 --> 00:39:56,747
Rym: I don't know.

745
00:39:56,767 --> 00:39:57,339
Rym: Cat girls are cool.

746
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,369
Rym: Maybe a fox girl.

747
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:58,999
Rym: I could live with that.

748
00:39:59,400 --> 00:39:59,800
Scott: It's all you.

749
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,620
Rym: There is nothing wrong with anthropomorphic art or any of that stuff.

750
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,839
Rym: When I say furry, I'm going to say this right now.

751
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:11,700
Rym: I mean, people on the Internet who like anthropomorphic art and have a persecution complex.

752
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:11,881
Scott: Yeah.

753
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:14,339
Scott: I mean, Goofy was anthropomorphic art, but that was a thing of the day.

754
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:14,822
Rym: Yeah.

755
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:18,274
Rym: It's just if if you have a chip on your shoulder about Is Goofy a furry?

756
00:40:18,355 --> 00:40:18,538
Scott: No.

757
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,997
Scott: Is Mickey Mouse furry?

758
00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:20,119
Scott: No.

759
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:22,071
Rym: It requires the chip on the shoulder.

760
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:23,480
Rym: It has to be the biggest chip ever.

761
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,628
Scott: Is Bugs Bunny furry?

762
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:26,080
Rym: Well, anyway.

763
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:26,994
Scott: Roger Rabbit?

764
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:27,260
Scott: Furry?

765
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:35,520
Rym: So, yeah, it's just them having sex and this weird like government, I guess, trying to stop people from having sex.

766
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,260
Rym: To quote the last sentence in the review, it's just like the most bizarre author track you've ever read.

767
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,140
Rym: Like a Jack Chick track for furry comics.

768
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:52,700
Scott: Now, you know, for example, in the earliest part of the comic, it's that, you know, Kit and Kay Boodle get stuck in a hole in the ground, literally like a rabbit hole.

769
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,059
Scott: They can't get out and, you know, they do it.

770
00:40:55,341 --> 00:41:02,240
Scott: And then their explosion from doing it causes them to be shot out of the hole, or at least it causes Kay to be shot out of the hole.

771
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,220
Scott: And I guess she saves Kit with a rope or whatever later.

772
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:12,280
Scott: But, you know, basically the art on this actually is not bad, except for the fact that it's drawing what is drawings of.

773
00:41:13,702 --> 00:41:15,567
Rym: Oh, yeah, there we go.

774
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:19,699
Rym: I've been going backtracking and I finally found one that did not have semen in it.

775
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,480
Scott: There you go.

776
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:24,920
Scott: But, yeah, you know, the art is actually good at arts, kind of.

777
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:31,540
Scott: You know, it's pretty typical, like newspaper quality, you know, anthropomorphic arts.

778
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:37,620
Scott: It just happens to be art of animal people having sex and doing all sorts of nasty shit.

779
00:41:38,282 --> 00:41:39,765
Scott: Other than that, it's good arts.

780
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:45,200
Scott: If he drew a non-furry comic, it probably would be pretty well done if someone else wrote it.

781
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:51,540
Rym: Actually, I would argue that his earlier, sketchier art looks better than the later color art.

782
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,086
Scott: Well, yeah, he definitely has a different style.

783
00:41:53,106 --> 00:41:55,838
Scott: It's not really a matter of, you know, I don't know.

784
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,231
Scott: But the guy can draw, regardless.

785
00:41:58,473 --> 00:41:59,680
Scott: A lot better than most people.

786
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,860
Rym: But it's not, for what it is, it's not a bad comic.

787
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,259
Rym: Because remember the category I said very specifically was "fap comic that tries to pretend it

788
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:08,540
Rym: isn't.".

789
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,540
Rym: This is a fap comic that does not make any bones about the fact that it's not bony.

790
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,303
Rym: That's exactly right.

791
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:16,620
Scott: Like, even though it's furry and it's not my thing and it's not most people's thing, right?

792
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:19,760
Scott: He's not even, like, trying to be shy about it.

793
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,814
Scott: This guy is just like, "Fucking animals, fucking hell, yeah.

794
00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:24,878
Scott: This turns me on.

795
00:42:24,938 --> 00:42:25,058
Scott: It's

796
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:25,540
Scott: awesome.".

797
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:27,698
Scott: And I'm like, "More power to you,

798
00:42:27,718 --> 00:42:27,960
Scott: man.".

799
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,240
Rym: You know, it's almost as though he's not a furry because you have to have that chip on your shoulder or you don't count.

800
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,484
Scott: Yeah, this guy has no chip.

801
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:36,531
Scott: He's just like, "Animals with dicks?

802
00:42:36,712 --> 00:42:38,097
Scott: Fucking, let's get it on.

803
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:38,638
Scott: Semen

804
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:39,080
Scott: everywhere.".

805
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,780
Rym: Granted, the comic itself has some of that persecution plot in it.

806
00:42:43,122 --> 00:42:43,518
Scott: That's true.

807
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,020
Rym: And I don't know if that bleeds over into his real life.

808
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:53,594
Scott: But it's like, you know, like, in the very first comic, like, he just sex all over the place and he's like, "Here's what you're in for.

809
00:42:54,757 --> 00:42:55,198
Scott: Just so you

810
00:42:55,238 --> 00:42:55,418
Scott: know.".

811
00:42:56,401 --> 00:42:58,660
Rym: So this is definitely not the worst webcomic.

812
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,229
Scott: And while the guy, when I met him, was, you know, had bad B.O.

813
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:08,020
Scott: and was fat, he wasn't actually, like, you know, offensive personality-wise.

814
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:09,732
Scott: Except for the fact that he's like, "Hey, check out my furry

815
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:09,934
Scott: porn.".

816
00:43:11,504 --> 00:43:11,850
Rym: You know what?

817
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:14,537
Scott: I'd rather hang out with- But at least he wasn't ashamed of, like, "Here, check out my furry

818
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:14,819
Scott: porn.".

819
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,584
Rym: I'm much happier hanging out with Mr.

820
00:43:16,604 --> 00:43:22,419
Rym: "Hey, look at my furry porn" than "Hey, check out my disembowelment hentai guy at

821
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:22,760
Rym: RIT.".

822
00:43:23,483 --> 00:43:25,432
Scott: So, Kitten K. Poodle, I'm not reading it.

823
00:43:25,613 --> 00:43:27,060
Scott: If you're not a furry, you shouldn't read it.

824
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,659
Scott: But actually, if you're a furry, this is probably the best webcomic in the world for you.

825
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,486
Scott: Right?

826
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,219
Scott: I mean, come on.

827
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:41,920
Rym: So, The Watch, which I already knew about because it's kind of famous for being a poster child of Mary Sues.

828
00:43:42,644 --> 00:43:43,098
Scott: Is it now?

829
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:43,405
Rym: Yeah.

830
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:48,780
Rym: I can't- There's a whole TV Tropes page, I don't know if it's still there, on this comic.

831
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:51,300
Rym: In fact, I believe they have a syndrome like The Watch Syndrome.

832
00:43:52,562 --> 00:43:59,560
Rym: It's kind of got a- I don't know, it's a- This is the archetypical fap comic that tries to pretend it isn't.

833
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,160
Scott: Is The Watch really that- I never heard of it before, ever.

834
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:04,900
Rym: It's famous among people who care about drama on the internet.

835
00:44:05,282 --> 00:44:05,600
Scott: Oh, okay.

836
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,165
Rym: I'll find the TV Tropes page.

837
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:09,113
Rym: You can start talking about your reviews.

838
00:44:09,154 --> 00:44:10,600
Rym: I knew a little bit more about it than you did.

839
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:19,820
Scott: Well, I mean, first of all, the art starts out as, like, you know- The first comics look basically about the same as the first Penny arcades, maybe a little bit worse.

840
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:23,300
Scott: The newest ones look only slightly better.

841
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,040
Scott: Like, the level of improvement was not much at all, really.

842
00:44:29,004 --> 00:44:30,580
Scott: You could have improved a lot more there.

843
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:39,420
Scott: The other thing is that it's like, I read the first few strips, and it's like, how the hell does this get to be where it is in the newest ones?

844
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:45,820
Scott: It's like, I had to do a whole lot of reading to figure out what the hell's going on here, and I am not doing that at all.

845
00:44:47,802 --> 00:44:49,599
Rym: Apparently there are spin-offs of The Watch.

846
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,922
Rym: So, here's the deal.

847
00:44:52,543 --> 00:45:02,860
Rym: One, it's basically a comic for people who have certain oddly specific fetishes and want something to titillate them.

848
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,663
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

849
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:07,540
Rym: Based on the way people talk about it, and the content.

850
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:13,640
Scott: But it's like, from the- I looked at a bunch of strips, and I couldn't find anything that was, you know, fat fish or weird like that.

851
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:20,900
Rym: Well, 'cause it's not- you realize there's a whole community of people on the internet who are really into this sort of gender transformation-y stuff.

852
00:45:22,424 --> 00:45:23,379
Scott: I did see some of that.

853
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,928
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of that.

854
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,740
Rym: Maybe we read different parts of this comic.

855
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,361
Rym: Maybe.

856
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:32,052
Scott: But it's like, it mostly just looked like, you know, pretty average webcomic.

857
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:36,419
Scott: Like, okay, there's like a magical girl, and there's some, you know- But think about the plot.

858
00:45:36,461 --> 00:45:37,100
Scott: She's in high school.

859
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:47,520
Rym: Basically, the main character girl is basically better than everyone else, more powerful than everyone else, fixes everything no matter what, everyone else is kind of pointless.

860
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,638
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's not like it's, you know- It reeks of Mary Sue.

861
00:45:52,060 --> 00:46:01,220
Scott: Yeah, it's not well plotted or structured or anything like that, but it's just, it's not like painfully awful, like oh god, this is the worst thing I've ever read.

862
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,119
Rym: Well here, I'll read the description again from submission.

863
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:15,160
Scott: Is that a lot of people coming to these comics, right, is they brought in like the community or the meta around the comics, you know, and they, because they know about the comics.

864
00:46:15,262 --> 00:46:16,080
Rym: Ah, true, for example.

865
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,400
Scott: That's why they submit them, but me, I'm coming to this, never even heard of this before.

866
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,080
Rym: So here's a good example.

867
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,059
Scott: So I don't get any of that.

868
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:24,200
Rym: Say, you know, there is pornography of Pokemon out there.

869
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,620
Rym: It's true.

870
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,100
Rym: But you can't say that that makes Pokemon bad.

871
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:29,260
Rym: Right, it's like- That people are turned on by Pikachu.

872
00:46:29,601 --> 00:46:36,800
Scott: Exactly, it's like if you, you know, there's a world of Pokemon stuff, so if you ask me about Pokemon, there's a whole bunch of stuff that comes to mind, like the third movie for instance.

873
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:51,840
Scott: But if you just give someone the first Pokemon game and play that and that's all they know of Pokemon is what's in that, actually in that game, their judgment is going to be completely different from say someone who reads the forums of the watch or knows the history of the watch or the person who writes and draws the watch.

874
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:58,859
Rym: Yeah, for example, I for a long time read a comic called College Roomies from Hell and it's one of these kind of general mediocre- Talk about art doesn't improve.

875
00:46:59,145 --> 00:46:59,900
Rym: It actually does.

876
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,319
Rym: It looks way better than it used to.

877
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:01,939
Scott: Barely.

878
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:02,799
Rym: Yeah, a lot better.

879
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,439
Scott: Maybe about the same as the watch.

880
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:13,240
Rym: Anyway, the submission I present to you, quote, I present to thee the watch, a comic with so much potential that it's squandering of its legacy.

881
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:17,480
Scott: I present to thee a comic- Squandering, that it's squandering of it is legendary.

882
00:47:17,782 --> 00:47:18,016
Rym: Oh yeah.

883
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:28,780
Rym: I present to thee a comic that barely improved its art despite existing for as long as it has, despite the artist working alongside someone whose art is identical to her only with actual effort.

884
00:47:29,341 --> 00:47:36,700
Rym: A comic that has much body horror, an explanation of what body horror is, horrifying, fascinating.

885
00:47:37,764 --> 00:47:39,340
Rym: No, it's fat material.

886
00:47:40,546 --> 00:47:41,559
Rym: At least according to the submitter.

887
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,100
Scott: Yeah, in what I read I couldn't find any fat material.

888
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:51,500
Rym: Maybe it's because I read the descriptions of every submission before I actually read the comics.

889
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,680
Rym: So, you know, the submission talks a lot about why it's fat material for this stuff.

890
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,720
Rym: So I found a lot of stuff on the internet about body horror fetishism.

891
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:08,480
Rym: People who like the idea of being turned to stone, like they'll probably watch My Little Pony when the cockatrice gets fluttershy and ah shit son.

892
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:09,453
Scott: Uh huh.

893
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:09,849
Rym: Yeah.

894
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:10,611
Scott: Alright.

895
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:15,260
Rym: So it is possible that this comic is catering to that demographic.

896
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:16,500
Scott: Possible.

897
00:48:17,408 --> 00:48:17,778
Scott: That's fun.

898
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,280
Rym: Yeah, but it's not the worst webcomic.

899
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,820
Scott: I'm not judging you on your demographic.

900
00:48:23,704 --> 00:48:25,880
Rym: Even if someone actually tries to cater to that demographic?

901
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:33,700
Scott: I mean look, am I going to say that Penny Arcade is good because it caters to people like us and it's bad because it doesn't cater to little kids?

902
00:48:33,902 --> 00:48:33,945
Scott: No.

903
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:41,080
Scott: Am I going to say that Gronk by Katie Cook, which is awesome by the way, is bad because it caters to little kids and doesn't cater to me?

904
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:41,266
Scott: No.

905
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:46,480
Scott: So what does it matter if it caters to a sexual deviancy as opposed to an age group?

906
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,060
Rym: I mean we just spent more minutes than I ever thought I would in my life defending furry porn.

907
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:51,829
Scott: Yeah.

908
00:48:53,181 --> 00:49:03,220
Rym: But to read the end here because I was talking about the Mary Sue stuff, our titular watch named Annie Anonymous is a person who can do no wrong and if she does do wrong it's waved away and she suffers no consequences.

909
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,279
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing.

910
00:49:05,781 --> 00:49:11,495
Scott: He's complaining about the long term plot which I do agree should be part of the determination of the worst webcomic.

911
00:49:11,876 --> 00:49:13,240
Scott: if the comic has a long term plot.

912
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:18,740
Scott: But it can't be reasonably expected for anyone to judge it if they haven't read the whole thing.

913
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:24,140
Rym: Yeah, every random page I read was someone being turned into something and some kind of episodic humor about that.

914
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,580
Scott: There was a whole chapter about like clones doing something that was weird.

915
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,579
Rym: Doing something, eh?

916
00:49:28,742 --> 00:49:28,829
Rym: Yeah.

917
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:29,264
Rym: Eh, eh.

918
00:49:30,046 --> 00:49:30,320
Scott: Anyway.

919
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,420
Scott: So yeah, the watch, just another mediocre webcomic really.

920
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,159
Scott: I don't see what the big deal is.

921
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,800
Rym: It doesn't delve into the realm of worst.

922
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,439
Rym: Control alt delete.

923
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:42,500
Rym: Okay.

924
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,020
Scott: Control alt delete.

925
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,480
Scott: Oh no, you skipped over Electric Retard.

926
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:46,842
Scott: Oh.

927
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:52,459
Scott: Yeah, so Electric Retard looks like it was drawn with the MS Paint and I think it was.

928
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:58,960
Scott: But this is basically another one of those try to be offensive on purpose with MS Paint.

929
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,100
Scott: Sort of the same way the other one was.

930
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,940
Scott: Only the art in this is much worse.

931
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,100
Scott: But while the art is worse, the design is actually better.

932
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:12,660
Scott: It's like his whole sight is drawn with MS Paint and the same sort of almost crayon MS Paint style.

933
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:13,820
Scott: The comic, everything.

934
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,018
Scott: So while it's bad.

935
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,220
Rym: He's got his own MS Paint ad.

936
00:50:18,003 --> 00:50:19,258
Rym: With Adolf Hitler on it.

937
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,059
Rym: So you know what you're getting into.

938
00:50:22,301 --> 00:50:22,856
Rym: And uh.

939
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,180
Rym: It's pretty bad though.

940
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,239
Scott: It is pretty bad.

941
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,540
Scott: And it's pretty much like, you know, like the offensiveness.

942
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,360
Scott: Like the other one was like trying to make a joke with the offensiveness.

943
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,600
Rym: This one is just offensive.

944
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,720
Scott: This one is pretty much just show you something extreme with no joke.

945
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,800
Scott: Like the second comic.

946
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:40,759
Scott: Is it the second one?

947
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,600
Scott: Yeah, the second comic and the whole thing.

948
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,520
Scott: There's only like a 40th or something of them.

949
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,219
Scott: You can read them all.

950
00:50:45,946 --> 00:50:47,720
Scott: The second one was called First Born Son.

951
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,299
Scott: And it's like a mom in the hospital with the baby and the dad.

952
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:52,899
Scott: And the dad's like, wow, my first born son.

953
00:50:53,322 --> 00:50:54,159
Scott: Can I hold him, honey?

954
00:50:54,543 --> 00:50:55,119
Scott: Here you go.

955
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:01,560
Scott: So then some criminal shows up with a jail, you know, black and white stripe jailbird shirt.

956
00:51:02,865 --> 00:51:03,759
Scott: He grabs the dad.

957
00:51:04,985 --> 00:51:06,820
Scott: The baby falls on the floor with his head bleeding.

958
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:08,856
Scott: The dude drives a wood chipper into the room.

959
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,980
Scott: And then he jerks off while the dad is going through the wood chipper.

960
00:51:14,302 --> 00:51:16,317
Scott: It's like, it's like, dude, that's it.

961
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,220
Rym: I mean, the parking lot is full, was clever in its horrifyingness.

962
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:25,620
Rym: This is just, this is just, you know, the worst one is titled Pimp.

963
00:51:26,705 --> 00:51:27,559
Scott: Uh, which number is that?

964
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,658
Rym: So here's the plot.

965
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,860
Rym: There is a, there is a black man who is in fact a pimp, a pretty style and pimp.

966
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,360
Rym: He's walking.

967
00:51:35,027 --> 00:51:35,378
Scott: I see him.

968
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:44,379
Rym: Another black man appears with a gun with a gun and the pimp man raises his fist and says pimp style and transforms into pimp man.

969
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,398
Rym: Bullets do not hurt him.

970
00:51:46,901 --> 00:51:48,119
Rym: He stops this bad guy.

971
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:55,280
Rym: A white man sees him and says the words brown up, turns into clan man.

972
00:51:55,881 --> 00:52:06,420
Rym: They have a fight that involves a whip and a gigantic black man's penis being wielded like a urine spewing whip.

973
00:52:07,226 --> 00:52:08,619
Rym: And it ends with him being lynched.

974
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:10,659
Rym: Great.

975
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,558
Rym: That was a joke.

976
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,120
Rym: That was, that was fantastic.

977
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,240
Scott: He's not lynched.

978
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,216
Scott: He was burned on a cross.

979
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,576
Rym: I guess he's crucified and then burned.

980
00:52:19,365 --> 00:52:19,616
Rym: Yeah.

981
00:52:20,844 --> 00:52:22,900
Scott: Uh, yeah, it's just offensive.

982
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,700
Rym: Like at no point is there a punchline.

983
00:52:24,802 --> 00:52:25,940
Rym: It's just horrible.

984
00:52:27,085 --> 00:52:28,220
Scott: Uh, it's pretty bad.

985
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,596
Scott: This is maybe the worst yet ish.

986
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:31,780
Rym: Yeah.

987
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:37,580
Rym: I think this so far is the worst comic we've actually talked about because it has no redeeming qualities.

988
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:38,480
Rym: No improvement.

989
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:47,319
Scott: The only good thing about it is the design, the graphic design as a whole, the unification of the site and the comic is the only good thing going for it.

990
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,920
Rym: So his fact is basically like I'm banned in Germany, which is probably true.

991
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:53,392
Scott: Yes.

992
00:52:54,362 --> 00:52:55,359
Rym: Uh, you can't contact me.

993
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,679
Rym: There's no contact info.

994
00:52:57,364 --> 00:52:58,300
Rym: I draw it all myself.

995
00:52:59,010 --> 00:52:59,280
Scott: Okay.

996
00:52:59,884 --> 00:53:00,940
Rym: Uh, you can't take me down.

997
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:01,999
Rym: People try all the time.

998
00:53:02,522 --> 00:53:02,818
Scott: All right.

999
00:53:03,422 --> 00:53:10,460
Rym: So I would imagine the sole purpose of this comic is to instill outrage and then enjoy said outrage.

1000
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,880
Scott: If this guy is trolling, then he's the best web comic ever.

1001
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:16,739
Rym: No, because he doesn't, most people would avoid it.

1002
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,760
Scott: The fact that I did not know about it is a significant redemption if he's trolling.

1003
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,060
Rym: The fact that I did not know about it until it was submitted to us means that he's failing.

1004
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:29,919
Rym: Also, if you want offensive comics, read the parking lot is full.

1005
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:30,416
Rym: That's true.

1006
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:31,616
Scott: All right.

1007
00:53:32,023 --> 00:53:33,760
Scott: So we already mentioned that.

1008
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,698
Scott: That's so don't add an extra one.

1009
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:37,479
Scott: We re round a bit.

1010
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:38,356
Scott: Okay.

1011
00:53:39,204 --> 00:53:40,159
Scott: So what's this one?

1012
00:53:40,661 --> 00:53:40,963
Scott: Oh boy.

1013
00:53:44,366 --> 00:53:45,160
Scott: I don't even remember this one.

1014
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:45,776
Scott: I got loaded up.

1015
00:53:45,962 --> 00:53:46,539
Rym: It's got good art.

1016
00:53:47,145 --> 00:53:47,640
Rym: Like it's okay.

1017
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:47,940
Rym: Art.

1018
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:49,480
Scott: I'm waiting for it to load.

1019
00:53:49,944 --> 00:53:51,160
Rym: I don't remember this one either.

1020
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:51,719
Rym: Actually.

1021
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,519
Scott: No, I remember.

1022
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:53,860
Scott: I just don't remember it by name.

1023
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,560
Scott: I definitely remember reading it cause I remember one that was called.

1024
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,538
Scott: So you're a cartoonist.

1025
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:58,813
Rym: I mean the arts, right?

1026
00:53:59,580 --> 00:53:59,979
Scott: Yeah, this one.

1027
00:54:00,185 --> 00:54:00,700
Scott: This one's okay.

1028
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,660
Rym: I didn't have anything like terrible to say about it.

1029
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:02,800
Scott: Yeah.

1030
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,900
Scott: The only thing about this one is that it just, there was no funniness.

1031
00:54:07,725 --> 00:54:08,559
Scott: It's like it wasn't a joke.

1032
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,760
Scott: I didn't, I didn't laugh at any of them.

1033
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:17,720
Rym: It's almost more like pages from a book that itself is a single comic as opposed to a web comic.

1034
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:22,800
Rym: Like each individual page doesn't really do much for you on its own.

1035
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:32,540
Scott: It's almost like someone who was in, you know, was like in art school and had like an assignment to draw a web comic and they had to keep drawing the web comic as long as they were in school.

1036
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,796
Scott: That was their like job, you know, like they had to do it.

1037
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:41,420
Scott: And they weren't very good at writing or telling jokes, but you know, their art is actually, you know, it's art.

1038
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,260
Scott: It's way better than a lot of, 90% of the other ones that were submitted, you know.

1039
00:54:46,663 --> 00:54:46,754
Scott: Yeah.

1040
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:49,379
Rym: It's nowhere near the worst web comic.

1041
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,960
Scott: Not even remotely close to the worst web comic.

1042
00:54:53,343 --> 00:54:54,459
Scott: What did the submissions say?

1043
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,620
Scott: Why did they say it was the worst?

1044
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:55,958
Scott: Let's see.

1045
00:54:56,402 --> 00:55:02,780
Scott: Tom Preston is a terrible writer whose every comic says it's tearing down, oh it's the raw, yeah, it's tearing down straw men.

1046
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:03,679
Scott: That I didn't get.

1047
00:55:03,942 --> 00:55:04,639
Scott: I didn't get that.

1048
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,740
Rym: Because of all the random strips I read, I didn't see a straw man.

1049
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,816
Rym: I'm going to try to look for a straw man while you read the rest of that.

1050
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:10,513
Scott: Yeah.

1051
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,110
Scott: You're a cartoonist is basically a compilation of every misused Garfield punchline every one.

1052
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,140
Scott: His best comic couldn't be as good as all of Jim Davis worst comics.

1053
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:23,060
Scott: Actually, the art is better than the more recent digital Garfields.

1054
00:55:24,327 --> 00:55:26,399
Scott: You know, I like the older Garfield art a lot better.

1055
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,178
Scott: And it's about equal and funniness to Garfield, which is not funny at all.

1056
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,740
Scott: Maybe if we did, so you're a cartoonist minus something, it would be hilarious.

1057
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:40,080
Scott: Let's see, here's one that might be tearing down straw men.

1058
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,920
Scott: Things that make me want to head desk.

1059
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:43,098
Rym: I was just looking at that one.

1060
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,240
Scott: Confusing the word animation, confusing Disney with other companies.

1061
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,020
Scott: The main, the anti-pony mentality.

1062
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:50,839
Scott: When was this done?

1063
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:52,540
Scott: Was this done in the pony times?

1064
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:53,639
Scott: What's the date on this comic?

1065
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,151
Scott: I don't know.

1066
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:54,690
Scott: Yeah.

1067
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:55,417
Scott: MLP fim.

1068
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:57,639
Scott: He likes, he's a pony guy.

1069
00:55:58,223 --> 00:55:59,220
Scott: This is a recent comic.

1070
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,899
Rym: Anyone who likes ponies can't be bad.

1071
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:01,560
Rym: That's right.

1072
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,120
Scott: It's automatically not the worst comic because a guy likes ponies.

1073
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,840
Scott: Uh, okay boys.

1074
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:08,637
Scott: I don't see what's wrong with this.

1075
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,999
Scott: He's got a troll in the last panel.

1076
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:11,673
Scott: You know.

1077
00:56:12,943 --> 00:56:13,060
Rym: Yeah.

1078
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:17,120
Rym: I didn't find anything offensive to my sensibilities in this comic.

1079
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:18,800
Scott: I did not either.

1080
00:56:19,226 --> 00:56:19,576
Scott: I don't know.

1081
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:25,080
Scott: I think that a lot of people submitted comics that were just personally offensive to them, right?

1082
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:29,299
Scott: Like, you know, someone submitted furries cause they are really, you know, can't, they.

1083
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,380
Rym: I think they submitted furries because they just wanted to force us to refer to them.

1084
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:32,715
Scott: That also.

1085
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,034
Scott: But like, you know, someone submitted, you know, Mama Is cause.

1086
00:56:36,074 --> 00:56:39,720
Scott: you know, Mama Is is way crazy lefty and they're probably somewhat righty.

1087
00:56:39,921 --> 00:56:41,860
Rym: Or it's just because it's so crazy.

1088
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:42,435
Scott: Yeah.

1089
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,320
Rym: I mean, I'm glad it was submitted cause I never would have seen that otherwise.

1090
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:45,855
Scott: Me either.

1091
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:49,180
Scott: Um, well, you know, I'm not glad anything was submitted.

1092
00:56:51,143 --> 00:57:01,779
Scott: But you know, I think a lot of people submitted things that were just personally offensive to them and their own sensibilities and therefore judged it as the worst web comic as opposed to judging it as a web comic.

1093
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:02,459
Rym: You know what?

1094
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,500
Rym: Here's a random funny one.

1095
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,720
Scott: More impartial criteria.

1096
00:57:05,101 --> 00:57:10,639
Rym: Two people are at a convention and one of the older guys like, excuse me a moment, hot chick at three o'clock, he disappears.

1097
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:16,660
Rym: He comes back disturbed and the main character says, I didn't know you had a thing for Sephiroth.

1098
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:19,596
Rym: And the old guy's like, I don't even know what that is.

1099
00:57:21,047 --> 00:57:21,538
Scott: It's not bad.

1100
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:24,620
Rym: So this is far from a terrible comic.

1101
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:24,920
Scott: Yeah.

1102
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,860
Scott: I'm not going to read it, but it's not bad.

1103
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,620
Rym: I mean, can put this side by side with electric retard and uh, yeah, right.

1104
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:33,220
Scott: Yeah.

1105
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,400
Scott: Electric retard is currently winning.

1106
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:35,259
Scott: The next one.

1107
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:40,500
Scott: This actually of all the ones that were submitted, I actually liked this one the most.

1108
00:57:40,722 --> 00:57:42,420
Rym: It's actually kind of cute and funny.

1109
00:57:42,562 --> 00:57:42,648
Scott: Yeah.

1110
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,880
Scott: The modest Medusa.

1111
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,959
Scott: So basically the story is there's a dude.

1112
00:57:46,243 --> 00:57:47,420
Scott: He lives in a house, right?

1113
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,600
Scott: And the beginning art awful.

1114
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,720
Scott: And the more recent art significantly improved from the oldest art in this comic.

1115
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,940
Rym: It's not, I would not call the beginning art awful.

1116
00:57:55,463 --> 00:57:56,016
Scott: It's pretty bad.

1117
00:57:56,582 --> 00:57:58,960
Rym: Uh, you've seen electric retard.

1118
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:05,380
Scott: I'm just saying, but the dude basically just comes home and finds his Medusa, little cute Medusa girl in his closet.

1119
00:58:06,661 --> 00:58:08,400
Scott: And it's kind of cute and funny.

1120
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:10,580
Scott: It's like cute Medusa girl.

1121
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,005
Scott: Yay.

1122
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:11,649
Scott: Yup.

1123
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:19,438
Scott: And she has, I love it when her snakes eat things and she's like trying to eat something and it's, she always wants to eat with the choco something you have in the snakes like steal it from her.

1124
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,918
Scott: She wants to eat choco dials and then the snakes on her head eat the choco dial and then she cries.

1125
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:23,578
Rym: So let's see.

1126
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,800
Rym: Why did, why was it submitted?

1127
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Scott: I mean, it is moe, you know, pure straight up.

1128
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,559
Rym: It is moe.

1129
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,820
Rym: But so let's read the quote.

1130
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:40,620
Rym: It seems an almost cute fantasy comic in the guy gets saddled with a kid vein until you realize the cute monster is his fat fantasy and the first thing he does is pee on her.

1131
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,980
Scott: So I read reading that I had to go forward to find, you know, I read until I got to the.

1132
00:58:45,201 --> 00:58:48,820
Rym: I was reading the whole comic thinking, when does this turn into child porn?

1133
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:59,260
Scott: Basically she's in the toilet because it's water in there and she's a snake and then he goes to the bathroom not realizing she's in there and it's not porny in any way.

1134
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,773
Scott: Now this might be, might be right.

1135
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,717
Rym: One of those ones where, you know, that comic that pretends it's not exactly right.

1136
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:23,159
Scott: But it's the thing is it's done in the same way as an asamanga dao or a yotsuba or a pre time skip, you know, bunny drop right to where there are many redeeming.

1137
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,380
Scott: There are many redeeming qualities, right?

1138
00:59:26,741 --> 00:59:47,679
Scott: Even though it is cute with a little Medusa girl and the fapness will not enter into it compared to, say, a chubra or a kiss excess or many other things, you know, even a love Hina to where, you know, that there is sort of this implied, you know, porniness that they're sort of hiding, sort of not.

1139
00:59:47,861 --> 00:59:49,620
Scott: It's like it's not even implied.

1140
00:59:49,801 --> 00:59:52,296
Scott: It's only added in the minds of the reader 100 percent.

1141
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:53,482
Scott: Right.

1142
00:59:53,543 --> 00:59:57,000
Scott: Maybe also the writer, but it's not in the comic is my point.

1143
00:59:57,705 --> 00:59:58,580
Rym: It's just I don't know.

1144
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:58,924
Rym: I don't know.

1145
00:59:58,984 --> 01:00:00,100
Rym: It's not the worst comic.

1146
01:00:00,241 --> 01:00:02,280
Scott: I actually kind of want to read it because it's cute.

1147
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:03,047
Rym: It is cute.

1148
01:00:03,188 --> 01:00:04,059
Scott: It's very cute.

1149
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:07,018
Rym: So I guess I can see why someone might say that comic.

1150
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:08,505
Rym: I'm kind of sad.

1151
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:08,967
Rym: And how much?

1152
01:00:09,348 --> 01:00:09,951
Rym: why is every?

1153
01:00:10,031 --> 01:00:15,020
Rym: I just noticed the previous control of the lead submission also says that comic that pretends it isn't right.

1154
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:15,564
Scott: I don't know.

1155
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:16,940
Scott: No one's faffing it's all delete.

1156
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:17,672
Scott: I'll tell you that much.

1157
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:18,020
Rym: All right.

1158
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:24,339
Rym: So let's talk about the next one because someone tried to be a jerk, but this guy's wrong and I can argue it pretty succinctly.

1159
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,579
Scott: I'll let you handle this then.

1160
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,538
Rym: So I'm going to read his whole submission because he's he's impinging on XKCD.

1161
01:00:30,742 --> 01:00:34,680
Rym: And I feel like his criticisms are actually objectively wrong.

1162
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,260
Scott: Well, so far he submitted the best comic yet.

1163
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:37,821
Rym: Yes.

1164
01:00:38,162 --> 01:00:41,900
Rym: In fact, one of my top 10 Webcomics anyway.

1165
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:45,219
Rym: Yeah, I know XKCD is a favorite of scrims.

1166
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:45,944
Rym: But yeah.

1167
01:00:45,964 --> 01:00:46,630
Scott: Then why are you trying to?

1168
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:47,034
Scott: you're not going to.

1169
01:00:47,054 --> 01:00:48,851
Scott: you know, you're not going to win the contest with this.

1170
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:49,680
Rym: You got balls, kid.

1171
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,859
Rym: I'll give you that, Ben.

1172
01:00:52,143 --> 01:00:53,640
Rym: But I'm going to buck the trend here.

1173
01:00:54,121 --> 01:01:03,960
Rym: XKCD is a lackluster, tryhard comic that panders to the pseudo nerdy demographic by playing on entry level science jokes that anyone with a high school education could get.

1174
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:12,242
Rym: The author writes the comics in such a fashion that readers with even a basic grasp of mathematics and pat themselves on the back, lengthen to friends and pretend they are intelligent.

1175
01:01:12,524 --> 01:01:15,380
Rym: In short, the math and science humor is shallow and pretentious.

1176
01:01:16,561 --> 01:01:24,540
Rym: There's more, but I don't know why you would say that humor is shallow and pretentious just because it's presented in an accessible fashion.

1177
01:01:25,142 --> 01:01:38,839
Scott: Also, while the math and science in XKCD is presentable and comprehensible by nerds such as us, you have a great overestimation of the science and math knowledge of anyone who's graduated from high school, at least the United States.

1178
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,559
Scott: Most people would not understand even the simplest of pie jokes in XKCD.

1179
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,100
Rym: Never mind the fact you do not yet know this.

1180
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:50,659
Scott: This submitter clearly does not yet know how stupid the world is.

1181
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:53,159
Scott: And you are lucky, my good sir.

1182
01:01:53,501 --> 01:02:03,100
Rym: Never mind the fact that the comic, you know, XKCD does a really good job, I think, of making some very difficult to understand concepts very accessible to people.

1183
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,860
Rym: I mean, half the time, what's his comic?

1184
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:08,540
Rym: It's a really interesting infographic that is pretty well researched.

1185
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:20,280
Scott: Yeah, and it takes, you know, while it sticks in lines most of the time, you know, he actually gets more expression out of those stick figures that half these comics we've gone over get out of full color everything.

1186
01:02:20,562 --> 01:02:23,240
Rym: Oh, let's let's go on because he continues his rant.

1187
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:23,701
Scott: OK.

1188
01:02:23,982 --> 01:02:26,492
Rym: There is no significant improvement in the art style.

1189
01:02:26,653 --> 01:02:30,520
Rym: in the many years XKCD has been running from stick figures to stick figures.

1190
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,080
Rym: Now, you know what, dude, that's wrong.

1191
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,099
Rym: Look at the early comics.

1192
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:35,819
Rym: They're really poorly drawn stick figures.

1193
01:02:36,141 --> 01:02:40,162
Scott: They're much better drawn now, not to mention some of the comics where it isn't just sticks.

1194
01:02:40,202 --> 01:02:44,120
Scott: There are quite a few where there will be, you know, sort of like backgrounds.

1195
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:44,601
Scott: There's some.

1196
01:02:44,621 --> 01:02:49,840
Scott: there was a few night comics with a starry sky that were quite, you know, much more than just sticks.

1197
01:02:49,860 --> 01:03:01,023
Scott: But also the infographics, you know, especially, you know, he definitely goes all out with with clever constructions of, you know, information design, let alone the art itself.

1198
01:03:01,184 --> 01:03:03,440
Rym: The art has improved markedly.

1199
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:10,520
Rym: And if you can't see that because you're looking at the surface level of saying it's still a stick figure, then you shouldn't read Order of the Stick either.

1200
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,245
Scott: That's right.

1201
01:03:11,508 --> 01:03:12,639
Rym: Because Order of the Stick, same deal.

1202
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:17,322
Rym: The character designs are very simple and you look at it now and say, wow, that hasn't progressed.

1203
01:03:17,643 --> 01:03:25,840
Rym: Then you look at the first comic and realize how far it's come and how subtle improvements make these very simple characters very expressive.

1204
01:03:26,562 --> 01:03:28,820
Rym: These are some of the most expressive stick figures I've ever seen.

1205
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,080
Rym: XKCD is one of my favorite and most heartwarming comic comics.

1206
01:03:32,921 --> 01:03:37,140
Rym: And I think your criticism of the art and the accessibility is very misplaced.

1207
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:42,369
Scott: So the last thing he says is that he says he's hope he's made a decent case showing why it's his least favorite.

1208
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:43,480
Scott: Your case is not decent.

1209
01:03:44,427 --> 01:03:45,820
Rym: You can say that it's your least favorite.

1210
01:03:46,242 --> 01:03:50,400
Scott: Yeah, but he said he hoped he made a decent case and no, he did not.

1211
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,807
Rym: Well, no, he made a decent case.

1212
01:03:51,847 --> 01:04:06,765
Rym: as to why he doesn't like it, because many people will look at simple art and the triggers like this logic in the brain of this is simple art, therefore it is bad or has not improved from some earlier state as opposed to looking at the simple art and saying, wow,

1213
01:04:07,147 --> 01:04:07,549
Scott: this is

1214
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,839
Rym: very elegantly designed simple art.

1215
01:04:11,342 --> 01:04:11,603
Scott: All right.

1216
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:15,746
Scott: So somebody thought they'd be funny and submitted a worst webcomic called worst webcomic.

1217
01:04:15,786 --> 01:04:17,659
Scott: It's even at worst webcomic dot com.

1218
01:04:18,262 --> 01:04:20,479
Scott: So you think that this would just win straight up.

1219
01:04:20,821 --> 01:04:28,020
Scott: But actually, no, it's really you know, it's another one of those ones where it's like, why does this guy think it's the worst?

1220
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,560
Scott: Because, I mean, it's not funny at all.

1221
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:31,159
Scott: I did not laugh at a single one of these.

1222
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:37,539
Scott: And he tends to use this trick where he takes some existing graphic and put some words on it like he does some Cookie Monster.

1223
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,680
Scott: He does some the two most recent ones.

1224
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:46,396
Scott: He's got a Cookie Monster who's depressed with a psychiatrist and he's got a Tootsie Roll Pop, you know, as Mr.

1225
01:04:46,578 --> 01:04:46,700
Scott: Owl.

1226
01:04:46,862 --> 01:04:48,339
Scott: But it's a dolphin and the dolphins a dick.

1227
01:04:48,941 --> 01:04:52,420
Scott: But none of the comics are actually funny.

1228
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,535
Rym: Some of them are OK.

1229
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:54,687
Rym: They're not.

1230
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:55,659
Rym: They're not.

1231
01:04:56,001 --> 01:05:00,180
Scott: I didn't even so much as like smile or chuckle or even feel an internal laugh.

1232
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:04,580
Rym: OK, here's one guy's asking a chemist or something.

1233
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:06,719
Rym: So what happens to all the used chemicals from the lab?

1234
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:09,760
Rym: And the chemist is like, well, it's actually a very complicated process.

1235
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:16,579
Rym: First, you have to classify the chemicals in terms of acidity, composition, reaction with other chemicals, flammability, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1236
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,220
Rym: You have from the organization and the guy interrupts.

1237
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,660
Rym: He's like, you just throw them all away, don't you?

1238
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,172
Rym: He's like between two a.m.

1239
01:05:22,212 --> 01:05:23,019
Rym: and four a.m.

1240
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:23,783
Rym: Yes.

1241
01:05:24,913 --> 01:05:25,740
Scott: Well, here look at this one.

1242
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,659
Scott: It's like you've seen the latest episode of Teen Mom.

1243
01:05:28,002 --> 01:05:29,060
Scott: No, me either.

1244
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:30,602
Scott: It's like what?

1245
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:35,477
Rym: It's not even he's clearly making fun of the fact that Teen Mom is not a liked or known show.

1246
01:05:36,262 --> 01:05:38,300
Scott: Yeah, your webcomic is not liked or known either.

1247
01:05:39,361 --> 01:05:43,020
Scott: You know, up with this, you know, this isn't the worst, but there's really nothing.

1248
01:05:43,101 --> 01:05:45,580
Scott: It's not that there's nothing good about memorable.

1249
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,105
Scott: Yeah, it's it's.

1250
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:50,359
Scott: it's as black as black can be, I think.

1251
01:05:51,303 --> 01:05:51,747
Scott: I don't know.

1252
01:05:51,767 --> 01:05:53,119
Scott: I really just had so much to say about it.

1253
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:53,662
Scott: So, Blair.

1254
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,140
Rym: Well, the thing is, here's why I'm saying it's black, dude.

1255
01:05:56,281 --> 01:05:57,420
Rym: I'm going to let you in a little secret.

1256
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:01,279
Rym: The guy who submitted it and never mind.

1257
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,029
Rym: Never mind.

1258
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:02,560
Rym: I got nothing.

1259
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,280
Scott: We're just going to skip that one because it's so bland.

1260
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,287
Scott: Has nothing to go on.

1261
01:06:05,307 --> 01:06:06,980
Rym: I got nothing to say about the next one.

1262
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:08,920
Scott: I liked a lot, actually.

1263
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,398
Scott: I liked it just about as much as I like.

1264
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:10,826
Rym: All right.

1265
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:11,540
Rym: This one.

1266
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:14,855
Rym: I actually did like this one, too, just because the art is actually really.

1267
01:06:14,895 --> 01:06:19,980
Scott: it's savage chickens and it's Post-it notes, but not always a single Post-it note.

1268
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,045
Scott: It's you know, it's like.

1269
01:06:21,126 --> 01:06:23,440
Scott: sometimes it's a it's basically yellow background, really.

1270
01:06:24,321 --> 01:06:27,233
Scott: Sometimes it's more than one Post-it note long and is cute.

1271
01:06:27,273 --> 01:06:30,640
Scott: chickens with sort of far side ish jokes.

1272
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:32,083
Scott: Right.

1273
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:34,540
Scott: Like endangered species that nobody cares about.

1274
01:06:34,821 --> 01:06:36,459
Scott: The crinkly bag at the movies, Tiger.

1275
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:39,979
Rym: Once upon a the abruptly ending story.

1276
01:06:40,201 --> 01:06:40,522
Scott: Right.

1277
01:06:41,326 --> 01:06:44,320
Scott: I feel like everyone wants a piece of me and it's a pie that's talking.

1278
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:46,226
Scott: I get I don't know.

1279
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:48,320
Rym: This is far from the worst webcomic.

1280
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,357
Rym: It's actually pretty OK.

1281
01:06:49,821 --> 01:06:50,429
Scott: I think it's cute.

1282
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:51,178
Scott: I'm actually read it.

1283
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:51,603
Scott: Yeah.

1284
01:06:51,623 --> 01:06:51,968
Scott: Maybe.

1285
01:06:52,373 --> 01:06:52,859
Rym: What do you say?

1286
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,420
Rym: He's basically the guy submitted.

1287
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,447
Rym: It says it isn't funny.

1288
01:06:55,487 --> 01:06:57,039
Rym: Let me make sure he didn't say it was a fap comic.

1289
01:06:58,462 --> 01:06:58,966
Rym: I feel like that.

1290
01:06:59,047 --> 01:06:59,269
Rym: OK.

1291
01:06:59,289 --> 01:07:00,700
Rym: He did not say it was a fap comic.

1292
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,820
Scott: He said that bad art tries to be funny and fails, never improves or get better.

1293
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:05,382
Scott: Time goes on.

1294
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:09,506
Scott: That is true is that it's basically the same for its whole length and it is quite long.

1295
01:07:10,616 --> 01:07:11,160
Scott: Pretty simple idea.

1296
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,292
Scott: Try chickens on post-it notes.

1297
01:07:12,313 --> 01:07:12,880
Scott: Hilarity ensues.

1298
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,920
Scott: Unfortunately, there appears to be a step missing at humor.

1299
01:07:15,461 --> 01:07:16,839
Scott: So I think it was funny.

1300
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:17,563
Scott: Kinda.

1301
01:07:18,128 --> 01:07:19,560
Rym: I think we might have a winner.

1302
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:25,000
Scott: It's about as funny as every newspaper strip that's in the newspaper today.

1303
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,520
Rym: It is funnier than any newspaper strip that is in the newspaper today.

1304
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,240
Scott: This might actually be in some newspapers.

1305
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:30,704
Scott: Who knows?

1306
01:07:31,432 --> 01:07:32,099
Rym: Actually, you know what?

1307
01:07:32,601 --> 01:07:34,360
Rym: It should be in some newspapers about that level.

1308
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,280
Rym: So here we come to something that stands out.

1309
01:07:38,401 --> 01:07:39,658
Rym: This is a cut above the rest.

1310
01:07:40,201 --> 01:07:43,760
Scott: This is definitely the worst so far of what we have gone through.

1311
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,079
Scott: It may hold out till the end and be the worst webcomic.

1312
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:55,380
Rym: To quote the entry, this is a man who has been so broken as to the point where he thinks that an abhorrent act of racism and anti-Semitism is liberal.

1313
01:07:57,181 --> 01:07:58,326
Rym: What were the categories?

1314
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:04,420
Rym: The aspects of worstness, bad art, bad writing, racist, sexist, tries to be funny and fails, never gets better.

1315
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,419
Rym: The author is crazy.

1316
01:08:06,444 --> 01:08:07,259
Rym: And it's all of those.

1317
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,580
Rym: It's called Billy the Heretic.

1318
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:11,740
Rym: I don't even know where to begin.

1319
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,440
Rym: The website looks like those kinds of websites.

1320
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:18,419
Rym: What where Jack Chick style craziness appears.

1321
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:19,321
Scott: Right.

1322
01:08:19,341 --> 01:08:22,899
Scott: You know how some people are racist, but they're not just overtly racist, right?

1323
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:25,897
Scott: They're not just like, you know, kill all Jews, right?

1324
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:31,520
Scott: This guy is like, kill all Jews straight up like he's not even trying.

1325
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,537
Scott: He's like he thinks he's just OK.

1326
01:08:34,581 --> 01:08:36,580
Rym: Well, here I'll read a comic, Billy the Heretic.

1327
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,399
Rym: There's a plane that's flying and the father is like, happy birthday, son.

1328
01:08:40,981 --> 01:08:44,279
Rym: For your surprise, just tell the captain anywhere in the world you want to go.

1329
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:53,000
Rym: So he says to the captain, quote, Captain, please land in the nearest black city that is generally safe, clean.

1330
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,719
Rym: Any country is fine.

1331
01:08:56,301 --> 01:08:58,760
Rym: And there's nowhere for the plane to land, that's the joke.

1332
01:09:00,685 --> 01:09:03,000
Rym: Yeah, and that is probably one of the least offensive.

1333
01:09:03,443 --> 01:09:05,379
Scott: Yeah, let me let me pick another one.

1334
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,979
Rym: Oh, the Anne Frank ones are pretty bad.

1335
01:09:07,723 --> 01:09:09,439
Rym: I don't think he believes that the Holocaust happened.

1336
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:10,471
Scott: Probably not.

1337
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:10,899
Scott: Let's see.

1338
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,640
Scott: Anne Frank was a Jewish girl who was gassed to death at a death camp called Auschwitz.

1339
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:18,279
Scott: Miss tell Eli didn't Anne Frank leave Auschwitz alive?

1340
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,180
Scott: Well, the evil Nazis took her somewhere and gassed her to death.

1341
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:26,099
Scott: Then please instruct the class as to how she died of typhus during a typhus epidemic that killed thousands of other innocent Germans.

1342
01:09:26,801 --> 01:09:27,600
Scott: You knew it didn't happen.

1343
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,120
Scott: Gassing Jews is hate, hate.

1344
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:29,906
Scott: Do you hear me?

1345
01:09:29,947 --> 01:09:30,658
Scott: It is hate, hate, hate.

1346
01:09:31,341 --> 01:09:35,959
Scott: Isn't it true that you... Isn't true that you hate, hate and I mean, really hate?

1347
01:09:36,982 --> 01:09:42,040
Rym: He seems to be against interracial marriage, against black people, right?

1348
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:46,300
Rym: Against women, against Jews, against liberals.

1349
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:53,680
Scott: Yeah, this guy now, you know, we may disagree with him and someone could write an equally crazy left comic easily.

1350
01:09:54,342 --> 01:09:57,140
Scott: So we can't, you know, obviously we disagree with him.

1351
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,980
Scott: But and it's racist and horrible.

1352
01:09:59,141 --> 01:10:01,580
Scott: But that's not the only thing that makes it horrible.

1353
01:10:02,621 --> 01:10:13,270
Scott: Is that not even the racist jokes are funny and they're not not even actively grown and painful, but they're also like many of them.

1354
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:18,080
Rym: end on this point where it's obvious that the author is trying to be clever.

1355
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,480
Rym: Like he thinks like, aha, look at this witty balmo.

1356
01:10:21,822 --> 01:10:25,020
Rym: I have showed those liberals that there was no wittiness whatsoever.

1357
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:26,423
Scott: None.

1358
01:10:26,928 --> 01:10:28,140
Scott: It was minus wittiness.

1359
01:10:28,922 --> 01:10:31,760
Scott: It's just overt with no subtlety to it at all.

1360
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,480
Scott: It's just blah, blah, blah.

1361
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,520
Scott: Kill all Jews, blah, blah, blah.

1362
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:36,537
Scott: Black people are sucky.

1363
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:37,605
Scott: It's like, what?

1364
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:39,480
Scott: That's all you got?

1365
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:40,875
Rym: He's got a fact up.

1366
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:42,119
Scott: What's the fact?

1367
01:10:42,682 --> 01:10:44,120
Rym: OK, what the fuck is up with this website?

1368
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,419
Rym: I made this site to teach people about the Jewish community.

1369
01:10:49,688 --> 01:10:49,920
Scott: Gay.

1370
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:54,539
Rym: Do you hate Jews?

1371
01:10:54,781 --> 01:10:55,900
Rym: No, but I find them hypocritical.

1372
01:10:56,508 --> 01:10:56,880
Scott: All right.

1373
01:10:57,365 --> 01:10:58,700
Rym: Were you really adopted by Jews?

1374
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,799
Rym: I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.

1375
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:05,539
Rym: Apparently he was adopted by a Jewish family and resented it.

1376
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:06,306
Scott: Yes.

1377
01:11:06,347 --> 01:11:06,472
Scott: OK.

1378
01:11:09,461 --> 01:11:11,780
Scott: Yeah, so, yeah, it's just awful.

1379
01:11:13,141 --> 01:11:14,319
Scott: All the website was also awful.

1380
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:16,320
Scott: Everything about this is awful.

1381
01:11:16,962 --> 01:11:18,338
Scott: There is not one good thing about it.

1382
01:11:19,124 --> 01:11:20,740
Scott: It is it is nine minus a billion.

1383
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:23,779
Scott: It might win, which means which means it would lose.

1384
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:27,277
Rym: I don't even know what else I can say like it.

1385
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,380
Scott: I'm dumbfounded by it, it's because it's basically a crazy conspiracy website.

1386
01:11:35,103 --> 01:11:37,440
Scott: It looks like it just in the happens to be a Webcomic.

1387
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:46,480
Scott: It's like if time it was it was Jew Cube, the comic, but it's so offensive and crazy.

1388
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:49,519
Rym: But I get the impression that there's no trolling going on here.

1389
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:51,040
Scott: And this guy is serious.

1390
01:11:51,201 --> 01:11:52,331
Rym: This guy is.

1391
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:53,440
Scott: He believes this one hundred percent.

1392
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:54,123
Scott: He's not trolling.

1393
01:11:54,605 --> 01:12:00,176
Scott: There is no way that he does not believe this is a one hundred percent legitimate for real Webcomic.

1394
01:12:01,221 --> 01:12:05,280
Scott: So, yeah, Billy the heretic sure is heretical, that's for sure.

1395
01:12:06,102 --> 01:12:06,283
Rym: All right.

1396
01:12:06,303 --> 01:12:09,660
Rym: Let's blow through the rest of these, because I think we have a winner.

1397
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:10,946
Scott: Yeah, we still got to go through all of them.

1398
01:12:10,986 --> 01:12:13,280
Rym: We do spicy tornado.

1399
01:12:13,681 --> 01:12:16,092
Scott: So the deal with spicy tornado, right, is.

1400
01:12:16,173 --> 01:12:20,160
Scott: I looked into this and it was submitted mostly because of the meta around this comic.

1401
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:20,562
Scott: Right.

1402
01:12:20,984 --> 01:12:25,859
Scott: So you look at it and it's basically sort of cute, simple ish M.S.

1403
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:30,220
Scott: Paint comics that are not really funny at all.

1404
01:12:31,143 --> 01:12:32,840
Scott: It's like, you know, it's going somewhere.

1405
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:38,947
Scott: It's almost like actually the one with the sperm and the shopping cart in the car, the golf cart.

1406
01:12:39,048 --> 01:12:40,040
Rym: And that's actually pretty good.

1407
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:40,706
Scott: That was all right.

1408
01:12:40,908 --> 01:12:41,899
Scott: It's got a good joke, at least.

1409
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:42,421
Scott: Right.

1410
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:50,960
Scott: You know, it's like this guy is going somewhere with his simple joke telling slightly, you know, as he's like a kid who can tell a good joke once in a while.

1411
01:12:51,460 --> 01:13:02,200
Scott: What's sad about this is that in the meta I read about this, this guy like quit his job to do this comic, thinking he's going to make a bunch of money.

1412
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:08,380
Scott: Basically, the kid or whoever made this comic or is making this comic, you know, it's like my mom told me it was great.

1413
01:13:08,481 --> 01:13:10,659
Scott: And it's like I'm thinking is the guy who is making this.

1414
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:15,400
Scott: It must be like the dude bro guy who is playing Imagine Babies fashion.

1415
01:13:15,561 --> 01:13:20,480
Scott: Like it's just someone who is so naive, you know, and so unworldly.

1416
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:21,750
Scott: Maybe his home school.

1417
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:22,438
Scott: I don't even know.

1418
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:23,061
Scott: Right.

1419
01:13:23,141 --> 01:13:28,879
Scott: Just someone who has no idea about the world and like, you know, thinks my mom says my comic is great.

1420
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,060
Scott: It's the best comic ever was.

1421
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,459
Scott: Like, have you seen another webcomic?

1422
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:34,300
Rym: I actually did not know any of that.

1423
01:13:34,581 --> 01:13:35,857
Scott: That was what was in the submission.

1424
01:13:35,918 --> 01:13:36,060
Scott: Right.

1425
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,129
Scott: So the submission was like.

1426
01:13:37,169 --> 01:13:38,440
Rym: I didn't read this mission on this one.

1427
01:13:39,001 --> 01:13:42,860
Scott: The submission says it received a lot of very strong criticism at face punch.

1428
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,260
Scott: Decided to sign him sign up himself and ask what was wrong with it.

1429
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:47,920
Scott: He left plenty of pearlers there.

1430
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,057
Scott: The fun begins here.

1431
01:13:49,761 --> 01:13:50,928
Scott: Right.

1432
01:13:51,412 --> 01:13:52,720
Scott: His posts speak for themselves.

1433
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,460
Scott: Learn about the man behind the comic is tragically hilarious and frankly, an important part of this mission.

1434
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,122
Scott: Right.

1435
01:13:59,689 --> 01:14:00,660
Scott: And there's not a lot of strips.

1436
01:14:00,781 --> 01:14:01,425
Scott: I looked at them all.

1437
01:14:01,445 --> 01:14:03,460
Scott: I didn't actually read every word of every one of them.

1438
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,022
Scott: But it's like.

1439
01:14:04,364 --> 01:14:13,231
Scott: basically the reason the comic this was submitted is the worst is because it's just so sad that the guy making it might maybe he's like even as down syndrome or something.

1440
01:14:13,252 --> 01:14:13,738
Scott: I don't even know.

1441
01:14:14,301 --> 01:14:19,643
Scott: You know, but it's like just the guy making it is so sad that like he's it's like imagine if.

1442
01:14:19,864 --> 01:14:24,460
Rym: But see, I can't make this one win because I know I don't think it's actually the worst.

1443
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:25,627
Rym: No, it's just sad.

1444
01:14:25,868 --> 01:14:27,700
Rym: But that's the meta is sad.

1445
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:28,591
Scott: It's not bad.

1446
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:29,239
Scott: It's just sad.

1447
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,925
Rym: Sad, bad man.

1448
01:14:30,965 --> 01:14:37,280
Rym: You know, that's why I couldn't if I picked a winner here that made by Brad, I'm not getting me sad to think about.

1449
01:14:37,441 --> 01:14:38,659
Rym: That makes me a bad person.

1450
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:39,243
Scott: Right.

1451
01:14:39,283 --> 01:14:42,000
Scott: It's got to make me mad or perhaps glad.

1452
01:14:42,181 --> 01:14:43,166
Scott: The comic's not bad.

1453
01:14:43,226 --> 01:14:48,392
Scott: Just the meta of it is a sad story of someone who believe like quit their job and believes they're going to make money with.

1454
01:14:48,935 --> 01:14:52,040
Scott: really not anywhere even close to you can make money.

1455
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:55,020
Rym: Scott, if you like, if we quit our jobs and make GeekNights full time.

1456
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,700
Scott: Yeah, but GeekNights is better than this comic.

1457
01:14:57,022 --> 01:14:58,360
Rym: Yeah, but we still wouldn't make enough money.

1458
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,480
Scott: That's for fucking sure.

1459
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:01,519
Scott: All right, let's move on.

1460
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:05,080
Rym: So station three station V three.

1461
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,660
Scott: Oh, this is the one like the cute little buddy guys.

1462
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:08,021
Scott: Right.

1463
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:10,673
Scott: So it's the thing that really bothered me about this.

1464
01:15:10,854 --> 01:15:16,947
Scott: one is it's been going on for a while and I read the beginning and the end and not so much of the middle is the other one.

1465
01:15:17,108 --> 01:15:18,500
Rym: I have no idea what if there's a plot.

1466
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:22,279
Scott: And it seems like if there is a plot, there's been no progression of it.

1467
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:22,781
Scott: Right.

1468
01:15:23,042 --> 01:15:23,323
Scott: It's like.

1469
01:15:23,364 --> 01:15:26,400
Scott: it seems like there is a continuity, but it hasn't moved.

1470
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:29,740
Scott: It's like it's still mostly where it started, even though it's been a while.

1471
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:35,660
Rym: Well, it has story arcs in the classic old style of webcomics in a dropdown box.

1472
01:15:36,383 --> 01:15:37,978
Rym: And there's like 50 of them.

1473
01:15:39,321 --> 01:15:59,639
Scott: Yeah, but you read them and it's like each story, it must be so decompressed, as they say, as to where you pass over like a minute of time in comic time in each story arc, and also you look at the art now in the beginning art and it's mostly the same, except he's using the bucket tool to color it, you know, it's like he hasn't changed the art except for coloring it with the bucket tool.

1474
01:16:00,821 --> 01:16:08,820
Scott: And so, I mean, in terms of improvement of art, I'd say this is the least improvement over time of any of them that had this stretch to cover.

1475
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:13,277
Rym: But again, it doesn't stand out as being particularly bad.

1476
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,379
Scott: No, I mean, some of the alien things are cute.

1477
01:16:17,742 --> 01:16:20,140
Scott: You know, like little things that buzz along the wall with two eyeballs.

1478
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,700
Rym: It's already more enjoyable than Garfield.

1479
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:29,440
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, nothing seems to really happen or tell any jokes, but already good jokes that make you have any humor.

1480
01:16:30,122 --> 01:16:32,520
Scott: But it's not the worst webcomic, not even close.

1481
01:16:32,662 --> 01:16:33,351
Rym: Just kind of goes on.

1482
01:16:33,392 --> 01:16:33,959
Rym: The little blobby guys.

1483
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:35,020
Scott: Billy the heretic is still winning.

1484
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,378
Rym: I kind of like the little blobby guys.

1485
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,126
Scott: Yeah, the blobby.

1486
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:38,080
Scott: I like anything blobby.

1487
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,235
Scott: That's that's going to hurt you if you tried to tell me something.

1488
01:16:40,255 --> 01:16:41,121
Scott: blobby is the worst.

1489
01:16:42,205 --> 01:16:45,700
Scott: A guy in his monkey dot com is a 404 GoDaddy squatting site.

1490
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:46,632
Scott: Good game.

1491
01:16:46,652 --> 01:16:46,856
Scott: Right.

1492
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:47,984
Scott: So there you go.

1493
01:16:48,768 --> 01:16:51,260
Scott: The next submission was chick.com, which is ChickTracks.

1494
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:53,240
Rym: But they are technically online.

1495
01:16:53,783 --> 01:16:54,759
Scott: Making them webcomics.

1496
01:16:55,420 --> 01:17:01,500
Rym: The website for Chick looks surprisingly at first glance, not nearly as crazy as you'd expect.

1497
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:05,680
Scott: No, it's like it's a. it's basically a cookie cutter e-commerce site.

1498
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,978
Rym: He clearly paid someone for it.

1499
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:18,214
Scott: No, it looks like he downloaded or either downloaded or basically got a, you know, a roll your own e-commerce site using magenta or one or, you know, open cart or one of those thingies.

1500
01:17:18,882 --> 01:17:21,160
Scott: So e-commerce and made it site to sell ChickTracks.

1501
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:24,359
Rym: Here's the question, because the submitter even, you know, kind of addresses this.

1502
01:17:24,901 --> 01:17:30,220
Rym: Is it fair to put the ChickTracks in the same running because they're special?

1503
01:17:30,642 --> 01:17:34,466
Scott: Even if you put the ChickTracks in the same running, Billy, the heretic is still worse.

1504
01:17:34,996 --> 01:17:35,180
Rym: True.

1505
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,566
Rym: And I think the reason why is so.

1506
01:17:36,948 --> 01:17:39,380
Rym: when I read a ChickTrack, I usually laugh.

1507
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:40,083
Scott: Yeah.

1508
01:17:40,123 --> 01:17:40,264
Scott: Right.

1509
01:17:40,284 --> 01:17:42,940
Scott: Because it's like it's so wrong that it's laughable.

1510
01:17:43,501 --> 01:17:43,823
Scott: Right.

1511
01:17:43,943 --> 01:17:45,714
Scott: It's like it's like Time Cube.

1512
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:47,202
Scott: Right.

1513
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:51,162
Scott: If you take Time Cube as a joke and not as a serious thing, you know, in that way.

1514
01:17:51,383 --> 01:17:55,299
Scott: And it's like it has such a the meta of ChickTracks because everyone knows them.

1515
01:17:55,942 --> 01:17:56,828
Scott: It's like you can't.

1516
01:17:57,734 --> 01:17:58,519
Scott: you can't not.

1517
01:17:58,781 --> 01:18:04,209
Scott: Oh, it's actually really cheap to order the ChickTrack like that's why, you know, you see the crazy people handing them out.

1518
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:05,840
Scott: because they can get them for almost nothing.

1519
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:06,763
Rym: We should make some.

1520
01:18:07,407 --> 01:18:09,236
Rym: I know people have made nerdy ChickTracks before.

1521
01:18:09,277 --> 01:18:10,958
Rym: we should make our own and just put them out there.

1522
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:11,909
Scott: People have done that.

1523
01:18:11,929 --> 01:18:12,153
Rym: All right.

1524
01:18:12,194 --> 01:18:12,479
Rym: Ponies.

1525
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:13,322
Scott: Sure.

1526
01:18:13,988 --> 01:18:15,079
Scott: Control delete was submitted again.

1527
01:18:16,023 --> 01:18:17,440
Scott: Now here comes something special.

1528
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:19,660
Scott: This is maybe the best submission there was.

1529
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,439
Rym: I was I was surprised by this when I was going through and I actually looked at it.

1530
01:18:23,721 --> 01:18:29,860
Scott: Someone made a comic called GeekNights Comic One or GeekNights' Comic One.

1531
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:32,220
Scott: Yeah, it's a comic about us straight up.

1532
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,618
Scott: It's all inside jokes you'll only get if you listen to GeekNights or go to the forum.

1533
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:42,557
Rym: It's made by taking our Creative Commons licensed videos and pictures of us and putting speech bubbles on them.

1534
01:18:43,102 --> 01:18:44,780
Scott: It's they're actually really funny.

1535
01:18:45,143 --> 01:18:46,900
Scott: If you know us, they're not funny at all.

1536
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:51,449
Rym: If you don't know what is really interesting to me and why I want we're going to have a new contest now.

1537
01:18:51,489 --> 01:18:52,239
Rym: This inspired me.

1538
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:56,641
Scott: And the newest issue, the comic, though, was just made with sticks and didn't use photos of us.

1539
01:18:56,661 --> 01:18:58,991
Rym: Dude, whoever is making this, I didn't really look.

1540
01:18:59,373 --> 01:19:01,141
Rym: make more because I kind of like it.

1541
01:19:01,442 --> 01:19:02,166
Scott: I also like it.

1542
01:19:02,226 --> 01:19:05,724
Scott: Keep making it, but not just because it is ego stroking because legitimately funny.

1543
01:19:05,764 --> 01:19:11,460
Rym: What I find really interesting, though, is that reading something like this, they're funny to us.

1544
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:18,320
Rym: But yet you the listeners out there, you don't know, you know, the real Rym and the real Scott, you know, the kind of persona we put on on GeekNights.

1545
01:19:18,822 --> 01:19:26,260
Rym: Our friends often laugh when you about certain, I don't know, things you believe about the two of us that are very far off the mark.

1546
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:31,560
Rym: But as far as our persona, personas on GeekNights are, that's how we are like the meet.

1547
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,798
Rym: the US, you know, is not the US we really are.

1548
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:35,960
Rym: But the US, you know, is actually kind of funny.

1549
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:36,742
Rym: Yeah.

1550
01:19:36,762 --> 01:19:41,525
Scott: There's also a double meta in, I think, the third comic where it's like, here, let me read this to you.

1551
01:19:41,545 --> 01:19:43,539
Scott: So here, let let you have it open.

1552
01:19:44,221 --> 01:19:47,059
Rym: Yes, I have the third one, the one that's you want to read our parts.

1553
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,459
Rym: Yes, the lettering is really bad.

1554
01:19:50,122 --> 01:19:52,660
Scott: So I'll start because I'm the one for talking first.

1555
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,739
Scott: So, you know, we're in this webcomic, right?

1556
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,980
Rym: The wine helps me forget, but I'm not there yet.

1557
01:19:59,180 --> 01:19:59,924
Rym: Why do you ask?

1558
01:20:00,346 --> 01:20:03,527
Scott: Do you think it was created just to be an entry in the worst webcomic contest?

1559
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:04,439
Rym: I expect so.

1560
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,738
Rym: It's certainly a bad webcomic.

1561
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:06,583
Rym: Come on, dude.

1562
01:20:06,603 --> 01:20:11,700
Rym: When we said we should feel bad about not creating anything, we didn't mean you should make shit just to feel good about yourself.

1563
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:12,744
Rym: Put some effort into it.

1564
01:20:13,588 --> 01:20:16,585
Scott: And then the narrator says, all right, how about some of those adventures?

1565
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:17,110
Scott: I promised.

1566
01:20:17,151 --> 01:20:17,919
Scott: Who do you want to meet?

1567
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,240
Scott: Then I say Rainbow Dash.

1568
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,478
Rym: How about Kellis?

1569
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:25,839
Rym: Can you get us a character from a book or do you not read at all?

1570
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:29,259
Scott: Narrator says those are not public domain.

1571
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,618
Rym: Creative Commons, you mean?

1572
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:34,360
Scott: Narrator says the point is I can't draw them in this comic.

1573
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:35,980
Rym: You actually just can't draw.

1574
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:36,786
Rym: Full stop.

1575
01:20:37,048 --> 01:20:38,420
Rym: That's true.

1576
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,242
Scott: I don't know.

1577
01:20:39,282 --> 01:20:41,440
Rym: They made good use of our facial expression.

1578
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:44,034
Scott: This is probably the best webcomic you can make with Riven.

1579
01:20:44,054 --> 01:20:45,020
Scott: Scott is characters.

1580
01:20:45,162 --> 01:20:45,973
Scott: And I salute you.

1581
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:46,399
Scott: Good job.

1582
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:47,004
Scott: Keep it up.

1583
01:20:47,146 --> 01:20:48,199
Rym: Keep it up in a big way.

1584
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:49,387
Scott: Yeah, you're a winner.

1585
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:50,679
Scott: And you made something.

1586
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:51,504
Rym: Whoo.

1587
01:20:52,983 --> 01:20:53,939
Rym: Oh, you skipped one.

1588
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:54,909
Scott: Did I?

1589
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,879
Scott: The control delete, we mentioned it.

1590
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:58,409
Rym: Yeah, we did.

1591
01:20:58,429 --> 01:20:58,779
Rym: Never mind.

1592
01:20:59,582 --> 01:21:01,619
Scott: We're mentioning them all twice because you keep going back into them.

1593
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:04,860
Scott: Divide the number of times you mentioned control delete by half.

1594
01:21:06,202 --> 01:21:13,780
Scott: So the next submission, someone linked to spreadsheets at Google dot com and it was like, hey, share the spreadsheet of submissions of the worst webcomic.

1595
01:21:13,841 --> 01:21:14,533
Scott: No, no.

1596
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:18,640
Scott: The next one is actually another control delete because.

1597
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:19,343
Rym: But because.

1598
01:21:19,383 --> 01:21:22,020
Rym: But I think at this point people were just taking the piss.

1599
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:22,481
Scott: Yes.

1600
01:21:22,846 --> 01:21:23,635
Scott: OK, the next one, M.G.

1601
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,260
Scott: Comics, Akuma something.

1602
01:21:26,842 --> 01:21:31,043
Rym: So according to the submission, it's one of the, quote, shittiest sprite comics he's ever read.

1603
01:21:31,566 --> 01:21:36,120
Rym: But apparently it's held up as one of the best sonic sprite comics in existence.

1604
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:45,480
Rym: Now, one, the fact that you would have a category for best sprite comics and inside of that, you have a category for best sonic sprite comics.

1605
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:49,839
Rym: And related to that, you know that this is held up as the best of those.

1606
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:50,474
Scott: Yeah.

1607
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:52,258
Rym: Sprite comics suck.

1608
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,780
Scott: All of them basically except 8-bit theater.

1609
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:56,060
Scott: Yeah.

1610
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,014
Scott: This comic is basically, you know, it's about.

1611
01:21:59,175 --> 01:22:00,923
Scott: it's less than Bob and George, I would say.

1612
01:22:01,324 --> 01:22:06,018
Scott: But it's for sonic fans, basically, you know, and that's all there is to it.

1613
01:22:06,945 --> 01:22:07,838
Scott: It's pretty awful.

1614
01:22:08,442 --> 01:22:15,400
Scott: Which, you know, the thing that makes it really awful is that even worse than Bob and George is it's hard to read just because everything is so small.

1615
01:22:15,962 --> 01:22:18,600
Scott: It's like the guy didn't doesn't format the comic properly.

1616
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,200
Scott: So you can't even read the letters in there.

1617
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,354
Scott: It's like you need a magnifying glass and some of these strips.

1618
01:22:23,796 --> 01:22:28,499
Scott: in some of them you can read, but some of them it's like you need a magnifying glass to know what's going on in this comic.

1619
01:22:30,061 --> 01:22:37,180
Scott: And it's just, you know, it's basically a mediocre sonic fanfic with sprites.

1620
01:22:37,942 --> 01:22:39,399
Scott: Instead of just being a fanfic.

1621
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:40,776
Scott: That's it.

1622
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:41,481
Rym: Yeah.

1623
01:22:41,661 --> 01:22:46,344
Rym: So, again, meh, but not bad, bad, not worse.

1624
01:22:46,384 --> 01:22:48,138
Scott: I give it one bad, not two bads.

1625
01:22:49,121 --> 01:22:49,646
Scott: OK.

1626
01:22:49,747 --> 01:22:51,040
Scott: Another submission for Control Delete.

1627
01:22:51,742 --> 01:22:53,879
Rym: It's a comic about computer aided design, I think.

1628
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:57,399
Scott: Another submission of the GeekNights comic that featured us.

1629
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:57,801
Rym: Yep.

1630
01:22:57,882 --> 01:22:58,347
Rym: Sorry, dude.

1631
01:22:58,387 --> 01:22:59,438
Rym: Someone already submitted it.

1632
01:22:59,861 --> 01:23:01,139
Scott: Another submission of Control Delete.

1633
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:02,243
Rym: Awesome.

1634
01:23:02,304 --> 01:23:05,159
Rym: And then one that we didn't see until just now.

1635
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:08,959
Scott: It was submitted yesterday, so I didn't see it until just now.

1636
01:23:09,661 --> 01:23:12,620
Rym: So I'm not sure what to make of this one because it's pretty bad.

1637
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,960
Rym: But Billy the Heretic really beat you to the punch.

1638
01:23:16,101 --> 01:23:17,180
Rym: Whoever made this comic.

1639
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:17,660
Scott: Yeah.

1640
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:23,559
Scott: I mean, this comic obviously was submitted because it's extreme Fox News, right wingish kind of thing.

1641
01:23:24,181 --> 01:23:24,382
Scott: Right.

1642
01:23:24,524 --> 01:23:26,478
Scott: So whoever submitted it really disagreed with it.

1643
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,020
Rym: Bad political views alone do not a bad webcomic make.

1644
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,260
Rym: You could probably make a really good right wing comic, though I've never seen one.

1645
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:40,008
Scott: But I mean, you know, like the ones that actually are more are less right wingish, but still right wing.

1646
01:23:40,028 --> 01:23:41,280
Scott: But make it to the newspaper.

1647
01:23:41,744 --> 01:23:42,899
Scott: Like what's the one with the duck?

1648
01:23:43,444 --> 01:23:44,234
Rym: Oh, Mallard.

1649
01:23:44,275 --> 01:23:44,640
Rym: What's it?

1650
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:45,365
Rym: It's terrible.

1651
01:23:45,546 --> 01:23:47,119
Scott: It's terrible, but it's not as bad as this.

1652
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:47,422
Scott: No.

1653
01:23:47,704 --> 01:23:47,966
Scott: Right.

1654
01:23:48,027 --> 01:23:49,680
Rym: You know, that's why that's in the newspaper.

1655
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,593
Rym: And this isn't right.

1656
01:23:50,654 --> 01:23:51,040
Scott: Exactly.

1657
01:23:51,160 --> 01:24:00,980
Rym: So anyway, to quote the submitter, it's a horrible and racist and sexist and all that, especially with its super hot, comically huge boob, half Asian, half Swedish token game girl.

1658
01:24:01,383 --> 01:24:03,740
Rym: Oh, and she's a virgin and conservative.

1659
01:24:06,014 --> 01:24:06,218
Scott: Yeah.

1660
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:06,300
Scott: OK.

1661
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:08,740
Rym: And they call Obama a Nazi or something.

1662
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:09,882
Scott: They probably do.

1663
01:24:11,408 --> 01:24:14,440
Rym: There is apparently some some more author drama, though.

1664
01:24:15,242 --> 01:24:18,860
Rym: OK, so according to the submitter, I did not verify this at all.

1665
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:25,660
Rym: The webcomic author claimed that he was in foreclosure because of, quote, liberal banks.

1666
01:24:25,721 --> 01:24:26,731
Rym: that forced him to take a loan.

1667
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:27,559
Rym: he couldn't afford to pay.

1668
01:24:28,242 --> 01:24:30,119
Rym: So he raised money, forced him to take a loan.

1669
01:24:30,422 --> 01:24:30,846
Rym: I don't know.

1670
01:24:30,866 --> 01:24:31,652
Rym: So he raised money.

1671
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:33,839
Scott: Whatever your right wing.

1672
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:36,040
Scott: What happened to a personal responsibility?

1673
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,100
Rym: Oh, but he was forced to buy the evil liberals.

1674
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:38,662
Scott: Sure.

1675
01:24:39,063 --> 01:24:45,419
Rym: So he apparently attempted to raise money from his fans, raise some money and then lost it in a Ponzi scheme.

1676
01:24:47,605 --> 01:24:49,880
Rym: I don't know, I read through it and it wasn't.

1677
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,240
Rym: Offensive is so much is just, again, immemorable.

1678
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:57,154
Scott: There's offensive stuff like, did you see the one with the?

1679
01:24:57,194 --> 01:25:00,275
Scott: he's got a Chinese guy with huge buck teeth and you know, like on purpose.

1680
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:00,778
Rym: there it is.

1681
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:01,569
Scott: Yeah.

1682
01:25:01,815 --> 01:25:01,999
Rym: Wow.

1683
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,455
Rym: The word faggots actually coming up a lot now that I'm going through.

1684
01:25:04,495 --> 01:25:06,480
Scott: these are the guy he's pretty just blatantly right.

1685
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,280
Scott: I mean, here is the one that's like fascism.

1686
01:25:08,401 --> 01:25:09,049
Scott: You can believe it.

1687
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:10,080
Scott: It's got Obama's face.

1688
01:25:10,662 --> 01:25:13,199
Rym: Oh, I must have picked the wrong random ones to read.

1689
01:25:13,662 --> 01:25:14,540
Rym: This is way more.

1690
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,299
Rym: OK, I was reading like these bible ones that were just kind of.

1691
01:25:17,964 --> 01:25:18,329
Scott: Yeah, they're.

1692
01:25:18,369 --> 01:25:19,120
Scott: no, they're bible ones.

1693
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:19,805
Scott: There's all kinds.

1694
01:25:19,845 --> 01:25:21,680
Scott: It's like it's comic strip club, right?

1695
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,485
Scott: It's like a club.

1696
01:25:22,827 --> 01:25:23,974
Scott: There's a bunch of different comics.

1697
01:25:24,054 --> 01:25:24,718
Scott: is red eye.

1698
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:27,039
Scott: Name this strip evolve with guy.

1699
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:34,520
Rym: There's also the the with Mika and fascist Obama rip off of the Republicans and the Democrat with the same art.

1700
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:35,183
Rym: Right.

1701
01:25:35,203 --> 01:25:38,867
Scott: But the thing is, actually, the art in this is one hundred times better than Billy the heretic.

1702
01:25:39,069 --> 01:25:40,180
Rym: A hundred thousand.

1703
01:25:40,821 --> 01:25:41,403
Scott: Right.

1704
01:25:42,065 --> 01:25:47,340
Scott: Even though it's crazy right wing, it's just Fox News right wing and not Billy the heretic right wing.

1705
01:25:47,744 --> 01:25:49,280
Scott: It's not like kill all the Jews.

1706
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:51,879
Scott: He's actually saying Obama's a Nazi, like it's a bad thing.

1707
01:25:52,521 --> 01:25:54,860
Scott: I always find that funny, like you will act like Obama's a Nazi.

1708
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:55,791
Scott: That's a bad thing.

1709
01:25:55,831 --> 01:25:56,398
Scott: that he's a Nazi.

1710
01:25:56,863 --> 01:25:58,939
Scott: But you also you're the one who hates the Jews.

1711
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,069
Scott: So what's your right.

1712
01:26:02,162 --> 01:26:04,212
Rym: I have a feeling that the billy the heretic guy has.

1713
01:26:04,272 --> 01:26:07,180
Scott: it's like they hate Jews and then they use Nazi as an insult.

1714
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,356
Scott: It's like what it's like.

1715
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:11,124
Scott: Are you kidding me?

1716
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:20,840
Rym: Well, I love the fact that they usually can Nazi, Nazism, screw the black people, fascism, the Nazis, kill the Nazis and racism, sexism and somehow socialism.

1717
01:26:21,561 --> 01:26:23,199
Rym: Like all those things are somehow.

1718
01:26:23,421 --> 01:26:26,360
Scott: Yeah, it's like you don't like socialism or fascism.

1719
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:27,467
Scott: But wait a minute.

1720
01:26:27,548 --> 01:26:28,779
Rym: Wait a minute.

1721
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:29,462
Scott: Wait a minute.

1722
01:26:30,668 --> 01:26:32,820
Scott: It's people like don't know what the words mean clearly.

1723
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:34,402
Scott: Anyway.

1724
01:26:34,482 --> 01:26:34,683
Scott: Yeah.

1725
01:26:34,804 --> 01:26:39,197
Scott: This is you know, if you're a leftist person, this is going to be incredibly offensive to you.

1726
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:43,860
Scott: But it's but it's not the worst webcomic because it's again, mediocre, immemorable.

1727
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:44,583
Rym: I'm going to forget.

1728
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:58,062
Scott: I think a significant number of these entries people just put in because, you know, they personally had a strong disagreement with the views of the author, which is, you know, as you can see in Billy the Heretic, a significant contributing factor.

1729
01:26:58,784 --> 01:27:09,365
Scott: But it's like the rest of the comic, if you would just change the views, if you took this comic strip club and you made it, you know, not about politics, you made it about video games.

1730
01:27:09,606 --> 01:27:12,219
Scott: And instead of hating blacks, they hated platformers.

1731
01:27:12,681 --> 01:27:18,264
Scott: And instead of, you know, hating Obama, they hated FPSs and they really like PlayStation.

1732
01:27:18,445 --> 01:27:21,660
Scott: It's like this would be an average mediocre webcomic.

1733
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:22,778
Scott: It wouldn't be, you know.

1734
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:29,361
Scott: So of all the submissions, that's all the submissions, how many controlled deletes do we have?

1735
01:27:29,821 --> 01:27:44,570
Scott: Oh, one, one, two, three, four, five, six, six, six submissions of controlled delete out of 30 submissions.

1736
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:48,370
Scott: So like a fifth of the submissions were controlled delete.

1737
01:27:48,911 --> 01:27:51,117
Scott: So you win the use.

1738
01:27:51,137 --> 01:28:01,970
Scott: the Voters Choice Award for worst webcomic, actual worst webcomic, I think is Billy the Heretic, because Billy the Heretic combines all of the aspects other than I don't think it was checked.

1739
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:05,288
Rym: No, it is not as pretends to be a fab comic, but isn't.

1740
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:05,913
Scott: That's right.

1741
01:28:05,953 --> 01:28:07,729
Rym: Pretends not to be a fab comic, but it is.

1742
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:10,810
Scott: It also was just in all of the qualities.

1743
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:11,969
Scott: How bad was the art?

1744
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,903
Rym: The art is awful.

1745
01:28:13,923 --> 01:28:14,750
Rym: The writing is awful.

1746
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:15,455
Scott: The worst.

1747
01:28:15,597 --> 01:28:16,508
Rym: The message awful.

1748
01:28:17,071 --> 01:28:18,470
Rym: The author crazy.

1749
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:21,650
Scott: Yeah, everything in all those other categories.

1750
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:24,669
Scott: It was off the charts in terms of how bad it was.

1751
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:29,010
Scott: Maximum craziness, maximum bad art, maximum badness.

1752
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:31,410
Rym: Billy the Heretic is kind of like the real world.

1753
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:35,810
Rym: Like a lot of these comics are like a generic schlubby guy that you pass on the street.

1754
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:36,588
Rym: You don't even notice him.

1755
01:28:36,992 --> 01:28:39,910
Rym: Some of them were like awesome celebrities walking by.

1756
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:41,189
Rym: And I don't know why you guys didn't like them.

1757
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:48,288
Rym: But Billy the Heretic is the smelly, angry hobo who physically accosts you when you try to walk by him.

1758
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:49,053
Scott: That's right.

1759
01:28:49,415 --> 01:28:52,070
Scott: And that is why it is the worst of webcomics.

1760
01:28:53,011 --> 01:28:56,170
Rym: So I guess we have our winner who submitted this one.

1761
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:57,509
Rym: Who did submit Billy the Heretic?

1762
01:28:59,051 --> 01:29:00,470
Scott: Chance, you win something.

1763
01:29:00,771 --> 01:29:01,790
Rym: We'll send you a prize.

1764
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:03,490
Rym: We will email you with details.

1765
01:29:03,790 --> 01:29:04,529
Scott: You can email us.

1766
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:06,530
Scott: Maybe let us know what kind of prize you want.

1767
01:29:08,773 --> 01:29:10,809
Rym: Yeah, you're welcome to read all these other webcomics.

1768
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:12,410
Scott: Yeah, put links to all the webcomics.

1769
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:14,769
Rym: I will put links to all the other webcomics.

1770
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:16,910
Scott: You only need to link control delete once, though.

1771
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:18,468
Rym: I got to link to it five times.

1772
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:20,309
Scott: But it was submitted six times.

1773
01:29:23,351 --> 01:29:28,556
Scott: And I don't know if you have any ideas for other worst contests we could do in this fashion.

1774
01:29:29,144 --> 01:29:29,610
Scott: Let us know.

1775
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:34,226
Rym: I feel like the worst podcast contest was more fun because I could just play examples in the show.

1776
01:29:34,893 --> 01:29:35,610
Scott: That is true.

1777
01:29:35,711 --> 01:29:38,110
Scott: We can't really show examples unless we did video.

1778
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:39,538
Rym: The contest I want to do.

1779
01:29:39,618 --> 01:29:41,350
Rym: next, I actually want to do something good.

1780
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:42,930
Rym: I want to have a mashup contest.

1781
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:43,871
Rym: All right.

1782
01:29:44,012 --> 01:29:44,716
Rym: Like some sort of like.

1783
01:29:44,776 --> 01:29:46,708
Rym: I haven't decided the rules yet, but I want to.

1784
01:29:46,909 --> 01:29:52,929
Rym: I want to get someone else in on it, like GeekNights, Front Row Crew and someone else that does creative stuff.

1785
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:56,594
Scott: The thing is, anytime we do a contest where people make stuff, we never get enough submissions.

1786
01:29:56,674 --> 01:29:56,775
Scott: Right.

1787
01:29:56,795 --> 01:29:59,774
Scott: We only got a handful of submissions of the GeekNights advertising contest.

1788
01:30:00,177 --> 01:30:02,010
Scott: We only got a handful of submissions of Cornucopia.

1789
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:10,869
Rym: That is why we want to involve two separate fan communities of things and say, mash up any combination of these two things.

1790
01:30:11,611 --> 01:30:11,652
Rym: OK.

1791
01:30:12,799 --> 01:30:14,350
Rym: That'll get at least double the submissions.

1792
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:15,152
Scott: We'll see.

1793
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:17,830
Rym: Maybe also in anime world order.

1794
01:30:19,232 --> 01:30:20,009
Scott: What are we going to mash up?

1795
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:24,110
Rym: I don't know, audio, video, I guess they don't have enough video.

1796
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:25,929
Rym: Yeah, they've got audio, though.

1797
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:26,993
Scott: We'll see.

1798
01:30:27,476 --> 01:30:29,670
Scott: You got to come up with a better idea than the vague idea.

1799
01:30:29,811 --> 01:30:30,429
Scott: You got a real idea.

1800
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:32,089
Rym: Yeah, I just want to get people to mash stuff up.

1801
01:30:32,871 --> 01:30:34,410
Rym: And I refuse to do a pony contest.

1802
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:35,175
Rym: Don't even ask.

1803
01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:36,889
Scott: The pony contest has already been won.

1804
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:39,231
Rym: Yay.

1805
01:30:45,798 --> 01:30:47,940
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1806
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:53,080
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1807
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:58,480
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1808
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:06,160
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1809
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:09,676
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1810
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,960
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1811
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,100
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
