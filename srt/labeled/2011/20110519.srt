1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,748
Rym: It's Thursday, April 19th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:12,389
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:13,011
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:14,234
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:20,824
Rym: Tonight, we talk about asses and Mars and reactors Quaid.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,492
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:32,756
Rym: I Swear this has nothing to do with all this sudden news about Arnold having a kid.

8
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:33,780
Scott: It's a nice coincidence.

9
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,165
Rym: Yeah, we just happen to.

10
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:42,300
Rym: you know many people in our crew had never seen Total Recall and Why are you skipping in the second half of the show right away?

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,260
Rym: It's one of those movies that everyone's seen so we made sure everyone saw it.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,520
Rym: But the reason I bring it up early is that I didn't care at all about this whole.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,512
Rym: You know Arnold had a kid and he was paying child support.

14
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:52,397
Rym: I don't care either.

15
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:55,106
Rym: So I Happened to see a picture of the kid.

16
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:56,692
Rym: All right, and you know, what's great.

17
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:57,616
Scott: Is he gigantic?

18
00:00:57,656 --> 00:01:10,100
Rym: The kid looks Exactly like Arnold like not even like a little like Arnold but like it's Arnold Baby Arnold like there is no doubt to the paternity of this child.

19
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:17,273
Rym: Yeah, so in much more happy news it was sunny today.

20
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:18,878
Rym: Rainbow Dash finally did her job.

21
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:21,690
Rym: not really I was sunny most of the day.

22
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,940
Scott: Have you looked out the window like right this second?

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,698
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,008
Rym: I had a nice lunch at Bryan Park Sun was out.

25
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,171
Rym: the white stones of the library were gleaming so hard I can hardly look at him.

26
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:36,800
Rym: the library I got a go-to in about a day and because it was raining in the morning hardly anyone was in the park.

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,046
Rym: So it was just fantastic.

28
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:38,709
Rym: Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:40,920
Rym: And there were signs all over the park.

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,983
Rym: You know what those signs said?

31
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:45,251
Scott: don't go on the grass smell the flowers not the smoke.

32
00:01:45,632 --> 00:01:46,975
Rym: all smoking banned May 23rd.

33
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:52,969
Scott: Oh Yeah We still guys not yet May 23rd yet though.

34
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,434
Scott: Yeah, we got a few more days.

35
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:55,157
Scott: It's not gonna happen.

36
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:56,140
Scott: That's post apocalypse.

37
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:57,346
Scott: We're never gonna see.

38
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:05,950
Scott: Oh, right the non-smoking bark I Mean and no one will smoke tobacco in the park instead.

39
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,455
Scott: There'll be brimstone smell.

40
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:10,286
Scott: I Actually like the smell of brimstone.

41
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:13,439
Rym: So you'd better listen to GeekNights pretty soon because this is pretty much it.

42
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:20,683
Scott: Yeah, if you if you wanted to listen to some old episodes Maybe we should.

43
00:02:20,763 --> 00:02:24,236
Scott: maybe we should you know, stop being nice after the apocalypse.

44
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,480
Scott: It's gotta end sometime, right?

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,927
Scott: We can't do it when we're 90 years old.

46
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,699
Scott: We I think we could especially since when I'm 90 you'll be dead.

47
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:33,051
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to win the game of who lives the longest.

48
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:34,960
Rym: I'm pretty sure I'm gonna win that game.

49
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:36,049
Scott: I'm winning that game.

50
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:37,340
Rym: I'll bet you all my money.

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,001
Scott: That is the game that we've been playing since we were born and will not end for hopefully a long time, you know Tomorrow?

52
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:46,930
Rym: supposedly Thomas Jefferson and John Adams played the same game.

53
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:47,733
Scott: They did.

54
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:48,154
Scott: who won?

55
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:49,458
Rym: it was close.

56
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,083
Rym: suppose It was real close.

57
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:55,515
Rym: Jefferson died first, but Adam died saying Jefferson still lives.

58
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,580
Scott: Yeah, that's the story that I've heard as well.

59
00:02:58,624 --> 00:02:59,108
Scott: True it is.

60
00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:00,600
Scott: we'd have to ask this story, but you know what?

61
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,269
Rym: You know what?

62
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:03,305
Scott: That would be awesome If the same exact thing happened, huh?

63
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:07,137
Scott: Well, I'm dying and I'm like that bastard Rym still is.

64
00:03:07,197 --> 00:03:08,060
Scott: meanwhile Rym is dead.

65
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:15,962
Rym: Well, I'm pretty sure that Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were exactly as they were portrayed in 1776.

66
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,709
Scott: I think they disagreed more than we do though.

67
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:25,440
Scott: Yeah, we agree on a lot of fundamental Fundamentally disagree on a lot of things but they'd fundamentally disagreed on everything.

68
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,800
Scott: They were like opposite opinion on ever write down the the whole not are both pretty keen on democracy.

69
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:33,033
Scott: They were pretty keen on alcohol.

70
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:39,494
Rym: Yeah and ladies And wait none so much as Benjamin Franklin.

71
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:40,780
Scott: Well, you know, he was the man.

72
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,689
Rym: I mean, why else would you go to New Brunswick?

73
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:43,553
Rym: They were professionals.

74
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:44,959
Scott: Ben Franklin was the master.

75
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:49,707
Rym: So you got any news.

76
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:51,334
Rym: it's Thursday, it's the lounge.

77
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:53,305
Scott: it's whatever your lounge This is.

78
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:53,989
Scott: this isn't really.

79
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,184
Scott: it's normally would be a thing of the day But I'll make it news.

80
00:03:56,245 --> 00:04:02,059
Scott: Anyway, because it's not really anything in the day format So you remember the original got milk commercial?

81
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,360
Scott: Remember where the guy Right where the guys in the the restaurant or whatever?

82
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,500
Rym: It's probably the only reason that anyone in America today knows who Alexander Hamilton or Aaron Burr.

83
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:16,868
Scott: I knew who they were before the career.

84
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:21,147
Scott: Yeah, I don't think anyone else did maybe but anyway My co-worker actually never saw the commercial.

85
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,715
Scott: really one interesting piece of information.

86
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:29,706
Scott: side note this Commercial was directed by Michael Bay The explosion guy.

87
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:32,139
Scott: Wow, I know that I didn't either.

88
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:34,146
Scott: So here's the story.

89
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:35,009
Scott: some guy.

90
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,939
Scott: His name is left ventricle two years ago.

91
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:40,282
Rym: Okay Uploaded.

92
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:41,647
Scott: his YouTube name is left ventricle.

93
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:42,891
Scott: Okay, he uploaded.

94
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:47,289
Rym: I was wondering is I mean is ventricle the surname like Ventricle years ago.

95
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:52,369
Scott: He uploaded I think in oh eight That video of that commercial to YouTube.

96
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:55,919
Scott: it got many views many many views.

97
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,400
Scott: However, this guy left ventricle is his YouTube name.

98
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:03,898
Scott: Apparently has OCD and you know YouTube comments.

99
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:06,908
Rym: Did he take it down and put it back up?

100
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:09,014
Rym: No, does he respond to every comment?

101
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:10,860
Scott: No, he moderates all the comment.

102
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:21,650
Rym: Whoa has been doing so for years Whoa, so when I made my youtube account to put up the you know The way is GeekNights Rym if you want GeekNights stuff.

103
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:28,680
Rym: Yeah, I pretty much Looked at all the stuff I could do with comments and decided that would never be worth my time, right?

104
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,814
Scott: So what he does is like any comment.

105
00:05:31,854 --> 00:05:33,220
Scott: that's just like misspelled or whatever.

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,541
Scott: He actually deletes this guy's any and he got pissed off because there were like certain trends in commenting Like.

107
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:43,439
Scott: there are a whole bunch of people who would comment like spit out the sandwich dumbass and he would delete all those.

108
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:47,200
Scott: Or the be people who would point out facts like wait wait who?

109
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,420
Rym: Commenting to spit out the sandwich is like the old guy who yells at the screen in the movie theater.

110
00:05:54,424 --> 00:06:05,673
Scott: Right, but basically there are people who are posting like facts like, you know the actor, you know People would make a comment like oh the actor's name is Sean Whalen The DJ on the phone's name is Rob Paulson and director is Michael Bay.

111
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:11,382
Scott: and anyone who posts that information He deletes that too because he already has it in the description I'd like.

112
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,051
Scott: basically he's moderates this thing every day.

113
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:14,874
Rym: and what do you think?

114
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:16,780
Rym: We'd have to pay him to moderate our forum.

115
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:23,100
Rym: He's a completely obsessive nut and yeah, I really want him to moderate our right, but I would consider paying him.

116
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:26,997
Scott: But the point is is that it's like he's been doing this on this YouTube video.

117
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:29,640
Scott: where he could He could just turn off comments.

118
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,400
Rym: I want to invite him into the ivory tower.

119
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:40,810
Scott: but the point just gotta read the story of this guy because it's like an epic story of a guy who does not understand the Internet and has fallen victim to it and his own.

120
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,235
Rym: this is pretty disordered.

121
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:47,372
Rym: I mean this guy is basically It's the equivalent of correcting all the graffiti that you see.

122
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,780
Rym: not not removing the graffiti but correcting.

123
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,713
Scott: So the top two comments are number one with 78 thumbs ups.

124
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:56,869
Scott: Judging by the uploader comments in description.

125
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,519
Scott: the person who uploaded this is a massive control freak asshole.

126
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:04,213
Scott: Comment number two not 56 upvotes Michael Bay.

127
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:05,256
Scott: question mark then.

128
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:06,660
Scott: where the hell were all the explosions?

129
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:11,436
Scott: It seems unlikely that left ventricle will ever find peace.

130
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,023
Rym: So Very briefly.

131
00:07:14,043 --> 00:07:25,780
Rym: I probably will regret this but I do want to talk a little bit about President Barack Obama's recent speech about the Middle East because Many US presidents have given speeches and tried to do them.

132
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:27,724
Rym: Not every single one.

133
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:28,867
Scott: the top few decades.

134
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:33,260
Rym: Thomas Jefferson did not give any speeches about how we need to reconcile Israel and Palestine.

135
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,609
Scott: He cared about Tripoli just close.

136
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:43,878
Rym: Yeah So, you know Carter Wanted to have peace in the Middle East and pretty much every American president is wanted to have peace in the Middle East.

137
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:45,244
Rym: and we do Because you got it.

138
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:48,196
Scott: You can't just do nothing because stuff is happening and you're the president's.

139
00:07:48,578 --> 00:07:54,071
Rym: not just that It's because the United States plays a very vital role in Israel's foreign policy of

140
00:07:54,131 --> 00:08:05,800
Scott: course and you know You got to do something and I bet every single one of those presidents is thinking if I'm the guy who makes the big move And actually something good comes of it then I will be remembered forever as so great.

141
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:07,648
Scott: So they all try to do something.

142
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:10,040
Rym: pretty much every time this has come up.

143
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:27,300
Rym: the US is usually really heavily sided with Israel and for many reasons, but President Barack Obama might have grown another testicle because he Basically said that Israel needs to pull back to the 1967 borders and give up the West Bank and East Jerusalem anti-semite.

144
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:32,133
Rym: And I am so proud of him for going for this.

145
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:37,000
Rym: and now it's funny because you know We're doing some more hardcore panels at PAX this year.

146
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:46,878
Rym: So I bought three books on game theory All right, and they're through their three levels of difficulty and so far having read one and a half of them We got this shit not difficult enough.

147
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:47,883
Rym: yet We know this shit.

148
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,068
Rym: the math is the hard part.

149
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,960
Rym: so I flipped through the third book and the first two pages.

150
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,663
Rym: They're like, all right.

151
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:56,120
Rym: All right, the rest of the book is almost nothing but math.

152
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:58,164
Rym: We'll see.

153
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:01,219
Rym: we'll see I've been writing utility functions and they seem to work.

154
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:16,319
Rym: anyway, there's a Concept that we already know and we've already talked about this a lot on the show and in our lectures at Conventions like tax but it comes up very directly in this situation and it came up in the book I was just reading so it was fresh in my mind.

155
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:28,696
Rym: It's the idea that you can play an equilibrium strategy in a strategic game like foreign policy Which guarantees you a minimum return but also limits your maximum return, you know, assuming everyone's rational.

156
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:30,320
Rym: This is like your default strategy.

157
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,326
Rym: It's the equivalent of playing conservatively in hearts.

158
00:09:32,828 --> 00:09:38,006
Rym: Yep, if I play conservatively and the three people I'm playing with their dumbasses I'm pretty much guaranteed to win.

159
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,839
Rym: and if I play conservatively and everyone else is smart.

160
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,080
Scott: Someone's gonna shoot the moon eventually because they're either gonna play conservatively or shoot the moon.

161
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:56,379
Rym: but on average playing conservatively guarantees that you will not lose a game of hearts because odds are at least one person's a dumbass or Someone will make a mistake or the game will come down to use a complete randomness.

162
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:07,960
Rym: But the only way to break out of a perfect equilibrium where both sides are rational is to get into the poison cup Second-guessing game where you decide that you think the other person is going to be perfectly rational.

163
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,160
Rym: Therefore you act very irrationally and have a smaller chance of a bigger payout.

164
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:20,600
Rym: That's how to you know Because it's more interesting to play a game like hearts when you go over the fucking moon because otherwise you're guaranteeing yourself second place.

165
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:21,546
Rym: Who wants second place?

166
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:27,131
Scott: Yeah, you might risk falling way low But you get a chance of shooting the moon and going directly to first.

167
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:28,396
Scott: do not pass go now.

168
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:42,726
Rym: the book gave an interesting Example because I used to always give an example of this Situation in terms of paper rock scissors the idea that if you're playing paper rock scissors against a little kid You can pretty much assume they're gonna throw scissors Because kids try it sometime.

169
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,033
Rym: little kids feel like scissors is powerful.

170
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:47,420
Rym: They tend to throw scissors first almost always.

171
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:49,611
Scott: It's I remember doing that when I was a kid.

172
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:51,520
Rym: Yeah, and no kid, you know why you're kid?

173
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,770
Rym: You're not even like sentient yet cuz it made of metal.

174
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:55,719
Scott: It's like yeah cutting is cool.

175
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:57,824
Rym: It's the same way.

176
00:10:57,864 --> 00:11:01,620
Rym: in your little kid you got a coloring book and yours like yeah blue all over the fuck place.

177
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:04,753
Scott: It's like paper whatever papers boring rocks.

178
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:06,300
Scott: I have rocks in the backyard, but scissors.

179
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,677
Scott: I'm not even allowed to play with dangerous scissors as a dangerous weapon.

180
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:10,219
Scott: as a kid.

181
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:20,108
Rym: I read I recognize this and I thought all right if the if the kid I'm gonna play paper rock scissors with is a dumbass I know he's gonna throw Scissors so I'm gonna throw rock.

182
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:20,551
Scott: how about that?

183
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:21,013
Scott: Pete and Pete.

184
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:28,800
Rym: and then I would think about Someone who's one like degree removed from dumbass attitude like he's one level less of a dumbass.

185
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,612
Rym: I assume that he knows the same thing.

186
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:36,508
Rym: I know that the kids are gonna throw scissors So he assumes that I think he's gonna throw scissors.

187
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:40,117
Rym: So he throws rock to get rid of my scissors.

188
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:40,579
Scott: Mm-hmm.

189
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:50,540
Rym: So basically you can iterate through this repetitive mod 3 math Depending on what degree of intelligence you think the other person has relative to a five-year-old, right?

190
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,840
Scott: But the thing is if they have once they're at the fourth level of intelligence, you know, they're gonna pick randomly.

191
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:57,010
Rym: Ah, no, I don't think they will.

192
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:59,080
Rym: I think that you know, I'll pick randomly.

193
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:08,400
Rym: There's a modulus 3 that goes to infinity degrees of intelligence Unless they're smart enough to realize that playing randomly is the only way to get out of that.

194
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:16,180
Rym: But if you know, they're going to play randomly, you know that your best strategy is to also play randomly However, and you can't affect the outcome so it doesn't really matter.

195
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:23,720
Rym: But if you know if you think the other person is going to play randomly and they don't then everything moves around again.

196
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:25,125
Scott: Hey, let's do one right now.

197
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:25,567
Scott: Just one.

198
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:27,294
Scott: All right, one, two, three.

199
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,078
Scott: Are you scissors?

200
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:28,600
Rym: Are you scissors?

201
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:38,651
Rym: So The point of all this is that Barack who aren't any smart at all.

202
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,514
Scott: That's what that means, right?

203
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,856
Rym: or we're modulus 3.

204
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:52,488
Rym: So Barack Obama I think is bucking the trend of previous presidents who basically said yeah is real blah blah blah blah and he's basically taking The the more he's trying to shoot.

205
00:12:52,528 --> 00:13:06,479
Rym: he's trying to shoot the moon instead of not losing because Israel is gonna be like no Fuck you but you know what Palestine's chill with this and Much of the rest of the world is chill with this and it really shifts the onus of who's the bad guy.

206
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:12,719
Rym: even though They're both both good and bad guys a little bit more toward Israel I still don't have confidence that they will ever.

207
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:22,171
Rym: I do I think I will predict right now that in our lifetime you and me before we both die We will see a Palestinian state.

208
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:25,546
Scott: that doesn't mean that there will be peace and they'll stop fighting I don't know.

209
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:28,299
Scott: but there could be a state but there's still gonna be war and it's never gonna end.

210
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:35,344
Scott: I think it'll actually reduce quite a bit because having a pal and I'm saying it won't reduce or wax and wane with the times But it will never end.

211
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:36,669
Rym: that's that's stupid.

212
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,813
Rym: That's pointless.

213
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,600
Rym: That's like saying yeah, there will always be entropy.

214
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:44,275
Scott: Well, no, but always Scott there always be war in that particular spot.

215
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:45,640
Rym: There will always be dumbasses.

216
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:48,706
Rym: You can't eliminate the dumbass.

217
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,696
Scott: I think there will never be peace between Israel and Palestine.

218
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:53,080
Rym: I think there will be relative peace.

219
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:06,739
Rym: I think a Palestinian state two or three generations from the point where that happens just by pulling the rug out from under the semi-legitimacy of the groups that actually try to get people to be suicide bombers that rile the people up.

220
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,700
Rym: if There's if that like core legitimacy of yes, we need our own state is gone.

221
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:15,880
Rym: They can really only tap the craziest people and a few generations out.

222
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,839
Rym: I think the rate of violence will go the same route that the rate of violence in North Ireland did.

223
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:22,364
Scott: It's incredibly optimistic.

224
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:31,031
Rym: Look I know but again 50 years a lot can happen and I praise Barack Obama For shooting the motherfucking moon.

225
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:31,914
Scott: He didn't shoot the moon yet.

226
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:35,274
Scott: He's trying to shoot the moon, which is cool I think by saying this is his policy.

227
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:35,899
Rym: He shot the moon.

228
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:39,120
Scott: You don't know you actually have to shoot the moon.

229
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:42,479
Scott: I could try to shoot the moon all I want but as soon as you take the Queen that's it.

230
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:45,680
Rym: Well, the thing is there's nothing the US can do other than you know.

231
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,245
Rym: I guess if you cut all our aid to Israel we could force them to pull back to those I know I'm not saying it's a bad move.

232
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:52,028
Scott: It's actually.

233
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:53,252
Rym: that's not shooting the moon.

234
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:55,378
Rym: That's that's going all in.

235
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:55,880
Rym: and Euchre.

236
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,245
Scott: I'm not saying it's a bad move.

237
00:14:57,325 --> 00:14:57,626
Scott: I'm just.

238
00:14:57,707 --> 00:14:59,494
Scott: I have very little optimism.

239
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:00,517
Rym: That's going alone in Euchre.

240
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:02,086
Rym: He's not going alone He's just shooting the moon.

241
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:03,134
Scott: I don't think he's actually gonna.

242
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:03,899
Scott: he's gonna take a heart.

243
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,549
Scott: Ah You're gonna he's gonna.

244
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,016
Rym: ah, you know what I'm gonna make a crazy prediction.

245
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:21,786
Rym: All right, I think there will be a pseudo-palestinian state with some form of legitimized self-rule Within Barack Obama's second term.

246
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:26,587
Scott: if he has a second term, I guarantee you're also predicting a second term I'll bet you 500 bucks.

247
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:27,431
Rym: He gets a second time.

248
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:30,091
Scott: I'm pretty sure there'll be a second term also But you're not gonna bet against me.

249
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,084
Rym: I'm 99% You're wrong.

250
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,269
Rym: he's not gonna have a second term.

251
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:35,980
Rym: Oh really because the Raptors this fucking weekend.

252
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:44,339
Rym: Anyway, so I've one other thing I want to talk about because this actually kind of annoyed me.

253
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:46,819
Rym: It's just a news that I randomly stumbled upon.

254
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:56,266
Rym: United Airlines Apologized to a fat person to everybody everybody because they happen to have two flights flight 175 and flight 93 recently.

255
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:02,717
Rym: Okay, those happen to be the flight numbers of the flights that went down in the 9/11 attacks.

256
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:15,920
Rym: Okay, so so apparently enough people recognize that and were pissed off about it and had thought that the airline had retired the numbers because apparently Terrorist attacks are the same as hockey where you retire the jersey.

257
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:20,009
Rym: So they apologized and they have now retired.

258
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,740
Rym: those two numbers, okay, and I just find that incredibly stupid.

259
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:25,546
Scott: Agree that it is incredibly stupid.

260
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:26,228
Scott: I mean fucking.

261
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:32,449
Rym: I didn't forget that the September 11th attacks happened on September 11th But I had already forgotten the flight numbers.

262
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,234
Scott: and who cares.

263
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:34,300
Scott: It's just a fucking number.

264
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,847
Rym: The thing is I don't even know who cares.

265
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,580
Rym: It didn't state any particular person was angry.

266
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:44,315
Scott: The news article just said we apologize It was probably the press saw it and the press wanted to make a story.

267
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:45,459
Scott: a lot of these things are like that.

268
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:45,640
Scott: where?

269
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,562
Rym: Manufacture?

270
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,338
Rym: some outrage like yeah, they may not store.

271
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:52,055
Rym: recently There was a story about a woman who injected Botox in a little daughter's face.

272
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:52,678
Scott: Was that true?

273
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:57,800
Rym: No Well, but it basically it generated so much traffic.

274
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:01,567
Rym: There's a great industry in manufacturing outrage.

275
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:06,069
Rym: Yeah, I feel like we can export it To where we gonna export it to.

276
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,660
Scott: everybody's already has outrage.

277
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,449
Rym: Scandinavia doesn't have plenty of outrage.

278
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:12,954
Rym: I don't think they have a go.

279
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:14,500
Rym: So how many fat?

280
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,347
Rym: Indignant slow people are there in Scandinavia?

281
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:19,172
Scott: They've got other kinds of out.

282
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,776
Rym: They do but it's it's cold.

283
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:25,010
Rym: Yeah, that's enough That's not outrage that's all right, that's something.

284
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,134
Scott: it's just you're so cold.

285
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:27,859
Scott: You don't look outraged you're just shivering.

286
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:29,832
Rym: Yeah, but you're not gonna make on the inside.

287
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:34,394
Scott: The outrage is like 10x And the beer is also 10x.

288
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,419
Rym: So things of the day This is just a kid's toy.

289
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:51,017
Rym: it all they can say is numbers But in the fashion of everyone awesome.

290
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:55,690
Rym: someone discovered that you can fairly trivially make it say motherfucker fuck and fuck you.

291
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:59,080
Scott: I wonder if it was designed into the toy or just an accident.

292
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,407
Rym: I'm pretty sure 50/50.

293
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:08,710
Rym: It's just an accident But I enjoy any time something like this happens like the guy who realized that Cookie Monster can also sing romp.

294
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,820
Scott: Well, the best is when you get like an eight-year-old.

295
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:21,335
Scott: you sort of knows the bad words and then he discovers it and like nursery School or something in the in the playroom and that is where the awesomeness happens Take away the toy.

296
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,022
Scott: I mean, it's just an innocent toy.

297
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:25,290
Rym: You didn't know when I was a little kid.

298
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,483
Rym: I was like six and my brother was like three and a half.

299
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:30,250
Rym: Maybe he was four and he was in the kitchen.

300
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:32,210
Rym: You know kids just like do stuff.

301
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:40,794
Rym: He was just in the kitchen like on a stool in the kitchen sink Just like doing stuff in the kitchen sink Like he filled it with water and he was doing something whatever kids do And he dropped something.

302
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:42,439
Rym: and just from the other room.

303
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,164
Rym: We hear this four-year-old boy.

304
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:48,739
Rym: Just yell son of a bitch And it was one of the funniest things I'd ever experienced.

305
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,502
Scott: Yeah, that's good.

306
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:50,144
Scott: I like that.

307
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:51,348
Rym: So motherfucker.

308
00:18:51,368 --> 00:18:51,690
Rym: What do you got?

309
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:57,610
Scott: So, you know an f1 the steering wheels are totally insane, yeah, they got a billion knobblies on him, right?

310
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:06,143
Scott: Well in this video Nico Rosberg who is sort of like I don't think he's actually won anything any championships At least not that I remember.

311
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:15,555
Scott: maybe I'm wrong But I remember that when he was brand new to f1 They were like they were all talking about like oh how great he was and like, you know They're like the testing and such.

312
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:19,570
Scott: like he had he had passed the test like better than any other rookie ever or something like that.

313
00:19:19,673 --> 00:19:28,480
Scott: but anyway He in this video he describes what everything on his steering wheel does except there might be something hidden on the back cuz he doesn't Show you the back of the steering wheel.

314
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,728
Scott: So there might be something secret back there.

315
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:36,632
Scott: But at least on the front he tells you what every one of those knobs does and it's so clearly now pretty interesting if I Want to.

316
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:40,369
Rym: I am fully aware of what I need to do to drive an f1 car.

317
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:44,482
Scott: Well, you don't know how to work the pedals Gas and brake clutch.

318
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:47,410
Scott: the clutch is first of all The clutch is on the steering wheel All right.

319
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:52,850
Scott: Second of all this gas brake and then there's a bunch of other levers to adjust other things that you that were in the car.

320
00:19:53,215 --> 00:20:00,280
Rym: so according to Wikipedia the wheels cost about 25,000 pounds and are made of carbon fiber.

321
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:03,290
Rym: Yep, and it doesn't say anything about the back or a secret.

322
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,402
Scott: Yeah, but I guess you know, they told him not to show anyone the back.

323
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:08,450
Rym: So I wonder something back there.

324
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,070
Rym: Yeah, I mean you think it's the like the wiring heart.

325
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:17,510
Scott: I think it is because and you can see the whole back of the steering wheel on television Whenever they're showing the front view of the driver's helmet.

326
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:21,990
Scott: But what you can't see is the part of the steering wheel that actually connects to the steering column.

327
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:24,218
Scott: That must be where the secret magic is.

328
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,303
Rym: I don't think it's that.

329
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:29,998
Scott: I think either he's got another button Or he could have another button and they're hiding they're cheating.

330
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:34,410
Rym: or I think there's some sort of maybe the design of the paddle Or something like on the back.

331
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,369
Rym: There's some design and the way he's got the grips that they think is great and they don't want anyone to see it.

332
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:40,467
Rym: Possible?

333
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:43,409
Rym: or Maybe he's just fucking with us.

334
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:44,716
Scott: No, cuz I'm pretty.

335
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:47,228
Scott: he seemed like he wanted to show it to you, but he was told not to.

336
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:50,869
Rym: yeah Maybe he was told not to just because they're like, hey, let's pretend there's something on the back.

337
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:52,787
Scott: No, you know, they're always so secret in the f1.

338
00:20:53,113 --> 00:21:01,210
Scott: Yeah I guess the only reason they even showed the front is because it's probably public knowledge anyway And he gets some attention and you can see the whole front no matter where you look.

339
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,218
Scott: I just really can't hide the front of things.

340
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:07,174
Rym: You can hide the back to the day when we finally get f0 I know.

341
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:08,641
Scott: Oh my god, if there's ever f0.

342
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:09,284
Scott: I'm signing up.

343
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,268
Rym: You're signing up.

344
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:11,774
Rym: Yep You think you'll be able to hack it?

345
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:13,642
Scott: Have you seen the drivers in f0?

346
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,649
Rym: Have you seen big bad guy?

347
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,739
Rym: Actually, we need to watch red line.

348
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,929
Scott: Do we need to watch it real bad?

349
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:20,013
Rym: I'll get it.

Rym: We may be at Otakon.

366
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:52,603
Rym: It really depends on whether or not they accept our panels But if they accept them we'll be there.

367
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:57,890
Rym: if we're not there It means they didn't want us to do panels despite us doing almost a decade worth of panels.

368
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,399
Scott: Nerd NYC recess is June 18th.

00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:12,221
Scott: Also, you should actually go to front row crew calm.

373
00:22:12,262 --> 00:22:21,129
Scott: a lot of people they just subscribe to us in iTunes Or maybe they go directly to the forum and they don't go to front row crew calm which is where you can find every episode of the show among other things.

374
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:30,388
Scott: and I'm gonna be adding more things there After this weekend when my time becomes more for your Many things become finished.

00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:31,617
Scott: this week There's a feed for like.

Rym: you know You just want to get the feed of the things of the day the links to all this stuff.

378
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,970
Rym: There's all kinds of stuff and it's not integrated with the site yet.

379
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,529
Rym: But like I said earlier my youtube account GeekNights Rym has three of our.

380
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:49,744
Rym: well one of our panels that included three panels from paxies and Of my little pony video that I made.

381
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:50,570
Rym: that's very popular.

382
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:55,008
Scott: There's also a GeekNights' YouTube account and my youtube account which is a PR ECHE.

383
00:22:55,641 --> 00:23:03,270
Rym: Yeah And there will be something special appearing in my GeekNights Rym YouTube account in the next week or so.

384
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:07,570
Scott: I'm gonna be making a video pretty soon of what happens when you put a helicopter in the elevator.

385
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:13,715
Rym: Ah, I will be having a video about my year with the dragon But that is not the secret video.

386
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:22,227
Rym: a few listeners know what that is, but something special is coming And I hope you'll like it, okay, you're really gonna like it.

387
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:31,165
Rym: yeah Get your ass to Mars to Mars Get eats quaid.

388
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:41,038
Scott: so like we said We discovered recently that some of the people in our crew had not seen the movie total recall a very important science fiction action film from the 90s.

389
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:50,268
Scott: so we got it on DVD real cheap at the book off and We finally got around to watching it with those people and now they have seen it But they are not here to comment on it.

390
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:52,838
Scott: instead We are here to comment on it people who have seen it in our youth.

391
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,483
Scott: yep, and then again.

392
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:59,376
Rym: I had not I'd seen total recall Probably in 1990.

393
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:06,604
Scott: I I saw it in the late mid to mid ish 90s And I saw it again in the late night probably on television theater.

394
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:07,890
Rym: I think we rented.

395
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:09,438
Scott: I don't think I saw it on the theater.

396
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,650
Rym: I'm pretty sure we rented it from a video store.

397
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:21,882
Scott: I'm pretty sure I saw it on a VHS and also on TV with commercials, and then I'm pretty sure I also saw it perhaps Sometime at RIT or maybe during a summer.

398
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:22,405
Scott: I don't remember.

399
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:23,490
Rym: I just it was weird.

400
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:30,967
Rym: It was one of those movies that when I was a kid like I just assumed Everyone had seen it kind of like I don't know Terminator 2.

401
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:36,370
Scott: well there words I knew there were some kids who didn't see it because you know it is pretty gory and also has boobies in it.

402
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,685
Scott: So there were some kids who were not permitted to see it.

403
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,110
Rym: Yeah Or I was going to our at the time it came out when I was a little kid.

404
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,016
Rym: I mean, I saw a Robocop like right away.

405
00:24:45,037 --> 00:24:48,147
Rym: Yeah, anyway, but I didn't actually like.

406
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:48,950
Rym: I remembered the plot.

407
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:49,918
Scott: I remember the plot.

408
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:51,249
Scott: I remembered some scenes.

409
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:59,589
Rym: I remembered all the important scenes because the important scenes in total recall are pretty much when he rips that Johnny cab apart Yeah, when he pulls the thing out of his nose.

410
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,770
Scott: I actually forgot about the Johnny cab until I saw it that I remember the job.

411
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:05,149
Scott: When he pulls the thing out of I remember pulling the thing out of it.

412
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,260
Rym: Yeah, three breasted hooker three breast.

413
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,205
Scott: he can't forget that one.

414
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:09,230
Rym: I forgot the midget hooker.

415
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,395
Scott: I remember the ending.

416
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:17,143
Scott: I remembered all the parts where you know he went into the memory machine And I remembered some of the action scenes.

417
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:18,390
Rym: got y'all house to Mars.

418
00:25:18,571 --> 00:25:22,384
Scott: I actually forgot about the guy in the stomach until I until I saw him.

419
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:24,110
Scott: then I was all right forgotten kawatu.

420
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:25,716
Scott: I Dennis actually saw kawatu.

421
00:25:25,736 --> 00:25:27,684
Scott: I was like all right kawatu right.

422
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:34,590
Rym: and I also remembered I remember that the guy was a traitor that none of it actually happened, and it was just a dream and planted into his brain.

423
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,222
Scott: Well, it's sort of like Inception.

424
00:25:36,262 --> 00:25:36,383
Scott: right.

425
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:40,783
Rym: you could go either way Good, but the evidence is overwhelming by the way spoilers.

426
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:42,590
Rym: if you haven't seen total recall what you want fuck.

427
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:47,924
Scott: so When this is not for people who haven't seen total recall by though.

428
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:58,368
Rym: here's my primary evidence And I don't think I need any other evidence, and I can dismiss the few points of evidence against me By saying that the movie was somewhat poorly constructed.

429
00:25:58,388 --> 00:25:59,755
Scott: all right I'll play a game all right.

430
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:07,388
Rym: one of the only evidence you need is that when he goes in to get his You know his memory he's gonna buy that trip to Mars and put his ass there.

431
00:26:07,408 --> 00:26:17,452
Rym: as The tech is taking the little CD looking thing to load up the program He holds the case and he looks at it and it very quietly in the background says huh blue skies on Mars That's a new one.

432
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:18,416
Rym: That's true.

433
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:21,227
Rym: I think that's clinches it all right, so I got.

434
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:22,491
Scott: I got two points All right.

435
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,595
Scott: number one right.

436
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:34,010
Scott: if the whole movie was from the time when he first goes into the machine at recall Yeah, very end of the movie is if that is the memory that is implanted that whole thing right?

437
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:40,022
Scott: then Why would they implant a memory in which he does not end up where he started?

438
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:42,349
Scott: otherwise it would be inconsistent with ah?

439
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:45,235
Rym: Movie.

440
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:46,623
Rym: he they just didn't show you the end.

441
00:26:46,723 --> 00:26:56,630
Rym: I mean it's it's basically Brazil without that little clip at the end where they're like oh yeah by the way in case you didn't get I mean if they're Selling you vacations the vacations would have to end with you coming back home.

442
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,235
Rym: Yeah, they didn't show that in the movie.

443
00:26:58,556 --> 00:27:05,250
Scott: so somehow you're saying after that the memory continues and somehow He ends up back home with the wife that he killed.

444
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:08,098
Rym: Yeah He remembers all this.

445
00:27:08,118 --> 00:27:10,930
Scott: he said he remembers killing his wife as part of his vacation.

446
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:13,116
Scott: What kind of a who sells a vacation like that?

447
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:17,970
Rym: uh clearly this company has some has some Cave Johnson in it.

448
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,899
Rym: I mean who is selling that memory was pretty cave job.

449
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:24,532
Scott: is possible that they sold him a memory that would totally fuck up his Life?

450
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:35,730
Rym: it's also possible that they sell the memory But maybe the way it works is they play it out in his head like a dream with stimuli to imprint it But his conscious brain is reacting.

451
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:40,508
Rym: Maybe but anyway um because he acted like himself just with superpowers.

452
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:40,910
Scott: It's true.

453
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,579
Scott: So here's a second is another isn't?

454
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,470
Rym: so he must just really hate his wife, maybe?

455
00:27:45,551 --> 00:27:52,530
Scott: So there's the scene where the wife and the psychologist show up, and they tell him that he's you know in inside of recall.

456
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,263
Rym: That's just a really clever scene that they put in the scenario.

457
00:27:56,564 --> 00:27:57,888
Scott: or was it true?

458
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:08,380
Scott: and actually The reason that the dream doesn't the reason that the vacation doesn't match up and bring him back home at the end is Because he really was being lobotomized.

459
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,125
Scott: and there that's the real ending is.

460
00:28:10,145 --> 00:28:14,261
Scott: so it was all recalls You're right, but it wasn't that wasn't the dream.

461
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:14,944
Scott: They intended.

462
00:28:14,964 --> 00:28:16,530
Scott: You know what I actually got lobotomized.

463
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,449
Scott: I'm going to place like they said and that was real.

464
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:23,084
Rym: I accept your point as an alternate answer because it still proves to me right.

465
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:26,949
Rym: my core point was not that The whole thing was a dream.

466
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:47,990
Rym: My main argument against is that they show you a couple of scenes where Quaid's not there to see anything But there are many scenes where Quaid is not but at the same time they don't show Quaid knowing about that information and Maybe he just remembers it.

467
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:48,573
Rym: Maybe that's just.

468
00:28:48,754 --> 00:28:51,469
Rym: you know Verhoeven not being the best director in the world.

469
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:54,402
Scott: Yeah, like the goldfish Quaid is never in that office.

470
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:56,130
Scott: Yeah, right as far as I can remember.

471
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:58,516
Rym: So yeah that the other thing is.

472
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:06,005
Scott: it went to perfectly of course, I mean he's basically an invincible superhero Yeah, but I mean in terms of you know was the movie good.

473
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:06,910
Scott: I think it's pretty good.

474
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,548
Scott: It's not Terminator 2, but it's like one step under.

475
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:18,216
Rym: well It's a sci-fi part of Terminator 2 I think hold up pretty well one these the action scenes because this is a 90s movie But it's the beginning.

476
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:20,948
Rym: It's 1990. the action scenes reek of 80s.

477
00:29:21,772 --> 00:29:22,314
Scott: Well, they do.

478
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:25,525
Scott: the action scenes do reek of 80s, but they're clearly aid.

479
00:29:25,605 --> 00:29:30,822
Rym: it's Arnold with a machine gun going Million bullets, they're really not so bad.

480
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:32,510
Scott: It's not like they're painful to watch.

481
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:44,630
Scott: Yeah, right, but the problem is that since then we've had such advances in action scene choreography, you know now I know the matrix didn't cause those advances and it was simply stealing from you know, Asian cinema.

482
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:45,913
Rym: But

483
00:29:45,973 --> 00:30:05,130
Scott: the matrix did introduce those advanced fight choreography Techniques to the Western audience and because of that we have you know Western audiences in general have now gotten used to much much higher Expectations of what kind of things you're gonna see in action scenes and that you know causes total recall to be dated in that respect.

484
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:06,298
Scott: But really it's not.

485
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,010
Scott: it's not like I'm watching the action scenes going.

486
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:09,557
Scott: Oh, it's so bad.

487
00:30:09,577 --> 00:30:11,947
Scott: Like when you look at the CG and Tron now, right?

488
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:18,990
Scott: It's not like that It's just you know And also some of the action scenes with like the drill are pretty cool.

489
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:30,390
Rym: Yeah It is clearly also more 80s than 90s in that the technology of the future apparently is just 80s technology But more of it, I mean, well, that's something that's something that gets right.

490
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:37,080
Scott: So in the beginning of the movie when he's in the apartment with the with the wife They got this incredible flat-screen TV.

491
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,130
Scott: It's like part of the wall and it can actually be three panel.

492
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:40,672
Rym: How do you know?

493
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:45,129
Rym: it's not just a giant CRT but then the rest of the movie is all CRT's.

494
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,519
Rym: But this is their vision of the future.

495
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,910
Rym: It's like 80s culture extended into the future.

496
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:53,812
Rym: TVs fucking everywhere and They suck.

497
00:30:54,474 --> 00:31:00,817
Rym: Yeah, and no one has any way to communicate except payphones, but the payphones have TVs in them I know right and it's just.

498
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,761
Rym: everything really looks like the 80s Like it's not like Ferris Bueller, which is set in the 80s.

499
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,568
Rym: It's set in the future, but it looks like the 80s.

500
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:10,257
Scott: This is the problem.

501
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:14,902
Scott: if you make anything that's set in the past You can't become dated.

502
00:31:14,982 --> 00:31:16,550
Scott: It's guaranteed to be timeless.

503
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:19,746
Scott: But if you make anything ever that's set in the future, right?

504
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,681
Scott: It could unless it's like Star Wars.

505
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:27,017
Scott: right Star Wars pulls the ultimate trick Long time ago galaxy far far away.

506
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:35,916
Scott: A lot of people don't actually think and we oh shit long time ago Star Wars is in the past And that's how right.

507
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:40,919
Scott: and by making it a totally different time and a totally different place They can do whatever the hell they want.

508
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,109
Scott: But because total recall is earth This earth in the future.

509
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:49,570
Scott: Pretty much you're going to be dated at some point no matter what year you said it at.

510
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,842
Scott: I mean how many animes are set in 20x DX and shit?

511
00:31:52,942 --> 00:31:53,404
Scott: Oh my god.

512
00:31:53,464 --> 00:31:54,508
Scott: It's actually now it's 20x DX.

513
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:56,529
Rym: We fucked well, I mean October in.

514
00:31:57,553 --> 00:31:59,581
Rym: That was the end day.

515
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:00,825
Scott: No, not the Saturday.

516
00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:04,210
Rym: I was at a football game But this Saturday isn't the end day.

517
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,298
Rym: That was a better end day.

518
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:07,442
Rym: It was all you can't.

519
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:14,610
Scott: you can't make any work of art You can't tell any story about the future of Earth without being dated unless it's near future.

520
00:32:14,871 --> 00:32:19,749
Scott: It's not possible because you can't get it exactly right, but at the same time you can do it.

521
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:26,271
Scott: Well, you can look at Minority Report, which actually people, you know is the movie that people are always like, oh, yeah It gets.

522
00:32:26,332 --> 00:32:28,361
Scott: you know, it's like Minority Report, right?

523
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,170
Rym: Well, here's one way to look at it.

524
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,150
Rym: Look at a movie like Ferris Bueller where it's set in the 80s and it works.

525
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:46,070
Rym: Look at a movie like Terminator 2 where while it's got a lot of futuristic stuff It uses like good techniques from its era so that it doesn't like it doesn't use crappy 90s soundtrack.

526
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:49,280
Scott: Well, I think what Terminator 2's advantage right?

527
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,097
Scott: Is that the future of Terminator 2 is the post-apocalyptic Fantasy future.

528
00:32:54,157 --> 00:32:56,810
Scott: Yeah, even though it's sci-fi because it's robots and machines.

529
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:04,940
Rym: Compare all the movies from the era of Terminator 2. a lot of them have Crappy, you know late 80s early 90s synth soundtracks.

530
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,270
Rym: That's true pop songs that really stand out.

531
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:14,710
Rym: Yeah, it's the worst thing to do that but Terminator 2 orchestral sound has one of the better soundtracks in the history of movies.

532
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,134
Scott: That's true.

533
00:33:15,154 --> 00:33:16,727
Rym: I mean how many people?

534
00:33:16,768 --> 00:33:32,010
Scott: just Yeah, that's why I'm a big fan of pretty much everything Either using you know, I really don't like it when people use, you know, like actual songs like from radio.

535
00:33:33,393 --> 00:33:34,116
Rym: No, here's my third thing.

536
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:37,210
Rym: Remember I watched the the Lost Boys recently because Emily never seen it.

537
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:39,498
Rym: It's a great vampire movie from the 80s.

538
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:42,589
Rym: Yeah 90s Corey Haim Corey Feldman all those guys.

539
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:50,361
Rym: Yep, and it is set in that time and it plays all songs from that time like Saxophone.

540
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:54,030
Scott: I Was about to say if you're making a Vietnam movie, right?

541
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,490
Scott: You always got to use those same songs.

542
00:33:56,812 --> 00:34:02,470
Scott: I like give me shelter by the stones and all the same songs You got to do if you're doing a Vietnam movie.

543
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:03,349
Rym: I don't do that.

544
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:08,971
Rym: If you just make if it happens to be that year and you're making a movie that's set at some generic time Yeah You can't.

545
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:15,601
Scott: I'm talking about when somebody makes a movie and because the movie happened to be made in 2006 they use in the movie.

546
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:19,097
Scott: the soundtrack is the hit songs of 2006. that is.

547
00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:22,210
Scott: the problem is when you just use the hit songs of the day.

548
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:27,587
Scott: The movie was released as promotional things as opposed to picking songs that fit the movie.

549
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:38,255
Scott: and I still prefer original score orchestral if possible right or musical like ponies or broadish or show tunes to Using hit songs.

550
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:43,469
Scott: because then you're the reason I prefer that is because a most of the great movies do that.

551
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:47,547
Scott: It's just like a. you know, there's a there's a correlation there and two.

552
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:49,654
Scott: It makes more music.

553
00:34:49,674 --> 00:34:50,777
Scott: You're making new music.

554
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,730
Scott: You're creating more art as opposed to you know, you're actually making less art.

555
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,793
Rym: What about a movie?

556
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:01,646
Rym: That's like a mat cross kind of thing where it makes a new hit song that happens to also be a hit song.

557
00:35:02,874 --> 00:35:03,340
Scott: That's fine.

558
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:09,310
Scott: Yeah, Matt cross You did both orchestral sort of rock and show tunes for itself that were originally new.

559
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,603
Scott: They created new music for the new show.

560
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:15,440
Scott: as opposed to you know It's like you're there's more art created in the world.

561
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,702
Scott: if you decide to spend money to record new music It is if you just use existing music, you're actually making less stuff.

562
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:23,167
Scott: That's the main thing.

563
00:35:23,347 --> 00:35:24,190
Rym: So here's something weird.

564
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,015
Rym: I noticed that I never noticed before.

565
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:30,388
Rym: Benny the cab driver the assholes also a mutant.

566
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:42,270
Rym: Yep They foreshadow the fact that he was gonna die by a drill and pilot a drill Like crazily Every time you like you see him like he's driving or something.

567
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:49,947
Rym: There are three scenes in the movie well before he drives the drill and tries to kill them and then gets drilled Where you see him and then you immediately see one of those drills.

568
00:35:50,229 --> 00:35:54,222
Rym: Yep They do that three times like they're being like hey, he's gonna get drilled.

569
00:35:54,624 --> 00:36:03,003
Rym: and apparently the movie was originally rated X. Yep, they had to cut several Ultraviolet sections of existing scenes to get the movie to our.

570
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:04,830
Scott: one of them was thing is if that movie.

571
00:36:05,091 --> 00:36:09,896
Scott: Here's the thing if they had the original cut of the movie the one that was originally rated X Yeah that came out today.

572
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:13,010
Scott: It would not be rated X. Nope and the same thing with Hellraiser, right?

573
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,901
Scott: These were not porn.

574
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:26,689
Scott: nowadays you have to be a hardcore porn to be rated X or I guess maybe something like each of the killer might be if they Bothered to rate it, but I mean, you know, the original cut of Total Recall would no way be rated X.

575
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:29,619
Rym: today Really X doesn't do.

576
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:30,464
Rym: it have to be MD.

577
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:38,830
Rym: MD They Show you what happened to Benny instead of just kind of implying what happened to Benny.

578
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,451
Rym: Yeah and they also the scene where he I Love.

579
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:48,230
Rym: when Arnold is in a movie and in the end the thing that saves him is the fact that he's just Arnold.

580
00:36:48,432 --> 00:36:55,382
Rym: Yeah, I mean in the end Things often stabs the one scientist in the neck.

581
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,710
Scott: that's yeah, that's what you see in an Arnold movie.

582
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,230
Rym: Apparently they cut out a lot of him stabbing other scientists in that scene.

583
00:37:01,631 --> 00:37:03,157
Scott: It's actually, you know surprising though.

584
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:16,344
Scott: You go to look at Arnold's movies Terminator 2 Total Recall Predator and Running Man and you know these kinds of movies and it's like it's kind of surprising how a lot of the other Action movie stars, you know

585
00:37:16,365 --> 00:37:16,525
Rym: Stallone

586
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,676
Scott: Yeah, a lot of them pretty

587
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:19,640
Rym: much Tom Selleck

588
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,650
Scott: just did boring action.

589
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,821
Scott: But you know Arnold did a lot.

590
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,570
Scott: you mean Arnold did his share of boring action.

591
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,361
Scott: I mean a race, you know, he's got bad movies eraser crap, right?

592
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:36,523
Scott: But I like last action hero, though It's okay, but okay The point is is that he did a lot of movies that actually had a plot.

593
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:38,950
Scott: That was a pretty good sci-fi plot.

594
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:44,890
Rym: Yeah, I mean Total Recall is based somewhat loosely on a Philip K dick dick story and it's a pretty good sci-fi.

595
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:46,762
Rym: Just they threw in a lot of Arnold.

596
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:50,788
Scott: Yeah, of course, you know It's a it's a two-for-one deal.

597
00:37:52,991 --> 00:37:58,370
Rym: Also because I haven't seen an Arnold movie in a while Motherfucker makes some great faces sometimes.

598
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:04,530
Rym: Well, you know, it's not like he's not playing a character he's playing Arnold playing a character, right?

599
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,274
Scott: But it's you know, it's.

600
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:06,260
Scott: everyone had.

601
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,850
Scott: it gets a start for a reason, right?

602
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,512
Scott: Even people.

603
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:12,390
Scott: you might you know, you look at famous people, right and it's like how did you know?

604
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,057
Scott: This person isn't talented or they suck.

605
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:14,579
Scott: I hate them.

606
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:16,930
Scott: But the fact is they got to start somewhere, right?

607
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,033
Scott: They didn't start out famous.

608
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:22,770
Scott: They had some sort of talent or something that got them off on the right foot somewhere.

609
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:26,970
Scott: It might have just been something shallow like good looks or an Arnold's case.

610
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,190
Scott: He was like, you know ultra muscly because he was a bodybuilder or whatever.

611
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:36,095
Scott: But he had to have some acting skills what you know in order to get into movies they just wouldn't have.

612
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:41,382
Scott: you know, if he didn't sell tickets and Wasn't able to act directors wouldn't want him.

613
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:48,908
Rym: You know, he had something going on Whoa, so supposedly in the early like when they were trying to get this movie made Philip K dick was still alive.

614
00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:51,234
Rym: Yeah, and They went through.

615
00:38:51,274 --> 00:38:54,770
Rym: they thought about getting Richard Dreyfuss or Patrick Swayze to play Quaid.

616
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:59,976
Scott: Okay, that would have been a very different movie totally different movie Not even close to the same movie.

617
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:00,578
Rym: You know what though?

618
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:07,170
Rym: I think Stallone could have maybe pulled it off Tom Selleck would have pulled it off just fine.

619
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:16,881
Scott: I think Bruce Willis Bruce Willis might have made this one of the best movies that he's the breeze pretty much the other guy who does action movies that Are also have some intelligent sci-fi thing.

620
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:21,117
Rym: Yeah, and he also nearly sci-fi A lot of his action movies.

621
00:39:21,558 --> 00:39:22,441
Rym: He's Bruce Willis.

622
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:22,983
Rym: That's right.

623
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:25,250
Rym: And I love Bruce Willis and I love Arnold.

624
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:26,888
Rym: Yeah, not Arnold but Arnold.

625
00:39:28,893 --> 00:39:35,289
Scott: Anyway, you know in in related news I also wanted to watch this movie because there's actually a total recall comic book coming out.

626
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:38,404
Scott: Oh I ordered the first issue just because curious.

627
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:39,690
Scott: I don't know if it's gonna be good.

628
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:49,925
Scott: I actually doubt it will be good, but I actually saw the cover To the second issue because I they sent me the evil catalog I hate for free and the second issue has aliens on the cover.

629
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,278
Scott: So I guess We're gonna find out right.

630
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:55,170
Scott: I guess if you're if you're right or not.

631
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,370
Scott: It goes this comic is canon and it picks up where the movie left off.

632
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,670
Rym: Well, well, apparently there's a script for total recall - that was never made.

633
00:40:02,112 --> 00:40:02,996
Scott: There's a script for every.

634
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:08,941
Rym: no, so, you know what is based on minority report And it picks up right after where Quaid is still Quaid.

635
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:09,643
Scott: Well, there you go.

636
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:11,329
Scott: Yeah, how about that?

637
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:13,075
Scott: Yeah But I mean that's another thing.

638
00:40:13,115 --> 00:40:23,030
Scott: right is if you go with my theory that he was really lobotomized And that means he's probably a vegetable but he's probably Dreaming this vacation until the day his vegetable body dies.

639
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:31,629
Scott: so it could just be that you know that continue any continuation you come up with is all in his brain and It's part of his infinite vacation until he his body runs out.

640
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:37,682
Scott: You know though I would say and since he's got a pretty muscly body It's gonna be a while if you've never seen total recall.

641
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,270
Scott: Why did you listen this far?

642
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,719
Rym: I highly recommend seeing it because it is a very enjoyable movie.

643
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:51,347
Rym: It's definitely iconic of 90s action movies like basically Until the matrix all good action movies were kind of like this.

644
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:59,010
Scott: Yeah I'm a matrix like above Terminator 2 just because and I put total recall one step lower than that.

645
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,760
Rym: Well because Terminator 2 all did the same thing.

646
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,586
Rym: the matrix did like movies were action.

647
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:04,530
Rym: movies were a certain way.

648
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:06,739
Rym: Terminator 1 was just another action movie.

649
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:09,430
Rym: Terminator 2 happened and the entire world went whoa.

650
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:11,821
Rym: And then movies changed forever.

651
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:12,950
Scott: We need a new we need a neck.

652
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:14,754
Rym: Terminator 2 did that.

653
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:15,878
Rym: the matrix did that.

654
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:17,082
Rym: Star Wars did that.

655
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:17,764
Scott: we need one.

656
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:19,690
Scott: we need something to break us out.

657
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,830
Scott: Did you know that there are more movie sequels this summer than ever ever in history randomly?

658
00:41:25,914 --> 00:41:27,989
Scott: There's 20. there are 27 sequels coming out this year.

659
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:33,430
Scott: I had to clean up living need something like Star Wars Terminator 2 or the matrix to break something a blockbuster.

660
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,599
Scott: I mean we can make all the great art films we want.

661
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,490
Scott: there are plenty of them, but they're not gonna change Hollywood.

662
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:50,570
Scott: We need something big like matrix Star Wars Terminator 2 - I have Hollywood has gold member Buster a few days ago while I was gold member the Austin Powers one yeah, not as funny as the first.

663
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:52,660
Rym: You know what not even funny at all.

664
00:41:52,861 --> 00:41:54,468
Rym: Yeah, that was a terrible movie.

665
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:58,999
Scott: I I still like the first one I like the first one is the second one.

666
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:05,005
Scott: the girl is way hot like the hottest But the third one has the hottest girl, but the I think the second one.

667
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:08,539
Scott: the second one has the hottest girl Foxy 70s.

668
00:42:08,924 --> 00:42:11,358
Scott: oh, yeah And the first they've got.

669
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:14,855
Scott: not that the girl in the first movie isn't incredibly hot either It's just the second movie.

670
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:16,280
Scott: one is tiny bit hotter.

671
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:16,541
Rym: No.

672
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:17,967
Rym: There's no anapuma.

673
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:18,830
Scott: No there's.

674
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:21,917
Scott: We're getting off topic.

675
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:35,429
Rym: yeah, I think we're running out of steam here, I mean I Think that total recall is a fine movie and the sci-fi angle is good, but if you want an Arnold action movie I think running man is a better Arnold movie.

676
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:39,544
Scott: I would put my if I had to rank are not a better movie.

677
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:40,990
Rym: It's a better Arnold movie.

678
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:43,181
Scott: I think predator is better.

679
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:44,730
Rym: Oh predator is better as well.

680
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,959
Rym: I haven't seen predator up ready since I was a little kid.

681
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,025
Rym: really I haven't seen.

682
00:42:51,426 --> 00:43:02,890
Scott: I mean when I had this um In high school I took a sci-fi class But it ended up being filled with like a bunch of these sort of funny Frat drunk you guys and all they wanted to do is watch predators every day in class.

683
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,550
Scott: They'd be like the predator and then on the last day of class the teacher was cool, and we watch predator.
