1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,838
Rym: It's Monday, September 26th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:11,019
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:14,210
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,897
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:18,470
Rym: Tonight, the problem of Link Rot.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,279
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:27,390
Rym: It's autumn.

8
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:28,789
Scott: Great.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,878
Rym: Yeah, that means two very important things to me.

10
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,390
Rym: One, I get my goddamn hour back.

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,829
Rym: They took that hour from me at PAX.

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,890
Scott: Yeah, that was PAX's fault.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:38,651
Rym: Yeah.

14
00:00:39,194 --> 00:00:42,350
Rym: Thing is, I would rather they take the hour away and never give it back.

15
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:46,170
Rym: I would rather just stay in Daylight Savings Time all the goddamn time.

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:52,310
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's annoying to lose the hour, but it's no problem if we actually keep the fucking sun coming up.

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:58,130
Rym: Well, if you're born after you lost the hour, you don't lose the hour unless we continue to switch back and forth.

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,669
Rym: Why don't we just move, you know, let's spring back, or let's move forward, I don't know, like three hours and just leave it.

19
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:04,788
Scott: That'd be cool.

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,709
Rym: 'Cause I don't want it to be light out until I get home from work.

21
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:18,430
Scott: Here's another thing, right, is it's like we have these time zones, everyone can have local time, you know, it's like you gotta get used to the, you know, so everyone can wake up around six, seven, and go to bed, right?

22
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:27,130
Scott: It's like, why don't we just everyone use UCT, and you just get used to whatever the clock happens to be in your area.

23
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,569
Scott: So in one time zone in the world, the times are gonna be what people are used to.

24
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:36,466
Scott: But in other time zones, it's like we'll just have to get used to the fact that what used to be seven is now noon.

25
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:45,590
Rym: You know what, it'll never happen because people are dumb, but being in the financial sector, I think in GTC anyway.

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,830
Scott: Yeah, right.

27
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,950
Rym: I mean, universal time, you know, and 24 hour clock too, not just, none of this AM, PM, BS.

28
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,690
Scott: Yeah, that's another thing is a lot of the rest of the world just uses 24 hour clocks for everything, and doesn't use 24 hour, 12 hour clocks.

29
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,349
Rym: What we could do, I mean, remember, we had the metric system, right?

30
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:04,930
Rym: Well, Napoleon, they also had metric time, we could go to that.

31
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:05,730
Scott: Uh, no.

32
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,263
Scott: Why not?

33
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,169
Scott: Because metric time is stupid and broken.

34
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,190
Rym: Why is it broken?

35
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,370
Scott: Because it's stupid and broken, because one second, right?

36
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,270
Rym: Is a second in any way fundamental?

37
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:17,086
Rym: Yes.

38
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:17,829
Rym: To what?

39
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:21,830
Scott: It is the amount of time it takes light to travel.

40
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:23,676
Rym: An arbitrary distance.

41
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:26,550
Rym: we decided to thereby define the terms.

42
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,010
Scott: Yes, exactly.

43
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:31,250
Rym: That's the opposite of the definition of intrinsic.

44
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,238
Scott: No.

45
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:33,768
Scott: Not at all.

46
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:36,070
Rym: Anyway.

47
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,350
Scott: It has to do with the speed of light and not with, you know.

48
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,830
Rym: No, it doesn't.

49
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,329
Scott: Yes, it does.

50
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,513
Rym: No.

51
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:41,170
Rym: Yes.

52
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,069
Rym: That's so wrong.

53
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,090
Rym: It's not wrong at all.

54
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,049
Rym: Yes, it is.

55
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:55,370
Rym: Anyway, the other important thing, somehow, at least in America, pumpkin pie is only available through the autumn season and into winter a little bit.

56
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,690
Scott: Well, isn't that what you want, right?

57
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,369
Scott: I mean, you know.

58
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,790
Rym: No, fucking pumpkin pie.

59
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,730
Rym: I want it every goddamn day.

60
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,290
Rym: I would eat it for breakfast without.

61
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,790
Scott: Here's the fucking problem, right?

62
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,750
Scott: So have you read these articles about the tomatoes?

63
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:08,328
Rym: I don't think so.

64
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,350
Scott: Okay, so apparently, right?

65
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,430
Scott: You know, you can go to the grocery store any time of the year and get tomatoes, but they always taste like shit.

66
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:18,370
Scott: And tomatoes you grow in your own backyard tastes awesome.

67
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,330
Scott: Apparently, I found out that how do we fucking get tomatoes when they're out of season?

68
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:26,368
Scott: How does that fucking work?

69
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:38,350
Rym: Depending on, you know, not to talk about tomatoes specifically, but basically you get them from wherever you get them and you either treat them so they don't ripen or you do all sorts of different things to keep things fresh until you ship them to their destination.

70
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:38,751
Scott: Nope.

71
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:43,130
Scott: Apparently, the reason we have tomatoes fresh, I mean, you know, in the.

72
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,590
Rym: Well, tomatoes you can grow hydroponically, I'd imagine.

73
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:56,770
Scott: The way we get tomatoes in the winter is basically the slave labor in Florida that is making them right in a in basically sand, which they're not supposed to grow in.

74
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,750
Scott: And they're using crazy whatever they can do to make them fucking grow.

75
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,710
Scott: Then they pick them before they're ripe.

76
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:07,250
Scott: Then they spray them with chemicals to make them turn red, even though they're not ripe at all, which is why they taste like nothing.

77
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:07,917
Scott: Right.

78
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:08,508
Scott: And they suck.

79
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:15,250
Scott: And then they drive them up here and they charge a ton of money for them just so that tomatoes can be on the grocery store shelves in the winter when they're out of season.

80
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:24,510
Rym: You know, Scott, you realize this is a. this is a movement that's been going on for a long time to localize food to where, by and large, maybe people should eat the food that is common in their area.

81
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,170
Scott: But it's not just the localization.

82
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:26,872
Scott: I mean, right.

83
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:27,835
Scott: Like an orange.

84
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:32,170
Scott: You can get an orange from Florida when it's in season and it'll be just fucking fine.

85
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:35,410
Scott: It's about getting the things when they're in season.

86
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:35,816
Scott: Right.

87
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:36,528
Scott: As opposed to.

88
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,650
Rym: But actually, Scott, they do many of the same things to transport things that are in season in one area to a place where they're never in season.

89
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,133
Scott: It's true.

90
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:45,768
Scott: But, you know, I mean, if you go to Florida, everything tastes better.

91
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:45,969
Scott: Right.

92
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:47,749
Rym: Except the water.

93
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,240
Scott: If you go to the water, I'm talking about fruits and vegetables.

94
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:54,110
Scott: If you go to California or if you go to the Mediterranean.

95
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,170
Rym: I argue the pizza is pretty shit.

96
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,150
Scott: Talking about the fruits and vegetables, they all taste better if you go to the place where they grow them.

97
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,519
Scott: But in New York, we grow some things.

98
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:05,110
Scott: We grow corns and tomatoes and apples.

99
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,329
Rym: We got some potatoes.

100
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,569
Scott: And not really.

101
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,409
Rym: Yeah, we can grow them here.

102
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:10,498
Scott: Yeah, you can.

103
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:11,790
Scott: But I mean, you'd rather go to Idaho.

104
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:17,810
Scott: Anyway, the point is, you can transport many fruits and vegetables just fine when they're in fucking season.

105
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,610
Scott: And yeah, you're complaining, though, that you can't get the pumpkin out of season.

106
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,370
Scott: Well, listen, if you got the pumpkin out of season, it would taste like shit.

107
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,883
Rym: No, it wouldn't, Scott, because pumpkin pie is made with pumpkin puree.

108
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:31,870
Rym: that's usually canned and processed anyway.

109
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:33,977
Scott: Then make your fucking own.

110
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:36,090
Scott: Get a can of pumpkin puree from the grocery store.

111
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,299
Rym: Yeah, you know what we have in the fridge right now?

112
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,409
Rym: Like four cans of pumpkin puree.

113
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:41,148
Scott: Good job.

114
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:42,070
Rym: Make some pumpkin pie.

115
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,370
Scott: Okay, then stop complaining.

116
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:49,470
Rym: What annoys me, though, is that like everything else in the world, at least as far as Americans are concerned, we can get it all the time.

117
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,006
Rym: We've got these huge systems in place, and pumpkin pie could be made at any time.

118
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,430
Rym: The ingredients are always available.

119
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:02,690
Rym: It's just restaurants and grocery stores and bakeries only make it October, November, December, January.

120
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,387
Scott: You know why?

121
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,390
Rym: Because they're dumbasses who don't realize that if we could eat pumpkin pie all the time, we would eat pumpkin pie all the time.

122
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:09,717
Rym: Nope.

123
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:22,810
Scott: Because pumpkin pie is disgusting, pumpkins are not for eating, they're only for carving and making decorations, and people only eat it when it's in season because of some traditional whatever, whatever, not because it actually tastes good.

124
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,170
Rym: You're a horrible person.

125
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,290
Scott: So the bakeries will only sell it when they can actually make money on it, which is when people feel obliged to buy it.

126
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:42,390
Rym: There are, in fact, I think Dave Riley, I'm gonna call Dave Riley and ask him, I'm pretty sure he will agree with me, that if pumpkin pie were available, any goddamn day of the year, that it is possible-

127
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,690
Scott: Is Dave Riley some sort of food god, where anything he says that is related to food is true?

128
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,870
Rym: I would trust Dave Riley's taste in eating things, because I note that he eats many of the same things that I eat.

129
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:53,109
Scott: But he is a professional.

130
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,649
Rym: And I'm only a master.

131
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:58,130
Scott: He's a professional at eating.

132
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,930
Rym: Anyways, pumpkin pie fucking season.

133
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,630
Rym: I'm gonna get my fucking pumpkin pie, it's gonna be delicious.

134
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,150
Scott: I should take a pumpkin pie and pee on it just cause.

135
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:10,090
Rym: Alright, you're gonna go buy one and pee on it, it's the season, I can get like a hundred pumpkin pies.

136
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,610
Scott: The thing is that'd be a waste of food, I should just give one to a homeless person and stuff.

137
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:17,309
Scott: Sadly- And if the homeless person pees on it, well, that's YouTube material.

138
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:26,170
Rym: Alright, so nerds are raging as they rage about a thing that Linux nerds in particular will often rage about.

139
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:33,290
Rym: This time, you know, a long time ago, Oracle, which, you know, we talk about evil companies and good companies and all that sort of stuff.

140
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:42,675
Rym: It's easy to forget that Oracle, with the sole exception being real networks, is probably the most consistently evil- Really?

141
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:43,630
Scott: Isn't real networks dead?

142
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:44,829
Rym: I think it's dead now.

143
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,244
Scott: There's more companies- Didn't they get bought by Oracle?

144
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:47,769
Rym: I don't remember.

145
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,670
Scott: I mean, Oracle's evil, but they're not the maximum evil.

146
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,850
Rym: They're not the maximum evil, but- I mean, Sony's about equally evil- I don't think Sony's equal, because Sony is more often incompetent than evil.

147
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,582
Scott: It's, well, I mean, we're talk- you know, can't ever tell the difference.

148
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:00,010
Scott: Maybe Oracle's also incompetent, right?

149
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:07,970
Rym: I don't think so, because consistently Oracle has often gone in the direction of anti-competition and against various IP things.

150
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:13,610
Rym: Oracle has often been the enemy to most open-source-y type people forever.

151
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:15,490
Scott: VirtualBox, they didn't ruin that yet.

152
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,334
Rym: No, not yet.

153
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:17,605
Rym: It'll come.

154
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:18,270
Rym: Give her time.

155
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:19,811
Rym: Give it time.

156
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:35,426
Rym: But they're making extensions to it, and those are not open-source.

157
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:36,289
Scott: They're binary extensions.

158
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,434
Scott: But, okay, but let me see.

159
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:41,210
Scott: The not- if you get the MySQL with no extensions- It is a database.

160
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,430
Scott: Is that the same MySQL that I use every goddamn day, or is that mis- or do they take stuff out of it?

161
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,783
Rym: So right now, yes, but they have these modules now.

162
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:53,049
Rym: MySQL Enterprise Monitor- Just don't fucking use that shit.

163
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,738
Rym: So for now, but here's the problem.

164
00:08:55,361 --> 00:09:03,791
Rym: If you want to back up to its root one, as soon as this happens with any open-source project, you know, a lot of people on Slashdot were saying, "Oh, don't worry.

165
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:05,914
Rym: We'll just fork the open-source code.

166
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:08,597
Rym: No matter what happens, we can engineer similar things in the community

167
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:08,937
Rym: version.".

168
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:15,186
Rym: And to that I say, "Yeah, OpenOffice is a fantastic replacement for

169
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:15,588
Rym: Word.".

170
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:20,096
Scott: Well, there are already a couple of MySQL things.

171
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:33,660
Scott: There's a project called Drizzle, which is- That's the MySQL team from before Oracle bought MySQL, and they're making Drizzle, which is a community-driven open-source project that is forked from MySQL.

172
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,543
Rym: Is it called Drizzle?

173
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:38,360
Scott: I could not- I was talking about this with coworkers this morning, and I could not remember the name of the fork.

174
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:46,180
Scott: So basically, the guys who were working on MySQL before Oracle bought it, they are making Drizzle, which is a C++ fork rewrite of MySQL.

175
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:54,540
Scott: There's another one, I forget what it's called, that's written by the guy who originally wrote MySQL, and that's like a totally different thing.

176
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:02,980
Scott: But there are plenty of databases out there that basically have this, you know, even though they're not MySQL, they have the exact same front end.

177
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,900
Scott: So you can use your MySQL client library to talk to it, and your application won't know the difference.

178
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,233
Rym: So like WordPress doesn't know.

179
00:10:08,294 --> 00:10:08,739
Rym: It just works.

180
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,639
Scott: Right, exactly.

181
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:17,760
Scott: There's another thing out there called VoltDB, which has a lot of sort of hype around it from the company that makes it.

182
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,460
Rym: Oh, whatever.

183
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:28,560
Scott: Yeah, but that also is, you know, it might have other issues, I wouldn't recommend it, but it also, I believe, has client library compatibility with MySQL.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,320
Rym: So the thing that's going on here is that this is a common business model for a company that owns an open-source thing.

185
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:38,908
Rym: And they can't just close it.

186
00:10:38,968 --> 00:10:41,259
Rym: You know they'd love to just close it and be like, "Yeah, you gotta pay for it

187
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,340
Rym: now.".

188
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:41,923
Scott: Well, they could.

189
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:44,678
Scott: They could just make a closed source the next version, and then...

190
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:54,540
Rym: Oh, they could, but some of the code they take out of it, depending on the license, not talking about this project, but in general, some licenses are more viral than others, and some things can't be closed completely.

191
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:56,779
Scott: I don't even know what the MySQL license is.

192
00:10:57,221 --> 00:11:06,820
Rym: It makes for a complicated situation, and also it causes immediate anger and backlash among even the far-close-to-center normal nerds on Linux.

193
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:14,740
Rym: But this sort of thing is interesting because it's still open source, and the change does not affect you unless you want the fancy stuff.

194
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:23,400
Rym: The problem is that typically what I think is going to happen is that eventually the fancy stuff is going to be the things that are necessary for the thing to continue to be usable.

195
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,241
Scott: Why?

196
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:29,220
Scott: MySQL has been usable without any improvements whatsoever for a long time.

197
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:35,652
Scott: Why would you need any more... That's a stupid thing.

198
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:37,857
Scott: It's like, "You'll never need more than 16

199
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:38,378
Scott: megabytes.".

200
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:38,698
Scott: Right?

201
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:39,620
Scott: The old Bill Gates thing.

202
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,285
Scott: What was it?

203
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:41,517
Rym: "You'll never need more than X amount of

204
00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:41,779
Rym: RAM."

205
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,200
Rym: Which is not really an attributable quote to him, but I digress.

206
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,666
Scott: Right, but the point is that same idea of, "You'll never need more than this,".

207
00:11:49,746 --> 00:11:52,991
Scott: and I'm here saying, "You'll never need more than what MySQL already

208
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:53,151
Scott: has.".

209
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,343
Scott: Exactly, right?

210
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:03,951
Scott: I use MySQL, and I always tell people, "Look, I don't give a shit.

211
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:04,994
Scott: Use MyISAM.

212
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:06,237
Scott: Who gives a shit about data

213
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:06,778
Scott: integrity?".

214
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:09,999
Rym: I do, but I do different things from you.

215
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,963
Scott: Right, that's what I'm saying.

216
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:12,123
Scott: 99%.

217
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:13,766
Scott: I'm willing to go out on a limb.

218
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:21,660
Scott: I'll even say almost everyone who uses MySQL is using it for a non-critical application.

219
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,966
Scott: They're using it for a blog.

220
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:25,940
Scott: They're using it for a website with some sort of CMS.

221
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:38,000
Scott: They're using it for something that is not a bank or a medical machine that is keeping someone alive or a military device or something along that, you know, an airplane.

222
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:40,400
Scott: No one's using MySQL for those serious things.

223
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:47,700
Rym: Some people are using it for high-performance applications, which, again, there are better solutions than MySQL.

224
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:57,380
Scott: Nobody's using MySQL for something that is so ridiculously important to where any of those extra features are going to be something that you need.

225
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:08,300
Scott: If you actually need that extra database stuff, know you need it, and are smart enough to know how to use it and take advantage of it and all that, you're probably going to be using Postgres or Oracle.

226
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,443
Rym: That's what I want to talk about.

227
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:11,926
Rym: Here's what the extensions are.

228
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:18,920
Rym: MySQL Enterprise Security, which allows drop-in external authentication for PAM and LDAP and all that stuff.

229
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,210
Scott: But MySQL authentication that's built in is just fine.

230
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:26,020
Scott: Who actually needs that stuff?

231
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:29,366
Rym: I would say that I do, even for simple MySQL stuff.

232
00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:37,300
Rym: I hate, my entire life, using embedded authentication in any database is a recipe for disaster if you're a company.

233
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,216
Scott: If that's a problem for you, which it isn't for most people, don't use MySQL.

234
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,560
Scott: Don't use some stupid extension.

235
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,652
Rym: Oh yeah, but this extension just does that, which would be a great thing for MySQL.

236
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:50,060
Rym: It would be great if Oracle had just made that and put it in MySQL.

237
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,027
Scott: It would have been okay, but I probably wouldn't have used it.

238
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:55,876
Scott: I'm actually using MySQL 5.1 in all my apps.

239
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,241
Scott: I'm using 5.5.

240
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:01,340
Rym: MySQL Enterprise HA, high availability.

241
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:02,158
Scott: What does that do?

242
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,785
Rym: Clustering and basically master, master.

243
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:09,255
Rym: You've got a database cluster of MySQL that never goes down even if you lose individual nodes.

244
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:11,460
Rym: Failover, failback, all that stuff.

245
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:17,260
Scott: Yeah, anyone who's got a big enough thing to where that unique... The free MySQL can do that in a bunch of ghetto ways.

246
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,672
Rym: Well yeah, I'll tell you guys right now, you want to do master, master on MySQL.

247
00:14:21,953 --> 00:14:22,615
Rym: It's trivial.

248
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,280
Rym: Use the normal binary replication.

249
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,975
Scott: And then do the alternating key trick.

250
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:35,757
Rym: Everywhere the sequence numbers that you're going to use as your keys and such in your simple as database, server number one, the formula for a sequence number is n+1.

251
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,140
Rym: And for the other one, it's just n. So as a result, one server always inserts with evens, one always inserts with odds.

252
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,895
Rym: As long as you don't want to sort based on sequence number, which you're stupid if you do that.

253
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:50,460
Rym: Sort based on a timestamp or something.

254
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:58,360
Scott: Yeah, but also if you want to make that work even better, make your application with the insert only model to where you're only ever inserting and you never update any record ever.

255
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,840
Scott: And you'll be a lot easier.

256
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,148
Rym: Which you may or may not be able to do.

257
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:02,920
Rym: But then again, if you're using that model...

258
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,852
Scott: No, any application, I can design it to where you're doing insert only.

259
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:07,660
Scott: It's possible mathematically.

260
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:10,529
Rym: At the same time, you will have issues with large datasets.

261
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:21,040
Rym: But here's the thing, the datasets that are large enough to where you really want to run into those problems, and I'm working on this stuff a lot right now, is where relational database as a paradigm is not what you need.

262
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:21,620
Scott: Maybe.

263
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,899
Rym: Depending on the data.

264
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:24,100
Scott: Sometimes.

265
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:32,320
Rym: But anyway, the third one is Threadpool, which is a super scalability thing for entertaining large numbers of concurrent connections and things.

266
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,400
Scott: If you actually need any of those things, for real, you really need them, then you should probably pay for them or use Postgres.

267
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:42,889
Rym: Well, what's interesting is that one, Postgres, it's weird.

268
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,914
Rym: The people who complain about Postgres usually say that it's difficult to administer... No, it's not true.

269
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:49,319
Rym: Fuck you.

270
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Rym: It's difficult to install.

271
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,028
Rym: True.

272
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:51,760
Rym: All these things.

273
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,525
Scott: Well, not install, no.

274
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,760
Scott: Install this app, yeah, it's the same install.

275
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,200
Rym: I believed that until I used Postgres extensively and I realized something, because one, I went to RIT.

276
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:03,007
Rym: Kind of a classical IT education.

277
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:06,860
Rym: I had to take this huge track on database design, database administration, all this stuff.

278
00:16:07,962 --> 00:16:11,000
Rym: If you think that Postgres is difficult to configure and you've read the documentation...

279
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:11,600
Scott: You've never used Oracle.

280
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:21,840
Rym: It means that you've never used databases, that your interaction with databases has been confined to MySQL and maybe SQLite.

281
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:22,240
Rym: Yep.

282
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:24,520
Rym: It means that you don't know how databases work.

283
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:25,820
Scott: But that's the thing, right?

284
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:28,479
Rym: But most people don't and I don't expect you to.

285
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:34,600
Rym: If you're making a WordPress, you don't care what the database is, you just want your WordPress to work and MySQL is great for that.

286
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,220
Scott: But no, it's not just you don't know how the databases work, right?

287
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,500
Scott: It's like I know how databases work, right?

288
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,380
Scott: But the point is, is I actually don't need databases, the "real" databases like Postgres and Oracle.

289
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:48,811
Scott: I don't need them to work how they work.

290
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:50,940
Scott: and I know I don't need them to work how they work.

291
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,220
Scott: I want a database that works in a way that pisses off DBAs.

292
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:01,379
Scott: Because every application I write, if I use InnoDB or Postgres, all I get all day, right?

293
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,400
Scott: At least once a day are like validation errors, foreign key mismatch, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

294
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,960
Rym: That means you didn't know your schema.

295
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,500
Scott: Right.

296
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:16,500
Scott: But that's the thing, is that the applications that I am working on are not so important to where any of that shit matters.

297
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:24,460
Scott: That hindrance of me having to constantly fix those data errors all over the place is hindering me from doing "real" work.

298
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,220
Rym: And the fact is, even though those data errors exist... That's your kind of work, a very different model.

299
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,820
Rym: Say you're writing demons that do kind of complex things with, you know, integral data.

300
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:36,000
Scott: Then I'll suddenly care.

301
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,700
Scott: But the point is, most people in the world are doing my kind of work.

302
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,699
Scott: Most people with databases, period, are doing my kind of work only at big companies.

303
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,960
Rym: I would disagree with that.

304
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,440
Rym: I would argue that most people using databases don't even care what a database is.

305
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:51,919
Rym: They just want their application to work.

306
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:54,019
Scott: There are a lot of people like that.

307
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,080
Rym: There are developers who care about the underlying database structure.

308
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:00,840
Rym: But the majority of people have an application they want to use.

309
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,980
Rym: And most applications these days will, if you give it access to a database, will create the schema.

310
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,920
Rym: And the only people who care about the schema are the people who wrote that application and the installer for it.

311
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,580
Rym: And if they care about using Postgres or something, that's great.

312
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,159
Rym: But anyway, there's an ancillary news to this.

313
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,060
Rym: Apple removed MySQL from Lion's server.

314
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:23,197
Rym: Yeah.

315
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:24,840
Rym: I don't know who uses Lion's server.

316
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,900
Scott: You can just install it.

317
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:26,864
Scott: Oh, yeah.

318
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:30,120
Rym: But they replaced it by default with Postgres.

319
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,479
Rym: And I've been saying this for years.

320
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,279
Rym: This is my opportunity to say it again.

321
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:36,839
Rym: Use MySQL if you don't care.

322
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,406
Rym: If you care at all, use Postgres.

323
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:44,500
Rym: because of the open source databases, Postgres is the one that is the best to learn.

324
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:49,739
Rym: It is the future of open databases, as in, in the long run, everything's going to support it.

325
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:56,180
Scott: But even if you do care, if you don't actually need it, it's only going to give you trouble.

326
00:18:56,941 --> 00:19:02,080
Scott: It'll just make more work for you, even though you might be OCD and you really want to do all that extra work.

327
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,100
Scott: Even if you care about databases, because I do care, it's just that I know I don't need it.

328
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,191
Scott: So if I try to get it, all it does is create extra work.

329
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:14,500
Scott: that is no benefit for me in my particular use case.

330
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:20,440
Scott: So only do that extra work on the Postgres if it's actually going to benefit you because your application needs it.

331
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,360
Rym: Well, it depends.

332
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:26,620
Rym: Very few people are actually application developers like you who are using databases.

333
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,520
Rym: Most people are probably installing a database to then have some other application someone else wrote built on top of it.

334
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,440
Rym: And what I'm saying is that more and more of those applications are going to support Postgres and/or MySQL.

335
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:40,378
Scott: I don't see that.

336
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:43,680
Rym: Postgres support is growing in a surprising number of things.

337
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,540
Rym: And especially if you want a job out there, especially in like an IT thing.

338
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,640
Scott: Yeah, if you want a job working at a financial or something serious.

339
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,044
Rym: No, not financial.

340
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:52,953
Rym: I'm saying in general.

341
00:19:53,013 --> 00:19:53,720
Rym: Forget developers.

342
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,660
Rym: If you're like an IT guy, more and more people are going to be saying we need a Postgres database.

343
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,600
Rym: And if you can do the stuff to administer a Postgres database.

344
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,004
Scott: Depending on the industry.

345
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:08,120
Scott: If you go to Silicon Valley where people are just making social nonsense.

346
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,320
Rym: If you're going to be there, you've got to know NoSQL bullshit because they're all going to want that because that's a hot thing.

347
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,140
Scott: That's what I'm saying is that if you are working on, you know, it depends on the industry entirely.

348
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:23,140
Scott: If you are working on an application, whether you're a developer or a database guy or an IT guy, that is serious.

349
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:26,340
Scott: You're going to need to know Postgres, Oracle, something serious.

350
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:31,880
Scott: If you're working on trivial stuff that no one cares about, like lol, I got a site with funny cat pictures.

351
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,720
Rym: But Scott, simultaneously, if you're an IT guy, and when I say IT, I mean real IT that actually pays real money.

352
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,140
Scott: Yeah, companies that do have...

353
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,260
Rym: No one's ever going to ask you to use MySQL.

354
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:44,159
Rym: If they do, you're probably on the wrong track of IT.

355
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,665
Scott: That's true.

356
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:45,339
Scott: That is true because...

357
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,300
Rym: Because MySQL is something that a developer can administer trivially.

358
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,040
Scott: If you are a funny cat picture website, you probably don't have IT people.

359
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,923
Rym: Yeah, so this is what I'm saying.

360
00:20:55,044 --> 00:21:01,540
Rym: If you are an IT person, it behooves you to learn Postgres because you will run afoul of it more and more and more.

361
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,129
Rym: And it is not difficult.

362
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,815
Rym: It is not hard to use.

363
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:06,980
Rym: It's not hard to configure.

364
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:09,560
Scott: It is harder than MySQL.

365
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:10,704
Rym: Well, here's the difference.

366
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:13,254
Rym: MySQL just kind of works magically.

367
00:21:13,595 --> 00:21:14,860
Rym: Postgres has real security.

368
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,554
Scott: No, MySQL doesn't work magically.

369
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:18,560
Scott: It just says...

370
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,512
Rym: You install it and it says, "What's the root

371
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,679
Rym: password?".

372
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:27,600
Scott: Well, yeah, but basically the thing that makes MySQL easier is that it just doesn't care if your shit is fucked up.

373
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,119
Scott: It'll still give you a result.

374
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,238
Rym: The other thing, like what I use Postgres for...

375
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,220
Scott: Postgres will let you know you're doing something wrong, and when you do something wrong, it'll smack you and it won't give you anything.

376
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,239
Rym: It gives you a lot more than nothing.

377
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,909
Scott: It gives you an error message.

378
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,860
Scott: It forces you to do things the right way.

379
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:47,220
Rym: I realize we're having an argument that half these people don't even understand.

380
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:54,400
Rym: So the deal is that by default, if you just use MySQL, you don't know what you're doing, it's not transactional in the way that Oracle or Postgres is.

381
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,979
Rym: So talking to MySQL, I say, "Insert foo into bar table," or something like that.

382
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:01,489
Rym: And it just says, "Okay,".

383
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,820
Rym: or maybe it crashes or something.

384
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,400
Rym: It doesn't crash.

385
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:04,219
Rym: It can crash.

386
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:04,980
Scott: I've never seen it crash.

387
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:05,780
Rym: I've seen it crash before.

388
00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:06,539
Scott: In my entire life.

389
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,300
Rym: I've seen it crash when people inserted control characters into a, like, they did weird stuff with what was going into the database.

390
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,157
Scott: I've never seen that happen.

391
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,280
Rym: But Postgres, you'll say something like, "Begin," meaning I'm beginning a transaction.

392
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,931
Rym: And then one or more SQL statements, maybe 10,000 SQL statements.

393
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,260
Rym: Though, by default, if you don't know what you're doing, every individual statement will have its own begin/commit block.

394
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:30,740
Rym: So you begin a statement.

395
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,185
Rym: So I say,

396
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:31,511
Rym: "Begin.".

397
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:35,820
Rym: Then I say, "Insert foo into bar table," and then it'll succeed or fail.

398
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,520
Rym: If it succeeds, it does the next command, and it keeps doing them until you've done all your commands.

399
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:48,672
Rym: Then you can do selects and anything you want against the database as though all of your -- so you've basically got your own shard of the database.

400
00:22:49,053 --> 00:22:53,220
Rym: that is the same as the original database plus all the changes you made to the database.

401
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:57,440
Rym: But if you then back out without committing, all those changes disappear.

402
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:00,400
Rym: Or you say, "Commit," and then all those changes are written.

403
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:08,840
Rym: So if you care about data integrity, which, you know, that sounds like something you should always care about, but as Scott has said, many times you actually don't care.

404
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,100
Rym: So if you think you care, it might be worthwhile to try to figure out if you actually do care, because there's a good chance you don't.

405
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,900
Scott: Yeah, if you're a bank, you really care that you deposited the money before the other guy would draw the money.

406
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,880
Rym: Here's an example.

407
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,080
Rym: Let's say you want to add a column to a table.

408
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:27,755
Rym: Okay.

409
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,260
Rym: Let's say you want to insert a row into a database.

410
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,280
Rym: Like, you want to do something where you're doing something that is against the schema you already have in place.

411
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:45,180
Rym: Like, you have a foreign key relationship where this kind of record cannot be inserted without this foreign key to this other table.

412
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:52,640
Rym: Postgres will not let you interact with that in any way unless you know exactly what the schema is, and it works.

413
00:23:53,140 --> 00:24:02,560
Rym: If you do something, like, if you try to remove a database and there's a relationship with another table or anything weird, it'll fail, and then all your statements after that will fail, and you have to do things in the proper order.

414
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:16,200
Rym: MySQL will be like, "Okay, whatever, just do it," even though you might end up with, for example, a database record that's active that has an entry pointing to another table, that that entry doesn't exist anymore in that table.

415
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,660
Scott: Because who cares?

416
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,679
Rym: Yep, you might not care, or you might care.

417
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:24,440
Rym: There's a lot of easy ways to write an application where it'll crash if it can't find what it's looking for.

418
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,620
Rym: You get a null pointer or something.

419
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:36,040
Scott: Yeah, personally, it's just a matter of, you know, if you're big enough to have DBAs, right, then suddenly, you know, a lot of people put all sorts of functionality in the database, right?

420
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,360
Scott: Like, stored procedures and all that kind of crazy nonsense.

421
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:43,280
Scott: But most people are going to have 100% of their functionality and logic in their application.

422
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:49,296
Scott: Yep, so where's- And the database is just a dumb store of data and doesn't need any extra stuff except, "Store my data.

423
00:24:49,397 --> 00:24:49,999
Scott: Give me my data,

424
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:50,219
Scott: bitch.".

425
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:52,520
Rym: No, sometimes you want the database to be smart.

426
00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:07,860
Rym: Usually, for example, if you're dealing with archives, you're dealing with, you know, say you want to keep a record of every order you've ever done in some, like, I don't know, e-commerce system for the previous five years, then you'll want a fairly reliable record of this.

427
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,496
Rym: You'll want to make sure that data doesn't get into the database.

428
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:11,039
Rym: that's fucked up.

429
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:11,760
Scott: That's true.

430
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,980
Rym: And that's when- so Postgres is good for all that sort of stuff.

431
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,540
Rym: Anyway- But really, Postgres is going to be used more and more, and you should learn it.

432
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,400
Scott: It'll be used more by people who are abandoning Oracle and need something serious.

433
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:27,680
Rym: Or people who are abandoning MySQL because they're nerds.

434
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,780
Scott: Yeah, but I think those people might go to the drizzles of the world anyway.

435
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,402
Rym: I don't know.

436
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:36,500
Rym: I don't know if they will because most of the IT people I run into actually don't know about any of those projects.

437
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,880
Scott: Those are IT people, I'm saying.

438
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,240
Rym: I know, I'm saying, but as a result, there's going to be a drive toward Postgres.

439
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,060
Scott: But nerds know about it, is what I'm saying.

440
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:43,454
Rym: Yeah.

441
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,560
Rym: The thing is, it surprises me how many nerds have a lot of trouble getting Postgres configured.

442
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,880
Rym: It's way better documented.

443
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:55,540
Scott: App get install, then you change the pghba file, and then that's it.

444
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,939
Rym: Eh, there's a little more to it.

445
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:57,720
Scott: What else you got to do?

446
00:25:57,981 --> 00:25:58,820
Rym: Depends on what you're doing.

447
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,800
Scott: Anyway, so, in other news, that was incredibly long news.

448
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:09,739
Scott: So, did you know that about a month ago, or maybe a little over a month ago, kernel.org, where the Linux kernel was hosted, was haxed?

449
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:10,719
Rym: Oh shit, son.

450
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,318
Rym: Did you know that?

451
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:12,279
Rym: Ah, yes I did.

452
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:12,777
Scott: Okay.

453
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,460
Rym: I read Slashdot like everybody.

454
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,880
Scott: So now here's something that is, you know, what's incredibly dismaying is not the fact that it was haxed.

455
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,600
Scott: You can read all about the hax itself and what happened on the internet, so you don't need me to tell you.

456
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,179
Scott: And I don't really care, that's not the interesting part.

457
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,740
Scott: The part that I want to talk about is the fact that if you go to kernel.org today, over a month after this happened, what does it say?

458
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,680
Scott: It says fucking maintenance down for maintenance.

459
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:35,818
Scott: Are you shitting me?

460
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:36,752
Scott: Right?

461
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,780
Scott: You are taking care of the Linux kernel, right?

462
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,960
Scott: You are Linus Torvalds and friends.

463
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:45,839
Scott: You are making this piece of software that, you know, the world depends on.

464
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,453
Scott: Right?

465
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:47,280
Scott: It's open source.

466
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:47,978
Scott: That's true.

467
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:49,720
Scott: You know, you're giving it out for free.

468
00:26:49,882 --> 00:26:50,297
Scott: It's true.

469
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:55,100
Scott: But you're such experts that we're gonna, you know, you're doing most of the work, right?

470
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,520
Scott: You and the Red Hat guys and the Nvidia guys, right?

471
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,298
Scott: And the IBM guys.

472
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:03,580
Scott: And you can't bring a fucking website back up in like a month?

473
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,331
Scott: Are you kidding me?

474
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,879
Scott: Like how dumb are these people?

475
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:10,980
Scott: It's like they're experts at kernels and operating systems.

476
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,379
Rym: You know why?

477
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:12,280
Rym: I'm gonna tell you why.

478
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,840
Rym: Here's my guess.

479
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,080
Scott: Go to Linode, boom!

480
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,231
Scott: Buy a Linode, put Apache on it.

481
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,179
Rym: Here's my guess.

482
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,639
Rym: Here's my guess.

483
00:27:20,242 --> 00:27:28,660
Rym: One, they're running Apache and they have tweaked the ever-living shit out of it with the kinds of parameters that normal IT people don't even know about.

484
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,560
Scott: Don't bring back up the original site.

485
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:30,998
Rym: No, no, Scott.

486
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,820
Scott: Because obviously it was broken as shit.

487
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,070
Scott: Just bring up a brand new one.

488
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,260
Rym: that's nothing like the old one.

489
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,139
Rym: So they've got that and all this legacy stuff in there.

490
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,680
Rym: And their mindset is we've got to get everything back the way it was.

491
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,240
Scott: But meanwhile, they've been using GitHub for like over a month.

492
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:49,680
Scott: And actually, from what they've said, they're actually not too unhappy with GitHub.

493
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:58,700
Scott: So, but it's like, this is causing me serious problems because I'll try to look up the Git documentation, which was hosted on kernel.org, and now it's not there anymore.

494
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:00,940
Scott: So it's all, it fell out of the Google results.

495
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:09,000
Rym: Scott, here's my other guess is that they probably didn't do their database backups the way they should have because they're probably not actually IT people.

496
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,180
Scott: I don't think there is a database.

497
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,580
Scott: It's mostly an FTP server and like a static HTML, isn't it?

498
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,759
Scott: I don't think there's much database going on.

499
00:28:15,982 --> 00:28:16,730
Rym: It's not a site.

500
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,780
Rym: I generally peruse that often.

501
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,917
Scott: But like the way they had it set up before, apparently like all these people had tons of SSH keys to get into it.

502
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:24,178
Scott: And it was like, what?

503
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,300
Rym: My guess is that there's so much legacy bullshit that they don't know.

504
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,740
Rym: Like they're probably just sorting through like this massive horrible configuration.

505
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,719
Scott: You can do that.

506
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:38,999
Scott: Keep that horrible thing off to the side offline where you can sort through it and bring up a new server that has nothing to do with the old one.

507
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,799
Rym: Scott, this is- Take five minutes.

508
00:28:41,243 --> 00:28:43,520
Rym: It's because they're computer scientists.

509
00:28:43,642 --> 00:28:44,739
Rym: They're not IT people.

510
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:56,240
Scott: But it just, you know, this is, I just wanted to bring this up as a typical example of people who are extremely competent in one area being extremely unconfident in another area, selves included, right?

511
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:12,939
Scott: You know, but, you know, often in the world you will have like people who are experts at something who will then, you know, say something about an area in which they are not an expert, but they will come with authority because they are an expert in a related or similar area, and many people will believe them or trust them.

512
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,497
Rym: But at least in this case, they have not said anything like, "We're awesome system

513
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:17,140
Rym: administrators.".

514
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:28,858
Scott: No, but I just wanted to show you because an example of, to prove that, you know, for example, a doctor might not have the best, you know, who is an expert at, say, hearts, don't listen to him when it comes to, say, stomachs.

515
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,840
Scott: You know, just because he's a doctor doesn't mean you know everything about doctoring.

516
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,104
Scott: Just because he's a computer.

517
00:29:33,124 --> 00:29:37,560
Scott: people who are experts at kernel writing, right, and source code management.

518
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:37,977
Rym: Yep.

519
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,800
Scott: But they don't know shit about websites.

520
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,340
Rym: Don't listen to me if you're trying to figure out the security structure for your complex application.

521
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,980
Scott: Or security, apparently, because they got hacked.

522
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:50,860
Rym: I mean, you've seen old documentation.

523
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,279
Rym: Look at the NTP website.

524
00:29:59,301 --> 00:30:03,400
Rym: So things of the day, I don't believe I've used this before, but there's a tiny chance.

525
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:04,379
Rym: I did, but I couldn't find it.

526
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:10,779
Rym: But so I'm doing this because it's stuck in my head, and I also want it to be stuck in your head.

527
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:20,207
Rym: This is a pretty great video that showcases how bad He-Man was, how bad He-Man was, and how funny He-Man is.

528
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:24,097
Rym: when you add homoerotic undertones and use the fact that- You have to add them?

529
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,180
Scott: Or are you saying add more homoerotic undertones?

530
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:27,978
Rym: Highlight them.

531
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,475
Rym: Okay.

532
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:37,558
Rym: Mostly it's that He-Man has a surprising number of kind of sad expressions that are really funny, and I don't know.

533
00:30:38,064 --> 00:30:38,379
Rym: You'll see.

534
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,340
Rym: This will be stuck in your head.

535
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,499
Rym: You're going to hate me for like a month.

536
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,517
Rym: I have no regrets.

537
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:50,346
Scott: All right, so here's a video called "Scale," and basically the deal in this video is.

538
00:30:50,406 --> 00:31:06,149
Scott: he shows you what the sky would look like if various other celestial bodies were as close to the Earth as the moon is.

539
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:16,049
Scott: So for example, if Mars was at the same position as the moon is, it would be X big in the sky, and he visualizes this.

540
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,670
Scott: So it's like, oh, Mars would look like about four to six to maybe eight moons most, right?

541
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,908
Scott: It'd be pretty big out there.

542
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:25,267
Scott: And then he shows you what the Earth would look like in the Earth's sky, which is kind of funny.

543
00:31:26,335 --> 00:31:27,250
Scott: And then he goes to Jupiter.

544
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,141
Scott: Now the thing is, is he measuring from the-?

545
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:48,963
Scott: Is he putting the center of Jupiter on the center of the moon and measuring it that way, or is he putting a tangential line to the side of Jupiter and putting it at that spot?

546
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:56,424
Scott: Because I'm pretty sure that if you put the center of Jupiter at the center of the moon, the Earth would be in Jupiter, right?

547
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,650
Scott: You wouldn't be able to see Jupiter.

548
00:31:59,112 --> 00:32:01,390
Scott: You would be on the surface.

549
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,110
Scott: I guess you wouldn't be on the surface.

550
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:05,310
Rym: Well, have you calculated all those distances?

551
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:12,660
Scott: I didn't actually go to Wikipedia to look it up, but I would be willing to bet a dollar that if the center of Jupiter was at-.

552
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:21,589
Scott: If you teleported Jupiter right now so that the center of Jupiter was in the same spot as the center of the moon is at this second, the Earth would be inside of Jupiter.

553
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:22,990
Scott: Definitely.

554
00:32:23,214 --> 00:32:23,768
Scott: It's that big.

555
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:24,770
Scott: There's no question.

556
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:29,907
Scott: Not to mention the fact that gravity would pull Jupiter into the sun and there would be all kinds of crazy shit going on.

557
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:37,690
Rym: So, very briefly, in the meta moment, the GeekNights' worst webcomic contest is closed to submissions.

558
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:38,593
Scott: No.

559
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,290
Rym: We're reading all that godawful furry porn you've sent us.

560
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,670
Scott: And the episode will be in a couple days.

561
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:46,890
Rym: Yes, it'll be on Wednesday.

562
00:32:48,352 --> 00:32:49,469
Rym: There's some winners in there.

563
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,029
Scott: There's also some losers.

564
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,509
Rym: There's some good stuff in there.

565
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,170
Scott: Losers and winners in the worst contest.

566
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:56,329
Rym: Yep.

567
00:32:56,791 --> 00:33:01,810
Rym: If you're going to be at the New York Comic Con and you want to say hi, let us know and we'll tell you when we're going to be there.

568
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,650
Rym: We're going to be there as press and professionals.

569
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,110
Scott: I'm going to be there casually.

570
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:12,309
Rym: We're not doing any panels because the options for doing shows at the con to- We'll talk about it when we review it.

571
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:23,389
Rym: But basically, instead of a panel room for us doing panels, let's say, there's a stage, as in that same stage where stormtroopers fight with each other.

572
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:31,890
Rym: They're definitely leaning more towards the- Panels purchased by publishers who want to say that they had a press release in a panel.

573
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:33,149
Scott: Right, but here's the thing that I understand.

574
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:34,870
Scott: We'll talk about it more later.

575
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,067
Scott: I just want to say this right now.

576
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:43,729
Scott: Even San Diego Comic Con has small rooms somewhere with fan panels because they know people who are on those fan panels.

577
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:45,810
Scott: So, New York Comic Con, what the fuck?

578
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:46,190
Scott: Anyway.

579
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:47,569
Rym: Yeah, well, we'll see.

580
00:33:48,512 --> 00:33:50,290
Rym: We'll review the convention objectively.

581
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,870
Rym: It just saddens me that like- You know what the badge has on it?

582
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,468
Scott: I got the badge.

583
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:55,269
Scott: You know what it says?

584
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,806
Scott: It has a Walking Dead TV ad.

585
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,889
Scott: It takes up the majority of the badge.

586
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,330
Rym: They don't mail press badges.

587
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,350
Rym: I have to go pick mine up at the con.

588
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:03,809
Scott: Awful.

589
00:34:04,231 --> 00:34:04,970
Rym: But I get to go Thursday.

590
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:05,768
Scott: Great.

591
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,789
Rym: Emily's got a professional badge.

592
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:08,790
Rym: Ooh.

593
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:12,525
Rym: Remember how we used to always get the professional badge because they didn't know what badge to give us?

594
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:13,190
Scott: Whatever.

595
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:15,230
Rym: So, we'll see.

596
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,030
Rym: It's sad as a meta thing how PAX seems to be the only con that can do it right.

597
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,130
Rym: Though, of course, right under PAX is like Kinetic Con and Magfest.

598
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:26,469
Rym: But- Speaking of Magfest- Magfest is coming.

599
00:34:27,553 --> 00:34:28,370
Scott: Get your shit ready.

600
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:34,250
Rym: Yeah, guys, if you want to go to Magfest, get your hotel room now before it sells out.

601
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:36,830
Rym: All right.

602
00:34:37,212 --> 00:34:38,530
Rym: I'm so excited about Magfest.

603
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,190
Scott: Remember, Magfest is not a convention.

604
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:40,947
Scott: It's a fest.

605
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:44,043
Rym: And we will be there doing at least one of our panels.

606
00:34:44,205 --> 00:34:45,570
Rym: in addition- well, lectures, I guess.

607
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,429
Scott: It's also four days.

608
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,270
Rym: And we're going to be on the Mag-9 again, the gaming intellectuals.

609
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:53,770
Scott: We can't talk about it much yet, but much like last year- Well, it might be the Mag-10 because it's the 10th Magfest.

610
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:59,789
Rym: Where we've got- well, originally I think it was nine gaming intellectuals, but I think we have like 14 intellectuals now, so I don't know.

611
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,569
Rym: But, bunch of smart people in the gaming industry, including the right honorable Dr.

612
00:35:04,609 --> 00:35:05,890
Rym: Hazard, who has the best name ever.

613
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:10,090
Scott: The 10th Annual Music and Gaming Festival, four days of non-stop games and concerts.

614
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:10,569
Scott: That's right.

615
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,650
Scott: Four days, non-stop, hotel, all night, Thursday morning through Sunday night.

616
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:23,290
Rym: So, many of you come to like the Penny Arcade Expo or Anime Boston and you want to hang out, and you might notice that we disappear from our panels and we're often busy.

617
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:24,470
Rym: Magfest?

618
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:26,769
Rym: We don't do shit.

619
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,010
Rym: You want to just hang out and get drunk and play games for a whole weekend with us?

620
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:31,228
Rym: That's where you want to do it.

621
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:35,310
Scott: Also, 11-11-11, the burning apocalypse con.

622
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,082
Scott: Registration is now open.

623
00:35:38,572 --> 00:35:40,570
Rym: Now, I point out, this is one of those cons.

624
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,630
Rym: Well, one of those cons.

625
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,710
Rym: It's a special kind of con.

626
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,809
Rym: You want to go, you have to play in games.

627
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,390
Rym: You also run a game.

628
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,030
Scott: You must run one game to be at the convention.

629
00:35:50,471 --> 00:35:53,370
Scott: I'm going to run an inspector's game because I think I'll be the only one.

630
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,206
Scott: It has to be a-.

631
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,330
Rym: No, it said very specifically, you can also say other and say what the game is.

632
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:07,730
Scott: No, he said that he's going to email people who chose a game that was not a Luke Crane or a Vince Baker game.

633
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:09,850
Rym: Then I'll unregister because I don't feel like running Burning Wheel.

634
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:10,950
Scott: You're just not going to go?

635
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:13,050
Rym: I'll go to say hi and video stuff.

636
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,710
Rym: I just won't play any games because I don't want to run any Burning Wheel.

637
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,688
Rym: I just don't feel it.

638
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,648
Scott: It's just two days of RPGing.

639
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,368
Rym: Constant RPGing.

640
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,749
Scott: That's it in New York.

641
00:36:24,512 --> 00:36:24,890
Scott: There you go.

642
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:25,690
Rym: Yep.

643
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,890
Rym: Also, PAX is coming up in about six months.

644
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:29,389
Rym: We'll be there.

645
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,009
Scott: Right, we're done.

646
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:38,990
Rym: Many of you might be too young to remember, but there was a time before Google really picked up Steam and when AltaVista was kind of the best search engine.

647
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:39,589
Scott: Or WebCrawler.

648
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:40,630
Rym: Or Yahoo.

649
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:42,989
Scott: Or Lycos.

650
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,650
Rym: Lycos, oh shit.

651
00:36:44,771 --> 00:36:47,110
Rym: Or the people who go to Dogpile that searched all the other search engines.

652
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:47,968
Scott: Searched everything at once.

653
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:53,790
Rym: A problem you run into is that on any search engine, you search for something.

654
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:59,670
Rym: A good 40% of the links on the front page would just be broken.

655
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:07,270
Rym: Imagine if today you went to Google and you searched for Nyan Cat and the first three links were all just dead.

656
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:07,795
Rym: They were 404s.

657
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,149
Scott: Yeah, I mean sometimes you might, depending on what you're searching for, you might get these squatting sites.

658
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:18,209
Scott: But Google's actually been pretty good about getting rid of those out of the top of the search results in most cases.

659
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,350
Scott: But imagine if just almost all the links were dead.

660
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:23,950
Scott: And you search for something obvious.

661
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:29,519
Scott: You search Mega Man 2 and you go and you just keep clicking links and almost all the ones that look like they're good are 404s.

662
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,389
Scott: You just keep going and they're all 404s.

663
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:39,985
Rym: You get to the point where, and worse, you go to a website and people back then used to have on every website, they'd have like a links page that was just links to other shit.

664
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:42,130
Rym: And the majority of those would be broken.

665
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,830
Rym: Maybe you'd be following a web ring.

666
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:44,721
Scott: Web ring, baby.

667
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,248
Rym: Web ring.

668
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,886
Rym: But then you'd hit a piece of the web ring that's gone.

669
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:49,470
Rym: and now what?

670
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,789
Scott: Now you have to go back to the previous page.

671
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,069
Rym: And then figure out how to skip.

672
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:58,230
Scott: And then use the random function on the web ring to get somewhere else and hope you can get to the other half of the ring.

673
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:03,649
Rym: Or if you were really lucky, maybe you could figure out from the URL like the number of the next link.

674
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,909
Scott: We should bring back web rings.

675
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:05,929
Rym: Maybe we should.

676
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,209
Scott: Would anyone use them?

677
00:38:08,312 --> 00:38:13,790
Rym: I don't think anyone surfs the web anymore so much as Google's a word and YouTube and looks for videos of that thing.

678
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,529
Scott: Yeah, but if you're just bored on the internet, right?

679
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,109
Rym: What do you do?

680
00:38:16,372 --> 00:38:17,729
Rym: You click on Wikipedia links.

681
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,239
Scott: Yeah.

682
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:19,308
Rym: Or TV Tropes.

683
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:23,080
Scott: If you could get into like a pony web ring, you'd just keep clicking next, next, next, next.

684
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:24,390
Rym: You'd hit so much porn.

685
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:25,430
Rym: I'm just saying.

686
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,389
Rym: It'd be all porn.

687
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:27,270
Rym: Anyway.

688
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,165
Rym: Clop fiction, I guess is what they call it.

689
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:30,861
Scott: Anyway.

690
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:39,802
Rym: Anyway, so this was a problem that was solved a long time ago in that we have codes for "My shit isn't here

691
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:40,327
Rym: anymore."

692
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:46,330
Rym: And theoretically, you could make stuff on the internet, use that information to route around problems.

693
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:47,329
Rym: But we never really did that.

694
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,005
Scott: Well, I just remembered StumbleUpon is what- Oh, yeah.

695
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,110
Scott: Is web ring.

696
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:51,450
Scott: Anyway.

697
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:55,250
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know how you get the 404 not found, right?

698
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,383
Scott: So there's all these different messages websites are supposed to send in the form of numbers, 200 means, "Hello, I'm a web

699
00:39:01,404 --> 00:39:01,646
Scott: page.".

700
00:39:01,646 --> 00:39:10,467
Scott: 404 means not found, as in, "You visited a URL that hit my web server, but I don't have anything at that URL on this web

701
00:39:10,508 --> 00:39:10,770
Scott: server.".

702
00:39:10,912 --> 00:39:11,950
Scott: So that's not found.

703
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,868
Scott: I don't know what the fuck that is.

704
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,647
Scott: Then there's other ones like, I think it's 405, I'm guessing, is gone.

705
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,969
Scott: Meaning, "There used to be something here.

706
00:39:19,472 --> 00:39:19,553
Scott: It's

707
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:19,959
Scott: gone.".

708
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,221
Scott: And then there's 302, which is like, "Redirect.

709
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,847
Scott: Go here instead from now

710
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:25,029
Scott: on.".

711
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,630
Rym: Now, there's different kinds of redirects, temporary, all that stuff.

712
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,790
Scott: Yeah, there's temporary redirect, permanent redirect, there's all these different instructions.

713
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:37,985
Scott: So you can always, you know, your computer can talk to the web server and figure out, "I'm going to this URL.

714
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,209
Scott: That's where I think there's some stuff I'm looking for.

715
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:42,143
Scott: What happened to it if it's not there

716
00:39:42,184 --> 00:39:42,506
Scott: anymore?".

717
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:48,930
Rym: So the trouble is that we kind of solved this problem for a long time, that link rot kind of reached this critical mass.

718
00:39:49,652 --> 00:39:51,810
Rym: And then it sort of went away for a while.

719
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:55,409
Rym: And if you link to stuff, you could pretty much rely on that link being there.

720
00:39:56,752 --> 00:39:59,930
Scott: Or you could at least go to the Google cache or something, or the Wayback Machine.

721
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:12,883
Rym: So as time has gone on, I've found that people for a long time ago used to complain that, you know, when I do the news links for GeekNights, I almost always link to things like Fark or Slashdot or some sort of aggregator.

722
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:14,790
Rym: that itself links to the content.

723
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:24,450
Rym: And I point out that those sites are by and large the only goddamn sites that still have any vestige of the original content I wanted to link to in the first place.

724
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,667
Scott: Yeah, I can go get a Slashdot story from fucking '99.

725
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,570
Scott: It'll still be on that site somewhere.

726
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,130
Rym: Now all the links from that are probably broken, but at least the summary's there.

727
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,350
Rym: There's some sort of proof that, yes, there may have been an article at one point.

728
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,629
Rym: Rym wasn't just making this up.

729
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,130
Scott: Yep.

730
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,261
Scott: But if you had linked directly to that article, then...

731
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,510
Rym: It's probably gone.

732
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,269
Scott: Yeah, so good luck.

733
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,750
Rym: They go behind paywalls.

734
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,390
Rym: People just change domains.

735
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,510
Rym: They move stuff around.

736
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:47,569
Scott: People will change.

737
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:48,450
Scott: Here's another thing.

738
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,030
Scott: People will change the URLs on their site.

739
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:53,408
Scott: And maybe sometimes they actually care about redirecting, so they'll put up redirects.

740
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,610
Scott: But then later they take the redirects away.

741
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,270
Scott: So I have a blog post.

742
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,089
Scott: My blog post links to your news website, Rym, right?

743
00:41:00,511 --> 00:41:04,467
Scott: You change all your URLs when you relaunch your site, and you put up redirects like a good boy.

744
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:10,169
Scott: But my site never actually goes out and checks all these URLs to update them.

745
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:18,565
Scott: So eventually someday you remove your redirects when you relaunch the second time, because you get two clicks on those old URLs.

746
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:19,870
Scott: you're looking and making sure.

747
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:21,129
Scott: So you get rid of them.

748
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,630
Scott: But meanwhile, my blog post still links to that incredibly old URL pattern.

749
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,270
Scott: Or never mind.

750
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,310
Rym: My website's fine.

751
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,369
Rym: And then I die of old age.

752
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:29,037
Scott: Oh.

753
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:29,887
Rym: Now what?

754
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:30,810
Rym: Domain expires.

755
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,549
Rym: There's a squatting site there now.

756
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:33,643
Scott: Or you link to kernel.org.

757
00:41:34,354 --> 00:41:34,545
Scott: Yep.

758
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:38,990
Scott: Which went down, so it can't even serve... And not even serving redirects or anything like that.

759
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:47,010
Rym: And it's a problem I'd ignore for a while, because I kind of... The way I use the internet now is I'm never looking at old things ever.

760
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:48,328
Rym: Not old links.

761
00:41:49,392 --> 00:41:52,829
Rym: If I look at a link, it's because someone sent it to me on Twitter in the last hour.

762
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:56,909
Rym: But we have a thing of the day feed.

763
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,070
Rym: We tweet out every day some random old thing of the day.

764
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:06,690
Rym: I would say that a good 60% of the things of the day we have ever picked in the lifetime of GeekNights is fucking gone.

765
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,029
Scott: Now here's the thing.

766
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,549
Scott: You think, "Why don't you do something about

767
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:10,650
Scott: that?".

768
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,270
Scott: Well, we did.

769
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:11,829
Scott: I have.

770
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:18,509
Scott: I actually wrote a bunch of code that checks to see if various things of the day are 404 or timed out.

771
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:29,610
Scott: Meaning, A, if the web server that it's pointing to no longer exists, or if it's a 404 or a 400 gone or whatever it is, then fucking don't tweet that shit.

772
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,230
Scott: Also, if there's a redirect, update that shit.

773
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,410
Scott: So I'm actually checking for these things.

774
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:36,109
Scott: But you know what?

775
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,650
Scott: I've run into some worse problems.

776
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:40,729
Scott: Number one, there's almost no things of the day left to tweet out.

777
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:45,287
Scott: Two, is that a lot of times you'll get a 200 response.

778
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,760
Scott: It'll be like, "Yeah, I'm

779
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:46,902
Scott: here.".

780
00:42:47,553 --> 00:42:48,329
Scott: And I'll be like, "Oh, cool.

781
00:42:49,154 --> 00:42:49,766
Scott: That's a good thing of the

782
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:49,868
Scott: day.".

783
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,730
Rym: Yes, but all right, so we follow that link and a human looks at it.

784
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,750
Rym: It's either a domain squatter because the domain's gone.

785
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,951
Scott: But the domain squatter isn't giving you a redirect or a 404.

786
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,530
Scott: They're giving you their page.

787
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,487
Scott: They're like, "Here's the page you want, my squatting page, full

788
00:43:03,507 --> 00:43:03,749
Scott: heads.".

789
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:05,830
Rym: Fuck domain squatters, but I digress.

790
00:43:06,112 --> 00:43:08,370
Scott: Even worse, you'll go to something like YouTube.

791
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:09,969
Scott: And it's like, "Oh, cool.

792
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,667
Scott: YouTube, that's a reliable link as all

793
00:43:11,707 --> 00:43:11,869
Scott: hell.".

794
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,890
Scott: Nope, content removed by user.

795
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,210
Scott: Content removed by user.

796
00:43:16,174 --> 00:43:17,770
Scott: It used to be public, now it's private.

797
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,309
Scott: Content removed because of copyright.

798
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,450
Scott: Google, why aren't you returning a 404 for that shit?

799
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,191
Scott: You're still returning a 200.

800
00:43:24,191 --> 00:43:25,630
Scott: Now I'm linking to something useless.

801
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:26,790
Scott: Great, thanks.

802
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,610
Rym: Well, because think about this from a design perspective.

803
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,310
Rym: If they ignore this problem, a 404 is scary to most people.

804
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:34,025
Rym: They don't want to see that.

805
00:43:34,472 --> 00:43:42,145
Scott: They want to see the webpage, so they see-- They can just make the 404 page display that, but still return the 404 status result.

806
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:44,390
Scott: Why don't they do that?

807
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,590
Rym: Because only people like us care.

808
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,910
Scott: Only people like us care.

809
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,410
Rym: You, me, and Tim Berners-Lee.

810
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:54,390
Scott: This is what happens when you got podcasts that runs for like five, six years, is you build up all these links to news and things of the day.

811
00:43:55,011 --> 00:43:56,750
Scott: Most of that shit doesn't work anymore.

812
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,290
Scott: And really, the amount of work it would take to fix would be enormous.

813
00:44:01,132 --> 00:44:02,502
Scott: And the benefit would be none.

814
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:11,590
Rym: Now, we could, as a community, as a tech community, Tim Berners-Lee it and come up with a solution, like a way to fix this generally.

815
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,590
Scott: I could link to the Google cache or the Wayback Machine, which would take care of some of it.

816
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,810
Rym: See, now here's an interesting thing.

817
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:20,549
Rym: We don't have a technological global solution of redirects and things that--.

818
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,010
Scott: Yeah, you know how Google keeps the 404s out of its results?

819
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,890
Scott: It just removes those from the results.

820
00:44:25,094 --> 00:44:25,182
Scott: Yep.

821
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:25,813
Scott: Right?

822
00:44:26,015 --> 00:44:32,029
Scott: It's just like if I have a website, if I take frontendgrid.com offline and you search for GeekNights tomorrow, it just won't show up at all.

823
00:44:32,151 --> 00:44:32,696
Scott: You won't get the 404s.

824
00:44:32,716 --> 00:44:33,140
Scott: You won't see us.

825
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:35,847
Scott: You'll see other stuff that's not us.

826
00:44:36,972 --> 00:44:38,001
Scott: That's how Google makes it.

827
00:44:38,021 --> 00:44:38,344
Scott: so there's no 404s.

828
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:40,850
Scott: That doesn't solve the problem.

829
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,550
Rym: There's no universal solution, like a technological one.

830
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,210
Rym: But we could easily get around it.

831
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:49,490
Rym: Every person could make their own individual solution by caching stuff.

832
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:59,810
Rym: But then we run afoul of our multi-hundred year legacy of bullshit copyright laws where it is actually technically illegal for us to cache the things we have linked to.

833
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:10,370
Scott: Yeah, let's say I link to a news article and I keep that link to the news article, but then I also keep a screenshot of that news article or a copy of that webpage on my server.

834
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:12,948
Rym: And I just hold that copy--.

835
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,909
Rym: Say I link to a news article and then it changes.

836
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,130
Rym: Well, I can have my cache say, "Hey, that changed.

837
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:23,328
Rym: I'm linking to the original I saved because that person's covering something up or

838
00:45:23,368 --> 00:45:23,649
Rym: whatever.".

839
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:24,062
Scott: Yep.

840
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:42,370
Scott: But I could save the original and then in case the link changes, goes away, 404s, whatever, serve it up from myself, the one that I saw on that day, which is sort of why I use Imgur whenever I link to an image instead of hot-linking or hosting it myself.

841
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:50,890
Scott: It's like I take the image, I copy it to Imgur, then-- or I guess it's technically pronounced Imgur, but it's I-M-G-U-R dot com.

842
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,730
Scott: And then I link to that in my forum post or blog post.

843
00:45:54,790 --> 00:46:03,749
Scott: That way I know that, A, I don't have to pay to host this fucking image, and, two, that link is going to work and no one's going to care about hot-linking or anything like that.

844
00:46:04,613 --> 00:46:06,330
Scott: I don't even know how they afford to keep Imgur up.

845
00:46:07,273 --> 00:46:09,009
Rym: I don't know what their business model is at all.

846
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,009
Scott: I don't know either, but thank you for them.

847
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:21,769
Rym: Though, sadly, I looked at mine the other day because I was uploading a picture, and 75% of my pictures are My Little Pony related.

848
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:28,870
Rym: And actually 10% are some iteration of It's Goofy Time.

849
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:33,930
Scott: Yeah, okay, Imgur says, "As long as images are getting at least one view every six months, they will stick around forever.

850
00:46:34,511 --> 00:46:36,347
Scott: After that, your image may be removed to create more

851
00:46:36,387 --> 00:46:36,670
Scott: space.".

852
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:38,169
Scott: So they aren't-- it's not infinity.

853
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:39,209
Rym: Uh-oh, link rot.

854
00:46:40,177 --> 00:46:40,629
Scott: It is true.

855
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:51,749
Rym: That is also a very annoying thing because if we back up from the reality of it, the original vision of the internet is that we're sharing information, that there's posts and gets.

856
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,410
Rym: We're putting information and getting information.

857
00:46:55,070 --> 00:47:03,849
Rym: So the culture of our internet now is that when I'm posting and I see an image or something, I want to mash stuff up into my posts wherever I am.

858
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:10,430
Rym: Like, everyone who's using the internet is constantly creating content from everyone else's content, and we should all just be interlinking.

859
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:29,170
Rym: But the nature of the way links work and the way copyright law works means that link rot happens, and that, like, if you look at a forum thread, in our forum, let's say, or Neogaf or something awful or whatever, ten years from now, it won't make any sense because half of the responses are probably images that are gone.

860
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,789
Scott: Yeah, I mean, a lot of the, you know, it's sort of like--.

861
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:33,850
Rym: Look at Reddit culture.

862
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,989
Rym: People have whole conversations that are nothing but pictures.

863
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:38,830
Scott: Well, it's 4chan, right?

864
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:45,090
Scott: And speaking of 4chan, right, 4chan works in that it's designed around that idea that things are gonna fall off, right?

865
00:47:45,834 --> 00:47:48,390
Scott: It's not like our forum where you can go and read the very first post.

866
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:48,950
Rym: Ah, but there's two things.

867
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:54,510
Rym: There's also the 4chan archive where things that are gonna fall off that are deemed important are archived for posterity.

868
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,709
Scott: That's true, but most things just fall off, and they just delete things.

869
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,130
Scott: And in that way, the internet is like a living organism, right?

870
00:48:02,491 --> 00:48:12,650
Scott: It splits off and grows new cells from the old, and it evolves, but likewise, many dead cells are just chafed off and thrown in the trash, which, you know, it's kind of cool.

871
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,205
Scott: It's like, "Oh, the internet is a living

872
00:48:14,286 --> 00:48:14,589
Scott: thing.".

873
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:22,270
Rym: I'm fine with that, but I think there should be laws such that there are great exemptions to copyright law.

874
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:30,627
Scott: But on the other hand, it's like saying, "Oh, well, you know, the world's body of literature is a living thing, so let me just throw these old books out, 'cause we got new

875
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:30,909
Scott: books.".

876
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:31,496
Scott: It's like, "Oh, fuck

877
00:48:31,557 --> 00:48:31,719
Scott: no!".

878
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:39,229
Rym: So I want there to be exemptions to the law where you can basically violate intellectual property for certain archival purposes.

879
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:51,124
Scott: Yeah, if you are archiving something in a certain way, and you're not making money by reselling an archive, you're just holding on to something in case it goes away, then you should be able to do whatever you want.

880
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:58,690
Rym: Maybe even something as simple as, obviously there are exceptions to this, like if what was posted was itself illegal in some other intrinsic way.

881
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,970
Scott: Obviously, you're gonna have all these loopholes.

882
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:05,269
Rym: A general rule that once you publish something, fuck you, if you take it down, someone else is allowed to republish it.

883
00:49:05,431 --> 00:49:05,809
Scott: That's right.

884
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:12,850
Rym: But maybe no one else is allowed to republish it publicly so long as you are still providing it in the original form.

885
00:49:13,293 --> 00:49:15,610
Rym: But the moment you don't provide it anymore, fair game.

886
00:49:16,012 --> 00:49:16,510
Scott: Exactly, right?

887
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:20,670
Scott: So if I got original Star Wars, and you're not selling that shit, I can put it out there.

888
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:22,990
Rym: But as soon as you're selling it, I can't put it up there anymore.

889
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:26,529
Rym: That'd be really hard to litigate and manage, but I don't care.

890
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:31,350
Scott: The onus should always be on the copyright holder, right?

891
00:49:31,591 --> 00:49:36,089
Scott: It's like, let them have certain copyrights, but the onus should be on them.

892
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,370
Scott: It shouldn't be guilty until proven innocent.

893
00:49:38,852 --> 00:49:42,709
Scott: It should be no infringement until proven that there was, and such and such.

894
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:45,810
Scott: It should be always really hard for them to win the case.

895
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:54,749
Scott: That way, the society, we always lean towards more artistic expression, getting out to more people for less money.

896
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,410
Rym: But I feel like in the end, right now, the laws aren't going to change.

897
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,289
Rym: We can't rely on them.

898
00:49:59,432 --> 00:49:59,690
Rym: No kidding.

899
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,150
Rym: The technology at its core is not going to change.

900
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:02,610
Rym: No kidding.

901
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,370
Rym: And in fact, there are forces working actively against such things.

902
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:06,722
Rym: Yep.

903
00:50:06,951 --> 00:50:26,649
Rym: I mean, pretty much I'd say the majority of the content-producing companies of the world are against the kind of, I don't want to say Web 3.0, but the idea of the completely two-way web, opera style, where everyone who's browsing the web is also serving content to the web, and everyone is serving and providing and receiving all at the same time.

904
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:30,410
Rym: Because that basically gets rid of the whole idea of a distribution channel.

905
00:50:30,871 --> 00:50:35,229
Scott: The other problem we have is, for example, let's say this YouTube video is pretty popular, right?

906
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,288
Scott: And then it gets taken down.

907
00:50:36,632 --> 00:50:38,690
Scott: And then it goes up in a bunch of other places.

908
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,589
Scott: You've got to find the other places.

909
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:41,990
Scott: You know, it's not always easy.

910
00:50:42,371 --> 00:50:44,730
Scott: It's not like they're going to put up a redirect, right?

911
00:50:44,893 --> 00:50:45,045
Rym: Yep.

912
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:49,990
Scott: You've got to actually go out and find this other stuff, and then you've got to know that it was the same.

913
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:55,989
Scott: So even if I have an archive and someone goes looking for the thing, how are they going to even find it if Google isn't masterful?

914
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:09,727
Rym: So I guess the only thing we can do for now is, people like us and people like you who make content, be good citizens and do your redirects and everything right, even though everyone else might not use your redirect information effectively until it's too late.

915
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:13,089
Rym: Link as responsibly as you can.

916
00:51:13,972 --> 00:51:19,570
Rym: Don't complain when someone like us links to Slashdot, because Slashdot is going to outlive just about anything Slashdot links to.

917
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:26,190
Scott: Yeah, some people are really hung up on, like, I've seen people, like, I saw a pony Reddit once.

918
00:51:26,752 --> 00:51:30,230
Scott: They were like, "No, don't link to Imgur, link to the original artist.

919
00:51:30,331 --> 00:51:32,065
Scott: That way they get the visits on their

920
00:51:32,085 --> 00:51:32,650
Scott: DeviantArt.".

921
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:37,567
Scott: And I was like, "Dude, that shit might not be there tomorrow, but this Imgur sure as hell is going to

922
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:37,728
Scott: be.".

923
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:41,210
Scott: So their name is on the art, it's not like they're not getting credit or whatever.

924
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,309
Scott: I just want this link to fucking work.

925
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:48,010
Scott: So that's a lot more important than sending them to whatever page.

926
00:51:49,372 --> 00:52:00,970
Rym: And I guess we have to have the greater discussion of, the generations that are making surprising amounts of content on the internet, it won't be long until people in that generation start dying of old age.

927
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:08,670
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, you can still see, for example, all your base, because it was big and people are trying to keep it around.

928
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:16,810
Rym: And I intend for the entire, you know, 70 year span of GeekNights, to be online effectively forever, long after I have been.

929
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:19,130
Scott: But do you see how hard it was for us to find that team?

930
00:52:20,033 --> 00:52:20,609
Rym: Ninja Turtles.

931
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:21,181
Rym: I know.

932
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,269
Rym: I kind of wish we hadn't found it.

933
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:32,550
Scott: Right, but the point is, imagine, you know, if we hadn't found it, that's like something horrible that was lost, but it was still a piece of art that was lost, no matter how bad it was.

934
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:33,655
Rym: Yes, it was art.

935
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,670
Rym: It was art in the ACLU definition of art.

936
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:39,910
Scott: You know, so it deserves- It elicited a response.

937
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,719
Scott: It deserves to exist, I guess.

938
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,890
Scott: It doesn't deserve much else, but to exist.

939
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,849
Scott: I wouldn't say deserves to exist, but it has a right to exist if it wants to.

940
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:57,090
Rym: What amazed me, though, was that not only did we find it, but there were a surprising number of very similar works that were not it.

941
00:52:57,772 --> 00:52:58,846
Scott: That's true, but- That we found.

942
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:03,790
Scott: Right, but it's like, how could you even, you know, it was like basically a miracle that we found out about it.

943
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:07,010
Scott: How many things were there that we never saw back in the day?

944
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:12,430
Scott: You know, there was probably a funny video back in like the year 2000 that we didn't see, and now we never will see.

945
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:13,869
Rym: Does anyone remember HatBaby?

946
00:53:15,016 --> 00:53:15,649
Scott: I think, yeah.

947
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:18,849
Rym: I hope they do, because a lot of people don't know what HatBaby actually was.

948
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:19,543
Rym: What?

949
00:53:20,591 --> 00:53:22,588
Rym: We talked about it on GeekKnives years ago.

950
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,190
Scott: HatBaby, okay.

951
00:53:23,555 --> 00:53:23,830
Rym: Yeah.

952
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:24,790
Scott: Anyway.

953
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:27,090
Scott: Are we done?

954
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:27,727
Rym: Yeah, we're done.

955
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:36,010
Rym: This has been GeekKnives with Rym and Scott.

956
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:41,150
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

957
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:46,550
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

958
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,490
Rym: Remember, GeekKnives is not one, but four different shows.

959
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:54,230
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

961
00:53:58,993 --> 00:54:02,050
Scott: GeekKnives is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

962
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,230
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
