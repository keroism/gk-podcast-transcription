00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,477
Rym: Hey, it's Thursday September October 20th.

2
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:13,402
Scott: Fuck you I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:16,411
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,873 --> 00:00:18,317
Rym: We're doing a short show about.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,698
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:35,137
Rym: we haven't done this in a while, but there was a time long ago, you know GeekNights has been running since 2005 and We used to go four nights a week.

7
00:00:35,177 --> 00:00:37,290
Rym: In fact for many years we did four shows a week.

8
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,882
Rym: Sometimes we would not have an idea for a show.

9
00:00:41,344 --> 00:00:43,069
Rym: luckily that never happens very often.

10
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:56,450
Rym: But anyway, we uh, what we would do is we would do a special like alright instead of a full-on episode of GeekNights We're gonna do like a five-minute episode or a ten-minute episode and skip all the formality.

11
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:58,377
Scott: Yes, it's better than no episode right?

12
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:04,019
Rym: But what we'd always do is preface it by saying something like hey This isn't a real episode of geek now.

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,864
Scott: It doesn't fucking matter.

14
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:06,692
Rym: We used to care We used to be like.

15
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:09,542
Scott: so if you hear this people are new to podcast with new.

16
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:10,967
Scott: podcasting was relatively new.

17
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:11,890
Scott: people still didn't know.

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,655
Rym: Yeah, I mean now it's dead doesn't matter.

19
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:14,458
Rym: It doesn't matter.

20
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,470
Rym: Yeah, but I do have a little bit of news.

21
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,348
Rym: I don't want a news.

22
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,534
Rym: I want to talk about news.

23
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:21,057
Scott: they can strip.

24
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:28,465
Rym: we can stretch out for some time because there have been a couple of Articles like this recently and this one is not the most egregious.

25
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:29,449
Rym: It's just the most recent.

26
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:37,090
Rym: But the TSA as you know is is basically an organization designed to make air travel Uncomfortable and annoying.

27
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,287
Rym: They have been expanding their purview into Amtrak.

28
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:45,530
Rym: They've been randomly like setting up at Amtrak stations and they're allowed to do that.

29
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:48,287
Rym: There's been fights about that, but they always seem to win.

30
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:53,135
Rym: In fact, I don't know if it was them, but it looked like them There was some security.

31
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:58,416
Rym: when when I took Amtrak up to go Apple buck in the other weekend Did they say that say TSA?

32
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:02,330
Rym: on their uniform two of the people had TSA badges and the rest of them were like normal employees?

33
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:05,650
Rym: But they were standing at like one stairwell going down to the train.

34
00:02:06,197 --> 00:02:12,869
Rym: We just walked you know It was Penn Station to one of the other like ten stairwells that goes down to the trains and skipped it.

35
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:21,959
Rym: I wasn't gonna go through that and I remember when we went to Philly some of the trains they were doing like TSA crap More than once in Queensborough Plaza station.

36
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,810
Rym: I've run into TSA agents with the police Randomly searching people trying to enter the subway.

37
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:34,870
Scott: I've seen you know the cops standing there with a plastic folding table near subway engines But never once have I actually seen them ever search anybody.

38
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,750
Scott: It's like they're just standing there because I've never seen a TSA agent with them.

39
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,221
Rym: I've seen them search at least 40 people this year.

40
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:42,843
Rym: Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:46,428
Rym: I've never been asked to be searched recently ever.

42
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:52,849
Rym: But if I am well the thing is if I was I'd probably just walk to the next subway station and get on but I digress.

43
00:02:53,083 --> 00:03:03,990
Rym: Yep I still kind of like my plan of carrying a ratty briefcase and anytime if I do get stopped and they want to search it I'll be like no never mind and then throw the briefcase away in the garbage and just walk away.

44
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:05,674
Scott: It's a good plan.

45
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,962
Rym: Yeah, there's no crime committed there.

46
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:08,785
Rym: I have no intent.

47
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:13,341
Rym: It's a ready old briefcase I was taken to throw away full of I don't know rocks.

48
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:16,150
Rym: Yeah and alarm clocks and bowling ball.

49
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:29,650
Rym: But anyway, they Tennessee has decided to allow them to start searching Bus stations and waystations on the interstate.

50
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,607
Rym: They are randomly checking trucks with drug and bomb sniffing dogs and all this BS.

51
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:36,610
Scott: go to Tennessee.

52
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:39,720
Rym: Uh, yeah, that's already good advice.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,957
Rym: Yeah, even though the Smoky Mountains are beautiful actually, Tennessee I was sure you

54
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:46,290
Scott: can see the Smoky Mountains from out for if you're not in

55
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:54,270
Rym: I would regret not being able to go to Tennessee though Gatlinburg I hear has become even Increasingly touristy and I don't know if I ever need to go back.

56
00:03:54,952 --> 00:04:00,169
Scott: No desire to ever go to Tennessee really this I mean, you know, this Memphis is there I guess but you know what.

57
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,113
Rym: Here's this good walking.

58
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:03,358
Scott: Yeah, but you know what?

59
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,185
Scott: There's 10 billion other places on earth.

60
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,489
Scott: I can go to see better better.

61
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,989
Rym: So Tennessee was not that bad when I was there.

62
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:13,790
Scott: I'm saying it's like if you made a list of places to go.

63
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:15,242
Scott: It's not like there's no reason to ever go.

64
00:04:15,262 --> 00:04:21,029
Rym: Tennessee is a great But if you made a list or horse back near the bottom you want to go like horseback riding through mountain trails.

65
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:22,919
Scott: Are there better places?

66
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,326
Scott: yes lots of them.

67
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:25,050
Rym: name one.

68
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:26,839
Rym: I mean, where are the Smoky Mountains?

69
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,810
Rym: Scott your choice of states is pretty limited.

70
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,141
Rym: I think Tennessee is not writing for riding horses in mountains.

71
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:34,589
Scott: I but I'd rather do desert horse riding.

72
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:34,870
Scott: Really?

73
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,780
Rym: Yeah, so you want to go to Arizona or Nevada which one's worse?

74
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:39,406
Rym: Egypt Egypt.

75
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:40,028
Rym: Yep.

76
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:42,216
Rym: Okay No turmoil there.

77
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:43,000
Rym: Everything's just fine.

78
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,650
Scott: I didn't say there wasn't a vibe for desert horse riding.

79
00:04:46,173 --> 00:05:00,288
Rym: ah, but the the political problems of Egypt are Analogous to the political problems of Tennessee and that your reason to avoid Tennessee seems to be due to the TSA is bullshit Not the quality of the activities they're in.

80
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,027
Rym: Regardless anyway, I I Wonder at what point?

81
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:13,136
Rym: People won't put up with the shit anymore and I worry that there is no point at which someone will say, you know What I'm not flying.

82
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:15,927
Scott: Yeah, the problem is is that there are people there.

83
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:22,090
Rym: So Scott Or any before you say problem is I'm gonna ask you a very simple question.

84
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:31,362
Rym: Yeah if when we were about to fly to pecs prime next year over Labor Day and They stop you and say they want to do their extended TSA bullshit.

85
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:38,150
Rym: I'll say I'll take the groping Alright, so you're gonna let him grope you to go to pecs rather than not flying.

86
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,720
Rym: Regroping it's not a negative Alright, so you're cool with the TSA.

87
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:52,930
Rym: No, I'm cool with getting groped But you're annoyed at the TSA, right you're annoyed at having to stand in these crazy security lines and take off your shoes.

88
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,660
Scott: Yes, the waiting in line sucks Scott.

89
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,530
Rym: Do you take off your shoes to get on a plane?

90
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,051
Rym: Do you let?

91
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:58,658
Rym: do you comply with that order?

92
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,200
Scott: Yeah.

93
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:01,710
Rym: Yeah, so that means you're okay with it, right?

94
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:03,495
Scott: I would rather not.

95
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,270
Rym: so what are you doing to not have to do it?

96
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:06,833
Rym: Don't we?

97
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:09,150
Rym: I mean I would wager that's less.

98
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:13,766
Scott: I probably would have flown to like anime Boston and all sorts in mag fest, but we took.

99
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:20,348
Rym: oh, yes instead I fly less, but I don't fly zero because it's it's so incredibly inconvenient.

100
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:26,047
Rym: Yes So we're still putting convenience above our civil liberties, but there is a point at which.

101
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:26,870
Scott: what is that boy?

102
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,757
Scott: I have to Seattle there.

103
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:31,088
Rym: Is there really what would they have to do for you to say?

104
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:31,530
Rym: You know what?

105
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,715
Rym: I'm driving to Seattle.

106
00:06:32,756 --> 00:06:34,725
Rym: I'm taking a week and a half off work for packs.

107
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:46,570
Scott: if there was no Grop option if it was just go through the machine I would take I would not fly Do or what I would do is I would go through the expense of getting like the private jet or chartered flight.

108
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:47,354
Scott: So you don't have to do that.

109
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:50,129
Rym: Ah, you know what that actually brings up an important point.

110
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:57,654
Rym: The rich probably have more control over the political process than the poor and the richer you are the more you can avoid that sort Of BS.

111
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,650
Scott: Yeah, we just take the chartered flight no matter what it costs.

112
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:10,319
Rym: Yeah But it's kind of disingenuous for us to $1,000 each way chartered flight say that the problem is that people put up with it when we actually have the monetary means to not Have to put up with it if it gets bad.

113
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:13,211
Rym: Well, most people don't then I Don't know.

114
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,863
Rym: I I feel like I'm getting.

115
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:23,297
Scott: I'm not saying TSA is great I'm saying that there's a problem is when you go to airports, you know, I listen to people talk I talk to people.

116
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:32,149
Scott: it seems like there is a percentage of people who knows what percentage it is without a study or a few studies that actually believes that the security is.

117
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:39,150
Scott: You know help and actually increase the security Makes them feel safe and they like it and don't want it to go away.

118
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:45,656
Scott: I don't think there is a large proportion because and I don't know what the proportion is But there are definitely such people Scott.

119
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:46,237
Rym: there are people.

120
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:53,041
Scott: there was a basically cowards who are better be safe than sorry the same Cowards who want the playgrounds to not have met.

121
00:07:53,061 --> 00:08:07,260
Rym: There was a story on today About a man who caused a gigantic fire in his apartment building because he took his poop and put it in his Ron his radiator Thinking that alchemy would turn that poop into gold.

122
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:07,802
Scott: Yep.

123
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:09,988
Rym: There are people who believe anything.

124
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:22,790
Rym: Yes So you can't say I don't think there are enough people who actually fly who are okay with the TSA To where if we had a public referendum vote the TSA would not immediately be disbanded.

125
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:30,430
Scott: But there's also people who don't fly also vote and could be affected by planes landing on them.

126
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:40,370
Scott: But at the same time I would argue that lock They don't care about inconveniencing you non you fliers if it makes them right like imagine if there was some way.

127
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,364
Scott: You know, like, you know almost all security causes inconvenience.

128
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:45,890
Scott: There's no way to get security for free.

129
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,158
Scott: It always costs something right cause money.

130
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:51,370
Scott: or even locking your door to your house costs inconvenience.

131
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,483
Scott: You're gonna lock yourself out at least once in your life.

132
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:54,509
Scott: You got to remember the key.

133
00:08:54,831 --> 00:09:00,290
Scott: You got to spend that one second of time to lock it right, you know Security costs inconvenience.

134
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:06,990
Scott: But imagine if you could somehow get security for yourself, but a hundred percent of the inconvenience is for somebody else.

135
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,682
Scott: Well, it's got knocks on you at all.

136
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:09,710
Rym: What if we pass the law?

137
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,056
Scott: Why would you ever say no to that?

138
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:13,490
Rym: cars can't drive more than two miles an hour in New York?

139
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,835
Rym: That'd be great for us bikers.

140
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:16,883
Scott: It would be awesome wouldn't hurt me at all.

141
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:18,550
Scott: I'd be totally in favor of that shit.

142
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:20,297
Rym: Yeah, thus the problem.

143
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:21,220
Scott: Yep.

144
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:38,389
Rym: I don't know what to do about it, but I'm getting to the point to where because I have the wealth to avoid the problems I will no longer put up with the TSA if I have to deal with their bullshit Except flying because I don't know if I want to spend the money to charter a flight to Seattle every

145
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:38,510
Scott: year.

146
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,153
Scott: But what if we could?

147
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:42,230
Scott: the thing is what if we can get a whole plane to be PAX people?

148
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,169
Rym: It would still be kind of expensive.

149
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:49,090
Scott: I think it could actually be a good deal if we can like charter a PAX flight from New York to Seattle.

150
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:50,310
Scott: There's enough people.

151
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:53,285
Rym: It's not that there's enough PAX attendees.

152
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:56,866
Rym: there's enough Industry people here who are going every year, right?

153
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,250
Scott: But I'm saying is we can definitely get a plane full of people to get something that has jet engines and not propellers.

154
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:05,635
Rym: Anyway, that's all I got.

155
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:08,245
Rym: I'm so I'm angry about the TSA as always.

156
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:09,249
Scott: that's not news.

157
00:10:10,252 --> 00:10:26,750
Rym: the only other thing I can say in history, isn't it funny how The Republican Party in America which claims partly that it doesn't want federal government overreaching Doesn't seem to be too broken up about the TSA because that's defense and or security and or police.

158
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,810
Rym: But at the same time they want to spend a billion dollars in defense.

159
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:36,448
Rym: But at the same time they they are actually really weak on defense lately and they were really mad about all the money We spent on Libya.

160
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:39,449
Scott: Yeah, cuz they're mad about spending money.

161
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:40,634
Rym: But yeah, they were.

162
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:45,732
Rym: they would have been fine with that money had it been a Republican president because it doesn't matter what the actual Policy is.

163
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:51,210
Scott: Oh, it's just about creating a story in the media that day whatever story they want to make.

164
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,015
Rym: This is not news either.

165
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:57,128
Rym: Nope We don't do news.

166
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:00,050
Scott: But the thing is I love up, you know.

167
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,954
Scott: It's like you see people.

168
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:03,946
Scott: you complain about the same things over and over again acting like someone.

169
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:04,870
Scott: it's a new discovery.

170
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:11,464
Rym: Acting like somebody who hasn't discovered it already is Being lightened when the rest of us in the crew talk about politics.

171
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:12,910
Rym: We actually have a discussion.

172
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:20,184
Scott: It's just impossible with you because you immediately because you're not discussing anything What have you discussed that is new in any way shape or form that we do not.

173
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:25,526
Scott: people do not already know That and you know, no one's ever gonna change your mind or be enlightened or discovery.

174
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:28,334
Scott: There's nothing to discover It's it's already known.

175
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:29,276
Scott: there is no secrets.

176
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:32,386
Scott: There is no valuable political discussion to be had.

177
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:33,910
Scott: if there is a valuable.

178
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:40,970
Scott: I don't even believe that political science professors can have a valuable political discussion because it's pretty much a solved thing.

179
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,515
Scott: Everyone knows everything and Scott.

180
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:44,421
Scott: This is why nothing more to know.

181
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,310
Rym: I talked to the other Scott about politics, right?

182
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,303
Scott: But anyway speaking of your politics, right?

183
00:11:51,323 --> 00:11:53,270
Scott: There is a near miracle has happened.

184
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:58,981
Scott: this is actually something new right not something old a Couple senators one of which is ours.

185
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:03,810
Rym: He's actually crappy, but whatever Name a non crappy one who's still in power.

186
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:08,861
Scott: I don't think Bernie Sanders is a senator isn't is?

187
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:13,563
Scott: he's a house guy named two senators two senators period.

188
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:18,485
Rym: yeah That are currently senators sure, you know, whatever Oh ever.

189
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:27,210
Scott: Oh, well in Connecticut the senators when I was young were Chris Dodd who I don't think is a senator anymore.

190
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,978
Rym: Okay, nevermind I made my point go on anyway.

191
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:34,930
Scott: so our senator Schumer who sucks right and some of that bad.

192
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:35,553
Scott: It's pretty bad.

193
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:42,602
Scott: and the guy as some guy named Mike Lee from Utah Right came up with an original idea or at least an idea.

194
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:45,572
Scott: I had not heard before which is Amazing.

195
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:53,049
Scott: The idea is this if you want to move to the US and you buy a house Will give you a visa.

196
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:57,370
Scott: So it's like hey, this kind of solves the immigration thing.

197
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,774
Scott: It's like people can move here and totally cool if they have money if they buy a house You know.

198
00:13:03,436 --> 00:13:05,142
Scott: and it's like well, that's actually.

199
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:07,570
Scott: and it also solves the problem of not enough demand for houses.

200
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:10,050
Scott: So the idea I was thinking hey, it's a great idea.

201
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:16,090
Scott: These Mexicans can come and just buy cheapo houses in Arizona or wherever people might think that's not terribly feasible.

202
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:20,130
Rym: But there are a surprising number of abandoned brand-new houses in Arizona.

203
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,769
Scott: You can move to Detroit buy a house for five bucks get a visa.

204
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:29,030
Rym: So get houses for free in Detroit if you're willing to assume the negligible property taxes, so this is a great idea.

205
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:30,741
Scott: Here's the problem with their idea.

206
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:32,230
Scott: at least there's nothing wrong.

207
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,825
Rym: It's got problem one the.

208
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:39,470
Rym: you know To use it all the devil's in the details that the actual implementation of such a thing would be far from trivial.

209
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,137
Scott: Well, no, here's the problem.

210
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:46,450
Scott: They're not actually just proposing, you know won't be a good idea Which is buy a house get a visa.

211
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:52,848
Scott: They're proposing spend half a million dollars on real estate in the u.s.

212
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:53,710
Scott: Get a visa.

213
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,941
Scott: Basically, it's like hey rich people can move here.

214
00:13:57,543 --> 00:13:58,146
Scott: It's like what.

215
00:13:58,206 --> 00:13:58,869
Scott: are you kidding me?

216
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,075
Scott: What?

217
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:01,049
Scott: why did you even have it?

218
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,977
Scott: What's the point of having a money limit at all?

219
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:03,941
Scott: make it fucking zero.

220
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:07,581
Scott: if anyone buys any real estate in the u.s They and they're not from the u.s.

221
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:08,609
Scott: They she gives it a. get a visa.

222
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:11,042
Rym: You know what I would do immediately.

223
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:12,510
Rym: I owned some property.

224
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:19,802
Rym: I could get some more and I would parcel it out into square centimeters Okay, and then sell it for 500 bucks.

225
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,970
Rym: cool to give everyone visas sweet.

226
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:28,510
Rym: So you do you think Scott honestly that if we effectively had an open border?

227
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,497
Rym: Anyone in the world can just move here wherever they want.

228
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:32,138
Rym: That's fine.

229
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:36,190
Rym: that that would not cause any political turmoil economic upheaval problems.

230
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:37,849
Scott: I don't see the problem.

231
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:38,975
Rym: So you think that would?

232
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,667
Scott: I think I think anyone should be able to live wherever the fuck they want.

233
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:44,224
Scott: if I want to Move to Finland they shouldn't be able to say no.

234
00:14:44,244 --> 00:14:50,669
Rym: I should be like I'm moving here I'm so Scott Do you think that universal health care in nations like Finland could still be feasible in a world like that?

235
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:55,165
Scott: If it's not feasible in a world like that, it's not feasible Scott.

236
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:59,350
Rym: by that logic I would argue that the majority of human accomplishments are not feasible.

237
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:02,178
Rym: No kidding, but yet we have.

238
00:15:02,258 --> 00:15:02,720
Scott: it's not it's.

239
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,522
Scott: but that's the thing.

240
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:13,947
Scott: is it just shows you that all these things that people know No, I think it's your only have a surprisingly black and white and naive Worldview because people want all these things like oh we want universal health care.

241
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:14,530
Scott: Well, that's great.

242
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:16,169
Scott: Can you provide it for the entire world?

243
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,509
Scott: It is not Paul.

244
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,075
Scott: So we're gonna provide.

245
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:20,761
Scott: you know been broken down to.

246
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:25,521
Rym: if you didn't bring enough cupcakes for everybody Then you can't bring cupcakes for anybody right?

247
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:26,747
Scott: because it's so hypocritical.

248
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:27,350
Scott: you complain.

249
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:32,330
Scott: You know these people out there are complaining about the rich 1% and they're like we should have health care for everyone.

250
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:33,460
Scott: So it's like okay.

251
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:34,530
Scott: Well now you've got the problem.

252
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,710
Scott: So everyone in the US should have health care and anyone in rich European countries should have it.

253
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,479
Scott: But fuck all those other people in the world.

254
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,838
Scott: It's like well now you're the same as those 1% You were just decrying.

255
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:45,269
Scott: you've just made it a slight.

256
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:50,410
Scott: now It's the biggest 5% of the world is jerks you want instead of 1% of the Americans are jerks.

257
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:58,205
Rym: You're once again as with pretty much every non computer anime or they don't believe in countries I don't ever see.

258
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:05,388
Rym: people Have an amazing ability to not understand the concepts of scale for one.

259
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:08,763
Scott: Anyway, no, but I mean what.

260
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:09,890
Scott: why is it right to do?

261
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,410
Scott: You know, I don't believe in countries.

262
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,200
Scott: So why is it right to do it for the?

263
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,950
Scott: you know these people but not for all the people.

264
00:16:15,211 --> 00:16:15,734
Rym: Maybe Scott?

265
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:17,160
Rym: because there's no such thing as right or wrong.

266
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:21,119
Rym: There's your own constructs exactly Yeah, so why should I listen to yours?

267
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:22,043
Rym: because no one agrees with you?

268
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:24,441
Scott: No, but I'm just saying I just point out there It's hypocrisy.

269
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:27,114
Scott: everywhere Everyone is hypocritical.

270
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:31,768
Rym: Yeah, because there's no such thing as taking into consideration, you know scale or real world.

271
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,945
Scott: Okay, so we can afford to give it to this many people.

272
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:35,770
Scott: How do you decide who?

273
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:37,135
Scott: Oh the Americans only.

274
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:38,018
Scott: well, that's okay.

275
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,721
Rym: Great Scott.

276
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:40,528
Rym: It's more that art inside of America.

277
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:42,743
Rym: For example We've got an economy that we built.

278
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:43,570
Rym: we have our own laws.

279
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:49,850
Rym: I mean our laws don't apply to people outside of our country and some countries out there have laws that we would consider bad.

280
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:52,920
Rym: Yeah, so why do we let them have those bad laws?

281
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,330
Scott: I don't think that there should be countries.

282
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,744
Scott: I don't think so should apply to all people everywhere.

283
00:16:58,784 --> 00:16:59,367
Rym: All right, Scott.

284
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:00,170
Rym: So what is the idea?

285
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,329
Rym: What if half the people in the world think murder should be illegal and half the people think it should not be illegal who?

286
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,270
Scott: Gets to say I'm not saying I believed in democracy.

287
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,030
Rym: So, how do you determine what law gets applied to all people?

288
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,935
Scott: The right law?

289
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:15,669
Rym: what's the right law?

290
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,381
Rym: Whatever I say, okay This is why again I talked to the other Scott.

291
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:24,276
Rym: when it comes to politics What is the point?

292
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:27,327
Scott: is your position is laughable and all this this idea is dumb.

293
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:29,334
Scott: half a million dollars I mean at least.

294
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:33,110
Scott: even even if you're gonna make it some number at least make it a reasonable number.

295
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:42,858
Rym: Is not that far from what I was gonna pay for a house in Beacon, yeah you an incredibly wealthy person Well, you think there's some immigrant from Mexico.

296
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:43,460
Scott: how what kind of house?

297
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,717
Rym: I'm just saying while I'm incredibly wealthy Relative to the majority of humans.

298
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:55,270
Scott: I'm not incredibly wealthy compared to even the top 10% Right, and the thing is they're like, oh if you don't have half a million, that's fine.

299
00:17:55,631 --> 00:18:02,587
Scott: Buy two hundred fifty thousand dollar house and then buy another two hundred fifty thousand dollar house to rent out and that'll that'll give you Over-the-limit and you'll be okay.

300
00:18:04,114 --> 00:18:05,558
Rym: This law is prob.

301
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:07,524
Rym: I haven't actually read this law because I don't think it'll pass.

302
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:08,547
Scott: Well, yeah, it's just.

303
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:09,450
Scott: it's an idea.

304
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:17,810
Scott: It's not only gives even a bill yet Yeah, but my guess is preparing to introduce the idea as a part of a larger package of immigration measures.

305
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:30,290
Rym: I'm pretty sure it was thrown in as pork probably to kick the money back to some real estate Companies or the real having trouble selling the expensive houses as they have no no problem selling the cheap houses.

306
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:40,476
Rym: Yep, and I don't know what to do about it I don't trust pretty much any legislation that comes because it's gonna have so much crap added onto it by the end that it Doesn't even it's even recognizable.

307
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:43,650
Rym: No one in the Senate or the house even reads the legislation.

308
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:44,615
Scott: I got a new law.

309
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:46,544
Scott: no new laws for ten years.

310
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:47,690
Scott: That's my new law.

311
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:49,940
Scott: No country can make any new law for ten years.

312
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,654
Rym: All right, so that also means we can't Lighten up laws.

313
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,363
Rym: We can't make them less bad.

314
00:18:55,383 --> 00:19:00,544
Scott: Oh Any law that was made less than ten years ago is void.

315
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,949
Scott: only older laws are okay.

316
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:04,255
Rym: Alright hope so.

317
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:04,758
Rym: ten years.

318
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:05,340
Rym: That's your line.

319
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,229
Scott: Yeah, we're right before the GMCA.

320
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:20,887
Scott: That's the line that gets rid of the Patriot Act - which came later Anyway, because this is turned into a long episode.

321
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:25,360
Rym: Anyway things of the day you got for me is a funny video.

322
00:19:25,862 --> 00:19:26,865
Scott: It's not college humor.

323
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:28,972
Scott: It's just a college humor spin-off site.

324
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:31,280
Scott: Oh shit loophole people.

325
00:19:32,283 --> 00:19:33,008
Rym: I don't understand.

326
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:34,800
Rym: I understand why they split off dorkly.

327
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:42,080
Rym: I do not understand why they split off jest unless they're trying to market the exact same humor to people who?

328
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,370
Rym: Look at the name college humor and think it's for punk kids.

329
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,980
Scott: I'm not sure why people do these spin-off sites.

330
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:49,224
Scott: Period it's like.

331
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:51,251
Rym: why would you the reason they did it?

332
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:53,580
Rym: My guess is that college humor?

333
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,673
Rym: We don't look at that name and read anything into it.

334
00:19:56,713 --> 00:20:00,930
Rym: We haven't been in college for a long time And it's not really aimed at college students.

335
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,700
Rym: to me this is what TV should be.

336
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:16,552
Rym: So they're probably rebranding it to people who aren't in college who maybe will start watching internet crap like this Yet wouldn't watch college humor, but would enjoy everything that's on college humor.

337
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:18,397
Scott: I don't know whatever the point is.

338
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,340
Scott: they made a funny video.

339
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:22,179
Scott: It's a an MBA lockout fundraiser.

340
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:25,900
Scott: People in New York will understand this one a lot better than other people.

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,175
Scott: Basically they get people pretending to be NBA players going in the subway.

342
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:32,580
Scott: hey selling M&Ms.

343
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:41,820
Scott: Just like you know kids often will do this for their high school basketball teams or at least say they're doing it for the high School basketball teams, but it's funny.

344
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:49,698
Rym: Anyway, I don't I like this video So right along those lines doing something not a college humor because I don't need to rely on.

345
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:53,920
Rym: Not dorkly sure not just right the bike thief.

346
00:20:54,020 --> 00:21:08,788
Rym: this is a video because my bike was stolen a while ago, and I miss old movie much better bike now, but New York City is with my last check the most bike steel in his place in America and You know my bike was stolen.

347
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:09,915
Rym: bikes are stolen all the time.

348
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:15,438
Rym: when I talked to the cops They said there's professional bike thievery rings because it's so lucrative and it's so trivial to steal them.

349
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,932
Scott: so this guy How lucrative it is.

350
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:19,575
Scott: someone has to be buying stolen bikes.

351
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:21,417
Scott: yeah, who's buying stolen bike?

352
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:23,040
Rym: Craigslist used bike shops.

353
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,054
Scott: Which bike shop is selling the stolen bikes?

354
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:27,040
Rym: who knows all of them?

355
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,947
Rym: Do you know how many crappy bike shops there are everywhere?

356
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:30,694
Scott: I only really see nice ones.

357
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:31,899
Scott: Where's the crappy ones?

358
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,730
Rym: I look at like the one right under my building.

359
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:37,040
Scott: It's not you think that one selling stolen bikes?

360
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,642
Scott: You never know.

361
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:38,605
Scott: I don't think so.

362
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:41,194
Rym: someone's buying him because there's a huge demand to steal him.

363
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:46,520
Scott: I Don't know who's bought sues selling them, so I can buy the stolen bikes for less money.

364
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:53,900
Rym: But anyway to prove how trivial it is to steal bikes these guys went around and basically just stole their own fucking bike.

365
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:54,847
Rym: Isn't this really old?

366
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:56,580
Rym: it is, but I don't think we've ever talked about it.

367
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,026
Scott: I think I feel like we have whatever.

368
00:21:58,087 --> 00:22:02,143
Rym: maybe it got to the point to where he started bringing an angle grinder and Plugging it in.

369
00:22:02,163 --> 00:22:07,080
Rym: no one even batted an eye even when he tried to act as suspicious as possible.

370
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:07,663
Scott: What are you gonna?

371
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:09,069
Scott: Do if you see a suspicious guy like that?

372
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:11,579
Rym: I would immediately go up and say hey is that your fucking bike?

373
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:16,032
Scott: Go see if there's a police standing around.

374
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:16,092
Scott: No.

375
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,540
Rym: I just feel like what you doing.

376
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:19,545
Rym: What you doing.

377
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,574
Rym: take pictures of him like what's up?

378
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:22,459
Rym: Hey there?

379
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,632
Rym: Bike thief bike thief yo everyone because it's not like you're alone.

380
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:28,940
Rym: It's not like this one dudes there, and he's gonna stab you.

381
00:22:29,242 --> 00:22:32,400
Rym: There's like a thousand people within sight of these bike thieves.

382
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:34,806
Rym: So if I'm in you know New York.

383
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:37,155
Rym: if you make a ruckus a crowd forms immediately.

384
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:39,344
Rym: if it's a real ruckus Maybe purse thief.

385
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:41,432
Rym: ten people already tackled the fucker.

386
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:41,593
Scott: Well.

387
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:42,235
Scott: It's a purse thief.

388
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:47,179
Scott: That's different than a bike thief Yeah, but no one's doing someone's hurting a person as opposed to hurting a thing.

389
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:56,636
Rym: But at the same time if no one cares if you spray-paint the wall But you try to spray-paint a person, but if I call out the bike thief And then I'd be like oh shit like he's gonna attack me.

390
00:22:56,817 --> 00:22:59,396
Rym: He's gonna get tackled by the same people.

391
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:03,578
Rym: Especially found a little old lady, but anyway funny story.

392
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:06,758
Rym: Emily Did that to a guy Not that long ago.

393
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:14,399
Rym: She was walking and a guy was just kind of walking up to a bike pulled out some bolt cutters and cut the chain And I was like hey is that your bike?

394
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,724
Rym: What you doing?

395
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:21,149
Rym: and the guy opens his jacket, and he has a Park Department Services shirt and badge.

396
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:23,780
Rym: he's like yeah, this bikes been here for like a month.

397
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:26,192
Rym: We're taking it to the impound whatever.

398
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:27,740
Scott: is he full of shit?

399
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:36,234
Rym: If he was full of shit He is a professional full-time bike thief And I guess he deserves it because he had the shirt and the badge.

400
00:23:36,737 --> 00:23:37,179
Scott: I guess so.

401
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:38,845
Rym: And it think about it.

402
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:44,107
Rym: if you have the shirt and badge you went out that day saying I'm gonna steal fucking bikes Mmm.

403
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,377
Rym: You're prepared yeah.

404
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:47,909
Rym: But also funny story.

405
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:54,157
Rym: remember when I stole my bike back from that guy I had sawed the chain off in front of multiple trains of people because it took a while to heck.

406
00:23:54,177 --> 00:23:54,940
Rym: saw that chain off.

407
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:59,020
Rym: Even the copper drove by looked right at me and didn't even slow down.

408
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,192
Rym: No, so yeah no meta moment because it's Thursday episode.

409
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:07,322
Rym: doing real quick Scott Emily, and I made Sushi.

410
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,069
Rym: yeah for the first time ever.

411
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:11,780
Scott: it's hard, but not as hard as I expected.

412
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:13,208
Scott: I mean we didn't have to cut the fish.

413
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:15,200
Scott: I'm sure cutting the fish is also a hard part.

414
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:15,822
Scott: We did not do.

415
00:24:15,842 --> 00:24:18,131
Rym: yeah my skilled hands do not exist right.

416
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:22,333
Scott: so the cutting of the fish is like supposed to be the hard Part and the skill requiring part.

417
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,940
Scott: you know where you have a fish And you have to cut the piece of the fish off in just the right shape.

418
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:31,640
Rym: We did not do that at all yeah, so if you guys want to make sushi really the trick is to get all the stuff.

419
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,624
Rym: That's not dangerous.

420
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:37,804
Rym: buy some crab stick some of that egg some of that like a B's a B Uh shrimp.

421
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:40,920
Rym: get some avocado some honey-roasted peanuts.

422
00:24:41,322 --> 00:24:41,925
Scott: Yeah, you can get.

423
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:47,650
Scott: you can get already ready to sushi eels yep You know from the Japanese market or whatever.

424
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,300
Scott: and then you only have to do the rolling part.

425
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,100
Scott: You don't have to do the cutting part you do have to do the making sushi rice, right?

426
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,425
Scott: So that's actually some.

427
00:24:55,465 --> 00:24:59,080
Scott: you know the significantly hard part that people don't realize the making of the sushi rice.

428
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,900
Scott: So you buy sushi rice you put it in the rice cooker?

429
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:06,460
Scott: But then you gotta like add vinegar and some other and sugar and stuff to it.

430
00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:07,849
Scott: And then you got to whip it up.

431
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:13,394
Scott: and and if you go on yeah If you go on YouTube right you'll actually see videos of like how to do this.

432
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:16,526
Scott: you need to get like a big wooden bowl And a paddle and a fan.

433
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:26,740
Scott: you'd like cool the rice down because it comes out of the rice cooker hot And you got a. you know you got to whip it up so that it sticks But then you'll know the rice is perfect when it sticks to itself.

434
00:25:27,282 --> 00:25:32,580
Scott: But eating it will cause it to just fall apart, and we did not do the rice a hundred percent exactly right.

435
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,544
Scott: It was pretty good though.

436
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,980
Scott: It was good, but it was still kind of warm, and it was too sticky.

437
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:37,785
Rym: We had the fan.

438
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:38,429
Rym: we had to fan it.

439
00:25:38,952 --> 00:25:40,300
Scott: Yeah, we didn't fan it enough.

440
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:42,933
Scott: It was too sticky, and it was too sort of heavy and dense.

441
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,180
Scott: it needed to be a little bit lighter.

442
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:46,860
Rym: It was it tasted it works.

443
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:55,912
Rym: The sushi we made was one step above Mediocre deli sushi yeah, but it was definitely not restaurant sushi.

444
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,220
Scott: No, but there are hints of restaurant sushi in there.

445
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,622
Rym: Yeah, those uh I think the the Philly roll was probably the best roll We made.

446
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:06,420
Scott: the thing was it like I felt like I had a little too much cream cheese at least the one that I ate.

447
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,263
Rym: Yeah, mine was fine.

448
00:26:07,303 --> 00:26:09,874
Rym: I think the cream cheese distribution was not uniform.

449
00:26:10,055 --> 00:26:12,123
Scott: Yeah, see that's another thing right It's all about.

450
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:15,636
Scott: so you take the seaweed and you put the rice on the seaweed.

451
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:18,550
Scott: now that actually is Significantly more difficult than you would think.

452
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:24,380
Scott: you had to get it out perfectly evenly But leave a little space at the end for the seaweed like you know to glue to itself.

453
00:26:24,621 --> 00:26:26,929
Rym: I think the biggest mistake you made was the first roll you made.

454
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:29,760
Rym: you made one of those inside-out like wraparound rolls.

455
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:30,824
Scott: Yeah, you cannot.

456
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:34,337
Scott: It's easier to do seaweed on the outside than seaweed on the inside.

457
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:35,160
Rym: Yeah, it's funny.

458
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,891
Rym: You look at our rolls.

459
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:36,419
Rym: We have some video.

460
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:41,289
Rym: I'll put it up when I get a chance, but basically the first roll we made looked pretty awful But was actually really good.

461
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,238
Rym: just had too much rice in it.

462
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:50,713
Rym: Every roll got better and better and better and then like the last roll the second to last roll We made was awesome, and then we were running low on rice and the last roll.

463
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:52,218
Rym: We made was as bad as the first roll.

464
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,491
Scott: yeah Another thing is.

465
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:56,200
Scott: you got to really work.

466
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,700
Scott: You know I'm sure with much practice you could figure out the exact proportion of things to put in the roll, right?

467
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,000
Scott: It's like and also the length of the seaweed.

468
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,442
Scott: It's like.

469
00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:12,780
Scott: you know you the seaweed is this long which means it's gonna roll up You know to be nice at this diameter, which means you got to fill it with this much stuff.

470
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,320
Scott: Otherwise you get one that's like too fat too thin not enough stuff in it too much stuff in it.

471
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,265
Scott: You can't close it.

472
00:27:18,728 --> 00:27:19,251
Scott: You know it's.

473
00:27:19,452 --> 00:27:19,654
Scott: it's.

474
00:27:20,257 --> 00:27:22,980
Scott: it's tricky And I think you know you got to get a lot of practice in fig.

475
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,875
Scott: You know you'll get a feel for exactly how how deep you know how thick the rice should be.

476
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:28,839
Scott: you know how.

477
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:29,280
Scott: you know?

478
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,688
Scott: What size the seaweed should be how much stuff to put in it?

479
00:27:31,888 --> 00:27:35,139
Scott: all that you know takes a while practice learning?

480
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,691
Scott: But yeah You know making sushi actually isn't that hard.

481
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:41,219
Scott: you get a little wooden mat that rolls up.

482
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:46,406
Scott: You put seaweed you put rice in the seaweed you put stuff on the rice you roll it up And then you chop it.

483
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:48,092
Scott: the chopping is actually pretty easy.

484
00:27:48,694 --> 00:27:48,855
Rym: Yep.

485
00:27:48,955 --> 00:27:50,280
Rym: We needed a sharper knife.

486
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,642
Rym: I think.

487
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:53,799
Rym: yeah, we had better luck with that serrated one than with the chopping.

488
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:56,312
Scott: yeah We didn't have an appropriate knife for the chopping.

489
00:27:56,533 --> 00:28:00,557
Scott: I mean I had one in my house, but Yeah, you want to make sure the knife is pretty sharp.

490
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:04,540
Scott: otherwise You're gonna smush the roll when you try to cut it into little smaller rolls.

491
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:05,650
Rym: I feel like we do this again.

492
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,618
Rym: It'll be pretty fucking awesome.

493
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:14,020
Scott: though I also feel like we should make you know the cone Style where you just have a cone of seaweed and you jam a bunch of crap in there because then you don't have to.

494
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,558
Rym: I think that might actually be a lot harder you think.

495
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:20,660
Rym: so Yeah, those those rolls are a little more complex looking in terms of construction.

496
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:24,396
Rym: Yeah, cuz I mean otherwise if you just make a cone and dump crap in there.

497
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,019
Rym: how you gonna eat that?

498
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:28,020
Scott: The same way you eat it when you order it at the restaurant.

499
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:30,540
Rym: Yeah, and it's actually kind of arranged when you order at the restaurant.

500
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,570
Rym: Okay, it's not just thrown into a cone.

501
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:38,469
Scott: the other thing is you know we tried to make the kind You know the sashimi kind where you just have the ball of rice Put something on top of it, and that's it.

502
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:40,460
Rym: that was actually way harder than making the roll.

503
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:42,059
Scott: Yeah, it's like you thought that would be easy.

504
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:51,210
Scott: But actually because the rice wasn't so perfect you it wasn't easy to make that little ball of rice exactly the right shape and size And consistency to lay the little piece of.

505
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:52,899
Scott: you know whatever it is on top of it.

506
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:59,474
Scott: But if you could get the ball of rice to be exactly right Then you could just take a little strip of seaweed and wrap it around like a little belt.

507
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:00,619
Scott: that was actually pretty easy to do.

508
00:29:01,362 --> 00:29:04,031
Scott: But then the rice fell apart because it wasn't exactly right.

509
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:06,820
Scott: so pretty much everything hinges on that rice.

510
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:11,970
Scott: You don't realize it when you eat the sushi because when you're buying when you're buying sushis You know you don't think about the rice.

511
00:29:12,212 --> 00:29:13,340
Scott: you think about the other parts.

512
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:13,702
Scott: It's like.

513
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:14,144
Scott: you know.

514
00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:15,733
Scott: do I want to buy this roll or that roll?

515
00:29:15,793 --> 00:29:15,854
Scott: or?

516
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:16,900
Scott: and they all have rice in them.

517
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:19,708
Scott: But the rice is actually the most important thing.

518
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:23,599
Scott: get the rice right and then everything else will be ten times better.

519
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:29,932
Scott: So I think next time when we do it I'm gonna you know we're gonna try to do the rice just like in the video.

520
00:29:29,992 --> 00:29:30,976
Scott: do not you know?

521
00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:36,140
Scott: try to cut any corners On it gonna spin, but a lot more time and effort into the rice making much more important.

522
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:41,300
Rym: I'm making buterol first not last yeah, and then you know putting a lot.

523
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:45,369
Scott: You know less well, I guess you know not less effort But you know I'm gonna basically.

524
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,699
Scott: but most of the attention on to the rice.

525
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,500
Rym: I'll have to do a. maybe we'll do a sushi party with the crew have some more people over not just us.

526
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,825
Scott: Yeah, they'll have to get a lot more.

527
00:29:51,865 --> 00:29:53,672
Scott: Let's get like two rice cookers going.

528
00:29:53,712 --> 00:29:56,883
Rym: Yeah, I think one rice cooker We'll be fine.

529
00:29:57,184 --> 00:29:57,746
Scott: run it twice.

530
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:58,669
Rym: Just fill it.

531
00:29:58,729 --> 00:29:59,572
Rym: We didn't fill it.

532
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:00,716
Rym: It wasn't that much rice.

533
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:01,418
Scott: Oh, we didn't fill it.

534
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,183
Rym: no We filled it.

535
00:30:03,224 --> 00:30:04,750
Rym: it would practically fill this apartment.

536
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,578
Rym: you know much rice comes out of a full rice cooker.

537
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:08,066
Scott: a lot Yeah, zillion.

538
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,119
Scott: I mean I make half a cup of rice, and that's a lot for one.

539
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,219
Rym: Maybe we need that big square kind of bucket the guy on YouTube was using.

540
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:18,796
Scott: well He had like a big wooden thing with a wooden paddle that he was using.

541
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:19,800
Scott: I don't know.

542
00:30:20,682 --> 00:30:22,253
Scott: But yeah go on YouTube and make.

543
00:30:22,313 --> 00:30:32,480
Scott: if you want to do this you know make sure you get the right techniques from YouTube, but Even though the rice you know didn't consist properly and was hard to make sushi with it tasted fine.

544
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:37,498
Scott: You know everything actually tasted just like it would taste just because the shape isn't beautiful.

545
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:38,983
Scott: and everything It's.

546
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,875
Scott: you still get the same mixture of ingredients in the same proportions.

547
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:43,040
Scott: It's still gonna have the same flavor.

548
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:44,588
Scott: Yeah, you know it's like you.

549
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:53,679
Scott: if you if you don't want to try to roll up the sushi Take a piece of seaweed plop a ball of rice on it Put a crab stick on top of it put it on a spoon and eat it.

550
00:30:54,443 --> 00:30:56,516
Scott: Put a drop of soy sauce on it, but it's you know.

551
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:58,263
Scott: eat it It'll taste like sushi.

552
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,112
Rym: also reminded me how much I really like crab sticks.

553
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:02,497
Scott: crab sticks are pretty good.

554
00:31:02,517 --> 00:31:04,315
Scott: Yeah crab stick.

555
00:31:11,274 --> 00:31:13,810
