1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,358
Rym: It's Tuesday, December 13th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:10,679
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,394
Rym: - I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:14,990
Rym: - And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,250
Rym: Tonight, Eminent Domain, the board game.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:23,940
Rym: - Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:24,350
Scott: - Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,480
Rym: I've said this before, and I'll probably say it a lot in the course of my life.

9
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,169
Scott: That you have a ton of opening bits?

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,561
Scott: I'm gonna count the pounds of opening bits and see if they add up to 2,000.

11
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:40,698
Rym: What I'm gonna say is that, to quote Ghostbusters, "I love this

12
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:41,079
Rym: town.".

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,366
Scott: - Okay.

14
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:43,320
Rym: - I mean, let's see, what did we do?

15
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:45,360
Rym: On Saturday, we went to the Nostalgia Train.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,155
Rym: We rode a subway car from the '30s.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,900
Scott: No, it's the Vintage Train, not the Nostalgia Train.

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,360
Rym: It was called the Nostalgia Train on the MTA website, Scott.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,220
Scott: It was called the Vintage Train on the MTA website.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,400
Rym: I'm gonna go, 'cause they called it the Nostalgia Train.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,859
Rym: They even made a big deal about, "Go shopping on the Nostalgia

22
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:58,020
Rym: Train.".

23
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,339
Rym: There was an ad on the MTA site saying, "Come ride the Nostalgia

24
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:02,480
Rym: Train.".

25
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,640
Rym: Christmas shopping.

26
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,877
Scott: This says, "Take a ride on a vintage

27
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:09,358
Scott: train.".

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,655
Scott: - Yes, it's called-- - "Take a ride on a vintage

29
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,100
Scott: subway.".

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,990
Scott: - Yes, a vintage subway.

31
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:13,600
Scott: - The vintage train runs.

32
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,160
Rym: The program is called the Nostalgia Train, because that's what they do every year.

33
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,600
Rym: That's the program where they make the train ready and run it every year.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,852
Rym: In fact, there's multiple news articles that say, quote, "MTA brings back the Nostalgia Train.

35
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:30,639
Scott: Come ride the Vintage

36
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:30,960
Scott: Train.".

37
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:44,380
Scott: On the official page, right, not only is "Vintage Train" in the URL, it says the word "Vintage Train" one, two, three, over six times, and it only says the word "Nostalgia" once on this entire page.

38
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,537
Rym: Ah, but the graphical ads say "The Nostalgia

39
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:46,800
Rym: Train."

40
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:51,778
Rym: Not on the official mta.info/metrocard/promo/vintagetrain/index.html.

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,760
Rym: Regardless, we rode a subway train from the '30s onward, and it was actually surprisingly similar to my current experience.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,956
Scott: I thought it was gonna be kinda cool, like, "Oh, worth

43
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:01,339
Scott: doing.".

44
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,259
Scott: It was actually way awesome.

45
00:02:03,903 --> 00:02:04,834
Scott: I thought it was gonna be like, "All

46
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:04,996
Scott: right.".

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,020
Rym: I was mostly pleased with the number of people who were completely and utterly dumbfounded as it pulled up, and they were afraid to get on it.

48
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,067
Scott: Yeah, that was the weird part.

49
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:15,190
Scott: It's like, if I saw that train pull up, I'd be like, "I don't care where the fuck this is

50
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:15,412
Scott: going.".

51
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:19,295
Scott: 'Cause I was like, "I'm hoping it'd go into, like,

52
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:19,999
Scott: Andromeda.".

53
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,836
Rym: 'Cause I was like, "Oh, please,

54
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:22,059
Rym: baby.".

55
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:22,840
Rym: Machine body?

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,656
Rym: Please.

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,617
Rym: I mean, even the garbage trains, I'm like, "Huh, I wonder where this'll take

58
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:27,678
Rym: me.".

59
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,980
Scott: Yeah, I'm not getting on the garbage train.

60
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:32,100
Rym: When they're empty, I wanna get on one, just see where it goes.

61
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:35,400
Rym: Granted, it might go, you know, the opposite of Andromeda is Garbage Planet.

62
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:41,720
Scott: You gotta stop at Garbage Planet on the way to, you know, whatever you wanna go to, La Metal or whatever.

63
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:47,776
Rym: You know, the doors are mostly the same, so, you know, I asked the conductor, because they were just loving the shit out of this, they were yelling, "All

64
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:48,239
Rym: aboard!".

65
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,420
Scott: Well, of course, they only give, like, the ultra-train nerdy conductors on that thing.

66
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,679
Scott: You know, they don't put the regular old M2 guys.

67
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,058
Rym: So I ask him, I'm like, "What if I try to hold this door

68
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:56,300
Rym: open?".

69
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:57,695
Rym: And he's like, "You will break your

70
00:02:57,715 --> 00:02:57,998
Rym: hand.".

71
00:02:58,223 --> 00:02:58,679
Scott: That's right.

72
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,656
Rym: "90 pounds of force from each

73
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:01,039
Rym: door."

74
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:01,440
Rym: I wish.

75
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:02,737
Rym: "And there's nothing to stop

76
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:02,839
Rym: it.".

77
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,980
Scott: And the new subway cars, right?

78
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,880
Scott: The little rubber bits in between the doors, where they bump into each other.

79
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:09,840
Scott: You know, they got a little flex to 'em.

80
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,040
Scott: I touched the rubber bits on the old doors.

81
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,340
Scott: They're basically rock hard, solid rubber that, like, you know, a car tire.

82
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,620
Rym: I kinda wanna go back to that, 'cause then people wouldn't be able to hold the fuckin' doors open.

83
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,543
Scott: I know, right?

84
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:22,592
Scott: And it's like, "Oh, you got stuck in the door.

85
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:23,134
Scott: You're dead.

86
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:23,938
Scott: Sorry.".

87
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:26,247
Rym: Not dead.

88
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:27,339
Rym: It wouldn't kill ya.

89
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,939
Scott: It would if the train started fuckin' movin'.

90
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:33,777
Rym: No, the MTA guy was like, "Yeah, we'd reopen it, but your wrist would be

91
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:34,139
Rym: broken.".

92
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,120
Rym: A lot of ankles got broken back in the day.

93
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,596
Rym: Nice.

94
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:41,839
Rym: But on Friday, Nerd NYC Board Game Night, we rocked it up.

95
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,460
Rym: On Thursday, we were at Nerd Night, like we talked about in all the meta moments, doing a lecture.

96
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:49,079
Rym: A 20-minute version of Losing Should Be Fun.

97
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,639
Scott: Which is pretty, actually, you know, I said all last time, like, "Hey, don't pay the money to go to Nerd Night to see

98
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:54,840
Scott: us.".

99
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:55,424
Scott: And you know what?

100
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:56,411
Scott: I was correct.

101
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:57,540
Scott: You shouldn't have paid to see us.

102
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:58,838
Scott: But there were two other things there.

103
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:00,657
Scott: Well worth paying for.

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,038
Rym: Yeah, the guy's lecture on, uh, molluscs.

105
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,659
Rym: Cephalopods are a subset of molluscs.

106
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,288
Scott: Yes, but it wasn't on.

107
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,360
Scott: The topic did not cover all of molluscs.

108
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,859
Scott: Oh, no, it didn't.

109
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,380
Scott: His talk was specific to cephalopods.

110
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,109
Rym: But he was pretty awesome, and I talked to him.

111
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,140
Rym: We're gonna try to get him to ConnectiCon.

112
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:16,658
Rym: Nice.

113
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,380
Rym: 'Cause the dude's never been to a con, but all his friends are.

114
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:26,180
Scott: The other dude who went after us did this thing using, like, dials, like they use for political stuff, but to evaluate OKCupid profiles.

115
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:33,800
Rym: I was dubious when he started, but then I realized that dial-based humor is one of the finest forms of humor.

116
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,880
Scott: We need to get those dials ASAP.

117
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,128
Rym: Oh my god, I'm working on getting those dials.

118
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,920
Rym: I want to do something with them at ConnectiCon, at PAX, and anywhere.

119
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,900
Scott: We're gonna rock the dials.

120
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,694
Rym: Oh my god, we're gonna have panels that are just like, "Yeah, dials!

121
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:44,398
Scott: Turn

122
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:44,538
Scott: 'em!".

123
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,598
Scott: We need to make a board game, video game, everything.

124
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,754
Scott: But seriously, we had no idea- Ooh, in fact, we should make an app for your phone.

125
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:51,580
Scott: that is just the dial.

126
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:52,980
Rym: Oh, that'd be perfect.

127
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,639
Scott: Yup, if it doesn't already exist.

128
00:04:54,941 --> 00:05:00,819
Rym: So we had no idea what this thing was gonna be like, but basically, you know, we get to this club, and it was really rockin'.

129
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,799
Rym: Like, there were a ton of classy, nerdy people there having cocktails.

130
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,059
Rym: Yeah, mostly attractive ladies.

131
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:07,580
Rym: Mostly.

132
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,200
Rym: Hanging out, everyone's cool, everyone's smart, everyone's debating and talking, except for the one rowdy table.

133
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:25,180
Scott: Well, I think upstairs on the left were actual OKCupid employees who came, 'cause they must've heard about it, and then there was another rowdy table of people who worked at the same company as the guy who was doing OKCupid talk, but he did not work for OKCupid.

134
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:25,940
Scott: Yup.

135
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:33,320
Rym: But, uh, so we get in, and one, the main reason I was impressed, we were actually on the list.

136
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:33,847
Scott: Yeah.

137
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,580
Rym: I cannot tell you how many people invite us to things, and don't put us on whatever fuckin' list they've got.

138
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,337
Scott: Even MagFest, the first year we went.

139
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,460
Scott: And both of us were on the list, and we were actually correctly on the list.

140
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,540
Scott: It wasn't, it didn't list, like, something else, or, you know, just the word GeekNights, or anything dumb like that.

141
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Rym: Everyone was smart, everyone was cool, and the place smelled like chlorine.

142
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:53,899
Rym: I'm like, what's up with this?

143
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:54,720
Rym: What's that smell?

144
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,240
Rym: Then I realized that all the tables are on little islands, and there's a little, like, bridge over just a floor of water.

145
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:02,880
Scott: Yeah, it's a pretty cool space.

146
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,740
Rym: It's also apparently pretty easy to get that space, so, uh, Relatively.

147
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,480
Rym: Look forward to a GeekNights themed event there in the near future.

148
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,020
Scott: Well, we need to, I think you can only get that space as long as you have at least a hundred people, and those people wanna drink.

149
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:16,839
Rym: I'm well aware.

150
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,818
Scott: Then you can get that space pretty easily.

151
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:20,257
Rym: I think I will get that space.

152
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,620
Scott: On a, on a, on a weeknight.

153
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:30,399
Rym: Much like how Luke Crane was able to double his power by combining with Vincent Baker for Burning Apocalypse, GeekNights could team up with some people to do a thing.

154
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,339
Scott: Get a hundred people to get drunk?

155
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:33,878
Rym: I think we could get a hundred people.

156
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,579
Scott: On a weekday night in New York?

157
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:36,240
Rym: Yeah.

158
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,067
Scott: Alright.

159
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,879
Rym: Because remember, the real reason to live in New York is not for the stuff that happens on the weekend, because everyone's life revolves on the weekends.

160
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:52,439
Rym: The whole point of living here is that stuff happens on the weekdays, usually the more awesome stuff, and if you live here, it's really the only way to do that stuff.

161
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,038
Scott: Yep.

162
00:06:53,662 --> 00:07:01,460
Scott: Or to be so rich that- If you don't live in the city, then if you try to do a weekday event after work, even if you work here, going home sucks balls.

163
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,025
Rym: Like you can tell, like all the

164
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:03,949
Scott: people who run like

165
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:16,480
Rym: clubs or night, you know, restaurants, like nice places, they complain mostly about the weekend crowd, because it's all the commuters and the out of towners, but the real quote unquote, no true Scotsman city culture is Monday through Thursday.

166
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:17,110
Rym: Mm-hmm.

167
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:18,740
Rym: So yeah, the city's awesome.

168
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:19,259
Scott: Alright.

169
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,773
Rym: Got any news?

170
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:21,899
Scott: I do have news.

171
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:22,497
Rym: How do you?

172
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:30,020
Scott: You know how we always fantasize or, you know, complain about the lack of unfulfilled potential and all these people are making crappy games?

173
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,360
Rym: I believe we even did a panel that was little more than us ranting for an hour.

174
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,180
Scott: Yeah, why don't they make a Pokemon MMO?

175
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Scott: Why don't they make a this?

176
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,840
Rym: Why don't they make TIE Fighter 2?

177
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,635
Rym: Why don't they make Tribes 2 too?

178
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,720
Rym: Why don't they just remake fucking Rampart plus Minecraft?

179
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,696
Scott: Well, none of those have been made, but somebody has made something.

180
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:47,660
Scott: that is the awesome.

181
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:49,380
Scott: Ahem.

182
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,520
Scott: I present to you Bandai Namco Mobile Suit Gundam Online.

183
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,320
Scott: What this is, it is a Gundam game, video game, obviously.

184
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,998
Scott: It is online, obviously.

185
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:02,316
Scott: Is it an MMO?

186
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:04,157
Scott: No, it is not an MMO.

187
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,600
Scott: It's simply Gundam Battle.

188
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,966
Scott: 52 versus 52.

189
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:09,238
Scott: Go.

190
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:11,160
Scott: All in the same map.

191
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,260
Scott: 52 Gundams against 52 Gundams.

192
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,960
Scott: Zeon versus, you know, regular guys.

193
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,820
Scott: Earth Federation.

194
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:20,400
Rym: The real question is exactly what the controls are like.

195
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,815
Rym: Because that Gundam pod I played in Japan was Gundam.

196
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,460
Scott: Look at these screenshots.

197
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,600
Scott: As in, I would slide sideways.

198
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,340
Scott: Do these screenshots look like your Gundam pod game?

199
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,580
Rym: They... Those look almost exactly like the Gundam pod game.

200
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,080
Scott: I guess it's the home version of the Gundam pod game.

201
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,260
Scott: 52 versus 52.

202
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,640
Rym: There is one other thing it's going to lack.

203
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:43,740
Scott: But wasn't the Gundam pod game, I imagine it was first person, right?

204
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,519
Scott: It was first person.

205
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,120
Scott: This seems to be third person, more like a little virtual on.

206
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,200
Rym: It was first person in the Gundam and you had the two giant joysticks.

207
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,839
Scott: Well, this seems to just be the home version.

208
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,998
Rym: I don't know if I'm excited about it because...

209
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,760
Scott: Well, I think it's going to be hard to play if you're not in Japan.

210
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:00,780
Scott: And don't speak Japanese.

211
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,919
Rym: Every big game that's come out since Counter Strike has pissed me off.

212
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:13,460
Scott: Yeah, mostly Counter Strike Go is the only thing I'm really holding on to.

213
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,820
Scott: Everything else, take it or leave it.

214
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,000
Rym: Also, Scott, I found something.

215
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,960
Rym: There's a parallel MTA website.

216
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,838
Rym: MTEditInfo/nyct/service/events/nostalgiatrain.htm.

217
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,834
Scott: Uh oh.

218
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,700
Rym: That goes to basically the same site?

219
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:30,300
Rym: Anyway.

220
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:35,100
Rym: So, I want to talk about this game a little bit because I think we geek-bit it.

221
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,760
Rym: I don't know if I even linked to it because we had so little to say about it.

222
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,960
Rym: Gabe and Tycho, if any arcade, were pretty surprisingly excited about Burnout Crash.

223
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,920
Rym: I remember the other Burnouts being pretty fun to hang out and crash a car for four hours with friends.

224
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,520
Scott: And since it was an Xbox arcade game, I downloaded the free demo.

225
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,300
Scott: Because you can download a free demo of anything that's on Xbox.

226
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,579
Rym: It's an average 99 cent iPhone game that they're charging 10 bucks for.

227
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,240
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is, it's not even as good as other one dollar iPhone games.

228
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:04,500
Scott: It's not as good as Angry Birds.

229
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,660
Rym: I couldn't figure out, was I missing something?

230
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,039
Scott: Like, we played it and we're like, what?

231
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,520
Scott: People were going crazy over this game and how good it was.

232
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,280
Scott: And I was like, why is this game good again?

233
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:14,519
Rym: I mean, seriously, you don't even drive the car.

234
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:18,358
Rym: You kind of steer it shittily and slowly into the intersection once.

235
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:21,240
Scott: And then you press a button to make it explode.

236
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,320
Rym: Periodically.

237
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:28,120
Scott: Then you wait, and then you make the car explode again and move it while it's exploding and flying through the air from the explosion.

238
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,420
Scott: And then wait, and then explode it again.

239
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:33,820
Scott: And that's all you do, is explode the car over and over again every time you push the button.

240
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,640
Rym: There was so little to it that I was utterly dumbfounded.

241
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,720
Rym: I did a lot of research to figure out if maybe I was missing something.

242
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:47,460
Scott: Yeah, I was sure I had to be missing something or I was in the wrong mode because everyone loved the fuck out of this.

243
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,660
Rym: But apparently, everyone doesn't love the fuck out of it because the reviews are actually pretty scathing.

244
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,240
Rym: And pretty much everyone but Gabe and Tycho and a handful of people agree that it's not good at all.

245
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:01,415
Scott: It's weird, though.

246
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:07,800
Rym: It's not good for what it is in terms of being a console game that costs ten dollars.

247
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,480
Scott: Even if it was a dollar on the iPhone, like I said, there are other better dollar iPhone games.

248
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,339
Scott: There's other better free iPhone games.

249
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,640
Rym: I mean, the whole point of Burnout was not the high score.

250
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,160
Rym: It was seeing the crazy bullshit that happened and being the cause of it.

251
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,100
Scott: But to go crazy bullshit, you need to drive and crash and then drive again.

252
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,540
Scott: This, you drive a little bit and then you don't drive anymore.

253
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:26,765
Rym: I wouldn't even call it driving.

254
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:29,416
Rym: You steer a tank slowly into an intersection.

255
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,820
Scott: See, what I would like to see would be more like some of the modes they had in the original Burnout.

256
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,738
Scott: And just simplify them and streamline them and make them a little more arcade-y.

257
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,107
Scott: So it's like, make the driving really easy.

258
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:44,500
Scott: Give me sort of a twisty road to drive down.

259
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,085
Scott: Give me some missiles to shoot.

260
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:53,720
Scott: And after I shoot all my missiles at different things, Spy Hunter style, I crash into something and then we add up the score from the whole thing and then I can drive again.

261
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,049
Scott: You know, that would be kind of cool.

262
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:57,496
Scott: Or maybe some multiplayer.

263
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:57,898
Scott: I don't know.

264
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,060
Rym: Never mind the fact that, you know, I'm not one to complain.

265
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,140
Scott: I'm talking about for an Xbox arcade game, not for the phone.

266
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,040
Rym: I'm not one to complain about the metaphor of a game usually, at least not in this context.

267
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,467
Rym: Maybe in a lecture or something.

268
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,060
Rym: But the metaphor of the game is bullshit.

269
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,112
Rym: Like, it doesn't make any sense.

270
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,340
Rym: And I just, I don't get this game.

271
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,919
Scott: I do want to say one positive thing about the game.

272
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:22,276
Scott: It has some style, especially in the music.

273
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:22,558
Scott: Dr.

274
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:22,679
Scott: Beat.

275
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:25,288
Rym: Oh, it's got great style.

276
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:29,300
Rym: For a 99 cent iPhone game, it's pretty fucking great.

277
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,894
Scott: It actually has pretty good style for a $10 game.

278
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,799
Scott: But I'm not going to pay $10 for style when I can just go to YouTube and get style for free.

279
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:45,640
Rym: So I got one more little geek bite here because we played a game at the annual front row crew bacchanal in Philly called Beowulf.

280
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,360
Rym: Which, unsurprisingly, was a literal retelling of the story of Beowulf.

281
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,380
Scott: Yeah, you literally go event by event through the story of Beowulf and you have to play each event until you get to the end.

282
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,780
Scott: Until you see at the end who, which player was the Beowulfiest.

283
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,330
Rym: I'm not going to review it really because we played it once.

284
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,780
Rym: I haven't really fully formed my opinion on it yet.

285
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,747
Rym: I kind of liked it.

286
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,199
Rym: But here's the deal.

287
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:17,820
Rym: It has all the trappings of one of those crappy co-op games like Shadows Over Camelot or Battlestar Galactica.

288
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,739
Scott: But it's not a co-op game.

289
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,407
Rym: Well yeah, you could have let me finish.

290
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:21,250
Rym: I was building up to that.

291
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:22,294
Rym: That reveal.

292
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:23,680
Rym: I guess you spoiled it.

293
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:25,806
Rym: It has all the trappings of that.

294
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:30,100
Rym: Like the same kinds of cards and the same kinds of interactions and putting cards up.

295
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:41,920
Rym: But you're all straight up in competition with one another and it's basically a bid to see who gets fucked game.

296
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,580
Rym: Every round you bid and somebody gets fucked and hopefully it's not you but it's almost always you.

297
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:51,031
Scott: So basically you're going to have to get fucked sometimes.

298
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:53,400
Scott: so get fucked in the round where getting fucked isn't so bad.

299
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,939
Rym: But then again everyone's thinking that so it doesn't work so well.

300
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,520
Scott: Well then if everyone really bids low maybe you can win big in that round.

301
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,409
Scott: It's like well if I lose this round it's not so bad.

302
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,120
Scott: but wait that means everyone's going to be thinking that they're going to bid nothing.

303
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,680
Scott: I could bid one and take a huge prize in this round.

304
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,820
Rym: So the game devolved into random bullshit at the end but much like that horse racing game we played that one time.

305
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,388
Scott: Did I win?

306
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:17,040
Scott: I don't think I won.

307
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:19,060
Rym: It devolved, I think Chase won.

308
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,129
Scott: I think so.

309
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,800
Scott: I won something.

310
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:23,379
Scott: Oh I won eminent domain which we're going to talk about.

311
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,720
Rym: Yeah you did.

312
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,807
Rym: But the game devolved into random bullshit at the end.

313
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:31,260
Rym: but the random bullshit was surprisingly awesome and suspenseful.

314
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,099
Rym: Because basically if you run out of cards to bid with you can risk it.

315
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,155
Rym: And there's a mechanic where if you fail at the risk you're fucked.

316
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:40,280
Rym: You take a wound and you're out.

317
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,791
Scott: It's basically I need one more card to stay in this game.

318
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:46,400
Scott: Draw two and if you get the card you need you stay in.

319
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:50,560
Scott: And everyone runs out of cards and everyone just basically draws cards.

320
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,754
Rym: We went around like 20 times at the end of the game.

321
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:55,020
Rym: Like it was off the fucking hook.

322
00:14:55,482 --> 00:15:00,600
Scott: It's like I had the most cards just in my hand available so I pushed it way up.

323
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,440
Scott: And people kept risking it and managed to stay in the game even though I had outbid them from my hand.

324
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,012
Rym: This game had a great, as a result it had a great vibe where you build like "Ah!

325
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:11,035
Rym: Ah shit son!

326
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:11,516
Rym: Ah!

327
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:11,978
Rym: Ah!

328
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:12,379
Rym: Ah!"

329
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:23,700
Rym: And then someone would draw like two doubles and you'd see the person who had legitimately gotten that far with the hand they'd built and nurtured throughout the entire game against the guy pulling the random bullshit.

330
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,327
Rym: Look at you yell

331
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:25,790
Rym: "Fuck!"

332
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,460
Rym: and throw their hand down in disgust.

333
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:32,660
Rym: But I don't know if this is a good game but I will say this.

334
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:40,800
Rym: If you have a friend who knows the story of Beowulf like our friend Peter Olsen does and tells you the story as you play.

335
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:42,340
Rym: This game is amazing.

336
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,394
Scott: Pete's also had a really good interpretation.

337
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:46,420
Scott: It was very modern.

338
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:50,640
Rym: It was a great interpretation of Beowulf and that added a lot to the game.

339
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,560
Rym: I don't think I would have enjoyed it if I had just straight up played it like a board game.

340
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:58,218
Scott: Yeah that's why I was getting a little bleh and that's why I was like "Pete, what is this

341
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:58,459
Scott: thing?".

342
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,760
Rym: Now Scott, do you know who designed this game?

343
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:01,925
Scott: Nope.

344
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,640
Scott: Rainer Canisian?

345
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,708
Scott: Rainer Canisian!

346
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,299
Scott: I wouldn't have asked if it wasn't him.

347
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,488
Scott: He does those kinds of games.

348
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:08,039
Scott: He did the Lord of the Rings game.

349
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:12,660
Rym: I don't know if I can recommend this game or not but it's out there.

350
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,053
Scott: Maybe we'll do a show in it later.

351
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:14,539
Scott: Maybe a video.

352
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,240
Rym: We've got to play it at least one or two more times.

353
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,280
Rym: It did give us a good idea for another spin-off show like RFE though.

354
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:28,240
Rym: We know how to do the show where Pete tries to tell the story of Beowulf and we interrupt him with perhaps the stupidest questions humans have ever asked.

355
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,660
Scott: It doesn't matter because it still worked despite our stupid questions.

356
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,468
Rym: It worked really well actually.

357
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,940
Rym: Partly because Beowulf doesn't take shit from anyone.

358
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,839
Scott: That's right.

359
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,118
Rym: Scott would ask, "So why didn't he just fucking kill that

360
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:39,319
Rym: guy?".

361
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,468
Rym: And Pete would be like, "Hold on.

362
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,059
Scott: So Beowulf killed all of

363
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:42,240
Scott: them.".

364
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,394
Scott: "Why didn't he just hang out in the Denmark meat hall all the time after he rescued it?

365
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:47,699
Scott: Why would he go back to stupid Sweden?

366
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:47,819
Scott: It's

367
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:48,080
Scott: colder.".

368
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,813
Rym: So things of the day.

369
00:16:56,973 --> 00:17:06,770
Rym: If you have ever been to, in the last, I don't know, thirty to forty years, a strip club or a burlesque club or a gentleman's club or anything like that.

370
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:10,401
Rym: They are scary, seedy dens of losers.

371
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:13,390
Rym: They're pretty much some of the worst places you can go.

372
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:17,210
Scott: There have been some nerdy burlesques in the city which are relatively popular.

373
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,209
Rym: Ah, but that's what I'm getting to.

374
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,727
Scott: I'm personally not the biggest fan, but there are at least three of them, I think, if not more.

375
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:24,948
Scott: This is D21.

376
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,910
Scott: Many of our friends participate in them and enjoy them a great deal.

377
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,329
Rym: In fact, a friend of ours invited us to see one of them this weekend that she's in.

378
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:42,850
Rym: But anyway, so there's been a resurgence of burlesque, one, among nerds, like cosplay burlesque and all that, that is kind of harking back to my thing of the day.

379
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:56,830
Rym: Because back in the day, burlesque was surprisingly classy and, while being somewhat titillating, because these pictures are my thing of the day, pretty goddamn titillating.

380
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:02,550
Rym: One, they were adult women, which is, I guess, surprising compared to the modern era of taste in porn.

381
00:18:02,992 --> 00:18:06,490
Rym: And two, one of these pictures perhaps sums everything up to me.

382
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,130
Rym: It tells me that one, humans really haven't changed that much in the last hundred years.

383
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:18,790
Rym: But two, it tells me that the culture around pornography and mainstream gentlemen's clubs has changed a lot.

384
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:22,285
Rym: This is a picture from behind of D-Lite.

385
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,138
Rym: D-Lite.

386
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:28,329
Rym: She is a female impersonator.

387
00:18:29,415 --> 00:18:30,629
Rym: She looks like a woman from the back.

388
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:37,747
Rym: And she's dancing before an audience, it looks like straight up out of, I don't know, 1950s Americana.

389
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:46,570
Rym: And the audience is half women, and they're giggling and talking to each other, and the men are kind of laughing.

390
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:50,070
Rym: The audience reactions are pretty amazing.

391
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,330
Rym: If we could go back to this era of burlesque, I would be a very happy man.

392
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,890
Scott: Where going to a burlesque was like going to a regular movie theater, and there'd be a packed house.

393
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,790
Scott: But remember, in those days it was much more boring, and you couldn't get internet porn.

394
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:06,710
Rym: But dude, this is like 40 year old women with their friends giggling at the female impersonator.

395
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:08,768
Scott: Here's the thing you understand, right?

396
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,910
Scott: First they invented VHS porn, and they invented porno mags, which meant you could take them home in private.

397
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,970
Scott: And then they invented internet porn, so you didn't have to go to the porn store.

398
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:25,449
Scott: Before all those inventions, when say a porno mag would get banned because it was the olden days, right?

399
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:31,769
Scott: You had to go to a place, and everyone would have to go to the place at the same time, because the show was at the same time.

400
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,547
Scott: So everyone would go to the place, and you would go, and you would see everyone there, and you'd be like,

401
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:36,908
Scott: "Yeah!".

402
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:41,509
Scott: But now, because we can keep it private, people do.

403
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:43,770
Rym: That's my hypothesis anyway.

404
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,413
Rym: What's the old joke?

405
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:48,469
Rym: It's something like Catholics don't recognize the legitimacy of the Eastern Orthodoxy.

406
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:51,850
Rym: Eastern Orthodox people don't recognize the legitimacy of the Pope.

407
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,903
Rym: Protestants don't recognize the legitimacy of Catholicism.

408
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,229
Rym: And Southern Baptists don't recognize each other in the liquor store.

409
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:03,749
Rym: Something along those lines.

410
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,410
Rym: I don't know, I look forward to this resurgence growing, and I kind of like this geeky, because it seems like steampunk culture.

411
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,410
Scott: Well then do Mormons not recognize each other at Starbucks?

412
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:18,310
Rym: I feel like the steampunk, anime, cosplay cultures are starting to overlap.

413
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,390
Scott: Jews don't recognize each other at the barbecue?

414
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:24,430
Rym: With this kind of resurgence of classical burlesque?

415
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:28,470
Rym: And I hope that the next thing to come back is vaudeville!

416
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,067
Scott: Yeah, no.

417
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:32,829
Rym: Maybe Gershwin-style reviews?

418
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:35,010
Scott: You can go see one right now if you want.

419
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,045
Rym: I can actually, I'm thinking about it.

420
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:36,330
Rym: Anyway.

421
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:38,270
Rym: Anyway.

422
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:39,558
Scott: Anyway what?

423
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,328
Scott: Oh, Things of the Day?

424
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:41,459
Scott: Yeah!

425
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,108
Scott: Alright, anyone you might remember, I did a Thing of the Day some many months ago.

426
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:48,649
Scott: With the girls.

427
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,129
Scott: And it was very catchy, and I infected many people.

428
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,309
Rym: Is this what, your second favorite thing right now?

429
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,410
Scott: Yeah, probably.

430
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:00,507
Scott: So recently, right?

431
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,030
Rym: Don't get me wrong, I'm not making fun.

432
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:08,710
Rym: I am with Scott on these girls, but same as with ponies, I'm not at the level of Scott.

433
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:10,536
Rym: I'm close!

434
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:11,462
Rym: I'm like 85% there.

435
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:18,990
Scott: So basically the deal is, it's not that I'm actually, I don't like them that much.

436
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:21,969
Scott: Like I'm a fan, but I kinda like it.

437
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:25,329
Scott: But it's more that I'm just so fascinated by it.

438
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,086
Scott: It's like, this is company SM Entertainment, and they manufactured these musical groups.

439
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,850
Scott: But the musical groups don't, they can sing and dance, but they don't write music or create anything.

440
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:41,290
Scott: And it's almost like Hatsune Miku, it's like the reverse of Hatsune Miku.

441
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:47,610
Scott: Imagine a distant future where people can't even remember that people would actually sing because computers do all the singing.

442
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:53,630
Scott: So somebody takes a person and trains them like an Olympic gymnast from when they're zero to do singing and dancing.

443
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,809
Scott: And people are like amazed because they've only ever seen virtual idols.

444
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,608
Scott: And something is a real one.

445
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:03,867
Scott: So this company put together nine girls, it's Girls Generation, SNSD.

446
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:10,150
Scott: And they recently had some new songs and new albums, so they're exploding again.

447
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:15,150
Scott: And they were in Madison Square Garden, they came to New York, and they're sort of taking over the world.

448
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:24,398
Scott: And the reason I thought of them again, because I hadn't thought about them in months since they were my thing of the day previously, was that I'm sitting there and I'm like, huh,

449
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:24,739
Rym: every

450
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:30,110
Scott: time I think something's cool, after like six to twelve months, it becomes even more cooler.

451
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,039
Scott: Like I was into ponies before everyone else.

452
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,610
Scott: I was into DDR before everyone else.

453
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,870
Rym: I want to point out, we were into ponies pretty early.

454
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,049
Scott: I know, that's what I'm saying.

455
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:41,670
Scott: Not before everyone.

456
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,489
Rym: Much of the first season, a surprising percentage of it.

457
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,456
Scott: About half.

458
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:47,570
Scott: We were halfway through season one.

459
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:52,130
Rym: And we got into it afterward because so many people were like, you gotta watch this.

460
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,079
Rym: And we were like, really?

461
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:53,221
Scott: Really?

462
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:56,890
Scott: I'm just saying, we were into it pretty early compared to most.

463
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,030
Scott: Before the exponential explosion.

464
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:02,210
Scott: Before it was on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, right?

465
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,510
Scott: We were into DDR before it was in early arcades.

466
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,990
Rym: So Scott, are you saying that SND is going to be the next big thing?

467
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,461
Scott: It's SNSD.

468
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:14,370
Scott: I'm saying that I was trying to think, what is there that I liked that is going to be big?

469
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,150
Scott: And I was like, the girls.

470
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,501
Rym: The girls, Jerry.

471
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:18,130
Rym: The girls.

472
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:19,834
Scott: And I was right.

473
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:23,949
Scott: If you go look at their stock in the Korean exchange, it's pretty much LA.

474
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:25,419
Scott: A log.

475
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,209
Scott: It just goes whoop.

476
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,170
Rym: If I had known that I could invest in them when Scott first pointed them out, I would have.

477
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,872
Scott: Yeah.

478
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:33,079
Scott: Well, I don't know if you can.

479
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,770
Scott: I think you'd have to go to the Korean exchange.

480
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:36,250
Rym: No, if there's an ADR, I can.

481
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,078
Scott: I couldn't find an ADR for it.

482
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:40,630
Scott: I looked a little bit, but I don't know how to search for that thing anyway.

483
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:47,070
Scott: So, yeah, they've got a new song and a new everything and it's pretty catchy and, you know, the usual.

484
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:48,168
Scott: That's how it goes.

485
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,353
Scott: And so here they are.

486
00:23:51,373 --> 00:23:59,190
Scott: This video, which my thing of the day is, is from a thing called MAMA, which is the Mnet Something Music Awards, which is basically Korean Grammys.

487
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:00,209
Scott: That's all you have to know about it.

488
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:02,870
Scott: For some reason, the Korean Grammys were in Singapore.

489
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:08,530
Scott: And for some reason, in 2010, the red line will also be there.

490
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,632
Scott: Right.

491
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:17,430
Scott: 2010, the company, SM Entertainment, that does all these these girls and guys and whatever, was boycotting the MAMA for some reason.

492
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:17,934
Scott: I don't know.

493
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:18,923
Scott: It's on Wikipedia.

494
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:19,710
Scott: You can learn it yourself.

495
00:24:20,073 --> 00:24:21,566
Scott: But in 2011, they went and they went hardcore.

496
00:24:23,352 --> 00:24:25,550
Scott: So they did some crazy remix.

497
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:34,330
Scott: And the thing that I find most interesting is not only, you know, does the girls mess up, which is pretty fascinating, because it's sort of like watching the Olympic gymnast fall off the balance beam.

498
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,233
Rym: It was pretty fascinating.

499
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,164
Rym: when Scott shows me this video and he's like, wait, wait, wait, that one's going to mess up.

500
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:38,445
Rym: Ready?

501
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:39,670
Rym: One, two, bam.

502
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,324
Scott: Because it's like, you know, Olympic gymnast falling off the balance beam.

503
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:44,370
Scott: It doesn't happen that often.

504
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:49,110
Rym: Well, in our lifetime, we're going to see the complete Sharon Apple and it won't even matter anymore.

505
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:49,573
Scott: I know.

506
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:50,849
Scott: That's what I'm saying is the prelude.

507
00:24:51,930 --> 00:25:00,010
Scott: So but not only do they do a remix and stuff, but for some reason, the Korean Grammys are like this crazy concert that normal people go to.

508
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:02,500
Scott: You know, if you can't go to the Grammy Awards in the

509
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:02,842
Scott: U.S.,

510
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:04,107
Scott: you can't just buy a fucking ticket.

511
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,790
Scott: Right?

512
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:08,390
Scott: It's all famous people from the bottom to the top inside of a theater.

513
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:14,350
Scott: This is outside at an arena with the long stage, like for a real concert where they can, you know, march out into the crowd.

514
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:16,930
Scott: And most of the people there are just screaming fans.

515
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:28,250
Scott: And I think if I was in charge of the MPAA or not the RAA, whatever, you know, the recording academy, I would definitely make the Grammys an outdoor concert.

516
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,045
Scott: Wait, wait, wait.

517
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,390
Scott: And not a theater, you know, clappy high school award night.

518
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,470
Rym: Recording academy.

519
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,534
Scott: Whatever it is.

520
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:35,843
Scott: I don't know.

521
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:36,910
Scott: Who gives out the Grammy Awards?

522
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,230
Scott: The assholes.

523
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,130
Rym: So in the meta moment, the Book Club book is a double book.

524
00:25:45,574 --> 00:25:46,189
Rym: Double book.

525
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,289
Rym: Two books by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

526
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:50,270
Scott: I think it's Egyptéry.

527
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,250
Rym: I said it this time because I have an anecdote.

528
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,805
Rym: I started reading, like I started Wind, Sand, and Stars a while ago, but then I kind of stopped.

529
00:25:57,825 --> 00:25:59,010
Rym: I was busy, so I picked it up again.

530
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:01,470
Rym: I've been blowing through it because it's fucking brilliant.

531
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,174
Scott: No kidding.

532
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,969
Scott: I'm not picking shit here.

533
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,410
Rym: Yeah.

534
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:10,010
Rym: I'm not going to say whether or not it's more or less brilliant than The Little Prince because that's what our show is for.

535
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:11,499
Rym: But I will say this.

536
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,609
Rym: I had it in my pocket, right?

537
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:14,630
Rym: And I was standing in the elevator in my building.

538
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:17,049
Rym: The top was sticking out.

539
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,289
Scott: There was a French guy on the...

540
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,838
Rym: No, and it was just the guy's name.

541
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:20,883
Rym: The author's name.

542
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:22,150
Rym: It wasn't the name of the book or anything.

543
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:28,664
Rym: And a girl in the elevator looks and says, "Oh, I would guess it was The Little Prince, but that is far too thick.

544
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:30,088
Rym: Is it perhaps Wind, Sand, and

545
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:30,489
Rym: Stars?".

546
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:32,135
Rym: And I said, "Why,

547
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:32,498
Rym: yes.".

548
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:34,610
Rym: And we started talking and it was great.

549
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,290
Scott: How come girls like that don't bother me in the elevator?

550
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,930
Rym: So, I was on the subway on the way home just now from my midtown.

551
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:45,761
Rym: I was reading it and someone interrupts me and says, "Excuse me.

552
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:47,387
Rym: Is that the same guy who wrote The Little

553
00:26:47,427 --> 00:26:47,688
Rym: Prince?".

554
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:49,639
Rym: And I was like, "Why, yes it is.

555
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,968
Rym: You should read this if you like The Little

556
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,210
Rym: Prince.".

557
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,930
Rym: And he just went on about how The Little Prince was, like, transformative to his life.

558
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,558
Scott: Well, it is.

559
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,330
Scott: That's the point.

560
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:05,710
Rym: This is a pretty damn good book, so if you needed no further reason to read it, carry it around with you because girls may hit on you.

561
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,317
Scott: Oh, shit.

562
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:06,929
Scott: I'm doing that now.

563
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:10,148
Scott: Other meta moments.

564
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,030
Scott: Magfest, baby!

565
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:15,290
Rym: I gotta practice that shit.

566
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,250
Scott: That's right, but don't kill the voice, though.

567
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:25,210
Rym: And it is confirmed, so I think I'm going to say, I don't know if it's on the website yet, but we are doing three panels at Magfest.

568
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,030
Scott: Most likely.

569
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,273
Rym: Well, no, it's confirmed.

570
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:29,419
Rym: We are doing one, our own lecture.

571
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,830
Rym: Remember Beyond Dungeons and Dragons, the first big lecture we did?

572
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,730
Scott: Advanced Beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

573
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,652
Rym: Second edition.

574
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:41,830
Rym: We're basically completely redoing that panel again because our bag of tricks is, like, brand new to these babies at Magfest.

575
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:42,370
Rym: That's right.

576
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:53,230
Rym: We are going to be on The Moneymaking Game with two other very intelligent people who are probably going to poke amazing holes in any argument we even attempt to make.

577
00:27:54,051 --> 00:28:00,370
Rym: And we are going to be on Gamer Motivations with a similar group of very intelligent people in the gaming industry.

578
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:03,689
Rym: I feel like we're going to get hosed, but I think it'll be fun.

579
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:07,690
Scott: Most of the time, we're going to be playing fucking games.

580
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,385
Scott: So if you go to Magfest, don't even come to our stupid panels.

581
00:28:10,445 --> 00:28:11,270
Scott: Just go to the arcade.

582
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:12,650
Scott: And play games.

583
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:20,430
Rym: Many of you met us at PAX or ConnectiCon, and if you want to hang out with us at a con, those are the worst possible cons to try to talk to us.

584
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,870
Scott: I think my goal at Magfest is to beat ice cold beer.

585
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:27,490
Rym: You're going to do that?

586
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,678
Scott: I'm just going to stand there, because you get to play all night, right?

587
00:28:30,738 --> 00:28:35,210
Scott: So once night rolls around, I'm going to go over to that, and I'm just going to drink the ice cold beer.

588
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,353
Rym: I will trade you then.

589
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:42,550
Rym: My goal is to beat any of the challenges beyond the easiest ones in that challenge arena.

590
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:47,030
Scott: I did the Carmen Sandiego one, so it has to be one that has a rating of at least hard.

591
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,870
Rym: Oh no, I did the Bionic Commando one next to you.

592
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,045
Scott: That's like if I did the Mega Man one.

593
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,509
Scott: That's bullshit.

594
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,410
Rym: Scott, the Carmen Sandiego one was trivial.

595
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:01,402
Scott: I'm just saying that the Carmen Sandiego one wouldn't count.

596
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:03,090
Scott: You have to do one that we both agree counts.

597
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:03,492
Scott: Yes.

598
00:29:04,214 --> 00:29:08,050
Rym: I feel like we should bring the belt and pass it back and forth all con.

599
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,210
Scott: Why don't we just keep scoring a logbook?

600
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,674
Rym: Seriously, go to Magfest.

601
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:15,340
Rym: Pre-reg ends in like three days.

602
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,579
Scott: And check us out on all the internet places.

603
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,450
Scott: Frontroadcrew.com, Facebook, Google+, Twitter.

604
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,572
Rym: I will link to it.

605
00:29:22,672 --> 00:29:32,450
Rym: Visit the GeekNights from YouTube account, because I've added a whole ton of videos, including most recently a bunch of footage from both the Penny Arcade Expo and Burning Apocalypse Con.

606
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:37,410
Scott: We're going to make some awesome videos at Magfest, perhaps of ice cold beer, perhaps of me beating ice cold beer.

607
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:42,069
Rym: Oh, you believe me, we're going to have video from Magfest, because I've got nothing better to do.

608
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:44,029
Rym: Except play games.

609
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:48,170
Rym: Alright Scott, we're going to do the show, we're going to keep listening to the girls.

610
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:54,850
Rym: You realize, kids, every time I have paused this recording to do anything, the girls have come out.

611
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,600
Scott: No, I've played other things before.

612
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,229
Scott: There was only just this one time.

613
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:00,578
Rym: So Eminent Domain.

614
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:02,749
Rym: I literally had never heard of it.

615
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:09,130
Scott: It's okay for the government to take your property, as long as they're using it for good, and it's like a slum or something.

616
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,509
Rym: I never heard of it until a guy showed it to me.

617
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,110
Rym: So we're at Nerd NYC, board game night, doing what we usually do, playing some games.

618
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:19,069
Rym: And we played some Marrakesh, which is always fun.

619
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,066
Scott: Carpets, baby.

620
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:22,329
Scott: Have we done a show about carpets?

621
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:23,739
Rym: I don't recall.

622
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,303
Rym: I think so.

623
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:25,190
Rym: Anyway.

624
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,005
Rym: And he was like, "Hey, you want to play Eminent Domain?

625
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:28,448
Rym: I brought a

626
00:30:28,488 --> 00:30:28,810
Rym: copy.".

627
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,570
Scott: And I said, "That's a game I've never heard of, so yes, I do want to play

628
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:31,630
Scott: it.".

629
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,658
Rym: No, we didn't say yes yet.

630
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:33,747
Rym: We were like, "What kind of game is

631
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:33,848
Rym: it?".

632
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,910
Scott: Pretty much any time someone says a game that I haven't played yet, as a suggestion, I'm basically saying yes.

633
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,290
Scott: But I'll question them out beforehand.

634
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:45,750
Rym: So here's how I would describe this game to someone who knows board games.

635
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:53,581
Rym: It is basically Race for the Galaxy went and had sex with... What's the old game?

636
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:54,288
Rym: he said it was?

637
00:30:55,491 --> 00:30:57,150
Scott: Rome Somethin' Somethin' that he couldn't remember the name of?

638
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,309
Rym: Yeah, Rome Somethin' has the same mechanics.

639
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,929
Rym: But it's basically Race for the Galaxy had sex with Dominion.

640
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:03,530
Scott: Right.

641
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:10,510
Scott: It's a typical card deck building game, but it's also like Puerto Rico Race for the Galaxy with the roll-taking mechanism.

642
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:18,450
Rym: But it also steals from this old Rome game where... Imagine if in Puerto Rico, someone picked a role, like the builder.

643
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:24,210
Rym: I could either build or descent, and if I descent, I get to take a coin instead, but I don't get to build.

644
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:30,130
Scott: So the mechanic in Puerto Rico is I take builder, I build, and because I took the builder, I build better.

645
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:34,270
Scott: Everyone else just builds, and if they don't build, they don't do anything.

646
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:40,670
Scott: In this game, if you choose a particular role on your turn, then you do it better.

647
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:46,830
Scott: Everyone else can do it, or if they don't do it, can draw a card in descent.

648
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,249
Scott: So it's like everyone always gets something, no matter what.

649
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:54,410
Scott: And the roles, unlike some of the other games, aren't exclusive.

650
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:59,270
Scott: Everyone can just keep researching over and over again and never do anything else but research.

651
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:00,789
Scott: It'd be dumb, but you could.

652
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:06,410
Rym: Before we get into the details of it, it has a really interesting mechanic.

653
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:11,469
Rym: Unlike in Race for the Galaxy, where you build your hand up, but you only really do stuff on your turn.

654
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,069
Rym: Or Dominion, where you throw your whole hand away every turn.

655
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:18,530
Rym: One, you can discard any number of cards at the end of your turn and draw back up to five.

656
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:27,310
Rym: But two, you get cards pretty much constantly throughout the game, because on anyone else's turn, you can piggyback on their action or descent.

657
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,810
Rym: And you piggyback on the action by playing cards that have the same action symbol.

658
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:42,190
Rym: So as a result, it has a really good sort of catch-up mechanic, in that if you're not able to do stuff because everyone else is playing in a different optimal pattern...

659
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,809
Scott: You're drawing a ton of fucking cards.

660
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,130
Rym: So on your turn now, you start with like ten cards in your hand, you do whatever the hell you want.

661
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,630
Scott: You have to be down to five at the end of your turn.

662
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:53,990
Scott: And you can actually go below five at the end of your turn.

663
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,910
Scott: You can discard as many as you want, but you don't have to discard all of them.

664
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:01,570
Scott: Just discard as many as you want down to five or less, and then you get to draw back up to five.

665
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:12,050
Scott: So it's really easy to go through your deck, and it's hard to clog it up, especially since it's really easy to use research cards to get rid of cards and get them out of the game.

666
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,870
Rym: Now it's not customizable like Dominion.

667
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,790
Rym: You're not making your set of cards to be out there.

668
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:20,929
Rym: You lay them all out, and there's a ton of them.

669
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:29,490
Rym: And while they're all unique, they pretty much come down to a very small number of types, and then each one has a slight twist from there.

670
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,828
Rym: But it's not nearly the problem set I thought it would be.

671
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:35,602
Rym: I mean, at first he pulls the game out, and I'm like, "What do you mean?

672
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:37,010
Rym: there's like a hundred unique cards?

673
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,387
Rym: This is bullshit, I have to have my eyes on

674
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:38,569
Rym: this?".

675
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:39,890
Scott: Yeah, how am I supposed to learn all these freaking cards?

676
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,830
Rym: No, they're all like improved research, improved colonization.

677
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,270
Scott: Yeah, and the thing is, most of the cards are not even accessible to you.

678
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:56,190
Scott: Like if your starting planet is a Saturn-type planet, then you're pretty much limited to only like three cards that you can get early in the game.

679
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,330
Scott: And most of the cards in the game you'll never be able to even try to get.

680
00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:03,030
Scott: The game will be over before you have a chance for those.

681
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:05,890
Scott: So you don't even have to worry about them, at least not in your first playthrough.

682
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,668
Scott: So you can start playing as a noob.

683
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:10,806
Scott: You don't need to read all the cards like you do in Dominion, where you have ten cards.

684
00:34:10,827 --> 00:34:11,370
Scott: you have to learn.

685
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:16,748
Scott: You can just read like three cards that are the ones that are going to be available to you, and worry about the other ones later.

686
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:28,190
Rym: Now the big part of that is that if your friends have played Dominion before, or any Dominion-like, and they've played either Race for the Galaxy or Puerto Rico, you almost don't have any rules to teach them.

687
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,469
Rym: This game is so straightforward.

688
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:35,489
Scott: Another thing I like about this game is that it comes with all these little plastic spaceships.

689
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:41,850
Scott: So it's like usually in a game, like Dominion, the way to get stuff in Dominion is with money.

690
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:45,469
Scott: So it's like you gotta find a way to make money to get stuff to get victory points.

691
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,609
Scott: And that's pretty much the chain.

692
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,610
Scott: It's like no matter what you need, you need money in buys.

693
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,481
Scott: In this game, you just need victory points.

694
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:04,030
Scott: And the two ways to get victory points, the big ones anyway, are to get more planets colonized, or to build, to produce goods and trade them.

695
00:35:04,991 --> 00:35:10,770
Scott: So what you can do is you can either get a few planets, and use those planets to produce and trade, and produce and trade, and produce and trade.

696
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,688
Rym: Which is what I did.

697
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:14,850
Scott: Or you can just try to get a ton of fucking planets.

698
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:18,210
Scott: Or you can try to do both those things in some combination.

699
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,750
Scott: Because those are pretty much the only ways to get a lot of victory points.

700
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,995
Rym: Yeah, now that's the big thing.

701
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:25,550
Rym: It removes the situation that many of these kinds of games have.

702
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:29,470
Rym: It's funny how Race for the Galaxy and Dominion both have this problem.

703
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,269
Rym: Not really a problem, but a sort of endgame, the DPT.

704
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,150
Rym: Dutchy Panic Time.

705
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:47,210
Rym: Where you know the game is wrapping up, so rather than continuing to crank your machine, or go for a big score, you basically start buying cards that you don't need just because they're worth like one or two victory points at the end of the game.

706
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:50,830
Rym: All the cards that do stuff in this game are worth bupkis.

707
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:51,471
Scott: Yup.

708
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:54,030
Scott: The only thing that's worth anything are those three things.

709
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:59,450
Scott: And what's kind of nice is that a lot of games I've played have multiple different strategies.

710
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:05,250
Scott: You can go for this, you can go for that, and all of those things will give you victory points.

711
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:10,610
Scott: But if you look, a lot of games, for example Kalis, some paths are so much more efficient than others.

712
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,541
Scott: Castle is the most efficient.

713
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:13,830
Scott: There are other ways.

714
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:19,830
Scott: You can try to do the jeweler, and the jeweler could win, but it's so much harder to make that jeweler happen.

715
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,269
Scott: It's got a totally different curve.

716
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:26,510
Scott: This game has three pretty much equal curves on three different victory paths.

717
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:33,930
Scott: So you just pick one of those paths, or some mix of them, and you can legitimately get a bunch of victory points.

718
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,010
Scott: Which means a lot of people can get a lot of victory points.

719
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:42,290
Scott: So it doesn't come down to who picks which path as much as it comes down to who does their path more efficiently.

720
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,916
Rym: Now you also can't cock block.

721
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:47,250
Rym: There's no direct attack, and there's no real indirect attack.

722
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,990
Scott: Yeah, which is sort of slightly annoying.

723
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,210
Rym: No, because instead it's an additive game instead of a subtractive game.

724
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,822
Rym: I mean, I like Agricola.

725
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:54,850
Rym: In fact, I love Agricola.

726
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:57,990
Scott: I kind of like dicking people, though, and I miss the ability to dick.

727
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,497
Rym: I'm also... here's the thing.

728
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:04,109
Rym: I like direct dicking games, but...

729
00:37:04,574 --> 00:37:05,390
Scott: Oh, that's how you swing.

730
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,910
Rym: The direct dicking games have a sort of fundamental gang up on the leader problem.

731
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,948
Scott: Gang it up, huh?

732
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:18,910
Rym: And you can see why, as you look through the years, direct dicking was replaced by subtractive dicking.

733
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:20,278
Scott: Looking through the years.

734
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:21,024
Scott: Lemon party, huh?

735
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,970
Rym: It's not where I'll attack Scott and take his sheep.

736
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:32,150
Rym: Instead, it's where I will go on the space that I know Scott had to go on so he can't get the sheep that he needed.

737
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:32,848
Scott: With my sheep?

738
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,990
Rym: The indirect dicking.

739
00:37:34,931 --> 00:37:36,409
Scott: Directly dicking my sheep where I had to go?

740
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:39,596
Rym: Instead, it's the opposite of dicking.

741
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:53,010
Rym: It's the positive flow, where instead of trying to figure out what the other guy wants to do and denying it to him, you figure out what you want to do, you figure out what he wants to do, and you try to chart a path where he can't ride on your coattails.

742
00:37:54,713 --> 00:38:00,990
Rym: So, I know he's trying to build up his military, so I'm not going to play a military action that lets him ride on.

743
00:38:01,371 --> 00:38:06,370
Rym: I'm going to use actions to do my military, I'll let him use the rolls, and I'll ride on his coattails instead.

744
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:07,770
Scott: You like to ride?

745
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:16,909
Rym: No, I said actions, because there's one other major mechanic, and this is kind of the coup for this game, that put it from "this is pretty cool" to "I bought it on Amazon as soon as I got

746
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:17,089
Rym: home.".

747
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:18,070
Scott: Also, it's cheap.

748
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:18,676
Rym: Yeah, it's like $20-$25.

749
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,018
Rym: Awesome.

750
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,690
Scott: Great price.

751
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:30,790
Rym: Now, supposedly it was a Kickstarter game, and there's an expansion, there's bits for the expansion in the box, but the game does not come with...

752
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,430
Scott: I think the expansion was a Kickstarter bonus.

753
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:40,290
Rym: Yeah, there's goods, like types of goods, on the planets in the game, but in the game we played, those don't mean anything.

754
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:48,190
Rym: But I believe they mean something with the expansion, I wasn't 100% clear on that, we have to play it again once it arrives, which might be tomorrow.

755
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:59,730
Rym: But, you don't just have rolls, every card has a roll, or an action, and on your turn, you play an action, which is just you, and then you play a roll.

756
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:10,150
Scott: Right, you don't have to do the action, and a lot of times, there's no reason to do the same thing as an action and a roll, because the roll encompasses the action.

757
00:39:11,253 --> 00:39:13,210
Scott: So the action is always going to be different than the roll.

758
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:24,630
Rym: It gets rid of the situation like in Dominion, where the number of action cards is such a highly controlled and highly game-deterministic mechanic of the cards that are face-up.

759
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:32,730
Scott: And the thing is, you know the game is good, because you always are just so frustrated that if only I could do the roll and then the action, I would be set, but you can't.

760
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:34,263
Rym: It's the Java situation.

761
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:38,030
Scott: You have to do the roll and let it go around the table, then do the action.

762
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:46,109
Rym: I mean, imagine if T&E, how many times do you think, "Oh my god, if only I could take three actions in Java, if only I had one more action

763
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:46,429
Rym: point.".

764
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:53,330
Rym: Those games, I imagine the way they balance them is they just have a bunch of Germans sit around, and they play the game with, say, 20 action points.

765
00:39:53,731 --> 00:40:01,950
Rym: Then they play again with 19, 18, 17, 16, and as soon as a fistfight breaks out, they stop putting the number down, and that's the game.

766
00:40:03,741 --> 00:40:04,750
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, it's really good.

767
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,270
Scott: So the other thing I like about the game is that you have to colonize these planets.

768
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,270
Scott: So you use one of the actions, what was it?

769
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,409
Scott: There's colonize?

770
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,344
Scott: No, what was the green one?

771
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,790
Rym: Oh, so you have to explore.

772
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,970
Scott: The exploring one gets you planets, but they're face-down in front of you.

773
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:21,449
Scott: So you get planets in front of you.

774
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:31,470
Scott: Then you want to flip the planets over to actually activate them, so that once they're activated, they can produce goods, they can give you bonuses like making your hand bigger, and they give you victory points once they're flipped over.

775
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,350
Scott: But, there's two different ways to flip them over.

776
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:41,030
Scott: You can flip them over with ships and attacking them with the military, or you can flip them over with colonization, which is basically diplomacy.

777
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,533
Rym: Now this is the huge thing.

778
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:50,430
Rym: Basically, the game has two completely independent currency streams, and all the planets cost different amounts for either one.

779
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:55,427
Scott: It's like if in Dominion, it was like, you can buy this for five golds or three potions.

780
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,745
Scott: And it's like, oh, well I can either do potions or I can do money, and I don't have to do both.

781
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:03,230
Scott: Doing both actually is kind of dumb.

782
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:23,910
Rym: My plan, and actually it was working pretty well, is I focused on colonizing, but instead of trashing, because that's a trash mechanic, instead of trashing my military cards, whenever I had them, I rode on people's coattails and built up a small reserve of ships to then, hopefully, snipe up a quick planet near the end of the game.

783
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,494
Scott: Yeah, it's actually tough, right?

784
00:41:25,514 --> 00:41:31,590
Scott: Because I'm sitting there thinking, well, I don't want to keep picking colonize and military, because then I'm helping everybody, right?

785
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,096
Scott: I just want to keep picking one that no one else is picking, so it only helps me.

786
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:41,930
Scott: So I'm like, I'll pick military, I'll go all the way with the ships, no one else will pick ships, and thus when I pick ships for me, it won't help anyone else.

787
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,591
Scott: So I did that.

788
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:46,819
Scott: But, it's like when other people pick colonize, I was dicked.

789
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:52,730
Scott: So it's like, well I kind of want to pick colonize sometimes, but I don't want to pick it a lot, because that helps other people.

790
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:59,261
Scott: So it's sort of like, you want to go, you want to apple and you want to orange, and you're not quite sure what the right balance is.

791
00:41:59,722 --> 00:42:01,284
Scott: So it's like, I did like 75% military, 25% colonizing.

792
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,393
Rym: Granted, it's telling.

793
00:42:05,413 --> 00:42:09,529
Scott: Because the colonizing just sort of came in for free when other people picked it, so I'm like, well...

794
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:20,810
Rym: It's funny, we were playing kind of mirror strategies, like we were on the opposite side of these kind of, opposite side of the coin mechanics, and Scott won, and I was basically, he beat me by like one point.

795
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:21,973
Scott: I beat you by two points.

796
00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:28,490
Rym: Well because you had that bullshit luck of the card, the exact card you needed, basically I was guaranteed to win.

797
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,596
Scott: The card that I bought, with my research.

798
00:42:31,737 --> 00:42:38,030
Rym: Unless Scott had one card that he had bought in the course of the game in his hand by the time it was his turn on the last round.

799
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,920
Rym: So I forced it, and then he had the card, so he won.

800
00:42:42,582 --> 00:42:44,708
Rym: But yeah, Scott was first place, I was second place.

801
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,230
Scott: That's right.

802
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,355
Rym: It was a good game, I want to play it again.

803
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,481
Scott: Yeah, it was very good.

804
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:49,149
Rym: I won Marrakesh though, so fuck you.

805
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:50,513
Scott: The random game?

806
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:51,636
Rym: It wasn't that random.

807
00:42:51,897 --> 00:42:56,930
Scott: This game, actually, this game has no randomness of the planet stack.

808
00:42:57,831 --> 00:43:01,780
Scott: And it has randomness of the draw of your deck.

809
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,762
Rym: Yes, your deck's draw.

810
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,527
Rym: But not your deck's odds.

811
00:43:04,968 --> 00:43:05,830
Scott: No, not at all.

812
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:14,510
Scott: So, very little randomness in this game, but if you like Race of the Galaxy, if you like Dominion, if you like Puerto Rico, if you like any deck building, or any of those sorts of games.

813
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,617
Rym: It's surprisingly great, especially considering it's at most $25.

814
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:18,358
Rym: It's $32.04 on Amazon.

815
00:43:18,378 --> 00:43:24,310
Rym: I just bought it on Amazon for $23.

816
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,901
Scott: Well, I see it on eminent domain for $32.04 on Amazon.

817
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:30,629
Rym: Interesting, maybe people were buying it, I don't know.

818
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:30,769
Scott: Maybe.

819
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:33,354
Scott: 7 Wonders is $35.58.

820
00:43:33,354 --> 00:43:34,697
Scott: That's a good price.

821
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,118
Scott: That is.

822
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,468
Rym: One interesting thing, we played it with 4, that felt right, it's 2-4 players.

823
00:43:42,031 --> 00:43:42,752
Scott: Oh.

824
00:43:42,772 --> 00:43:45,996
Rym: And everyone agrees it's best with 3 players.

825
00:43:46,397 --> 00:43:47,038
Scott: Interesting.

826
00:43:47,098 --> 00:43:53,487
Rym: Which, think about it, all the 3 player games that have the fundamental breakdown have either indirect dicking or direct dicking.

827
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:55,810
Rym: that allows the Apple Apple Orange.

828
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,076
Scott: I can actually see it being best with 3, right?

829
00:43:58,097 --> 00:44:01,708
Scott: Because you've got the military, you've got the colonizing, and you've got the producing.

830
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:12,650
Rym: You've also now got to choose between 2 different strats, like every time you take an action you have 2 players to look at, and most likely any action you do will benefit one or the other.

831
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:18,630
Scott: But there's 3 pretty much paths to victory points, so with 4 players, 2 people have to pick the same one.

832
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:24,290
Rym: Yep, and I had to share the same one with the experienced player who brought the game, who was sitting to my rights.

833
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:31,070
Scott: Right, so those 2 people are pretty much going to be sort of dragged down, or maybe they'll be dragged up by Appling with each other, it's a tough call.

834
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:31,430
Rym: No.

835
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:32,173
Scott: Right?

836
00:44:32,494 --> 00:44:32,675
Scott: No.

837
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:36,530
Scott: And then the other 2 people basically, right, so it's like, well, you know, with 3 players...

838
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,195
Rym: I was not dragged up by him, he bought things I needed.

839
00:44:39,455 --> 00:44:48,070
Scott: Yeah, with 3 players, everyone can pick their own path and see who does their path most efficiently, but 2 players is going to be a whole bunch of stuff that goes undone.

840
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:55,868
Rym: But I feel like this elegantly gets around the 3 player problem by having, it has like the positive counter example to digging.

841
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,560
Scott: You can't gang up on people because it has no digging.

842
00:44:58,701 --> 00:44:58,962
Scott: Yes.

843
00:44:59,123 --> 00:45:00,290
Scott: So 3 players is just fine.

844
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,206
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

845
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:14,220
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

846
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:19,660
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

847
00:45:19,901 --> 00:45:22,588
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not 1, but 4 different shows.

848
00:45:22,729 --> 00:45:26,780
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

850
00:45:32,108 --> 00:45:35,194
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

851
00:45:35,395 --> 00:45:38,260
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
