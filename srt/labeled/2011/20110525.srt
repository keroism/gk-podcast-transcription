00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,968
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 25th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:12,430
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,796
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:15,839
Rym: How'd you may know it?

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:16,280
Rym: Oh?

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,231
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:26,879
Rym: I don't know if I ever mentioned this on the show.

8
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:32,500
Rym: cuz I've been biking a lot But the best part of having a bike at work is that when it's lunchtime?

9
00:00:33,082 --> 00:00:35,373
Rym: I can get on that bike and go bike around.

10
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:40,760
Scott: I could do that also But that would mean going to elevator trips, which is not really worth it.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,077
Rym: I got an elevator no matter what cuz I'm if I go out you know every lunch.

12
00:00:44,097 --> 00:00:45,725
Rym: I go out I'm not staying in the office.

13
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:47,715
Scott: I mean elevator trips.

14
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,864
Scott: in the freight elevator We get away for the guy.

15
00:00:49,944 --> 00:01:04,111
Rym: I leave my bike outside because the Lincoln building one Grand Central Plaza is run by douchebags But it won't let me bring my bike in because I work too early for their tiny Hours and also they suck even if you do use the elevator takes forever.

16
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:04,995
Scott: Blame the union.

17
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:06,299
Scott: labor is not you know?

18
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:09,032
Rym: Yeah, no the building is run pretty badly in general.

19
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:12,444
Rym: I have a lot of complaints about it But that shit.

20
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:16,440
Rym: That's one of many, but yes of my bikes outside, but I biked over to Fleet week.

21
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,198
Rym: I don't know what what ship it was.

22
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:27,686
Rym: But as I got over to buy the intrepid this huge ship easily as big as the intrepid very similarly set up Was wait so is an aircraft carrier.

23
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:33,430
Rym: Ah I guess the intrepid isn't like a supercarrier like I know But it is an aircraft carrier.

24
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:34,316
Rym: Yeah, though.

25
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:42,340
Rym: It's funny Aircraft carriers are massive and yet the intrepid is actually fairly small compared to aircraft carriers that are bigger than it.

26
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,953
Rym: Well compared to modern aircraft carrier.

27
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:48,500
Rym: Yes, you know But we're getting the space shuttle so fuck all y'all.

28
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:55,426
Scott: I think I still say that you with the space shuttle in Queens where all the rockets are as opposed to on the intrepid word You know why.

29
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:57,839
Scott: the reason I'm putting on the trip is they can charge money for.

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,887
Rym: no There's more to it than that.

31
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,518
Rym: Do you know which one we're getting?

32
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:03,307
Rym: No, no, you really don't know.

33
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:06,539
Rym: we're getting the enterprise, okay, you know why we're getting the enterprise.

34
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:10,258
Rym: The intrepid went and picked it up after a test thing.

35
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,715
Rym: The intrepid has a history with that space shuttle.

36
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,966
Rym: Hey Yeah But the ship pulled in.

37
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:20,720
Rym: it was sideways like perpendicular to the back of the intrepid.

38
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,894
Rym: I guess the front the intrepid back.

39
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,766
Scott: I'm Side is the front mister.

40
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,992
Rym: You don't know if you show me a picture.

41
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:33,567
Rym: I think I could I guess pretty accurately Based on the engines and whatnot.

42
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:35,454
Rym: I guess I don't know if it's a screwdriver.

43
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,807
Rym: I don't know that much about ships I'm not even anything.

44
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:39,952
Rym: I know some.

45
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,720
Rym: I know a lot about Napoleonic era ships.

46
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:45,960
Scott: I know they float in the water and they have planes on them.

47
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,039
Rym: I know about the history of nuclear reactors on them and different kinds of drive mechanisms, but I know more about Horatio boats than about.

48
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:55,685
Rym: For some reason.

49
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:59,740
Rym: I know a lot about the armaments on the ships, but I don't know much about the ships themselves.

50
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:04,860
Scott: Thus is the way of you know, a kind of person who plays video games like Counter Strike.

51
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:06,367
Scott: Yep, you know a lot about.

52
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:20,550
Rym: I can tell you all about the FNP 90 Useless anyway, yeah But the ship was perpendicular it was being tugged in and I happened to arrive just as the entire ship screw was Presenting themselves along the rails and there's a big celebration.

53
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,556
Rym: So I watched that and then I biked back to work.

54
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:25,042
Scott: Hey Exciting.

55
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:31,429
Rym: Yeah, that was the most exciting part of my day until just now when we're doing GeekNights All right.

56
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:35,167
Scott: So let us uh Let us move along to some newses, right?

57
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:36,772
Rym: So that's Wednesday anime night.

58
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:38,938
Scott: There's actually some mild news here.

59
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,425
Rym: mild That's the best we got like.

60
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:44,433
Rym: hey, we got mild mild medium.

61
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:45,316
Scott: Maybe it's medium news.

62
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:46,579
Scott: It's definitely not hot.

63
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:47,823
Scott: So this?

64
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:51,033
Scott: this is a rumor, right but it seems to be.

65
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:54,358
Scott: there's a great deal of evidence for it So I'm gonna bring it out, right?

66
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:04,336
Scott: basically Someone was interviewing Takashi Mika a inner director of such films as Each of the killer and my number one movie.

67
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:13,088
Rym: Yeah Tons of awesome violent movies, by the way, if you have not seen each of the key we should do a show on each of the killer Didn't we do ultraviolet movies?

68
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:16,427
Rym: No, I think we could do a show just on each of the killer though I'd have to watch it again.

69
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:17,495
Scott: Well, I haven't you know.

70
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:23,892
Rym: anyway, yeah, if you've not seen each of the killer and You are okay with ultra violence.

71
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:29,156
Rym: I Want you all to watch it just so I can see your rage face at the ending.

72
00:04:29,256 --> 00:04:39,760
Scott: The thing is people people don't realize but you know Mika for all his Reputation of making a bunch of ultraviolet movies of which Mika was probably I mean each he was the most violent.

73
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:41,025
Scott: He actually is.

74
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:49,380
Rym: act is a pretty good film director period More of those semi-violent Yakuza movies we used to watch every day.

75
00:04:49,400 --> 00:05:07,292
Scott: but anyway He was being interviewed by someone at the Cannes Film Festival and he said that his next film he said out of his mouth his next film is a court drama based on a Nintendo DS video game and He said that his Little blood and it is a light comedy that he's filming now

76
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:07,774
Rym: Scott.

77
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:08,736
Rym: Let's let's see if we can.

78
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:10,040
Rym: we can narrow this down.

79
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,327
Rym: I mean, we're intelligent people, right?

80
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:13,499
Rym: So I mean, can you think of any?

81
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,413
Rym: DS games that are based on courtrooms.

82
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:18,859
Scott: There are pretty much two.

83
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:26,059
Scott: there's Yuzai x muzai, which is a Namco game and Phoenix Wright.

84
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,716
Rym: On top of that I'm so excited about the upcoming Phoenix Wright movie.

85
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:38,240
Scott: on top of that There was some photographs of what can only be a movie set for a Phoenix Wright game.

86
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:39,979
Scott: It could not possibly be anything else.

87
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:45,900
Scott: Well, I guess it could be Phoenix Wright land if there were an amusement park that was going to make a Phoenix Wright land.

88
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:49,040
Rym: So they every day they murder a random person.

89
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:56,960
Scott: There's photos that were put on the internet that were definitely not photoshopped that were clearly not can tell by the pixels.

90
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,225
Scott: Yes, I can tell by the pixels It was absolutely.

91
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:02,580
Scott: it could not be anything other than a Phoenix Wright movie set.

92
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,837
Scott: Therefore it is pretty much they're making this or at least they made a set.

93
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:14,460
Rym: now The big question really is going to be how much Mika like is he gonna do his kind of crazy stuff?

94
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:18,680
Scott: Well, I mean maybe during, you know when they're showing the people being horribly murdered.

95
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,193
Scott: I'm feeling it's gonna be incorrect.

96
00:06:23,314 --> 00:06:28,479
Scott: judging based on the look of that set I think it's gonna be pretty faithful adaptation to the game.

97
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,380
Rym: I concur on that front.

98
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:37,969
Rym: But I wonder if he'll pull some sort of crazy mind fuck as he seems to like to do like some clothes Already a crazy mind fuck.

99
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:38,913
Scott: It already has a twist.

100
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:40,280
Scott: That's the whole point of Phoenix, right?

101
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:40,802
Rym: You know him.

102
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:43,973
Rym: he'll twist it again like the movie will end with Phoenix.

103
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:45,037
Scott: He's not writing it.

104
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:45,780
Scott: He's just directing.

105
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,704
Rym: Yeah, he'll direct it.

106
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:53,028
Rym: He'll add a scene at the end where Phoenix wakes up and he's actually No, but naga.

107
00:06:53,048 --> 00:07:00,256
Scott: but anyway, this is totally awesome Like it's the kind of unexpected thing that is like, you know, it's a little nerd.

108
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:00,998
Scott: It's like nerd.

109
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:04,212
Rym: Ah, man It's a lot like when the Scott Pilgrim movie was announced.

110
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:05,800
Rym: people like oh they're making a Scott Pilgrim movie.

111
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:09,340
Rym: Man wouldn't be awesome if they oh they did get on a Monoguchi due to the music.

112
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:10,485
Scott: Well, he did.

113
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:11,971
Scott: they did the music for the video.

114
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:12,754
Rym: Oh, yeah the video game.

115
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:14,220
Rym: Oh, well, how's the view him gonna be?

116
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,776
Rym: Oh a bit styling 16-bit style.

117
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:25,812
Scott: Yeah It's one of those things where someone does right by the nerds and there is some sort of nerd Collision in the in the Adam Smasher.

118
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:27,140
Scott: That is the entertainment world.

119
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:31,299
Rym: My favorite occurrences of those are when it's the kind of thing that nerd would say Oh that would never happen.

120
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,626
Rym: but would it be awesome if it did?

121
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:38,109
Scott: because like you would never even think of it that it would happen because it's such a Combination of awesome things the nerds love.

122
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:45,357
Rym: if two years ago you came to me and you're like, hey What if Takashi Miike made a movie for Phoenix Wright?

123
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:46,040
Rym: I'd be like, huh?

124
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,900
Scott: That's a combination of two things that are really far apart from each other that we that we like both of right.

125
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,386
Scott: It's sort of crazy Scott.

126
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,220
Rym: What if Takashi Miike made an adaptation movie of sanctuary?

127
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:09,680
Scott: I'm just saying you know it's like you have two nerderies that are both your nerderies that are far apart and somehow they get together like What if there was a My Little Pony manga drawn by the guys do Death Note?

128
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,020
Scott: It's like oh my god.

129
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,463
Scott: It's like you.

130
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:18,540
Scott: just take two nerderies that are so far apart and separated From each other and you bring them all the way together.

131
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:29,943
Rym: imagine if you could have like a sampling like a thousand people in front of you and they represent a perfect cross-section of the modern industrialized worlds population Announcing.

132
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:36,215
Rym: any one of those combinations will have 1.5 dudes going And everyone else not even like.

133
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:37,118
Rym: I'm giving a shit.

134
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:44,155
Rym: Yeah So the in huge news the big Apple comic-con was big.

135
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:46,324
Scott: if you have the word big in it Yeah.

136
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:48,926
Rym: and apples Guess those are good.

137
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:49,629
Scott: I like them.

138
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:51,357
Rym: So we've talked about this before.

139
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:58,440
Rym: basically The big Apple comic-con is one of many attempts by wizard to not go out of business.

140
00:08:58,941 --> 00:09:00,827
Scott: Well, they already stopped their magazine right.

141
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:01,911
Scott: wizard magazines dead.

142
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:04,539
Rym: Yeah, so they're basically going head-to-head.

143
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:08,799
Rym: Well They're going head-to-head with Reed exposition actually read pop.

144
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:12,600
Rym: Yeah, because they split all that off and it's complicated business relationship.

145
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:19,555
Rym: They're going head-to-head with them in the same way that I could go head-to-head in the boxing ring with I don't know Mike Tyson.

146
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:22,221
Rym: I Mean.

147
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:28,931
Rym: technically I could say I'm challenging Mike Tyson to some boxing and when he refuses I can say that yeah I want to fight him, but he just won't.

148
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:30,100
Rym: clearly he's afraid of me.

149
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:33,331
Scott: Well, he would if there was money involved and then you would just be dead.

150
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:35,960
Rym: Yeah, I would one punch not even lunch.

151
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:38,800
Scott: He's like, well, you wouldn't see the punch, but there would be one of them.

152
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:41,880
Scott: It might take two weeks on there.

153
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,108
Scott: You would walk up to him and then you would be.

154
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:50,960
Rym: it might take two because he punched me and I'd be falling over Already dead, but he hit me again before I hit the ground.

155
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,878
Scott: You'd be surprised how fast you can fall.

156
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:56,128
Rym: You'd be surprised how fast he can punch.

157
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:58,920
Rym: you would probably crumple forwards maybe yeah.

158
00:10:01,364 --> 00:10:14,502
Rym: But yeah, the Big Apple comic-con was you know one of their attempts and I actually could not find any real press about it or attendance numbers or anything Like.

159
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:15,768
Rym: I wanted to know how it was.

160
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:18,300
Scott: It's just one of those rooms full of people selling shit.

161
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:23,860
Rym: I knew some of our like you go to noth were there Yeah, and they didn't have anything to say about it and no one had anything to say about it.

162
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,978
Rym: and I looked around online and I found one article for my Fox, New York.

163
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:37,800
Rym: and The reason I make this my news is because whenever there's something nerdy Mainstream news it's like why do they even bother reporting on it because they put forth articles like this.

164
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:44,060
Rym: I'll read for you the entire article Big Apple comic-con opens in New York City.

165
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:50,260
Rym: Wizard world Big Apple comic-con spring edition is in full swing at the Penn Plaza Pavilion.

166
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:55,520
Rym: The event is the largest and longest-running comic-con in New York.

167
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:58,868
Rym: That's longest-running Well, actually it's renamed.

168
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,956
Rym: So that's actually kind of not true either.

169
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:06,980
Rym: Yeah Thousands of fans of all ages got their chance to meet their favorite comic book creators.

170
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:13,948
Rym: Comic-con is North America's largest pop culture tour And the event runs through the weekends.

171
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,780
Rym: So it's not the largest pop culture tour.

172
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,279
Scott: It is if you count because they have so many conventions that there's no really no other tours.

173
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:24,160
Rym: Ah, but I mean, what does pop culture to remain?

174
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:31,125
Rym: I mean, what about a band that's traveling and doing like a thousand concerts over the course of a year, you know It's all definition.

175
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:39,139
Rym: Yeah, but the fact that this article consists of four paragraphs Each of us a PR article written by the comic-con that they just the.

176
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:39,983
Rym: no It's not.

177
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:40,708
Rym: this is that this is.

178
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:42,380
Rym: there's a separate kind of news article.

179
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:52,554
Rym: This isn't the PR article written by the comic-con This is the board reporter and his intern had to cover The event because it was an event and they knew it was happening.

180
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:53,880
Rym: So they sent a guy down.

181
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:04,820
Rym: They got like two minutes of video and this guy wrote four single-sentence paragraphs Claiming it was the largest and longest-running comic-con in New York, which is interesting because I did a little of my own research.

182
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,760
Rym: So the New York comic-con run by Reed is in the Jacob Javits Convention Center.

183
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:15,579
Rym: The big apple comic-con is in the Penn Plaza Pavilion the PPP.

184
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,269
Rym: Yeah, not to be confused with the PPP.

185
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:18,852
Scott: Mm-hmm.

186
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:23,988
Rym: It features over 50,000 square feet of convex of conference space.

187
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,232
Scott: So that's very small.

188
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:33,454
Rym: It's clearly much larger than the 675,000 square foot Jacob Javits Convention Center gets somehow a larger convention fit inside.

189
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:34,597
Rym: It must be a TARDIS.

190
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:45,779
Rym: Yeah Four-dimensional convention, I don't know I wanted to report on like the numbers or like something about the big apple comic-con But all I could find it's just a room full of comics.

191
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:50,240
Rym: There's nothing else to it, but I was looking for like a blog someone saying something.

192
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,799
Rym: Here's what I found someone stole 10 grand worth of Neil Adams original art.

193
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,960
Rym: Oh, it was on his table and I guess the earth expanded and it fell through a crack and disappeared.

194
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:08,040
Rym: And One of the guests of the con didn't show up because he was arrested in Connecticut for having child porn.

195
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:10,752
Rym: Yep, and possibly making child porn.

196
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:12,580
Scott: The thing is that guy's actually kind of a good artist.

197
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:16,289
Rym: Yeah, he does a countdown mystery something.

198
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:17,372
Rym: I see a picture of here.

199
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:23,491
Scott: Yeah, basically it was interesting because somebody in Over, you know on the Internet's was had a question right there.

200
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:28,796
Scott: Like look I have a piece of art by this guy Who turned out to be a pedophile later, right?

201
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,700
Scott: But it's on sort of a jam piece, right?

202
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:38,720
Scott: So a jam piece is when like you get a big piece of paper and you go around to different artists and you might say Hey you draw your favorite x-man.

203
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,415
Scott: Hey you draw your favorite x-man on the same piece of.

204
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:44,432
Scott: you know, you go to different artists You have each person draw a different x-man, right?

205
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:45,640
Scott: That's like a jam piece.

206
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:50,710
Scott: So imagine if you had this pedophile guy Draw something on the jam piece at before.

207
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,640
Scott: you knew he's a pedophile, right and he was still in pencil.

208
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:54,919
Scott: So you could still erase it.

209
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:59,679
Rym: Oh, so so if the debate is do you sell it for more money to face the work buyer?

210
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:01,046
Scott: Well, no No, it's a jam piece.

211
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:03,560
Scott: So this art by other artists on the same piece of paper.

212
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:06,338
Scott: So you're either erase it or keep it or sell it.

213
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:09,496
Scott: Well, no, you can't sell the whole piece because you want to finish it.

214
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:09,939
Scott: It's not done.

215
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:16,009
Rym: yet It's like maybe you want to but maybe you want to finish it and then sell it pointing out that yeah That pedophiles on there.

216
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,258
Scott: No, it's it's because you're.

217
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,605
Scott: yeah You're assuming that you're gonna keep it because it's this jam piece You've been having.

218
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,640
Scott: you've been getting worked on at convention after convention.

219
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:26,731
Rym: Because go back to John Wayne Gacy the clown serial killer.

220
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:40,905
Rym: Mm-hmm, and he started painting a lot especially in prison and all his paintings were auctioned and People debated like at one point maybe they should sell them and have the money go to like charities for victims of crime or whatever Mm-hmm.

221
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:48,975
Rym: So instead a Whole bunch of people got together bought up as many of the paintings as they could and then burn them.

222
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,079
Scott: Oh How much they pay though, I don't know who got that money I don't know.

223
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:55,547
Rym: Yeah, I would say I don't know.

224
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,237
Rym: if I were him I would erase it.

225
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:03,028
Rym: Yeah, if you were found guilty, but the evidence is looking pretty big in this news article I mean, it's pretty much.

226
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,160
Scott: I mean, you know, we don't know if he's guilty or not.

227
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,709
Scott: So I would definitely wait at least for that.

228
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:19,507
Scott: Yeah, but the evidence As was reported in my in my opinion the evidence as reported by the news if accurate is pretty damning Had a USB stick he gave to a funeral allegedly.

229
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:20,650
Scott: Yeah.

230
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,455
Rym: Well, he did have everything allegedly.

231
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:22,716
Scott: Yes.

232
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:23,217
Scott: Yeah.

233
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:26,126
Rym: Yeah USB stick Allegedly gave it to a funeral home.

234
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,353
Rym: funeral home allegedly found child porn on it.

235
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:30,680
Rym: a warrant was issued in his house.

236
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,299
Rym: They found much more child porn.

237
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:42,180
Scott: There is a reasonable doubt the child including the child porn could have put on been put on the USB stick By the funeral home and then the child porn in his house could have been put there by someone else.

238
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:46,070
Rym: But the child porn in his house allegedly includes one of his nieces.

239
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:50,991
Rym: I mean, I guess the funeral home could have kidnapped his niece.

240
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,115
Scott: Does he live with anyone?

241
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:53,320
Rym: I have no idea.

242
00:15:53,622 --> 00:15:55,320
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'm gonna link to this news article.

243
00:15:55,821 --> 00:16:02,039
Rym: The sad thing is this news article right on CBR which looks like a comic news place is basically like.

244
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:06,820
Rym: So far the mainstream news hasn't really picked up on the fact that this guy was a comic artist.

245
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,488
Rym: Kind of hope that doesn't happen.

246
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:10,780
Rym: We don't want to get bad publicity.

247
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:19,280
Scott: Yeah, I mean the thing is right, you know You were just complaining about how bad the the news article about the you know, the big apple comic-con is.

248
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:23,860
Rym: Well, this article is like one two, it's four paragraphs, but there are multiple sentences per paragraph.

249
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:27,513
Rym: It's actually there's almost journalism here almost.

250
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:32,820
Scott: but that's the thing is like, you know Anyone who has an area of expertise like maybe your science is notorious.

251
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:35,943
Rym: I could write a better article on the New York or the big Comic-con.

252
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:37,911
Rym: then these people did and I didn't even go to it.

253
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:40,180
Scott: What I'm saying is anyone's an area of expertise, right?

254
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,950
Scott: So if we read something in the New York Times about technology, right?

255
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:45,560
Scott: We see that it's an awful article almost all the time.

256
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:53,640
Scott: Yep, right and we read an article maybe not in our area of expertise Maybe something in the food or art section or you know, right and we don't really see anything wrong with it.

257
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:02,954
Scott: But the thing is I can guarantee you the people who are like professional chefs or artists or whatever They they look at that food art section article the same way we look at the technology section article.

258
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:07,529
Scott: every almost every article in Mainstream news is awful.

259
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,260
Scott: Well, it's just whatever your area of expertise is.

260
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:14,037
Scott: Your articles are awful, but you don't realize it about the other one.

261
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:26,400
Rym: at the same time There are degrees and my main point there is that if you look at this article While there's probably problems with it and problems with many articles is at least a number of words strung together with no grammatical errors.

262
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:30,273
Rym: That's true, which is more than I can say for many news articles.

263
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:33,089
Scott: I read well, I'm talking about mainstream media Right, like the main news.

264
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:37,680
Rym: Yeah, cuz right cuz the one you CNN that looked like they were written by kindergartners, right?

265
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,128
Scott: So that first article you mentioned was from Fox or something, right?

266
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:43,500
Scott: But Fox right but CBR that's a specialized thing.

267
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:50,260
Scott: So if you read news from a specialized source, they're probably gonna get it more right if it's in their area of expertise, right?

268
00:17:50,340 --> 00:18:02,440
Scott: So if you're reading a site that's only technology news The technology news is on that site might be less crappy than the ones from New York Times, which is generic newspaper You know, yep anyway.

269
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:10,357
Rym: So things of the day.

270
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:21,371
Rym: I was watching My Little Pony videos last night Just kind of because and it reminded me how much I like PMVs which reminded me how much I like AMVs.

271
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:22,194
Scott: these are good.

272
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:24,440
Rym: I'm actually a really big fan of anime music video.

273
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:24,961
Rym: good ones.

274
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:29,989
Rym: I don't go to convention contests anymore because That's a waste of time.

275
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,039
Rym: I think we've talked about it before but I'll sum it up.

276
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:47,698
Rym: even the biggest anime cons have Pretty shit anime music video contests because they often insist on showing bad ones and they have rules that often will exclude good videos from actually being showed or being competing because they'll say like oh if you Already won a con.

277
00:18:47,718 --> 00:18:49,530
Rym: You can't win our con as opposed.

278
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:58,344
Rym: I mean if I were like Otakon or anime Boston I would say you have to have already won another con within the past 365 days or we won't even show your video.

279
00:18:58,484 --> 00:18:59,650
Rym: Yeah, that's what I would do.

280
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,170
Rym: But anyway, I really like anime music videos.

281
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:07,390
Rym: So I thought this is a good opportunity to pick a random one but a newish one and it just so happens.

282
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:15,918
Rym: I ran afoul of this pretty funny AMV to Hajime No Ippo about Takamura Who is possibly my second or third favorite character?

283
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:22,817
Scott: Yeah, actually I was reading some of the mangas that pick up after where The show ends because I've watched every episode.

284
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:35,220
Scott: Yeah, and there was a I don't know if it was the first favorite character poll but it was a favorite character poll among the readers who actually read Shonen Jump for real and Takamura was number one of course kind of like mr.

285
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,270
Scott: Tokai exactly anyway, so I have for you.

286
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,401
Scott: I don't know if this is actually a valid thing of the day.

287
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:42,150
Scott: It's an anti thing of the day, right?

288
00:19:42,612 --> 00:19:44,464
Rym: So it's something bad exactly.

289
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:47,278
Rym: Oh You want to do like a reverse week?

290
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,062
Scott: I don't know.

291
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:48,966
Rym: we should do that.

292
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:49,870
Rym: We should do a four night.

293
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:51,810
Scott: This isn't is an anti thing of the day thing.

294
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,070
Scott: They supposed to be the best thing we found on the internet today or what recently since the last show.

295
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:57,990
Scott: But this is something bad real bad.

296
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:00,157
Rym: So I was gonna.

297
00:20:00,378 --> 00:20:01,626
Rym: I was gonna make a joke, but I stopped.

298
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:09,597
Scott: so This is basically a blog post right from May 5th, which I guess is 20 days or May 20 May 11.

299
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:13,399
Rym: I don't know What is it May 5th or May 11th?

300
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,310
Scott: This is I can't tell but whatever is that?

301
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,574
Rym: What kind of journalism is this?

302
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:20,750
Scott: because the way the date is formatted on this site is not easy to read.

303
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:23,010
Scott: It's like just it's like the numbers are just all around.

304
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,059
Rym: But how could you confuse May 5th and May 11th?

305
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,705
Scott: because it says five.

306
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:35,149
Scott: There's a big number five And then it says May slash 11, uh 5th of May 2011. it could be that's could possibly but you know.

307
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:37,719
Scott: Anyway, this guy's like.

308
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:40,309
Scott: let me read the opening paragraph of this blog post.

309
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:49,453
Scott: Folks, it is no secret that I like children even as a we let It is.

310
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:57,876
Rym: oftentimes I'll read something that is bad and I'm reading it's like ah, ah, ah, it is rare for that to happen In the first sentence,

311
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:06,999
Scott: all right, even as a we led back in the day I would more often than not favor the younger cast members in the anime I watched and this remains unchanged even till today.

312
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,646
Rym: However, I think Daryl Surrett tweeted this art.

313
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:10,107
Rym: He did.

314
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:11,210
Scott: That's why I found it.

315
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:11,463
Scott: Yeah.

316
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:16,765
Scott: However in this time and age my fondness for the little ones is misconstrued to be malicious in nature.

317
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:21,604
Scott: in order to dispel some of That prejudice I would like to take this opportunity to celebrate Children's Day.

318
00:21:21,785 --> 00:21:22,608
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

319
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:28,649
Scott: So, you know this guy is doing by listing five of my favorite children in Japanese cartoons.

320
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:30,993
Rym: I Saw that article.

321
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:35,067
Rym: Yeah, I'd scroll down to the pictures my favorite.

322
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:50,467
Scott: Wow I mean, you know you think from that opening paragraph right that he's basically like look I know you guys are probably gonna think I'm a pedophile like, you know, totally dude, bro situation imagine fashion You know, he's probably thinking oh everyone thinks I'm a pedophile.

323
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:51,010
Rym: It's like dude.

324
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:53,441
Rym: I'm bad because I'm dressing up babies.

325
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:54,446
Scott: Yeah, right.

326
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:55,230
Rym: I mean you're playing.

327
00:21:57,134 --> 00:22:00,282
Scott: What if I just happen to like younger care?

328
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:01,003
Scott: I have a preference.

329
00:22:01,063 --> 00:22:07,301
Scott: I like younger characters in anime which could be legitimate Right, it's sort of like, you know, look I'm not a pervert.

330
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:10,753
Scott: I just you know, I don't like them in that way I like them in just.

331
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:12,680
Scott: I you know, everyone has favorite characters.

332
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:21,230
Scott: some people like, you know, the badass giant character Everybody likes for example of Chio-chan from asa manga dial exactly, right?

333
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,330
Scott: So you just like it yotsuba, right?

334
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:29,696
Scott: You just like them the way, you know in a totally or not only because according to this guy She's technically 400 years old.

335
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:34,050
Scott: So it's okay a totally non malicious normal liking, right?

336
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,890
Rym: Yeah, pretty much sounds like he's straight-up saying like I want to have sex with little kid.

337
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,120
Scott: Well in the first paragraph, it sounds like he's not.

338
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:49,203
Scott: but then as soon as he actually lists the characters He posts really perverted panty shots and he's like, yeah I want to take them to town and he's like he's.

339
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:51,210
Scott: at least I got to give the guy credit.

340
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:53,379
Scott: He's not hiding that he's a pedophile.

341
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:53,962
Scott: He's like, yep.

342
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,829
Scott: I want to rape little girlies.

343
00:22:56,412 --> 00:23:00,386
Rym: Ah to his credit sounds like he doesn't want to forcibly.

344
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:07,350
Rym: It's not rape rape No, okay, and to at least he's taking his predilections out on two-dimensional characters that don't exist.

345
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:08,722
Scott: But the thing is right.

346
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:15,233
Scott: it's like, you know Typically what you have is you have like the love Hina situation where it's like, you know You you.

347
00:23:15,514 --> 00:23:18,080
Scott: it's perverted but it's not perverted right?

348
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:21,049
Scott: There's some sort of cover like, you know chew brah.

349
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:23,701
Scott: It's okay I'm learning about underwear love Hina.

350
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:25,530
Scott: It's a wacky comedy, right?

351
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,490
Scott: You know, there's some sort of cover for the pervertedness, but this guy doesn't even bother with cover.

352
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:32,280
Scott: He's just you know a sick fuck and it's like.

353
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:41,430
Scott: this is the perfect example of all that is wrong With these kinds of anime people and most of the new animes that are all moe perverted crap.

354
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:46,890
Rym: I would argue that they're similarly messed up people who just don't know anime exists, right?

355
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:51,344
Scott: But I'm just saying is that you know this kind of shit gives no normal people.

356
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,370
Scott: if they see this they think all anime.

357
00:23:53,552 --> 00:23:55,130
Rym: Is this got by the same token?

358
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,978
Rym: I mean most people think that all IT people are fat.

359
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,169
Rym: Unix Santa's and all computer science guys are like Jonathan Colton.

360
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:07,909
Scott: They aren't Yeah Yeah, yeah, okay my point exactly.

361
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:12,822
Rym: Well, it's funny cuz I'm not really an IT guy like I'm an engineer.

362
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:18,313
Rym: it's kind of all the IT guys I know tend to do more IT Stereotypical stuff.

363
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:27,389
Scott: This is this is horrible, but you have to see it just so you can like, you know It's like you got to see what what's the worst that you have a good perspective on the world?

364
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,409
Scott: Wow of disgusting horrible people.

365
00:24:31,634 --> 00:24:38,850
Rym: All right in the meta moment We will be at PAX Prime and PAX dev probably and all that stuff in the far future.

366
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,361
Rym: The book club book is Isaac Asimov's foundation.

367
00:24:41,843 --> 00:24:43,289
Rym: You should be in the forum because it's rockin.

368
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:45,334
Scott: Let's keep it short.

369
00:24:45,555 --> 00:24:46,057
Rym: Keep it short.

370
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:46,418
Rym: Nothing else.

371
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:47,724
Scott: recess is coming up pretty soon.

372
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:48,869
Rym: Yeah, you know all that stuff.

373
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,017
Rym: Anime, we watched an anime.

374
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:53,322
Scott: We did watch an anime.

375
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:54,345
Rym: Scott watched all of it.

376
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,650
Rym: I watched five episodes.

377
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:58,569
Rym: Yeah, so apparently Scott has nothing else to do.

378
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,513
Scott: I got plenty to do.

379
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:00,857
Scott: You know how much I got done?

380
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:01,198
Scott: Lots.

381
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,890
Scott: Anyway, so Hajime no Ippo is a shounen fighting.

382
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:09,430
Scott: Manga slash anime about boxing the sport of boxing.

383
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:10,097
Scott: So I guess it's not.

384
00:25:10,137 --> 00:25:17,969
Scott: shounen fighting is shown in sports But it it's the same formula as initial D or as Dragon Ball or as any of those shounen Naruto or hakara.

385
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:24,803
Scott: no go It's the same formula, you know And it's about boxing and it's been going for an incredibly long time.

386
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:29,479
Scott: There's like hundreds and hundreds of chapters The manga is still going.

387
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:36,467
Scott: as far as I can tell the anime Consists of a 75 episode TV series from about you know, it was basically.

388
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:45,990
Scott: it came out you know in the about a decade ago, then there's a Like a one episode TV special that is sort of like champion road.

389
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:46,753
Scott: It's like it.

390
00:25:46,773 --> 00:25:47,376
Scott: basically it's an.

391
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:47,577
Scott: it's.

392
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:50,510
Scott: it's a long episode that follows up the 75 episode series.

393
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:55,225
Scott: Then there's an OAV single episode and then there is a newer series.

394
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:55,707
Scott: That is 26 episodes.

395
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:58,476
Scott: That came out just a few years ago.

396
00:25:58,497 --> 00:26:08,795
Scott: that just pretty much picks up right where the other stuff left off you know and the anime as far as I can tell is almost a Direct translation of the manga.

397
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:17,139
Scott: like I read a couple manga chapters that overlapped with the anime that I saw which is all the anime And it was effectively identically the same.

398
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,453
Scott: like the manga is storyboards for the anime 99%.

399
00:26:21,453 --> 00:26:23,850
Scott: Now, why do we care about Hajime no Ippo at all?

400
00:26:24,912 --> 00:26:26,076
Scott: Another shown in fighting things.

401
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:27,060
Rym: Well on one end.

402
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:28,365
Rym: I mean forget our tastes.

403
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:29,510
Rym: just look at popularity.

404
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,179
Rym: It's just one of those kind of always there.

405
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:35,710
Rym: a lot of people watch it generally just really really popular.

406
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:37,950
Scott: Well, the thing is it's not really really popular, right?

407
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:46,129
Scott: It's really really popular among the sort of you know The anime people who care enough about anime and are hardcore and want to watch the.

408
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:47,997
Scott: you know The series good animes.

409
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:50,770
Scott: those people seem to like Hajime and talk about it a lot.

410
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:54,230
Scott: Among the general anime fandom in America.

411
00:26:56,773 --> 00:27:02,002
Rym: Most people have never heard of it never heard of it and don't care I mean, I didn't know much about it until relatively recently.

412
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:03,990
Scott: I knew that it was an anime about boxing.

413
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:06,847
Rym: It just wasn't on my radar cuz I was watching other stuff.

414
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:10,224
Scott: Yeah I mean it was on the list, you know, cuz people kept talking about it.

415
00:27:10,606 --> 00:27:11,410
Scott: I didn't watch it at all.

416
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:15,723
Scott: But anyway, so why do we care about this shonen fighting?

417
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:17,690
Scott: Just you know, just another formulaic show.

418
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:28,197
Scott: Well, the thing is while it is entirely 100% formulaic it is an incredible I don't want to say the best but an incredible Execution of that formula.

419
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:28,519
Scott: right.

420
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,042
Scott: there are plenty of shows that follow this formula Poorly, well even even shows I like like initial D.

421
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:39,070
Rym: I will say I like initial D Initially is kind of stupid and it has has a lot of problems.

422
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:42,904
Rym: It does not pull off the formula as well as Hajime no Ippo does.

423
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:47,364
Rym: the only reason initial D Eeks past it my personal like is because of the music.

424
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:54,470
Scott: I happen to like that music a lot Yeah, but like something like rave master or my god Naruto anime or bleach, right?

425
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,684
Scott: Those actually execute the formula poor very poorly compared to Hajime.

426
00:27:58,724 --> 00:27:59,306
Scott: no info right?

427
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:04,006
Scott: They drag out the fights Forget the Final Fantasy anime.

428
00:28:04,227 --> 00:28:08,910
Scott: Yeah, right There's plenty of you know shows in the same exact genre that are just bad.

429
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:13,620
Scott: They don't you know, even though they're the same show they on the sir on this, you know the foundation.

430
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:16,522
Scott: They just the animations not good.

431
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:21,787
Rym: The character designs aren't as good And Naruto are well animated and have good characters.

432
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:25,845
Scott: Yes The humor isn't as good, you know this stuff about it.

433
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:33,087
Scott: This is not as good Even though the story is the same thing only to replace boxing with ninja fights or whatever else.

434
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:37,050
Scott: you want to replace it with The other thing about her car Hajime no Ippo.

435
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:44,950
Scott: Alright as I learned this that The show the anime didn't start until after there was already a whole bunch of manga, right?

436
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,194
Scott: So something like Naruto.

437
00:28:46,314 --> 00:28:49,204
Scott: actually the anime gets ahead of the manga or catches up to it.

438
00:28:49,284 --> 00:28:50,127
Rym: and then what happens?

439
00:28:50,408 --> 00:28:53,250
Scott: they filler episodes filler episodes and tournaments.

440
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:59,842
Scott: Right guys, y'all got to come back home to do the tournament Whereas Ippo is still even today far behind the manga.

441
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:07,024
Scott: if you watch all of the anime as I have You can go to ish a manga chapter number 400 and you're exactly.

442
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:08,448
Scott: but there's like way more than 400 chapters.

443
00:29:09,532 --> 00:29:10,717
Scott: Wait hundreds more right?

444
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:17,830
Scott: so they still if they're gonna animate it They have tons of material to work with and they can get the pacing exactly, right?

445
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,590
Scott: They can make the fights last the correct number of episodes.

446
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,730
Scott: They don't have to drag them out for 10 episodes while they wait for another month.

447
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,890
Rym: Oh, that is what I really like about the show.

448
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,338
Rym: It is one thing initial D did well too.

449
00:29:27,378 --> 00:29:29,570
Rym: is that the the formula like the fights?

450
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:36,051
Rym: Keep me engaged the whole time and there they they don't just kind of go back and forth like a lot of crappy shown in Fighting.

451
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:38,921
Rym: shows will kind of go back and forth with nothing happening.

452
00:29:39,383 --> 00:29:41,250
Rym: everything that happens in the fight matters.

453
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:45,510
Scott: Yep, right then and there and it's all and most of it is just building suspense, right?

454
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:56,110
Scott: And the only really negative thing I can say about the fights is that at least you know Is that the fights have sort of this every single fight is the ultimate battle, right?

455
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:00,350
Scott: At least every fight that matters almost every fight that matters is like so epic.

456
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,970
Scott: They both go down ten times to the final round, you know.

457
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:10,510
Scott: Whereas in real boxing a lot of fights are uneventful because they're sort of one-sided ish like all those Mike Tyson fights.

458
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:15,610
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, you see people these boxing records of like, you know, 62 KOs or something.

459
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,750
Scott: Well, that's because he fought a whole bunch of chumps that he knocked out in the first round.

460
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:26,154
Scott: Right and you don't you know All the fights that are important to the plot of Hajime no Ippo are always epic fights Everything's like that.

461
00:30:26,174 --> 00:30:30,590
Rym: I mean what sanctuary have been nearly as interesting if it kept showing him just taking a poop.

462
00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:33,730
Scott: No, but I mean a couple times the fights got to be lame, right?

463
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,788
Rym: So like he goes to fight with the senator in America and the guy just as push over.

464
00:30:37,828 --> 00:30:42,403
Scott: Yeah I think there was one non epic fight in Hajime in a bow.

465
00:30:42,664 --> 00:30:43,868
Rym: Oh, yeah, he fights that bear.

466
00:30:43,928 --> 00:30:44,530
Rym: I mean, whatever.

467
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,878
Scott: Yeah The other thing is this show right.

468
00:30:49,918 --> 00:31:01,299
Scott: the first the 75 episode first series at least right was made by Madhouse And they made it pretty much right after they made Trigun and it was directed by the same guy directed Trigun Yeah And it seems like it was pretty much the same people.

469
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:12,017
Scott: and you can tell like the music is similar Like it has to be made by the exact same people and it was actually the last hand animated like cell Painted show done by Madhouse.

470
00:31:12,097 --> 00:31:13,823
Rym: after that's a very nice piece of trivia.

471
00:31:13,843 --> 00:31:14,706
Rym: You can lay on people.

472
00:31:14,726 --> 00:31:15,950
Scott: Yeah after that they went digital.

473
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:23,223
Scott: So it's like, you know all of the animation Qualities and musical qualities and production qualities of Trigun are there.

474
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:25,550
Scott: and Hajime no Ippo only better, right?

475
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:33,656
Scott: So for that aspect, you know, it's got a whole bunch of a pluses in its execution doesn't have the same Pacifism vibe.

476
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:36,067
Scott: No, it's usually about punching someone's face.

477
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:45,150
Scott: Yep and you know the show is done while it there is a lot of Realistic boxing knowledge because that's how these shows work, right?

478
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:46,837
Scott: Go teaches you about go.

479
00:31:46,857 --> 00:31:51,033
Rym: even initial D teaches like some things about Your car.

480
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:53,622
Rym: no go also has ghosts telling you what move to make.

481
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:58,124
Rym: Why do you think you always lose it go?

482
00:31:58,144 --> 00:31:58,969
Rym: Yeah, how'd you go?

483
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,071
Scott: How'd?

484
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:15,590
Scott: you may know Ippo has a lot of real boxing stuff, but it also has lots of basically superhero nonsense Like, you know, everyone has special attacks and people take some unreason Everyone takes some unreasonable out amount of damage like they would have been severely brain damaged by now.

485
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,956
Rym: Oh, these characters are all gonna have There's a you know punch drunk.

486
00:32:19,977 --> 00:32:21,061
Rym: love the movie.

487
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:22,950
Rym: Yeah punch drunk is a term.

488
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,136
Rym: There's a medical term for now.

489
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:26,910
Rym: that basically is the dementia that happens if you're a boxer.

490
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,512
Scott: Yeah, they.

491
00:32:27,632 --> 00:32:34,039
Scott: they do refer to punch drunkenness and it does take place in the plot and you know There are.

492
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:35,390
Scott: they are like you got to throw in the towel.

493
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,857
Scott: He's gonna be permanently damaged.

494
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:40,738
Scott: and you know, there's a lot of they talk about it In they're already permanently damaged.

495
00:32:42,731 --> 00:32:44,430
Scott: Yeah, it's not completely ignored.

496
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:58,293
Scott: But the thing is the amount of damage they portray versus the amount of damage it would take to incur permanent injury is Not matching right, you know, it's like they're like, oh no if he takes any more hits He'll be.

497
00:32:58,413 --> 00:33:01,062
Scott: you know, he might get brain damage and it's like.

498
00:33:01,222 --> 00:33:18,269
Scott: actually he's probably already been brain damage apparently based on that number and level of hits and You know, so if you're looking for ultra realistic boxing you're not gonna get it But it you will learn about boxing and just like you watch any Shonen thing if you get into it You'll suddenly care about whatever it's about.

499
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,402
Scott: Like if you watch a car now go you start wanting to play.

500
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:23,138
Scott: go if you watch an initial D You start wanting to drive cars.

501
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:25,030
Scott: if you watch how'd you man Apple?

502
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,484
Scott: You start thinking that you could be a boxer and then you say wait a minute.

503
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:32,589
Scott: I don't want brain damage And I'm way too old to start boxing now way too late.

504
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:38,091
Scott: You got to start that shit when you're like 18.

505
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:40,564
Rym: Anyway, yeah, I mean Scott's seen all of it.

506
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,590
Rym: We're not gonna spoil anything.

507
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:44,030
Rym: This is a review to get you to watch it.

508
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:57,492
Rym: But what I mean one thing I really enjoy about the show and a lot of the kind of shown any fighting shows I do like have this is that the characters are kind of goony and they're all friends with each other and they rip on each other and fight with each other and just a kind Of funny.

509
00:33:57,874 --> 00:34:00,706
Scott: Yeah, the cast of characters is is pretty good, right?

510
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:08,989
Scott: You've got you know You got like the mom and you know Some other side characters and it starts out in school, but eventually gets away from schools.

511
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:19,710
Scott: But some of the school characters stick around But most of the main characters are all the people in the gym Right the coach and you know these three other boxers that are in the same gym as Ippo the main character.

512
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:23,085
Scott: I guess we should summarize the plot at least a little bit.

513
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:24,090
Rym: Oh becomes a boxer.

514
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:30,150
Scott: This yeah, Ippo is a kid who gets picked on And his mom runs a fishing boat.

515
00:34:30,452 --> 00:34:31,216
Scott: So he doesn't really.

516
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:33,469
Scott: he's always working to help his mom with the fishing boat.

517
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,648
Scott: his dad is dead we had to assume right.

518
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:39,940
Scott: and So because of that he doesn't hang out with people really.

519
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:41,226
Scott: after school he gets picked on.

520
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:45,646
Scott: one day He's getting picked on under a bridge and some guy comes to save him.

521
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:45,786
Scott: Who is?

522
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,813
Scott: Takamura?

523
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,036
Scott: the the the king of perverts.

524
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:51,944
Scott: It was also an amazing box.

525
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:52,607
Rym: It's pretty great.

526
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:53,510
Rym: I love the scene.

527
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,264
Scott: I think he's like the funniest character.

528
00:34:55,284 --> 00:35:01,150
Rym: they get him into that They're like, alright, you're gonna train at our gym and the two goons like I we're gonna we're gonna train you.

529
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:03,219
Rym: Takamura is like nah, I'm gonna train him.

530
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,450
Rym: then the old guys like screw you all I'm gonna train him.

531
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:09,930
Scott: Yeah, Takamura is basically the second most important boxer in the show after Ippo, right?

532
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,950
Scott: It's like if they're not so sometimes they're focused the most of the time they're focusing on Ippo's plot.

533
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:17,351
Scott: But Takamura's plot is like the second plot, you know It's like.

534
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:17,853
Scott: you know.

535
00:35:17,873 --> 00:35:23,754
Scott: when Ippo's taking a rest after taking a beating your Takamura is fighting someone for a championship or something like that You know.

536
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:36,826
Scott: But yeah, so Takamura saves him from some bullies and then Ippo starts boxing and then he likes it and then he Advances and levels up and fights like shows that we like.

537
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:42,370
Rym: it breaks One of the tropes of these kinds of shows and that he's the main character and he is special.

538
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,649
Rym: He has a lot of raw talent.

539
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:44,891
Scott: Yeah his raw talent You know.

540
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:53,510
Scott: in initial D the raw talent comes from his dad tricked him by giving him a fast car and making him Deliver the tofu every day, but that was all in the past.

541
00:35:53,851 --> 00:36:03,684
Rym: So when the show starts he is already like in the top 1% of drivers in the world Like he's already invincible and your car no go he gets his power from the ghost.

542
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,670
Scott: right what other shonen things are there.

543
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:11,499
Rym: But in this show, he basically He's you know, it's like, uh, what was that movie?

544
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,890
Rym: God the kid who can throw the baseball really fast?

545
00:36:15,514 --> 00:36:21,784
Scott: Oh the one really the year we get Rookie of the year, I think I don't know what it was called.

546
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:22,870
Rym: I think I saw in the theater.

547
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:25,229
Scott: I might have yeah, but anyway, yeah.

548
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:28,770
Scott: So that's sort of like a lot of things a lot of other shonen properties.

549
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:34,290
Scott: Someone gets their powers of being awesome because of course the main character is like the greatest, right?

550
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:38,182
Scott: They get it by Fiat or by supernatural events like Naruto.

551
00:36:38,202 --> 00:36:40,109
Scott: just has this fox spirit in him or whatever, right?

552
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,403
Scott: But in Hajime no Ippo, he has some natural talent.

553
00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:44,990
Scott: because he worked on the fishing boat.

554
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:49,030
Scott: He was always carrying lots of heavy things to build up his strength, right?

555
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,542
Scott: we're just sort of a side effect of carrying heavy things.

556
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:56,558
Scott: he became strong and And Because he was always on a fishing boat.

557
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,970
Scott: He has excellent legs for balance, right?

558
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:07,275
Scott: So that's his natural talent, but that alone doesn't help you box and he actually builds up his boxing skills by Intense training.

559
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,723
Rym: Well, his first fight is great.

560
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:17,940
Rym: He's basically just like Defending and doing nothing else just sitting there like, uh, uh, get ya in his first fight ever which isn't a real fight It's just basically sparring.

561
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,474
Scott: the first time he went to the gym He's basically like.

562
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:24,570
Scott: my goal is to make it to the end of the thing, right?

563
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,470
Scott: You know, my goal is to not get knocked out and just to survive to the end of this fight.

564
00:37:28,931 --> 00:37:34,530
Scott: So it's sort of like hey, you know, they're not starting out with like some ridiculous thing where he knocks out some champion.

565
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,395
Scott: You know in the first go.

566
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:38,482
Scott: it's sort of like look you've never boxed before.

567
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:49,790
Scott: if you tried you would just get just killed Like if you walked into the ring, so and fight number one You just dodge and defend yourself and turtle up right and that's what he does.

568
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,573
Scott: You know, it's it's.

569
00:37:50,714 --> 00:37:54,490
Scott: and it's kind of cool that you actually see him even later in the show.

570
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,299
Scott: He's always working hard and every time he has a new fight.

571
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,630
Scott: They follow that same formula of here's the next opponent.

572
00:38:00,971 --> 00:38:03,260
Scott: Oh my god, the next opponent is so dangerous.

573
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,946
Scott: There's no way the main character can win.

574
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:05,548
Scott: Oh my god.

575
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:06,010
Scott: It's key.

576
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:06,878
Rym: What's wrong with you?

577
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,230
Rym: He'll always win, right?

578
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,370
Scott: There's no way you can win.

579
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:16,850
Scott: The next guy is so dangerous or sometimes it's like maybe you can win But there's always this threat where you're not certain whether he can win or not.

580
00:38:16,936 --> 00:38:17,090
Scott: right?

581
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,384
Scott: the opponent is almost always threatening.

582
00:38:19,404 --> 00:38:24,650
Scott: has some Thing about the opponent that makes you not sure if the main character will win or not?

583
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:28,797
Scott: Right, like you wouldn't bet your life on it And then they'd be main character.

584
00:38:28,877 --> 00:38:32,950
Scott: all info always trains a whole fuck ton right between every fight.

585
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:44,928
Scott: They actually show you him training and what kind of training he's doing and then in the fight They show you how that particular training that he was doing comes out to help him win and he wins like

586
00:38:46,252 --> 00:38:50,950
Rym: Pretty good and all the like training and everything like that maintains a high quality pretty much all the time.

587
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:51,773
Scott: Yeah, there it's a first.

588
00:38:51,793 --> 00:38:52,536
Rym: I mean try gun.

589
00:38:52,657 --> 00:38:53,038
Rym: Actually.

590
00:38:53,058 --> 00:38:53,882
Rym: I like the show.

591
00:38:53,902 --> 00:38:55,890
Rym: it goes way off model.

592
00:38:56,322 --> 00:38:57,194
Rym: Yeah a lot.

593
00:38:57,476 --> 00:38:58,685
Scott: and the thing is why.

594
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:06,568
Scott: well the thing is Hajime and it was easy to stay on model because I think the character designs make it easy and because the the manga storyboards Make it easy, right?

595
00:39:07,451 --> 00:39:08,115
Scott: Where's try gun?

596
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:10,570
Scott: do I can use the try gun manga for shit, right?

597
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,013
Scott: It doesn't help you with anything.

598
00:39:14,076 --> 00:39:16,864
Scott: I think that's also why they change all the does the try gun designs.

599
00:39:17,706 --> 00:39:18,207
Scott: I got hiccups.

600
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:27,839
Scott: Oh great Yeah, the thing is right is they show you how the training comes out to help him And in doing so right?

601
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:30,550
Scott: Oh, no, we were talking about the animation super hiccups, right?

602
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:32,905
Rym: So what the hiccup hit your brain?

603
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:33,409
Scott: Yeah, it did.

604
00:39:33,711 --> 00:39:46,530
Scott: I got punched in the head too many times because I was I was I was pretending to be Anyway, so the thing is you would think for a hand-drawn show there'd be lots of reused animation lots of stock footage, right?

605
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,141
Scott: But really in all those anime episodes, there are only one.

606
00:39:49,161 --> 00:40:00,750
Scott: I can only remember one or two Maybe one only Recap episodes right and even then there isn't a lot of reused footage, right?

607
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:06,230
Scott: It's like even though he's training again, it's like there's some things that are very quick like a two-second clip.

608
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:12,189
Scott: You might see them use a whole bunch of times but for the most part it's different training and different animation every time.

609
00:40:12,872 --> 00:40:18,670
Scott: Of course over the course of what's now a total of a hundred something episodes, but 75 of them were hand-done, right?

610
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,110
Scott: So even of course 75 episodes is very little reused stock footage, you know.

611
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:31,728
Scott: And you know They might not animate though every fight punch for punch the way they do say in cowboy bebop And they'll show you a lot of you know.

612
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:46,961
Scott: And there's a flurry of blows and it's just sort of a loop of two guys going pump it above it above it above it I. but you know They animate all the important parts of the fight the parts that matter to the to the plot to the story of you know Is trading into the story of how he's actually gonna win.

613
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:49,510
Scott: and you know, every fight is up and down and up and down.

614
00:40:49,610 --> 00:41:08,370
Scott: So it's you know, you got animations guys, you know passing out falling down Getting up right and the one trick that the manga and the anime both use to extensively especially during the fights is Sort of putting the camera in the worst place when something dramatic happens, right?

615
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:23,498
Scott: So it's like you'll see some guy from the back obscuring the other boxer and it'll look like they got dude just got uppercutted and it's like oh he's going down right and then There'll be a pause a suspenseful pause.

616
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:31,020
Scott: maybe the crowd will scream or something like that or someone will yell something and Then after this is with the exact correct timing.

617
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:32,785
Scott: They'll show you the other angle.

618
00:41:32,805 --> 00:41:33,989
Rym: It's like oh my god, he blocked it.

619
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,424
Rym: Classic two guys guns pointed at each other.

620
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:42,362
Rym: You hear a gun go off They stand there the winds blowing and then one of them falls over.

621
00:41:42,462 --> 00:41:44,247
Scott: Yeah, the show does it like 10,000 times?

622
00:41:44,308 --> 00:41:46,858
Scott: Yes for episode I mean it works every time.

623
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,554
Rym: I think Scott liked the show a lot since he watched all of it Almost immediately.

624
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:52,557
Rym: Yeah, I like it.

625
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:55,830
Rym: Okay, I'm gonna finish it in the next month or so like just watching it.

626
00:41:56,071 --> 00:42:00,150
Scott: Well, I mean it sort of drags you in because the pacing of it is the correct pacing.

627
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,572
Scott: It's not.

628
00:42:00,672 --> 00:42:02,178
Scott: it's sort of like the same pacing as Hokuto.

629
00:42:02,198 --> 00:42:06,014
Scott: no Ken right where the fights don't last a long time It keeps moving.

630
00:42:06,054 --> 00:42:06,978
Scott: It keeps progressing.

631
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:09,850
Scott: things that actually matter to the plot are constantly happening.

632
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,699
Scott: It doesn't drag out with a 10 episode fight.

633
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:17,173
Scott: It doesn't have an island episode where a bunch of stuff happens Meaningless you don't care about.

634
00:42:17,294 --> 00:42:30,350
Scott: every single episode moves things forward and a lot of times they'll do something like they'll end a fight Halfway through an episode and then they'll begin the threat of the next fight in the second half of the episode.

635
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,484
Scott: So now there was no unless you stopped watching in the middle of the episode.

636
00:42:33,524 --> 00:42:34,750
Scott: It wasn't a breaking off point.

637
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,177
Scott: It's always a keep watching the next episode.

638
00:42:37,237 --> 00:42:38,501
Scott: point, you know, there's.

639
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:40,226
Scott: no it's not like really a cliffhanger.

640
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,370
Scott: so much, you know.

641
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:42,904
Scott: But it's it's the.

642
00:42:43,045 --> 00:42:43,247
Scott: there's.

643
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:43,489
Scott: no.

644
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:48,969
Scott: If you stop at the end of an episode you want to see what happens next all the time if you care, right?

645
00:42:50,531 --> 00:42:57,048
Rym: I mean, it's a solid show and if you're an anime fan You should watch like four or five episodes of this show just to see if you like it.

646
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:04,677
Rym: Yeah And if you don't like it and you're new to anime watch a ton of other stuff and after you've seen a whole bunch of Anime come back to a show like this.

647
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:05,842
Rym: watch it again.

648
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:06,425
Rym: Make sure.

649
00:43:06,445 --> 00:43:07,630
Scott: well, I think the thing is right.

650
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:11,572
Scott: This show is obviously not for everybody right this, you know There's very.

651
00:43:11,593 --> 00:43:13,379
Scott: there's a certain kind of person who's gonna.

652
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:16,530
Rym: I mean if boxers killed your mom while you watched when you were a baby.

653
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,796
Rym: Yeah, it might not want to watch.

654
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:20,870
Scott: Yeah, I mean this, you know, this show will be boring to many people.

655
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:32,510
Scott: But the thing is if you are going to watch a shounen show a formulaic shounen show You should watch this one before you watch the other ones except maybe fist of the North Star, right?

656
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:38,250
Scott: It's pretty much this and fist of the North Star and and if you're like us initial D But most people not initially, right?

657
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:43,989
Scott: But if you're gonna watch shounen fighting shows or shounen sport shows that follow the formula make a hook don't?

658
00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:44,270
Scott: okay?

659
00:43:44,531 --> 00:43:48,410
Scott: And how'd you mean a bow that the top two in terms of well doneness?
