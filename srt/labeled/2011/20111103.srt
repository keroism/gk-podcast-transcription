1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,120
Rym: Well, it's that time again for "The Ear, The Eye, The Arm" by Nancy Farmer.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,377
Scott: Well, it's not time again for "The Ear, The Eye, The

3
00:00:06,398 --> 00:00:06,499
Scott: Arm.".

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,529
Rym: Oh, you didn't let me finish.

5
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:10,057
Rym: On "The GeekNights Book

6
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:10,579
Rym: Club.".

7
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,039
Scott: No, it's time again for "The GeekNights Book Club" this month.

8
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,230
Scott: "The Ear, The Eye, The

9
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:14,516
Scott: Arm.".

10
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:14,830
Scott: No.

11
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,400
Rym: Regardless, we read "The Ear, The Eye, The Arm," which was recommended to me by Emily.

12
00:00:18,883 --> 00:00:20,259
Scott: As a... I just can't help saying that.

13
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,233
Rym: "The Ear, The Eye, The

14
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:21,537
Rym: Arm.".

15
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:21,803
Scott: "The

16
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:21,927
Scott: Leg.".

17
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:22,814
Scott: "The

18
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:23,019
Scott: Arm.".

19
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:23,190
Scott: "The

20
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:23,340
Scott: Foot.".

21
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:23,422
Scott: "The

22
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:23,607
Scott: Foot.".

23
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:24,305
Scott: "The

24
00:00:24,346 --> 00:00:24,509
Scott: Dick.".

25
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:25,677
Scott: Can't help it.

26
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:32,460
Rym: You know, I was gonna say something other than dick, but I'm glad you went straight for dicks.

27
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,163
Scott: "The

28
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:33,390
Scott: Spleen.".

29
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,080
Rym: Dicks everywhere.

30
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:35,606
Rym: "The

31
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:35,796
Rym: Spleen.".

32
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:47,160
Rym: So, this was recommended by Emily, and the selling point, what sold me on reading it, was that it was short, kind of a young adult novel, and I didn't know the author, and it's sci-fi set in Africa.

33
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,400
Scott: Yeah, you would like the short books, 'cause you don't like doing hard work.

34
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,333
Rym: Alright, my next book's gonna be "The Count of Fucking

35
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:52,816
Rym: Motherfuckersto.".

36
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:54,035
Scott: I won't read it.

37
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:55,860
Rym: Actually, it's an awesome book.

38
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Scott: I'll get the abridged edition.

39
00:00:57,564 --> 00:01:00,000
Scott: It probably is awesome, but I'll get the abridged edition.

40
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,019
Rym: But anyway, it's sci-fi.

41
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,218
Scott: I just don't have time for this shit.

42
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,780
Rym: But it's set in Zimbabwe, in the year 2194.

43
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,320
Scott: It's already a pretty cool setting, I wanna play an RPG in that setting.

44
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:23,437
Rym: Yeah, and it is a pretty cool setting, it's a pretty futuristic Africa, and it has a lot of fun kind of references to the history we've missed in oblique ways, like, "Oh, he's from the English tribe, yeah, something happened to

45
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:23,658
Rym: them.".

46
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:24,296
Scott: Yeah.

47
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:31,539
Rym: But, in case you have not listened to a book club episode before, we have already read the book.

48
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,478
Rym: This is the conclusion to the reading of "The Ear, The Eye, The

49
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:34,659
Rym: Arm.".

50
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:42,200
Rym: So, we're gonna spoil the ever-living crap out of this book, and we're going to talk about it, assuming that you know the plot and have already read it.

51
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:49,480
Scott: And as I say every time, there is scientific evidence to suggest that actually, books are more enjoyable when you know about them.

52
00:01:49,802 --> 00:01:50,820
Scott: And not just books, anything.

53
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,540
Scott: Spoilers actually make things better, they don't make them worse.

54
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,020
Rym: Now granted, your scientific evidence is one study on a small sample size.

55
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,240
Scott: Contrary to what you would normally, to common sense, spoilers make things better.

56
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,360
Rym: In one study on a small sample.

57
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:13,629
Scott: Also, just logically, if something is good, that means that it's good multiple times, which means it's still good.

58
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:15,880
Scott: the second go when you already know everything's gonna happen.

59
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,800
Scott: "Empire Strikes Back," still good the second time.

60
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,900
Rym: But Scott, would you have enjoyed Monica as much had I, before you watch it, told you exactly what happens in episode 10?

61
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,167
Scott:  Yes.

62
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:26,700
Scott:  Really?

63
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,694
Scott:  I just don't think-- - Really?

64
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:29,880
Scott: You may not think you would, but you would have.

65
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,660
Rym: See, Scott, you say that, but I do kind of disagree, and that one study does not a coherent argument make.

66
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:37,719
Scott: I have no problem with anything being spoiled for me.

67
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,836
Scott:  That's all I'm saying.

68
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:39,000
Scott:  Okay.

69
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:43,960
Rym: Anyway, so, you might not want to listen if you haven't read the book, because you're not gonna know what we're talking about.

70
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,840
Scott: That's awesome, but, you know, maybe you'll catch on.

71
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,360
Rym:  I did like-- - Maybe you'll get interested "The Eye and The Arm" as characters, because it's weird.

72
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,880
Scott: They were actually my favorite characters.

73
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:02,235
Rym: Any time I read a new book, whenever there's-- There's certain kinds of characters that I expect them to be boring, and I expect to just like, "Oh, I just want to get past these guys and get to what I really care

74
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:02,459
Rym: about.".

75
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,468
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

76
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:06,900
Scott: A lot of books use that technique of having characters in different places.

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,459
Scott: They split the party as it goes, and they'll focus.

78
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,700
Scott: Each chapter will teleport between the different areas, and eventually the characters meet or interact in some way.

79
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:17,620
Scott: But so far, they've all been separate.

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,560
Scott: So you're going, it's like-- Let me think of a good example.

81
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,594
Scott: "Judging Eye" is like, "Momem, great ordeal," you know, and then "Skin

82
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:27,898
Scott: Eaters.".

83
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,315
Scott: "Momem, great ordeal, Skin

84
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:29,558
Scott: Eaters.".

85
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,939
Scott: It goes-- Oh, my microphone's falling over.

86
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:34,279
Scott: It goes around in a little circle like that, you know?

87
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,280
Scott: So when that happens, quite often, there's only one or two of those you care about more than the others.

88
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:47,018
Scott: So when you're reading the other one that you don't care about as much, you're just, "Hurry up, I want to get back to the good part with the other guy that I care about

89
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:47,139
Scott: more.".

90
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,014
Rym: Actually, the only one I didn't care about there was the whole "White Luck Warrior" subset of

91
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:51,316
Rym: "Momem.".

92
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,019
Rym: 'Cause while I cared about it, I really just wanted to find out what was going on up north.

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,077
Scott: Yeah, right, well, north is where all the secrets are, right?

94
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,580
Scott: But yeah, you know, a lot of things will do that.

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,160
Scott: There'll be secret stuff, and there'll be less secret stuff, and it's like, you just want to go for the most secret stuff all the time.

96
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:20,730
Rym: But I really like "The Ear, the Eye, the Arm," because they were kind of incompetent, and they fought with each other, and they were kind of jerks, but then they ribbed each other the way real friends rib each other, kind of like in

97
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,079
Rym: "Ponies.".

98
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:23,139
Scott: Great, more ponies in the show.

99
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:31,400
Scott: But yeah, it's like, they're the detectives, they're trying to solve the mystery, they have superpowers, but their superpowers are actually just handicaps.

100
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,839
Rym: Their superpower is literally, "Show up five seconds after they should have showed

101
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:35,960
Rym: up.".

102
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:41,180
Scott: Right, and it's like, they were detectiving okay, but they never actually investigated in a Sherlock Holmes way.

103
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:50,839
Scott: It's like, they didn't have detective skills that much, they just sort of always ended up in the right place slightly before everyone else, but always after they needed to show up there.

104
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:53,640
Scott: And it was just like, are these guys even fucking helping?

105
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,539
Rym: They really weren't.

106
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,240
Rym: Until the very end, they had no impact on the kids.

107
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:04,880
Rym: All they did was basically reassure Mastika and his wife that they were alive.

108
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,940
Scott: So it's weird that the title of the book is named after them, when they're actually not the main characters.

109
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:17,538
Scott: They're not in the book really all that much, and they don't really play into it all that much.

110
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,540
Rym: Until the end, when they kinda deus ex machina their way to victory.

111
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,780
Scott: Yeah, and it's sort of like, they tried to pass it off as like, I was hoping for more detective action, but there really wasn't any at all.

112
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,040
Rym: But, they did do what you always want them to do, they worked with their feet, and their legs, and their ears, eyes, and arms.

113
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,257
Scott: Yeah, they definitely had the Odoro Daisou-Souzen Menta Daisou-Souzen.

114
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:49,726
Rym: When the kids just got out of Rest Haven and went into the subway stupidly, and ears like, "I hear something in the subway," and the other guy's like, "Shut up.

115
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:51,133
Scott: We got

116
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:51,375
Scott: this.".

117
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,214
Rym: But then later they're like, "Yeah, you were right, we were

118
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:54,557
Rym: stupid.".

119
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:58,700
Scott: Anyway, in case you haven't read it, just quickly, right?

120
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,660
Scott: Basically, you have some kids, their dad is mad rich, he's the general.

121
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,160
Scott: He's a super important person.

122
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,128
Scott: I get the impression he's kind of the dictator of Zimbabwe.

123
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,120
Scott: I think he's the sub-dictator.

124
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:12,000
Scott: I don't think he's the dictator-dictator.

125
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,930
Scott: He might be the dictator-dictator.

126
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,279
Scott: It didn't seem like it, though.

127
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,520
Scott: Regardless, he's either the dictator or one below the dictator.

128
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,379
Scott: He's super important.

129
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,520
Scott: These are his kids, he's uber protective of them, right?

130
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:24,480
Scott: So they haven't seen the world at all.

131
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,660
Scott: One day they escape, and he's so worried that they were kidnapped.

132
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,852
Scott: So I'm thinking, "Oh, they're not gonna get

133
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:29,297
Scott: kidnapped.".

134
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:31,620
Scott: But of course, they fucking do immediately.

135
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,120
Rym: I love how them getting kidnapped is actually just random bullshit.

136
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,184
Scott: Yeah, right?

137
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:38,884
Scott: It's sort of like, on the one hand, it's like, "Oh, really?

138
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:41,779
Scott: You're supporting all this parental worrying of kids going

139
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,000
Scott: out.".

140
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,919
Rym: Oh, but the world that is described in this book is fucking dangerous, and people do get robbed and kidnapped all the time, as far as I can tell.

141
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:57,600
Scott: So as the kids are kidnapped, they go from place to place, either by escaping or running away or getting double kidnapped from the kidnappers, right?

142
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:07,080
Scott: And they end up going to all these different places, and each of the different places they go has a different sort of moral lesson to teach to add up to the big moral lesson of the whole book.

143
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:10,280
Rym: Which is, immigrants ruin your country.

144
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:12,695
Scott: That's your moral lesson?

145
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,324
Rym: We'll get to that.

146
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,620
Rym: I was kind of disappointed in that at the end.

147
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,180
Rym: Yeah, so basically, I mean, look at Rest Haven.

148
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,680
Rym: It's kind of this, "Yeah, the old ways are traditional, and they're really good in some

149
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:24,780
Rym: ways.".

150
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,899
Scott: Well, the Rest Haven's the third place.

151
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Rym: I just want to start it with, because it was such a stark... Like, every setting was presented in, "Hey, this place is great.

152
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:36,497
Rym: Oh, check out how different this place is from everything

153
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:36,739
Rym: else.".

154
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:38,940
Rym: Oh, look, it's all so shitty.

155
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,980
Rym: It's like, the past had problems, the future has problems, every time has problems.

156
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,020
Rym: There is this kind of moral that you have to just keep going forward, and there's no such thing as this perfect nostalgia for the past.

157
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,520
Rym: At no matter, any point in time was good and bad combined.

158
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:03,520
Scott: Yeah, that's my favorite thing about the whole book, is you look, and so many people in the world will always try to teach some kind of lesson.

159
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,360
Rym: In the '90s, anime was the best.

160
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,600
Scott: It's really popular right now for people to be like, "Natural things are great.

161
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,856
Scott: Unnatural things are not

162
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:11,119
Scott: great.".

163
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,218
Scott: Or, "The olden days, when men were men, was great, and nowadays

164
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:15,580
Scott: sucks.".

165
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,820
Rym: Back in the '50s, when women knew their place and made coffee.

166
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,737
Scott: Yeah, or even people would be like, "Modern times are great, and the olden times

167
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:22,080
Scott: sucked.".

168
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:27,120
Scott: You know, everyone is... Someone always is comparing one thing better than another thing.

169
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:33,236
Scott: Even great sci-fi novels, like Brave New World, will be like, "This is great, and this is not so

170
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:33,399
Scott: great.".

171
00:08:34,662 --> 00:08:38,418
Scott: But here, the arm is like, "Look, everything has positives, and everything has

172
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:38,799
Scott: negatives.".

173
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,697
Scott: There is no great, and there is no...

174
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:49,540
Rym: Every one of these little settings, because they were kind of like settings, like individual stories within, and then there'd be like a link with the ear, the eye, and the arm showing up too late to save everybody.

175
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:56,060
Scott: It's almost like being transported between different separate worlds, and almost like a space train.

176
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:59,419
Scott: You go to the different planets, and each planet has a different lesson to tell you.

177
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:01,199
Scott: Only there's only three or four planets.

178
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,340
Scott: As opposed to like a zillion.

179
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,796
Rym: But each one also makes a lot of various points.

180
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,820
Rym: They're kind of all over the place about society in general.

181
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,316
Rym: Like, "Look at this kind of

182
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:12,619
Rym: place."

183
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:19,557
Rym: Like the stupid British lady at the end, who was all, "Oh, my dinner party outside would be ruined by you, all the

184
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:20,139
Rym: children!".

185
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,340
Rym: That one felt kind of snow-crashy, actually.

186
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,340
Scott: Yeah, it definitely felt like they were in some sort of weird, not real-world kind of place.

187
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,699
Rym: That one stood out as...

188
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,660
Scott: It was almost like a surreal VR kind of situation.

189
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:36,780
Scott: At least that's what I felt like.

190
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:38,179
Scott: It was very burbclave.

191
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:41,699
Scott: Yeah, like it was a scary, fake place they were in.

192
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:50,160
Rym: Granted, I can see it is interesting, because look at it from the perspective of, like, say you know African culture the way that we know our own white dude culture.

193
00:09:52,503 --> 00:10:00,219
Rym: So, in that sense, imagine us describing a culture that we see from the outside, but don't get much insight into.

194
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,280
Rym: It's almost like that part was a... Like, that's how ridiculous this lifestyle looks to a complete outsider.

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,497
Rym: Mmm, that's true.

196
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,579
Rym: Like, I know something about this particular culture, but I see them doing the things, and it just seems really fucked up to me.

197
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,634
Rym: Like, I love how they describe that cradle as basically like.

198
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:17,580
Rym: they think it's a cage.

199
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:19,500
Scott: Yeah.

200
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,840
Rym: Kind of was a cage, though.

201
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,660
Scott: Well, no, actually I read it as being a literal cage.

202
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Scott: I thought he was literally, like, in a cage.

203
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:28,340
Rym: There are things like that.

204
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,140
Scott: With metal and a lock on it and shit.

205
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,838
Scott: That's how I read it.

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,940
Scott: You thought it was just a cradle, and they interpreted it as a cage?

207
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,419
Rym: Well, it was a cradle with a cage cover to keep kids in.

208
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,840
Scott: Yeah, I thought it was a literal steel prison.

209
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,576
Rym: It was, but it was a cradle that was like... I think of it this way, these British people are like, "Yeah, that's what you do to a sick kid, to keep him in

210
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:45,818
Rym: bed.".

211
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:48,936
Rym: And the Zimbabweans are like, "What the fuck is wrong with you?

212
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:49,259
Rym: It's a

213
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:49,440
Rym: cage.".

214
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:50,933
Scott: So, how about the...

215
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,920
Rym: The Blay people?

216
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,680
Scott: No, the guy... The fuckin'... Freshman?

217
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:57,999
Scott: No, the praising guy.

218
00:10:58,463 --> 00:10:59,409
Rym: Oh, the praise singer.

219
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,980
Rym: I like their religion.

220
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:03,280
Scott: Right, so this is praise singer.

221
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,339
Rym: He's such a wuss.

222
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,239
Rym: Like, his character was so awesome, and then it was so crap by the end.

223
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,460
Scott: Yeah, so basically the praise singer is sort of a kellis-ish kind of individual, right?

224
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,740
Scott: Basically, he has this skill, I guess he's practiced it or trained in it, where his job is to just sing praises.

225
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,240
Scott: So it's like, you know, they're sitting at the breakfast table, and this guy comes in, they pay him, he's an employee.

226
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,480
Scott: He's also sort of the kid's tutor, also, independent of praise singing.

227
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:30,235
Scott: And he comes in and says, "Oh, Rym, you are so great.

228
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:31,299
Scott: Oh, Scott, you are the

229
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:31,600
Scott: best.".

230
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:33,019
Scott: And he tells you why you're the best.

231
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:40,140
Scott: And he has such a great psychological effect that you almost lose yourself in the praise, and he just makes you feel great.

232
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:43,520
Scott: It's almost like drugs, but they go in your ears in the forms of words.

233
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:45,360
Scott: He's so good at it, he has such power.

234
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:56,060
Scott: So the family pays him to do this, and he uses his praising abilities, like hypnotize the dad, and that's what lets the kids leave the house and get you kidnapped.

235
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:59,137
Scott: So after that, the dad's like, "Yeah, praise singer, I don't like your shit

236
00:11:59,158 --> 00:11:59,479
Scott: anymore.".

237
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,700
Rym: The thing is, I like the praise singer, but he was so cringing and just pathetic by the end that I gave up on him.

238
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:20,998
Scott: Yeah, it's like, on the one hand, I thought it was sort of a cool thing that they would do this, but it also had clearly that anti, you know, it's like, yeah, it's kind of cool to have this praise singing, but on the other hand, it's like, yeah, this psychological manipulation

239
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:23,080
Rym: is probably-- Well, platitudes can only get you so far.

240
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:27,180
Rym: And there's a line in the end, I think Ai says something like, "Praise is like a vitamin.

241
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,854
Rym: A little bit is necessary to survive, but too much

242
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:32,259
Rym: death.".

243
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:32,999
Scott: Exactly.

244
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:42,517
Scott: But at least at the end, while the praise singer was sort of ruined, they were like, "Okay, you can stay, you just can't praise anymore with your psychologically manipulating

245
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:42,838
Scott: people.".

246
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,320
Rym: But he still goes and praises for Eri and Arm.

247
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:45,973
Scott: Yeah.

248
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:46,431
Rym: Yeah.

249
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:47,256
Scott: But they need it.

250
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:50,400
Rym: So, I mean, look at the Vlaie people, though.

251
00:12:50,520 --> 00:13:00,300
Rym: That was kind of a, there's a whole story of like reclaiming the land that was fucked by the modern technology and this kind of like twilight life between the modern world and the ancient world.

252
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,120
Scott: Well, I mean, what was the name of the big fat, the elephant?

253
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,616
Scott: Oh, the elephant.

254
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,227
Scott: Yeah.

255
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,340
Scott: All right, so the she-elephant was sort of like, you know, typical, they started off-- You know what she reminded me of?

256
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,220
Rym: A Lopta villain.

257
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,480
Rym: Like the Lopta pirates.

258
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,340
Rym: She's bad, but she's not that bad.

259
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,540
Scott: It felt just like a Miyazaki kidnapping, right?

260
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:24,860
Scott: It's like you're kidnapped, we're making you dig in the mines, but we're feeding you and we sort of, even though we're bad, evil kidnappers making you do slave labor, basically.

261
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,438
Scott: And at the end-- We're not all bad.

262
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,499
Rym: And at the end, she sells them to the masks and the masks are like, "We're gonna kill

263
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:29,640
Rym: 'em.".

264
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,392
Rym: And she's like, "Uh, that's not cool.

265
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:33,598
Rym: I'm gonna smash your stupid

266
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:33,999
Rym: mask.".

267
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:34,495
Rym: Right.

268
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:42,540
Scott: You know, it's sort of like, you know, while they were doing an evil thing, it's like they weren't just all bad people who were just straight up evil.

269
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:48,599
Rym: Look at the message at the end when the spirit of the land inhabits the arm to do all the, you know, the deus ex machina at the end.

270
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,640
Rym: Magic is real, gods are real.

271
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:52,339
Rym: I was kind of disappointed in that.

272
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,011
Scott: Kind of.

273
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,860
Scott: But anyway-- Especially in a sci-fi world.

274
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:13,820
Rym: But they make it very clear that he's like, when Tendai has kind of the vision of, you know, the spirit of the land and of this culture and the people, he looks at everyone in the room, even the she-elephant, and everyone in the city and the country and whatever, and realizes that there's one kind of bad that's just a part of society.

275
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:17,680
Rym: And then there's this other kind of bad that is dirty illegal immigrants.

276
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,579
Rym: I just, I can't, I was really bothered by that.

277
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:30,440
Rym: That message would have been cool except for the fact that the plot in the end was, everything was fine until these Gondwanans with their bad culture started moving into our town.

278
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,323
Rym: Yeah, you know, it's sort of like-- Especially because the mother, Matsika's wife, says at one point when she thinks, "Oh, it's the Gondwanans,".

279
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:48,620
Rym: she remembers a time in their past when some other tribe moved into their land and they were just as bad and they had to kick them out too and then it fixed everything.

280
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,720
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like you had this, you know, thing where like there were the masks, like these unseen bad guys that everyone was always worried about.

281
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:56,736
Scott: I liked the masks.

282
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:04,680
Scott: They were the internal, you know, illegal criminal gang and you also had this external threat that they were always fighting with but, you know, they had managed to fend them off.

283
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,840
Scott: And then it turned out in the end, of course, that they were one and the same, right?

284
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,220
Scott: That the Gondwanans were waging an external war in the disguise of being an internal threat.

285
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,299
Rym: But they were just evil.

286
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,178
Scott: It would be like if there was an evil terrorist but they were the mafia.

287
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,320
Scott: Like the mafia turned out to be Islamic fundamentalist terrorist crazies.

288
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:33,500
Rym: But like I thought the masks were like big fire but it turned out they're just immigrants with different gods who are just straight up murdering, sacrificing evil.

289
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:34,200
Scott: Yeah.

290
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:37,511
Scott: It's like I would have been happier with the message.

291
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:41,760
Scott: more of like, you know, okay, look, you know, people from other countries are cool too.

292
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:47,239
Scott: They have the goods and their bads just like all the different places within your country have the goods and the bads.

293
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,958
Scott: The other country also has its goods and its bads.

294
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,880
Scott: There's probably some, you know, masks in Gondwana that are from your country, right?

295
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:03,860
Rym: Well, there was that little note at the end like the Gondwanans were sent back to their country and they all met unpleasant ends for having lost their masks.

296
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:08,036
Rym: But until we met the masks in the very end.

297
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Scott: Well, there was that one scene where they jumped on the subway.

298
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:19,279
Rym: And when you first meet them and they're all like whispering and gibbering and like moving around and then when Tenai knocks the mask off, it's just a Shelby old man.

299
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:22,140
Rym: They were a lot like big fire.

300
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,260
Rym: But once the moral came out, they were just kind of, I don't know, I was disappointed in that.

301
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:28,626
Scott: Yeah.

302
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:30,500
Scott: It could have been way cooler.

303
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,447
Rym: I love their graffiti.

304
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,479
Rym: That whole slogan of never look behind a mask.

305
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:42,911
Rym: That aesthetic was neat that you go down into the subway and it's kind of like, yeah, they own the subway and you see this just written everywhere.

306
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:44,199
Rym: Never look behind a mask.

307
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:46,285
Scott: But it's like I actually liked that.

308
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:50,800
Scott: It was like, you know, you have these evil, you know, criminal mafia kind of guys.

309
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,663
Scott: And they don't want money.

310
00:16:51,704 --> 00:16:55,760
Rym: They'll murder a hundred people and leave their money on top of the bodies to remind you.

311
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,884
Scott: In a crazy cult.

312
00:16:57,527 --> 00:17:00,579
Scott: And then the fact that they're just schlubby guys like everyone else, just like the KKK.

313
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,282
Scott: Right.

314
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:03,380
Scott: They take the hoods off and they're just schlubby guys.

315
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:11,920
Rym: But the fact that, no, they're also the government of Gondwana and they're actively trying to bring their objectively bad Gondwanian culture into Zimbabwe and ruin it.

316
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,142
Scott: Right.

317
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,337
Scott: That was the step too far.

318
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:13,540
Scott: Right.

319
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Scott: If they would have just stopped at schlubby guys, you know, the KKK is just schlubby guys and they don't have their hoods on.

320
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:19,969
Scott: That would have been cool with that.

321
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:20,332
Scott: Right.

322
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,280
Scott: That was that was pretty good.

323
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:27,759
Rym: Or if these guys were just bad, not everyone from Gondwana is bad and everyone from every other tribe is bad, too.

324
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,602
Rym: Yeah.

325
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:29,285
Scott: I don't know.

326
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:31,074
Scott: Anyway, what else?

327
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:32,300
Scott: what else is there to say about this?

328
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,626
Rym: I like Maztika.

329
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:35,579
Rym: whenever we got to meet him.

330
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,000
Scott: I actually like the the who's the dumb guy's name?

331
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,916
Scott: It's actually a trash man was way cool.

332
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:42,620
Scott: Right.

333
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,540
Scott: Because it's always cool when you have that character.

334
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:49,900
Scott: And it's sort of like, you know, they try to suggest he's got like mentally retarded in some way.

335
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:51,668
Scott: But he's not really right.

336
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,079
Scott: He's just one of those guys who doesn't say anything, really.

337
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:56,491
Rym: You know, he's kind of one of those mystical.

338
00:17:56,873 --> 00:17:58,300
Rym: you don't know how he gets in and out.

339
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,186
Rym: Like he probably keeps like.

340
00:17:59,206 --> 00:18:00,900
Rym: they say, oh, he's probably back in Rest Haven.

341
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:02,037
Rym: Like, how do you even get in there?

342
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:02,240
Scott: Right.

343
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,880
Scott: You know how we always say, like, you can't tell the difference between incompetence and evil.

344
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,702
Scott: This is like.

345
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:12,960
Scott: can't tell the indifference between incompetence in accidental, you know, being incompetent and accidentally being awesome.

346
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,080
Rym: Like that Bill Murray movie, The Man Who Knew Too Little.

347
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,481
Scott: Right.

348
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:19,832
Scott: Or it's like your favorite captain.

349
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:20,714
Scott: What's his face?

350
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,637
Scott: Captain Tyler.

351
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:22,519
Rym: Captain Tyler.

352
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:22,920
Rym: Yes.

353
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,518
Rym: Thing is, I'm pretty sure he was genius.

354
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:25,820
Scott: Right.

355
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,448
Scott: But the point is, is it's sort of that same thing.

356
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:32,680
Scott: where it's like, you know, he I mean, he's acting way dumber than Tyler acted, of course.

357
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:33,062
Scott: Right.

358
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:36,080
Scott: He's acting like he has, you know, actual problems in his brain.

359
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,311
Rym: He probably does.

360
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:38,020
Scott: Probably does.

361
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:42,260
Scott: But, you know, he manages to get along and actually pull off a bunch of awesome.

362
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:45,640
Scott: Especially when he comes and saves and saves the day at the old bridge.

363
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:47,440
Scott: Like he says, yes, that was totally course.

364
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,820
Rym: He also ruined the day by sitting outside and letting the elephant know where they were.

365
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,762
Scott: Yeah, that was also a problem.

366
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:58,672
Rym: But, you know, I just I didn't like I wasn't sure where this book was going to go, but I think I really started enjoying it.

367
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:03,620
Rym: when after the kids get kidnapped and whatever and the ear, the eye, the arm go off to investigate.

368
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:07,800
Rym: And they always they show up late and they get injured every time.

369
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,940
Rym: And that one doctor's like, Jesus, you guys stop.

370
00:19:11,081 --> 00:19:14,780
Scott: It's like they even went into rest haven with a pretty good plan of acting like the monster.

371
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,825
Scott: Their plan was great.

372
00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:17,114
Scott: That was going to work to work.

373
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:18,606
Scott: You're right.

374
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:19,739
Scott: But the kids had already left.

375
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:20,864
Rym: It was too late.

376
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:24,400
Scott: But if they would have showed up when the kids were there, that would have been crazy awesome.

377
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,800
Rym: I love how their plan was literally ooga booga booga.

378
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:36,180
Scott: I actually kind of wish they reordered the book a little bit and had the rest haven be the last place and then actually have them save them with that monster strategy.

379
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:36,987
Scott: That would have been fun.

380
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:38,499
Scott: Totally fun.

381
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,041
Scott: Yeah.

382
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:41,083
Rym: I also very much enjoyed.

383
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:56,420
Rym: I want to start using this as a turn of phrase, because when in rest haven, when they're doing the traditional storytelling and that whole thing was really neat, like the cult, like you're like seeing the view of the culture of tend I like knew like when to do what and when to say what and put my fist like this and act like this or like.

384
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,241
Rym: All right.

385
00:19:57,301 --> 00:20:06,560
Rym: That kid who doesn't know, you know, I've studied this culture, made two mounds that represent my mother's breast, and he knocked them down to thereby disrespect my mother.

386
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:08,448
Scott: Oh, the fight.

387
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:11,080
Rym: I don't care about that because that's kind of weird.

388
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,799
Scott: That's very West Side story.

389
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,580
Rym: But I know Kung Fu and this kid doesn't.

390
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,360
Scott: Sharks and Jets, baby.

391
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:17,821
Rym: Yeah.

392
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:20,211
Rym: But like, you know, he had karate lessons.

393
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:21,939
Rym: He knew he just kicked the kid's ass.

394
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:29,980
Scott: That's you know, that was showing like, look, even, you know, people so culturally, you know, far away from each other still have these like these similar things.

395
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:34,540
Scott: And you can tell what someone's going for at the same time, even though their style is different.

396
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,923
Rym: But at the same time, he didn't feel it.

397
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,367
Rym: He's like, this is really stupid.

398
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:42,680
Rym: I have to go through these motions with this old barbaric culture that talks about cows all the time.

399
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,186
Rym: I don't care about cows.

400
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:45,272
Rym: Oh, my God.

401
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:45,956
Rym: Yeah.

402
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:46,580
Rym: Cows.

403
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,931
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, imagine if you wanted to play.

404
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,380
Rym: They're not curious about anything.

405
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:57,100
Scott: Imagine if you're going to play a board game with someone, but it's sort of like when you go to play Star Wars Jedi Knight and they bow and I just stab them.

406
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,541
Rym: Yep.

407
00:20:57,822 --> 00:20:58,222
Rym: Oh, my God.

408
00:20:58,263 --> 00:20:59,285
Rym: We I loved.

409
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:05,360
Rym: you know, the only thing I enjoyed about that game was stabbing someone while they were trying to bow to me.

410
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:10,320
Rym: That was the only goal I had when I played online was to piss those people off.

411
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:10,844
Rym: Yeah.

412
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:11,087
Scott: I hate it.

413
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:12,200
Scott: when they voted to kick you, though.

414
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:15,918
Rym: And then I just joined the server right then because usually they couldn't get enough votes to ban me.

415
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:16,757
Scott: Yep.

416
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,570
Rym: But the turn of phrase I want to steal is the storytelling.

417
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,540
Rym: where they're like, there was a man and the crowd says, go on.

418
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,069
Rym: The man was in Gondwana.

419
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:28,712
Rym: Go on.

420
00:21:29,013 --> 00:21:29,857
Rym: The man did this.

421
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:30,440
Rym: Go on.

422
00:21:31,002 --> 00:21:35,640
Rym: And when you're done telling the story, you say, and that is when the storyteller died.

423
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:38,206
Rym: I just thought that was really funny.

424
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:40,615
Rym: I really like that.

425
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:41,940
Rym: I want to tell stories like that.

426
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,679
Scott: You could do it, but I'm not going to say go on that many times.

427
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,180
Rym: I'm eventually just like, I'm going to start ending every every anecdote where I tell with and that's where the storyteller died.

428
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:51,883
Scott: Sure.

429
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:52,388
Scott: Go for it.

430
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:52,671
Scott: Yeah.

431
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:53,539
Scott: Good luck with that.

432
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,400
Scott: So one thing I do want to talk about is the fact that, you know, this is a young adult novel.

433
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,879
Scott: It was really easy to read and didn't take much time at all.

434
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:09,340
Scott: And it's sort of like, you know, I've been I don't read that those kind of books that often.

435
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:15,400
Scott: Usually, you know, at least more recently I read books that are age appropriate or at my reading level.

436
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:20,500
Rym: The thing is, they're so like, for example, I'm not saying stuff is very accessible, but very good.

437
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:20,821
Rym: Right.

438
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:25,620
Scott: But I'm not saying that it's you know, it's bad that you shouldn't read books that are easy or whatever.

439
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,960
Scott: You know, there's still some value in plenty of books that are not.

440
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,209
Rym: And the writing was perfectly serviceable.

441
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,093
Rym: It wasn't great.

442
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:33,560
Rym: It wasn't like special.

443
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:40,600
Rym: The phrasing was not like a masterpiece, but at no point did the writing distract me from the story.

444
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,171
Scott: No, but what it is, is it's you know, it's.

445
00:22:43,332 --> 00:22:44,458
Scott: I think it's unique to books.

446
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:44,940
Scott: Right.

447
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,074
Scott: For example, you could watch a TV show that is designed for children.

448
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:49,636
Scott: Right.

449
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:50,560
Scott: And enjoy it.

450
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:56,098
Scott: But it doesn't feel like it was easier or lighter because you're watching.

451
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:56,680
Scott: It's the same.

452
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:57,684
Rym: I disagree.

453
00:22:57,905 --> 00:23:01,320
Rym: I think so when I watch children's movies, it's like, wow, made for kids.

454
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:02,265
Rym: Wow.

455
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:05,179
Rym: They keep saying the name of the things so the kids don't forget it.

456
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,445
Scott: Oh, really?

457
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:07,353
Scott: I don't I don't notice that.

458
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:07,655
Scott: Really?

459
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:08,220
Rym: I noticed that.

460
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,891
Scott: I mean, I guess I mean all ages stuff.

461
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:10,213
Scott: Right.

462
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:11,120
Scott: Anyway.

463
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:25,820
Scott: But, you know, when you're reading a book that is so, you know, meant for, you know, to be accessible to younger audiences, it necessarily is, you know, has less words, is less harder words, reads faster and more easy, you know.

464
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:29,780
Rym: So even if there was even if the common gobbledygook in here.

465
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,161
Scott: Sure.

466
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:36,220
Scott: But I mean, even if the content is still valuable for, you know, someone who is older and wiser.

467
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:37,122
Scott: Right.

468
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:43,160
Scott: You know, which this that book definitely was, you know, they just feels sort of light as you're reading.

469
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,140
Scott: It has a different feeling as, you know, the work of reading is it feels different.

470
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:55,600
Rym: What made it feel light to me was only that one, I did not have to delve deeply into the language to, you know, find subtext.

471
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,764
Rym: There was very little subtext.

472
00:23:56,904 --> 00:24:02,120
Rym: And two, there was no sacrifice made by any of the protagonists.

473
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:06,880
Rym: They they killed one character and then they brought him back with B.S.

474
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,044
Scott: That's yeah.

475
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:10,340
Rym: I mean, pretty much everyone turned up just fine.

476
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,472
Scott: With his magic circle on a string.

477
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:13,740
Rym: Yeah, the doro.

478
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,164
Scott: Yeah, doro.

479
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:15,746
Scott: Which is made?

480
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:19,400
Scott: it was made of real seashell as opposed to the other ones that are made of fucking ceramic.

481
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,719
Rym: I like how the the traditional like the elder in the village in Rest Haven was pissed off.

482
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:28,313
Rym: He's like, you got to go.

483
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:28,880
Rym: Right.

484
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:35,279
Scott: Like, imagine if you're like the master of, you know, I don't know what's something we like a lot.

485
00:24:36,361 --> 00:24:37,495
Rym: Ah, board games.

486
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:37,940
Scott: Sure.

487
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,340
Scott: You're the master of some board game and some guy shows up who's never played.

488
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,860
Scott: He's not into board games, really.

489
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:51,120
Scott: He just sort of starting out and he's got like first printing settlers from Germany with the stiffy, stiffy guards.

490
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,331
Scott: And he doesn't even know what he's got.

491
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:53,078
Scott: It's like, oh, fuck you.

492
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,380
Scott: You know, meanwhile, you're sitting there with your brand new settlers with chintzy ass pieces.

493
00:24:58,221 --> 00:24:59,445
Scott: You know, it's kind of like that.

494
00:24:59,505 --> 00:25:03,800
Scott: So I can I could empathize with that guy, but just that there was no sacrifice.

495
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,745
Rym: He was a bad guy, though.

496
00:25:04,946 --> 00:25:07,080
Rym: I mean, it was kind of a cop out that used the Nirvana guns.

497
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,800
Rym: But oh, those evil Gondwanans use the soul stealer.

498
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,616
Scott: The Nirvana guns reminded me totally of Hokuto.

499
00:25:12,657 --> 00:25:13,059
Scott: no Ken.

500
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,619
Rym: But but I really liked how they've got the Nirvana guns.

501
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:16,840
Rym: Right.

502
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:25,720
Rym: And when they first go into their first business, the early eye in the arm, one of them's like, we don't have that many bullets or rounds.

503
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:27,443
Rym: So don't waste them.

504
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:34,980
Rym: And then the scene that is described is them firing constantly and with abandon for many minutes.

505
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:39,919
Scott: And pretty much every time the guns are involved, they're just like, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

506
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:40,642
Scott: I see.

507
00:25:40,662 --> 00:25:41,906
Scott: It's weird that they had like.

508
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,840
Scott: on the one hand, I imagine the Nirvana guns being sort of like ray guns or something like that.

509
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,622
Scott: Batteries.

510
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:47,327
Scott: Right.

511
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:48,879
Scott: But it's like, I guess so.

512
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:49,722
Scott: But it's like.

513
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:50,930
Scott: but then they talked about rounds.

514
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,580
Scott: I'm like, oh, I guess they shoot bullets or something.

515
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,063
Scott: I don't know.

516
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:53,768
Scott: I don't know.

517
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:55,360
Scott: It's sort of I wasn't entirely sure.

518
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,280
Scott: Like a lot of the things, a lot of the physical things that were described, I didn't get a good feeling for.

519
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,893
Scott: Like they described the incredibly mile high tower.

520
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:04,497
Scott: What was it called?

521
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:05,120
Rym: The McElwain.

522
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:06,062
Scott: Right.

523
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:10,960
Scott: You know, this incredibly tall tower where all the cool stuff is and the fancy restaurant and the client, you know, where everything.

524
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:17,600
Scott: And I, you know, I sort of got the idea that, you know, they were in this gigantically tall tower, but I couldn't really get a good picture of it.

525
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,139
Scott: Like the cars are flying, but you couldn't really get it.

526
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,018
Scott: You know, it's like they didn't go into incredible detail about the shape of things.

527
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:25,903
Rym: Oh, yeah.

528
00:26:25,923 --> 00:26:27,620
Rym: The descriptions and everything were very sparse.

529
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,780
Rym: Like there's one point like the Nirvana gun.

530
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,986
Scott: OK, I didn't really.

531
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,020
Scott: I couldn't really picture a Nirvana gun fully in my head.

532
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:41,280
Scott: I started to go with my own imagination, which is I think this book would feel very different depending who's reading it, just because so much is left to the imagination.

533
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:49,860
Rym: But I like how like when he describes a large woman, when one of them encounters a large woman, the elephant, the line is something like she was large.

534
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:53,900
Rym: No, majestic and majestic was italicized.

535
00:26:54,161 --> 00:26:55,086
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

536
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:57,319
Scott: how large do you imagine the elephant woman to be?

537
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,625
Rym: Oh, my goodness.

538
00:26:58,766 --> 00:27:01,639
Rym: I imagine her not being because she could walk.

539
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:09,080
Rym: I imagine her not being fat and like horribly obese, like the people I often see waddling around downtown in the tourist district.

540
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:17,240
Rym: But I imagine her being like just this gigantic, slightly flabby woman who is stronger than anyone else you will ever meet.

541
00:27:18,562 --> 00:27:22,160
Rym: I just I just imagine she picks the kids up like by their head and just like holds.

542
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:22,742
Scott: Right.

543
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:25,500
Scott: Because of that, I imagined her as sort of like a fan.

544
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,740
Scott: You know, it's already a fantasy world, the Nirvana guns in the ear, eye and arm.

545
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:35,360
Scott: So I was sort of imagining her being more like the ear, the eye and the arm, like freakishly unnatural, could not exist in the real world.

546
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,100
Scott: Gigantic, like maybe half as big as an elephant.

547
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Rym: No, I just pictured a normally gigantic woman.

548
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,560
Scott: I pictured her actually being just ginormous.

549
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,760
Rym: Scott, you forget how tiny kids the age of these main characters are.

550
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,112
Scott: Oh, that is also true.

551
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:48,960
Scott: They were very tiny.

552
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,680
Rym: Not that long ago, we rode school buses when we went to that Mets game, remember?

553
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:54,360
Scott: Yeah, I was on a school bus recently.

554
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,700
Rym: Yeah, we go in the school bus and I'm like, oh, wow, I used to sit three across.

555
00:27:57,862 --> 00:27:59,399
Rym: And now, like, I don't even fit in one of these.

556
00:27:59,682 --> 00:28:00,179
Scott: Yeah, right.

557
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,519
Scott: Kids are tiny.

558
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,304
Scott: But maybe that's another thing.

559
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:07,940
Scott: is that, you know, if you read this as a kid, then the imagination you put into is completely different.

560
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:08,442
Scott: Right.

561
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:11,800
Scott: In your because you imagine a bigger world and different sizes of things.

562
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:14,680
Rym: And, you know, I mean, really, it was a great book.

563
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,080
Rym: And the only things that annoy me are, oh, my God, the gods are real.

564
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:23,059
Rym: And the God just says, hey, arm, go here and do this.

565
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:24,719
Rym: And that's the answer.

566
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,259
Rym: Yeah, everything will work out.

567
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
Scott: I would have I would have to improve this book.

568
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,680
Scott: I would only put in more real detective work, you know, for reals.

569
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:33,920
Rym: And of course, you know, damn dirty immigrants.

570
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:34,402
Rym: Yeah.

571
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:37,560
Scott: And the idea in the arm, they had these powers that were mostly handicapped.

572
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,699
Rym: I liked how that was cool.

573
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,804
Scott: That was cool.

574
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:42,620
Scott: But I would have liked to see them also be beneficial more.

575
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,100
Rym: They were oogie boogie boogie.

576
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:47,540
Scott: Yeah, but if they were to use their powers to benefit like one.

577
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,719
Rym: Also, I totally heard them.

578
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:51,220
Scott: He totally did.

579
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:57,460
Scott: But it would have been cool if like one more time their powers actually helped instead of hurt or helped and hurt simultaneously.

580
00:28:59,220 --> 00:28:59,597
Scott: Simultaneously.

581
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:02,780
Rym: Anyway, I do like our rest haven.

582
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:06,100
Rym: Like he heard them like rolling boulders up against the gates.

583
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:11,577
Rym: And the one taxi driver is like, hey, last time they did that, it was 15 years before I heard a peep out of him.

584
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:13,560
Scott: It's weird.

585
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,140
Scott: Like, you know, this rest have in place and a taxi right outside of it.

586
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,940
Rym: Well, because right outside is like probably the equivalent of Alphabet City in New York, like the kind of low income, but not lowest income housing.

587
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,600
Scott: No, I think it was like a suburb, right?

588
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,220
Rym: Yeah, it was like a mid like middle lower middle class to middle class suburb.

589
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,522
Scott: It was weird.

590
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:33,139
Scott: The suburb, like the suburb was like on the edge of the scary desert where the she elephant lived.

591
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:37,280
Scott: I imagine like this like desert, desert, desert, suddenly white fences.

592
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:44,020
Rym: I gave up on any concept of the geography of this book pretty much right away.

593
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:45,579
Scott: Yeah, and I think, I don't know.

594
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,200
Rym: It's like vlay, vlay, vlay, cement line houses.

595
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,525
Scott: Yeah, it's like, really?

596
00:29:50,868 --> 00:29:51,957
Scott: Okay, sure.

597
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:52,380
Scott: That's weird.

598
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,719
Rym: I like how two different bus drivers are like, fuck this shit.

599
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:02,060
Rym: And oh, and how every time, so many times the ear of the eye of the arm show up, they're like, we have a plan, must go quietly.

600
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,280
Rym: And then guns a blazing, they yell Mustika's name.

601
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,799
Rym: Everyone else hears it and flips the fuck out and it's just chaos.

602
00:30:08,243 --> 00:30:09,478
Rym: And then the SWAT team comes in.

603
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,720
Scott: Yeah, good job, guys.

604
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:16,039
Rym: They were kind of incompetent, but they were funny enough to where I was okay with that.

605
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,084
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

606
00:30:17,205 --> 00:30:25,680
Scott: It would have been, I think it might have been better maybe if, you know, good balance, like if one of them was more competent and one of them was less competent and you had a Three Stooges situation.

607
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,358
Scott: Ah, the arm.

608
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,879
Scott: You know, you get a little straight man, funny man going.

609
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,239
Rym: The arm and the eye did a lot more than the ear, but that's partly because they didn't listen to the ear when they should have.

610
00:30:38,345 --> 00:30:39,420
Rym: But then the eye passed out.

611
00:30:39,763 --> 00:30:41,640
Scott: Definitely most of the focus was on the arm.

612
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,039
Scott: The ear and the eye really didn't do all that much.

613
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,839
Rym: Yeah, well the arm psychic stuff really overpowered everything else.

614
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,380
Scott: Yeah, it was mostly arm because he was the one who suffered the most and also did the most.

615
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,960
Scott: And he had the whole situation with like, you know, the baby and whatever.

616
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,220
Scott: It's like, you know, whatever.

617
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,179
Rym: That baby part could have not been in the book.

618
00:30:59,822 --> 00:31:00,630
Rym: It didn't really, like.

619
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:01,520
Rym: it just was extra.

620
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,599
Rym: So, it's your turn to pick a book.

621
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,480
Scott: We're going to do double book.

622
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:09,320
Rym: Double book.

623
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:10,098
Scott: Double book.

624
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,320
Rym: Bear in mind the precedent you are setting, Scott, for I pick next.

625
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,416
Scott: Okay, well you know I wanted to do The Little Prince.

626
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:18,840
Scott: You did.

627
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,840
Scott: The problem is The Little Prince, you can read that shit in like a couple hours if you're not two years old, right?

628
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:29,139
Scott: So, that's probably one of the best books there ever was.

629
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:32,019
Scott: Which is why you're going to fucking read it, because I told you to.

630
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:35,980
Rym: But it takes you like- You're going to learn about the best tree in the world.

631
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,779
Scott: Sure are, and the snake too.

632
00:31:38,008 --> 00:31:38,278
Rym: Oh yeah.

633
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:43,120
Scott: But, you're going to read it in a day, so you don't need a month to read this shit.

634
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,039
Scott: We could do the book club on it friggin' next week.

635
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:51,600
Scott: So, I have to add an additional book to double it up to make the book a month worthwhile.

636
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,259
Scott: Alright.

637
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,160
Scott: So, I need an additional book that goes with The Little Prince.

638
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,671
Scott: Well, what could fucking go with it?

639
00:31:57,691 --> 00:31:58,820
Scott: I'll tell you what goes with it.

640
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,480
Rym: Prince of Nothing?

641
00:31:59,840 --> 00:31:59,882
Rym: No.

642
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,620
Scott: Wind, Sand, and Stars, also by Antoine de Saint-Ejuperi.

643
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:08,080
Rym: I have never read that.

644
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,620
Scott: Most people haven't, because, you know, a lot of people have read The Little Prince and know what it's about.

645
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,720
Scott: Very few people actually bother to pay any attention to the man who wrote it.

646
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:23,600
Scott: Antoine de Saint-Ejuperi is probably one of the greatest people to have ever lived in the history of the universe.

647
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,720
Rym: His Wikipedia article is worth a gander.

648
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:35,080
Scott: Yeah, so, just imagine if Porco Rosso was a real fucking person, and everything about him is absolutely true.

649
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,328
Scott: Like, dude, you know how he died?

650
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:42,260
Scott: He went out to fly on a plane mission and didn't return.

651
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,178
Rym: He's out there somewhere, still circling.

652
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,639
Scott: He literally was, like, delivering the mail by plane during the war.

653
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,480
Scott: He was a national treasure of ze France.

654
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,740
Scott: This dude was fucking epic.

655
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,820
Scott: So, you're gonna read this book about him being fucking epic right here.

656
00:32:58,241 --> 00:32:59,360
Scott: Let us read the product description.

657
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:08,160
Scott: "Recipient of the Grand Prix of the Academie Francaise, wind, sand, and stars captures the grandeur, danger, and isolation of flight.

658
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:19,157
Scott: Its exciting account of air adventure, combined with lyrical prose and the spirit of a philosopher, makes it one of the most popular works ever written about flying, translated by Louis

659
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:19,999
Scott: Galantier.".

660
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:32,300
Scott: Right, so, basically you have one of the most badass, literally was an adventuring pilot, closest thing to, I guess he was sort of like an Indiana Jones, but he didn't archaeology.

661
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,660
Scott: He piloted, you know, planes, mostly.

662
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
Scott: Real person, not a made up person.

663
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,600
Scott: You'd think this dude was, like, from Arcadia of my Youth or some shit, but this is real fucking life.

664
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:44,577
Scott: It was all true.

665
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:46,939
Scott: Like, Red Baron kind of shit.

666
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:48,738
Scott: And, so read this book.

667
00:33:49,686 --> 00:33:51,477
Scott: And also The Little Prince, which is what he's famous for.

668
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,790
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
