00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,198
Rym: It's Thursday, June 2nd, 2011.

2
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:12,660
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,281
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:14,665
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:21,217
Rym: Tonight at the game shows Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:32,022
Rym: Been biking to work every day as I say a lot at the beginning of the show, but I've run into some trouble Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:41,620
Rym: So I don't ride my real bike because due to my building's Union Shenanigan bullshit, I can't actually take it up into the building and there's no way.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,020
Rym: I'm parking my expensive bike out on the street in Midtown in the most bike steel in a city in the country.

9
00:00:47,642 --> 00:00:48,484
Scott: Yeah, my building.

10
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:52,357
Scott: between the hours of 8 and 6 I can ride the elevator with my bike.

11
00:00:52,397 --> 00:00:53,219
Scott: So I do yep.

12
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,636
Rym: So I ride my mountain bike and I park it outside and I tie it to the.

13
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:57,560
Rym: you know How?

14
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:58,403
Rym: there's municipal like.

15
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:02,338
Rym: you can just tie your bike to almost anything unless it's something that you obviously can't like.

16
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:05,188
Rym: you can't put it On the fence outside a subway station.

17
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,060
Scott: You can't tie it to the antenna on top of the Empire State Building.

18
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:09,044
Scott: It's out of reach.

19
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:14,507
Rym: Yeah, and it's a little too big but like if you put it around certain kinds of private property They're you know, you can't do that.

20
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:23,020
Rym: There's laws against that but there are Places you can guarantee to be able to do it for a bike rack the municipal bike racks and the municipal bike poles.

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:30,887
Rym: Yeah and one thing the city did a while ago and they're old but they're still there is on a lot of light poles at the Bottom is a little thing.

22
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:34,880
Rym: You can put your bike lock through and it has this bike logo on it and everything.

23
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:39,513
Rym: Yep, so there's a bunch of them right around my building one grand central place.

24
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,800
Rym: Yeah, aka the former Lincoln building.

25
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,398
Rym: so I parked my bike there outside.

26
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:49,240
Rym: and Every day these union assholes come out of the building and yell at me and threaten to cut my bike down.

27
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,213
Rym: They don't want me parking my bike anywhere near their building.

28
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:52,180
Scott: call police.

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,505
Rym: So what I did?

30
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:56,778
Rym: because the guy came out and actually threatened to cut my bike down one.

31
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,171
Rym: I took a picture of him which freaked him the fuck out and then I was like I'm gonna call the police right now if you threaten me again.

32
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,800
Scott: Yeah, what do you say to that?

33
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:05,490
Rym: Then he's like, come on blah blah blah.

34
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,073
Rym: It's my job.

35
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,280
Rym: I'm like, I don't care if my bike's gone.

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,067
Rym: I got a picture of you.

37
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:08,934
Rym: I've got a picture of the bike.

38
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:09,598
Rym: I'll call the police.

39
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,537
Rym: Yeah, if my bike is fucking and I and you know what my bike was still there.

40
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:14,300
Scott: That's right.

41
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:18,840
Rym: So I lodged a complaint with the city and I lodged a complaint with the building through my HR department.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,580
Rym: But I saw them over lunch today harassing some poor bike messenger who tied his bike to another municipal thing again next to the building.

43
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:30,211
Rym: So fuck those guys fuck those guys But I'll win this one.

44
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:31,160
Scott: that's that's the thing.

45
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,582
Scott: You know.

46
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:34,960
Rym: my bike seat is worth more than my bike and I carry the bike seat with me.

47
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,809
Rym: so if they actually do steal my bike, I Will go all out to fuck them.

48
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:45,111
Scott: Let's you know who did it and I'm not really out much Yeah, but yeah, it's in New York.

49
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:45,674
Scott: There's a lot of.

50
00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:49,940
Scott: there's a lot of rules and You know, the unions are very strong here.

51
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,900
Scott: But there are some rules that hold them back and hold various people back like taxis.

52
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,767
Scott: They have to take you somewhere.

53
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:59,340
Rym: However, I often pull bullshit to get anywhere out of the Javits.

54
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,026
Rym: This isn't the airport.

55
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:07,500
Rym: You basically have to lie and be like, yeah I'm going to the airport and we're just getting the cab be like actually no take me here And you got to be willing to call the police when they won't do it?

56
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:09,152
Scott: Oh, no, actually don't need to call the police.

57
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:10,220
Rym: You call that number in the cab.

58
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:15,180
Scott: Well, you call three one one, right in New York You can always call three one one if it's not nine one one.

59
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,528
Scott: But you still need to call something right.

60
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:18,560
Rym: the other thing the cabbies do mess with people.

61
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,100
Rym: They always quote unquote break their credit card machine.

62
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,340
Rym: They're like, ah, it's not working and then they freak out and attack you if you don't have or won't give them cash.

63
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:28,200
Scott: Yeah, so it's like you just got to fight for it.

64
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,954
Scott: Sometimes if you're not willing to fight for it, you're gonna lose out.

65
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:33,566
Rym: but the cool thing about Gotham Is that the laws are.

66
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,259
Rym: if you know what the laws are you do win in the end?

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,368
Scott: Yeah, so that they you know, and there's not.

68
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:38,871
Scott: you know, there's.

69
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:41,664
Scott: of course it's impossible to know all the laws Yeah, but there are.

70
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:44,233
Scott: but there's plenty of laws that you can learn.

71
00:03:44,273 --> 00:03:47,162
Scott: that are the ones that matter for everyday Geekery.

72
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,512
Rym: if you're an anime geek, you know about your anime.

73
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:51,480
Rym: if you're a I don't know hentai geek.

74
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,790
Rym: You know about the laws related to hentai in your jurisdiction.

75
00:03:55,312 --> 00:03:57,960
Rym: So if you're a biker, don't give me that jurors my addiction.

76
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,480
Rym: I think there's a hentai about jurors in your dick.

77
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:06,840
Rym: Anyway, so if you're a biker you got to know pretty much like you should be an expert on the bike laws.

78
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:12,854
Rym: Yeah in your town if you'd have a car and you own it in Manhattan You'd better damn well know where you can park.

79
00:04:12,874 --> 00:04:13,498
Rym: cuz I don't know.

80
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:17,880
Scott: So anyway, I was speaking of biking yesterday.

81
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:23,987
Rym: Oh, and I saw a guy riding a bike over the Queensborough Bridge on my way home And he was carrying another larger bike over his back.

82
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:24,689
Scott: Nice.

83
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:33,100
Scott: I was biking to work yesterday, right and There's like there's a crowd of people standing around and a guy laying on the ground.

84
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,884
Scott: So I'm like up.

85
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:35,514
Scott: is this guy having trouble?

86
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:36,500
Scott: What's wrong with this guy?

87
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:45,458
Scott: All right, so I stopped to check out and see what's wrong with this guy and I don't know He might have had a heat stroke or a very minor heart attack or who knows what right?

88
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,131
Scott: He's complaining of chest pain couldn't breathe, you know, whatever.

89
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:50,472
Scott: Yep.

90
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,960
Scott: So some people calling on one one.

91
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:59,380
Scott: I'm standing around thinking I know CPR and if he stops breathing, you know, I'll help him out.

92
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:06,000
Scott: Plus I had read recently just supposed to do chest compressions and forget the whole mouth thing and then they have a better chance of survival.

93
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:07,024
Scott: So I was like up.

94
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,109
Scott: Well, we'll see what happens.

95
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,399
Scott: Yeah, so I'm waiting there and his people around And then one guy's like I gotta go to work.

96
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:17,339
Scott: You know the guys like I'm gonna go down and talk to the traffic cop at the end of the bridge.

97
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:20,571
Scott: Another guy so suddenly just me and this guy.

98
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:21,976
Scott: basically we're New Yorkers.

99
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:26,090
Rym: We get bored quickly Like anything crazy is happening.

100
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,705
Rym: everybody stops for like a second like whoa Okay, I gotta get to work.

101
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:33,200
Scott: All right, so basically I'm standing with this guy and he's you know, he's recovering.

102
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,828
Scott: He didn't he didn't die or need CPR, right?

103
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:39,560
Scott: He was just probably heat-stroked and extremely exhausted.

104
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:41,280
Scott: Right and he recovered.

105
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:50,040
Scott: but I was basically standing there waiting for an ambulance to show up on the pedestrian part of the bridge for like over a half hour and It never showed lesson.

106
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:54,959
Scott: Don't hurt yourself on the pedestrian part of the bridge because the ambulance will not get there.

107
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,582
Scott: You know what?

108
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:59,520
Rym: I'm very alone with the ambulance driving on the pedestrian part of that bridge to get to you.

109
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,193
Scott: It didn't even but it didn't even like show that we didn't hear a siren nothing.

110
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:10,692
Scott: There was no no no cops No, no, no one tried to come even though 911 was called Almost like 45 minutes to an hour.

111
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:11,960
Scott: I left before it showed up.

112
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,660
Rym: I think the moral there is don't ever need an ambulance.

113
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:20,088
Scott: But I mean, it's like, you know, I guess it was the morning rush hour Who knows but it never it.

114
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,979
Scott: I had to leave before it showed up But the guy was able to recover and walk down because to the end of the bridge yesterday

115
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:32,872
Rym: I was walking to lunch and an old guy just like like he was walking in front of me and he just like fell Yeah on nothing and he was fine.

116
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,998
Rym: I helped him up and he was.

117
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,420
Scott: he tripped.

118
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,840
Rym: He didn't like no there was nothing to trip on walking and he didn't trip.

119
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:43,952
Rym: It wasn't like his foot like went and then he thought it was but it was a fall It wasn't an aneurysm or he just felt a stroke.

120
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:45,256
Rym: He fell straight down.

121
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:46,039
Rym: All right, like.

122
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:50,473
Rym: Then he got up and I was like you okay, and he's like leave me alone.

123
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,811
Rym: And then I just like a fading goat Yeah, he didn't even faint just kind of like fell.

124
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,025
Scott: All right, it was kind of I don't know Maybe it was a very minor seizure.

125
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,255
Rym: and also today I saw a dude who was biking.

126
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:02,620
Rym: Yep, and he just fell.

127
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:04,346
Rym: Yeah, like he didn't hit anything.

128
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:07,840
Rym: He was like riding and then his front he just like wobble falls over.

129
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,385
Rym: Yeah All right.

130
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:11,392
Rym: I don't know what happened there.

131
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:15,929
Rym: He was like he was young Reasonably fit on a normal bike bike was fine.

132
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,514
Rym: I don't know what his deal was, but he just fell.

133
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:18,337
Scott: that happens.

134
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:20,327
Scott: Yeah All right.

135
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:24,631
Rym: All right, so There's some irony in my news today.

136
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:25,556
Rym: It's this Thursday.

137
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:26,340
Rym: It's the lounge.

138
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,800
Rym: So The irony I'll get to in a second.

139
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,089
Rym: But here's an article pointing out that phone books are actually still a pretty big problem because people keep delivering them Despite the fact that no one uses them.

140
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,017
Scott: No one uses what phone books.

141
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:40,720
Scott: That's true.

142
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,164
Rym: Yes, now the cool thing is I?

143
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:45,173
Rym: well, I forgot that there's two kinds of phone books.

144
00:07:45,193 --> 00:07:47,600
Rym: There's the yellow pages and the white pages.

145
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,800
Rym: So apparently no one uses the white pages like no one.

146
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:54,487
Scott: That's right.

147
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,660
Rym: and the yellow pages?

148
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:57,326
Rym: Well, basically here's the deal.

149
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:01,119
Rym: the article is talking about how the phone book delivery system is finally coming down.

150
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:03,586
Rym: Books are finally starting to disappear.

151
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:06,655
Rym: check out this obsolete antiquated shit finally going away.

152
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:09,957
Rym: Yeah, you know who's reporting that USA today?

153
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:19,355
Rym: Yeah, but some gems from this article because I didn't really I better.

154
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:21,000
Scott: I better report on this.

155
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,051
Scott: You know these newfangled iPods.

156
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:26,540
Scott: here it the news reports coming over the ticker.

157
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:33,080
Scott: Apparently People are getting music in some sort of digital format.

158
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:39,419
Rym: So apparently get this the people who are really pushing for this because apparently took legislation to bring this stupid industry down.

159
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:40,222
Scott: Oh, thank god.

160
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:42,229
Rym: So a quote from the article.

161
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:50,600
Rym: There's a guy who's works for the product Stewardship Institute Which is a nonprofit whose sole goal is to limit the environmental impact of consumer products.

162
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:55,020
Rym: All right, he basically said we all know if you were in fever people to use the phone book every year.

163
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:57,090
Rym: It's an antiquated antiquated industry.

164
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:57,714
Rym: We should get rid of it.

165
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:13,791
Rym: and Basically some laws were passed in Seattle Yeah Seattle saying that people should be allowed to opt out of the delivery of any phone book yellow or white Simple law that people should have the right to opt out.

166
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:14,575
Rym: Yep.

167
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:15,880
Rym: A similar law was passed.

168
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,548
Scott: What's the penalty for giving someone a phone book who opted out?

169
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:19,150
Rym: I don't know.

170
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:20,153
Scott: Is there penalty?

171
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:20,735
Rym: Yes.

172
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,139
Rym: I'm as I assume so, okay.

173
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:30,138
Rym: So San Francisco passed a similar law and The phone book companies the private company lost their tribute.

174
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:38,500
Rym: them Filed lawsuits against these laws saying there's a violation of free speech to allow people to opt out of receiving their phone books.

175
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:42,626
Rym: Okay So think about this.

176
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:46,400
Rym: how whenever has an industry in one stroke?

177
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,440
Rym: Both fought against its demise and proved why it needs to go away in a single sentence.

178
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:56,366
Scott: But I mean, okay, so if you say it's free speech Let's say they win.

179
00:09:56,547 --> 00:09:58,860
Scott: It's free speech - for the phone book, right?

180
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,918
Scott: You can't opt out of it.

181
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:05,160
Scott: That means I can drop anything on everyone's porch no matter what even if they have a sign.

182
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,273
Scott: This is no soliciting or don't leave your menus here it.

183
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:10,782
Scott: that means it's legal for me to drop anything I want.

184
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:15,537
Scott: that is speech on anyone's doorstep and they're not allowed to say no forget that.

185
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:16,460
Rym: let's go a little closer.

186
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,887
Scott: I'm gonna go and make something some sort of art.

187
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,756
Scott: It's an artistic piece of dog poop, right?

188
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:21,936
Scott: It's.

189
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:23,120
Scott: it's a dog poop sculpture.

190
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,525
Scott: It's it's speech.

191
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:28,360
Scott: It's art and I'm gonna leave it on everyone's doorstep because that's part of the artistic message.

192
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,674
Rym: Simpler argument.

193
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:39,919
Rym: All right They're saying that they want the right to deliver phone books to people who don't want them so badly That they will file paperwork to make sure they don't get them.

194
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:44,499
Rym: Now clearly the people who get them who don't want them are not going to open them.

195
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:52,660
Rym: So this industry is Proving that all it is doing is using its fake circulation numbers to trick people who don't know better to buying ads.

196
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,479
Scott: It's all advertising is the same way.

197
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:58,460
Rym: So that's pretty much it.

198
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:06,380
Rym: I just thought it was interesting And I thought that the fact that the phone book companies are suing for the right to foist their garbage upon people is kind of amazing.

199
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:09,728
Scott: Nothing surprised me anymore.

200
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:11,477
Scott: I've been seeing the same thing for 15 years.

201
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:24,158
Rym: Remember every year they would bring the phone books on a big pallet and put him in Gracie's and anyone who wanted a phone book would just take him and Pretty much no one took him and they all went into the dumpster.

202
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:28,435
Scott: I mean, this is yet another one of those things where it's like it took this long.

203
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:29,640
Scott: It's like I could have you know.

204
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:36,703
Scott: So behind the times this should have been done in like 1997 not 2012 Mm-hmm.

205
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,288
Scott: The thing is the.

206
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,322
Rym: there's a quote from the article to from the industry itself saying that they believe they don't Believe.

207
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:47,989
Rym: they say that seventy five percent of people Actively use the yellow pages and I call bullshit on that.

208
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:48,972
Scott: That's absolutely bullshit.

209
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,680
Rym: There's no way I have not used a yellow page.

210
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,100
Scott: Okay, someone who buys in yellow pages ad should sue them for false advertise.

211
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,053
Rym: I can't imagine the last time I used a yellow pages for anything.

212
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:01,000
Scott: I think I used it in Beacon once.

213
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,665
Rym: Yeah, I did.

214
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:04,547
Rym: I looked up.

215
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:05,630
Rym: I was looking for what.

216
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,535
Rym: was it a plumber or something?

217
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:17,999
Rym: So once in ten years Plus I Decided a long time ago and I've stuck to this Unless I walk past a place or I specifically know about it due to some other means.

218
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:22,756
Rym: Pretty much no one who doesn't have a website is ever gonna get business for me ever.

219
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:23,519
Scott: That's pretty much it.

220
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:29,891
Scott: So yeah, the biggest news of today Was YouTube adding creative common support right now.

221
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:31,898
Scott: This is you know, it's like well, what's the big deal?

222
00:12:31,938 --> 00:13:01,460
Scott: Well Flickr has always had creative common support and the way flickers stuff worked was that you could go and mark your photos With a creative commons license any creative commons license you desired and then it would clearly display on your photo What license it had and would also put the appropriate metadata in the HTML so someone could programmatically Determine, you know, which flicker photos were licensed with which you know restrictions and whatnot in which terms which you know.

223
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,932
Scott: YouTube has now added that and I'm like good god.

224
00:13:03,972 --> 00:13:08,310
Scott: It's like you flicker had that Decade ago, why isn't YouTube had that?

225
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:09,858
Scott: but they finally have it.

226
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,270
Scott: but What they've added is pretty much just one license.

227
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,474
Scott: It's the same license.

228
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,039
Scott: We have attribution only which is great.

229
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:19,216
Scott: Because I really don't you know, there's a reason I picked that one.

230
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:34,767
Scott: Yeah And would also be kind of difficult for them to add the no commercial license because then YouTube couldn't put an ad on your video And it would be a little difficult for them to do, you know, the share alike license, you know, because it's like well Would

231
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:37,059
Rym: be really easy for them to do it because there's nothing for them to do.

232
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,740
Scott: Well the point I think that other thing is that they wanted to keep it simple for the user.

233
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,932
Scott: Yeah, you know, they why it's just creative commons or not?

234
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:45,293
Scott: right?

235
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:47,200
Scott: not pick a license, duh?

236
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,932
Rym: Well, I also like think about this the subtle it.

237
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:57,483
Rym: by using this as the intelligent default It just people who don't know better will end up giving up more rights They would have.

238
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:02,080
Scott: they'll use the most permissive best license the one that everyone should use for almost everything.

239
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:02,286
Scott: Anyway.

240
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:07,737
Scott: But so that's you know, they added basically the same thing that flicker has kinda.

241
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:09,705
Scott: so it's like, okay Well, what's so exciting about that?

242
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:11,713
Scott: What's exciting is the other feature they have added.

243
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:19,186
Scott: if you don't know this There's actually a sort of mediocre video editor built into YouTube right like.

244
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:28,980
Scott: you can edit videos right in your web browser and This video editor now searches through YouTube for all the creative commons license videos Right and allows you to edit them together.

245
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:35,574
Scott: And if you're looking if you're watching a video that is creative commons license You can click a button to start editing it right away right in the browser.

246
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,040
Rym: So, you know, what's gonna happen here?

247
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,652
Rym: See, yes, I think you know what's gonna happen here a creative explosion.

248
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:49,344
Scott: I know what flicker really needs to do right is They need to make it so that when you click on a photo that's creative commons license as an in-browser Photoshop.

249
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:50,671
Scott: kind of situation going on.

250
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:52,420
Scott: That would be pretty awesome.

251
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:58,220
Rym: Well, something's got to happen because I'm not paying for any more Adobe Premiere after the version I've got now.

252
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,780
Rym: Yeah, and it it amazes me that premiere to this day cannot deal with a vast majority of formats of video out there.

253
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:06,844
Scott: I know right.

254
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:14,799
Scott: It's like it was funny because today we got an intern at work And he had an Ubuntu machine and he was like the video player was like install a codec.

255
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:16,378
Scott: Yes No, and I was like, oh, that's right.

256
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:23,374
Scott: like Ubuntu the open source stuff just Automatically gets any codec in the universe for every kind of video and plays it all perfectly.

257
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:26,840
Scott: and it's only on Windows and Mac That you need to go get some other video.

258
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,250
Rym: Also weird codec packs are the worst Adobe that you know.

259
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,514
Rym: people always excuse them.

260
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:38,640
Rym: Adobe themselves usually say things like oh well It's for professionals not amateurs and professionals only use X format and Y form.

261
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,603
Scott: It's like the commercial software is the one that's missing all the codecs and all the features in the open source software as every codec In the universe.

262
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:53,760
Rym: the other argument they'll make is that oh well format X or container Y is not suited to Frame by frame editing to which my answer is so why don't you just have it important convert?

263
00:15:54,742 --> 00:15:57,440
Scott: Because that would be more work for them and it wouldn't sell them any more copies.

264
00:15:57,763 --> 00:15:59,239
Scott: Yeah, that's what you always say.

265
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:00,164
Scott: They would.

266
00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:02,132
Scott: they sell it if they added MKV support.

267
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:03,880
Scott: how many more copies of premiere would that sell them?

268
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,019
Rym: I know I know that's why I have premiere now because it's still better than any open source thing there is.

269
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:15,500
Rym: But that's not gonna be the case forever and I just got a hold out on this shit ass version of premiere.

270
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:27,738
Scott: Until the open source world is good enough for me to edit together videos of Rainbow Dash What happens right is they wouldn't sell any more copies or premiere But someone else has a business selling a premiere plug-in that makes MKV's work.

271
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,528
Rym: Oh good So we were sorry.

272
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,500
Scott: premiere added that feature.

273
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:35,380
Scott: All they would do is put that other company out of business, but they wouldn't make any more money for themselves.

274
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:37,719
Rym: You know what really grinds my gears.

275
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,100
Rym: Yeah that but let's zoom out because a better example that people are more familiar with is Twitter.

276
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,176
Rym: Twitter has a thing people might use it.

277
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:46,840
Rym: It's called Twitter.

278
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:51,900
Rym: You can tweet and there's an API that lets you do cool stuff that Twitter doesn't do by default.

279
00:16:52,505 --> 00:17:07,560
Rym: So a lot of people built whole Businesses around providing little features that Twitter didn't provide and then Twitter then provides those features and those people are now mad Claiming that Twitter is unfairly competing with them or driving them out of business or somehow tricked them.

280
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,507
Scott: This isn't really your.

281
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:12,640
Rym: their dumb ass is for even thinking that that was a viable business model.

282
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,880
Scott: Yeah, this is an old old story in the software world, right?

283
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,451
Scott: I mean, I think the best example is Visual Studio.

284
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:21,907
Scott: right Visual Studio as many versions I mean.

285
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:28,280
Scott: when I was in high school We were using Visual Studio like five and now they're on Visual Studio 2011 or 2010 or who knows what right?

286
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,120
Rym: I installed the newest free version on my computer at work and I really like it anyway.

287
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:36,580
Scott: But the point is is that Visual Studio has lots of plugins for all sorts of shit, right?

288
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:56,846
Scott: Cuz it has to integrate with all sorts of different development things, you know, if you're developing some particular thing Well, you know instead of say, you know Writing your own development environment You just make a Visual Studio plug-in so that people can then use Visual Studio to develop software for whatever your weird platform is right and there's tons and tons of plugins out there.

289
00:17:56,906 --> 00:18:08,139
Scott: and this whole business is that survived by making Visual Studio plugins and doing things that Visual Studio doesn't do and Occasionally as you can imagine over many many years 10 plus years of Visual Studio, maybe even 15 years.

290
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:08,917
Scott: I don't know It's really old.

291
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:19,106
Scott: they've added a lot of features to Visual Studio that have made a lot of those plugins useless and made basically a lot of those companies that make those plugins Not need to exist anymore.

292
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:20,230
Scott: And it's just a reality.

293
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,459
Rym: This is what happens and nothing of value was lost.

294
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,028
Scott: Yeah This is what happens when you build a business Based on someone else's business.

295
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:31,360
Scott: that business that is underneath you can owns you right?

296
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:43,240
Scott: It's like if I made an accessory for Ford cars and then Ford change the design of their cars so that my accessory doesn't work Anymore or they provide that feature in the car already so that my accessory is no longer necessary.

297
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,240
Scott: Well, I basically my business depended on Ford.

298
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:54,000
Scott: So am I pretty much my hopes are Ford buys me and I become part of Ford and or they ignore me.

299
00:18:54,562 --> 00:18:58,655
Scott: You know, I'm basically putting a whole bunch of risk because this other company.

300
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:00,442
Scott: I'm dependent on them You.

301
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:04,700
Scott: if you want to have a long-term business, you need to be dependent on nobody but yourself.

302
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:07,080
Rym: Well and the general economy?

303
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:09,440
Scott: Yeah, of course, that's but that's true with any business.

304
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,020
Scott: But you know, it's especially true in software where a lot of things are plugins.

305
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:15,160
Scott: I mean even making something simple, right?

306
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:21,960
Scott: Like if you make a video game and you use DirectX and you make you make a Windows video game, right?

307
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,702
Scott: Using DirectX.

308
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:28,900
Scott: Well, guess what Microsoft owns you if they decide to just discontinue DirectX or remove it from Windows or Who know?

309
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,895
Rym: The same time they go?

310
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:31,540
Scott: it's unlikely.

311
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:35,223
Rym: I'm saying that's not a great example because that's more like using Like.

312
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:39,080
Rym: that's a platform for developing and you understand the consequences of the platform these people.

313
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:42,680
Scott: I'm saying it's obviously that is a low-risk a very low-risk situation, right?

314
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,485
Scott: But the point is you are still.

315
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:48,359
Scott: there is an extremely tiny but existing risk that you are dependent on.

316
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:52,492
Rym: Microsoft Congress is gonna make your entire industry illegal.

317
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:57,808
Scott: That's also always true Right, but the you know, you ought to reduce those risks.

318
00:19:57,828 --> 00:20:00,495
Scott: so don't build something that like.

319
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:04,780
Scott: if you're making a website using You know, it's okay to integrate with Facebook, right?

320
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:12,664
Scott: But you probably don't want Facebook connect being your only means of logging in because then Facebook can totally owns your company basically Indirectly.

321
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:14,351
Scott: you need to also have your own logging in.

322
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:18,284
Scott: in case Facebook connect dicks you over You can just drop them and your website will still work.

323
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:28,060
Rym: So speaking of dicks is time for things of the day.

324
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:32,579
Rym: So I was trying to think oh, wow, that's actually really relevant to your thing of the day.

325
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,800
Scott: Intentionally, I was trying to think of a classic thing of the day, right?

326
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,242
Scott: Cuz I couldn't.

327
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,878
Scott: there have been any new things of the day that aren't College Humor.

328
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:40,260
Scott: lately.

329
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:41,948
Rym: We've got College Humor's down right now.

330
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:44,240
Scott: Is it really because it worked for me a few minutes ago?

331
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:45,264
Rym: Maybe it just came back out.

332
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:49,140
Rym: We've got some old classics that we've already done like here born to be alive.

333
00:20:49,301 --> 00:21:02,399
Scott: yeah, I tried to go and look up some classics and figure out if we hadn't done them like Kakugo Jui Chi or push a robot shovel robot secret of space or You know, have we done all your base or belong to us?

334
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:03,404
Scott: Right?

335
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:05,380
Scott: and it was like we've done all those things in the day, right?

336
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,847
Scott: I couldn't find any things of the day.

337
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:13,296
Scott: We haven't used except for one I think and I realized Oh, this is something that is sort of an inside joke and we always bring it up.

338
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,409
Scott: It's horrible It's in the show.

339
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:16,760
Scott: We bring it up all the time.

340
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,460
Scott: This is one of those people probably don't know what the hell we're talking to.

341
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:31,080
Rym: You've probably heard us on the show say It's a little bit more obscure than it's goofy time, right?

342
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,665
Scott: So it's like, you know, we say that the dragon does all the time But I don't think most.

343
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:39,360
Scott: I think pretty sure most people have no idea what we're referring even in our crew.

344
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,550
Rym: About half the crew either don't know what we're talking about.

345
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:48,950
Rym: a few of them know vaguely what we're talking about in that They know it's a horrifying thing that they don't actually want to see.

346
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,551
Scott: All right.

347
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:52,400
Scott: Well if you are curious, here's the YouTube video.

348
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:55,332
Scott: We're gonna reveal the inside joke my year.

349
00:21:55,352 --> 00:21:59,457
Scott: This is what happened during with the dragon.

350
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:02,107
Scott: and What what the dragon does.

351
00:22:02,127 --> 00:22:03,313
Rym: I'm the dragon.

352
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,840
Rym: this I have made it.

353
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,732
Rym: I just didn't finish it yet, but I'm mashing that up with spike in my little pony.

354
00:22:08,932 --> 00:22:09,273
Rym: Nice.

355
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:10,537
Scott: That's horrible.

356
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:11,420
Scott: That's the greatest.

357
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:13,125
Rym: There's one deeper.

358
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,268
Rym: It's like goofy.

359
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:18,480
Rym: time is like this level and then under that is the dragon the year.

360
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,098
Rym: You know what's under that?

361
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:24,745
Scott: Which the Basically there's.

362
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:26,739
Scott: this is not a thing of the day because we can't actually find it.

363
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,980
Rym: I don't think it's on the internet ride and to my credit trying to find that is a trying process.

364
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,860
Rym: There was like the things you see in Google.

365
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:42,960
Scott: There was a really really shitty flash animation that was poorly drawn in MS Paint by like a teenager.

366
00:22:43,081 --> 00:22:45,220
Rym: But it started out, you know back when flash animations.

367
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:51,612
Rym: It was basically just the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme with some kind of mediocre from the year 2000 of they of it.

368
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:54,023
Rym: and it starts out benign like okay This is lame.

369
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:57,840
Rym: and then little penises like pop up like for a second.

370
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,084
Rym: You're like was that a penis?

371
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:06,870
Rym: and you're not sure and then it just goes full tilt from there like Michelangelo Is a party dude and we can't.

372
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,913
Scott: there's a flash animation.

373
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,659
Scott: That's this horrifying Ninja Turtles.

374
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,744

Scott: Yeah, does it?

381
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:25,660
Scott: so that's not a thing of the day because he can't find it.

382
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,540
Rym: But if you find it, you'll get a free GeekNights t-shirt.

383
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:31,114
Scott: My year with the dragon is a thing of the day.

384
00:23:31,255 --> 00:23:32,160
Scott: and what's rims thing of the day?

385
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,962
Rym: My thing of the day is Emily works with and knows a lot of talented people and she went to the NYU School of Film and Animation.

386
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:42,700
Rym: so what I have for you and it's a link to our forum post that has three of them in a row.

387
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:50,700
Rym: Three of her co-workers have three of their animation theses from SVA And they're pretty goddamn bad ass.

388
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:58,540
Scott: If you don't know SVA is the School of Visual Arts in New York City and basically everyone who goes there is like the best Artist in the world school for visual awesome.

389
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:03,480
Scott: Yeah, pretty much you go to like mocha festival and there's like just like a row of SVA students and it's like how do you?

390
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,327
Scott: What are they teaching you at this school?

391
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,635
Scott: I have no art skills.

392
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,088
Scott: if I went to this school Would I suddenly be like Van Gogh?

393
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,836
Scott: I don't know how this shit works.

394
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,425
Rym: I have a feeling It's like RIT.

395
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:17,220
Rym: if you don't already know how to code when you get to RIT You're not coming out knowing how to code.

396
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:19,086
Scott: Yeah But SVA is some kind of magic.

397
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,853
Scott: everyone who goes there is the best artist ever.

398
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:25,012
Rym: Naomi George and Eugene Made three videos three animations.

399
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:25,676
Rym: They're pretty great.

400
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:26,480
Rym: I'm linking to them.

401
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:29,519
Scott: How could they if they were you just tell me it doesn't matter who they are.

402
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:31,549
Scott: So and so what school they go to SVA?

403
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:33,919
Scott: Yeah, I want to see whatever art they did because it's the best.

404
00:24:34,861 --> 00:24:37,680
Scott: So of course in the meta unless they failed out we're talking about people great.

405
00:24:38,282 --> 00:24:40,108
Scott: I'm sure they're horrible artists who fail out.

406
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:42,296
Scott: Maybe that's their trick is they just kill everyone.

407
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,199
Scott: Yeah, who's bad?

408
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:45,507
Scott: Just maintain the reputation.

409
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:49,360
Rym: So the book club book is still Isaac Asimov's foundation.

410
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,811
Rym: We'll do the show on it at some point.

411
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:58,880
Rym: the unofficial book Book is the entirety of the Prince of Nothing series by our Scott backer because we're gonna do more shows on it.

412
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,696
Rym: Yeah, that deserves a set of dedicated shows that we could almost make.

413
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:03,520
Rym: that will be pod.

414
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,426
Scott: We'll be doing shows on it for years.

415
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:08,074
Rym: Yeah, it's a perennial favorite.

416
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:09,499
Rym: I don't know what else.

417
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:12,380
Scott: I should say It's like it's the front row crew book, right?

418
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:18,251
Scott: It's not that it's not the best fantasy book ever but it's great and it's it, you know, it has special meaning for listeners

419
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:26,200
Rym: are proving my expectations right because about every month or so Someone will post in the forum or email us and be like, I finally read that fucking our Scott backer book.

420
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,124
Rym: Why'd I wait this long?

421
00:25:27,164 --> 00:25:27,928
Rym: Jesus Christ?

422
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:28,309
Scott: Yeah.

423
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,836
Rym: Oh man when ne'er died.

424
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:39,520
Scott: Yeah Everyone's favorite scene lately is is With it with the Emperor being like yeah your guards are outside mine.

425
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,559
Rym: Oh, that is one of my favorite scenes, too.

426
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,038
Rym: That was an any kiss the Emperor's ring when I read that scene when I first read the book That was the moment when I stopped and went.

427
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,725
Scott: Hells yeah, cuz like they play.

428
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:55,300
Scott: play the Emperor like he's a crazy, you know, almost like, you know nutty inbred Roman guy.

429
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:59,440
Scott: But then it's like oh, there's a reason he's still the Emperor and not dead already.

430
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:04,346
Scott: He's more like with this.

431
00:26:04,447 --> 00:26:05,773
Scott: he's more like a Stalin.

432
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:07,300
Rym: only should I stack.

433
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,300
Scott: It's more like a Stalin in the paranoia sense and not in the killing everybody's or in the chest.

434
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:15,108
Rym: I don't think I could behead him the ceremonial sword.

435
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:15,931
Rym: Isn't that sharp?

436
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:20,146
Rym: Oh Man that's some good stuff.

437
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:22,420
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX not prices conference.

438
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:28,300
Rym: Probably a PAX dev Connecticut will be at not at Otakon, but that's their call not ours.

439
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:31,263
Scott: Anyway That's enough.

440
00:26:31,504 --> 00:26:33,512
Scott: Oh, let's talk about e-commerce right ram.

441
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:35,300
Scott: Have you sent t-shirts to everyone who's supposed to get them?

442
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,827
Rym: They're going out actually this week.

443
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:37,631
Rym: Uh-huh.

444
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:38,535
Scott: You're a little slow there.

445
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:39,319
Rym: I am a little slow.

446
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:41,268
Scott: Did you get the international shipping work?

447
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:43,880
Rym: Oh, I have two people who request international orders.

448
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:54,540
Rym: I tested with one of them to see if it would work and it looks like it'll work Alright, so all the people all the people have already posted in the forum or emailed me about international orders.

449
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:59,420
Rym: Those should go out by Saturday and you'll get an invoice from Google checkout.

450
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,340
Scott: So if somebody can it so can somebody just go to the shop front recruit calm and buy something internationally.

451
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,608
Rym: Well, you want an international shipping of a t-shirt.

452
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:08,551
Rym: You have to email me.

453
00:27:09,173 --> 00:27:10,618
Scott: Rym at front recruit calm.

454
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:14,873
Scott: Yep I'll maybe I'll make shop at front recruit calm and make it point to you.

455
00:27:15,073 --> 00:27:16,700
Rym: Yeah, we might have already done something like that.

456
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,851
Rym: I forget what we did with the shot.

457
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:18,618
Rym: I got a look in the head.

458
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:26,560
Rym: Anyway, so anyone who has a t-shirt order pending if you don't receive it with within about a week of today then something went wrong.

459
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:30,915
Scott: Yeah, and then as soon as the merch runs out, we're gonna have about three of them left.

460
00:27:30,955 --> 00:27:32,842
Rym: after I ship the outstanding order We'll get.

461
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:33,746
Scott: we'll get new merch.

462
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:34,489
Rym: We got some.

463
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:35,875
Scott: we'll make it a higher priority.

464
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:37,120
Rym: Maybe we should make it dragon.

465
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,924
Rym: Let's do it.

466
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:41,660
Scott: Maybe we could do it in time for not ConnectiCon but PAX West.

467
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:46,296
Rym: Ah, actually what I want to do for the next PAX East is make GeekNights trading cards.

468
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:47,039
Scott: We could do that.

469
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:49,434
Scott: Good getting with all the other trading card people.

470
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:51,625
Rym: Yeah our buttons I don't know both.

471
00:27:51,846 --> 00:27:56,566
Rym: we can make some buttons for prime we but we always say we'll do that and someone else did it for Us and then it's a month before the car.

472
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:57,391
Scott: some awesome people.

473
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,898
Rym: I know cuz we're not awesome enough.

474
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:03,579
Rym: every year I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna make buttons and then it's a week before packs and I'm like, oh right buttons.

475
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,068
Scott: Yeah, anyway, that's enough meta.

476
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:06,812
Scott: That's enough.

477
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:16,884
Scott: So game shows Alright, so this status feels like a show we've done before but I extensively searched the archives for a show about TV game shows And I did not find one.

478
00:28:17,426 --> 00:28:18,631
Scott: if this is a repeat.

479
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:19,515
Scott: I'm sorry.

480
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:20,880
Scott: Call me out and you are right.

481
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:23,252
Rym: No, because they people have been requesting repeats.

482
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:24,860
Rym: We've been planning to do this for a while.

483
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,603
Rym: We just haven't bought.

484
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:28,535
Scott: but the thing doesn't matter cuz I'm pretty sure it's not a repeat like 99% sure cuz.

485
00:28:28,555 --> 00:28:30,441
Scott: I searched Extensively.

486
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:31,324
Rym: but one last meta.

487
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:39,490
Rym: something we were planning to do at some point is go take a particular random old episode of GeekNights From like - nothing you were planning to do not me.

488
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,317
Rym: the listeners want it and I want it.

489
00:28:41,358 --> 00:28:41,900
Rym: I think it'd be cool.

490
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:43,991
Scott: Yeah, you always want this weird to take a top.

491
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:54,639
Rym: take a show we did in like 2005 2006 right take the exact same topic Record it again and then you know, listen to the old show and see if our opinions have changed.

492
00:28:55,162 --> 00:28:55,604
Scott: Probably.

493
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:57,393
Scott: yeah find any show.

494
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:57,694
Scott: We're like.

495
00:28:57,714 --> 00:29:02,262
Scott: PC gaming is dead Nintendo.

496
00:29:02,563 --> 00:29:03,125
Rym: I disagree.

497
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:05,793
Rym: we weren't wrong then because then PC gaming was dead.

498
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:08,080
Rym: I'm just saying it is having a renaissance.

499
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:10,660
Rym: I'm just saying which we did not say could not happen.

500
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:12,380
Rym: I'm just saying but I digress now.

501
00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:17,660
Rym: We argued at length before recording this whether or not this was a Tuesday or a Thursday show.

502
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:20,591
Rym: The reasons why we were doing it on Thursday are one.

503
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,318
Rym: We needed a Thursday show.

504
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:23,763
Scott: That's right Number.

505
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:24,806
Scott: that's the number one reason.

506
00:29:24,906 --> 00:29:25,388
Rym: I have some.

507
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:26,732
Rym: that's the number one answer.

508
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:29,160
Rym: I have some post-hoc reasons.

509
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:42,767
Rym: If we were going to do a show on game shows, that was a Tuesday We'd talk more about the mechanics of the shows and the strategy and individual shows in great mechanical detail Mm-hmm, but we're not talking about that.

510
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:46,660
Rym: We're talking about them as television shows as entertainment as us at home watching.

511
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:47,445
Scott: That's a post-hoc.

512
00:29:47,505 --> 00:29:48,310
Scott: Excuse the real it's.

513
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,920
Scott: the real reason is we need Thursday shows.

514
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,529
Rym: I did not say it was not a post-hoc excuse.

515
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:54,576
Rym: In fact, I already had that disclaimer there.

516
00:29:54,797 --> 00:29:58,389
Rym: I'm just saying me I'm the king of post-hoc trash talk.

517
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,092
Scott: That is right.

518
00:29:59,313 --> 00:30:05,694
Scott: So you're you're in fact not the king of No, you're the god of post-hoc trash talk.

519
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:06,055
Scott: you go down.

520
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:07,340
Scott: it's like Thor lightning.

521
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:09,866
Scott: Mm-hmm Rym.

522
00:30:09,886 --> 00:30:11,119
Scott: post-hoc trash talk.

523
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,445
Scott: Scott giant penises.

524
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:13,747
Rym: Okay.

525
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:16,960
Rym: It's very rare that I will say I'm gonna win this game before the game.

526
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:22,246
Rym: I rarely will pull the Babe Ruth and point out over the outfield After the game's over.

527
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:22,708
Rym: I'll be like.

528
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:24,156
Rym: I knew I was gonna win the whole time.

529
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:24,980
Scott: That's right.

530
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:27,375
Scott: Anyway, so so TV game shows.

531
00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:28,180
Scott: it's weird.

532
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:31,086
Scott: We were when we were preparing for this show Which we spent about five minutes on.

533
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:38,535
Rym: we went to Wikipedia and found a list of TV game shows And I right-clicked on every one that I watched and I clicked on like 30 game show.

534
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:39,779
Scott: I couldn't figure out it's like.

535
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:44,216
Scott: I didn't Realize it until now just like how much I liked TV game shows.

536
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:46,545
Scott: when I watch TV It's like I didn't like.

537
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:53,689
Scott: I didn't realize that was actually sort of a moderate to major Geekery of mine because I didn't even it was just.

538
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,234
Scott: it's just sort of like always there.

539
00:30:55,294 --> 00:31:00,133
Scott: the same way that like when I was A kid Disney afternoon was like always there and I wasn't like.

540
00:31:00,153 --> 00:31:06,871
Scott: you asked me if I was a big fan of it I would have been like no, it's just the thing I Every goddamn day it was on.

541
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:08,140
Scott: yeah, so it's like game shows.

542
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,260
Scott: I realized just now just within the past hour that they're one of those things that I just sort of always watched.

543
00:31:13,703 --> 00:31:15,500
Scott: Never felt like I was a big fan.

544
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:22,260
Scott: I've never you know Expressed never wore t-shirts about them or bought merch for them or anything like that to be on them desperately.

545
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:24,893
Scott: Oh, yeah, of course cuz I knew if I was on the Price is Right.

546
00:31:24,913 --> 00:31:26,240
Scott: I was gonna kill I was gonna win everything.

547
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,706
Rym: Oh my god Legend of the Hidden Temple.

548
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:37,520
Scott: I know I'd win all that when that to watch that guard out Nick arcade Win that shit, but when Nick arcade Nick and broken anyway, it's true, but I would have done better than those punk kids.

549
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:42,812
Scott: But it's like I didn't realize that I was actually such a big fan of them.

550
00:31:42,832 --> 00:31:46,084
Scott: and there's like so many that I liked and watched Frequently.

551
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:59,043
Scott: and it's actually kind of sad because even though I don't watch TV now I realize just from what I know, you know I guess from being one or two spaces away from TV that most there aren't really that many game shows Left.

552
00:31:59,446 --> 00:32:01,639
Scott: a lot of them are changed and aren't what they want to work.

553
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:08,760
Scott: Well to think this one to a lot of reality shows now are actually game shows that they just call reality show.

554
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,200
Rym: Well, that's what I noticed when I was looking through the list.

555
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:16,254
Rym: It's that there was like this Boom of game shows in the 60s and another boom in the 80s.

556
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:24,970
Rym: and then in the 90s There was like this weird like side boom where all the game shows got very slick but also very gimmicky and less gamey.

557
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:29,450
Rym: Yeah, and it was we and like I remember this whole era of that like remember who wants to be a millionaire?

558
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:35,577
Rym: Like these very high production value game shows that were actually less Entertaining to me as game shows.

559
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:39,290
Scott: Yeah, like the like, you know, there are the things that were still game shows, right?

560
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,799
Scott: Like let's make not let's meet it.

561
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,410
Rym: Let's make a deal is like my face.

562
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:44,538
Scott: What's the one with the suitcases?

563
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:49,710
Scott: Oh dealer no deal and I knew I had the workshop I knew I had the word deal in it, but now I learned about that show.

564
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,230
Rym: This is how disconnected I am from from television reality now, you know back because it's an arcade machine.

565
00:32:54,492 --> 00:32:59,029
Scott: No, I knew about pen radio How he was on pen radio.

566
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,288
Rym: Yeah, he talked about how he hated the game and was tricked into being on it as the host and then he liked it.

567
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:11,739
Rym: Yep but anyway Look at that game show Dealer no deal and it's like.

568
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:21,612
Rym: alright the optimal strategy Basically involves ignoring what anyone says and choosing randomly and then stopping when you've either won enough money or have a possibility of winning enough Money.

569
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:34,670
Scott: Yep, that there was a guy in a Forum that I frequent right who was on a more recent episode of who wants to be a millionaire And he just went on and answered questions and he made it to like 60k or something like that.

570
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:35,499
Scott: And he's just like, you know what?

571
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:35,903
Scott: I'm stopping.

572
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:36,409
Rym: I would do that.

573
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:38,378
Scott: I was like I was like hell.

574
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:39,844
Scott: I went in the forum and I was like cuz.

575
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:45,184
Scott: he posted a YouTube bit of his appearance And I was like dude, you're the awesomest you did the smartest thing ever.

576
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:45,505
Scott: Yep.

577
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:46,890
Rym: Don't go over the million dollars.

578
00:33:47,913 --> 00:33:49,246
Scott: What kind of moron are you?

579
00:33:49,387 --> 00:33:54,730
Scott: it's like 60,000 for 15 minutes work and there's a risk if you keep going that you're gonna lose it all.

580
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,800
Scott: How would you possibly not stop and take the money home?

581
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:00,950
Rym: So that's game theory and mechanism design.

582
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:05,590
Scott: Okay, the psychology the mechanisms, but they also have psychology of the sets.

583
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:12,856
Scott: It's like a casino right where the the the audio video lighting of the of the place Yeah makes you do.

584
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:16,989
Scott: they're trying to trick you into doing certain behaviors and the guy totally didn't fall for it.

585
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:22,210
Scott: Anyway, yeah, so what I think the my favoritest game show of all time?

586
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,190
Rym: Oh the one that we have to break this up because there's favoritest and there's also most watched.

587
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:27,833
Scott: Well, I think they're both the same.

588
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:28,436
Rym: price is right.

589
00:34:28,496 --> 00:34:29,098
Rym: Absolutely.

590
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:37,149
Scott: Yeah, whenever I was home from school at 11 o'clock I'd watch the price is right and watch lunch if I was home for school from school for any reason.

591
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,016
Rym: Reruns of the price is right.

592
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:40,639
Scott: It doesn't matter.

593
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:45,902
Rym: It's not like you can remember the episode Yeah, and I remember thinking as a kid that I was really good at it.

594
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:47,830
Rym: And I think nowadays I would be terrible at it.

595
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:55,435
Scott: Well, the problem is is that a lot of the products that you to know the price of right are probably they wonder the manufacturers suggested retail price.

596
00:34:55,475 --> 00:35:03,830
Rym: as a kid for some reason I always knew when I finally figured out why a Lot of the stuff which things were things you've seen grocery stores and in malls.

597
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:09,530
Rym: Yeah, I spent a lot of time as a kid in grocery stores following my parents around buying stuff.

598
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:23,350
Rym: But the point is that because you never pay manufacturer suggested retail price but MSRP was usually listed on the labels of things and because I was a bored kid who Couldn't walk and play my game gear at the same time because the battery only lasted like 10 minutes.

599
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:29,270
Rym: Anyway, I was reading everything that I could read because I just I needed something.

600
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:36,152
Scott: My the reason I knew the prices is because I watch the prices right a lot and I didn't actually know prices of things in Stores.

601
00:35:36,212 --> 00:35:46,047
Scott: and then when I you know now I sort of know the prices because I buy things I credit the price is right with a very important like first step toward game theory mastery.

602
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,395
Rym: when I was a little kid I learned how to be.

603
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:49,439
Scott: you knew when to bid $1.

604
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:58,100
Rym: because one day when I was watching the show one day and someone bid a Dollar and I was like what and then it dawned on me Yeah, and then I learned a lot from watching that show.

605
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,110
Rym: and I remember one day a guy bid $1.

606
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,240
Rym: He was the second to last person.

607
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,546
Scott: the second guy bid the last guy bid $2.

608
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:11,869
Rym: Yep And the first guy like the guy who bid $1 didn't seem to understand what his mistake was.

609
00:36:13,052 --> 00:36:16,270
Scott: Come on old ladies wouldn't even make that mistake and old ladies can spin the wheel.

610
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:18,316
Rym: Yeah You know usually makes the worst mistakes.

611
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:23,770
Rym: were the the people who are in there like 30s 40s who are these super Excitable like Bob Barker's there and they're just like.

612
00:36:24,613 --> 00:36:25,789
Scott: Yeah, they fuck up all the time.

613
00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:29,262
Scott: but the other thing about that show right is the thing I actually like the most.

614
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:33,018
Scott: for all the weird games like Plinko or Punching the holes to grab the money.

615
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:34,444
Rym: I always like the mountain climber.

616
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,710
Rym: We got a mountain climber.

617
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:39,725
Rym: Ah, I like this because a surprising number of people were so stupid.

618
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:40,849
Rym: They let him fall off the top.

619
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:42,161
Scott: Oh, yeah, I don't understand that.

620
00:36:42,182 --> 00:36:45,137
Scott: at least if you're gonna Go to the top stop.

621
00:36:45,197 --> 00:36:45,759
Scott: I'm at the very.

622
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,407
Scott: it was a tiny tiny chance.

623
00:36:47,427 --> 00:36:47,990
Scott: You could be right.

624
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:50,140
Rym: I guess I like the show because it was a real like.

625
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,253
Rym: it was a test of knowledge and skill Mostly skill.

626
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:54,257
Rym: it wasn't that random.

627
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:54,920
Scott: Yeah, there was.

628
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,130
Scott: you know, I mean the mini golf game right you the putt.

629
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,837
Scott: You actually just had the fucking putt.

630
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,609
Rym: I love how he would always putt and he'd always get it in.

631
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:03,628
Scott: I of course, you know, he practiced it.

632
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:05,838
Scott: But you know, he's avid golfer.

633
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:06,843
Rym: Did you see happy Gilmore?

634
00:37:06,964 --> 00:37:08,090
Scott: Yeah prices, right was the shit?

635
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:08,552
Scott: I don't know.

636
00:37:08,613 --> 00:37:11,267
Scott: I think as I nowadays I don't know if it's the shit anymore.

637
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:11,749
Scott: I don't know.

638
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:12,797
Scott: I mean we.

639
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,234
Scott: I remember I had a thing of the day once Whatever.

640
00:37:15,254 --> 00:37:17,966
Rym: It's just Bob Barker was so perfect in that role.

641
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:18,850
Scott: He's the best guy.

642
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:23,440
Scott: Little microphone No one no one can touch.

643
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:25,010
Scott: the original price is right.

644
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,823
Scott: It's just like the untouchable best game show there ever was.

645
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:29,290
Rym: it was also funny.

646
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,439
Rym: It had this good mix of just everything going for it.

647
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:31,820
Scott: Yep.

648
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,230
Scott: It's like, you know, it didn't even matter, you know.

649
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:38,790
Scott: It wasn't like a competition between people like jeopardy where there's winners and losers after in the showcase showdown.

650
00:37:39,192 --> 00:37:40,881
Scott: Yeah, but even then you're in the showcase.

651
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:41,967
Scott: that means you won something.

652
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:45,500
Rym: Yeah Well, there's there's a split in game shows to between.

653
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,149
Rym: there's some game shows especially older game shows.

654
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:48,370
Rym: where?

655
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:51,980
Rym: Winner takes a whole bunch of stuff home and the loser gets buckets.

656
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:55,370
Rym: Yeah, but now I'll like dealer no deal.

657
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,700
Rym: There are shows where the odds are.

658
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,207
Rym: if you get on the show in the first place.

659
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:02,302
Rym: You've already won You're already gonna get a whole pile of money.

660
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,850
Rym: It's just a matter of how much money you get.

661
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:04,959
Scott: I mean even shows.

662
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:06,290
Scott: if you ever watch like double dare, right?

663
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,517
Scott: You'd always you didn't pay.

664
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:09,830
Scott: really pay so much attention to this, but I do remember it.

665
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:15,714
Scott: It's like you'd watch and one family be eliminated and be like and then there would be like this announcement Totally ignore.

666
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:22,196
Scott: their parting gift is a bunch of bicycles or their parting gift is a bunch of video games Because those were all ads.

667
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:27,249
Scott: those are all ads paid for by the people giving out the prizes obviously But you know, it's like you didn't pay attention to it.

668
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:35,039
Scott: But there were parting gifts for pretty much everyone who lost at every stage of the way same thing on legends of hidden temple Every part every kid that was eliminated.

669
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,877
Scott: the more stages you went in the prizes got better Better and better.

670
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:45,887
Scott: So it's like if you had eliminated immediately in the water crossing part You got like some video tapes and if you got to the next part you maybe got a bicycle.

671
00:38:45,928 --> 00:38:48,001
Scott: and if you won Then you won like a trip.

672
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:49,230
Rym: so they don't just like take you out back.

673
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,395
Scott: Yeah, you won like a trip.

674
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:53,889
Scott: you wouldn't like a trip, you know back to Florida again or something like that.

675
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,590
Rym: You know, I think you know I price is right.

676
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,202
Rym: I watched the most and I got the most total enjoyment out of it.

677
00:38:59,243 --> 00:39:03,518
Rym: just cuz I watched so much of it But really I enjoyed.

678
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:05,945
Rym: let's make a deal a lot more really you think?

679
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:07,730
Scott: so cuz I actually didn't watch that all that much.

680
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,630
Scott: I've only watched it maybe like less less than 30 times the host and the psychology of it.

681
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,302
Rym: Monty Hall was just a genius and it was.

682
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:15,430
Scott: he was indeed a genius.

683
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:18,290
Rym: There's something about that like, you know, there's different eras of comedy.

684
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:20,758
Rym: There's a certain level of this kind of.

685
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:28,981
Rym: I'm a game show host from the 70s 80s or early 90s Especially like early 80s mid 80s and late 70s.

686
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:31,790
Rym: that just is different from other kinds of game show hosts.

687
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:35,464
Rym: The only part of it is a certain amount of snark and a certain amount of like.

688
00:39:35,745 --> 00:39:38,229
Rym: we know we're taking the piss But we're doing this anyway.

689
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:46,470
Scott: the only part of the show though that really stands out for me is like the great part was when he would go into the Audience and be like I'll treat you who's got like a coffee cup.

690
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:52,953
Scott: Yeah, you know and people would start bringing weird shit just in case he would say that, you know Anyway, I got a handkerchief.

691
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,695
Scott: you got a handkerchief.

692
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:58,150
Scott: All right you I will trade you such-and-such for the handkerchief.

693
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,002
Rym: So Scott, do you remember the mathematical solution to the Monty Hall of question?

694
00:40:02,323 --> 00:40:04,290
Rym: No, do you remember the Monty Hall problem?

695
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:09,835
Rym: No, what do you always do is give you a choice of three doors, I know the three doors Yeah, so you pick one, right?

696
00:40:09,976 --> 00:40:16,329
Rym: Yep, and then you could either know and then he'd reveal one of them Mm-hmm, and then he'd be like you want to switch?

697
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,384
Rym: Yeah, so there's an absolute answer whether or not you should switch.

698
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,810
Scott: Well, it depends what he revealed.

699
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,056
Scott: What if you revealed like the best thing ever?

700
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:25,440
Scott: Of course, I'll take it.

701
00:40:26,532 --> 00:40:35,149
Rym: No, if you reveal all that anyway So well you should look up the Wikipedia not you but you the audience of GeekNights the Monty Hall problem.

702
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:37,570
Rym: because Don't like spoil it for yourself.

703
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:39,308
Rym: Just read on the internet what the question is.

704
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:45,476
Rym: See if you can work out the answer for yourself and then read the answer because you know what all those game theory books I Bought that's all they do.

705
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:46,541
Rym: Here's the problem.

706
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:48,168
Rym: solve it then they're like, here's the answer.

707
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:49,072
Rym: Here's the man Isn't it?

708
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:50,400
Scott: You should always switch no matter what.

709
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:55,301
Scott: I don't want to spoil it for the people But the point is if he reveals something that's like the best thing ever.

710
00:40:55,682 --> 00:40:57,428
Scott: How could you not go to it?

711
00:40:57,509 --> 00:40:59,940
Scott: It's like You know, it all depends on what's revealed.

712
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,650
Rym: You should read how the Monty Hall question works.

713
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,140
Rym: But anyway, I like to snort like the match game.

714
00:41:05,722 --> 00:41:06,685
Scott: Yeah match game was.

715
00:41:06,845 --> 00:41:12,637
Scott: the match game wasn't really about winning It was just about the humor of making That level like that kind of.

716
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:16,687
Rym: I'm a game show host except it's a whole bunch of people all playing that game.

717
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:18,633
Scott: Yep Yeah, it's weird.

718
00:41:18,653 --> 00:41:19,496
Scott: It's like, you know every.

719
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:34,613
Scott: even though these game shows all all they really have in common is that you had people Competing in some sort of way doing something to win prizes, right even you know Like stuff that didn't even really seem like it was a game show like Takeshi's Castle like you can't win There's.

720
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:36,850
Rym: there's no winner except the audience, right?

721
00:41:39,635 --> 00:41:41,619
Rym: You know, I really like Takeshi's Castle.

722
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,566
Scott: it's pretty much people do something.

723
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:46,350
Scott: then there's a potential prize.

724
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:49,615
Scott: But really the goal was to make Entertainment right?

725
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:53,510
Scott: It was crafting a game where spectating was you know?

726
00:41:53,861 --> 00:42:00,734
Scott: the Sports sort of have this right but sports also tend to try to make a competition and Entertainment.

727
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:05,389
Scott: at the same time and a lot of times, you know Like a game will be boring because it was just a bad game.

728
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:09,364
Scott: But a game show is pretty much a crafted experience to always be entertaining.

729
00:42:09,384 --> 00:42:11,050
Scott: Here's the game fail.

730
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,055
Rym: Here's an idea.

731
00:42:12,136 --> 00:42:13,302
Rym: game shows are entertainment, right?

732
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:13,664
Rym: Yep.

733
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,630
Rym: I Think someone should do now they kind of do this with reality TV, but I say make a straight-up game show.

734
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,629
Rym: That and you know ahead of time it's not you hide it.

735
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:28,253
Rym: It's like a basically professional wrestling of a game show a staged all Actors game show.

736
00:42:28,294 --> 00:42:30,521
Rym: that itself is basically a comedy drama.

737
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:32,067
Scott: You know what it is for wrestling.

738
00:42:32,187 --> 00:42:32,970
Scott: No, you know it is.

739
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:34,499
Scott: It's called the gong show.

740
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,370
Rym: Oh the gong show.

741
00:42:37,592 --> 00:42:40,010
Scott: Hey, dude, you go up and you perfect who can entertain.

742
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:45,870
Rym: Was not that the gong show was more of a sort of like talent competition?

743
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,950
Scott: Yeah, exactly, but it was all about being able to entertain the audience.

744
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:51,416
Rym: People like it like it made like.

745
00:42:51,617 --> 00:42:54,770
Rym: the reason the match game worked is that it was all people who were good at that.

746
00:42:54,872 --> 00:43:02,840
Rym: They were good actors They had jokes ready and it was basically the game show was just kind of like the setting For this comedy of all these people.

747
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,090
Scott: well Hollywood Squares is the same thing also exactly.

748
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:15,350
Rym: But someone should go one step further and not like make a straight-up Fabricated game show that is a TV show because the gimmick of that alone would probably make it weirdly retro popular on TV.

749
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:16,193
Scott: Well, they do have.

750
00:43:16,233 --> 00:43:20,610
Scott: there are some reality shows that like only have famous people on them or at least semi-famous people, right?

751
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:21,976
Scott: So that's you know, a reality show.

752
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,226
Scott: most reality shows aren't actually reality shows.

753
00:43:24,246 --> 00:43:25,050
Scott: They're game shows, right?

754
00:43:26,532 --> 00:43:27,718
Scott: Like look at Survivor, right?

755
00:43:27,778 --> 00:43:29,910
Scott: Like I've never actually watched Survivor, but I know how it works.

756
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,663
Scott: They put people on an island and make them do certain game show.

757
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,010
Rym: Yes, basically, what would you do?

758
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,314
Scott: Yeah, it's like alright everyone.

759
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:38,990
Scott: now you have to eat now you have to eat nasty bugs and it's like wait a minute.

760
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:40,059
Scott: That's not reality.

761
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,326
Scott: That's a game show and then you know The person who's left at the end is the winner and they win a prize.

762
00:43:44,347 --> 00:43:44,910
Scott: That's a game show.

763
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:49,870
Scott: If it was a reality show it would be we're dumping you on an island that has hidden cameras everywhere.

764
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,599
Scott: You can do anything you want except tamper with the cameras.

765
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,944
Scott: Whoever's alive.

766
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,409
Scott: That's a reality show.

767
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,014
Scott: Yeah, a game show.

768
00:43:57,094 --> 00:44:02,270
Scott: everything is so scripted and this you know specific tasks you have to achieve and prizes.

769
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:03,301
Scott: That's a game show.

770
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:08,350
Rym: I Really really liked Family Feud - Family Feud is alright.

771
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:09,555
Scott: I like playing.

772
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:15,216
Rym: Family Feud is the best one to play but to actually Watch it is okay.

773
00:44:15,297 --> 00:44:18,510
Rym: I actually really like playing the old NES SNES versions of it.

774
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:26,504
Scott: I like it when we set up one to do anime Family Feud at an at a you know Anime Club or oh my god, this is kind of a tangent, but it's a tragedy.

775
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,030
Rym: but back at RIT anime, right?

776
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:33,277
Rym: we used to run Family Feud, but it was anime Feud and Because fanboy feud.

777
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:39,730
Rym: Yep, because the people in this anime club actually Watched anime unlike people who go to anime conventions.

778
00:44:40,392 --> 00:44:52,883
Rym: We had some pretty inside baseball questions and topics and people would do surprisingly Well, like if it was something like I don't know How many episodes is an anime on average people in like.

779
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,850
Rym: the top answer is 26 13?

780
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,882
Rym: Like people would give answers that made sense.

781
00:44:57,425 --> 00:45:06,190
Rym: We try to run Fanboy feud equivalents and match games at modern anime conventions and we'll be like name a Pokemon and people that whisper to me as the host.

782
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,276
Scott: They're like, what's Pokemon?

783
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:18,938
Rym: Yeah, we're like name a character from anime who eats too much and they'll be like, uh Pikachu Gee couldn't think of any character.

784
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:25,269
Scott: He's too much even though pretty much every anime has 10 Cuz Eating is their favorite joke.

785
00:45:26,632 --> 00:45:30,630
Rym: But family feud I also enjoyed because people would give some dumb fucking answers.

786
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,018
Scott: Well, I don't care about the dumb answers.

787
00:45:32,058 --> 00:45:34,190
Scott: what I always cared about were the slip-up answers.

788
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,290
Scott: You can always see these on YouTube, which is why I don't need to watch Family Feud.

789
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,249
Scott: But it's like, you know name something's on grandma.

790
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:50,930
Scott: People always accidentally give a match game answer when they're on Family Feud.

791
00:45:51,191 --> 00:45:52,475
Rym: I love how match game it was.

792
00:45:52,535 --> 00:46:03,790
Rym: it would quote unquote accidentally like they say something raunchy when really if you look at the questions They were all pre-scripted to do nothing but make as much reference to sex as they could without getting in trouble.

793
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:08,618
Scott: Yeah, the family feud thing was like name something that the last thing a burglar wants to see is when he breaks into a house naked.

794
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:18,550
Rym: grandma Used to watch wheel of fortune, but it made me feel really smart and made me really not like other people.

795
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:20,696
Scott: Yeah wheel of fortune is.

796
00:46:20,716 --> 00:46:25,473
Rym: I don't think it's that great Pat Sajak, yeah for some reason I like Pat Sajak really I don't.

797
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,009
Scott: I really actually kind of didn't like him.

798
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:30,070
Scott: I mean, he's not like a bad guy, but it's like the way he came off.

799
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,784
Scott: He didn't come up as like he was like excited came off as one.

800
00:46:32,804 --> 00:46:33,749
Rym: It's a job.

801
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:38,670
Rym: Yeah - he's better than these people and he is being degraded by doing this show.

802
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:43,210
Rym: Yeah, that is why I liked him because you could see all of that through his fake smile.

803
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:47,750
Scott: Yeah, but see Alex Trebek was the same sort of way, but it's like I hear he's actually a huge jerk.

804
00:46:48,395 --> 00:46:48,758
Rym: I don't know.

805
00:46:48,779 --> 00:46:52,638
Rym: I just that's what I hear but Fit the feel of jeopardy.

806
00:46:52,919 --> 00:46:56,370
Rym: Pat Sajak fit the pathetic miss of wheel of fortune.

807
00:46:57,895 --> 00:47:01,617
Scott: They definitely do fit their shows but that just because they've done those shows actually.

808
00:47:01,678 --> 00:47:09,404
Rym: because if you want look at you to ever for like wheel of fortune fail because Pat Sajak couldn't like rip into someone who was stupid.

809
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:24,884
Rym: So when someone gave like amazingly Disastrous answers or they guess like X when there's only one spot left in afraid he would always like kind of make this smile and be like Like he'd sigh on the inside like a part of him died.

810
00:47:25,005 --> 00:47:27,652
Rym: Yeah, and then he'd be like Frayed.

811
00:47:27,673 --> 00:47:30,104
Rym: that doesn't quite cut it or nope.

812
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:34,409
Scott: Nope You're spitting so-and-so number three.

813
00:47:37,411 --> 00:47:38,576
Rym: I never liked jeopardy though.

814
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:39,339
Rym: I'll be honest.

815
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:43,295
Scott: Well, I mean jeopardy is sort of you know, it's got its good Little kid.

816
00:47:43,335 --> 00:47:44,240
Rym: I never knew the answers.

817
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:46,230
Scott: It's got good parts and bad parts, right?

818
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,565
Scott: You know, it's like it was weird cuz like you'd.

819
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:51,021
Scott: either you know You crush a category or you wouldn't.

820
00:47:51,082 --> 00:47:54,109
Scott: or to be about something so obscure That's like only some genius guy.

821
00:47:54,210 --> 00:48:05,338
Rym: Well, once I learned how they prepare people for jeopardy and how the selection process works as a kid I was one much less impressed very much less impressive once I saw learned the buzzer matters a lot more than you know The answer.

822
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:13,163
Rym: and even as a kid I hated the fact that you couldn't just buzz in early and then as when I got into high school and join quiz bowl I hated it even more.

823
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:17,603
Scott: Yeah But yeah, you know jeopardy is it's sort of fun because you couldn't.

824
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,190
Scott: you know, it's like you can play along at home.

825
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,060
Scott: But then why not just do Trivial Pursuit?

826
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:22,790
Rym: or why not play jeopardy on the SNES?

827
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,715
Scott: Because you run out of answers.

828
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,083
Scott: like I had I had junior jeopardy for the NES.

829
00:48:27,545 --> 00:48:29,030
Scott: I learned over time.

830
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,215
Scott: I learned every single answer.

831
00:48:30,456 --> 00:48:33,249
Rym: I had wheel of fortune the board game.

832
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:40,890
Rym: My cousin's had that had this huge board with this complicated mechanism for loading up the the phrases and these clickers.

833
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:43,380
Rym: Yep, it was a surprisingly complex game.

834
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,388
Scott: my cousin with my cousin's also had jeopardy.

835
00:48:45,408 --> 00:48:47,573
Scott: the board game Is.

836
00:48:48,016 --> 00:48:50,110
Scott: I never understood why you needed a board game?

837
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:50,691
Rym: It's weird.

838
00:48:50,712 --> 00:48:54,566
Rym: I watched a lot of shows kind of half-assed Lee like I watch anything.

839
00:48:54,586 --> 00:48:57,590
Scott: when you're watching a game show It's like you never really give it your full attention.

840
00:48:57,751 --> 00:49:02,770
Rym: Yeah, like I'd always watch win lose or draw just because it was on before golden girls, which I watch.

841
00:49:02,892 --> 00:49:07,850
Scott: Yeah, you know We always watch like wheel of fortune in jeopardy because they were on before or after the evening news.

842
00:49:08,353 --> 00:49:16,450
Scott: On in the kitchen they're eating during dinner, you know I watched Price is Right because it was on after the early morning cartoons and I was home from school and I was eating lunch.

843
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:21,167
Scott: Yeah, and you know, I couldn't play video games while holding a sandwich but like finders keepers.

844
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:21,910
Rym: I hate it.

845
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:22,918
Rym: I thought it was a stupid like.

846
00:49:22,938 --> 00:49:24,490
Scott: really I actually kind of like that one.

847
00:49:24,691 --> 00:49:30,110
Rym: I didn't like it mostly because it I always caught that tail end of it and it was toward the end of its run.

848
00:49:30,511 --> 00:49:34,106
Rym: So it looked kind of chintzy compared to it shows that came on after.

849
00:49:34,206 --> 00:49:39,550
Scott: it did look chintzy But the thing I liked about it was all was pretty much the tear apart the room looking for shit part.

850
00:49:39,691 --> 00:49:43,290
Scott: The other parts didn't really care about but it wasn't that that was even great entertainment.

851
00:49:43,652 --> 00:49:45,198
Scott: It's just at that age.

852
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,910
Scott: I really wanted to do that like a part of room.

853
00:49:47,950 --> 00:50:00,470
Scott: Yeah, go into some fake room that was full of shit and tear it apart looking for something That was actually actually well hidden But not it was like not so hidden that you could never find much better than the find the flag in the goop on double dare.

854
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:01,120
Rym: That was my.

855
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,638
Scott: that was Yeah, double dare was so hit or miss with like.

856
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:14,345
Rym: some of the challenges were really good challenges and some of them were just Sort of broken, but it was funny because when they were broken It's like everyone on the set knew it was broken and laughed about it.

857
00:50:14,546 --> 00:50:17,929
Rym: Yeah, like it was like Oh, wow, those you can't really actually throw those chickens.

858
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:23,030
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, they sling, you know use the the slingshot to get the eggs in the bowl.

859
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,898
Scott: It's like you get half an egg in the bowl.

860
00:50:24,918 --> 00:50:27,048
Scott: you won because no one could possibly do that.

861
00:50:27,068 --> 00:50:30,076
Rym: at least Double dare the questions looking back.

862
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:34,930
Rym: I remember again really hating the kids up there who never knew the answers to anything.

863
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,200
Scott: I don't know why double dare even bothered with the questions.

864
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,373
Scott: They should just done physical challenges all the time Yeah and they should.

865
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:47,089
Rym: it had like three levels every now and then you'd see like there'd be a smart kid or like two smart kids and They were just answer every question to do no physical challenges and win.

866
00:50:48,952 --> 00:50:52,910
Scott: But at least but at least on double dare the obstacle course always actually worked pretty well.

867
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:55,710
Rym: Oh my god, I want that to be the omegathon finale.

868
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:01,107
Scott: I don't like obstacle course like the hidden temple where incompetent people would just go in and be like derp derp derp.

869
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:06,940
Scott: No one really derped the double dare Obstacle course, they would just physically fail.

870
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,910
Scott: Yeah, they wouldn't derp it out of losing.

871
00:51:08,971 --> 00:51:10,230
Scott: You know not knowing what the fuck to do I

872
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:20,546
Rym: always was vaguely like I wanted to be on double dare because some of the things were really crazy And I just wanted to do them like the the bubble gum Machine where you jump into the top and like just fall through that funnel.

873
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:22,489
Scott: Yeah Some of them were pretty good.

874
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:30,788
Scott: You know some of the most fun ones like were the ones you stayed clean was like the big The the gopher wheel or the hurt the hamster hamster wheel.

875
00:51:30,868 --> 00:51:35,650
Scott: Yeah Well, there's a hamster maze also the wheel where you just run in the wheel enough to get out all the way through.

876
00:51:36,091 --> 00:51:42,314
Scott: But then some of the ones that were actually tricky like here is a slippery surface covered in like chocolate syrup make it to the Other end.

877
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:42,656
Scott: Yep.

878
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:44,408
Scott: I was like, oh, yeah, let's do that.

879
00:51:46,472 --> 00:51:49,350
Scott: But yeah, man there was a. it's weird because there was like this whole job.

880
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:53,170
Scott: It was like two genres like the whole kids game shows versus the adult game shows.

881
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:57,019
Scott: But I watched both even though it was the same age Yeah And I watched a lot of reruns.

882
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:03,165
Rym: and like when I was little I watched like press your luck Mm-hmm, and I didn't even pay attention to it enough to really understand the rules.

883
00:52:03,225 --> 00:52:03,948
Rym: I just watched it.

884
00:52:04,651 --> 00:52:10,757
Scott: Yeah, all I remember is no, I mean, oh, let me hit the button at the right time The little whammy animation would happen.

885
00:52:10,998 --> 00:52:12,786
Scott: Yeah, it was always fun to watch the way of animation.

886
00:52:13,107 --> 00:52:14,660
Rym: Yeah, it's weird It's kind of like I want.

887
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,590
Rym: when I was really young I watched game shows the same way that I played video games.

888
00:52:18,991 --> 00:52:20,939
Rym: Wasn't really trying to win or paying attention?

889
00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:22,967
Rym: just kind of doing what kids do not 100% sent you.

890
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,613
Scott: Well, I mean I was.

891
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:29,232
Scott: I wasn't trying to win because like I wasn't playing but I was yelling by the time the Hidden Temple was On.

892
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,039
Scott: I was yelling.

893
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,470
Scott: I was like, are you stupid?

894
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:37,029
Scott: How could you not know how to put together the fucking silver monkey, you know Why have you not even watched this show if I was there?

895
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:37,732
Rym: I'm Scott if

896
00:52:37,793 --> 00:52:44,730
Scott: my partner failed to put together the silver monkey and then when they came out of there I want to punch them in the face so hard kicked him right in the junk

897
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:46,132
Rym: Silver

898
00:52:46,152 --> 00:52:50,088
Scott: my I would have taken the silver monkey and shoved it right down his throat like you cost me fucking trip to.

899
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:52,479
Scott: oh my god I kill you being slightly older.

900
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,307
Rym: I at least know now that they filmed it all in one go So the kids on it couldn't have seen it.

901
00:52:57,233 --> 00:53:04,325
Scott: I'm just saying in the second end by season two then in season two You should have fucking known how to put together the silver fucking monkey.

902
00:53:04,385 --> 00:53:09,830
Rym: worse than that I think and I hate amazing me that I'll say it was worse than that where the kids on Nick arcade.

903
00:53:11,053 --> 00:53:18,090
Rym: They just like kids you've never played a video game in their lives The final battle where you go inside the video game and it was that crappy blue screen.

904
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:22,850
Rym: Yeah kids just like didn't listen to the host at all.

905
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:27,750
Rym: He'd be like like this one this one video I watched again recently because I remembered it from my childhood.

906
00:53:28,114 --> 00:53:30,735
Rym: there's this one kid and He's one.

907
00:53:31,377 --> 00:53:39,310
Rym: all he has to do is reach up and touch something Yeah, and there's like 20 seconds left with all the monsters pause before they start up again.

908
00:53:39,852 --> 00:53:44,738
Rym: He just kind of stands there like looking around and the guy's like all you have to do Come on, just put your hand up.

909
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:46,770
Rym: all you just put just grab it all you.

910
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,022
Rym: I'll just put your head and then the kid dies and loses.

911
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:50,570
Rym: He's like, ah, you gave it your best.

912
00:53:52,954 --> 00:53:53,678
Scott: That was your best.

913
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,208
Scott: kill yourself, where's that kid now?

914
00:53:56,412 --> 00:53:56,956
Rym: There's no way.

915
00:53:56,976 --> 00:53:58,610
Scott: he made an interview him on nerd alert.

916
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:03,089
Scott: They seem to love interviewing people who are like, you know, we should suggest that.

917
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,958
Scott: But anyway, I never liked like.

918
00:54:05,978 --> 00:54:07,443
Scott: I remember it was a busy.

919
00:54:07,483 --> 00:54:09,370
Scott: It's just frustrating in general, right?

920
00:54:10,112 --> 00:54:19,384
Scott: Even if it's not a game show to watch somebody fail at something that is so easy for you yourself to do Right, even if you're just watching someone play Mario 1 and they run to the first Goomba.

921
00:54:19,686 --> 00:54:20,830
Scott: It's just frustrated babies.

922
00:54:20,931 --> 00:54:22,029
Rym: You can't swing this high.

923
00:54:22,616 --> 00:54:28,057
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know You watch someone try to ride a bicycle and they just keep falling over and it's like oh, come on.

924
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:28,678
Scott: Really?

925
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:29,340
Scott: Come on.

926
00:54:31,192 --> 00:54:32,899
Scott: Or watch someone swimming in a pool in the drowning.

927
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,904
Scott: It's like really kick.

928
00:54:34,486 --> 00:54:35,049
Scott: Is it kick?

929
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:36,293
Scott: Kick.

930
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:38,840
Rym: I guess what bothered me the most wasn't the uncommon.

931
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,874
Rym: so simple because that was more that was entertaining to be so angry at these children But it was.

932
00:54:45,255 --> 00:54:50,430
Rym: I hated the game shows when I realized that there was no skill involved or that the initial rounds didn't matter.

933
00:54:50,531 --> 00:54:52,089
Rym: Anything that had a poorly designed game?

934
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:57,470
Scott: Really bothered me like yeah, cuz like you'd watch something like guts right and some of the things on guts.

935
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:01,375
Scott: Well, actually like pretty cool, you know, like the obstacle course part None of it mattered.

936
00:55:01,415 --> 00:55:03,490
Rym: the agro Craig was worth more points than fucking anything.

937
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,438
Scott: I know that we had to get to the agro Craig, right?

938
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:11,899
Scott: Yeah, but hey, but there were other things that were kind of boring Like like bungee jump basketball.

939
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,485
Scott: It's like alright boring.

940
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:14,970
Scott: Why do they even have that here?

941
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:29,829
Scott: You know, it should have been more like American gladiators Was on right after Saturday morning cartoons and right before pro wrestling and it was the perfect cross between the two.

942
00:55:30,634 --> 00:55:33,010
Scott: I love that shit so much because it was the closest thing.

943
00:55:33,551 --> 00:55:40,930
Rym: But all those gladiators run roids so much to gladiatorial combat the fact that it was direct direct fucking competition.

944
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:43,873
Rym: It was the kind of thing that you always wanted to do I mean as a kid.

945
00:55:43,994 --> 00:55:48,490
Scott: even then some of the games are more entertaining than some of the others are like joust was the shit?

946
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,240
Scott: Yes, but like put.

947
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:51,910
Scott: you know, the volleyballs in the basket.

948
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:57,525
Scott: That was okay, but it wasn't as good as you know, the cages into the things was great.

949
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:58,568
Scott: That was okay.

950
00:55:58,689 --> 00:55:59,170
Scott: It was okay.

951
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:06,146
Rym: I also like the one where you had to get on the the hanging suspended rings and make your way across Because no one ever made it across and they grab you with their legs.

952
00:56:06,226 --> 00:56:06,850
Rym: Just pull you down.

953
00:56:07,512 --> 00:56:12,582
Scott: Oh the one where you had to there was the sea of And the guy was coming after you.

954
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:13,910
Scott: Yeah, I seen it.

955
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:20,897
Scott: The thing is it was so awesome at American gladiators when there's a hard game like that and the the the competitor was just so Good, they actually did it.

956
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:21,441
Scott: It was like fuck.

957
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,670
Scott: Yeah, look at that guy.

958
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,385
Scott: He totally did it and it was the thing about American gladiators.

959
00:56:25,426 --> 00:56:30,066
Scott: It was sort of like You know that the the Japanese thing.

960
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:30,590
Scott: what's it called?

961
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:31,473
Rym: Takeshi's castle?

962
00:56:31,573 --> 00:56:33,322
Scott: No, the one that Nagano won.

963
00:56:33,462 --> 00:56:34,528
Scott: Yeah, what the hell is that?

964
00:56:34,568 --> 00:56:35,010
Rym: Ninja warrior?

965
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:40,527
Scott: Yeah, but it's it's what's it really called because it begins with an S. I'm gonna look it up real quick.

966
00:56:40,547 --> 00:56:42,656
Scott: Okay, Sasuke It's sort of like it was.

967
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:49,750
Scott: Sasuke was like designed to be really impossible But American gladiator was like, you know Sasuke is also on your own.

968
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,557
Scott: It's like what can you do on your own?

969
00:56:51,597 --> 00:56:58,720
Scott: but American gladiator was like versus Sasuke against these Steroid lunatics and I really like direct competition.

970
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,950
Scott: Yes, but also the games were less ridiculous.

971
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,950
Scott: It's like they were balls hard, but they weren't impossible hard.

972
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:12,569
Scott: My favorite I think was the one with the guns and you had yeah, you had to go from station to station shooting different pieces of

973
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:18,677
Rym: No one almost almost no one ever hit with anything and had to get all the way to the end like throw the grenades up There the

974
00:57:18,758 --> 00:57:19,425
Scott: tennis balls.

975
00:57:19,627 --> 00:57:26,370
Scott: Yep I loved it though in something you would shoot the gladiator to disrupt them right with that with like the the air-powered like missile.

976
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:32,170
Scott: But I was always impressed when somebody would just go up there grab the first weapon and shoot the target and be like dang.

977
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:41,310
Scott: And he'd be like, yeah, that's right bitches yep, but I love they always gave me that last chance to escape and That tennis ball that the gladiator shot you with had to hurt us like oh my god.

978
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,339
Rym: I saw a replay where hit a guy on an ankle.

979
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,284
Rym: He had a bruise.

980
00:57:44,304 --> 00:57:45,690
Rym: That was it was amazing.

981
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:48,270
Scott: Yeah, you'd sue if that game show still exists.

982
00:57:50,674 --> 00:57:52,612
Scott: But yeah, no man there was Like.

983
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:53,736
Scott: it's so surprising.

984
00:57:53,776 --> 00:57:59,457
Scott: It's like you don't realize it, but there were so many of these game shows And I liked almost all of them.

985
00:57:59,637 --> 00:58:02,087
Rym: I mean as wild and crazy kids that was.

986
00:58:02,127 --> 00:58:02,990
Scott: I didn't like it that much.

987
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,700
Scott: I watched it cuz it was on my watch.

988
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,544
Rym: It was on before.

989
00:58:05,906 --> 00:58:09,541
Scott: something like It was on when you got home from school and it actually was.

990
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:12,401
Scott: they were only a few episodes and they showed him over and over again.

991
00:58:13,787 --> 00:58:17,040
Rym: Uh Who can forget the acapella ditty?

992
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,270
Rym: from where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

993
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,156
Scott: Yeah, people forget that that was a game show.

994
00:58:21,196 --> 00:58:24,650
Scott: right the game show was actually the first thing and it was the biggest thing.

995
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,602
Scott: But everyone remembers like the video game and mostly now.

996
00:58:27,702 --> 00:58:29,430
Scott: but the game show was actually really great.

997
00:58:29,732 --> 00:58:34,038
Rym: Just the music the cast was funny They had a high production values for what it was.

998
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:36,526
Scott: and that was yet again the kids were stupid.

999
00:58:36,606 --> 00:58:43,769
Scott: yet again the frustrating Final event where you had to put the sticks on the countries and because I had watched the show I knew every fucking country.

1000
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:46,819
Scott: And these kids just didn't fucking know it.

1001
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:47,863
Scott: and it was the worst thing.

1002
00:58:47,883 --> 00:58:48,446
Scott: kids didn't even know.

1003
00:58:48,466 --> 00:58:49,430
Scott: it's like their own state.

1004
00:58:49,932 --> 00:58:51,779
Scott: It was like you just need to go die in a fire.

1005
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:52,361
Scott: You don't know.

1006
00:58:52,381 --> 00:58:54,730
Scott: you got us map is your final challenge.

1007
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:55,814
Scott: It's not like they gave you.

1008
00:58:55,894 --> 00:58:59,988
Scott: you know Africa or Asia right you got us state and you failed it.

1009
00:59:00,229 --> 00:59:00,590
Scott: you suck.

1010
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,857
Scott: Anyway, yeah game shows made of win.

1011
00:59:05,038 --> 00:59:05,479
Scott: we need to.

1012
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:10,775
Scott: I think we need to bring back more of the these older game shows and Less of the reality shows.

1013
00:59:10,795 --> 00:59:12,180
Rym: I just want more.

1014
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,087
Rym: I want different kinds of game shows.

1015
00:59:14,127 --> 00:59:16,403
Rym: I want unique stuff I want like the Monopoly game.

1016
00:59:16,423 --> 00:59:17,230
Scott: That's awful.

1017
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:24,761
Rym: I loved Monopoly the board game as a kid when I was stupid and I heard oh There's gonna be in a Monopoly game show and I was just excited.

1018
00:59:24,902 --> 00:59:25,745
Scott: I really wanted to watch it.

1019
00:59:25,765 --> 00:59:26,167
Scott: real bad.

1020
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:38,700
Rym: the opening theme Oh and oh P o ly and I'm halfway through it and I realized that at no point the skill or Intelligence have anything to do with who win.

1021
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,550
Scott: I really wanted to watch and I was able to watch it like once or twice.

1022
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:49,386
Scott: I don't remember how it worked But like it was something about the timing of it or like it got replaced with other shows so quickly because it was so bad I didn't get to see it that much.

1023
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:52,921
Scott: But yeah, it's like I really wanted to watch it very badly.

1024
00:59:52,942 --> 00:59:54,810
Scott: You know when I was when I knew it was coming out?

1025
00:59:55,493 --> 00:59:58,869
Rym: Oh, well, so Scott I had to get the years before I called you on this.

1026
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:04,382
Rym: You said that Carmen Sandiego the game show was the first.

1027
01:00:04,422 --> 01:00:05,785
Rym: Carmen Sandiego was I wrong?

1028
01:00:06,006 --> 01:00:07,510
Rym: you're wrong so hard.

1029
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,337
Scott: Oh my god, I can't believe that because I was.

1030
01:00:09,437 --> 01:00:09,879
Scott: I was very.

1031
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:10,822
Scott: I was so sure.

1032
01:00:10,883 --> 01:00:13,131
Rym: show debuted in 1991.

1033
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:19,050
Scott: I was so sure that all of the video games and everything else were based on the game show on TV.

1034
01:00:19,351 --> 01:00:20,094
Scott: Yeah, really?

1035
01:00:20,114 --> 01:00:21,560
Scott: I guess I was totally wrong.

1036
01:00:21,862 --> 01:00:22,404
Rym: You're wrong.

1037
01:00:22,424 --> 01:00:23,730
Scott: Why did the first video game come out?

1038
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:26,462
Rym: So, alright, so the program aired on PBS.

1039
01:00:26,663 --> 01:00:30,752
Rym: Yep from 1991 until 1995.

1040
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:34,563
Rym: All right, the first video game came out.

1041
01:00:35,285 --> 01:00:41,557
Rym: Well, it was proposed in 1983 and The first game came out in 1985.

1042
01:00:41,557 --> 01:00:41,738
Rym: Oh, I fail.

1043
01:00:41,778 --> 01:00:45,119
Scott: I Can't believe.

1044
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:45,527
Scott: that's weird.

1045
01:00:47,033 --> 01:00:47,778
Rym: It's not that weird.

1046
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:48,464
Scott: It's weird.

1047
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,773
Scott: It's Broderbund Yeah, but it's like.

1048
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,118
Scott: the thing is is like the these.

1049
01:00:52,239 --> 01:01:01,006
Scott: the format of the video game and the format of the gate of the Game show are actually so similar That I was so sure that the video game was based off the game show because

1050
01:01:01,026 --> 01:01:06,854
Rym: it was very rare For a game show based on anything to in any way resemble the thing it was based on Mm-hmm.

1051
01:01:07,438 --> 01:01:08,929
Rym: That's why some of the best video games were.

1052
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:17,130
Scott: the Game shows were the ones that weren't based on yeah I guess you could categorize game shows right just things that were based on other things and things that were based on nothing like prices.

1053
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:19,684
Scott: Right isn't based on anything, but there was a game show for Scrabble.

1054
01:01:20,268 --> 01:01:28,062
Scott: remember that It was actually pretty bad hit a really bad time slot but like $100,000 pyramid was based on nothing Yeah, you know except itself.

1055
01:01:28,303 --> 01:01:29,490
Rym: That was all right getting Egypt.

1056
01:01:31,491 --> 01:01:36,890
Scott: But yeah, I guess I think the best game shows though if I think back are the ones that are based on nothing but themselves.

1057
01:01:37,454 --> 01:01:43,844
Rym: Yeah, they're also the ones that either were Contrived like match game where we're basically just funny the whole time.
