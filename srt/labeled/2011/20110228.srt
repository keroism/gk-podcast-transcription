1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,385
Rym: It's Monday February 28th.

2
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:12,288
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:16,419
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight model rockets.

4
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:21,677
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,696
Rym: So Scott you have some criticism of the way.

6
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:30,838
Rym: I introduced the show.

7
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:31,540
Scott: yes, I do.

8
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:33,365
Rym: What is your criticism?

9
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:36,573
Scott: you did not make any jokes about rockets or end or so.

10
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:41,027
Rym: so you're gonna pull and or space being cold You're gonna pull a luke you're gonna pull the.

11
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:48,060
Rym: ah I could have made a joke about blah as To actually making the joke about blah, no that's not what I said at all.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,451
Scott: I said we should have joked.

13
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:50,700
Scott: we had a joke opportunity.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,724
Scott: we did not use.

15
00:00:52,106 --> 00:01:00,596
Rym: you know through the magic of podcasting and radio and Adobe Audition we could just rerecord the opening and you could make your joke.

16
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:01,560
Scott: I want to go home.

17
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:04,538
Scott: Ten seconds, that's a long time.

18
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:07,286
Rym: So how come?

19
00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:09,859
Rym: you've been kind of managing servers at work lately.

20
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:12,390
Scott: What do you mean this whole Amazon thing?

21
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,700
Rym: like you it seems like you're doing a lot of IT work lately.

22
00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:18,828
Scott: No the guy you know It's not really that much IT work.

23
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,764
Scott: I mean Amazon does all the actual IT work But it's basically.

24
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:35,189
Scott: you know there was policy that the IT guy had to do all that stuff And I'm the only Unix person there, so You know he wasn't doing it quite right, so now I finally let me do it because you know we got bought And so the policy goes away and whatever.

25
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,074
Scott: so now it's like aha.

26
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:37,360
Scott: I will do this properly.

27
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:47,720
Rym: I just found it funny because I'm kind of being pushed in the opposite direction And I'm getting sent for a lot of training And they basically want me to be a computer scientist and start working on the source code.

28
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,752
Scott: I guess they don't have enough computer scientists.

29
00:01:50,793 --> 00:02:00,180
Rym: It's a complicated situation, but basically issues get complex to the point that when we need to troubleshoot them I Really need to see the source code or I can't troubleshoot.

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:13,197
Scott: This is why the Sarbanes-Oxley policy of developers can't be IT and IT can't be developers is retarded because it's not About code and you know software and hardware it's about systems and the whole thing is an integrated system.

31
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:14,160
Scott: everything goes together.

32
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:16,367
Scott: You can't be separating this stuff out.

33
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:17,972
Scott: one person has you know.

34
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:26,080
Scott: every person involved has to be able to get the whole picture in Their brain from the chips all the way electricity all the way to the user.

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,940
Rym: Every person involved the back office doesn't need to know about the code.

36
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,249
Rym: They just know what works and if it doesn't work the way they expect then someone like me has to fix All the tech people.

37
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,827
Scott: yeah, if you're a tech person you only All the tech people.

38
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:41,499
Rym: you said all the janitor needs to know yeah, okay?

39
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,180
Scott: No, if the tech you know if a tech person only understands one part of the system, right?

40
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,120
Scott: They're inevitably going to fail and fuck up in some way because they will not have accounted for some other part of the system.

41
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:55,240
Rym: Not about a well-managed project.

42
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,937
Rym: I mean you can have like the people who write the stuff that consume the market data for example.

43
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:05,480
Rym: just to use Examples from my industry They really only need to worry about an input stream and an output stream.

44
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:12,852
Rym: And then there's the contract between you know them sending the data out After they've processed it and all the people internally who will subscribe to it and use it.

45
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:18,277
Rym: as long as both ends follow the contract Then neither end needs to know jack shit about what the rest of them are doing.

46
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:24,035
Rym: this is true But but there has to be at least one person who knows how the whole thing works.

47
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:25,439
Scott: That's here's the thing right.

48
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:25,880
Scott: so okay?

49
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,249
Scott: So now you've got two groups right the group that's doing the data Whatever and the group on the other side of that?

50
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,160
Rym: well that you have the third group the glue group the project manager.

51
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:35,783
Scott: Now you.

52
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:41,778
Scott: so now you every time you split up something like that you add bureaucracy and documentation and management.

53
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:43,502
Scott: that now also Cannot fail.

54
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:49,640
Scott: yes, right if you have just a group that handles everything then it you know it might become a deal.

55
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,660
Scott: It might become unwieldy as the system becomes too large.

56
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:54,729
Scott: But have you subdivide the labor?

57
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:57,420
Scott: now you have to add meta labor every time you sub divide.

58
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,250
Rym: I would argue that there are projects that are large enough to where if you do not subdivide it is Basically impossible to actually.

59
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:11,692
Rym: well obviously obviously But I mean I'm in a position where it's an industry where no one person could do Any of this let alone all of it of course.

60
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:12,957
Scott: I mean that's just obvious right?

61
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:19,820
Scott: I mean like Microsoft every person at Microsoft is gonna know all the office and all of Windows and right as retarded.

62
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,439
Rym: Well I guess it's like for you the way you'd like for your job the stuff you need to do on a daily basis.

63
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,240
Rym: you Could do it all but for the fact that there might not be enough hours you care to work.

64
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,207
Scott: Yeah, I mean at my work.

65
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:32,555
Scott: There are one two three four five tech people.

66
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:39,960
Scott: Yeah total Almost entirely tech people and in turn you know the work that I actually do work right.

67
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,869
Scott: There's only three of us, and we're trying to get more people you know.

68
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,096
Scott: so there's really only three people.

69
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:47,366
Scott: so we do not need Meta work.

70
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:49,439
Scott: we need less meta work, so we can do more work.

71
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:58,238
Rym: The reason I brought all this up is I was thinking about the problems I'm facing in my company and the problems that you deal with and the problems other tech people we know deal with.

72
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,247
Rym: and I Feel like every company.

73
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:10,740
Rym: That's small is not doing enough subdivision and every company That's big is doing too much subdivision and like nobody has figured out the right balance except Google.

74
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:13,265
Scott: Here's the is the right balance.

75
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:17,800
Scott: right is pretty much you want to do the most work with the least employees.

76
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:18,869
Scott: That's how you do the math.

77
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,736
Scott: so you say okay?

78
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:26,680
Scott: If we you know right now We've got the system and really none of these people that I have on the team completely understand the whole system.

79
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,948
Scott: They're specializing right which means we probably need a subdivision.

80
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:44,020
Scott: and so if we subdivide then you know these people who are maybe Spending your 20 this four guys And they're on the team and they're spending like a quarter of the day in Meetings because they got to talk stuff over with each other because they don't know the whole thing individually.

81
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:50,680
Scott: So we can add one more person and then these people won't need to have those meetings anymore, and we'll break even right.

82
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,407
Scott: So then you're all you know, but if you have to add three people to do the management, and that's thing That's not a good deal.

83
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:57,335
Scott: It's you know bad move.

84
00:05:57,355 --> 00:05:59,205
Rym: well You got to do it like raid is you know?

85
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:02,898
Rym: for every one stripe of parity you lose one disk exactly.

86
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:03,380
Scott: so you got it?

87
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,145
Scott: Maximized your storage space.

88
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,577
Rym: of course one problem with the philosophy of minimizing the number of employees.

89
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:10,785
Rym: if that's your only metric That's good except.

90
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:12,653
Rym: You have now increased the truck factor.

91
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,420
Rym: That's like a raid zero of people.

92
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,534
Scott: Well I mean you should never have.

93
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:17,857
Scott: you know.

94
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,670
Rym: Minimizing employees, I mean really that's not minimum.

95
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:24,543
Scott: You know that's that's a necessary employees You need to have.

96
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:29,165
Scott: any individual thing needs to be known by at least two people Maybe more though.

97
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:29,988
Rym: I mean we've had problems.

98
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:30,732
Rym: We're a small company.

99
00:06:30,752 --> 00:06:31,576
Rym: only two people know.

100
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:36,560
Scott: and uh well If it's a really small company the company itself is in a truck anyway.

101
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,312
Scott: So you're basically everyone is working their asses off to get the company off the truck.

102
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:41,897
Rym: Think about a weird unintended consequence.

103
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:43,242
Rym: say you have double redundancy.

104
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:49,368
Rym: you have two people who are escalation contacts like they're experts at Everything like there are two people for everything.

105
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:57,694
Rym: if one of any of those pairs quits at any point The second person now has infinite power to demand whatever they want or quit.

106
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,760
Scott: This is why you hire someone really soon.

107
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:05,590
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time even if you hire someone soon takes a while to train and during that time You've got a dictator.

108
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,880
Rym: Just waiting just ready.

109
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:08,846
Scott: When does that ever happen?

110
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,619
Rym: I've considered doing it at times in my life.

111
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,327
Scott: I've never seen anyone actually do it.

112
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:15,391
Scott: You know there's all these stories.

113
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:18,787
Scott: people tell like oh obviously the code You'll have job security.

114
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:24,820
Scott: or oh you know You know if you are the only one who knows something hold your company hostage and demand a raise.

115
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,380
Rym: You know why I think we have those stories.

116
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:33,620
Rym: I don't think anyone ever actually says I'm going to do this though There was that Slashdot article like a week ago about a guy who did that for a bunch of arcade games.

117
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:37,399
Scott: I was gonna say the guy who did the whack-a-mole, and you know what they totally got caught.

118
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:53,739
Rym: well I think someone a Slashdot said that we were very lucky that very few people in the world have three factors together that are one good at software engineering two also good at social engineering and three evil evil or evil.

119
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,519
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't happen to us.

120
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:56,920
Rym: Yeah.

121
00:07:57,222 --> 00:08:05,489
Rym: But I think what happens is smart people find Poor code or a bad situation tech wise and they look at it And they think there's no way someone's that stupid.

122
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,400
Rym: it had to have been someone who's really clever trying to keep the job.

123
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:11,666
Rym: So it's Monday.

124
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:12,590
Rym: There's a ton of tech news.

125
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:14,420
Rym: I don't think we need to talk about Libya.

126
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,344
Rym: I think it's obvious.

127
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:19,439
Rym: the internet's starting to come back online bit by bit in all the free areas and go internet goo.

128
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,754
Rym: I think the nerds are winning in at least two of these countries.

129
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:22,277
Rym: all right.

130
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:22,639
Scott: That's good.

131
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:25,620
Rym: So got any tech news?

132
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:36,808
Scott: Yeah, so Apple announced this thunderbolt today or not today a while ago last week something few days ago right, and it's basically it's a new connector that goes on the new MacBooks.

133
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,100
Rym: right and What does it replace?

134
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,774
Scott: Well, it's actually kind of interesting right in that it replaces.

135
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:45,119
Scott: I guess it doesn't replace USB.

136
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,870
Scott: I mean at least not yet because the laptop still has two USBs.

137
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:58,830
Rym: It doesn't replace firewire because the laptop still has a firewire on it At least yeah, well when I got piece you know when I got a PCI there were still ISAs in my computers, right?

138
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:04,910
Scott: So they're hoping to you know get you know to beat out USB and also firewire and hopefully move everything to Thunder.

139
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,254
Scott: That's their whole their goal right?

140
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:06,977
Rym: I'm all.

141
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:08,301
Rym: I don't think that'll happen.

142
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,047
Scott: know what I think is interesting though.

143
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:11,697
Scott: Is that they managed to?

144
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,702
Scott: You know cuz Steve Jobs hates more connectors right he wants less.

145
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:24,330
Scott: so even though he might be dead soon, which is weird He wants less connectors in the side of the laptop.

146
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:41,610
Scott: So what he did is he said aha the Thunderbolt will simultaneously not only be a new really fast data port but it will also be the video out port and it's the same shape as the Like the display adapters, so if you have one of those you know the newest MacBook.

147
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,005
Scott: So he's the second newest now because there's newer ones right or even the third newest.

148
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:48,716
Scott: I think is the same connector And you have the thing that you know.

149
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:49,941
Scott: so it's basically the mic.

150
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:52,110
Scott: the mini display port is the same shape.

151
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:59,328
Scott: So if you want to hook up to a projector you connect it to the Thunderbolt port the same port that you would have connected You know before.

152
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:01,233
Scott: So it's.

153
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:15,169
Scott: it's a port that can go theoretically up to 10 gigabits per second Which is twice as fast as the theoretical maximum of USB 3.0 and is Three point something times as fast as the theoretical maximum of e of it.

154
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,101
Scott: Yes, ATA, so it is the fastest theoretically.

155
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:25,130
Scott: yeah, it can do video output So connecting to the projector and it can also do just data, and it can also daisy chain.

156
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,954
Scott: So if they get their wish and this is the only connector on the laptops of the future or at least the MacBooks of the Future you won't.

157
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:32,937
Scott: they'll decrease.

158
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,664
Scott: they won't have any USBs or firewires.

159
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:48,650
Scott: It'll just be power Ethernet's The Thunderbolt right which will do your video out and your data out And your headphone hole your microphone hole and maybe your SD card hole right the and those will be the only holes.

160
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:50,377
Scott: They'll lose three holes.

161
00:10:50,438 --> 00:11:02,050
Rym: see the thing is with stuff like this the killer app would be It would have to be able to have adapters on it where you could plug in firewire and USB devices because the amount of Legacy equipment isn't just like in many cases.

162
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,670
Rym: I always say yeah fuck the legacy equipment when we're trying to move to some modern technology.

163
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:11,610
Rym: But there is just way too much legacy equipment, I mean I just bought a brand new HD camera.

164
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:12,533
Rym: What's it got?

165
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:13,436
Rym: USB?

166
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:16,004
Scott: Yeah, so here's the thing right is first of all can't.

167
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:22,859
Scott: in terms of cameras and like you know He's mostly aiming this because this was Simultaneous with the release of a new final cut.

168
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,890
Scott: I think I think there was a new final cut.

169
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,915
Scott: So this is aimed at the video.

170
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:36,578
Scott: people right they want you to get the ultra high-res videos Onto your Mac and they also want the ultra high-res videos to go on like a raid and you could work so fast with that If you have ten gigabits per second, but

171
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:38,025
Rym: I have a NAS ten

172
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:39,130
Scott: times gigabit Ethernet.

173
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:43,210
Rym: Yeah, but I have a NAS that stores my video library and hard drives are cheap.

174
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,778
Rym: I have a local disk that just has everything on it.

175
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:46,480
Rym: That's fast enough.

176
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:48,828
Scott: Okay, so how fast your local disk is?

177
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:49,008
Scott: sata?

178
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,218
Scott: Yeah, right, which is three.

179
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,002
Scott: This is not.

180
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:53,730
Rym: this is ten all right, so this is ten.

181
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:56,346
Rym: How long before the next standard of you know whatever?

182
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:56,990
Rym: say that dry?

183
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,550
Scott: What if you're working with like you know high high resolution from a video from like a red camera, right?

184
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:04,590
Scott: This is actually gonna be significant for you.

185
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:15,606
Rym: It's gonna be significant only in the short term because that sort of external connector when there's so many different things that need to connect To it cannot evolve as quickly as something like an internal hard drive connector.

186
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:16,510
Rym: where the industry has been nervous.

187
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,458
Rym: It's very successful at saying fuck it.

188
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:21,190
Rym: There's the new one over and over again and a very short cycle.

189
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,915
Rym: Yeah, I mean USB.

190
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:22,975
Rym: it.

191
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:29,359
Rym: look how long it took to get USB to USB 3. thunderbolt will not be able to advance I don't think in the long run.

192
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:35,230
Scott: Well USB 3 isn't even out yet And it's only theoretically five gigabits per second, that's what I'm saying.

193
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:46,189
Rym: I don't think that anything external like this if it is the you know what the connector to rule them all is Going to be able to keep up with just the advancement of internal proprietary things.

194
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:51,285
Rym: Plus if you're doing so gonna make the time if you're doing stuff with red like for real.

195
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:54,922
Rym: if I was doing real video editing I'd have some iSCSI or some fiber channel.

196
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:56,410
Scott: How fast is that theoretically?

197
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,393
Rym: Fucking fast.

198
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:01,402
Rym: that is what we use for like multi terabyte real-time databases.

199
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:05,130
Scott: Let's go look at how fast fiber channel is Speaking.

200
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,738
Rym: the other question is how fast are the disks?

201
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,650
Rym: I mean disks often can't even drive network bandwidth in some cases.

202
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:13,640
Scott: Yeah, well, you know, you're never gonna.

203
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,370
Scott: it is a theoretical maximums, right?

204
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:35,790
Scott: so but the point is is that there definitely is a bottleneck in this transfer department for You know people working with high-res videos, especially right, you know I mean these people are like, oh I gotta wait so long to you know transfer my videos Anyway, so I think it'll be interesting if they actually push this to say like iPods and stuff like that.

205
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,491
Scott: You know if the iPhone just has one of these and they get rid of the dock connector or something like that You know what?

206
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:43,430
Rym: This really means it's gonna be a fucking pain in the ass to run panels at conventions.

207
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:44,795
Scott: Well, no it might.

208
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:50,662
Scott: if everyone will have the same stupid little video adapter Then we'll buy the little adapter for it to VGA and you'll connect.

209
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:53,534
Scott: Yeah, exactly and you it's the same adapter They already sell right?

210
00:13:53,554 --> 00:13:58,253
Scott: so I have one at work and so basically you would you could attach it if they put it on The iPhone or whatever.

211
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:07,330
Scott: you could attach it directly to your iPhone to VGA instead of using the weird dock connector to RCA thing I have now anyway, so it is sort of interesting in those departments.

212
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:16,846
Scott: However, I think it is still kind of I'm bleh on it even though it is ridiculously fast Oh or a reason other than the ones we've already talked about and this is the thing.

213
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:17,870
Scott: I don't understand right?

214
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,910
Scott: It's like why are they so in love with these external connectors, right?

215
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,891
Scott: It's like he wants to reduce the number of ports on the side of the laptop to make it more beautiful and I can understand That.

216
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:31,162
Scott: right that you definitely things look better when there's less holes in them, right?

217
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:35,075
Scott: This is it's obvious, but How is it less?

218
00:14:35,116 --> 00:14:37,890
Rym: I couldn't make it made a joke there about less holes, right?

219
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:43,130
Scott: But how is it less ugly right to have a huge stack of daisy chained?

220
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,590
Scott: External devices because you can't modify any internal parts of the computer?

221
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,230
Rym: Yeah, that's the one thing about my PC is that inside is an ugly mess of cables.

222
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,310
Rym: You know what's connected to those cables like six terabytes worth of storage, right?

223
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,561
Scott: So it's like if they would just they only make one computer.

224
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:04,581
Scott: that lets you put anything inside the Mac Pro Which is ridiculous, you know and I can understand.

225
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,409
Scott: you don't put anything in a laptop, right?

226
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,410
Scott: But it's like you want to make it more beautiful, right?

227
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:17,285
Scott: You should maybe make the iMac right allow people to put stuff in it make the iMac more like, you know Something small that you can open.

228
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:26,558
Scott: well Maybe at least I just I feel like this standard won't and then you won't have a nasty ugly mess of external piles of crap But the wires all over your desk.

229
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:28,670
Rym: I don't think it'll matter in the long run.

230
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:36,478
Rym: I mean I agree with you there But I just think this is going to be like firewire and that it'll eventually it could replace firewire in the long I think it will.

231
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,450
Scott: I think that's what it will be.

232
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:44,056
Scott: It will be like firewire and it there'll be a lot of Mac specific things for it and there will be lots of the high Video people my audio.

233
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:50,398
Rym: because the thing is I had never had used for firewire in my entire life Until I started doing audio.

234
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:52,646
Scott: for I mean these are on the MacBook Pro, right?

235
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,765
Scott: They're not on the MacBook At least I don't think that.

236
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:58,630
Rym: well The thing is because firewire that the advantage over USB is that it's higher bandwidth.

237
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:06,630
Rym: I can actually have you know eight streams of real quality audio going into my computer into eight channels and they haven't removed the USB yet.

238
00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:13,530
Scott: So this is that you know This is a thing for the pro video type people who are all about max and they will love it and you know.

239
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,598
Scott: Well, hopefully, you know replace firewire.

240
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:18,510
Rym: I I think it'll absolutely replace firewire if it works.

241
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:23,730
Scott: Yeah, except for the people but people those people are still gonna demand firewire for a couple years.

242
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,270
Rym: Well, the thing is I haven't looked at the spec.

243
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,550
Rym: I mean, I assume it does all the kind of low latency synchronized time things that fire.

244
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:36,895
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's actually kind of ridiculous because it's bi-directional so you can actually get 10 gigabits both ways Right.

245
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:51,710
Scott: and because you can daisy chain it you could for example Load video from a camera So that's one direction at 10 gigabits per second and also save it to a disk In the daisy chain at 10 gigabits per second theoretically right at the same time simultaneously, right?

246
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:58,430
Rym: So that's just a flashback to the old days of daisy chaining scuzzy devices together and having that little terminator cap at the end.

247
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:01,650
Scott: I mean technology wise, you know, there's nothing really wrong with it.

248
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:13,586
Scott: It's faster than everything else on paper and you can do it's you know, you can use it for you know Video like just plug a monitor into it because it is just a video out port and also data.

249
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:16,695
Scott: That's pretty nice But it's still.

250
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:18,903
Scott: it's just gonna replace for the pros.

251
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:21,069
Scott: I don't think anyone is gonna use it for normal.

252
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:26,326
Rym: You know what else would have made it work if it were a replacement for HDMI.

253
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:28,275
Scott: I think yeah You can do that.

254
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:31,110
Rym: know what I mean straight up and TVs supported it with no DRM.

255
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:32,416
Scott: Yeah, you just need it.

256
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:36,980
Scott: You can if you get a. if you if you buy a Mac monitor You just plug the monitor directly.

257
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,590
Rym: Yeah, but if I buy a Sony TV They're not gonna have out in and outputs on the TV for this anytime.

258
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,497
Scott: Well, I think that's Apple's one problem.

259
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:44,279
Scott: right is the last.

260
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,093
Scott: every time they come there are certain things Apple does openly and certain things They do closed.

261
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:51,208
Scott: Lee right and their ports have always been something they do openly.

262
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,741
Scott: they you know The mini DisplayPort which is the same shape as this.

263
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:55,430
Scott: they put out the specs like people.

264
00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:58,141
Scott: Please make things using mini DisplayPort right.

265
00:17:58,382 --> 00:18:01,917
Scott: if they made it an open standard, you know They wanted people to do it, but no one did.

266
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:16,650
Scott: they really need to stop being you know Non-communicative assholes and they need to go out to other the companies they hate right and be like look Sony Make TVs with this hole in it, you know, hey, you know Dell make laptops with this hole in it.

267
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:20,986
Scott: Let's all make laptops and and TVs and displays and dry.

268
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:21,768
Rym: You know, they don't.

269
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:22,190
Rym: how do you know?

270
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,845
Rym: There aren't all these NDA conversations all the time Like hey, we're doing this and maybe Dell says fuck you.

271
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:27,650
Scott: I mean, we have no idea.

272
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,061
Scott: It's could possibly be that the other companies say fuck you.

273
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:31,990
Rym: I don't think Apple is run stupidly.

274
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,690
Rym: I don't think they would do something stupid unless they didn't want it to actually be the end-all.

275
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,095
Rym: I don't think that's the case either.

276
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:39,360
Scott: I think I think they should.

277
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:44,790
Scott: you know, they're really if they whoever's saying no to it Right, whether it's Thunderbolt or something else, right?

278
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:51,350
Scott: It could be not invented here syndrome on the part of the other guys Right being like oh we don't use Thunderbolt as an Apple thing then Apple have power.

279
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,730
Rym: I mean, it could be we're already working on USB 4 or something internally.

280
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:57,552
Scott: Yeah You know They should all.

281
00:18:57,713 --> 00:18:59,979
Scott: everybody including Apple needs to get together.

282
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,162
Scott: and what really we need?

283
00:19:01,604 --> 00:19:03,228
Scott: all of these ports every single one of.

284
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:06,260
Rym: we can't even Convince them to agree on a power standard.

285
00:19:06,702 --> 00:19:08,770
Scott: Yeah, actually the cell phone guys are getting pretty close.

286
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,372
Scott: Yeah, they're close.

287
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:11,418
Rym: But how long did it take forever?

288
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:12,241
Scott: Yeah, right.

289
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:15,010
Scott: I you know, cuz they all wanted to sell their AC adapters.

290
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,986
Scott: They make a lot of money on this.

291
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:23,194
Scott: Yeah I remember how would you tell the shirt tell the shareholders that you're gonna standardize that you're gonna lose all your revenue from Not gonna fly.

292
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,943
Scott: Anyway, they're really all these ports USB firewire every.

293
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,609
Scott: everything is just serial data transfer every.

294
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:30,150
Scott: that's all it is.

295
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:39,290
Scott: And we really need one wire for serial data transfer, right and we just need to crank the fuck up, you know And just put it out.

296
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:46,457
Scott: and I think the reason that Apple was able to come out with this is because like USB for example USB 3 is Slow because it is a working group.

297
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:53,630
Scott: all these guys get together and argue until they finally agree on what it should be Whereas Apple just says here's what it should be and here's the spec.

298
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,665
Scott: Everyone can look at it right which allows because they don't have to argue with anyone.

299
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:57,590
Scott: They just do what they want.

300
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:00,610
Scott: They're able to just come out with it and have it be finalized immediately.

301
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:02,722
Scott: But then who else is going to adapt it?

302
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,553
Scott: if they you know, they have complaints with it so they're like well That's your.

303
00:20:05,614 --> 00:20:11,810
Scott: Apple did things the way they wanted to and if they were Arguing with us in a consortium and we wouldn't have agreed and we wouldn't have done, you know.

304
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:23,429
Scott: So we're not gonna put that in our computer because it doesn't do X Y & Z which we would have argued for and are arguing for so that all that sort of you know What's it called all those concessions and

305
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,113
Rym: Compromise compromise

306
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:26,434
Scott: the thing

307
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,342
Rym: that we hate above all other things.

308
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:28,683
Scott: Yes.

309
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:34,189
Scott: That's what slows one down You know, but at the same time without the compromise, it's an Apple only thing.

310
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:41,657
Rym: Yeah, well then you get into the Constantine since you a situation that we always talk about on Friday night party line Which may be coming back.

311
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:51,281
Rym: Okay, so very briefly I don't want to talk about this a lot But there's an article on slash shot and it was from business and law About how Craigslist is and there was a group that was studying this.

312
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:53,910
Rym: I quote cesspool of crime.

313
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:56,136
Scott: It's I wouldn't say it's a cesspool.

314
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:58,823
Scott: It's more of a. it's more of a bog.

315
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:00,267
Rym: I mean you want a cesspool.

316
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:01,350
Rym: YouTube comments.

317
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:03,277
Rym: That is a cesspool.

318
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:05,667
Scott: It's not really a cesspool at cesspool.

319
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:06,350
Scott: That's more of a.

320
00:21:09,712 --> 00:21:15,030
Rym: Or alright fine cesspool, let's look at the common sense any local newspaper in America.

321
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,419
Scott: Well, those thing is those aren't cess at all.

322
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,684
Scott: The problem is is it's more.

323
00:21:18,764 --> 00:21:21,314
Scott: those are more if it's all says no Those are like a latrine.

324
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:24,185
Scott: They've been cleaned thoroughly and it's stupid.

325
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:25,610
Scott: I don't understand why the newspapers do this.

326
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:29,082
Scott: They leave the comments there, but all the comments say comment removed.

327
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:32,498
Scott: if don't put the words comment removed Just completely remove it.

328
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,090
Scott: So no one even knows the comment was ever there.

329
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:39,986
Rym: I realize it'd be simple enough to remove most of the stuff that happens on every local newspaper site.

330
00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:48,819
Rym: Just filter out basic swear words and racial slurs 90% of it and spelling every possible spelling of every racial slur.

331
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:52,669
Scott: if anyone has bad spelling just don't let their post go through.

332
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:57,530
Rym: Yeah We need that cat like, you know stupid like detecting or system.

333
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:14,230
Rym: anyway Craigslist is kind of a cesspool in my opinion partly because it is used by the masses like Everybody except the oldest of the old and the disconnected of the disconnected Knows that if you want to get rid of a busted old refrigerator you put it on Craigslist and someone will come take it.

334
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,409
Rym: Yep, and if you want to have sex with a stranger Craigslist is where you go.

335
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,835
Rym: Yeah, I want to buy a crack pipe.

336
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:21,159
Rym: You want to complain about crack pipes.

337
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,444
Rym: Craigslist is where you go.

338
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,130
Rym: Yeah, it is democratized.

339
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,116
Rym: It's so simple.

340
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:25,821
Rym: It's so dumb.

341
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:27,672
Rym: It looks like it's out of 1992.

342
00:22:27,672 --> 00:22:35,053
Rym: It is so everyone can use it and as a result There's a lot of crap on there and smart people don't fall for the crap because they're not Stupid.

343
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,579
Scott: Craigslist also has many warnings.

344
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:38,024
Scott: It tells you how not to fall for crap.

345
00:22:38,044 --> 00:22:50,396
Rym: They get you're like, hey If somebody doesn't say where they are if a dude Leads you at 1130 at night behind the Walmart to pick up your free HDTV Yeah, you're gonna get raped.

346
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:53,870
Rym: Yeah, but I want to point something out this study.

347
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:58,250
Rym: I was reading the article I was thinking about this and I had a lot to say about society and culture and technology.

348
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:01,197
Rym: And then I noticed who did this study?

349
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:08,158
Rym: this study the yellow page list sucks and is a bastion of crime Newspaper classified organization.

350
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,745
Rym: It is done by the aim group.

351
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,010
Rym: Are you familiar with the aim group?

352
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,398
Scott: Are you talking about a?

353
00:23:12,418 --> 00:23:13,509
Scott: I am from Marvel Comics?

354
00:23:15,213 --> 00:23:15,535
Scott: What?

355
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:16,360
Scott: No, you don't know.

356
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,386
Scott: aim from Marvel Comics.

357
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:25,530
Rym: Oh quote consulting services for interactive media and classified advertising.

358
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:32,508
Rym: huh, so the people who organize the people who sell ads in out-of-date ad selling.

359
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,150
Rym: media like newspapers are Trying to say that Craigslist is a den of iniquity.

360
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:46,810
Scott: But yeah aim in Marvel Comics is advanced idea mechanics and it's sort of just generic terrorist bad guy.

361
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:49,075
Rym: Not that bad of a name though.

362
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:52,448
Scott: Yeah, it was originally no apparent according to Wikipedia.

363
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:53,050
Scott: I didn't know this.

364
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,718
Scott: It was originally known as them.

365
00:23:54,738 --> 00:23:57,390
Scott: It's first mentioned in strange tales.

366
00:23:57,832 --> 00:23:59,418
Rym: What does them stand for?

367
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,867
Scott: It just it's the word them really?

368
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:04,497
Scott: Yeah It could have been an acronym.

369
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,710
Scott: no, but aim is advanced idea mechanics, they're just generic.

370
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:08,758
Scott: They're sort of like foot.

371
00:24:08,778 --> 00:24:10,188
Scott: so the Foot Clan, right generic.

372
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:18,770
Scott: It's like we need some bad guys in this in this comic But we don't have any specific villain we want to use right because that would mean plots.

373
00:24:19,254 --> 00:24:26,130
Scott: So we had to just have generic bad guys Terrorists of some sort to fight because we're focusing on some heroes internal drama and they need to fight something.

374
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,096
Scott: So here we go aim bat.

375
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:30,545
Scott: just some aim agents are doing some terrorism.

376
00:24:30,926 --> 00:24:31,367
Scott: There we go.

377
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,170
Scott: Whatever.

378
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:42,400
Rym: So things of the day, I think this is pretty cool.

379
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,936
Rym: So a lot of people don't realize that air rifles have existed since the 1500s.

380
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:48,120
Rym: give or take wait.

381
00:24:49,302 --> 00:24:52,452
Scott: How could there be an air rifle in the 1500s if they didn't have compressors?

382
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:54,117
Rym: They did have compressors.

383
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:54,820
Scott: Okay, that's fun.

384
00:24:56,481 --> 00:25:06,478
Rym: So basically these air rifles and later 1617 even up through the 1800s they were used by militaries Especially in Austria should be with BBs.

385
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:13,866
Rym: You realize if you take basically a musket and make it air power to have like a metal canister That'll hold a lot of air in it compressed.

386
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:17,095
Rym: It'll kill a guy at a surprising range.

387
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:17,717
Scott: Well, it's shooting.

388
00:25:17,737 --> 00:25:18,660
Scott: what a musket ball.

389
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,490
Rym: Yes, a rifle musket ball.

390
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:21,094
Rym: What do you mean?

391
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:22,200
Rym: Yeah, there's science.

392
00:25:22,341 --> 00:25:26,160
Rym: I watch videos of them shooting it through inch thick pieces of wood from quite a distance.

393
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:27,608
Scott: Yeah, I mean that'll kill a guy.

394
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:33,177
Scott: but the thing is even actual muskets You know weren't as good at killing people as guns with actual bullets.

395
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:35,894
Scott: because you know Balls, they're not bullets.

396
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:39,491
Rym: Uh You realize we invented rifling a long time ago, right?

397
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:41,780
Rym: Yeah, these are rifled air rifles.

398
00:25:42,581 --> 00:25:43,467
Scott: Oh, they're not just yes.

399
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:45,459
Scott: It's not just a musket ball going down a tube.

400
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:48,290
Rym: Yes, and even it does.

401
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,060
Scott: the front of it doesn't look like a trumpet Scott.

402
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:58,120
Rym: There was even a time when you could shoot musket balls that would take advantage of rifling to a degree Really because they conform to the edges and there was this famous but it has to be point in the in the front?

403
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:07,480
Rym: No, it doesn't that's not why anyway, so There there's this one particular air rifle that was used by the Austrian military and they had a lot of advantages.

404
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:13,860
Rym: For example, if you had a squad that had these rifles they could shoot like 20 times before they had to be recharged.

405
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:17,880
Scott: Oh, yeah, cuz you wouldn't have to keep you know, pulling the thing back and they had auto loaders.

406
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:19,240
Rym: They put all the ammo in him.

407
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,100
Rym: So basically you could shoot like 20 rounds like bam bam bam bam bam.

408
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,766
Scott: Well, but didn't you have?

409
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:25,160
Scott: maybe the thing is did you have to pump it?

410
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:25,863
Rym: It's no.

411
00:26:25,903 --> 00:26:28,315
Rym: you shoot 20 or so and then you have to pump it.

412
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:28,797
Rym: Uh-huh.

413
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:31,231
Scott: Yeah So hard was it to pump?

414
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:32,378
Scott: was it all like it to oil it?

415
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:35,008
Rym: really good You had to pump it 1,500 times to reload it.

416
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:36,052
Rym: Okay.

417
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:37,437
Scott: Is that really how many?

418
00:26:37,537 --> 00:26:37,858
Rym: Yes.

419
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:38,320
Rym: What?

420
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,493
Rym: Yes, so what they do is they carry like three canisters of compressed.

421
00:26:42,574 --> 00:26:46,747
Scott: So wait, but someone did the original 1,500 pumpings times three canisters.

422
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:48,632
Scott: Yes, who's doing these pumpings?

423
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:49,574
Rym: board soldiers.

424
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:51,139
Scott: Why don't they do it with a?

425
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,886
Rym: Because they had cars in the 1500s.

426
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,656
Rym: Oh, what do you mean cars?

427
00:26:56,736 --> 00:26:57,700
Rym: No with engines?

428
00:26:58,302 --> 00:27:01,594
Rym: Yeah, exactly how else are they gonna do it with that?

429
00:27:01,614 --> 00:27:02,257
Scott: the lumber mill.

430
00:27:02,297 --> 00:27:04,524
Scott: you can have a you know You can have the the sawmill or the.

431
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:06,190
Rym: alright, so I'm on the road.

432
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,494
Rym: Now what I shot?

433
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:12,551
Scott: 22 guys three times No, but you can load up so many of them and fill your heavy.

434
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:13,875
Scott: They're made of iron.

435
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:15,300
Scott: You put them in the wagon.

436
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:17,132
Scott: Yeah soldiers gotta get anyway.

437
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:18,220
Scott: and the oxen pole.

438
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,140
Rym: That's not the point.

439
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:33,471
Rym: So the point of this is that apparently Lewis and Clark brought one of these particular ones the Giordoni With them on their famous adventure and this one rifle that they brought that was an air rifle is actually credited with them Surviving the expedition.

440
00:27:33,855 --> 00:27:37,115
Scott: Uh-huh Single-handedly did it like get wet and they had to shoot something?

441
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:40,260
Scott: No, so That would be a major advantage.

442
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,840
Scott: Right is that if you're ever musk of an old-fashioned muskie gets wet might as well just throw it out.

443
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,820
Rym: That is one advantage.

444
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,505
Scott: But if this thing gets wet It'll probably fire some time.

445
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:53,940
Rym: another advantage that if you designed these to be subsonic to where the projectiles coming out Don't break the sound barrier.

446
00:27:54,664 --> 00:27:56,695
Rym: They don't have much of a muzzle report.

447
00:27:57,117 --> 00:27:57,620
Scott: That's true.

448
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,978
Scott: If you even get a modern-day BB gun is basically silenced even about a silencer on it.

449
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:04,877
Rym: It goes like so there are many advantages.

450
00:28:04,937 --> 00:28:13,892
Rym: but Lewis and Clark's expedition had a lot of people with it a lot of supplies a lot of very valuable materials Yeah, and a lot of weapons a lot of muskets and powder.

451
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,887
Rym: apparently only one air rifle Yeah, and the air rifles would save them.

452
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:31,340
Rym: So it is argued in this video goes into a lot more detail that Basically while they were traveling Any one of the Indian tribes along there, you know multi-year expedition could have trivially overpowered them and all their firepower.

453
00:28:32,528 --> 00:28:33,838
Rym: Had any of the tribes done that?

454
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:44,180
Rym: Lewis and Clark had with them enough musket balls and powder and rifles and provisions to where that tribe could have basically subjugated every other tribe in the area.

455
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,269
Scott: oh, that's clever.

456
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:53,240
Rym: and The question was how did they travel so far without even one Indian tribe thinking we could totally take these fuckers out hiding?

457
00:28:53,902 --> 00:28:54,485
Rym: They didn't hide.

458
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:55,368
Rym: they traveled openly.

459
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:56,854
Scott: They're using the air rifle.

460
00:28:56,874 --> 00:28:58,339
Scott: The Indian tribes wouldn't have heard them.

461
00:28:58,701 --> 00:29:02,600
Rym: So they only had one and they weren't just killing all the people as they've marched.

462
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:10,073
Scott: No, I mean if they were hunting using only the air rifle now No Indians only would have been able to find them by sight and hidden.

463
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:12,040
Rym: so visually you want me to spoil it.

464
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,599
Rym: You want to watch the video you can spoil it.

465
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:21,860
Rym: So what they did is they put out they carry dress uniforms with them and Every time they think they knew an Indian tribe was like up the river or something.

466
00:29:22,181 --> 00:29:24,909
Rym: They were dressed in full regalia and they'd play the fights.

467
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:32,495
Rym: They banged the drums and they just marched right into the Indian City Mmm, and they march in and they give them gifts like here's some cloth.

468
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:33,318
Rym: Here's some stuff.

469
00:29:33,378 --> 00:29:33,960
Rym: We're nice.

470
00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:39,579
Rym: And then what they would do is take the air rifle out and demonstrate it.

471
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:45,080
Rym: Now these Indians knew about rifles and muskets, but they didn't know about air rifles.

472
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:51,449
Rym: so he'd basically stand there and go pop pop just destroying a whole bunch of stuff in a demonstration.

473
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:57,789
Rym: and basically as far as the Indians were concerned this rifle had infinite ammo and could shoot forever with almost no sound and kill everybody.

474
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:04,750
Rym: and They they used this and credited it as the reason why the Indians left them alone because they were afraid of these weapons.

475
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:07,745
Rym: They thought that they had a ton of these things when really they just had one.

476
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:11,605
Rym: Uh-huh It's a neat bit of history and that's all I got to say.

477
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:15,460
Scott: those sites Um, someone actually has that exact rifle.

478
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,170
Scott: No, not like a copy of it, but that particular one.

479
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:22,070
Rym: No, they have the exact same model, but it isn't the one that Lewis and Clark.

480
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:30,431
Scott: No one has the one now, but it's the same model pretty much Uh-huh, then how do we actually know they had one if we don't have that one cuz they wrote about it Uh-huh.

481
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:35,707
Rym: In fact every time they mention it they also talk about how they scared some Indian tribe or other with it.

482
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:37,541
Rym: Uh-huh It's neat stuff.

483
00:30:37,926 --> 00:30:42,316
Scott: All right So this is a video Much less involved, right?

484
00:30:42,777 --> 00:30:49,601
Scott: It is a the first performance ever of the hit song smack my bitch up in Night back my bitch up.

485
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,365
Scott: You don't know this song.

486
00:30:50,406 --> 00:30:51,050
Rym: I don't know that song.

487
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,792
Rym: That's a famous song.

488
00:30:51,873 --> 00:30:54,040
Scott: Anyway is the first performance of it ever.

489
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,444
Scott: who did it in 1965?

490
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:57,170
Scott: That's a good question.

491
00:30:58,214 --> 00:31:01,896
Rym: All right, I don't know Who sang the song in 1965.

492
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:08,538
Scott: Oh in 1965, yeah Someone else other than who actually sang it.

493
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,826
Scott: that is the joke of the video.

494
00:31:10,846 --> 00:31:14,456
Rym: All right Are you gonna let on?

495
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:16,023
Rym: are we just gonna leave it be?

496
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:17,630
Scott: it's really not that complex a joke.

497
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,898
Scott: So there's really if I say it, there's no reason to watch the video.

498
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:29,564
Rym: Okay, and of course the meta moment We will be not this weekend But next weekend at the penny arcade Expo bitch packs in East.

499
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:34,179
Rym: March 11 12th and 13th We will be doing five panels and three panel rooms.

500
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,002
Scott: Oh shit.

501
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:41,913
Rym: Yep, Friday night and then two on Sunday All right, and also the weekend immediately after that March 19th and 20th.

502
00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:46,010
Rym: We won't be there on the 18th Zenkai Khan anime con in the Philly area.

503
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,837
Rym: We will be there doing bunch of panels.

504
00:31:47,858 --> 00:31:48,601
Rym: I gotta look up what.

505
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:50,890
Rym: when are we supposed to do laundry and then write those panels?

506
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:57,805
Rym: I took the day before we leave for packs off to do all my stuff And of course announcing this for people who didn't catch it.

507
00:31:57,906 --> 00:31:58,450
Rym: It's a ways off.

508
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,947
Rym: But in April we will definitely be at the anime Boston like we go to every year.

509
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:03,670
Rym: We've confirmed it.

510
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:12,289
Scott: Yeah And before panels and I think a couple week or two before anime Boston I forget the exact date is the Museum of comic and cartoon art festival, which you should all go to.

511
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:12,590
Rym: we will.

512
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:13,276
Rym: We will be attendees.

513
00:32:15,613 --> 00:32:17,684
Scott: In other words no sleep till May.

514
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:21,216
Scott: Yeah That's it's no sleep till May.

515
00:32:21,337 --> 00:32:24,790
Rym: the book club book, which we're just waiting for Scott to finish reading is Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

516
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:30,970
Rym: I'll be reading that pretty soon And you should join the GeekNights forum because a lot of you have been joining lately and it's pretty fucking rocking in there.

517
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:43,630
Rym: Yeah, especially especially if you are a fan of the my little ponies, maybe I have a special Intrudy to all of you Rainbow Dash is clearly the best my little pony but yet of late.

518
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:45,979
Scott: Well, the best friendship is magic my little pony.

519
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:47,967
Rym: Well, that's the only my little pony as far as I'm.

520
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:50,877
Rym: yeah But there's been trouble lately.

521
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:54,066
Rym: these Fluttershy fanatics and these Pinkie Pie.

522
00:32:54,147 --> 00:32:56,615
Rym: I don't have a word for them Are encroaching.

523
00:32:56,635 --> 00:33:05,570
Rym: Yeah, so if you truly love Rainbow Dash Like all true men do get into the forum and vote in our which my little pony pony is the best pony poll.

524
00:33:08,714 --> 00:33:09,949
Scott: Every pony vote Rainbow Dash.

525
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,718
Rym: Some model rockets something more manly.

526
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:18,470
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, this is sort of like we're running out of Monday ideas.

527
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,539
Scott: So if anyone's Monday ideas send them on over.

528
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,985
Rym: but plenty of Monday ID.

529
00:33:22,046 --> 00:33:23,914
Rym: No, you just don't want to do Shit for Monday.

530
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:25,099
Rym: I got plenty of nothing.

531
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:25,501
Scott: Yeah.

532
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:25,822
Scott: Yeah.

533
00:33:25,862 --> 00:33:26,485
Scott: What's name one?

534
00:33:26,686 --> 00:33:31,908
Rym: Let's talk about Advice for me to you since you're doing more IT and you know cuz I'm doing CS.

535
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:35,939
Scott: stupid Stupid because I know I know everything I need to know.

536
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:37,164
Rym: Yeah, do you do?

537
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:37,806
Scott: Yes.

538
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:38,769
Rym: How do you set up NTP?

539
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,950
Scott: It's already installed.

540
00:33:43,252 --> 00:33:45,580
Scott: I have to get install NTP done.

541
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:47,245
Rym: that actually doesn't configure it.

542
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:48,028
Rym: It won't work that way.

543
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:48,650
Rym: I was on Ubuntu.

544
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:51,257
Rym: Actually, it connects to shitty time sources.

545
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:54,690
Scott: if you do that it doesn't matter because I don't need the precise time that you need.

546
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:55,824
Rym: How do you know you don't?

547
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,700
Scott: Because I know I'm running a web server.

548
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,670
Scott: I'm not running whatever anyway.

549
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:03,058
Scott: So we figure hey model rockets.

550
00:34:03,098 --> 00:34:05,590
Scott: that would sort of feel like a Thursday show, but it's science.

551
00:34:05,971 --> 00:34:07,097
Scott: So we'll make it a Monday show.

552
00:34:07,157 --> 00:34:10,010
Rym: take that I would argue that it's more engineering.

553
00:34:10,811 --> 00:34:18,310
Rym: Yeah, probably but I'm gonna make a controversial statement right now And then I'm going to sidestep it and not talk about it again until the end of this episode.

554
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,214
Scott: All right, mr.

555
00:34:19,254 --> 00:34:19,897
Scott: Controversy.

556
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,226
Rym: I was really big in the model rocketry as a kid.

557
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:23,050
Rym: I went to space camp.

558
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:30,330
Scott: I wasn't big in the model rocketry, but I did it, you know I went to a bunch of summer camp right and I also did did it once an actual shop class at school.

559
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,760
Scott: So I've done quite a few of the rockets.

560
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,186
Rym: Oh, I owned all the equipment.

561
00:34:34,226 --> 00:34:35,170
Rym: I had my own launch pad.

562
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:35,656
Scott: I didn't.

563
00:34:35,737 --> 00:34:42,569
Scott: I didn't actually own any stuff but I done it at many camps over many wide array of different rockets I'd built and played with.

564
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:54,899
Rym: but My controversial statement is as such I feel that model rocketry As it is practiced by the majority of the people in the u.s Who practice it is not educational in any meaningful way.

565
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,950
Rym: nor is it in any way a preparation for science or math education?

566
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,894
Scott: No, I don't think so either.

567
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:04,830
Rym: I think at best it's an expensive and slightly dangerous toy for most people.

568
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:10,125
Scott: I think it's pretty much the equivalent of Gundam models in terms of a hobby.

569
00:35:10,226 --> 00:35:10,787
Scott: It's not a bad.

570
00:35:10,828 --> 00:35:13,126
Scott: It's not a bad hobby It's not harmful, but it is not.

571
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:26,729
Rym: At least basic model rocketry like they have at summer camp or school is not helping you become a rocket scientist at all Or any kind of scientist, but so Scott, uh How many rockets did you ever launch that you were able to retrieve?

572
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:28,795
Scott: Uh, I think all of them.

573
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:30,602
Rym: really yeah, I lost about 75% of my rockets.

574
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:34,589
Scott: Well, I mean, did you do like the double stage guys?

575
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:40,030
Rym: I did very large rockets because I grew up in Michigan where the laws were much laxer than they are.

576
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,454
Scott: I've done him in Pennsylvania.

577
00:35:41,494 --> 00:35:42,257
Scott: I've done him in New York.

578
00:35:42,277 --> 00:35:44,343
Rym: I've done the biggest engine you ever used.

579
00:35:44,805 --> 00:35:49,199
Rym: see see see really Yeah, see it's like the baby engine.

580
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:51,868
Scott: the baby engine was a double-a triple-a.

581
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:54,765
Scott: I never seen double-a or triple-a.

582
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:55,370
Scott: It was ABC.

583
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:56,875
Scott: No one ever used anything less.

584
00:35:57,116 --> 00:35:59,504
Scott: and one guy really wanted to use II but they didn't let.

585
00:35:59,544 --> 00:36:01,632
Rym: him is even legal in Connecticut I don't know.

586
00:36:01,672 --> 00:36:02,476
Scott: It wasn't in Connecticut.

587
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:03,340
Scott: It was in Pennsylvania.

588
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,390
Rym: I've only ever used the engines a few times.

589
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,203
Rym: I was very I liked them, but I didn't do them on my own.

590
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:08,665
Rym: I had helped.

591
00:36:08,705 --> 00:36:12,570
Rym: I did them like in events But these were pretty much my go-to engine.

592
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:17,710
Rym: So I'd make these rockets that I was trying to send them into orbit and I don't know if they got there.

593
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,117
Scott: No, I mean the basic.

594
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:21,570
Rym: one time I bought the transponder and I was waiting.

595
00:36:23,152 --> 00:36:23,935
Scott: What a waste of money.

596
00:36:24,236 --> 00:36:25,961
Rym: I figured alright, I'll lose my rocket.

597
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:31,434
Rym: Then I'll go find it and I shoot it and the transponder goes And I never found it.

598
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:38,094
Scott: good job, you know, but really it was annoying even sometimes even if I was able to retrieve the rocket Which is most of the time.

599
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:40,304
Scott: Yeah, the parachute didn't always work.

600
00:36:40,384 --> 00:36:41,167
Scott: It worked about 50% of the time.

601
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,577
Rym: That means you packed it poorly.

602
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:52,730
Scott: So if some pony doesn't know how to pack a proper parachute so 50% of the time the parachute wouldn't eject and What happened was he would basically just go nose going first.

603
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:57,530
Rym: You're using the rock kind of engines right because you realize like plug engines don't have the ejection charge.

604
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,278
Scott: I they all had the ejection charge.

605
00:36:59,399 --> 00:36:59,881
Rym: Are you sure?

606
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:01,670
Rym: Yeah, what's the ejection plug in the top?

607
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:04,795
Rym: Did you put wadding in?

608
00:37:04,996 --> 00:37:06,100
Scott: Yeah, you always did the wadding.

609
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,923
Rym: How much wadding?

610
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:07,826
Scott: I don't know.

611
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:08,870
Rym: Did you pack it in real tight?

612
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:10,575
Scott: I don't remember.

613
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,466
Rym: Because if you pack it in real tight, it might not blow.

614
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:12,567
Scott: I do.

615
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:16,556
Scott: I definitely use the wadding all the time.

616
00:37:16,677 --> 00:37:19,225
Rym: Anyway, did you pack the parachute properly?

617
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:20,570
Scott: Yeah, you tie it up with a rubber band.

618
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:22,116
Scott: No, God no.

619
00:37:22,377 --> 00:37:24,204
Rym: If you tie it up with a rubber band, it's not gonna work.

620
00:37:24,987 --> 00:37:25,710
Rym: How's it gonna open?

621
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,013
Scott: No, you would.

622
00:37:28,234 --> 00:37:30,750
Scott: no you didn't actually tie the rubber band around the parachute.

623
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:37,955
Scott: What you did is you you had you cut the rubber band and you attach the rubber band from the parachute to the nose cone Right on the inside.

624
00:37:38,397 --> 00:37:41,289
Rym: You attach it to the inside of the tube not to the nose cone.

625
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:44,770
Scott: I think that I'm trying to remember.

626
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,379
Scott: I think the rubber band goes to all three because it connect.

627
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:50,750
Scott: the rubber band connects the tube to the nose cone.

628
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:51,372
Scott: Oh, I'm sorry.

629
00:37:51,392 --> 00:37:53,178
Rym: You were an Estes kid.

630
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:56,530
Rym: I used quest components because they were far superior.

631
00:37:56,851 --> 00:38:05,329
Scott: Actually, right, you know most of the time when I built one at like say regular old summer camp or in school They just bought Estes kits and we're just like follow the instructions kids.

632
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:08,342
Scott: But and when I went to real nerd summer camp, right?

633
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:10,210
Scott: There was no kits involved.

634
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:15,610
Scott: They basically had just tubes and nose cones and fins and all these parts everywhere.

635
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:18,443
Scott: You just built whatever you came up with.

636
00:38:18,483 --> 00:38:19,106
Scott: There was no kit.

637
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:19,950
Scott: No instructions.

638
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,070
Scott: It was just go nuts, but they did force you to build.

639
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,370
Scott: Basically, basically what they did is they would they would ration out the parts, right?

640
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,910
Scott: So you if you went in we're like, I want to build like a three-stage monstrosity.

641
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:37,838
Scott: They'd be like, uh-uh, and they would give you the parts for basically what was known as a wizard Which is basically the smallest possible rocket.

642
00:38:37,998 --> 00:38:39,864
Rym: The wizard is a specific Estes one.

643
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:40,306
Scott: Is it?

644
00:38:40,326 --> 00:38:41,530
Scott: Yeah, they call this shit.

645
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:43,070
Rym: It's like the basic baby rocket.

646
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:51,980
Scott: They basically gave you the parts for you know The smallest baby rocket and they said build that and if you finish it and it works Then we'll let we'll let you get what other parts.

647
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,050
Rym: it takes less than two minutes to make the wizard.

648
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,014
Scott: Well, they forced you to.

649
00:38:56,135 --> 00:38:57,501
Scott: actually the thing is they forced you to.

650
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:58,384
Scott: it was basically trying to.

651
00:38:58,405 --> 00:39:02,446
Scott: it was a barrier to entry Right, so they forced you to paint it properly.

652
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:08,790
Scott: spray paint Yeah They basically forced you to do the job right and they examined it to make sure that you actually cared.

653
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,849
Rym: I never made my rockets look good.

654
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:12,937
Rym: Yeah but you realize if you get they just wanted.

655
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:14,484
Scott: they didn't have to look good asked it.

656
00:39:14,504 --> 00:39:16,556
Scott: they just wanted to prove that you were Putting in the work.

657
00:39:16,596 --> 00:39:21,856
Scott: and then if you put the work in and you were serious Then they would let you get more parts Special.

658
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:33,910
Rym: if you give them that freedom and like you give even simple parts Like let them make a rocket and you don't force them to make a specific design They will think to themselves that lighter rocket plus bigger engine equals higher.

659
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:34,833
Rym: So they'll.

660
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:39,829
Rym: so I knew many kids who would basically glue nose cones and fins to an engine.

661
00:39:41,992 --> 00:39:45,590
Rym: Let me tell you that goes about five feet up spins around and come straight back at you.

662
00:39:47,195 --> 00:39:49,550
Scott: No, but I mean because of the way they did things, right?

663
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:57,250
Scott: The only people were actually able to make anything cool or people who are like dedicated to it Right and they and if anyone is making something with more than a stage, right?

664
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,930
Scott: They would always like examine to make sure you weren't making something stupid.

665
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,035
Scott: They'd be like, no you can't do that.

666
00:40:02,216 --> 00:40:03,522
Scott: or the thing was they had.

667
00:40:03,622 --> 00:40:04,144
Scott: it wasn't like.

668
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:05,350
Scott: you just launched when you were done.

669
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,410
Scott: They had launch day twice at camp.

670
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:12,070
Scott: So every four weeks if you built three rockets, you'd get to launch three times on launch day, right?

671
00:40:12,571 --> 00:40:19,495
Scott: But on launch day you would basically walk up to the launch pad with the rocket as everyone was sitting there and they would Look at it and they would.

672
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:21,286
Scott: they would make a spot judgment.

673
00:40:21,326 --> 00:40:21,909
Scott: Yes or no?

674
00:40:22,351 --> 00:40:25,723
Scott: And if you made a stupid rocket, they just say no, so you got a fudged you got a.

675
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:27,550
Rym: I made rockets that would explode.

676
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:29,733
Rym: They'd get up.

677
00:40:29,893 --> 00:40:30,998
Rym: first stage second stage.

678
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:31,540
Scott: Boom.

679
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:33,226
Scott: Yeah, I mean the most ridiculous.

680
00:40:33,246 --> 00:40:34,210
Scott: they wouldn't allow that to go.

681
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,490
Scott: The one thing is gonna hide it in there one kid.

682
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,563
Scott: They knew what you were doing though because they observed everybody.

683
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:40,650
Scott: It was a little tiny rocket hut.

684
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:44,590
Scott: They had a special hut the rocket hut and all the rocketing went got went on in the hut.

685
00:40:44,853 --> 00:40:46,330
Scott: So they watched you rocketing in the hut.

686
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:54,154
Rym: You couldn't rock it outside the hut one kid I remember at Starbase filled his with gravel because he thought like you get up there and just for gravel and everybody but the fuck it Didn't even take off.

687
00:40:54,195 --> 00:40:59,577
Rym: It basically got halfway up the launch pole like Hovered and then came back down.

688
00:40:59,638 --> 00:41:01,649
Rym: the parachute went pop and some gravel went.

689
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,769
Rym: Yeah, and like one pebble fell out and then the kid got sent home.

690
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:10,450
Scott: Anyway, the the most ridiculous thing I ever saw though was this guy.

691
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,905
Scott: He basically made a gigantic rocket like as tall as a person.

692
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:14,990
Rym: Yeah, I made one like that.

693
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,765
Scott: It was like it was a tube that I could put my leg through.

694
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:18,550
Scott: It was a giant tube.

695
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:21,577
Rym: What kind of engines did he use?

696
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:24,149
Rym: that's like it because that was the interesting part of rocketry.

697
00:41:24,169 --> 00:41:26,038
Rym: for me It was when you made the ones that use multiple.

698
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:26,902
Scott: that was the guy.

699
00:41:26,963 --> 00:41:28,872
Scott: that was the guy who used the e engine Right.

700
00:41:28,932 --> 00:41:32,949
Scott: So just one e. I don't know if it was just one e but I know there was definitely least one e involved.

701
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,970
Scott: There may have been a ring of other engines around it and I didn't look very closely.

702
00:41:37,271 --> 00:41:38,877
Rym: It was difficult to set those off properly.

703
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:39,981
Rym: You needed the multi-stagers.

704
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:40,423
Rym: I know

705
00:41:40,564 --> 00:42:01,395
Scott: I didn't know who that it wasn't multi-stage It was just one big tube with the biggest fins and the biggest cone and he spray-painted actually really nicely and it sat on The on the porch in front of his cabin for like as soon as he for me the time He finished it to the end of camp and on the last day of camp or the second last day before the parents showed up It was the final launch day and he brought it out there Basically all the rockets.

706
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:06,132
Scott: they put them out on display and they just grab them one at a time to decide if they're gonna launch Or not.

707
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:14,726
Scott: and he was sitting out there ready to launch right and at one point They went over and picked it up and they tried to slide it on to the launch pad and they stay.

708
00:42:14,787 --> 00:42:22,190
Scott: all the counselors were Like discussing and they were like, hmm and you could tell the kid He sort of wanted to do it and he sort of didn't want to do it.

709
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,736
Scott: He's like he wanted to for awesome.

710
00:42:23,997 --> 00:42:30,366
Scott: Yeah, but he also didn't want to because it probably would not have survived Right or just you know, and it was all so they have.

711
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,909
Scott: in the end They were like hesitant and then they didn't do it.

712
00:42:33,452 --> 00:42:35,059
Scott: Ah, but it was like this thing was.

713
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,773
Scott: it was like it was at least four or five feet tall If not six feet tall.

714
00:42:38,854 --> 00:42:40,218
Scott: it was big real big.

715
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:43,830
Scott: and uh, every kid wanted to see it go if it because it wasn't theirs.

716
00:42:44,551 --> 00:42:45,595
Scott: Right, they didn't work on it.

717
00:42:45,635 --> 00:42:49,369
Scott: Yeah, but it would have made might have killed someone because we were sitting pretty close.

718
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:51,702
Rym: So I think it would have been fine.

719
00:42:51,722 --> 00:42:52,307
Rym: It was pretty dangerous.

720
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:58,429
Rym: You realize it seems like you were using all the Estes stuff because the rubber bandy crab That's that's kind of like the hallmark of cheapo Estes.

721
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,254
Scott: Well, I never.

722
00:42:59,274 --> 00:43:02,490
Scott: I was never you know at the level where they would let me do it because I didn't you know.

723
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:08,455
Scott: I dedicated my time at some other areas of the camp like the computer area and the Area and the hockey area.

724
00:43:08,475 --> 00:43:16,878
Rym: so I would sell more like components like design a rocket and the individual components were higher Quality like that have better seals.

725
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:26,230
Rym: or the biggest one is the nose cone would be connected Root like through the tube to the base of the rocket with a teflon cord or a Kevlar core.

726
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,310
Scott: Yeah, I think yeah if you you know, they had all these the base.

727
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,690
Scott: I think they might have had just quest and Estes parts at the good camp, right?

728
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:35,170
Scott: Most of the all the other camps just bought an Estes kit and handed to you in the bag still.

729
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:37,150
Scott: But at the good camp, right?

730
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:49,049
Scott: I think they just said every component imaginable like this tons of them of every shape and size and they definitely had you know The teflon cord and they had fancier nose cones and they had like multi-stage release tubes and all sorts of it.

731
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,657
Scott: Also different shapes of fins you could get.

732
00:43:52,138 --> 00:43:53,503
Scott: they would even like make parts like.

733
00:43:53,523 --> 00:43:57,678
Scott: they would go and buy balsa wood and go To the wood shop and cut out fins.

734
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,949
Scott: Yeah, that's how the kid got the giant fins for the.

735
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:01,669
Rym: you know That was the interesting part for me too.

736
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:07,183
Rym: Is that when you did the more advanced rockets like I would make fins you sand them down and paint them and then they look Terrible because I was bad at that.

737
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,775
Scott: Yeah At least you could.

738
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:14,110
Scott: even it wasn't too hard to do them all identically with a bandsaw though But even if they were all they just all be equally ugly.

739
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:17,306
Rym: Yeah But then you got to shape them and it's not so easy gonna sand them down to where they're.

740
00:44:17,326 --> 00:44:19,134
Rym: like thick at the front they Come to a point at the bottom.

741
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:26,249
Scott: Yeah, but if you what you do is you clamp them all together, you know identically The whole times that they're all gonna be the same.

742
00:44:26,672 --> 00:44:28,381
Rym: But then you have to sand them down and make the shape.

743
00:44:28,421 --> 00:44:29,709
Scott: you sand them while they're clamped.

744
00:44:30,131 --> 00:44:31,921
Rym: Uh, you can't say that wouldn't work.

745
00:44:31,941 --> 00:44:32,605
Scott: What do you mean?

746
00:44:32,725 --> 00:44:33,168
Rym: How are you getting?

747
00:44:33,188 --> 00:44:33,470
Rym: it's a fin?

748
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,530
Rym: There's two sides and it's a three-dimensional surface and you have four of them.

749
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,590
Rym: Are you gonna sand them all at the same time to be identical?

750
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:40,411
Scott: Well, no You'll.

751
00:44:40,451 --> 00:44:47,319
Scott: you send the the edges right while they're all clamped and then when you actually want to send the two faces You have to unclamp it obviously.

752
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,594
Rym: Yeah, but the faces are anyway It's.

753
00:44:50,776 --> 00:44:51,807
Rym: you can't just do it like that.

754
00:44:53,072 --> 00:44:58,114
Rym: But I think my trouble with model rocketry is that like like you said of this camp, you know They give you a kit you build it and it goes.

755
00:44:58,736 --> 00:45:17,890
Rym: very few children actually get to the point of experimenting and Trying to learn from their experiments or trying to actually chart a trajectory or thinking things like alright I want to launch a rocket to accomplish X So I'll use an a engine with in the first stage with this characteristic cuz remember the numbers.

756
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:19,229
Scott: That's true at no point.

757
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:25,007
Scott: But did anyone ever discuss like any sort of math or physics in relation to the model rocketry?

758
00:45:25,388 --> 00:45:30,450
Scott: at no point Did anyone discuss like, you know any correlation between actually trying to do something?

759
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,522
Scott: It's pretty much just like a fun activity like building.

760
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:38,225
Scott: Like I said building a Gundam robot It was like, you know follow the instructions make something and then it's fun when you get to launch it.

761
00:45:38,265 --> 00:45:39,008
Scott: Yay.

762
00:45:39,068 --> 00:45:39,530
Scott: It's fun.

763
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:46,650
Scott: There was no learning or education in terms of you know, you know any sort of rocket science.

764
00:45:46,851 --> 00:45:52,650
Rym: It usually wasn't even engineering because the kid no matter how shittily you built it They'd all launch about the same.

765
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:56,510
Scott: It was mostly right is the number one priority was pretty much safety.

766
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:06,009
Scott: Right because these all these camps and stuff had liability issues in schools All right and I never knew anyone who did it like on their spare time on their own where they would actually experiment or anything like that.

767
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:14,719
Scott: and After safety, it was pretty much just like, you know, it's basically the equivalent of arts and crafts, you know It was like make the rocket have fun making it don't.

768
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:17,630
Scott: there was no at any point ever any education.

769
00:46:18,472 --> 00:46:28,954
Scott: It was you know, it was pretty much all we knew is a bigger letters, you know And everyone kids would be like man, I'll gonna make a rocket that used the 5z engine And then they would.

770
00:46:29,015 --> 00:46:34,700
Scott: some kids would be like all the space shuttle the white ones on the side or s and the big red One is you know, I'd be like what.

771
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:36,089
Scott: I don't think that it works that way.

772
00:46:37,234 --> 00:46:41,110
Scott: I don't think the NASA's like yeah get the s engines out for the space shuttle.

773
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:48,750
Rym: So, how do we make model rocketry, um a worthwhile endeavor other than just arts and crafts.

774
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:52,010
Scott: Well, I think what you know in the kit right because it's always gonna be kids.

775
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,809
Scott: You're not gonna be able to deliver it without kids, right?

776
00:46:54,270 --> 00:47:03,628
Rym: so in the I think you could if you're like if you're if you're a counselor at a camp that was willing to let you Do it you basically assemble all the component parts and kind of as a class design rockets.

777
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:04,330
Rym: Yeah, sure.

778
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:08,130
Scott: But the thing is if you're gonna deliver it in a wide scale, right?

779
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:13,360
Scott: You need to deliver it in kit form right to get any sort of traction and you know At least for the entry level.

780
00:47:13,441 --> 00:47:14,590
Rym: Well, there's two and what you need to do?

781
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,743
Rym: There's the there's the the entry level mass-market like, you know kit thing.

782
00:47:18,924 --> 00:47:24,650
Rym: So you gotta start with the entry level Yeah, but there's also the focused instruction like rich kid camp, right?

783
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:25,352
Scott: But where are you gonna?

784
00:47:25,493 --> 00:47:27,520
Scott: you need focused instructors and there are many.

785
00:47:27,621 --> 00:47:30,130
Scott: so yeah, you can't have enough instructors.

786
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:35,440
Scott: So you need to do is in the kit itself Don't just include the instructions and how to stop.

787
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,567
Rym: they all included all the math and science.

788
00:47:37,627 --> 00:47:39,052
Rym: No one paid attention to it Really?

789
00:47:39,113 --> 00:47:39,877
Scott: Yeah, no one.

790
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:48,290
Rym: No, I never saw any math or science got I know instructions from Estes that explain everything you needed to know about making rockets how to balance them different.

791
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:50,538
Scott: Well, I think the problem is simple.

792
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,586
Scott: Let the kids see that goddamn book is.

793
00:47:52,706 --> 00:47:53,650
Scott: I didn't know that book existed.

794
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:54,275
Scott: I never saw it.

795
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:56,050
Scott: No one ever showed that book.

796
00:47:56,191 --> 00:48:05,874
Rym: I don't blame the creators of the Mass-market products and while I like quest better quest failed and Estes still is around as far as I can tell you just need to Show that book to the kids.

797
00:48:06,135 --> 00:48:07,480
Scott: That's pretty much all it comes down to.

798
00:48:07,741 --> 00:48:10,050
Scott: but even there have the person in charge read the book.

799
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:10,251
Scott: Yeah,

800
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:24,001
Rym: it's that the instructors at camps and things even at Space Academy and you know space camp and star base in these programs I went to they did even if they knew rocketry they didn't care and most of them were kind of Nerds who actually cared mostly about the appearance.

801
00:48:24,021 --> 00:48:42,903
Rym: They'd make like the one shaped like an x-wing Yeah, as opposed to the one that teaches a valuable lesson Like what if you want to make one that's going to fly up take a picture at its apex and then launch the parachute you know having a kid calculate what kinds of engines and what waiting and what delays and what fin Configurations and how to aim it in the wind where the apex will be right.

802
00:48:43,425 --> 00:48:46,409
Rym: That's the interesting stuff But no one ever presents it in that manner.

803
00:48:46,852 --> 00:48:52,020
Scott: Well, there are people who work on model rockets right in that manner But you know, it's much like you.

804
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,230
Scott: look at RC cars, right?

805
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:57,704
Scott: There's people who buy an RC car Tycho and there's some people who make one that's gas-powered right.

806
00:48:57,844 --> 00:49:03,998
Scott: or there's some people who make Model air, you know a model airplane, you know Like the helicopter from Radio Shack and the.

807
00:49:04,018 --> 00:49:06,510
Scott: some people make a model airplane for reals, right?

808
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,530
Scott: So model rocketry is the same way.

809
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:18,335
Scott: Most people are doing these kits at summer camp But then you got like John Carmack who's making rockets that are metal and have rocket fuel in them, you know and so there are not.

810
00:49:19,037 --> 00:49:25,579
Scott: I guess there are some kids into the serious model rocketry also, but there are Serious model rocketry hobbyists that do exist.

811
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:29,310
Scott: Yep, and they actually are really doing model rocketry for reals.

812
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:34,350
Scott: It's just that's not being exposed to children or anyone else on a wide scale.

813
00:49:35,331 --> 00:49:39,423
Scott: It's it's very a small a much smaller hobby than RC car.

814
00:49:39,463 --> 00:49:41,890
Rym: I also worry that the hobby is getting even smaller.

815
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,409
Rym: I feel like liability concerns are taking it out of schools.

816
00:49:45,092 --> 00:49:50,952
Rym: I feel like just like New York has kind of restrictive laws on different levels of engines and everything and yeah It's kind of.

817
00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:56,270
Rym: it's a hobby that I think is going to largely disappear from the anything that children have access to.

818
00:49:57,171 --> 00:49:59,888
Rym: Independent of the problems that the hobby has I feel like it's gonna go away.

819
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,522
Scott: I don't know if it'll go away completely not completely.

820
00:50:02,543 --> 00:50:03,085
Rym: It'll still be it's.

821
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:03,910
Scott: I think it's pretty much.

822
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:05,055
Scott: I think it's gonna hold steady.

823
00:50:05,075 --> 00:50:06,722
Scott: I just where it is, which is low.

824
00:50:07,766 --> 00:50:08,710
Rym: I think it'll decline.

825
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:14,746
Rym: I think a lot of just adults are afraid to teach children about it partly because they're afraid of terrorism stuff.

826
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:19,923
Scott: on a vague level I mean, I worry more about the RC planes and RC cars than the.

827
00:50:19,943 --> 00:50:21,970
Rym: I wouldn't give a kid an RC plane or an hour.

828
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:22,894
Rym: Maybe an RC car.

829
00:50:23,116 --> 00:50:24,020
Scott: Well a plastic one.

830
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:30,100
Scott: Yeah, not a real one Anyway, but yeah, I guess model rocketry.

831
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:31,525
Scott: It's you know, I guess it was sort of.

832
00:50:31,646 --> 00:50:32,950
Scott: it's it's like when we were kids.

833
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,855
Scott: It was sort of big.

834
00:50:33,916 --> 00:50:36,350
Scott: it was it wasn't huge, but it was always sort of there.

835
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:44,007
Rym: I remember I used to go to local hobby shops and they'd have just like every Isles of them every hobby shop and Toys R Us had them when I was a kid.

836
00:50:44,047 --> 00:50:46,910
Rym: Yep sure did I haven't been to a Toys R Us in a while.

837
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,801
Rym: I feel like I should go and see if they have model rockets or not.

838
00:50:48,821 --> 00:50:51,816
Scott: I even think you can find them at craft stores too Like, you know, not a good one.

839
00:50:51,876 --> 00:50:52,860
Rym: I wonder if you still can.

840
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,370
Scott: Yeah, I've seen it in a craft store kind of recently ish.

841
00:50:56,031 --> 00:50:57,310
Scott: But yeah, it's sort of like this thing.

842
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:04,766
Scott: It was always sort of there But it didn't have any staying power, you know, and I just happened to go to a weird nerd science camp Where they had a rocket hut.

843
00:51:04,888 --> 00:51:11,962
Rym: Yep I happen to live next to the Southridge Air National Guard base and they had programs where they teach kids about Military and science and space stuff.

844
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:13,310
Rym: so we'd make a lot of rockets there.

845
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:14,789
Scott: Yeah, but I mean that was pretty much it.

846
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:24,673
Scott: it was like, you know, and then once you're out of you know, I don't know a single person who did it on their own outside of a Official Regulated setting.

847
00:51:24,694 --> 00:51:27,890
Rym: Yeah, I did a lot but it was never signed.

848
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:31,517
Rym: You just built him at home and said I build him at home And then I had all the equipment.

849
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:36,248
Rym: me and my brother would go to a park big football field or something And we'd launch him and lose him and they'd be the end of it.

850
00:51:37,453 --> 00:51:44,928
Rym: All right, as they flew off over the horizon sometimes you see the parachute deploy and they'd catch a headwind and just Bye.

851
00:51:44,988 --> 00:51:45,252
Rym: Bye.

852
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:51,120
Scott: Yeah Anyway, those are those are good days and you know, they're probably gone.

853
00:51:56,273 --> 00:51:58,810
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

854
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:03,670
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

855
00:52:03,911 --> 00:52:05,898
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

856
00:52:05,938 --> 00:52:08,930
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

857
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:16,609
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:24,501
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

860
00:52:24,681 --> 00:52:26,166
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

861
00:52:26,286 --> 00:52:27,570
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
