00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,053
Rym: It's Tuesday, January 25th, 2011, I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:22,250
Rym: Tonight we bring you our coverage of Magfest 9.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,228
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,350
Rym: So this is a bit of a departure from our normal GeekNights schedule.

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,470
Rym: We've got no things of the day.

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,270
Rym: This episode might sound a little odd, we didn't use our normal studio recording techniques because we actually did this show in front of some cameras.

7
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:45,890
Rym: It's nothing special, the video may or may not appear in the near future, but that will explain any audio discrepancies compared to our usual show.

8
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:54,630
Rym: If you're a new listener, this is a slightly atypical episode, we're just going to talk about Magfest, a rather awesome convention we attended recently, and that's about it.

9
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,188
Rym: I think I'll just get right into the meat of it because we talk about the con for quite a while.

10
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,656
Rym: So we heard about it for years, but we never actually went to Magfest.

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,760
Scott: Well it's because they were stupid, they had it on New Year's Eve, it's like who the hell is going to give up their New Year's Eve to go to almost any convention?

12
00:01:09,341 --> 00:01:11,540
Scott: What convention could possibly be on New Year's Eve that you'd still go?

13
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:12,298
Rym: I would go to PAX.

14
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,760
Scott: I don't think I would go to New Year's Eve.

15
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:15,299
Rym: I would go to one New Year's PAX.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,898
Scott: It depends on where the PAX was.

17
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:17,780
Rym: Seattle.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,620
Scott: I don't know if I'd go to Seattle in New Year's Eve.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,220
Rym: You wouldn't go to Seattle for PAX on New Year's Eve?

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,220
Rym: Imagine the craziness.

21
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:22,896
Scott: No, I don't know.

22
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:24,159
Scott: It'd be a close call.

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,690
Rym: So Magfest we ignored every year just because, well before I didn't even know it existed, like I vaguely heard.

24
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:30,540
Rym: oh there's something called Magfest.

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:42,359
Scott: I knew there was a convention called Magfest, I knew it was a gaming con, it was mostly video game oriented, and that it also had the video game music, but it wasn't large in my brain, it was just a convention I knew existed.

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,980
Scott: It was like 100 conventions, I know they exist.

27
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,309
Rym: I think what it really came to light was they had John St.

28
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,832
Rym: John in their ad.

29
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:51,760
Scott: That was one or two years ago, right?

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,524
Scott: They had John St.

31
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:55,246
Scott: John in the ad and they made that awesome YouTube video to promote it.

32
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,538
Rym: And I was like oh, Magfest.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,711
Scott: What it was is that it wasn't that I thought the convention was somehow better, it's that that ad.

34
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:08,939
Scott: let me know that the people at that convention running it were very culturally similar to us.

35
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,680
Scott: They were our people.

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,880
Rym: What really got me though was when it was explained to me that there was an official yell of Magfest.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,456
Rym: The colossus.

38
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,478
Scott: Well that was only apparently invented last year.

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,220
Scott: That was only invented last year.

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,717
Rym: But we heard about it last year and suddenly that seemed like the kind of thing that we would dig.

41
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:23,920
Rym: And that was correct.

42
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,460
Scott: It became very apparent in the past year or two that Magfest was our style.

43
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,340
Rym: So this year they actually came to us and said hey, you guys want to come to Magfest, be guests, do a panel, do your usual thing, the stuff you do at all the other cons?

44
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:37,634
Rym: And we said yes because it wasn't on New Years.

45
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:41,200
Scott: Yeah, I mean if it was on New Years again I would have said no, but we said yes.

46
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,480
Rym: Now many of you might be new listeners and you're trying to check out like alright, we're doing this review of Magfest.

47
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,420
Rym: I was at Magfest, I want to see what you have to say.

48
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,660
Rym: We're very harsh on conventions.

49
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,219
Rym: We often complain about all the things that go wrong with them because a lot of conventions do things very badly.

50
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,118
Scott: Because that's the only interesting thing to talk about a lot of the time is what went wrong.

51
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:02,400
Scott: If you talk about what went right, it's like well, this was fun, and this was fun, and Of course, it's a new con.

52
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,020
Rym: I mean how many Otakons did we cover?

53
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,705
Rym: How many times can you say the artist alley is this big and there's this many people in it?

54
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:16,140
Rym: So what we're going to do is start with all the bad parts of Magfest, get all the complaining out of the way so we can talk about the good stuff because there was some bad.

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,580
Rym: There was quite a bit of bad.

56
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,397
Rym: In fact, there was a portent.

57
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:20,959
Scott: There was indeed a quite smelly portent.

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,560
Rym: We're excited.

59
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,760
Rym: We don't know about the culture of this con.

60
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,398
Rym: We're ready to go.

61
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:24,639
Rym: We get on the bulk bus.

62
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,340
Scott: I had high expectations for Magfest.

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,011
Rym: Way high.

64
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,880
Rym: Way higher than zinc icon the first time we went.

65
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:32,420
Scott: I knew it relatively.

66
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,139
Scott: It was only a few thousand people which it was.

67
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:38,900
Scott: I knew it was four days and we were going, you know, in the afternoon on the first the Thursday.

68
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,399
Scott: So we're going to get a lot out of it and I knew that it was culturally similar to us.

69
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:45,860
Scott: So I was like, all right, this is going to be, this is going to be good.

70
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:54,460
Rym: Also, a hotel con very rarely for seven, you know, back before we did GeekNights or anything, we would go to a lot of hotel cons where 24/7 gaming, you know, they're kind of small.

71
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,220
Rym: Everything's crazy.

72
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:58,420
Rym: And now we only go to like Pax's and Otakons all the really big ones.

73
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:06,620
Rym: So it would be, it was interesting to go back to a hotel style con being this much older and weirder and, you know, doing panels and everything.

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,032
Scott: Yep.

75
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:14,860
Rym: So we get on the Volt bus and there is immediately BO, like wicked gamer BO.

76
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,200
Scott: There was no way to a hundred percent know who had this BO.

77
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,238
Rym: It was probably that guy sitting right behind us.

78
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,659
Scott: Probably that guy sitting right behind us.

79
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,360
Scott: And I think it was a, it was a case of no hair washing.

80
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:25,840
Scott: That is what it seemed like.

81
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,759
Rym: He was wearing the kind of brown like gamer shirt with a gamer thing on it.

82
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,880
Scott: He was definitely going to Magfest because he's probably been worn a couple of times.

83
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,920
Scott: because he asked us at the end of the bus ride, Hey, you guys going to Magfest?

84
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,100
Scott: Do you want to, you know, ride over there together or whatever?

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,700
Scott: Cause he was taking the Metro, I think the bus was like half Magfest people.

86
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,840
Scott: We took an expensive, not yellow cab to get over there.

87
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,138
Rym: Basically the guy, if the guy, you out there, if you're watching this, you probably know who you are.

88
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:51,138
Rym: We're sorry, but you had some mad BO.

89
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,859
Rym: So when you said, Hey, you want to share a cab?

90
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:53,959
Rym: I said, yeah, we'll see.

91
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:55,879
Rym: We booked out of that.

92
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:04,537
Scott: We didn't know that, that we didn't know for sure that that was the BO guy, but I was pretty sure that was my, if I had to, if I had to bet on which guy on the bus had the BO, that's the guy I would have bet all my money on.

93
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,979
Scott: So Magfest number two is the old lady who's sitting in front of me who didn't move.

94
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:08,959
Rym: She could have had a BO.

95
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,979
Rym: She could have been dead.

96
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,218
Scott: She wasn't dead.

97
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,300
Rym: Though Magfest overall had a BO problem.

98
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,900
Rym: We cannot pretend that that was not there.

99
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,652
Scott: Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

100
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:19,880
Scott: Yeah, BO problem.

101
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,198
Scott: Do I have a BO problem?

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,518
Rym: I mean, we got back to Manhattan, I remember stepping off the bus and it was a breath of fresh air.

103
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,300
Rym: Jesus, Magfest, take a goddamn shower.

104
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,700
Scott: I even saw some Magfest staff who would wear the same shirt on one day.

105
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:34,460
Scott: And then I saw them the next day and they had the same shirt.

106
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,799
Scott: Not setting a good example.

107
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,780
Rym: Now if you wear the same shirt more than two days in a row, that's hobo territory.

108
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,200
Scott: That is indeed hobo territory.

109
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,860
Rym: Now I understand cons, like a lot of con staff only have one staff shirt.

110
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:45,559
Rym: You got to fix that.

111
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,800
Scott: I saw staff wearing non-staff shirts multiple days in a row.

112
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,299
Rym: I did wear my kilt three days, but you can go a long time with pants and non-bifurcated male garments.

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,780
Rym: Can't do that so much with a t-shirt.

114
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,840
Scott: No, not at all.

115
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:00,640
Rym: I don't know what to do about the BO problem.

116
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,980
Rym: I think it's because it was 24/7 con and because the hotel sold out, there were like seven or eight people in every room and I don't think people were taking showers.

117
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:11,520
Scott: I think also the elevator problem, this wasn't a problem for us.

118
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:16,550
Scott: We were in a hotel that was across, it was just like one street away from the actual hotel.

119
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,320
Rym: Too far to walk in the cold.

120
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,483
Scott: It was the official overflow hotel, but they had a shuttle bus, which is basically a big van.

121
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:24,840
Scott: take us over there every half hour back and forth.

122
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,460
Scott: And actually I was expecting to lose a lot of time with that shuttle bus.

123
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,888
Rym: Yeah, we really like that.

124
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:33,540
Rym: going into this, we're like, that's probably going to ruin our con and we have nothing to complain about.

125
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,658
Scott: The shuttle bus totally worked.

126
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,959
Scott: What was not good is that the main hotel was actually two hotels.

127
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,920
Scott: It was a big tall tower style and it was also a separate retreat style.

128
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:47,920
Scott: So there were two hotels in the main hotel that were connected physically to Magfest.

129
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,740
Scott: The big, you know, the wide out retreat one was totally cool.

130
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,620
Scott: That's where our friends were staying and they could just go to the room anytime.

131
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,159
Scott: And if I had to go back and it was in the same location, I would want to be in that retreat hotel.

132
00:06:58,243 --> 00:06:58,415
Rym: Yup.

133
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:58,818
Rym: Definitely.

134
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,739
Scott: To avoid the shuttle bus.

135
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:08,600
Scott: But the tower hotel was a credibly tall tower with not so many rooms on each floor with a lot of floors and poorly programmed elevators.

136
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,539
Scott: And even if those elevators are well programmed, there was no way to deal with that load.

137
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Scott: There were not enough of them.

138
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,320
Scott: They were not designed to handle that much traffic going up and down constantly.

139
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:27,475
Rym: But a saving grace for us, the few times I tried to go up there and I failed many times cold guy had an awesome party on the eighth floor that I tried to go to like four times and I just couldn't make it.

140
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:31,060
Rym: No one there knew about the go down to go up or go up to go down trick.

141
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,420
Rym: Like no one was doing that.

142
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,460
Rym: Our bag of tricks, and this has got a running theme with us at Magfest.

143
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:37,839
Rym: Our bag of tricks was brand new here.

144
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,760
Rym: Like Otakon, all those big cons, everyone's figured that stuff out by now.

145
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,380
Rym: Magfest, no one there really goes to other cons.

146
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,780
Rym: Most of the people we talked to were like, this is not like this is my first Magfest.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,019
Rym: They were like, this is the first convention I have ever been to.

148
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:51,840
Rym: I'd like someday to go to PAX.

149
00:07:52,020 --> 00:08:01,119
Scott: Yeah, I didn't do a survey obviously, but of the people I talked to, right, the vast majority of the people either had never been to another convention or never been to a convention before ever.

150
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,460
Scott: And there were a few people obviously who are big convention goers like us.

151
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,440
Scott: But most of the people I talked to were not convention type people.

152
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:10,299
Scott: You know, I think there was maybe that was that one girl who knew tax.

153
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:10,629
Rym: Yeah.

154
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,599
Scott: And there was a girl with like a paxi scarf.

155
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:13,440
Rym: That was weird.

156
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,194
Rym: Small circles running into people who helped staff conventions.

157
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:19,140
Rym: we used to staff through a third person randomly in Virginia.

158
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,459
Scott: Yeah, it happens.

159
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,906
Rym: But the back to the

160
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:22,187
Rym: B.O.,

161
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:28,000
Rym: like the elevator thing, I think as a result, people just weren't taking showers because, you know, eight people in a room, they want to go play some games.

162
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,780
Rym: They take the elevator down, figure I'll shower later when everyone's done.

163
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,559
Scott: Can't go back up.

164
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,080
Scott: There's no way to get back up to the line at the elevator at all times, no matter when you pass by those elevators.

165
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,919
Scott: There were always people there waiting to get it on and off.

166
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:47,520
Scott: And also on YouTube, I didn't see this during the convention because, you know, it was like a whole areas of this convention that I missed out on because I just didn't get over there.

167
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,339
Scott: Even though it's a small con, there were just areas they didn't go to.

168
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:55,340
Scott: And, you know, part of that experience I saw on YouTube was the elevator party.

169
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:56,352
Scott: Right.

170
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:06,060
Scott: Apparently, if you go on YouTube and search for Magfest Elevator Party, there are people who got a boombox, got in those elevators and were just like, and you could hear the elevator party coming up in the elevator.

171
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,677
Rym: Right.

172
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,020
Rym: The trouble with that, though, that's not helping guys.

173
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,440
Scott: No, but it was a. you know, it was a cultural thing at the con that we missed out.

174
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,639
Rym: Well, remember back at RIT, the elevator party when I was a freshman, just that one day randomly all the elevators had a party at them.

175
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,200
Scott: Yeah, that was good.

176
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,016
Scott: We missed stuff like that.

177
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:24,860
Rym: But we got to do something about the BO because it's not like PAX, like every con.

178
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,879
Rym: There's that one guy with BO like you.

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,658
Rym: He walks through the room and everyone's like, oh, my God, that guy or, you know, small gaming con.

180
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,837
Rym: There's like the cluster, the fat Warhammer guys with their BO.

181
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,080
Scott: When that happens.

182
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:36,440
Scott: Right.

183
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,277
Scott: If there's a Warhammer room with BO or if there's a DDR machine with BO, just don't go near it.

184
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:40,535
Scott: Yeah.

185
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,620
Rym: Or go over there once.

186
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:42,998
Rym: You'll be like, that's my DDI.

187
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:43,877
Scott: You get away.

188
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,099
Scott: You just keep your eye on it.

189
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,279
Scott: Wait for it to clear out at a quiet moment because a 24 hour con, it's going to be cleared out at some point.

190
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,579
Scott: Go over there and do it while it's cleared out and get out.

191
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,700
Rym: And a lot of cons, like on Sunday, I'll have the BO because people just don't shower.

192
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,419
Rym: There's one to travel.

193
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,459
Rym: And you expect that.

194
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:08,560
Scott: But this was like constant and everywhere, like low level, no matter where you went, no matter where you went, there was a tiny bit of BO everywhere, except in a few places like the hotel restaurant and I or outside.

195
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:08,771
Scott: Yeah.

196
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,151
Scott: Right.

197
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:10,920
Scott: Where there was smoking by the engine.

198
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,554
Rym: The first time I walked outside, it was like, whoa, whoa.

199
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,340
Rym: Like suddenly I realized that I had become accustomed to BO.

200
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:17,780
Scott: Of course.

201
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:26,760
Scott: And then there were obviously, you know, every few minutes or so, if you were walking around or, you know, there would be a person with really bad, there'd be a peak, like there was a constant low level and peak.

202
00:10:26,902 --> 00:10:28,139
Rym: So the average was pretty high.

203
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:31,240
Scott: So it's sort of like a bad guy in a video game who leaves like smoke behind him.

204
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,520
Scott: And there were a few of them and they were traveling around and eventually it was smoke everywhere.

205
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:36,517
Scott: And since it's four days, forget it.

206
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:39,400
Rym: And you might think we're being harsh, complaining about BO at a con.

207
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,145
Rym: No, you have.

208
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,180
Rym: no, you don't understand this was bad.

209
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,540
Rym: So wash everything.

210
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,617
Scott: So we talked a lot about BO.

211
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,657
Scott: It's been a lot of time on it.

212
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,596
Rym: So there's only one other thing that went wrong with Magfest big, Oh, big thing that went wrong.

213
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:49,934
Rym: Yeah.

214
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,880
Rym: Magfest nine had the worst registration I have ever seen in a decade of going to conventions.

215
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,980
Scott: I know we have ripped other conventions for the bad red lines.

216
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,498
Rym: Oh my God.

217
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:00,539
Scott: Anime Boston.

218
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:08,920
Rym: I had to wait in line for two hours was that he ripped Otakon for not mailing the badges and those rippings were deserved rippings.

219
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,900
Scott: However, those rippings pale in comparison to the ripping that Magfest needs.

220
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:18,700
Rym: You might think like anime Boston, the year before we went was like famous for its bad red line.

221
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,920
Rym: Like it was just a disaster.

222
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,038
Scott: Even cuts.

223
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,020
Scott: There was a cards of con that we did not attend that.

224
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,980
Scott: Apparently the badges did not show up until like Friday night or Saturday or even not as bad penguin con back in the day.

225
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,079
Rym: The badges didn't show up until late Friday night.

226
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,799
Scott: Pango Condo wasn't a bad red.

227
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,479
Scott: He walked up to the coat check and it took a minute and you got a bad once they had the badges to sell.

228
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:37,894
Rym: Yeah.

229
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,180
Rym: Thing is they didn't check the badges until they could sell them.

230
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,076
Rym: So they, they fixed it.

231
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:41,518
Rym: Yeah.

232
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,080
Rym: Magfest had not only a badge disaster, absolute disaster.

233
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:47,639
Rym: No staff did anything about it.

234
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,520
Scott: They didn't even try to fix this problem whatsoever.

235
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,730
Scott: Basically what they had is they had a little booth.

236
00:11:52,992 --> 00:12:02,558
Scott: that was the same booth they were selling the merch at and it had maybe three or four laptops at it to which they were, what they would do is they would go up, they would look for you in the database cause it was sold out.

237
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,280
Scott: It was all pre-reg.

238
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,420
Scott: Then they would find your badge with your number on it.

239
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Rym: Like four one nine seven.

240
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:09,219
Scott: Here you are.

241
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,959
Scott: Here is your number.

242
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:10,859
Scott: Four one nine seven.

243
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,436
Rym: And they'd make you sign this waiver.

244
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,059
Scott: I was watching their computers and the computers are very slow, very shitty software or whatever they were using.

245
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:25,379
Rym: They were also checking every single convention attendees ID to see how old they were and giving wristbands depending on your age.

246
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:26,098
Scott: Yeah.

247
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:28,799
Rym: All these factors meant about five minutes per person.

248
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:29,775
Rym: Minimum.

249
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,136
Rym: Five minutes per person.

250
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,820
Scott: And then they had a huge pile of like lanyards and stuff.

251
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,039
Scott: You had to rip one out of there.

252
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,133
Rym: So five minutes per person times 4,000 people is.

253
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:40,260
Scott: Even with only a few thousand people, right?

254
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,880
Scott: They only had like two or three laptops there.

255
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,960
Scott: And one of them was just for staff and guests and those sorts of vendors.

256
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,940
Scott: So we waited in a very short staff vendor guest line.

257
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,860
Rym: There were maybe 10 people in front of us in line.

258
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,200
Scott: It took us like over an hour and a half to get through that.

259
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,493
Rym: It was about an hour and 45 minutes.

260
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,000
Scott: But meanwhile, the normal registrant line was gigantic, right?

261
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,019
Scott: Not moving much faster wrapped around the hotel and it took like two hours to move like 100 feet in that line.

262
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,484
Scott: It was apparently there was.

263
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:15,400
Scott: the line was stacked up from when the convention opened on Thursday to when it closed on Thursday.

264
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:19,637
Scott: And I didn't really see that line being non disastrous until Friday.

265
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:23,480
Rym: some point Friday when there was a huge line in the morning, kind of slowly petered out.

266
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,499
Scott: But it's like they didn't try to add more stations, grab more laptops.

267
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,400
Rym: There was no sense of urgency at Otakon when they had a problem.

268
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,860
Rym: I mean, while I don't like the way Otakon does their badges, when there was a reg problem, they're like 10 staffers like, all right, how do we fix this?

269
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,296
Rym: What do we do?

270
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,700
Rym: Let's open up more reg over there.

271
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,540
Rym: Let's do something.

272
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,040
Scott: Yeah.

273
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,920
Scott: Even if there's something that you try doesn't work and you fail, at least you tried.

274
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,800
Scott: Magfest didn't even seem like it was a problem.

275
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,656
Scott: They were just like, yeah, Regen.

276
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:46,498
Scott: We're Regen.

277
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,520
Scott: We got three reg things.

278
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:47,877
Scott: We're going.

279
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:48,338
Scott: Yeah.

280
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:50,440
Scott: It was like they didn't even think there was something wrong with that.

281
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,653
Scott: Hello.

282
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:51,660
Scott: That was disastrous.

283
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,460
Scott: If I had to wait in that line, I might have just left and not if I showed up on Thursday, I would have charged back my credit card.

284
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,959
Scott: I would have charged my credit card, just left.

285
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:58,878
Rym: I wouldn't have left.

286
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,000
Rym: I would have because they didn't check badges anywhere except the video game room in the concert.

287
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,457
Rym: That's true.

288
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,900
Rym: I would have gone to Magfest anyway.

289
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:08,100
Scott: There were some people who were at Magfest, quite a few of them without badges.

290
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:15,200
Scott: Because they didn't go to concerts or they didn't go to the main video game console room, they didn't have a problem.

291
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,559
Scott: They just went without a badge.

292
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:22,100
Rym: I would not have dealt with it had I been an attendee.

293
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,579
Rym: But even as a guest, I had to wait an hour and 40 minutes to get 10 spaces through a.

294
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,020
Scott: Then they didn't even have us in their computer.

295
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:30,500
Rym: We do a lot of conventions.

296
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,419
Rym: Cons often screw stuff up.

297
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:34,880
Scott: I saw it coming a mile away.

298
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:35,944
Rym: One ConnectiCon.

299
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:39,500
Rym: we went to way back, they didn't have our schedule for us or tell us what panels we were doing.

300
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:48,777
Rym: We literally get there, get our badges, get a con book, open it up, find names of panels that we're pretty sure we submitted, and then we just showed up to them expecting to have to do them.

301
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:49,799
Rym: We were right.

302
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,060
Rym: That was the worst I'd ever dealt with until Magfest where we weren't on the list.

303
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,057
Scott: And the staff didn't have- We had to get the panels guy to come up and say, "Yes, these guys are

304
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:57,338
Scott: real.".

305
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,377
Rym: But even then, the panels guy was like, "These guys are for

306
00:14:59,417 --> 00:14:59,619
Rym: real.".

307
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:01,639
Rym: And then he left, and then they still didn't know what to do.

308
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:03,800
Rym: And in the end, they never even gave us our guest badges.

309
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,738
Rym: They gave us normal badges.

310
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,280
Scott: Yeah, they just picked up normal badges.

311
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,220
Scott: Now here's how they could fix this, right?

312
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
Scott: Number one, you need more reg stations.

313
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:10,620
Scott: A lot more.

314
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,018
Rym: No, wait.

315
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,020
Rym: Mail the badges and it won't matter.

316
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,519
Rym: Wait, now what bothers me is that last year, apparently, there's this huge open area right next to the reg area.

317
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,259
Rym: They could have had like 30 people doing reg.

318
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:26,617
Rym: That area was empty, and the area they had for reg was smaller than the room we're recording the show in.

319
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,860
Scott: Yeah, apparently they had it right last year, and they got it wrong this year.

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,379
Scott: But anyway.

321
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,460
Scott: Mail the badges.

322
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,660
Rym: I heard of internal drama among the staff, but that's no excuse.

323
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,019
Scott: Mail the badges.

324
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:41,160
Scott: Even if you don't mail them, or even if you do mail them, there are still some people who got to pick them up at the con.

325
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,040
Scott: Pac still has a reg area, even though they mailed the badges, right?

326
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,500
Scott: Have a lot of stations that are dedicated to only reg.

327
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,880
Scott: Do not assign people numbers of badges beforehand.

328
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,334
Rym: How come you're looking up Joe Blow's 4192 badge?

329
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,080
Rym: Just hand him a random badge and write down the number you gave him.

330
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,640
Scott: Exactly.

331
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:04,300
Scott: It's like, you know, they write down when you pre-reg, you're now number 100, and then they got to find badge 100, which takes a bunch of time.

332
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,596
Scott: No, no, no.

333
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,438
Scott: Don't write any number.

334
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,219
Scott: And then when the guy shows up, give him the next badge.

335
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,160
Scott: Give him the order in which they show up to MAGFest.

336
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,857
Scott: Now there are, they do one thing that is kind of nice, I don't know how I feel about it, right?

337
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:19,080
Scott: Which is, if you decide to pay more money, you can get a better badge, right?

338
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,999
Rym: Those are real nice badges.

339
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,799
Scott: They're really nice.

340
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,000
Scott: You can get these big acrylic badges, and they also had these plastic ones.

341
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,540
Rym: I saw one guy with a wood one.

342
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,200
Rym: I don't know if he made it, or if that was- You pay more money, you get a better badge.

343
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,580
Scott: But the better badge, what was different about it was it doesn't get you anything except the better badge.

344
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,040
Scott: It's like, look, I paid a bunch of money to support MAGFest.

345
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,600
Rym: Now I'm, we're both way against, like, Comic-Con style, where, like, if you pay more, you just hit the line.

346
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:41,260
Scott: It's like, pay more.

347
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,479
Scott: You get to see Stan Lee no matter what, and you get a bunch of merch, and you get a t-shirt, and you get all this stuff.

348
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,680
Scott: It's like, well, it's not really fair.

349
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,500
Scott: Someone paid more money, they get to cut the line.

350
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,197
Rym: I mean, look at PAX.

351
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,880
Rym: It's super underpriced because everyone's got time, not everyone has money.

352
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,440
Rym: That's right.

353
00:16:54,561 --> 00:17:00,600
Rym: But with MAGFest, the super supporters really don't seem to get much of anything except They don't get anything except a better badge.

354
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,159
Rym: They had to stand in that same line.

355
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:14,380
Scott: But that is, the thing is, the reason it's relevant is because that's how they look you up to see if you're a super supporter, regular supporter, and those people actually have their names already written on the badges, pre-engraved, right?

356
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:17,619
Scott: But I think the thing, what they could do- Well, have them check in like guests.

357
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:18,618
Scott: Exactly, right?

358
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:19,959
Scott: Or if you mailed them the badge.

359
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,579
Rym: Also, just how did it take an hour for you to deal with 10 people?

360
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,400
Rym: Because they didn't have any process for dealing with a problem.

361
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,919
Rym: We get up there and we're not on the list.

362
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,500
Rym: We're doing panels, and they had no way to resolve that situation.

363
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,852
Rym: They didn't have like, "Okay, if you have a problem, go over here to this one person who's only going to deal with

364
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:37,299
Rym: problems.".

365
00:17:37,402 --> 00:17:37,600
Rym: Nothing.

366
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,200
Scott: Yep.

367
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:38,916
Scott: All right.

368
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:41,680
Scott: So that's most of what was bad at MAGFest.

369
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:51,060
Scott: I have no other major complaints- Bad reg, bad BO, general level of unprofessionalism that needs to be professionalized at the top as the convention grows.

370
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:55,260
Scott: Oh, one other thing that was bad was a panel scheduling.

371
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,920
Scott: They didn't leave any gaps between panels.

372
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,635
Rym: But Tim knows.

373
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,318
Rym: They know.

374
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,999
Rym: He was like, "Yeah, we wanted to do that.

375
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,716
Rym: Next year, we're doing

376
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:00,798
Rym: it.".

377
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,100
Scott: They know they're going to fix it, but it was a problem this year.

378
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,840
Scott: They had a panel that ended at three and a panel that started at three.

379
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:15,099
Rym: They also didn't do explicit room clears, because a couple of panels- I did see sometimes rooms got cleared- No, they cleared them, but they didn't have any policy about it.

380
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,560
Rym: That's true.

381
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,780
Rym: We're all pissed off now, because they thought they were going to see the next panel.

382
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:23,379
Rym: And then they had the shuffle of trying to force everyone out, force everyone in, and that was a little problematic.

383
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,419
Rym: I guess if we're going to complain, the projector was a teeny bit dark.

384
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,280
Scott: And the hotel- The tabletop library was meager.

385
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:32,160
Rym: Non-existent.

386
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,073
Rym: But we brought a library.

387
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:36,420
Scott: We brought a better library than they had.

388
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:37,579
Rym: I don't know.

389
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,860
Rym: There weren't enough tables for tabletop gaming, but what are you going to do in that venue?

390
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,020
Rym: The hotel, this is kind of a weird aside.

391
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:46,620
Rym: I don't know how that hotel got away with it.

392
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,580
Rym: The fire marshal, like fire code numbers in those rooms were bullshit.

393
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,440
Rym: They were astronomical.

394
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,699
Scott: It's like I would go into a room, and if you asked me, "All right, I'm holding my hand over the numbers, right?

395
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,339
Scott: Scott, tell me how many people the fire marshal would allow in this

396
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:00,440
Scott: room.".

397
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,114
Rym: I'd be like what, 40 people?

398
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,820
Scott: With no chairs and no tables.

399
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,580
Rym: No chairs, no tables.

400
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,421
Scott: I'd be like 40.

401
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:05,170
Scott: I'd be like 40 or 50 max.

402
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:08,720
Scott: I was like, "That is bullshit.

403
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:10,376
Scott: If there were 95 people in here, we'd be

404
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:10,679
Scott: dead.".

405
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,720
Rym: Either that hotel bribed someone a long time ago, or Alexandria has way different laws from cities.

406
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,860
Scott: Yeah, Alexandria, Virginia.

407
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:29,277
Scott: I don't know what your fire marshal's up to, but he might be mad corrupt, or that hotel is corrupt or something, because that was not- I mean, the numbers were not only where the number is dangerous, but you could not fit that many people in the rooms.

408
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:29,774
Rym: Yeah.

409
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,660
Rym: Like physically.

410
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:31,500
Rym: I don't know where.

411
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:32,880
Rym: Maybe they changed the walls.

412
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:34,099
Scott: I think they have a sardine law.

413
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,018
Scott: It's like if you can close it with a little piece of metal and twist a lid on it, then it's safe.

414
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:41,700
Rym: Now, it's not a complaint against MagFest.

415
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,180
Rym: There's nothing they could do about that other than moving venues, which they should.

416
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,959
Rym: That venue's terrible.

417
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,120
Scott: It was not good.

418
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,900
Rym: I mean, the concert space is itty bitty.

419
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,940
Rym: We didn't even go to the concerts, because there's no way.

420
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,020
Scott: I can't comment on the quality of the concerts.

421
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,280
Scott: I'm sure everyone who went to them was super excited about the bands they saw and whatever.

422
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,100
Scott: So I'm sure that the music was excellent.

423
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,160
Scott: But it was a tiny room.

424
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,280
Scott: When I looked into that room while it was being set up, it was a very small room.

425
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,060
Rym: It was smaller than some rooms with panels in them.

426
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,779
Scott: And they wouldn't let you bring a bag in there.

427
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:11,280
Scott: So I was like, I'm not leaving my bag anywhere, so I can't go in there.

428
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:16,880
Rym: But the reason I bring up the Fire Code stuff is that MagFest is used to this, because they're in Alexandria.

429
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,580
Rym: For whatever reason, it has this weird fire marshal la-la land.

430
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,140
Rym: Katsu-Kan and all the other Kansans we've been to in DC, they don't have that luxury of just ignoring fire safety.

431
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:28,640
Scott: I heard the story.

432
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,120
Scott: The fire marshal was there on Thursday or Friday, and Thursday, and walked around.

433
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,518
Rym: It was weird that we never saw him, though.

434
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,600
Rym: I mean, Kinetic can't even.

435
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:38,840
Rym: I see the fire marshal every day poking his head in every single room and counting numbers.

436
00:20:39,843 --> 00:20:40,380
Rym: New York City?

437
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:40,879
Rym: Same way.

438
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,418
Rym: Katsu-Kan?

439
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:41,735
Rym: Virginia?

440
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:42,837
Rym: I don't know.

441
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,680
Rym: Alexandria?

442
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:44,896
Scott: I don't know.

443
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,559
Rym: I hope MagFest never burns down.

444
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,520
Scott: That'd be very bad.

445
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,320
Rym: So all that aside, MagFest was super crazy awesome.

446
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,299
Scott: Well, it was super crazy awesome.

447
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,240
Scott: It was pretty good.

448
00:20:56,343 --> 00:21:00,380
Rym: It was the most fun I've had at a non-PEX convention in a long time.

449
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:00,697
Rym: Right.

450
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,580
Scott: But were those funds that you had, how much of those funds were MagFest-like?

451
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,879
Scott: MagFest's fault or your own fault?

452
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:14,299
Scott: Well, the trouble- Because if you can't attribute it to MagFest, if it's something that you could have done, say, just if you got a hotel room on your own.

453
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:24,999
Rym: The trouble with that, though, is that some of the things I could do on my own, but what MagFest provided was not the con or anything the con did, but the fact that a bunch of like-minded people all showed up in the same place.

454
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,738
Rym: Had there been no con and all the same people showed up, then yeah, I could have done almost all these things.

455
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,240
Rym: But MagFest and PAX are kind of polar opposites of the kind of cons we like.

456
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:43,360
Rym: PAX is definitely the, if you go to this con, there is stuff to do that the con is giving you things like these epic stadium concerts and this giant tabletop library.

457
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,260
Rym: MagFest is not that kind of con.

458
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,540
Rym: MagFest is a room party, hang out with your friends, meet new people con.

459
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,560
Scott: If you're not going to a concert or playing in the arcade, right, or going to a panel- You really don't need a badge.

460
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:03,200
Scott: Pretty much everything else, well, not only do you not need a badge, but you're not going to be able to, the con has nothing else to offer you except to make your own fun.

461
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,740
Scott: There are nerds here at the same time as you make your own fun.

462
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:12,020
Scott: Have a room party, get your own gaming going on in tabletop, do something on your own with these people to have fun.

463
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,320
Scott: I mean, people stopped to watch the football game, right?

464
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,860
Scott: Because we were very close to Baltimore.

465
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:18,060
Scott: So all the Ravens fans lined up for the game which they lost.

466
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,360
Rym: How many people would have walked out of PAX to go to bars and watch a football game?

467
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:31,200
Rym: If it was a Seahawks playoffs game, they would have- Even then, if it was an important game, how many people would leave PAX for that versus people who were just chilling in MagFest?

468
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:38,200
Scott: Well, the difference was if PAX was a hotel con and if the game was on in the hotel lobby in PAX and you could have watched it with all these PAX people.

469
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,580
Rym: While you're playing games and drinking.

470
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:40,060
Rym: Right.

471
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,760
Rym: Because we spent most of our con in either tabletop or in the lobby of the hotel.

472
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,920
Scott: Playing jungle speed mostly, but also many other tabletop games.

473
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,600
Scott: And because it was a four-day con, we actually had a lot of time to play tabletop RPGs.

474
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:55,839
Rym: We played a surprising number of like- we played a whole free market, but so the con is laid out.

475
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,257
Rym: You know, we don't really do this about other cons we go to because everyone knows how they're all laid out.

476
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,080
Rym: If you've been listening to GeekNights or going to these cons, not a lot of you have been to MagFest.

477
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,820
Rym: It's kind of small.

478
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,960
Rym: People aren't flying from Seattle.

479
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:07,260
Rym: So I think it's worth it to talk about the layout.

480
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:08,360
Rym: There's not much there.

481
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,400
Rym: There's- they had an artist alley vending area that- That was sort of mixed with the arcade.

482
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:23,580
Scott: Everything was sort of, you know, the area where all the, you know, the vendors and the tabletop games and all that stuff was all sort of squished into one space, sort of, you know, with some doors in between, right?

483
00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:23,896
Rym: Yup.

484
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,175
Rym: So they had a panel area like this long hallway and at the end were three tiny little panel rooms.

485
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,120
Scott: Tiny itty bitty!

486
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:37,740
Scott: But also the, uh, the jam space, the MagFest famous jam space was down there, which was sort of annoying because you could hear it in the adjacent panel rooms.

487
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,660
Rym: It was a little annoying, but it was also kind of this like background groove.

488
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:48,419
Scott: Well yeah, well it's like, it was like, okay, they put it over there because they wanted to keep it out of the way of everything else, which is what you should do because the jam space makes a lot of noise.

489
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:56,840
Rym: Now what they should have done, remember in the hotel right next to MagFest was this gigantic, like open bar area that they probably could have rented out or used that they didn't.

490
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,540
Scott: Yeah, that was in the retreat area.

491
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,380
Scott: They should have put it in the retreat area, but I guess they just didn't think of it.

492
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:09,320
Rym: In fact, had they had the, all the bands doing their jam space there and then paid the hotel to open that bar, that would have been a rocking room.

493
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,800
Scott: They could have made some awesome down in that room.

494
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,000
Rym: Apparently there were multiple parties that started in that room.

495
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,180
Rym: Like suddenly there'd be a party in that room and the hotel kept shutting them down.

496
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:23,219
Scott: I think part of the problem though, is that room is so close to hotel rooms that it would disturb hotel guests.

497
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:32,799
Rym: However, this hotel for the venue that it was, if MagFest were going to stay in this venue, they would have to get a contract with the hotel that basically literally rents out the entire hotel.

498
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,479
Rym: There were non-MagFest people, yet MagFest sold out and anyone who was not MagFest in that hotel was fucked.

499
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:40,893
Scott: Okay.

500
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,860
Rym: Like badly.

501
00:24:42,403 --> 00:24:45,239
Rym: I can't imagine them having enjoyed themselves and whatever they were trying to do.

502
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,160
Scott: But anyway, yeah.

503
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,219
Scott: So the vending area, you know, it had a mix.

504
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,279
Scott: It was just a bunch of tables all cramped up.

505
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,680
Scott: A surprising number though, were selling retro game stuff.

506
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:54,097
Scott: Yeah.

507
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:55,340
Rym: They were doing the hard sell.

508
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,539
Rym: One guy was like, check this out.

509
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,540
Rym: Gold, Zelda, gold, Zelda, 10 bucks, 10 bucks.

510
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,118
Rym: Come on, man.

511
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:00,340
Rym: And I was like, you know, you want it.

512
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:06,640
Scott: I was like, you know, it was, it was kind of weird because on the one hand it was fun to walk around and look at all this stuff, but I wasn't buying any of it.

513
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,207
Rym: But if you were a collector

514
00:25:08,247 --> 00:25:20,718
Scott: of that sort of thing or an aspiring collector, then this was like the place for you because there was never, I don't think there's any place else in the U S that's going to have that sort of collection of, you know, retro game stuff all in the same place for sale.

515
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,119
Rym: And they were selling, like there was a dude who had a Lynx in an unopened, still string craft box.

516
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,839
Scott: There was all sorts of crazy stuff like that.

517
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,959
Scott: You know, if you could think of it, it was, if it wasn't ultra rare, you know, ultra, ultra rare, it was there.

518
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,620
Rym: What was cool though is that it was also kind of an artist alley and there were people selling the kind of stuff you see at like an anime con artist alley.

519
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:40,720
Rym: And they were really good.

520
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,040
Rym: I think the best guy was the one who had the like oil pixel paintings.

521
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,159
Scott: Yeah, that guy was the best.

522
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:49,420
Scott: We met him on the final day Sunday when we were just about to leave.

523
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,599
Scott: He was a cool guy.

524
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,260
Rym: What's weird is he was not the only one.

525
00:25:52,360 --> 00:26:00,020
Rym: There were a couple of these people that we talked to and obviously not a representative sample, but enough to where I wonder this anecdotal, they never really went to other cons.

526
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:07,199
Rym: And we were like, man, if you went to an anime con and we explained like, yeah, Otakon is an order of magnitude bigger than this.

527
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:14,219
Rym: The artist alley is bigger than all of magfest, multiple orders of magnitude and your stuff is better than most of what we've seen there.

528
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:15,800
Rym: You could make money.

529
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:17,180
Scott: You could make money.

530
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,139
Rym: And he's like, tell me more about these anime cars.

531
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,920
Scott: I don't know how much money you would make at the, at the magfest, but whatever.

532
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,393
Rym: Yeah.

533
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,800
Rym: But there were stuff there.

534
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,540
Rym: I didn't buy anything, but I walked around.

535
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,500
Rym: There was a trouble that the alleys, like the alley itself, it was like this narrow.

536
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,540
Scott: You basically couldn't walk through it, but you could, you could walk through it very slowly, but it was never extremely crowded.

537
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,520
Scott: You know, it was never like, it wasn't like a Otakon dealer's room where people are packed in cause they really want some shit, right?

538
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,806
Scott: It was very, you know, there, it was cramped in space wise, but not so many people in that area.

539
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,920
Rym: It was a chill hangout.

540
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,160
Rym: Like some of the guests were hanging out there.

541
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,199
Scott: James Rolfe, who we never actually talked to was, yeah, one person we really wanted to see at the con.

542
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,777
Scott: We never saw.

543
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,200
Rym: Oh, well, well, cause we were going to go to his panel and I think we ordered Chinese food instead.

544
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:58,676
Scott: Yeah.

545
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,400
Scott: That happened a lot ordering food, but actually food delivery worked really well.

546
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Rym: Unlike, unlike Connecticut, we got some slightly average, you know, okay.

547
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:07,260
Rym: Chinese food one night.

548
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:07,879
Rym: We got some okay.

549
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:08,619
Rym: Pizza one night.

550
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,258
Scott: Yeah, it was good.

551
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:09,798
Scott: It was okay.

552
00:27:10,653 --> 00:27:10,800
Scott: Yeah.

553
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:18,560
Scott: So right next to the dealer vending area was, you know, the, pretty much the core of magfest, which is the arcade and also the console gaming room.

554
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:20,447
Rym: So it's very rare that we will say this.

555
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:24,140
Rym: packs could learn a lot from how magfest got their arcade set up.

556
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:24,880
Scott: That's for sure.

557
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,539
Rym: Pax has money and yet had the tiniest little arcade.

558
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:33,390
Scott: Well, I mean the arcade, but the packs, uh, free play console room was a little different, right?

559
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,300
Scott: Because the way the packs free play console is, is they have all these consoles and you to rent, you pick the game you want, right?

560
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:45,279
Scott: Whereas the magfest console was more the style of, you know, Otakon where it's like, these are the games that are set up.

561
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,859
Scott: Just go play.

562
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,939
Rym: I think there should be a mix.

563
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:58,600
Rym: I think it's a, it's, I like the idea of having, I check out Kaboom and I go play it with my friends, but also the common games, like a bunch of people are going to want to play game cube smash brothers, have a whole area dedicated to that in the corner.

564
00:27:58,828 --> 00:27:59,019
Scott: Yup.

565
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,639
Scott: And just have a whole bunch of chairs lined up with the right controllers and people just loser walks.

566
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,136
Scott: Keep going.

567
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:11,760
Rym: It was more than, I don't think the logistics of the game room were better than Pax's game rooms or Otakon's game rooms or anything, the culture was better.

568
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,940
Scott: I mean there were, there were certain items that were missing.

569
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,698
Scott: Like there was no rampart machine, which is, you know, personal, how much can we complain about that?

570
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,060
Rym: Katsu con is the only con that's ever gotten us around part machine.

571
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,498
Rym: But in terms of my request, nonetheless, we were like, you guys get a rampart machine and they got it.

572
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:34,460
Scott: But in terms of, you know, total quality of, you know, the, the whole collection of games there were to play in the arcade and the console, it was like a plus, right?

573
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:40,837
Scott: They had more arcade machines than Katsu con has ever had way more than Pax ever had much better selection.

574
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:41,724
Scott: Yeah.

575
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,842
Scott: God plus.

576
00:28:42,902 --> 00:28:47,440
Rym: they had a crane that you could play a crane game full of stuff.

577
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,600
Rym: Now they bricked up the end.

578
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,219
Rym: They're like, all right, you can't actually get the toys, but you can play this crane game for free.

579
00:28:52,301 --> 00:28:53,279
Rym: And it was way fun.

580
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:57,237
Scott: They had some pinballs, but they kept breaking, but they still had pinballs and they kept fixing them.

581
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:06,420
Rym: They kept fixing them as much as they had that ice cold beer, this electro mechanical game that we'll, we'll talk about that in a separate show sometime, but it was a, you got to get this little ball bearing pass.

582
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,260
Rym: It's like labyrinth, but you're moving this bar instead of moving the labyrinth.

583
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:10,629
Scott: Yeah.

584
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,739
Scott: It was, it was pretty tricky.

585
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,580
Scott: Pete, I think was rocking that he got to four or five holes.

586
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Rym: I got to three on the internet.

587
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,919
Scott: You can see someone beat the whole thing.

588
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,560
Rym: Daddy, three holes.

589
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,358
Rym: That's the best I could do.

590
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:18,760
Rym: Yeah.

591
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,160
Rym: But they had a lot of Japanese arcade cabinets, which was awesome.

592
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,060
Rym: Which are really nice.

593
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:35,879
Scott: And it makes, you know, the thing I really, I never really realized about, you know, I knew it, but I didn't know it was that, you know, you sit at them because they're meant for, instead of standing, you sit and it was just so comfortable because they were exactly the right height.

594
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,540
Scott: I guess they're supposed to be the right height for Japanese people who are small, but they were not that much bigger.

595
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,779
Scott: It was the right height for me.

596
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,620
Scott: And sitting at them was just so comfortable.

597
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,120
Scott: Like that we played the Tetris one and the sticks and buttons on them were so nice.

598
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,200
Rym: Japanese arcade cabinets.

599
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,677
Rym: Cause I haven't had a lot of experience with them are way just higher quality than anything I've ever seen in America.

600
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,900
Scott: It really makes me wonder though, because the sticks and buttons on them were so nice.

601
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,320
Scott: And but supposedly the street fighter sticks we have are the same buttons and sticks, but it's not quite the same.

602
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,739
Scott: But I think those are worn in, so I got to, I got to wear in my stick to make it nice like this.

603
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,459
Rym: Just sit there and play.

604
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:06,888
Rym: I don't know.

605
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,600
Rym: Rip your tapper for an hour.

606
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,299
Scott: I got to play something.

607
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,079
Scott: Black man.

608
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,920
Rym: It was like, we were playing some SNK, Capcom, all those kinds of games, games that I normally would never bother with at a convention.

609
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:20,576
Rym: And yet playing it on the Japanese arcade cabinet, I actually really liked those games now.

610
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:20,997
Rym: Yeah.

611
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:26,345
Rym: I gave those games a short shrift and I'm now I'm doing plays some a shmup that had like some re.

612
00:30:26,465 --> 00:30:28,239
Scott: you had ridiculous thing, right?

613
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,180
Scott: It was bullet hell, but you could also deliver bullet hell.

614
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,360
Rym: It was like Raiden, except you have 10 times as many bullets and they're 10 times bigger.

615
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:39,020
Scott: And then you also have to pay for any of these games.

616
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,680
Scott: Just push the button.

617
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,611
Rym: It was also, it was weird.

618
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,780
Rym: It was like cute pig girls.

619
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,199
Rym: Like everything was a pig girl.

620
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:45,699
Scott: I'm sure someone knows what the game is.

621
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,800
Rym: It was kind of the kind of just a little bit, but it wasn't, it wasn't super perverted.

622
00:30:51,947 --> 00:30:54,280
Rym: But that arcade, I, I had a lot of fun.

623
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,480
Rym: I could spend my whole con in that RDR machines.

624
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,880
Scott: They had everything.

625
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,660
Scott: They had old school machines.

626
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:03,040
Scott: They had, uh, you know, they had those games, the all kinds of everything.

627
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,920
Rym: The only thing they didn't have were the like sixties, seventies, electro mechanical stuff.

628
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,940
Rym: Like the, uh, I mean, ice cold beers, ice cold beers, a relatively recent game.

629
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,560
Scott: It's not like pinballs, pinball games or old pinballs, but it didn't have like sub hunter.

630
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,170
Scott: No.

631
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,760
Scott: One thing they did have was this challenge area, right?

632
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,620
Scott: Basically they have a bunch of laptops set up with emulators and it's got, how many challenges did you beat?

633
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,018
Rym: One.

634
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,680
Rym: How many did I beat?

635
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,175
Rym: Yeah.

636
00:31:26,523 --> 00:31:28,420
Scott: Uh, you could have beaten two if you would've done the one I did.

637
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,420
Scott: So the way the challenge thing works, I think you can download the challenges.

638
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,340
Scott: I think I'm not sure.

639
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,219
Rym: If not, let's ask mag festival to give them to us.

640
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,716
Scott: But anyway, you get the challenges and it's a little menu and you can choose normal, hard, unfair.

641
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,480
Rym: There's different, very well put together.

642
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,320
Rym: And you're like, all right, I want to play any S unfair challenges.

643
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:50,439
Rym: It's like, all right, beat this bionic commando level under this time without dying with no health, whatever.

644
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:52,899
Rym: Or like crazy, what was it?

645
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,818
Rym: Beat one of the airships at the end of Mario three with a hammer suit without losing the hammer suit.

646
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,860
Scott: They were all really, really hard.

647
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:03,080
Scott: And many of them I could have beaten given enough time.

648
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,719
Rym: I could have done it.

649
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,479
Rym: I just didn't want to.

650
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,120
Scott: No, I mean like I could go and do it now, but it would take me half a day to practice and get it just right.

651
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,200
Rym: The point of this, I don't think is, can I practice all day and do it?

652
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:17,759
Rym: The point is, all right, who's got the biggest Nintendo balls, sit down right now, beat that level of bionic commando.

653
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,162
Rym: I don't know that.

654
00:32:18,223 --> 00:32:24,516
Scott: if they put it online though, you might be able to practice before the con and then you just have to perform at the con to score, but then it's more of a performance art.

655
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:24,980
Scott: Yeah.

656
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:32,300
Scott: But anyway, the thing is you, you load out, you choose a selection, you push the load save state button and you play, it starts you right at the challenge.

657
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:33,300
Rym: Like it's perfect.

658
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,660
Scott: And there's people watching the whole time.

659
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:37,579
Scott: So if you beat a challenge, you say, did I beat it?

660
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,159
Scott: And they say, yup.

661
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:39,719
Scott: And they mark your badge number down.

662
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:40,719
Scott: Hello packs.

663
00:32:40,801 --> 00:32:41,976
Scott: This is our badge number idea.

664
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:45,420
Scott: It's just, this is like the most meager use of the badge number.

665
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:46,200
Scott: Right.

666
00:32:46,321 --> 00:32:53,200
Rym: But also packs, as we've learned, magfest printed the same kind of badges you print and they had individual serial numbers on each one.

667
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:53,580
Rym: Yeah.

668
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,980
Rym: It can't be that expensive.

669
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,849
Scott: Our code won't cost any more than that.

670
00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:58,999
Scott: because you know, it's like, Hey, we got to do it.

671
00:32:59,184 --> 00:32:59,358
Rym: Yeah.

672
00:32:59,465 --> 00:32:59,740
Scott: Anyway.

673
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,259
Scott: So they wrote down your badge number and if you won enough challenges, then you would get prizes.

674
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:06,540
Scott: And you know, there's a whole chart showing what you could get.

675
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,080
Scott: Like you beat three NES challenges.

676
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,856
Scott: You get the NES badge.

677
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,880
Rym: Cause you're going to beat three of those challenges.

678
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,939
Scott: Anyway, the challenge that I beat, I beat the capture Carmen Sandiego, they start you in the final.

679
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,018
Rym: It took you two tries.

680
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:16,707
Scott: No, it didn't.

681
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:18,660
Rym: I see you missed a lot of questions.

682
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,160
Rym: I recall.

683
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,240
Scott: No, I only missed one.

684
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:20,758
Scott: Only one.

685
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,839
Scott: I only missed one thing.

686
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,080
Scott: And then I corrected it immediately.

687
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:23,650
Scott: I don't know.

688
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:25,419
Scott: They gave me that.

689
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,198
Scott: They marked my thing.

690
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,380
Scott: I'll go ask them for the record.

691
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,959
Scott: I beat the capture Carmen Sandiego.

692
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,839
Rym: It took me a lot of tries to beat bionic commando because I'm good at, bionic commando is my game.

693
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:35,120
Rym: I figured, all right, I'll do the bionic commando challenge.

694
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,060
Rym: Scott did do the mega man challenge.

695
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,339
Scott: The mega man two challenges.

696
00:33:38,742 --> 00:33:41,440
Scott: It was like, okay, beat the big tank with bubble only.

697
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:45,859
Scott: And I, you know, I got it like halfway and I was like, man, if I sat here for two more hours, I could have this.

698
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,320
Rym: I'm not going to waste two hours of my convention.

699
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:54,640
Rym: It was what beat heat mans level without dying with no power ups, including heat man, no alternate weapons.

700
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,980
Scott: See, not only you had to do, basically what it comes down to is you have to do all the jumps in the middle without using the two rocket.

701
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,180
Rym: I think I could have done that.

702
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:07,120
Scott: I could have done that with enough tries, but then on the same try, cause you can't die right on that same try.

703
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:10,800
Scott: You also have to beat heat man, which means you have to make the jumps.

704
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,516
Scott: Don't lose any of your health or lose barely any health and beat heat man without a weapon.

705
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,083
Scott: without with a P.

706
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:22,476
Rym: I can't beat hardly any robot masters with, with the P.

707
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:26,313
Scott: I can beat like two or three robot masters with the P, but still I can be quick man with.

708
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:32,540
Scott: I can be, I can be a quick man, airman, flash, man, or a quick man, airman, flash, and metal man.

709
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,135
Scott: I could be any of those four with just the metal man, metal man first.

710
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,456
Scott: You don't have to show it's actually airman is considered the first whatever

711
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:39,980
Rym: metal metal

712
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:48,458
Scott: man is advanced first anyway, but yeah, I can be any of those with just the P probably without dying in a reasonable amount of time, but heat man, that would have taken quite a few tries.

713
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:57,599
Rym: So the one I beat was I sat there and I tried to beat the dark level in bionic commando, not just with no weapons or anything without dying, but without any leveling up.

714
00:34:59,011 --> 00:34:59,340
Rym: I cheated.

715
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,959
Rym: I sat there and leveled up in the level.

716
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:01,574
Rym: Yeah.

717
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:08,580
Scott: There was actually one that I almost kind of did, which is the Kirby one, which was Kirby's adventure beat the mini boss with the ball.

718
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:08,714
Rym: Yeah.

719
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,280
Rym: That was sad.

720
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,159
Rym: You finally beat the boss.

721
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,379
Rym: They're like, all right, and I'll beat the level.

722
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:11,840
Scott: Yeah.

723
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,240
Scott: It's like, you have to beat the hall.

724
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:16,119
Scott: It's the mini boss level where you fight all the mini bosses.

725
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:22,259
Scott: And I was like, I beat one of the mini bosses with the ball, but you have to beat all the mini bosses with the ball and you have to have the ball at the end.

726
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,740
Rym: But what the gist of this is that it was an awesome thing and other cons should take this model.

727
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,300
Rym: I mean, packs and a lot of cons have the, Oh, here's the tournament at a concert.

728
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,680
Rym: We ran like Rampart tournaments just out of nowhere.

729
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:37,900
Rym: They just had this kind of constantly going super hardcore, super old school skill based tournament.

730
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,180
Scott: 24 seven based skill based.

731
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,358
Scott: It is the important part of that.

732
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:43,248
Rym: That was kind of the culture of this on.

733
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,740
Rym: Magfest is really a more skill based con.

734
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,798
Rym: Like the omega is very much random until the end to a large degree, even at the end.

735
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:55,400
Rym: and and the gaming culture, people kind of they play games, but they're not really playing to win Magfest.

736
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,200
Rym: Everyone's sitting down and playing to win the goddamn game.

737
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:58,819
Rym: That's right.

738
00:35:59,260 --> 00:35:59,800
Scott: Is that all?

739
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,900
Scott: It was mostly concentrating on skill games and hard games, right?

740
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,960
Scott: Fighting games or a lot of fighting games.

741
00:36:05,442 --> 00:36:09,675
Scott: You know, they had the console FPS, which are games of low skill, but they're games of skill.

742
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,020
Rym: It was a separate discussion for another time.

743
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,500
Scott: They had old school, you know, Donkey Kong and all this anyway.

744
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,920
Scott: So video games at Magfest is like, you know, very important and very good, very, very good.

745
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,060
Rym: So except for the BO, the only things we like, our con was basically tabletop.

746
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,979
Rym: We spent almost the entire con short of running all the panels we did, sitting in tabletop, playing games with our friends and with strangers.

747
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,659
Rym: A lot of jungle speed.

748
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,000
Scott: We played jungle speed the most.

749
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,500
Scott: I think the reason we played it the most is because, you know, we got people hooked on it, right?

750
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,040
Scott: Mostly our friends were hooked on it because they'd never played it before.

751
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:43,140
Scott: And we had the, I had the brand new expansion, which really amped up the difficulty and also an asshole.

752
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:43,620
Scott: Right.

753
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,199
Scott: And then on top of that, it's a game that you could just play.

754
00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:48,060
Scott: You just whip it out and play it very quickly.

755
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,200
Scott: Unlike say, you know, Agricola, which I brought, we didn't play it because Agricola has a bunch of set up time and rules teaching.

756
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,060
Scott: Whereas jungle speed, we just like, all right, we just play it.

757
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,680
Scott: It's easy to start.

758
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,196
Rym: It's easy to go.

759
00:36:57,363 --> 00:36:57,533
Rym: Yup.

760
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,260
Scott: I'm sad we only played modern art once towards the end of the convention.

761
00:37:01,341 --> 00:37:03,460
Scott: I feel like if we would have played it early, we would have played it again.

762
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,579
Rym: But we ran that big Bonanza game that was really rockin'.

763
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,980
Scott: That was a really good Bonanza game to play.

764
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,429
Rym: Bonanza is such a good whip out at a con game.

765
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:16,280
Rym: because there's this weird, we praise the culture of Magfest so much, but again, as I keep saying, our mega tricks was brand new at this con.

766
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,980
Rym: People didn't have the German style board games rocking.

767
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,659
Rym: They didn't have any stuff like ready to go.

768
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,524
Rym: They weren't, there wasn't a culture of like, people are playing a game, Hey, I'll join you.

769
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:28,400
Rym: So we'd ask people like, we like, we need one more, Hey, you want to play jungle speed?

770
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:29,519
Rym: People were afraid.

771
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:30,400
Scott: It was weird.

772
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,740
Scott: We were playing banana grams at one point and there was a girl sitting there.

773
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,419
Scott: I was like, you want to play?

774
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,319
Scott: She's like, no, no, no.

775
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,179
Scott: I'm like, why not?

776
00:37:35,904 --> 00:37:37,640
Rym: It's she was like, no, no, I can't play.

777
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,279
Scott: I was like, was the banana gonna bite you?

778
00:37:39,802 --> 00:37:41,240
Rym: It's not my bite you, but not the banana.

779
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,420
Scott: What are you afraid of?

780
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,720
Scott: He's going to play banana grams.

781
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,640
Rym: And even if you just sit there and go, uh, or like, you know, we ran a bunch of action castles because you know, people never heard of it there.

782
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,940
Rym: They never heard of anything here, but we'll get to that.

783
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:57,418
Rym: So after our panel, we did the kind of thing we do at PAX, like, Hey, we got the room for another hour.

784
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,039
Rym: Who wants to play a game?

785
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,917
Rym: And at PAX a thousand people will be like, yeah, let's go here.

786
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,720
Rym: Everybody got the fuck out of that room except for five awesome people.

787
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,399
Rym: They were there.

788
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,480
Rym: Like people were like game.

789
00:38:07,626 --> 00:38:07,958
Rym: I don't know.

790
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,640
Rym: And they like, they made their way out of the room as quick as they could.

791
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,340
Rym: They didn't want anything to do with this game.

792
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:12,707
Scott: Yeah.

793
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:16,420
Rym: And then the five people who remain loved it and were like, was it awesome?

794
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,540
Rym: They're like, yeah, should you, was everyone who left this room stupid?

795
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,840
Rym: They're like, yeah, I don't know why they left.

796
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,439
Rym: They're stupid.

797
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:21,747
Rym: Yeah.

798
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:29,180
Scott: But yeah, apparently the people, even though they were culturally with us, they weren't, you know, let's play a game because we were a foreign culture.

799
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,640
Rym: We were, we were a little different.

800
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:33,160
Rym: So we're like, Hey, we're going to run a role-playing game.

801
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,674
Rym: You want to play?

802
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,220
Rym: And everyone else who was doing that at the con had already arranged ahead of time.

803
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,479
Rym: Like we're going to play this gamma world game at this time in this hotel room.

804
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:41,951
Rym: Yeah.

805
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,640
Rym: Cold guy had some rockin tabletop going, but it was up in his private room party.

806
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:46,218
Rym: Really?

807
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,640
Rym: Well, public room party there.

808
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,997
Rym: Apparently that was a lot of people were saying that was like the big fun tabletop in role-playing room party.

809
00:38:53,402 --> 00:38:55,500
Rym: We just couldn't get up there cause the elevators whatever.

810
00:38:55,741 --> 00:39:02,959
Rym: And I don't know, total random aside cause cold guy, he gave us at the con an Atari 2,600 that was modded to have S-video out.

811
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,300
Rym: We've been, it's sitting right there.

812
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,900
Rym: We've been playing this thing pretty much nonstop since we got back.

813
00:39:08,283 --> 00:39:08,519
Scott: Totally.

814
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,196
Scott: It's great to have an Atari that actually works on a real modern television.

815
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,200
Scott: It's like, Whoa, you don't have to use any adapters and cables or anything weird.

816
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:18,899
Scott: You just pop in a game, you turn it on.

817
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,740
Scott: It works every time.

818
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,072
Rym: No blowing guys like that big.

819
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:22,615
Scott: Yeah.

820
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,700
Scott: Outlaw is the best.

821
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,478
Rym: Oh my God.

822
00:39:24,941 --> 00:39:31,399
Rym: But I came to your room the last time on Saturday night, it was like two 30 in the morning and I knocked on the room party door.

823
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,879
Rym: I'm pretty sure you were asleep and I woke you guys up.

824
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,697
Rym: So I'm sorry.

825
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,700
Scott: But anyway, uh, we did some panels at magfest.

826
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,700
Scott: We did, we were on two panels that were intellectual panels.

827
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,880
Scott: It was actually, you know, we call everything.

828
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,858
Scott: We do a panel, but most of what we do is actually a lecture presentation.

829
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,800
Scott: We did two panels that were actually panels.

830
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:51,592
Scott: And I was, I was apprehensive going in cause.

831
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:56,919
Scott: I was like, all right, these people based on their emails seem smart, but we don't know them, but we don't know them.

832
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,980
Scott: And we don't know their personalities and we don't know their public speaking skills.

833
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,119
Scott: So is this really going to work out?

834
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,820
Rym: It worked out crazy.

835
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:07,640
Rym: Well, when we sit down, we're all introducing ourselves for the panel.

836
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:11,019
Rym: And I realized that we're the only ones without doctorates and like advanced game theory.

837
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,224
Scott: Yeah.

838
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,839
Scott: And then dr hazard hung out with us like the whole con.

839
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:14,508
Rym: Oh yeah.

840
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,230
Rym: Dr.

841
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:15,500
Rym: Hazard.

842
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,440
Rym: Everyone was awesome.

843
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,760
Rym: But dr hazard was kind of the most awesome.

844
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:19,980
Rym: I think we meshed pretty well.

845
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:20,518
Rym: That was fun.

846
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:21,000
Scott: Yeah.

847
00:40:22,043 --> 00:40:27,840
Rym: All of us for a bunch of magfest staff, cause we were talking game theory over dinner and I think we got far too into the math.

848
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,180
Rym: So we turned to the magfest guys.

849
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,040
Rym: We're like, you want to play the dollar auction?

850
00:40:32,523 --> 00:40:33,460
Rym: Two dollar auction.

851
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,120
Rym: In fact, it was two dollar auction anyway.

852
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,720
Scott: Um, so yeah, uh, the panels actually went really well in the second one.

853
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,078
Scott: I was good.

854
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,980
Scott: Amprehensive again, even though the first one went well because this guy was moderating.

855
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,539
Scott: Yeah, but he's our friend from a kinetic con, but I was still, I was like, all right, he's acting a little goofy right now.

856
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:49,792
Scott: Right.

857
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,060
Scott: But then as soon as the panel started, he was for serious.

858
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,520
Rym: He was like, well, will the gentleman on the left answer gave us all titles?

859
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,400
Rym: I was the captain.

860
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:57,119
Scott: No, I was the admiral.

861
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,999
Scott: I don't know what I was.

862
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,440
Scott: I was hefe or something, but yeah, we just, you know, the panels, they both went great.

863
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:05,240
Scott: Even though the attendance was and no, the attendance was good.

864
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:05,899
Rym: It was okay.

865
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:09,019
Rym: I mean, for this kind of con, this is not a panel going con.

866
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:14,480
Rym: The people who are going to panels are the hardcore people who care about the thing or the people who want to go see the celebrity.

867
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,326
Rym: Like John St.

868
00:41:15,346 --> 00:41:17,080
Rym: John does his panel, the rooms full of course.

869
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:18,060
Scott: Yes.

870
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,220
Scott: Actually he was doing a whole bunch of stuff at the con bridge.

871
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:20,920
Scott: Anything you can do.

872
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,260
Rym: Oh my God.

873
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,251
Rym: Well, we had to do like a separate segment on John St.

874
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:25,759
Rym: John at this time, but we did, you know, losing should be fun.

875
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,889
Rym: And we did this to other panels.

876
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:28,019
Rym: losing should be fun.

877
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:34,499
Rym: We actually had to kind of modify it like as we were going, because we went to a panel before we did anything else.

878
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:39,397
Rym: And it was this guy who was talking about like collaborative storytelling in role-playing games.

879
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,140
Scott: Yeah.

880
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,380
Rym: And we're like, all right, let's see what this guy's deal is.

881
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,118
Rym: Let's see if he knows.

882
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:44,440
Rym: And he's very articulate.

883
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:45,180
Rym: He knows his stuff.

884
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,900
Scott: He wasn't like the greatest presenter, but he was pretty good above average for a convention panel, especially a convention of that.

885
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:56,619
Rym: However, the panel, the gist of the panel was this is a world where only Dungeons and dragons exists.

886
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:03,559
Rym: So be that as that being the reality of the world, how do we make D and D a better role-playing game?

887
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:05,608
Rym: He basically did this great panel.

888
00:42:05,628 --> 00:42:09,240
Rym: that is only great if you've never heard of any other role-playing game ever.

889
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:09,476
Rym: Yeah.

890
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Scott: It was, it was similar to the way in which those we talked about in the forum, right?

891
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,500
Scott: These biologists who discovered calculus on their own.

892
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,660
Scott: It's like, they didn't know calculus.

893
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,490
Rym: At one point in the panel, the guy was like, so what if, what if?

894
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:26,520
Rym: now bear with me, suppose you at a little point, if a player rolled really well, you let them control the narrative.

895
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:27,720
Rym: Tell me what you found.

896
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,680
Rym: Like, let them have a little control of the story.

897
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,571
Scott: I was like, have you played any games invented?

898
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:41,760
Rym: since you might think this is going to break your game and it might, but if you just start introducing these little to give them a little bit of control, we're like, we, we all raise our hands simultaneously.

899
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:49,360
Rym: Like, have you ever heard of burning wheel inspectors, lacuna, we listed like a hundred games and he was like, no, I've never really heard any of those.

900
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:49,820
Scott: Yeah.

901
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,180
Scott: I think this is the thing.

902
00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:52,800
Rym: When he opened the panel, I felt bad.

903
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,500
Rym: He was like, so I, you know, I'm a really experienced role player.

904
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:01,760
Rym: I've been playing tabletop, you know, role-playing games like Dungeons and dragons since 1996.

905
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:01,847
Rym: Yeah.

906
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:04,074
Scott: And I was like, really only 96, huh?

907
00:43:06,282 --> 00:43:13,418
Scott: But yeah, it's like, imagine if there was some guy who came in to talk about board games and everyone in the world, the only board game anyone played in the whole world was monopoly.

908
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:24,420
Scott: Nobody like 99% of people only play monopoly and very, very few people I've ever even heard of any other board game, but monopoly board game is synonymous with the word monopoly.

909
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,140
Rym: The culture of magfest is really rocking in many ways.

910
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,700
Rym: Like it really jived with us, but it was also very insular.

911
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:31,480
Rym: Like it's, it's the separate little thing.

912
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:47,579
Rym: Like a lot of the people there either only go to magfest and never any other cons or have, like, this is the first time they've ever been to, or there are people who go to all the DC area cons, like they go to katsu con and magfest and all these things in one of our panels, like monopoly came up.

913
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,320
Rym: And when we were like, you guys realize you're all playing monopoly wrong, right?

914
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,120
Rym: Free parking.

915
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,659
Rym: Isn't in the rules the way you think it is.

916
00:43:53,862 --> 00:43:55,580
Rym: And you're supposed to be auctioning it off properties.

917
00:43:56,241 --> 00:44:00,160
Rym: The whole room was like, what one guy, aren't you just like, no, it's in the rules.

918
00:44:00,942 --> 00:44:09,239
Scott: One guy was like from the UK and he was like, you know, I'm not going to do the XA, but he's like, you know, everyone, he's like, everybody in the UK, he's like, that's not the rules.

919
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,600
Scott: Everyone in the UK plays with the money on free parking.

920
00:44:11,742 --> 00:44:13,139
Scott: I'm like, yeah, everyone does.

921
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,528
Scott: Everyone's not following.

922
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,100
Rym: the one guy in the audience had his iPhone.

923
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,900
Rym: He's like, it's like the right.

924
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,516
Rym: It's not there.

925
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:19,440
Scott: Yeah, of course.

926
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:19,979
Scott: It's not there.

927
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,897
Rym: What do you think this is?

928
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:21,822
Rym: So we did.

929
00:44:21,843 --> 00:44:27,205
Rym: losing should be fun, but we actually kind of, we went really short on some of the things we normally talk about.

930
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:32,119
Rym: losing should be fun as an excuse to talk about all the indie RPGs that no one at this con had ever heard of.

931
00:44:32,563 --> 00:44:34,320
Rym: We were like, oh my God, inverting wheel.

932
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,760
Rym: If you lose, it's actually kind of awesome.

933
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,900
Rym: We talked about dread.

934
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:37,978
Rym: People lost it.

935
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,500
Scott: People always lose it when they hear about dread, even at the start of the con.

936
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,099
Rym: Yeah, but they're starting to, people know about it now.

937
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:48,640
Rym: This caused a little bit of a problem for us later because after doing all this, we were rocking the tabletop.

938
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,340
Scott: Scott ran a free market game, like a whole free market game early Sunday morning.

939
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:57,300
Rym: And we got people to sit down and commit to a four hour game of free market at a con.

940
00:44:57,724 --> 00:44:57,898
Scott: Yep.

941
00:44:58,783 --> 00:44:59,800
Rym: I think our mercy was great.

942
00:44:59,901 --> 00:45:04,458
Rym: Our whole sh*t was we want to shrink everybody else, like make shrinking cool because we want to be giants.

943
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,740
Scott: You could have just made yourselves bigger instead.

944
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,399
Rym: No, but we want to make everyone else smaller.

945
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:09,816
Scott: You could do that too.

946
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,900
Rym: Because it means more absolute space for us because I was playing colossus.

947
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:18,015
Rym: But we ran a bunch of swords, like the sword burning wheel because no one ever heard of this.

948
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,500
Rym: And once again, the people who have never played a role playing game before were the ones who rocked it the most.

949
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,460
Rym: There's this one girl, I forget your name.

950
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,399
Scott: She was definitely the best.

951
00:45:25,702 --> 00:45:26,138
Rym: She was cute.

952
00:45:26,382 --> 00:45:26,979
Rym: She sits down.

953
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,639
Rym: She's like, I've never played a role playing game before.

954
00:45:28,864 --> 00:45:29,680
Rym: Can I play this with you?

955
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,320
Rym: And we're like, yeah.

956
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,320
Scott: Let's go for it.

957
00:45:31,401 --> 00:45:32,140
Scott: We want you to play this.

958
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:32,617
Rym: Play it now.

959
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,518
Rym: I hand her the elf.

960
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,620
Rym: She's reading over the sheet.

961
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,060
Rym: I'm just starting to explain to everyone else what their characters are.

962
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,900
Rym: She's like, that dwarf's not getting the sword.

963
00:45:40,746 --> 00:45:41,759
Rym: Can I argue with him about it?

964
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,939
Rym: Or should I just stab him?

965
00:45:43,504 --> 00:45:44,060
Rym: Give me some dice.

966
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:44,478
Rym: What do I do?

967
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:44,940
Rym: What do I do?

968
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,254
Rym: Let's go.

969
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:46,920
Scott: She was very awesome.

970
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:51,420
Rym: She died weeping bitterly and alone after failing to tend the dwarf's mortal wounds.

971
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,079
Scott: Meanwhile, there are some D&D guys.

972
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:56,220
Scott: They had played D&D at least once before, right?

973
00:45:56,562 --> 00:46:00,617
Scott: And then we're just like, all right, we'll go to the elven land and then we'll go to the dwarven land.

974
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,557
Rym: What is with you people always being like, we're going to compromise.

975
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,360
Rym: We're going to be nice and chill.

976
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,200
Scott: And I'm trying to egg him on.

977
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,138
Scott: It's like, come on.

978
00:46:07,441 --> 00:46:09,080
Scott: Are you really going to let him get away with that?

979
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,659
Scott: It's like, that's the sword you needed.

980
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,860
Rym: One guy rage quit.

981
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,640
Rym: Well, he didn't rage quit.

982
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,160
Rym: He basically had really the sword.

983
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:14,720
Scott: He must quit.

984
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,758
Rym: He was like, you know what?

985
00:46:16,321 --> 00:46:17,959
Rym: The whole time he's like, yeah, the elves can have the sword.

986
00:46:18,182 --> 00:46:18,620
Rym: I don't care.

987
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,600
Scott: It's a new category of quitting.

988
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,680
Scott: I think it's like, I don't know, fade quit.

989
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,960
Rym: And then he just got quieter and quieter.

990
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,260
Rym: And then at one point he was like, yeah, I'm really not going to play this anymore.

991
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,220
Rym: And he's got up and walked away.

992
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:30,768
Scott: Yeah.

993
00:46:31,462 --> 00:46:31,839
Scott: It didn't work.

994
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,880
Rym: So we were like the dwarf, we're like the dwarf just kind of has an epileptic fit and chokes to death.

995
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,180
Scott: I was like, he just, the dwarf wanders off into the darkness choking to death in the corner.

996
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:42,534
Rym: I don't know.

997
00:46:43,881 --> 00:46:44,300
Rym: It was weird.

998
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:44,979
Rym: That was just weird.

999
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,240
Rym: He seemed to be having fun though.

1000
00:46:46,611 --> 00:46:46,700
Scott: Yeah.

1001
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,780
Rym: I don't know what was up with that guy.

1002
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:48,500
Rym: I think he was in over his head.

1003
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:54,019
Rym: I think he thought we were going to play this really short light game and we sit down and we're playing a short game, but it's burning a wheel.

1004
00:46:54,268 --> 00:46:54,520
Rym: Yeah.

1005
00:46:54,860 --> 00:47:00,260
Scott: I mean, the only thing that in my life that it reminds me of is I was at a public speaking class in high school.

1006
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,340
Scott: It was just called speech, but it was public speaking class.

1007
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,740
Scott: And I had one friend and he had, you know, the stage fright, but he went up there.

1008
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,680
Scott: He started giving a speech.

1009
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,498
Scott: He was doing just fine.

1010
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,199
Scott: He was doing great.

1011
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:09,700
Scott: Actually.

1012
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:10,299
Scott: I was like, yeah.

1013
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:10,799
Scott: All right.

1014
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:11,680
Scott: All right.

1015
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:11,980
Scott: He's going.

1016
00:47:12,342 --> 00:47:13,419
Scott: And then just suddenly he stops.

1017
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,500
Scott: He's like, I can't do it anymore.

1018
00:47:14,682 --> 00:47:15,159
Scott: I'm like, what?

1019
00:47:15,821 --> 00:47:18,600
Scott: It was like, it was that kind of, you know, someone's up there.

1020
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,479
Scott: They're doing their thing.

1021
00:47:19,581 --> 00:47:22,219
Scott: And then just suddenly just like, they like, I give up.

1022
00:47:22,421 --> 00:47:24,020
Scott: It's like, it didn't even look nervous.

1023
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,980
Scott: Normally you can tell someone's nervous.

1024
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,019
Scott: They're stuttering or they're, they're going slow or they're shifty.

1025
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:29,500
Scott: Right.

1026
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,000
Scott: It's totally just fine.

1027
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:31,899
Scott: And then I quit.

1028
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:32,977
Scott: I was like, what?

1029
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:40,520
Rym: But I mean, the swords we rerun, I don't want to get, we can't have time obviously to talk about every sword we ran, but they were all pretty damn epic.

1030
00:47:40,682 --> 00:47:42,320
Rym: And Pete was running danger patrol.

1031
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,160
Rym: People are really digging the danger patrol.

1032
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:51,180
Rym: Everyone digs danger patrol, but as a result of the panel and talking about it at the end of the night, even when I was like, my throat's gone, my voice is dead.

1033
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:52,459
Rym: Like I got to go to bed guys.

1034
00:47:52,861 --> 00:47:58,040
Rym: And all these kids come up, they're like, please, we heard about this game that you guys were running.

1035
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:58,938
Rym: Can we play?

1036
00:47:59,601 --> 00:48:01,119
Rym: And I can't turn a guy down like that.

1037
00:48:01,304 --> 00:48:01,393
Rym: Nope.

1038
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,860
Rym: He's like, we played D and D and nothing else.

1039
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:04,000
Rym: I heard this is different.

1040
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:04,488
Rym: Yep.

1041
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,220
Scott: You're right.

1042
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,820
Rym: Those kids, they, that was the blackest dwarf I've ever seen.

1043
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,420
Rym: He walked in like Shat killed everybody.

1044
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,177
Scott: All right.

1045
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:13,519
Scott: Anyway.

1046
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:15,278
Scott: Uh, what else went down in Magfest?

1047
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,760
Rym: I mean, our con was pretty much doing our panels, playing tabletop and playing video games.

1048
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,599
Rym: We didn't do a lot else.

1049
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,040
Scott: I do want to point out though, uh, that at Magfest, right.

1050
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,019
Scott: We kept score.

1051
00:48:25,722 --> 00:48:26,179
Rym: Uh, we did.

1052
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:28,320
Rym: We had the league of hero legends, right?

1053
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,220
Scott: Anytime somebody won a game at Magfest, any competitive game, right.

1054
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,200
Scott: Or any challenge we set up like, all right, high score on this right now.

1055
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:35,635
Scott: Let's go.

1056
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:36,360
Scott: Right.

1057
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,039
Scott: They got a point.

1058
00:48:37,602 --> 00:48:39,239
Scott: And, uh, the final score is Tim.

1059
00:48:39,606 --> 00:48:40,218
Scott: I got one point.

1060
00:48:41,024 --> 00:48:42,340
Scott: Uh, that's Tim McNeil, the head of panels.

1061
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:42,600
Scott: Yep.

1062
00:48:42,861 --> 00:48:43,898
Scott: Uh, George got a point.

1063
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:44,316
Rym: Yeah.

1064
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,960
Scott: Uh, Pete got five points.

1065
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,520
Rym: Well, cause Pete was rocking the ice cold beer, right?

1066
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:50,120
Rym: He was also rocking the ice cold beer.

1067
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,437
Scott: Wyatt got one point.

1068
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,572
Scott: Uh, Rym got 13 points.

1069
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:54,798
Scott: Not bad.

1070
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,633
Scott: But Scott got 15 points.

1071
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,360
Scott: However.

1072
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,260
Scott: What do you mean however?

1073
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:00,400
Scott: I beat you by two points.

1074
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,440
Rym: You did beat me by two points.

1075
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:01,900
Rym: That's legit.

1076
00:49:02,361 --> 00:49:03,840
Rym: What are you going to come up with?

1077
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,419
Rym: The only thing I'm going to point out, I'm just going to, this is true information about one of the challenges.

1078
00:49:09,061 --> 00:49:14,518
Rym: Scott and I had a game of DDR and Scott failed in the second song and I was winning by an order of 93 points.

1079
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:15,220
Rym: I didn't fail on any song.

1080
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,240
Rym: You failed in the second song.

1081
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,419
Scott: It didn't F. It didn't F kick me out.

1082
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,639
Scott: I got, I got at least a D every time.

1083
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:26,820
Rym: D because you failed, but you came back because your score is incrementing two points per step after you would hit the point of failure.

1084
00:49:27,123 --> 00:49:28,219
Rym: That's why your score was so low.

1085
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:28,958
Scott: I didn't fail.

1086
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,800
Scott: It didn't say failed.

1087
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:35,939
Rym: However, in the third song, which I was wearing boots and I mistakenly thought I can do rhythm and police on maniac and boots.

1088
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,260
Rym: Scott bumped it down to trick.

1089
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,140
Rym: So he got a bunch of points.

1090
00:49:38,841 --> 00:49:44,478
Rym: I failed immediately on the song because I tripped on my boot and then I got a 300 combo on the rest of the song.

1091
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:45,480
Rym: All right.

1092
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:47,400
Rym: Technically though, the score, there was points.

1093
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:47,938
Rym: Scott won.

1094
00:49:48,183 --> 00:49:48,440
Scott: All right.

1095
00:49:49,061 --> 00:49:51,959
Scott: So even if I give you the DDR, I'm still winning by two.

1096
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:55,660
Rym: And if you give me the DDR, that means you lose a point and I get a point.

1097
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:07,246
Scott: But on top of that, do you recall there was a game that I knowingly knew that you were an expert at this game, yet I agreed to challenge you to it and lost because I was ahead so much.

1098
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,057
Rym: What game was that?

1099
00:50:08,343 --> 00:50:08,720
Scott: I forget.

1100
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:09,880
Rym: But what game?

1101
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:10,533
Scott: Huh?

1102
00:50:12,067 --> 00:50:12,460
Scott: What game?

1103
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:18,678
Rym: In fact, I also point out that I played the Capcom versus SNK with you and I am the worst fighting game player in the world.

1104
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,069
Scott: But there was a game that you were expert at that.

1105
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,293
Rym: I also played Street Fighter two against you.

1106
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,739
Rym: I did okay there.

1107
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,060
Scott: Yeah.

1108
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,751
Scott: There was a game that you were expert at that.

1109
00:50:26,932 --> 00:50:28,540
Scott: I just said, all right, I'm going to give Rym one.

1110
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,720
Scott: Let's play this expert game that he's awesome at.

1111
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,357
Scott: Because I know that.

1112
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:32,120
Rym: Yeah.

1113
00:50:32,161 --> 00:50:32,797
Rym: What game was it?

1114
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:33,558
Rym: What game was it?

1115
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,278
Rym: Because I don't remember.

1116
00:50:35,385 --> 00:50:37,380
Scott: There was definitely one where I'm like, I know I'm going to lose.

1117
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,179
Scott: Let's just go for it.

1118
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:38,797
Rym: It was got plus.

1119
00:50:39,268 --> 00:50:39,798
Scott: No, it wasn't.

1120
00:50:42,243 --> 00:50:43,499
Scott: Anyway, I've been practicing my god plus.

1121
00:50:44,222 --> 00:50:46,620
Rym: A lot of those were jungle speeds, to be fair.

1122
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,835
Scott: There were many of those 13 over jungle speed.

1123
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:58,459
Rym: So jungle speed, as much as I like the the real wooden totem is probably a good thing with the dog toy totem, because at least five or six times we knock the totem like off into a crowd.

1124
00:50:59,180 --> 00:50:59,460
Rym: Mm hmm.

1125
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:00,559
Scott: All right.

1126
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:00,893
Scott: What else?

1127
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,400
Rym: There was a bunch of random weird stuff like Scott, Pete, why not Pete, Scott, why didn't?

1128
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:05,985
Rym: I were?

1129
00:51:06,005 --> 00:51:07,578
Rym: the only people at this con were in kilts.

1130
00:51:07,885 --> 00:51:08,077
Rym: Yeah.

1131
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:14,800
Rym: But there was this one guy and he I think he stashed like Otakani, he's one of those guys who was like, I'm going to staff every con for the rest of my life.

1132
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:19,100
Rym: Big beard, totally chill guy, old school wargamer, old school anime fan.

1133
00:51:19,622 --> 00:51:22,580
Rym: And he sees us and he's like, I feel stupid.

1134
00:51:23,042 --> 00:51:25,420
Rym: I have 12 kills, six of them are utility kills.

1135
00:51:25,921 --> 00:51:29,100
Rym: I didn't bring them because it was cold and I didn't get a lot of fucking kills.

1136
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:29,569
Scott: Yeah.

1137
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,979
Rym: He's he's a killed guy.

1138
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:31,679
Rym: He's a lifestyle.

1139
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:33,180
Scott: Why did he with that many kills?

1140
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,458
Scott: Why does he have any pants?

1141
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,280
Scott: Yeti had pants and he had enough pants for a whole weekend.

1142
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:38,842
Rym: But it was.

1143
00:51:39,064 --> 00:51:41,360
Rym: I just want to note that guy because that guy was actually pretty awesome.

1144
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,900
Rym: I talked to him for a while about kills.

1145
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:48,339
Rym: He told me there's a formal kill, like a real kill, real looking that's made out of like this polyester blend.

1146
00:51:48,621 --> 00:51:51,938
Rym: It's like 50 bucks, but it's a really has 12 kills.

1147
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:52,611
Scott: Yeah.

1148
00:51:53,021 --> 00:51:57,338
Rym: He's like, if you want to wear a real kill instead of a utility kill, like the ease of the utility kill.

1149
00:51:57,562 --> 00:51:58,360
Rym: I forget what it was called.

1150
00:51:58,481 --> 00:51:59,260
Rym: I got his phone number.

1151
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,378
Rym: I'll talk to him at some point.

1152
00:52:00,924 --> 00:52:01,558
Rym: He was a chill guy.

1153
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:02,435
Rym: John St.

1154
00:52:02,476 --> 00:52:02,780
Rym: John.

1155
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,040
Rym: It's funny to see him because at PAX, we hung out with him for like all of Friday.

1156
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,740
Rym: But we hung out like we went to a restaurant.

1157
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,700
Rym: We walked around the con, but we didn't see him in his natural element.

1158
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,119
Rym: His natural element is go to a hotel con.

1159
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,180
Rym: Everybody is buying him drinks.

1160
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:20,160
Scott: He went to 31 room parties, 31.

1161
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,100
Rym: I thought I was hardcore when I went to bed at four thirty in the morning.

1162
00:52:23,502 --> 00:52:28,260
Rym: When I wake up, I see a tweet from him at like seven a.m He's like 16 room parties later.

1163
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,080
Rym: I think it's time to go to bed on Friday.

1164
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:30,880
Scott: Yeah.

1165
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:37,139
Scott: But he was like on every panel, like any Magfest, any Magfest thing that he was the announcer doing his thing.

1166
00:52:37,384 --> 00:52:37,919
Rym: He was there.

1167
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,279
Scott: He was there Sunday morning.

1168
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,620
Rym: I saw him looking so good.

1169
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,519
Rym: He had his sunglasses on.

1170
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,419
Rym: He's sitting there like, yeah.

1171
00:52:44,701 --> 00:52:48,780
Rym: And then he'd like he'd muster it and say something and then he would go back to hang over there, though.

1172
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,300
Scott: He was there the whole time.

1173
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,239
Rym: He was there.

1174
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:51,876
Scott: He was there.

1175
00:52:52,301 --> 00:52:54,340
Rym: He he had a good shtick going.

1176
00:52:54,380 --> 00:53:02,880
Rym: He would basically like gather an entourage of cool people who would follow him around and just crash room parties, like wander into someone's room party and be like, hey, guys, and do his shtick.

1177
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:03,959
Rym: And people loved it.

1178
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:06,115
Rym: He was the celebrity of the con hands down.

1179
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,959
Scott: You know, he tried real hard and it totally worked.

1180
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,319
Scott: That's that's his place, his place of power.

1181
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:11,668
Rym: Yep.

1182
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:12,998
Rym: The hotel con.

1183
00:53:13,361 --> 00:53:18,340
Rym: And I can't imagine how much alcohol was bought for him by attendees at that con.

1184
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:25,018
Scott: The only other things that I'm remembering now right are we did the Child's Play charity auction.

1185
00:53:25,362 --> 00:53:25,920
Rym: That was actually.

1186
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,356
Rym: So the Child's Play charity auction started out real slow, like no one was bidding right away.

1187
00:53:29,721 --> 00:53:31,120
Rym: So Scott and I were like, oh, we got to do something.

1188
00:53:31,361 --> 00:53:32,279
Rym: So we started bidding it up.

1189
00:53:32,741 --> 00:53:33,819
Rym: We did not need to bid it up.

1190
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,800
Rym: It bid bid up on its own pretty quickly after that.

1191
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,173
Scott: But it's like people just started bringing stuff into the room to sell, like as it was going on.

1192
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,519
Rym: So you might know this guy.

1193
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,973
Rym: He dresses up as the Internet and all the.

1194
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,120
Scott: I don't know his real name.

1195
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:46,979
Scott: I don't know his story.

1196
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,996
Scott: All I know is he's the guy who dresses up at the as the Internet and all the Northeast con.

1197
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,366
Rym: We know him and he knows.

1198
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:54,979
Rym: I see him at every con and he sees us and there's always.

1199
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:56,280
Rym: every time I see him, I give the nod.

1200
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,920
Rym: He gives the nod back at Connecticut, like he raised on some panels, like it runs panels.

1201
00:54:00,284 --> 00:54:01,120
Rym: He's just everywhere.

1202
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,299
Rym: He has the rape clock.

1203
00:54:02,588 --> 00:54:02,800
Rym: Yeah.

1204
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,140
Rym: It's rape a clock on the Internet.

1205
00:54:04,423 --> 00:54:05,180
Rym: That's just his thing.

1206
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,139
Rym: Like Jewish Wolf would.

1207
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:06,410
Rym: Yeah.

1208
00:54:06,782 --> 00:54:07,718
Rym: He walked into the room.

1209
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,220
Rym: He'll have the rape clock and he put it for auction.

1210
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:10,752
Scott: Yeah.

1211
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:15,000
Scott: I was like, Dan, the whole room was like, I didn't see what it went for.

1212
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:16,180
Scott: You know, I don't.

1213
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:16,560
Scott: I wasn't.

1214
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,277
Scott: I didn't stay that long.

1215
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:17,940
Scott: I had to leave.

1216
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,260
Scott: Catch the bus back to New York.

1217
00:54:19,562 --> 00:54:21,620
Scott: But he put the rape clock up for auction.

1218
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,180
Scott: I would not be surprised if he bought it back himself.

1219
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:25,560
Rym: Just as an excuse.

1220
00:54:26,002 --> 00:54:26,619
Scott: As a way to donate.

1221
00:54:27,161 --> 00:54:27,740
Scott: I mean, think about that.

1222
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:33,398
Scott: You can put your own thing up there, you know, and then buy it back no matter how much you have to bid up.

1223
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:33,760
Rym: Yeah.

1224
00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:36,638
Rym: They had that scary Sonic the Hedgehog, like big.

1225
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:37,358
Scott: The girl.

1226
00:54:37,645 --> 00:54:37,840
Scott: Yeah.

1227
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:38,700
Scott: I don't know what her name is.

1228
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,340
Rym: Doll that apparently people have had sex with.

1229
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,880
Rym: I can't quite tell what's going on with it.

1230
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:43,900
Rym: You heard that story.

1231
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,600
Rym: They were trying to tell if it ended up in different people's houses and it was.

1232
00:54:47,124 --> 00:54:47,539
Rym: I don't know.

1233
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,720
Rym: I don't know about that.

1234
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,119
Rym: But when you when you bid on that thing, you don't get it.

1235
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:54,199
Rym: You get to dictate what happens to it, which might be.

1236
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,715
Rym: It got given to me.

1237
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:57,693
Scott: OK.

1238
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,680
Rym: There is a weird story there.

1239
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,960
Rym: I feel like that's a magfest lore.

1240
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,639
Rym: We got to talk more about the Colossus Roar.

1241
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,153
Rym: All right.

1242
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:04,239
Scott: What do you say about it?

1243
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:04,919
Rym: The Colossus Roar.

1244
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,460
Scott: People roar all the time and then everyone loses their voice because it's really dry.

1245
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:08,717
Rym: So at Otakon.

1246
00:55:09,722 --> 00:55:10,019
Rym: Mutskacha.

1247
00:55:11,444 --> 00:55:11,697
Rym: Mutskacha.

1248
00:55:12,681 --> 00:55:13,060
Rym: Mutskacha.

1249
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,100
Rym: Mutskacha.

1250
00:55:15,802 --> 00:55:16,097
Scott: Mutskacha.

1251
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:16,735
Scott: Mutskacha.

1252
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:20,259
Rym: Mutskacha.

1253
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,137
Rym: Mutskacha.

1254
00:55:23,003 --> 00:55:23,277
Rym: Mutskacha.

1255
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:23,940
Rym: Mutskacha.

1256
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:24,600
Rym: There's everywhere.

1257
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:31,740
Rym: The Colossus Roar has a lot more culture behind it, like it has more meaning, like when someone does it, they do it for a reason.

1258
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,520
Rym: They're like, I just won this game.

1259
00:55:34,244 --> 00:55:36,600
Scott: All the Baltimore fans were using it anytime they had a good play.

1260
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,975
Rym: We're all eating dinner, us and like a bunch of magfest staff and Dr.

1261
00:55:40,015 --> 00:55:45,360
Rym: Hazard were hanging out in the private room of the restaurant and outside we hear like suddenly.

1262
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:46,895
Rym: Roar, roar, roar, roar.

1263
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:48,700
Rym: And we look on Twitter and like, yeah, touchdown.

1264
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:49,600
Scott: Yeah.

1265
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,840
Scott: And also some people are really good at the Colossus Roar.

1266
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,840
Rym: I can't do it for crap.

1267
00:55:53,300 --> 00:56:00,380
Scott: Sometimes I would heard people do it and I couldn't tell if it was a real person or if the game was just, you know, the volume on that game was cranked up all the way.

1268
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,980
Rym: Or if Colossus himself had come to the con because he lives in New York, he could take the bolt bus down.

1269
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:04,457
Rym: He could have.

1270
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,126
Scott: Right?

1271
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:07,620
Rym: I did not see any Colossus cosplayers though.

1272
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,420
Scott: That was very strange.

1273
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,320
Scott: You think there would be some.

1274
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,939
Rym: Because there was a lot of cosplay.

1275
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:11,999
Scott: Next year it's on you.

1276
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:12,797
Scott: Colossus cosplay.

1277
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:19,440
Rym: But the Colossus Roar is such like a fun, it didn't get annoying and I was really surprised.

1278
00:56:19,582 --> 00:56:21,200
Rym: I thought it was going to be really annoying.

1279
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,060
Scott: But it doesn't, you know, the audio of it, it's audible properties, right?

1280
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:34,939
Scott: It's not like butt scratch, which has a little annoyance and it's, you know, and no one can actually do it that loud to where it's painful or anything like that.

1281
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:39,298
Scott: And since it's hard, it's relatively hard to do and people are losing their voice and getting dry.

1282
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:40,520
Scott: They're not overusing it.

1283
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,880
Scott: They use it like just the right amount.

1284
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,860
Rym: Now the rule is if you hear it, you respond in kind if you feel that the moment is right.

1285
00:56:46,581 --> 00:56:52,300
Rym: And the moment, and it would kind of follow like when the con was the highest energy, the Roars would be pretty frequent.

1286
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,704
Rym: 6 a.m.

1287
00:56:54,026 --> 00:57:00,198
Rym: the Roars are starting to die out because someone does it and everyone else is like, They're also a lot more on Thursday and Friday and less on Saturday and Sunday.

1288
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:08,140
Rym: Though I think the reason it was awesome was that we were sitting there on like Saturday night, it's like three in the morning, catching the last shuttle bus back to our hotel.

1289
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:09,566
Rym: I know 3 a.m.

1290
00:57:09,586 --> 00:57:18,280
Rym: at this con is the same energy level as 3 p.m The con doesn't die out until about 6 a.m It does have amping up periods, you know, obviously in the prime time hours.

1291
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,444
Rym: But like 6 a.m.

1292
00:57:19,485 --> 00:57:20,108
Rym: to 10 a.m.

1293
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:22,380
Rym: is the only quiet-ish time.

1294
00:57:22,802 --> 00:57:24,760
Rym: And even then, there are people playing games in the lobby.

1295
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:36,317
Rym: But we're standing outside and in the hotel, there's like Roar Roar and you hear it through the doors and then off in the woods between us and the other hotel, you hear one guy just like, Whaaaat?

1296
00:57:36,965 --> 00:57:37,720
Rym: Off in the distance.

1297
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:38,213
Rym: Yeah.

1298
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,100
Rym: That was the moment.

1299
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,200
Scott: That's pretty awesome right there.

1300
00:57:40,422 --> 00:57:42,060
Rym: That was like my moment at that con.

1301
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:42,560
Scott: That was good.

1302
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:43,980
Scott: All right.

1303
00:57:44,224 --> 00:57:45,098
Rym: I had a lot of fun at Magfest.

1304
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,480
Scott: I did have quite a bit of fun there, but I don't know.

1305
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,320
Scott: Is it worth two vacation days?

1306
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,118
Scott: Maybe I go back, but I just go back Friday or later Thursday after work instead of taking Thursday off.

1307
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:01,577
Rym: All Magfest brings to the table, to be perfectly honest, is the venue and the culture and the arcade room.

1308
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:09,540
Rym: Everything else, I guess, and the concerts, but the concerts were impossible for us to go to because you couldn't bring a bag in, there's a wall of BO and the room was tiny.

1309
00:58:10,381 --> 00:58:14,460
Rym: But they simulcast the concerts on the hotel TV to anywhere that you wanted to watch it.

1310
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,880
Rym: So every hotel room, that room party just had the concerts going on the TV.

1311
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,379
Scott: That was very good and very clever.

1312
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,417
Scott: But yeah, other than that, it's like Magfest itself doesn't bring anything else to the table, right?

1313
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:29,200
Scott: So it's like, I already have two packets on my schedule, do I really need to go?

1314
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:34,778
Scott: Well, I think if Magfest fixed itself, right, they fixed some of their logistical situations, professionalism.

1315
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,317
Rym: Move to a real venue.

1316
00:58:36,561 --> 00:58:41,880
Scott: Yeah, I would be willing to go back if it improved and give it, you know, another shot just because it was a lot of fun going on there.

1317
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,539
Scott: I don't know if I'd take Thursday off work, I might go Thursday after work.

1318
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,259
Rym: Not maybe.

1319
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:49,160
Scott: But yeah, I mean, you know, it was sort of, it's sort of on the borderline, right?

1320
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,440
Scott: It wasn't, it had big problems, terrible reg, terrible BO.

1321
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,840
Rym: But it gets a lot of points for just the fact that I don't go to any hotel cons.

1322
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,820
Rym: I want one hotel con in my repertoire every year.

1323
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:03,760
Scott: Yeah, so if, you know, if they keep upping their game, you know, I'll keep going back and helping them up their game.

1324
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,412
Scott: But if it gets worse or stays the same, I don't think I can.

1325
00:59:06,694 --> 00:59:08,780
Scott: I can invest, you know, in it as much.

1326
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,600
Rym: That red line was unforgivable.

1327
00:59:10,969 --> 00:59:11,116
Scott: Yeah.

1328
00:59:11,821 --> 00:59:14,900
Rym: And I worry because they're at a point where their venue sucks.

1329
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:15,636
Rym: They have to move.

1330
00:59:15,941 --> 00:59:17,566
Rym: They'll have to move into D.C.

1331
00:59:18,509 --> 00:59:22,180
Rym: where suddenly the laws are much more like real cities.

1332
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,487
Rym: They can't get away with the B.S.

1333
00:59:23,507 --> 00:59:25,760
Rym: they got away with in Alexandria, Virginia.

1334
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:26,191
Scott: Yeah.

1335
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:31,844
Scott: We'll see if their professionalism is the is the doom of them or lack their lack of professional.

1336
00:59:31,864 --> 00:59:33,119
Rym: because we can say this.

1337
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:40,459
Rym: Tim, the guy runs panels, knew what he was doing, like like every problem that we could have pointed out, he was already aware of and wanted to fix.

1338
00:59:41,101 --> 00:59:47,151
Rym: Yeah, but it's a kind of a Katsucon situation where like video Katsu, the guys we were with was like its own unit.

1339
00:59:47,171 --> 00:59:48,200
Rym: that itself was competent.

1340
00:59:48,562 --> 00:59:51,540
Rym: But much of the rest of Katsucon had serious problems that eventually exploded.

1341
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,660
Scott: We definitely heard whisperings and mumblings of drama in the high level.

1342
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,280
Rym: We will not get into the things that we know that we have learned from going to Magfest.

1343
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,219
Rym: There is some crazy drama.

1344
01:00:01,381 --> 01:00:03,780
Scott: And also, you know, the number of staff.

1345
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:10,400
Scott: I mean, the culture of staff wasn't like a bad culture, like the Otakon staff culture, but it wasn't a culture professionalism.

1346
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,080
Scott: It's like they had the right attitude about gaming and all that stuff.

1347
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:14,024
Scott: But they didn't.

1348
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:18,719
Scott: they weren't like on top of the game in terms of, you know, let's work really hard to make everything the best.

1349
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,560
Scott: It was more like, oh, man, we made a really good at making a funny commercial.

1350
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:23,560
Scott: Yeah, they're not really good at managing a line.

1351
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:29,540
Rym: But they had a lot of good staff who are new, like old Katsucon staff after the explosion.

1352
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:32,940
Rym: A lot of the people we used to work with at Katsucon were now staff in this.

1353
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,559
Rym: A lot of the really good people.

1354
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:35,022
Rym: Yeah.

1355
01:00:35,063 --> 01:00:36,400
Rym: So we'll see how it goes.

1356
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,346
Rym: It's hard to say.

1357
01:00:37,487 --> 01:00:39,160
Scott: To wait and see on the next Magfest.

1358
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:40,904
Rym: What?

1359
01:00:48,401 --> 01:00:50,540
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1360
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:55,844
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1361
01:00:56,044 --> 01:01:01,105
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1362
01:01:01,346 --> 01:01:04,020
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1363
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:08,740
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1364

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1365
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:16,580
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1366
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,700
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
