00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,769
Rym: It's Tuesday April 5th 2011.

2
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:12,250
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,658
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight the card game.

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:24,907
Scott: Yo me Mario let's do this.

5
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:34,128
Rym: Over the weekend I was in Racha Chah cold Actually, it was warmer there than it is here right now.

6
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:35,601
Scott: Fuck them right?

7
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:41,630
Rym: Yeah, yeah But got to eat some de bella's and I got to say they have a brand new de bella's like the old one's gone.

8
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,570
Rym: That shopping plaza over there is like the former CompUSA one.

9
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:48,838
Rym: There are so many empty big-box stores around there.

10
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:49,420
Rym: It's kind of crazy.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,504
Scott: How many what's left?

12
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,948
Scott: is the computer Renaissance still there?

13
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,763
Rym: No But the de bella's is like where did it move to?

14
00:00:57,165 --> 00:01:01,970
Rym: it's right on Jefferson now like right by all the other stuff like near where the Bruggers used to be and everything.

15
00:01:02,332 --> 00:01:09,079
Rym: Okay, but anyway this de bella's is freaking gigantic Like two stories tall on the inside.

16
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,424
Scott: go upstairs inside of it.

17
00:01:10,464 --> 00:01:10,604
Rym: No.

18
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:12,130
Rym: It's just a gigantic tall ceiling.

19
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,718
Scott: Oh, it always had a pretty tall ceiling.

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,044
Rym: It's way taller.

21
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:21,550
Rym: think twice as tall 20% cooler, but I got to have some de bella's and you know what it's kind of like rewatching Ava every time.

22
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,520
Rym: I think you know what that gay.

23
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,492
Rym: that wasn't as good as What.

24
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:26,181
Scott: are you stupid or like when?

25
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:27,690
Rym: I would you know not that long ago?

26
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,589
Rym: I was like playing Zelda 1 again, and I remembered oh wait one of the best games ever.

27
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,274
Scott: You just don't learn your lesson.

28
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:33,535
Scott: Dude.

29
00:01:34,017 --> 00:01:36,165
Rym: Yeah, de bella's pretty much has the best subs in the world.

30
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:43,882
Rym: I Don't know about the world Best subs I have ever had short of occasional one-off subs.

31
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:45,306
Rym: Yeah made by experts.

32
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:45,948
Scott: That's right.

33
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:55,110
Rym: I mean but on the way back, uh Feel a little ooky not from de bella's because I shared de bella's with many other people who did not get sick.

34
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:56,435
Scott: Maybe it was.

35
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:58,869
Scott: was there an ingredient in your de bella's that was not in it?

36
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:03,210
Rym: Exact same de bella made by the same person that someone else had and they were fine.

37
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:07,245
Rym: Uh-huh, and Emily had a different de bella that someone else also had.

38
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:11,302
Rym: neither one of them got sick All right, so I yeah horrible food poison.

39
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:12,809
Scott: What did you eat before the de bella?

40
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,981
Rym: Uh a whole bunch of different things.

41
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:16,329
Rym: I can't really.

42
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:20,827
Rym: Maybe it was the raw sprouts mixed with uncooked eggs.

43
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:21,329
Scott: That's it?

44
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:23,235
Scott: I don't know.

45
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:24,141
Scott: That's the one.

46
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:28,430
Rym: but yeah Horrible food poisoning didn't go to work yesterday.

47
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:39,870
Rym: the best part of this is I like rock climb and Ski and bike and rollerblade and I do all this stuff and I'm trying to learn parkour and I'm kind of an active guy.

48
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:47,319
Rym: You'd think when I injure myself the inevitable day when I seriously injure myself It will be because I was doing something dangerous.

49
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:53,741
Rym: No, in fact, I threw my back out so bad I couldn't walk on Sunday in the course of vomiting.

50
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:57,074
Rym: Yeah, I vomited so violently I threw out my back.

51
00:02:57,616 --> 00:02:58,239
Scott: that'll happen.

52
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:03,418
Rym: The worst part is and think about this I vomit in the course of vomiting.

53
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:04,300
Rym: I throw out my back.

54
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,610
Rym: I fall over backwards and proceed to continue vomiting.

55
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:11,537
Rym: That was that was my lowest moment There.

56
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:13,290
Rym: there is very much a little lower than that.

57
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:21,830
Rym: He didn't suffocate on the vomit because at least the last time I got horrible food poisoning I was hospitalized before I fell over backwards vomiting.

58
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:24,496
Scott: You seem to have a trend here.

59
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,105
Rym: my body's first my go-to thing.

60
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,151
Rym: if there's any trouble my body's like What do we do?

61
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:29,713
Rym: vomit?

62
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,623
Scott: I'll resist bargaining until the end of days.

63
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:33,345
Rym: I will too.

64
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:34,790
Rym: My body has other ideas.

65
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,257
Rym: It's expert system is like is there a problem?

66
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,343
Rym: Can this be solved by vomiting vomit?

67
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:41,670
Scott: Anyway, my streak is now very long.

68
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:51,770
Rym: So, yeah, that was awesome man, I missed work good job and today I feel great But I think that's because I ate solid food for the first time in two days.

69
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:52,814
Scott: That's a good thing.

70
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:53,496
Rym: Yeah.

71
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,444
Rym: Yeah, that's all also.

72
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:57,130
Rym: no fucking my little pony on Friday.

73
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:59,285
Scott: No, maybe this Friday.

74
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:04,042
Rym: It better be There better be I don't know I don't know what I'll do.

75
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:05,650
Rym: send an angry letter to Hasbro.

76
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,573
Rym: I've already talked to them.

77
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:08,561
Rym: They have no interest in.

78
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:10,969
Scott: it says here a bird in the hoof April 8th.

79
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:16,096
Rym: Now I wonder is Celestia Purposefully neglecting her bird?

80
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:22,890
Scott: or is she angry that they intervene such that they have to cover Tries to help the princess sick bird without her permission and the ponies help smooth it over?

81
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,914
Scott: Yeah, smooth it over.

82
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:24,195
Rym: that.

83
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:28,070
Rym: that implies that Celestia might not be a hundred percent on the up-and-up.

84
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:31,690
Scott: I think it's one of those situations where she doesn't mind that she helped the bird.

85
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,190
Scott: It's that she broke some other rule in the course of helping the bird like going into a forbidden area.

86
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:39,347
Rym: Ah, you know the forbidden gulag where Luna's locked up.

87
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:47,086
Rym: Yes anyway, so Because I had food poisoning and I couldn't even lie down because I also hurt my back.

88
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:50,509
Rym: I Sat on the couch poking to my xbox all day.

89
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,859
Rym: So I bought shadow complex and played a whole bunch of it.

90
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:53,723
Rym: It was pretty good.

91
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:59,627
Rym: Like you said it's kind of But it's not long enough now, which is fine because I don't have the patience.

92
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:03,430
Scott: if it was longer I would have had the patience for if it was longer.

93
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,290
Scott: But I don't have the patience to play the same game to get a hundred percent completion in the same areas over and over again.

94
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:12,583
Rym: I think it's more that I have more patience for a very long game like that.

95
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:17,190
Rym: if it's not a portable like Castlevania I'll pretty much play that forever.

96
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,670
Rym: I could have play an infinite Castlevania and never get bored with it because I can play it like on the subway.

97
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,642
Rym: But if I'm at home, I have so many more things I can do that.

98
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:39,746
Rym: I really don't have patience for Metroidvania Mm-hmm, but I also noticed that the demo for the new Russian attack was there so I played that all the way through and There is not nearly enough rushing Coupled with the fact that the attacking is not so fun.

99
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:44,346
Rym: Really It's basically a shitty version of casual castle crashers with no 3d.

100
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:44,949
Rym: It's just 2d.

101
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:48,529
Rym: So you walk up to a guy and it's like heavy attack light attack block.

102
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:53,185
Scott: But the original Russian attack people don't know that game, but that was like some great game.

103
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:54,630
Scott: You just you couldn't stop rushing.

104
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:55,533
Scott: It's just rush.

105
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:59,225
Scott: and it was constant attacking and if you didn't constantly attack there was dying.

106
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:00,749
Scott: Yeah a lot of it.

107
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:04,284
Rym: For me that game was basically rushing to the game genie.

108
00:06:04,304 --> 00:06:06,596
Rym: I Never beat it legit.

109
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:08,446
Rym: I never even got close to beating it legit.

110
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:09,069
Rym: Fuck that game.

111
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:11,216
Rym: But Russian attack.

112
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:15,668
Rym: expatriate tried to make a plot like a for serious plot.

113
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:17,513
Scott: That is basically Why do you need a plot?

114
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:17,994
Scott: Here's the plot.

115
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:18,375
Scott: you ready?

116
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:19,599
Rym: Go go go.

117
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,604
Rym: Russian attack the Russians.

118
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:22,727
Rym: Yeah, that's the game.

119
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:27,613
Rym: go go go No, but basically there's no Go.

120
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:29,137
Rym: so tell me if you see.

121
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:30,722
Rym: tell me if you've heard this plot.

122
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:35,356
Rym: before a meteor strikes somewhere in Russia It causes a crystal to grow.

123
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:37,123
Rym: that crystal is mad energy.

124
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:38,327
Rym: the Russians harvest it.

125
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:39,170
Scott: Yeah, I've heard that.

126
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:41,157
Rym: Yeah, that's the plot.

127
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:46,640
Rym: All right, and then I'm in a prison and there's all this dialogue I just don't care about.

128
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:48,190
Rym: and then they let me out of the prison.

129
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,314
Scott: Why is there dialogue?

130
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:52,344
Scott: the game should consist of nothing but rushing and also attack.

131
00:06:52,424 --> 00:07:02,823
Rym: so I stab motherfuckers ending No, stopping no walking and in the course of stabbing motherfuckers I have two choices at all junctures stealth or not stealth.

132
00:07:02,884 --> 00:07:03,746
Scott: Why is there stealth?

133
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:05,454
Scott: It's not hide and attack It's rush.

134
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:08,150
Rym: The game is pretty much like yeah, you want to hide everywhere.

135
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:13,250
Rym: We're gonna give you like a thousand different hide buttons and only to stab motherfucker buttons.

136
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:14,140
Scott: What the fuck.

137
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,970
Scott: who made this game?

138
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,952
Scott: I found a grenade.

139
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:20,430
Scott: really someone just took the name Russian attack and made some other game that was not Russian.

140
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:20,651
Scott: It's a.

141
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:26,110
Rym: they really focused on Russians as in the nationality as opposed to like that, but it's not Russian.

142
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,853
Scott: Are you SS?

143
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:27,576
Scott: I a N?

144
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:28,460
Scott: do they read it wrong?

145
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,841
Scott: Because it's.

146
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:29,825
Scott: are you SS?

147
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:30,006
Scott: it's.

148
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:30,568
Scott: are you sh?

149
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,378
Scott: Apostrophe n?

150
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,790
Scott: yes in you are rushing.

151
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:40,884
Scott: I'm an American soldier in a gulag Stabbing motherfuckers in Russia as in rush and like, you know toys are us.

152
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,970
Scott: is his rush and attack?

153
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:46,090
Rym: Yeah, you really don't run a rush because then you get caught by bad guys.

154
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,969
Rym: You really want to crouch down and sneak and hide in the hole.

155
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:54,647
Rym: If you want to hide in the door you hit up but if you want to hide in the hole you hit.

156
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:55,249
Rym: why?

157
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,150
Scott: yeah I'm not playing this now.

158
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,496
Rym: Oh, yeah health packs - but you know what?

159
00:07:57,516 --> 00:08:00,730
Rym: I will play packs that you have to use explicitly within d-pad.

160
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:02,135
Scott: You know what though?

161
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:08,590
Rym: I got every night vision that basically you turn it on when you need it and you turn it off When you don't need it, and it doesn't do anything interesting.

162
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:13,890
Scott: I got ROMs of every NES Gameboy and Gameboy color game ever on my DS piracy card.

163
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:17,629
Rym: I should really get a DS piracy car and now I can play Russian attack.

164
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:21,819
Rym: Yeah, I am so not impressed with Russian attack.

165
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,973
Rym: expatriate that I. it's difficult to describe to you how Uncomfortably bad it would.

166
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:28,916
Rym: not bad not bad.

167
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,863
Rym: if it was bad it would be more fun.

168
00:08:30,883 --> 00:08:33,049
Rym: It's just so desperately mediocre.

169
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:39,929
Rym: To quote Wikipedia players will be able to perform shank combos in addition to the stealth kills.

170
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:42,335
Scott: Why the stealth kills?

171
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:43,960
Rym: the game is all about shanking.

172
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,070
Rym: you realize you just have a knife and you have like a thousand ways.

173
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,710
Scott: But in Russian attack didn't you have like a rocket launchers and machine guns and all sorts of ridiculous.

174
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,830
Rym: Well until you run out of ammo and then it's knives till the end.

175
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,788
Scott: I know that but I'm saying there were rocket launchers and machine guns available to you.

176
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:01,550
Rym: Yeah, so screw this game All right.

177
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,200
Rym: Just if you want a game like this play Bionic Commando rearmed.

178
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,670
Rym: if you didn't that game is why everything you want.

179
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,212
Scott: I get it better.

180
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:07,353
Scott: Do you?

181
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:09,862
Scott: why don't you play Russian attack for the NES?

182
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:11,850
Rym: Why don't you play Bionic Commando for the NES?

183
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:15,045
Scott: I played some bad commander for the Gameboy.

184
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:15,709
Scott: Let me tell you.

185
00:09:18,473 --> 00:09:19,241
Rym: So what do you got for me?

186
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:22,283
Scott: so You know Jane McGonagall right.

187
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:23,010
Scott: she did the keynote.

188
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:24,033
Rym: Oh, yeah, she did.

189
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:25,518
Scott: she made this game.

190
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,227
Scott: And if you're in New York, you can play this game bark ball.

191
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:30,153
Rym: No Chicken bowling.

192
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:36,290
Scott: No, it's called find the future and you play it at the library the New York Public Library the big one.

193
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:38,570
Rym: Do I research science and try to better the world?

194
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:44,007
Scott: I don't know what the hell you do but you basically go to the library and you go to this website and you you do whatever it says.

195
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,334
Scott: and then 500 people.

196
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:57,590
Scott: on May 20th 2011 Which is in 44 days 9 hours 23 minutes and some seconds from now at the time of this recording Smart listeners you can figure out exactly when we recorded GeekNights.

197
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:06,189
Scott: 500 people Are gonna stay overnight at the Stephen a Schwartzman building and become the first in the world to play a new game.

198
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,136
Scott: Find the future.

199
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:10,043
Rym: Oh, wait a minute New York Public Library.

200
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:12,314
Rym: Yeah, I work right next to that I know.

201
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:16,970
Scott: so if you have to go to the library and You know do this play the game.

202
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,933
Scott: That's on the website.

203
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:27,439
Scott: submit your entry and then 500 people who enter are gonna play the game again the real game I guess on May 20th, okay Overnight at the library.

204
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,310
Rym: I'm spending my lunch over there to tomorrow.

205
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,129
Scott: Yes, this is looking pretty good to me.

206
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,294
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

207
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:41,237
Rym: also as a random aside if you weren't at PAX or if you were stupid didn't go to the keynote I'll try to find a link to it.

208
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:43,649
Rym: You should be able to find her keynote from PAX.

209
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,670
Rym: It was pretty damn amazing.

210
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,232
Scott: You had a lot of crossover with her TED talk though If you've seen that it did but in her book if you've read that but it was obvious a lot of the people in the audience Had not.

211
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:57,288
Rym: what scares me is how many people at our panels did not go to the keynote.

212
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,250
Rym: Yeah Despite the fact that there was a simulcast.

213
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,630
Rym: So while the keynote filled up like you couldn't get in as far as I can tell there was plenty of space in the figure.

214
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:09,805
Scott: Anyone who was there that wasn't at the keynote was one of those expo hall type of people.

215
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:13,140
Scott: or they had some other Conflicting panel that they cared more about.

216
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,185
Scott: so they were not, you know, or they were playing games So they weren't likely to watch a simulcast.

217
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:30,520
Rym: Yeah Yeah, anyway, so things of the day it turns out now.

218
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:33,087
Rym: I didn't read the study behind this.

219
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:38,280
Rym: I am quoting an article that is talking about an article from the Journal of experimental social psychology.

220
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:54,820
Rym: but supposedly there is evidence that if you are thinking about Being high as in physically higher than some arbitrary reference point You are more likely to cooperate and be altruistic in general.

221
00:11:55,362 --> 00:12:08,642
Rym: So if you put say a Salvation Army bin at the top of an escalator or stairway people are 50% more likely to give than if you put it at the bottom of an escalator or elevator or stairs or ramp or Anything.

222
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:14,080
Rym: it even applies to showing people a video of flying versus a video of walking or driving.

223
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:14,862
Scott: Uh-huh.

224
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:20,300
Rym: I bring this up on a Tuesday because one of the panels we did at PAX was game mechanics and mechanism design.

225
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,020
Rym: You know the whole idea that you can design a game that will cause certain behaviors in the play.

226
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,260
Scott: You should put the in-game charity bucket at the top of the in-game escalator.

227
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,600
Rym: No, you should have a picture of the sky at the end of your demo with a button that says buy the game.

228
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:40,626
Scott: Yeah, you get people go up the stairs at the end of the game before you give them the part You know the buy full version button.

229
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,349
Scott: That's a good idea.

230
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:44,360
Rym: There appears to be evidence that that would probably work.

231
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,400
Scott: Probably so I make sure there's birds going.

232
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:50,550
Rym: Now think about this for everything cookie Brigade.

233
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,200
Rym: You got to be at the top of every one of those escalators.

234
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,589
Scott: Just well, I mean the cookie braid already sells all the cookies.

235
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:59,116
Rym: true true, but they could possibly get more money.

236
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:06,640
Rym: Oh If you need a player to play diplomacy with you get them into the game at the top of an escalator.

237
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:08,380
Scott: Yeah, you should be looking for game.

238
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,840
Scott: People should be at the top of escalators and stairs being like one play one play one play.

239
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:13,326
Rym: I wonder if we can apply this.

240
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:17,100
Rym: we're thinking about doing a show on it because you know out there your German board game players.

241
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:22,592
Rym: There's the problem where nobody wants to play a wooden cube game Until they play it and then they love it.

242
00:13:22,612 --> 00:13:27,440
Rym: I Feel like we need to use this like shit like walk up to someone show them a picture of an airplane.

243
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,418
Rym: They'd be like do you want to play a wooden cube game?

244
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:38,359
Scott: Maybe we should just try wooden cube games that have themes of sky and airplanes and such while playing that song sky-high from dance dance revolution.

245
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,217
Rym: Maybe this is why we like Rainbow Dash so much, too.

246
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:56,767
Rym: So, yeah, I thought this was cool and you know It's kind of a reminder that psychology and game mechanics and mechanism design and games are all Pretty much cut from the same cloth.

247
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:01,643
Rym: The only difference is that mechanism design uses a lot more math All right.

248
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:04,675
Scott: So have you ever heard of a person named Peter Edkison?

249
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:09,370
Rym: Uh My brain says yes, but yeah, he's an important person.

250
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,940
Scott: He was the founder and first CEO of wizards of the coast.

251
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:18,375
Scott: he's also currently the president Gen Con or the owner of Gen Con.

252
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:28,140
Scott: CEO and owner of Gen Con and He you know, he was responsible for uniting D&D and Magic the Gathering under Wizards of the Coast and selling it to Hasbro.

253
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:39,300
Rym: so remember back in the day all the conspiracy people who were like Wizards of the Coast is gonna turn D&D into Magic the Gathering and ruin it But anyway little did they know they would turn it into World of Warcraft.

254
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,453
Scott: He's currently the CEO of hidden city games where they make the Bellis era.

255
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:44,320
Scott: I remember where Luke and Jared were.

256
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,077
Rym: Oh, yeah, who would want to play a game about horses on anyway anyway?

257
00:14:49,722 --> 00:15:01,193
Scott: But here is a very interesting interview with this man where he discusses many things such as purchasing Hasbro and Regretting losing the Pokemon card game license and such-and-such using Hasbro.

258
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:03,219
Rym: You mean being purchased by Hasbro, right?

259
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,660
Scott: exactly?

260
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:05,424
Scott: There was.

261
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:06,810
Scott: there is an interesting.

262
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,360
Scott: I'm gonna give you just one question and answer here.

263
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:10,470
Scott: That's in the middle of the interview.

264
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,520
Scott: that makes it kind of funny, right?

265
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:19,895
Scott: Someone says define fantasy in 25 words or less that the interviewer said that That question has been asked of many people before.

266
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:30,539
Scott: so he says I looked at fantasy for entertaining stories about heroes their beliefs how those beliefs are challenged and dealt with And how that changes the hero.

267
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:36,087
Rym: There's might be a role-playing system he might enjoy.

268
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:38,352
Scott: perhaps perhaps he has heard of it.

269
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:41,300
Scott: perhaps perhaps he employed the creator.

270
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:44,203
Scott: You Should.

271
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:49,339
Scott: I is a good interview worth reading if you are someone who cares about tabletop things.

272
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:55,394
Scott: He also even mentions here the best thing Hasbro has done in the last 10 years.

273
00:15:55,855 --> 00:16:02,774
Scott: big IMO caveat here Is the joint venture with discovery kids to create its own hub children's television channel.

274
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:06,796
Scott: if Hasbro and Wizards can figure out how to leverage The hub together, that would be awesome.

275
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:09,212
Scott: You know what I.

276
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:15,440
Rym: In case anyone is unaware out there, you know new listeners, maybe they don't listen to the other shows.

277
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:23,805
Scott: If they this is a man, this is a man who owns a company that makes a horsey trade card and you try card Trading card game.

278
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:35,737
Rym: if they gave up on the girls and they and they made D&D related shows and just put them on the hub Well D&D comics do real that badly actually I think and they're actually I think it's Paul.

279
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:36,520
Scott: so because they're awful.

280
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:38,300
Rym: Yeah, I think that's the problem.

281
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:42,228
Rym: I feel like there's a way to tap that.

282
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:44,400
Scott: but look at how sorry people who make D&D comics.

283
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:47,130
Scott: But if you don't suck you're doing a sucky job.

284
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:53,693
Rym: I have a feeling I mean look at a penny arcade For example at PAX when they did that we're gonna play D&D on stage.

285
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:55,579
Rym: how crazily popular that stuff is.

286
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:59,251
Rym: Yeah, I feel like you could turn that into a show probably.

287
00:16:59,352 --> 00:16:59,673
Scott: Yeah.

288
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:01,880
Rym: Yeah attack in the darkness and such.

289
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,946
Rym: Yeah, but anyway the meta moment.

290
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:08,099
Rym: we are going to be at anime Boston upcoming in a few weeks doing a whole bunch of panels.

291
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:11,099
Rym: We are going to be at the mocha this weekend.

292
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:15,012
Rym: Yeah, not doing any panels, but we'll be interviewing people our friends.

293
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:15,834
Rym: you going enough.

294
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,135
Rym: Johnny.

295
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:17,339
Rym: Wander will have a table.

296
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,409
Scott: They're having a table.

297
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,076
Rym: Whoa Finally after like five years of us saying they should get a table.

298
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:25,760
Rym: They have a table Oh snap, so you should go find them and pester them.

299
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:27,999
Rym: We should come up with something weird for you to say to them.

300
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:30,692
Scott: Everyone should go up and do the same thing to them.

301
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:31,616
Scott: Like what's the thing?

302
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:37,000
Scott: It has to be something Weird enough to where I gotta get you go to draw ponies as many ponies as possible.

303
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,295
Rym: That's that's self-interested.

304
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:42,487
Rym: All right, guys Your mission is to trick.

305
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:47,420
Rym: you go and enough into drawing pictures of ponies and then scan them in and give them to us.

306
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,639
Scott: We need to you go and on mocha pony collection.

307
00:17:52,123 --> 00:17:54,380
Scott: As many my little ponies as you know.

308
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:57,440
Rym: You cannot tell them that we put you up to that.

309
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,538
Rym: Just tell them that you really want them to and that a little bird told you that they were just be like.

310
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:06,074
Scott: just say that You're a huge fan of my little ponies and then you know that.

311
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:09,739
Scott: you know with her art style She would you know that we she would draw an amazing one.

312
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:15,477
Rym: This will also tell us if they listen to GeekNights in a timely manner or not.

313
00:18:15,497 --> 00:18:19,330
Scott: I don't think they did Occasionally, I believe they do.

314
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:29,694
Rym: I don't know our friends listen far less than all of you know The book club book which we'll be talking about on Thursday was Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

315
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:31,358
Scott: many of you is probably tomorrow.

316
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:39,180
Rym: Yes Also on May 1st, it is outdoor fucking day.

317
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,050
Rym: You got something.

318
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,476
Scott: come on, yeah, I can't get the page to load.

319
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:57,533
Rym: we submitted our panels for Otakon So we'll see if we're going there.

320
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:02,206
Rym: Pax prime is Five months or so away.

321
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:04,393
Rym: We will be doing panels at it.

322
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:06,620
Rym: There is also I'm going to say a word.

323
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:09,800
Rym: I'm not going to say anything about it because I can't.

324
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:11,384
Rym: Pax dev.

325
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:12,368
Scott: we don't know what that is.

326
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:15,280
Rym: We don't know what that is, but it is something.

327
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,590
Rym: All right, it is something that it might happen someday.

328
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,673
Scott: It might never happen.

329
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:20,214
Rym: Yes.

330
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:22,020
Scott: It's a word that I heard.

331
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,400
Scott: I don't know anything else about the world.

332
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,260
Rym: The word was passed to us some time ago with no further information.

333
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,420
Scott: All right.

334
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:32,928
Scott: So yeah, I'm a. do you say enemy Boston already?

335
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:39,900
Scott: Yes, okay on May 21st and 22nd in New York City There is going to be bar camp.

336
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:44,800
Scott: So the registration information will appear at some point.

337
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:54,420
Scott: But if you go to the bar camp NYC Twitter account There is a link to where you can sign up to be notified of when you'll be able to register.

338
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:58,212
Scott: So do that if you are New York City person you want to go to bar camp.

339
00:19:58,915 --> 00:20:00,339
Scott: I'm helping organize it.

340
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,002
Scott: It's gonna be good.

341
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:10,020
Rym: So I enjoyed Street Fighter and RTS's and you know fighting games, but what are the?

342
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:16,497
Rym: Well, they're the same thing basically Just a higher level, but I think they're mostly the same.

343
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:25,111
Rym: They're more Execution matters more than strategy at the low levels in some of the games Yes, and at the high level strategy matters only because execution is perfect.

344
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:25,632
Rym: That's right.

345
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:28,540
Rym: But I am ass at these games.

346
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:36,127
Rym: I am so bad at Street Fighter that despite spending a lot of time Practicing and trying to become good.

347
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:45,620
Scott: I'm trivially dispatched by even what I would consider low ranking players Yeah, I mean there there are games, you know such as jungle speed which are pure execution, right?

348
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:47,448
Scott: No strategy jungle speed.

349
00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:49,980
Rym: Well, there is technically the strategy strategy.

350
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,727
Scott: Here's the strategy execute perfectly.

351
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:53,252
Rym: if I match someone else.

352
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,260
Rym: I will grab the totem before they do.

353
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:55,762
Scott: There's no.

354
00:20:55,802 --> 00:20:56,766
Scott: but this there is no.

355
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:58,413
Scott: no one has any different strategies.

356
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,000
Scott: Everyone has the optimal strategy.

357
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:03,752
Rym: I do have a secondary strategy that not everyone has colors.

358
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:04,876
Rym: colors match.

359
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:06,000
Rym: It's a match match.

360
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:09,157
Scott: The point is that a game like jungle speed.

361
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:10,400
Rym: There's no talking in jungle.

362
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:14,735
Scott: Execution is everything and the winner is determined purely by execute.

363
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:20,155
Rym: I mean, I have a strategy in hockey I take the biscuit and I put it in the bed as much as I can.

364
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:21,700
Scott: in other games, right?

365
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,825
Scott: There it strategy dominates right?

366
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,055
Scott: So, you know in diplomacy there pretty much is no execution.

367
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:28,138
Scott: Yeah whatsoever.

368
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:33,700
Rym: It's all Strategy, actually, I would argue that diplomacy is nothing but execution of applied psychology.

369
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:35,284
Scott: Whatever.

370
00:21:35,305 --> 00:21:41,131
Scott: the point is that there it's not you know a sport or Locking the door before Scott Johnson gets back to put in his order.

371
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:41,432
Rym: Sure.

372
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,780
Scott: Whatever right other games, right?

373
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,171
Scott: I have a mixture of the two.

374
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:47,785
Scott: for example football Is the foot?

375
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,660
Scott: is the strategy and the execution mixed together, however?

376
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:56,720
Scott: In some games right where there were even when the two factors are present, right?

377
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:59,411
Scott: One of the factors has been mastered.

378
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:12,000
Scott: For example, there are many games Where for example baseball there is execution and strategy in baseball But people have mastered the strategy such that only the execution matters at high levels of play.

379
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:15,040
Scott: At low levels of play people still haven't mastered the strategy.

380
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,931
Scott: So both things still matter right but at high levels.

381
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:20,340
Scott: in Major League Baseball only execution really matters.

382
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:24,892
Scott: Right and such in like fighting games like Street Fighter, right?

383
00:22:24,932 --> 00:22:26,677
Scott: There is execution and strategy.

384
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:27,800
Scott: both come into effect.

385
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:36,005
Scott: however at the highest levels Execution has largely been perfected and only the strategy Mostly matters.

386
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:46,479
Scott: at the highest levels right of things like Street Fighter and RTS is right Whereas on the low levels of Street Fighter and RTS is both Execution and strategy matter because neither one of them have been mastered.

387
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:51,870
Rym: now imagine if you took Street Fighter 4, let's say championship edition and Championship edition.

388
00:22:52,031 --> 00:23:01,572
Rym: Yeah super super And made it where execution didn't matter where I input my string of moves and we take turns And you can take as long as you want.

389
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:06,675
Scott: Yep, like alright I'm gonna throw a Hadoken and if you don't tell the guy that before you do it.

390
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:08,536
Rym: Yeah, but if he comes near me I'm gonna hit.

391
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:12,897
Rym: So Yomi is basically that it's Street Fighter.

392
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:13,540
Rym: the card game.

393
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:18,059
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's made by this guy named Sirlin who has a. he's made he's making a bunch of games.

394
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,160
Scott: now.

395
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,899
Scott: I made this puzzle game with the chips right with something that people are talking about.

396
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,680
Rym: Oh, yeah They were playing that at zinc icon.

397
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:23,861
Rym: yeah,

398
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:35,767
Scott: and basically I kept hearing about this Yomi game and people just kept talking about it and talking about it and then I Saw some people play it once and I noticed that it was also a real deck of cards like, you know Two three four five Jack Queen puzzle

399
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:36,188
Rym: strike.

400
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:37,192
Scott: Yeah, that's the other one.

401
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:41,468
Scott: All right, then this guy also has on his website He wrote a book about playing to win the game.

402
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:49,820
Scott: So we like this guy, but this guy Sirlin I think he's also if I'm not mistaken like, you know a master of mechanism design.

403
00:23:50,061 --> 00:24:02,088
Rym: His site shows at the top your shopping bag is empty and there's a sad looking shopping bag looking at you with big eyes like Yep, and if you put something in it, he's happy.

404
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:02,711
Scott: Yep.

405
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:05,420
Scott: Anyway, but anyway, yeah, this guy knows what he's going on.

406
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,695
Scott: I'm pretty sure he's like a semi professional fighting game guy, but he's yeah,

407
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:08,896
Rym: well

408
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:27,542
Scott: like us He was always upset that pretty much, you know, he's gonna beat the hell out of us at fighting games, but He still was always bothered by the fact that you know, he couldn't execute You know perfectly along with you know The highest highest level guys, even though he felt that he was strategically on the same level or higher level than them He couldn't beat them.

409
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:37,300
Rym: because execution now that is not a flaw in any game because I am of the mind that Execution and elegance of execution is a very fine form of competition.

410
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:45,100
Rym: I mean, it's fantastic the strategy of hockey whatever but the execution of hitting a guy into the boards as hard as you can without doing A penalty matters to me quite a bit.

411
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:56,407
Rym: I enjoy watching such interplay But there is a place for both and I like the fact that he's considered how to take a game like Street Fighter and bring it down to the low level.

412
00:24:56,447 --> 00:25:00,620
Rym: So someone who does not have the execution abilities can enjoy the high-level strategy.

413
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:08,895
Scott: Yeah, I mean, but basically there is a strategy in Street Fighter But you you can't really access that strategy unless you get really really good at the execution.

414
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:13,627
Scott: and not many people can do that Even many even though many people play Street Fighter.

415
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:18,780
Scott: very few people experience the strategy of Street Fighter because it's inaccessible to them.

416
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,100
Scott: They need to be masters of the joystick before they can get there.

417
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,673
Rym: So he's made a game before you can master the joystick.

418
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:27,400
Rym: You must first master yourself.

419
00:25:27,783 --> 00:25:37,410
Scott: Yeah, he made a game called Yomi which is a card game which has the exact same or nearly the exact same strategic elements and play as Street Fighter or most fighting games.

420
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,295
Rym: you've got your power.

421
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:41,709
Rym: bar your life Yeah, with none of the execution.

422
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,420
Scott: so it doesn't matter if you can't use a joystick for poop.

423
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:52,020
Rym: You can get the same Street Fighter experience unless you're good at close-up magic and you just cheat with the cards.

424
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,528
Scott: Yes, we're assuming no cheating because I've been practicing.

425
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:58,260
Rym: I think I can fairly effectively reveal a card in either direction.

426
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,682
Scott: We'll just play the digital version Hack it.

427
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:03,770
Scott: There's a real digital version.

428
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,854
Scott: It's official on the website.

429
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:05,757
Scott: It's in beta.

430
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:08,970
Scott: I'll hack it Anyway, so what's Yomi all about?

431
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,420
Scott: so Yomi is a non collectible card game, right?

432
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,782
Scott: Where each deck of there's decks of cards is ten of them and you can buy sets of two or you can buy the full Set.

433
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:18,853
Scott: the full sets really expensive.

434
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:20,000
Scott: It's like a hundred something dollars.

435
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:24,600
Scott: Right, but the individual like, you know to buy just two decks is like 20 something.

436
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:30,703
Rym: my suggestion to distribute the cost and to make sure you like it is do what we did and buy one set of two and play the Game a couple times.

437
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:35,820
Rym: if you're intrigued at all trick one of your idiot friends into buying a set of two different characters.

438
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,111
Scott: No, it's non collectible non customizable.

439
00:26:38,131 --> 00:26:39,297
Scott: It's not magically gathering.

440
00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:43,800
Scott: It's not yugioh It's not Pokemon, but each individual deck is a different character.

441
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:47,609
Scott: So think of it like, you know This deck is guile and this deck is M bison.

442
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:52,138
Scott: in this deck is Chun Li and originally I'm pretty sure he wanted the street Fighter license, but he couldn't get it.

443
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:59,260
Scott: So he just made up characters and the first set is fantasy strike And I think the next set is gonna be something else, right?

444
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,260
Scott: So each set is gonna be a different, you know setting with different characters.

445
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:06,708
Scott: So when the next set comes out you have you know Ten more characters.

446
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:08,200
Scott: next that comes out your ten more characters.

447
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:12,340
Rym: It has all the aesthetics of a video fight as the stupid plot of a fighting game.

448
00:27:12,842 --> 00:27:14,508
Rym: It has the characters and the backstory.

449
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:15,833
Rym: the characters are all kind of absurd.

450
00:27:15,853 --> 00:27:17,680
Rym: It is everything you would expect.

451
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:18,524
Scott: Yep, it is.

452
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:20,394
Scott: It is exactly like a fighting game in every way.

453
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:21,420
Scott: Here's how the game works, right?

454
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,980
Scott: You take your deck of cards, which is also a regular deck of cards, you know, 52 plus 2 jokers, right?

455
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:36,120
Scott: You shuffle it up You draw seven and every turn you play rock-paper-scissors and the rock-paper-scissors is pretty much either attack throw or block dodge.

456
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:42,714
Scott: Right, so block dodge beats attack Attack beats throw and throw beats block and dodge, right?

457
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:45,431
Rym: So you play rock-paper-scissors Kind of like a fighting game.

458
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:50,939
Scott: Yeah, just like a fighting game and if you win the rock-paper-scissors, then you get to do a bunch of damage possibly.

459
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:55,800
Scott: but First if before you do a combo, right?

460
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,800
Scott: Which is how you would do even more damage the other person gets to bluff.

461
00:27:59,383 --> 00:28:06,131
Scott: They can put a card face down and bluff which is like a ha ha Right, and that ha ha ha is pretty much like either.

462
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:10,959
Scott: It's like, okay, you can risk doing a combo But if I'm not bluffing your combos gonna be a waste.

463
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:14,616
Rym: The best part though is that it the dynamics are like a fighting game.

464
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:18,931
Rym: attacks have speed If two if attack hits attack the faster one gets through.

465
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:27,880
Rym: and you have this combo system where if you hit someone once You know, I poke M bison with my jab, I then lay in with the combo into my ender that knocks him down.

466
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:34,950
Scott: Yeah, but if he was bluffing that combo is just gonna be a big waste and he'll block the rest of the combo even though The first or if I dodge I get to counter.

467
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,360
Rym: but if I block then I get other things.

468
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:42,808
Scott: But but if you block a special attack, you still take a little bit of chip damage Yeah, and some characters they're.

469
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:45,200
Rym: the damage that goes through the block is substantial.

470
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,860
Scott: Yeah, and every character has different attacks different special abilities, right certain cards.

471
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:53,854
Scott: You know every card actually has two abilities on it, right so you play.

472
00:28:53,874 --> 00:28:57,132
Rym: we pick which way you want it to face And like one sides attack one sides dodge.

473
00:28:57,313 --> 00:28:58,500
Scott: Yep and special attack.

474
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:07,601
Scott: Some of them are the same thing on both sides, but some of them have two different abilities like, you know The fish man, he can either do a bubble shield or you can do like some crazy attack with the other side of the same Card.

475
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:10,473
Rym: it's a complete information game and that you know the full.

476
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:12,080
Scott: No, you don't know what the other part Scott.

477
00:29:12,342 --> 00:29:14,480
Rym: Yes, it's not a perfect information game.

478
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,480
Rym: It is a complete information game because you know the entirety of the strategies available to both characters.

479
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:21,280
Scott: No, cuz you don't know what cards he has in his hand.

480
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,319
Scott: You don't know is a block even possible for him this turn?

481
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:28,076
Rym: But you know the total array of possible strategies and you know.

482
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:34,179
Scott: what you know Is that the certain strategy might be impossible if he does at that time, but it is theoretically possible at any point.

483
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,040
Rym: Theoretically, it's not perfect information.

484
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,689
Scott: Well, you think you'd have to know what's in his hands got.

485
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:46,595
Rym: complete information simply means you basically means that you know The rules of the game and you know the rules both players are playing by.

486
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:48,784
Scott: you do know the rules Perfect information.

487
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:50,493
Scott: you look to the other guy's deck and know all his.

488
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:58,570
Rym: yes means that you know Every decision that has been made up to this point and there are no simultaneous decisions Mm-hmm, and this game is nothing but simultaneous decisions.

489
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,173
Scott: That's right.

490
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:02,785
Scott: And there's also lots of hidden cards and Pretty much that's it.

491
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:06,620
Rym: I mean the characters all have neat powers like Lum the gambling panda.

492
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,420
Rym: It's just like we only have four the characters.

493
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,224
Scott: So I don't know about the other six, you know But the ones we have.

494
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:13,133
Scott: we got the regular people the red and blue this.

495
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:17,029
Scott: they seem to be like the main and we have Lizard man equivalents the weirdo characters.

496
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:17,190
Rym: Yes.

497
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,374
Scott: It's a random panda.

498
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,402
Scott: and the defensive fish man Who is?

499
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:21,772
Rym: I love the defensive fish man.

500
00:30:21,793 --> 00:30:22,739
Scott: fish man's pretty good.

501
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,860
Scott: He does two damage every single round no matter what unless he's knocked down.

502
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,045
Rym: My only worry is that we played a whole bunch of times and the blue guy and the first deck you bought is so far Is undefeated by a wide margin?

503
00:30:32,145 --> 00:30:36,839
Scott: No, I think the the red girl won once when I played at board game night.

504
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:37,705
Scott: Ah How about that?

505
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:38,210
Scott: All right.

506
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:41,715
Rym: Yeah The blue guy is that one combo that does like 45 damage.

507
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,740
Scott: Well, no, it's one move that does 45 damage, but you need to have three aces, right?

508
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,985
Scott: That's another cool thing about.

509
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:53,760
Scott: the game is like it has all these mechanics that so Perfectly represent mechanics and fighting games, right?

510
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,140
Scott: If you do a combo of regular attacks Then you get to search your deck to get aces which are always your best attack.

511
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:03,540
Scott: You can discard pairs three of a kind and four of a kind to go search for aces.

512
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:12,160
Scott: You can do all these things to go get aces out of your deck and that's basically the equivalent of powering up the EX meter At the bottom of the screen in any fighting game, right, you know.

513
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:19,420
Scott: And that way even though you might have used all your cards already You can go dig for the aces to get you know to get more so you can keep unleashing your best attack.

514
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,720
Scott: You know your ultra your super or whatever, even though you've already used it.

515
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,000
Rym: You also draw aces if you chain together long combos.

516
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:31,520
Rym: I said that already but the bet the big part is that different characters have different limits on combos.

517
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,846
Rym: Like the panda only has four.

518
00:31:32,906 --> 00:31:33,970
Rym: the fish man has three.

519
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:36,280
Rym: one character has like five or six.

520
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:41,835
Scott: Yeah, I think that some of the characters, you know Every character has a particular strategy is Valerie has more than anyone.

521
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:46,372
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is Some of the characters right are just pretty from what I hear.

522
00:31:46,453 --> 00:31:48,080
Scott: they're just win against other characters.

523
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,379
Scott: You know It's sort of like a rock versus before you even start.

524
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:56,749
Scott: Like if you take the guy who's all about blocking and you take the other guy who's all about getting through blocks Well, guess who's gonna win most of the time?

525
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:56,970
Rym: Yeah.

526
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,453
Rym: Well, you know what?

527
00:31:57,473 --> 00:31:58,640
Rym: It's kind of like a fighting game.

528
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,077
Scott: Yeah, it is kind of.

529
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:05,297
Scott: you know If you see the other guy chooses a character and you see what character he chooses you can pick a character.

530
00:32:05,338 --> 00:32:09,995
Rym: that's strong against Character but then they'll pick a different character and it's the same problem.

531
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:11,240
Rym: and I wonder what would happen.

532
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:13,297
Rym: It's like a fighting game panda vs.

533
00:32:13,317 --> 00:32:13,660
Rym: Panda.

534
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:17,399
Scott: Yeah, if you got two decks, I see no reason why you couldn't do that.

535
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:19,168
Scott: You know, you just had to get.

536
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:21,567
Scott: even if you think is you can't even do that You buy the full set.

537
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:23,000
Scott: you did buy two full sets to do that.

538
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:29,579
Rym: That's why I'm saying just everyone who cares about this game If your friends like it is get each one of them to buy one of the sets of two.

539
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:39,180
Scott: Well, if I all go in and buy the box and split it up The box does come with like mats to play on and life counters and that sort of extra stuff if you want it.

540
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,114
Scott: So it's not a total waste to get the to get the fancy full box.

541
00:32:42,174 --> 00:32:43,360
Rym: The mats are stupid.

542
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,660
Scott: Yeah, no, I don't even know why you need mats.

543
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,773
Scott: But you know life counters would be good because we keep using paper to count life.

544
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:54,319
Scott: or you know cell phone cell phones And it's not the most convenient thing.

545
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:55,180
Scott: counters.

546
00:32:55,421 --> 00:33:00,353
Scott: you know 2d 10 is what you really want to get to count your life in this game because every character basically has a.

547
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:07,626
Rym: I wouldn't mind just playing it on a smartphone The whole game on a smartphone.

548
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,136
Scott: Yeah, I see no reason why they couldn't do that.

549
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:12,485
Scott: Yeah That'd be pretty cool.

550
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:13,188
Rym: They would.

551
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,590
Scott: and one of the one of the things I don't like about this game though I guess it's sort of mandatory.

552
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,260
Scott: I said it's two-player, right?

553
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,893
Scott: It's like I sort of wish it was more than two players somehow.

554
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:23,280
Scott: That would be totally cool.

555
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:31,008
Rym: It would be possible if they made another set which obviously is probably gonna happen to have rules for like Alright - on - and like here's.

556
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:33,100
Scott: you can have tournaments that you know.

557
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,080
Scott: You could take any of the Street Fighter multi-play modes Johnny Cage versus Johnny Cage.

558
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:39,653
Scott: He could have knockout mode where.

559
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:40,668
Scott: basically, you know You have.

560
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:46,840
Scott: you know You have two teams and the team's the weakest guy in each team fights and the winner fights the next guy or you play where?

561
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,150
Rym: You both have two characters and just have a make up a rule where you tag out.

562
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:56,728
Rym: We mean tag out like I tag out to my other character by spending an action The car you the other guy.

563
00:33:56,748 --> 00:33:58,860
Scott: so you play it more like more tomorrow versus cap.

564
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,580
Scott: Yeah, and you keep track of the three hip HP's of the characters separately of three decks.

565
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:09,980
Scott: Yeah Three discard piles and three hands and you guys least you can only use one at a time at any given turn.

566
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,447
Scott: I could dig that but what do you have?

567
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:12,492
Scott: but you would just tag you.

568
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,040
Scott: tagging out doesn't cost you anything.

569
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:18,431
Rym: Well, you got to come up with a good way to do it or wait for an official version Which will probably come.

570
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:19,339
Rym: that does stuff like that.

571
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:26,411
Scott: Yeah, I would make it like discard two cards to tag out or you know, something like that Yep, or you have to successfully dodge or block.

572
00:34:26,915 --> 00:34:27,879
Scott: Yeah something like, you know.

573
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:29,466
Scott: Or maybe like.

574
00:34:29,888 --> 00:34:36,112
Scott: if you tag out then you you you know, you cannot You must attack or throw you, you know, you can't.

575
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:37,579
Scott: you know some sort of restriction like that?

576
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:38,505
Scott: I don't know.

577
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:40,800
Scott: But yeah, the game has knockdowns.

578
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,362
Scott: it's got.

579
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:42,705
Scott: you know, it's got some weird.

580
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:44,150
Scott: are some weird rules like the?

581
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:49,585
Scott: if you get knocked down then you can't be blocked by Like something mix-ups.

582
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:54,485
Scott: It's like why it's kind of weird, but it's it explains it pretty clearly on one of the cards To help you out.

583
00:34:54,808 --> 00:34:55,009
Rym: Yep.

584
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:56,320
Rym: I mean it's once you learn it.

585
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,167
Rym: It's actually really straightforward.

586
00:34:58,227 --> 00:35:00,074
Rym: The rules are just like I'll fold out.

587
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:01,520
Rym: magic is way harder than this.

588
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,726
Scott: Oh, yeah, I mean, it's not.

589
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:08,315
Scott: I wouldn't say it's like the greatest game in the world But it's a two-player game, which is rare, right?

590
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:09,320
Rym: You can just rip it out.

591
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:10,671
Scott: It's got a lot of replay value.

592
00:35:10,712 --> 00:35:11,720
Scott: You can play it very quickly.

593
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,520
Scott: I mean if you play it with people who know the rules, it's as quick as a round of fighting.

594
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:22,791
Scott: You know of Street Fighter, which is pretty great You know, the only things is that it is no fooling.

595
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:28,220
Rym: pretty much rock paper scissors plus randomness determines Which of course, I mean Scott and I played two rounds earlier.

596
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,560
Rym: I barely won the second one and I Scott got a flawless victory on the first one.

597
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,253
Rym: I literally lost every paper rock scissor the whole time.

598
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,216
Rym: I do dodge.

599
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:39,988
Rym: He does throw I do attack He does block like it was just perfect.

600
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:40,490
Rym: Perfect.

601
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:41,073
Rym: Perfect.

602
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:42,419
Rym: There was nothing I could do.

603
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:45,755
Scott: Yeah, if you lose the right paper scissors every time you lose.

604
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:48,727
Scott: that's just how it goes Right and that may you know.

605
00:35:48,787 --> 00:35:54,285
Scott: and the thing is that's what fighting games are at the highest level is rock paper scissors With some randomness, right?

606
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:58,980
Rym: Well all games break down to either arbitrary random or solvable.

607
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,447
Scott: I mean, there's no solvable because you're against a human opponent.

608
00:36:01,468 --> 00:36:02,210
Scott: What are you gonna solve?

609
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,410
Scott: Right?

610
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:02,671
Scott: You don't.

611
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:03,634
Scott: he could push any button.

612
00:36:03,654 --> 00:36:07,385
Rym: Ah, I Play tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.

613
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:09,191
Scott: No, no, but I mean there's.

614
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:17,438
Scott: there's so many possible attacks that it's not a solvable thing Right, yeah in a fighting game now unless you you you're trying to defend it could be a broken fighting game.

615
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:21,880
Scott: where it's like Aha, this unblockable combo over and over again will win and that's a solution.

616
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:23,900
Rym: That's basically why Kenshiro wins every fight.

617
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:32,169
Scott: Yeah But but non-broken one attack that in non broken fighting games when you've mastered the execution it comes down to rock paper scissors Plus a little bit of randomness.

618
00:36:32,632 --> 00:36:33,739
Scott: All right, and that's what Yomi is.

619
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,531
Rym: Yeah, well or you know Bushido blade came down to.

620
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:38,640
Rym: I know how to do the throw and no one else does.

621
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:41,453
Scott: Yeah, but think about it.

622
00:36:41,514 --> 00:36:47,560
Scott: It's like okay I'm by sitting your guile and we're playing Street Fighter where we're both masters, right?

623
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:55,540
Scott: So I'm gonna go and try to do this attack You know and people always talk about like you try to trick the other guy into doing a move to leave himself open.

624
00:36:55,942 --> 00:36:56,909
Scott: You know, that's that's all.

625
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:58,520
Scott: that's exactly what it's all about in Yomi.

626
00:36:58,762 --> 00:37:06,360
Rym: It's like the old samurai fights where you know I will open myself up to let him hit me knowing that he will hit me on mortally, but I will hit him mortally.

627
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,268
Scott: Yeah, I sort of like this idea though.

628
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:11,280
Scott: I wish that it would expand to more areas, right?

629
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,200
Scott: Like maybe what we should do is go in both directions, right?

630
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,092
Rym: You know wait, so we take an RTS and make it turn based.

631
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:19,868
Scott: No like a turn It's not what I'm talking about.

632
00:37:19,928 --> 00:37:20,109
Scott: Right?

633
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,660
Scott: So in Street Fighter, right?

634
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:29,544
Scott: they took out the execution component so that people who couldn't execute could learn and appreciate the Strategic component.

635
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:35,744
Scott: and maybe some of those people will go back and play fighting games and maybe some fighting game people will play Yomi And it'll cross over right?

636
00:37:36,206 --> 00:37:46,799
Scott: Maybe what we need to do is take some other games, you know and remove a component that people can't get past right and cross them over for those games that skill right.

637
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,932
Scott: or We can do is we can take games Scott.

638
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,663
Rym: They did that her first-person shooters They made Halo.

639
00:37:52,683 --> 00:38:02,960
Scott: All right, but I'm talking about we can take say Puerto Rico add an execution component You know and keep the same strategy as Puerto Rico, but at execution make it a video game.

640
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,948
Scott: You've got a crocodile your brown guys into the plantations exact something, you know something along those lines You know.

641
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:11,140
Scott: you take this, you know.

642
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:19,182
Scott: Take a game that has a strategy and an execution remove one or the other take a game that only has one add the other You know.

643
00:38:19,203 --> 00:38:28,496
Scott: try to get crossover because I feel like this is how even though these these two different games will have the same strategy Or same execution component at least no crossover between the community

644
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:32,054
Rym: when I imagine board games Like I'm playing Puerto Rico a whole bunch and I think about man.

645
00:38:32,094 --> 00:38:33,100
Rym: What kind of game do I want?

646
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:46,151
Rym: It's always take Puerto Rico and add one additional component or remove one fundamental component Or replace one component and it's basically that yeah I mean you look, you know, some people are sort of doing it.

647
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:50,114
Scott: Like you look at Le Havre is pretty much Calus plus Agricola.

648
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:53,747
Scott: Yeah Mine is as much in the inside is a theme.

649
00:38:53,807 --> 00:38:59,416
Rym: the theme of Le Havre is basically boats get victory point pictures of boats get points.

650
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:02,161
Rym: how Abstractions.

651
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:03,807
Scott: at least Calus has a real theme.

652
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:05,713
Rym: Yeah put stuff in the castle.

653
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:07,740
Scott: I played a game of Calus board game.

654
00:39:07,881 --> 00:39:09,447
Rym: Oh my god, I want to play Calus again.

655
00:39:09,488 --> 00:39:14,302
Rym: real bad crushed it because you went into the castle Castle.

656
00:39:14,322 --> 00:39:20,000
Scott: this other guy did all gold and he was using second place But but he didn't castle at all.

657
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:28,820
Scott: So yeah, I lost a bunch of points and this other guy was way behind like dead last But he caught up to second place in the last in the final round, but I won the dungeon and the walls.

658
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:32,420
Scott: He won the tower and I still did pretty good in the towers and no one can catch.

659
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,387
Rym: You know kids if you'd gone to our how to win a games panel We told you all how to win Calus.

660
00:39:36,568 --> 00:39:37,352
Scott: direct path to big.

661
00:39:37,392 --> 00:39:38,658
Rym: just go to the castle correct.

662
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:44,530
Scott: bad favors favors favors Bottom bottom favor track to get free buildings.

663
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,895
Scott: Yeah, I built a blue building.

664
00:39:45,936 --> 00:39:47,060
Scott: No one else built a blue building.

665
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,443
Scott: I won.

666
00:39:47,604 --> 00:39:49,095
Rym: Yep buildings and victory points.

667
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,626
Scott: Yep No one can stop me.

668
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:51,947
Scott: All right.

669
00:39:52,048 --> 00:39:53,053
Rym: But yeah, yo me is fun.

670
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:54,400
Scott: I even made a mistake.

671
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,875
Scott: I probably could have had two blue buildings because I forgot the gold mine existed and I didn't.

672
00:39:58,935 --> 00:40:01,308
Scott: I could have chosen the green building Favor one more time.

673
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:05,411
Rym: Nah, but anyway God I really want to play Calus now.

674
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:06,657
Rym: Yes, like real bad.

675
00:40:06,677 --> 00:40:07,139
Scott: Let's do it.

676
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:11,151
Scott: Anyway, so yo me yo me is the new hotness.

677
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:13,600
Scott: Everyone's talking about it and not with no reason.

678
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,327
Scott: I mean, it's not the greatest but it's good.

679
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:18,640
Rym: I posit because we've had a worth your worth your money.

680
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:18,961
Scott: We have

681
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:26,183
Rym: had a renaissance like a study really a renaissance but a surge of this kind of game lately in our crew at Conventions 10

682
00:40:26,183 --> 00:40:27,407
Scott: billion times better than munchkin

683
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:33,708
Rym: because there are two times when we need a game that we can whip out Relatively quickly without a lot of fuss and mess.

684
00:40:33,728 --> 00:40:44,279
Rym: that can be taught easily and played to completion before the line moves standing in line for something or Warming up while we're waiting for everyone to finish their business to play a real game?

685
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,786
Rym: Yeah, and spot it.

686
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:49,180
Rym: jungle speed and yo me are like the three best games for the M banana grams.

687
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:55,880
Scott: Yeah the problem I keep having though is that People play these games and then these games dominate like people just sit there playing spot it for an hour.

688
00:40:55,942 --> 00:41:01,810
Scott: It's like no You're supposed to spot it for like a minute while someone sets up the cube game And once the cube game is set up stop playing spots.

689
00:41:01,851 --> 00:41:03,720
Rym: the fundamental problem of the cube game.

690
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,759
Rym: We got to play the cube game up in that hallway above the expo hall instead of down in the bottom of the expo.

691
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,262
Rym: Haha.

692
00:41:10,483 --> 00:41:10,825
Scott: Yeah.

693
00:41:11,328 --> 00:41:11,670
Scott: Yeah.

694
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:21,720
Rym: Anyway with Rainbow Dash This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
