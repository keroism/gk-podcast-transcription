1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,910
Rym: It's Monday December 5th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,351
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:13,153
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:15,159
Rym: And this is Dinosaur Knights.

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,503
Rym: Tonight we talk about the Alhambra.

6
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:21,249
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:29,785
Rym: I point out that the Alhambra was completely walled if you had an optimal score.

8
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:32,552
Rym: Sure.

9
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:35,420
Scott: That's one badass Alhambra right there.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,785
Rym: We're talking about walled gardens.

11
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:38,170
Rym: I made an inside joke.

12
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:38,853
Scott: Thanks.

13
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,158
Scott: It wasn't inside.

14
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:40,700
Rym: It was inside.

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,668
Rym: It's Monday so we have some non-gamers here.

16
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:49,317
Rym: Speaking of games, this has happened to me enough times to where it's a problem now and I'm not sure what to do about it.

17
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:50,140
Rym: So Amazon, right?

18
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:55,460
Rym: You can buy stuff from Amazon or you can buy stuff through Amazon from other people.

19
00:00:56,341 --> 00:01:00,960
Rym: The majority of board game tabletop game stuff that's on Amazon is through these other people.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,722
Rym: That's just the way it is.

21
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:09,244
Rym: Three of my last four orders for board game stuff were through Amazon to some reseller.

22
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:15,809
Rym: All three of these orders were canceled by the person within a few days of me paying them money.

23
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:16,815
Scott: Yeah, do you know why this works?

24
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:18,162
Rym: I know exactly what happens.

25
00:01:18,223 --> 00:01:27,968
Rym: These people list things they don't have and then they try to go buy them on the open market and discover that they in fact cannot buy it for a reasonable price compared to what I paid them for it.

26
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,496
Scott: That's not quite exactly what it is.

27
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:36,164
Scott: What it is is that they have computer programs set up and they select products and they automatically program this thing.

28
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:46,722
Scott: It's basically an automatic system that manages Amazon listings on its own and you tell it like, "Hey, you know, you find a website that's selling something that's not

29
00:01:46,822 --> 00:01:47,224
Scott: Amazon.".

30
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,735
Scott: Let's say you go to, I don't know, Funagain.

31
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:50,740
Rym: I can summarize this.

32
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,503
Rym: They're trying, they're attempting ham-fistedly to perform arbitrage on the open internet market of stuff.

33
00:01:56,805 --> 00:02:00,180
Scott: Yeah, you go to funagain.com and it says here, "Tickets arrived, Asia,

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,361
Scott: $18.".

35
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:08,225
Scott: I go to Amazon and I set the system to look at that page and meanwhile it manages an Amazon page that says, "Ticket to ride, Asia,

36
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:08,265
Scott: $19.".

37
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:14,584
Scott: When I find out that they're all sold out on Funagain.

38
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:15,829
Rym: I have two points though.

39
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:23,376
Rym: One, most of the people I've done business with where I ran into this problem do not seem terribly sophisticated.

40
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:30,945
Rym: I wonder if they're buying a package like a consultant sets this up for them or if they're doing it manually and just kind of trying to wing it.

41
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:44,153
Rym: But all that aside, I feel like Amazon should do something about this because it's a pain in the ass and I think the people who do this should be punished to prevent them or at least discourage them from doing such things.

42
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:50,679
Rym: For example, say you cancel more than, I don't know, 5% of your orders in a month's span.

43
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:51,844
Rym: You should be kicked off Amazon.

44
00:02:52,667 --> 00:03:00,437
Scott: I think that what they should do is they should, it's real simple, is don't order things from someone unless it's obvious that they have it.

45
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:11,920
Scott: Like if it says, for example, once I bought something that was like a framed, a picture frame without anything in it and it was sold by Frames R Us or something along those lines which tells me, yeah, they've got the fucking frame.

46
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,980
Rym: Yeah, but I ordered this from a game store straight up.

47
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,411
Scott: Oh really?

48
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:15,760
Scott: Wow.

49
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,709
Rym: In fact, all of these, this is why I bring it up.

50
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:23,942
Rym: Every one of these failed orders was from a game reseller and if you look on their listing, they list a ton of games, one of each.

51
00:03:24,123 --> 00:03:26,039
Rym: I suspect they don't have any of those games.

52
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:33,190
Scott: Yeah, that's a new one because usually when it's one of those generic sellers, it's like discount goodies or something along those lines.

53
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:36,003
Scott: It's a generic store name that could sell anything.

54
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:48,713
Scott: Or only buy things that are fulfilled by Amazon which means that they are paying to store the thing in Amazon's warehouse and Amazon is tracking the merchandise and quantities in their system automatically.

55
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:52,339
Scott: So you know you're definitely going to get it because as soon as you order it, Amazon will send it to you.

56
00:03:52,601 --> 00:04:00,573
Rym: So even more worrisome is that I look on Amazon again and I see Jungle Speed for 20 bucks, says ship by Amazon, whatever.

57
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:01,299
Rym: So all right.

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,900
Scott: So that means it's in Amazon's warehouse.

59
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,285
Rym: That's what it says on the side.

60
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:19,879
Rym: But if I go to the email I got, it says, you know, your order from Robinson Game Store was canceled and there's a link to my order which links to that exact Amazon order page that I'm looking at right now.

61
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,159
Scott: It says ships from and sold by Amazon.com?

62
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:22,123
Rym: Yes.

63
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:26,800
Rym: So either Amazon doesn't actually say who's fulfilling these orders until the end.

64
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:28,360
Rym: There's some shenanigans.

65
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,629
Scott: There is a shenanigans.

66
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:30,760
Scott: I think you got to email Amazon.

67
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,480
Rym: The thing is this has happened for every tabletop thing I've ordered from Amazon in a while.

68
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:37,711
Rym: So I'm wondering, there's something going on.

69
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:39,420
Rym: I'm going to do some investigative journalism.

70
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:40,158
Scott: Yeah.

71
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,850
Rym: Because Amazon, seriously, don't fuck with me here.

72
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:45,280
Rym: I'm a D level internet celebrity.

73
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,220
Rym: I will bring the rage of tens of people to your doorstep.

74
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:53,699
Scott: Except pretty much Amazon owns me at this point.

75
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,402
Rym: Yeah, I know.

76
00:04:54,964 --> 00:04:55,487
Rym: I'm unable.

77
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,637
Rym: Did you see that article Fred Schott retweeted.

78
00:04:57,678 --> 00:05:01,577
Rym: that was like, turns out the majority of people in bookstores buy things on Amazon.

79
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,038
Rym: after looking at them in bookstores.

80
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,360
Scott: There's a big surprise.

81
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:07,546
Rym: So what do you got for me?

82
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:08,673
Rym: It's Monday.

83
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:09,940
Rym: Talking about tech, not gaming.

84
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,701
Scott: Yeah.

85
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:14,236
Scott: So you know how Mozilla, which is very important, right, makes all its money.

86
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:16,851
Scott: Eighty five percent of their monies come from Google.

87
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:18,721
Scott: People don't, most people don't know this, right.

88
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:24,783
Scott: And the way they get the money from Google is basically Google says, hey, Mozilla, we have a contract.

89
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:29,140
Scott: every time you send search traffic to Google through Firefox.

90
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:29,784
Scott: Right.

91
00:05:29,824 --> 00:05:31,960
Scott: Because Google is all up in Firefox.

92
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:32,303
Scott: Right.

93
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:33,520
Scott: Is the default search engine.

94
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:34,544
Scott: It's the.

95
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:40,780
Scott: if you just type something in the Firefox location bar and automatically Google, I'm feeling lucky, you know, it does all this stuff with Google.

96
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:50,420
Scott: So all the search traffic that gets sent to Google from Firefox, that is, you know, Mozilla gets some of the monies from those ads that are on those pages.

97
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:53,019
Scott: And that is where Mozilla gets almost all its monies.

98
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:57,020
Scott: And without that monies, Mozilla is in big trouble and Firefox is in big trouble.

99
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:00,620
Scott: So that contract is about to end.

100
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:05,340
Scott: It was a three year deal and they are negotiating to renew the deal.

101
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:10,793
Scott: So, you know, it might be renewed and everything will be cool and we won't lose Mozilla's.

102
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:11,159
Scott: But.

103
00:06:13,882 --> 00:06:19,380
Scott: If, you know, something goes wrong, bad news could happen.

104
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:23,460
Scott: Very bad news, real bad.

105
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:25,418
Scott: That's pretty much it.

106
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,421
Rym: All right.

107
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:34,980
Rym: So there's a story on Slashdot and I'll link to the NPR one because there's no more information than what you already will see in these linked articles.

108
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,980
Rym: Like there hasn't been much, I guess, journalism beyond the basic story.

109
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,743
Rym: But the basic story is that in Mexico, there is a very bad gang, if you're unaware, the Zetas.

110
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:50,480
Rym: These are like the violent drug running paramilitary freaks down there who are murdering people using things like Facebook.

111
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
Rym: And then it'll come after me anyway.

112
00:06:53,420 --> 00:07:00,920
Rym: So aside from the fact that it's interesting that on Slashdot, there is literally no discussion about the article from a technological side.

113
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,780
Rym: It's only either discussion of the drug war or prohibition.

114
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:04,503
Scott: Great.

115
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:08,280
Rym: Or Mexico, like politics in general, but nothing about the technology thing.

116
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:21,279
Rym: The technology thing is that a part, according to the DOD, Mexican Army found and dismantled a gigantic telecommunications network that Los Zetas had set up in Mexico for their private secret communications.

117
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:29,100
Rym: Fourteen hundred radios, twenty six hundred cell phones, one hundred and sixty seven antennas and one hundred and sixty six power supplies.

118
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:30,282
Scott: OK.

119
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,240
Rym: So I guess one of the antennas was on power.

120
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,105
Rym: Maybe it was a backup.

121
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:35,259
Rym: Maybe someone stole the power supply.

122
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:44,184
Rym: But it just goes to show that if you are evil and you want to get away with stuff, it's not that you have money.

123
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:47,680
Rym: It's not that hard to set up basically your own infrastructure.

124
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:48,825
Scott: Well, but think about it.

125
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:49,026
Scott: Right.

126
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:52,396
Scott: They were they were mostly setting up a walkie talkie cell phone network.

127
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:52,600
Scott: Right.

128
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,794
Scott: Probably voice com.

129
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:54,180
Scott: Right.

130
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:56,799
Scott: And it was probably really low traffic because it's just them.

131
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,491
Scott: It's not like we're trying to replace the.

132
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,740
Scott: you know, to replace the Internet.

133
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,900
Rym: You need tons and tons and tons of serious equipment.

134
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,720
Rym: You don't replace the Internet because here's the other thing.

135
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,163
Rym: If you're doing a relatively geographically defined thing, you have orders going out in different ways.

136
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:12,039
Rym: But then like the last mile use technology like this.

137
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,527
Rym: I'm pretty confident that even in the

138
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:15,029
Rym: U.S.,

139
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,880
Rym: a small network like this turned up and used for very specific purposes would basically be uncatchable before it was too late.

140
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,460
Scott: The problem is if you do it in any highly populated area.

141
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:25,164
Scott: Right.

142
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:25,908
Scott: You got a lot.

143
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,640
Scott: The spectrum is hard to get.

144
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:29,008
Scott: You know, it's like that.

145
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:30,780
Scott: I'm obviously not going to get the spectrum legally.

146
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,604
Scott: You're pirate radio.

147
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:35,400
Scott: True, but you're just so much interference with the spectrum.

148
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,500
Scott: And then the FCC will find you very quickly.

149
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,700
Scott: You have to do it basically in the in the sticks in the middle of nowhere.

150
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:43,259
Scott: And then maybe it'll take them a while to find you if they even notice you.

151
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:44,807
Rym: I think it's more interesting.

152
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,943
Scott: What effect can you have on this from the perspective of IT?

153
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:53,780
Rym: Because I always wondered when I was a kid, like who does IT for the mob and who does IT for like the Yakuza?

154
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,460
Rym: And I wonder I wonder who ends up with those jobs.

155
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:04,360
Rym: And I would love, really love to even anonymously interview like the guy who does the computer support for like the mob boss.

156
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,400
Rym: I just think that'd be a really neat thing to look into.

157
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,540
Scott: He probably just calls up like the Geek Squad from Best Buy.

158
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,893
Scott: He probably doesn't have IT.

159
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:13,020
Scott: And they don't know he's a mob boss.

160
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,280
Scott: He's just some guy with a big fancy house and who needs his computer fixed.

161
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,480
Rym: Guys like, yeah, this people I'm going to kill dot CSV.

162
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:22,198
Rym: You couldn't import it because you were trying to import it as an XLS.

163
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:33,466
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, party frog.

164
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,984
Scott: This was pretty funny.

165
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,209
Rym: I just I like the way the party frog dances.

166
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:41,119
Rym: That's it.

167
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:41,690
Rym: You'll see.

168
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,388
Rym: It's party frog.

169
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:43,074
Scott: Check this out.

170
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:45,330
Scott: You ever gone to 8bitweapon.com with the number eight?

171
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:46,149
Rym: I have not.

172
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,490
Scott: I haven't either until recently.

173
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,430
Scott: So what they got is mostly I'm concerned with their store, right?

174
00:09:50,470 --> 00:10:02,329
Scott: In their store, they sell some T-shirts and they sell some CDs of Chiptune music and their CDs are in these cool CD sleeves that look like five and a quarter floppies with little sleeves on them and then the CDs inside of there.

175
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:05,850
Scott: But the most important thing they sell is two different software products.

176
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,790
Scott: The Apple to DMS drummer and the Apple to DMS music.

177
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:11,555
Scott: I have an Apple to.

178
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:21,809
Scott: I feel like I should buy these Apple to Chiptune software that exists because I have an Apple to and that'd be kind of awesome to make it do something useful instead of sit in the closet.

179
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:23,626
Rym: So I'm going to actually do it.

180
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:25,249
Scott: It's 15 bucks.

181
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,053
Scott: I mean, maybe.

182
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:32,730
Rym: So anyway, the meta moment, which hopefully be pretty quickly book club book is two books, two books, two books.

183
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:42,337
Scott: You need to read Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Ejouperi, which I'm still keep saying his name because I'm waiting for a French person to correct me or confirm that I think you're doing OK.

184
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:45,130
Scott: And that book will take you about like a minute to read.

185
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:55,949
Scott: And number two, you need to do to read Wind, Sand and Stars, also by the same person, which is a book that will take you more than an hour.

186
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:56,971
Rym: Yep.

187
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:09,189
Rym: Also, very important, if you are fans of us and you don't go to our website or read the forum at all, you should at least go to our website once or twice, because we've actually got a lot of stuff going on that isn't actually an audio form.

188
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:22,310
Rym: For example, all our lectures from PAX East last year online in their entirety, as is a good chunk of our lecture from PAX Prime this year and a bunch of other videos from conventions and our other show, Radio Free Equestria.

189
00:11:23,592 --> 00:11:28,375
Scott: And it's all on YouTube and also Twitter, Facebook and all the other places on the Internet.

190
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:28,577
Rym: Yep.

191
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,749
Rym: G+ we have a G+ thingy.

192
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,329
Rym: You can go and do your G+ thingies there if you have G+ thingies to do.

193
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:36,608
Rym: Our forum is an ivory tower up and above the rest.

194
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,548
Rym: I'm going to be straight with you.

195
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,769
Rym: If you can't write grammatically correctly, don't even bother trying to get into our forum because you'll get banned like that.

196
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,250
Rym: We are going to Magfest.

197
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:53,810
Rym: If you want a Bolt Bus ticket, they just went on sale, they're going to sell out, probably.

198
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,770
Scott: From New York for Thursday morning, at least.

199
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,450
Rym: Yeah, but if you don't live in New York.

200
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:03,770
Rym: We're going to be doing Beyond Dungeons and Dragons, second edition.

201
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,810
Rym: We're also going to be on two...

202
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,094
Scott: Why don't we do Advanced Beyond Dungeons and Dragons, not Beyond Advanced, Advance Beyond.

203
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:11,330
Rym: We're also going to be on two discussion panels.

204
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,575
Rym: One of them will have Dr.

205
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:14,790
Rym: Hazard to re-mus a new intellectual asshole.

206
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:18,090
Rym: So we'll be talking about money-making in games, and I forget what the other one is.

207
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,010
Rym: I can look into the details.

208
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,030
Rym: We will be at the Penny Arcade Expo East doing 2B announced panels.

209
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,870
Rym: We will be at Anime Boston doing 2B announced panels.

210
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:34,489
Rym: We will be this week, Thursday, December 8th, in New York City at Nerd Night NYC, which is in Dumbo.

211
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:38,868
Rym: If you don't know what Dumbo is, then you probably don't live close enough to go to this.

212
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,289
Scott: It costs money to go to it.

213
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:41,959
Rym: It's $14 to get in at 7PM.

214
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:48,348
Rym: To see us, but maybe you want to do nerd trivia, which not my bag, but some other people's bag.

215
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:54,590
Scott: The other two people talking are, let's see, Back to the Lectures at Hand, Cephalopods, Nature's Adorable, Amazing Abominations.

216
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,990
Scott: That could be maybe good.

217
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:56,273
Scott: Yeah.

218
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:57,609
Scott: And after and then us.

219
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:01,610
Scott: And then after us, The Language of OkCupid by Bentley McBentleson.

220
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,474
Rym: So we'll see.

221
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:04,370
Rym: These are like flash lectures.

222
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,270
Rym: Twenty one minutes is the max we get.

223
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:10,070
Rym: For the lectures, doors open at $8.15, and that's only 10 bucks.

224
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:17,169
Rym: I'm not going to tell you to go because it's one thing, you know, you pay for a badge to PAX to see us, but it and also to get PAX.

225
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:24,509
Rym: So if Cephalopods, Adorable, Amazing Abominations and OkCupid and us seems worth 10 bucks, then go.

226
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,709
Rym: If it doesn't seem worth it, don't go.

227
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:28,415
Rym: I don't know.

228
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:29,749
Rym: I can tell you it should be fun.

229
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,070
Scott: It says on the website, losing should be fun.

230
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,030
Scott: Buy Rym to Koster.

231
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,930
Scott: But then in the bio, it says Rym and Scott.

232
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:37,109
Rym: Yeah, I wrote the bio.

233
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:38,508
Scott: OK, yeah.

234
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,529
Rym: Rym and Scott host GeekNights when they're not blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

235
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:43,816
Rym: Sure.

236
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:44,570
Rym: It should be fun.

237
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,450
Rym: We haven't done a lot of local NYC sort of stuff, but it's pretty easy to do it.

238
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,827
Rym: So I started putting feelers out and we'll probably be doing more things like this in the coming future.

239
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,794
Scott: Brilliant.

240
00:13:56,055 --> 00:14:00,553
Rym: Also, keep ConnectiCon in your hearts because it won't be that long before panel submissions go up.

241
00:14:01,477 --> 00:14:03,385
Rym: And there's more announcements about ConnectiCon.

242
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,976
Rym: I shouldn't say yet, but they're coming.

243
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:06,110
Rym: They're coming.

244
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:15,290
Rym: So the walled garden, remember a long time ago before you had access to the Internet, you had access to a thing that was like the Internet.

245
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,449
Rym: Remember Prodigy, AOL, all those things?

246
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,884
Scott: Yeah, I had AOLs, but I had AOLs like in the 56K, well, 14.4 modem days.

247
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:32,175
Scott: I had a friend who had Prodigy on an IBM PS1, my first online experience, like maybe 2800 baud.

248
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:33,230
Scott: It was a weak ass modem.

249
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,134
Scott: Was with Prodigy.

250
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:39,436
Rym: And then I went to Prodigy Internet and I was on WOW for a while, but those were walled gardens.

251
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:43,529
Rym: And there is an era where, you know, other than super nerds, no one had access to the Internet.

252
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,873
Scott: Well, people in case people who aren't technological haven't heard the walled garden metaphor.

253
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:51,470
Scott: Basically, it's one of those metaphors that's so perfect that it sort of just become the terminology.

254
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:51,992
Scott: Right.

255
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:55,550
Scott: So a walled garden is any sort of computing environment.

256
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,111
Scott: Right.

257
00:14:56,372 --> 00:15:05,470
Scott: That is cultivated and everything is beautiful and amazing and it's so great to be inside, but nothing goes in and nothing goes out.

258
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:08,430
Scott: So if you want to see the beautiful flowers, you have to come inside.

259
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,549
Scott: And if you want to take the beautiful flowers and show them to someone outside, you can't.

260
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,450
Scott: And, you know, AOL is a perfect example.

261
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,089
Scott: If you ever used AOL back in the day, right, that you could go on the Web with an AOL.

262
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,089
Scott: There was like IE was built into it.

263
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:24,450
Scott: But in AOL, there were keywords.

264
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,650
Scott: So you could go to AOL keyword something something.

265
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:30,889
Scott: And the only way to go to AOL keyword something something is if you were on AOL.

266
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,829
Scott: So people who didn't have AOL couldn't see anything that was posted in AOL.

267
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:44,249
Scott: And likewise, you couldn't say take a link to or some content out of an you know, that you saw on an AOL keyword page and share it outside of AOL.

268
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,470
Scott: It was a walled garden.

269
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,850
Scott: All these beautiful keyword interface thingies in AOL were only in AOL.

270
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:53,190
Scott: And there was no connection between that and the rest of the world.

271
00:15:53,551 --> 00:16:01,490
Rym: Now, it's funny how some people you know, it's almost like the Berlin Wall fell and most people saw the outside and were like, oh, my God, there's an Internet.

272
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:10,770
Rym: History is nothing but Berlin Wall's falling repeatedly, but at the same time, much like if you take a chicken from a factory farm and put it free, it just kind of stands there.

273
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,350
Rym: How many of your grandparents and parents use the AOL icon?

274
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:17,494
Rym: And that's the Internet.

275
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:22,494
Rym: because they don't even know they they they don't realize that anything changed.

276
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:36,370
Rym: Now, the walled garden kind of had a resurgence after the Berlin Wall fell when Apple started releasing things through app stores, which I guess, according to all of Apple's lawsuits, is a shortcut for Apple and not application.

277
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:40,130
Rym: Yeah, but the metaphor still applies.

278
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:49,693
Rym: You've got this idea that you've got a locked platform and as a result, there's a curated collection of programs that run on this platform, which has a lot of pros and a lot of cons.

279
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,570
Rym: We're not getting into ideology yet.

280
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,395
Rym: We'll get to that.

281
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,550
Rym: But I mean, think about the cons.

282
00:16:54,995 --> 00:16:56,309
Rym: I can install whatever I want.

283
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:00,370
Rym: Pro, I can't install broken bullshit that breaks my shit.

284
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:01,510
Scott: Yup.

285
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:04,130
Rym: Cons, I can't install anything.

286
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:19,990
Rym: So the problem here is that Apple made the idea of the software walled garden, the app store, extremely palatable to the average person, because it is really great from the user experience perspective in most cases.

287
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,650
Rym: I mean, you're not going to get spyware on your iPhone.

288
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:30,989
Rym: Meanwhile, pretty much everyone I know over the age of 40 who is not a technologist has spyware on their PC, whether they know it or not.

289
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,970
Rym: In fact, most of the people I know who are under 40 have spyware on their PCs.

290
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,470
Rym: We were just at Scott Johnson's party and we identified lots of malware that appeared to be on that PC he had in the basement.

291
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:49,249
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's just like, you know, every time the walled garden comes along, it's eventually destroyed and then another one comes up.

292
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:55,035
Scott: And it's weird because even though they're continually destroyed every time they appear, I don't think they are.

293
00:17:55,055 --> 00:17:57,770
Scott: They're also continuously successful.

294
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,450
Scott: It's like AOL was wildly successful and then it failed.

295
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:02,930
Scott: And then the app store is wildly successful.

296
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,813
Scott: It's going to fail.

297
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,562
Rym: There's a big difference between those two.

298
00:18:05,904 --> 00:18:06,547
Rym: back in the AOL days.

299
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:11,753
Rym: It was I mean, even I was into computers and I couldn't figure out how to get connected to the Internet.

300
00:18:12,577 --> 00:18:14,870
Rym: So I got prodigy because I couldn't figure out anything else.

301
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,449
Rym: And I didn't know there was an Internet that was different from that.

302
00:18:18,551 --> 00:18:20,630
Rym: And people, you know, were in the same boat.

303
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,130
Rym: But then when there were generic ISPs, people were kind of freed from these shackles.

304
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:31,890
Rym: There was the walled garden was an alternative to something that wasn't accessible to most people, which is the only reason they went to those walled gardens in the first place.

305
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:37,592
Rym: How many people outside of China willingly put themselves into an Internet walled garden today?

306
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:41,370
Rym: I mean, high schools force it on people.

307
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,353
Rym: Some bullshit.

308
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:47,602
Rym: colleges forces on students, by the way, never go to a college that restricts the way you use the Internet in any way.

309
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:48,308
Rym: No kidding.

310
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,776
Rym: It's not worth it.

311
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,870
Rym: RIT can do whatever you wanted on Internet.

312
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:57,312
Scott: You even had your own real real world static IP address, not like a static IP in the school.

313
00:18:57,756 --> 00:18:59,670
Scott: on a on a on a land behind a net.

314
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,090
Rym: I missed that variable cornucopia of pirated goods.

315
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:05,003
Rym: I miss those days.

316
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:05,629
Scott: Oh, yeah.

317
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:07,689
Rym: It's basically our private piracy network.

318
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:14,993
Rym: But so now we've got this opposite situation where there are people who say, I can't deal with the freedom.

319
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:22,730
Rym: I choose to lock myself into this walled garden in hopes that the people who control the locks will let me out if I really need to get out.

320
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,654
Scott: Well, you know, it's people who don't go into a walled garden, right, unless it's beautiful to begin with.

321
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:27,775
Scott: Right.

322
00:19:27,795 --> 00:19:29,870
Scott: There's a lot of walled gardens out there that are just ugly.

323
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,130
Scott: So you walk in and you're like, oh, this place is all shit.

324
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,176
Scott: And they just leave immediately.

325
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:36,396
Rym: I mean, probably for people to go in basically like North Korea.

326
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,770
Rym: I was in this like horrible dingy place.

327
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,010
Rym: And then I looked out a window and I was like, oh, shit, there's pasture out there.

328
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,833
Rym: And I escaped.

329
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:49,750
Scott: But yeah, it's like, you know, so when you see a walled garden that's popular, that's because it has something in it that the rest of the world does not have.

330
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,059
Scott: There's some beautiful flower growing within.

331
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,130
Scott: that is so awesome that people are going to go in there and stay in there and love that flower so much.

332
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,930
Scott: You stay in that shit and be like, oh, this is the greatest.

333
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,333
Scott: Yeah.

334
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:01,690
Scott: You know, this flower doesn't exist outside of this garden.

335
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:02,393
Rym: And that's true.

336
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:06,956
Rym: Look at the iPhone that an interface that good doesn't exist outside of that garden.

337
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,950
Scott: Not on phones anyway.

338
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:17,370
Rym: Yeah, well, but just talk about phones first, because my the line where I think this is a problem is a problem is not phones, because phones as they currently stand.

339
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:24,349
Rym: I mean, there are people who buy a feature restricted or limited or weak ass phone by choice anyway in this day and age.

340
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:31,950
Rym: So I don't care if someone uses a walled garden on a device like that, because I feel like I could argue that the benefits outweigh the cons.

341
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,394
Rym: Everyone I know who has tried to hack their phone or has like rooted their iPhone to do something ends up breaking it.

342
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:42,890
Rym: And very few of them have done it for any benefit that I can fathom being worthwhile.

343
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:43,392
Rym: Right.

344
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:46,670
Scott: I mean, there are some benefits and there's a few little things that people do that.

345
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,419
Scott: I'm like, oh, that's neat.

346
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,169
Scott: I wish I could do that.

347
00:20:48,250 --> 00:21:01,072
Scott: Like, you know, get an animated wallpaper on an iPhone, which doesn't have an animated wallpaper or more heavily customized ringtones and things of that nature, more so than you're allowed to normally change icons on things that you're normally not change icons for.

348
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:05,230
Scott: And, you know, they're just a lot of things, but it's not worth the effort.

349
00:21:05,592 --> 00:21:07,910
Scott: It's not worth your phone fucking breaking.

350
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,071
Scott: All right.

351
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:11,729
Scott: It's like it's, you know, it would be nice if I could just have it.

352
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,200
Scott: Yeah, but it's not worth, you know, but

353
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:25,649
Rym: it also very elegantly, as long as the curation process of the garden, you know, the gardener is good at what they do and is willing to actually make sure that no malware gets in, that shitty apps don't get in, that it is managed in some way.

354
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,834
Scott: That's another thing, right?

355
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:37,350
Scott: A walled garden is not only, you know, keeping things from leaving and keeping other, you know, keeping outside things from getting in, but it's defending from the outside.

356
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:38,132
Scott: Right.

357
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:56,691
Scott: It's like if you, you know, sometimes the world gets really dangerous and you just bombs falling from the sky and people taking analogies too far all over the place and you want to stay safe so you can hide in that walled garden while there are bombs dropping all over the motherfucker and wait until the war is over and then leave the walled garden.

358
00:21:56,772 --> 00:21:59,630
Scott: And especially, you know, if the walled gardens way beautiful.

359
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:03,170
Scott: Maybe that's a good idea sometimes, but it's never good.

360
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,669
Scott: It's never a good long term idea.

361
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:04,850
Rym: Yeah.

362
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:10,630
Rym: Well, at the same time, the Internet, if you think bombs falling is a bad metaphor, the Internet has always been the Wild West there.

363
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:23,669
Rym: You basically even if you're savvy, you cannot be safe from malware on the Internet unless you are not only savvy, but also kind of lucky and you don't care about anything that's pop culture related.

364
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:30,708
Rym: I mean, as long as you never search for like lyrics to songs, you're probably safe from like 15 percent of the malware out there.

365
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,331
Scott: Yeah.

366
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:34,430
Rym: But so what do we do?

367
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:45,350
Rym: There are people for whom they currently do just for whatever societal problems we won't get into about education and technology don't have the ability to protect themselves from all the people out there with guns in the Wild West, the Internet.

368
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:52,669
Rym: So living in the castle, the walled castle that Steve Jobs built is probably actually the best alternative for them.

369
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:55,670
Scott: Well, it is good for them and it's also bad for them.

370
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:55,911
Scott: Right.

371
00:22:55,952 --> 00:22:58,530
Scott: It's good for them and that it gets them something.

372
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:00,890
Scott: You know, as opposed to as opposed to just getting.

373
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,430
Rym: I mean, you're a peasant in the Middle Ages.

374
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:11,170
Rym: Your choices are die by bandit in the wilderness all alone and have all your stuff burned down or be a peasant shoveling shit around for some lord.

375
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:12,128
Rym: But you're not dead.

376
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:12,754
Scott: Right.

377
00:23:12,774 --> 00:23:13,590
Scott: It's Hokuto no Ken.

378
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:13,851
Scott: Right.

379
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:21,490
Scott: They could be a peasant and they could just get attacked by bandits all the time or they could stay in some sealed vault shelter where they're totally safe.

380
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,630
Scott: But, you know, it's not great living in a vault.

381
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,393
Scott: It kind of sucks.

382
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:28,129
Scott: Or but, you know, and living in that vault while they're safe.

383
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:29,750
Scott: And they have some food and shit.

384
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:36,353
Scott: So it's not the worst, but their potential to be the next Kenshiro is completely there's no chance.

385
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:39,450
Scott: At least if they were peasants, there's a chance for greatness.

386
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:45,770
Scott: Maybe they could be the ones who start the awesome town and, you know, are able to keep bandits at bay and have an awesome existence.

387
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,310
Scott: But you can't because you're in the walled garden.

388
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,630
Scott: You're stuck in the vault.

389
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,810
Rym: But anyway, let's hardware wise, cell phones are by and large fairly simple devices.

390
00:23:53,492 --> 00:24:06,430
Rym: And there's very little complex functionality I want from a smartphone that I can't already get either on an iPhone, despite the fact that it's pretty closed or in my droid, which has a curated walled garden, but also has a door.

391
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,930
Rym: I can walk right out that fucking garden, do whatever the hell I want.

392
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:09,454
Scott: Yep.

393
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:11,230
Rym: And I'm indifferent.

394
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,250
Rym: I don't care what people do and I don't think it's a problem.

395
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:24,353
Rym: And I'm actually kind of annoyed at the tech people who freak the fuck out that Apple is closed there, you know, not Monopoly phones, innards to people who aren't willing to go to extreme measures.

396
00:24:24,374 --> 00:24:28,645
Scott: I just don't care because the thing is their garden is not so completely sealed.

397
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:29,030
Scott: Right.

398
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:31,669
Scott: You know, the same way the AOL wasn't completely sealed.

399
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:41,109
Rym: I also don't care in that I don't care if, say, a toaster manufacturer documents the API for, you know, said confirming the firmware on the chip that toasts.

400
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:43,510
Scott: I would not mind if it was there.

401
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,709
Rym: I wouldn't mind if it was there.

402
00:24:45,132 --> 00:24:46,970
Rym: I'm not going to not buy it if it's not there.

403
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,870
Rym: And if I really care, I'll probably reverse engineer that shit anyway.

404
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,071
Scott: Yeah.

405
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:56,750
Scott: But, you know, there's there's a lot of situations where, you know, closedness is actually really awful.

406
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:02,210
Scott: So, Scott, you know, I don't want to say you are a maker in you and this and the software could have a bug, but it's closed source.

407
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,130
Scott: It's like I'm so I'm putting some mysterious thing in my body.

408
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:05,471
Scott: Great.

409
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:05,894
Scott: Yeah.

410
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:09,650
Rym: I feel like the closed source open source is a different argument, though, from the walled garden open garden.

411
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,670
Scott: Well, you know, but, you know, if your if your name is Richard Stallman.

412
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:12,934
Scott: Right.

413
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:13,666
Scott: There's no difference.

414
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:13,910
Scott: Right.

415
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:19,754
Scott: It's like even if this is software is, you know, open and usable and you can do whatever you want with it.

416
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:22,710
Scott: But the the source is closed.

417
00:25:23,011 --> 00:25:24,489
Scott: Well, and it's might as well it's, you know.

418
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:33,452
Rym: But if the garden has a crack, if there's a way to write my own software, then theoretically, no matter how bad the stuff is in the garden, I can write open stuff to do the things I need.

419
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:34,390
Scott: Well, but you know what?

420
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,400
Scott: You can't change the dirt.

421
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:36,330
Scott: Right.

422
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,648
Scott: If it's open source, you can change it.

423
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:43,333
Rym: But at this point, if the dirt is your problem, if you know it's fundamental core, the dirt is your problem.

424
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:46,973
Rym: Your only real reasonable option is to find some other dirt somewhere else.

425
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:47,479
Rym: And you know what?

426
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:48,590
Rym: It's called Android.

427
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,131
Scott: Yeah.

428
00:25:49,597 --> 00:25:50,710
Rym: And that dirt's not that bad.

429
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,089
Rym: And honestly, it's pretty bad.

430
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:58,235
Rym: The only everyone I know who complains about Android, their complaints are mostly pretty fucking baseless.

431
00:25:58,838 --> 00:26:01,070
Rym: They complain about things that they would like.

432
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:10,310
Rym: There are worse things on the iPhone that they don't complain about than like the tiny glitches that they run into on their heavily modded firmware hacked androids.

433
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:10,812
Scott: Yeah.

434
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:11,937
Scott: You can't complain about if you.

435
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:15,689
Scott: if you you know, it's like you can't complain on anything if you hacked it.

436
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:21,249
Rym: Also, half the problems I've heard people talk about Android are actually hardware problems because they brought a shitty handset.

437
00:26:22,793 --> 00:26:23,456
Rym: But I digress.

438
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:26,192
Rym: Here's I don't know about you, Scott, because I know you have rants about this.

439
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:27,450
Rym: We were arguing about this the other day.

440
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,509
Rym: But here's where I see a potential problem coming up.

441
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:39,610
Rym: It bothers me that this App Store model is moving to everything PCs that Apple computers and tablets now also have the App Store model.

442
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,110
Scott: Well, it's not just PCs, right?

443
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,616
Scott: It's even like sub.

444
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:44,946
Scott: it's like every thing has apps, right?

445
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,913
Scott: It's like, you know, and whether it's actually extensions or add ons or plugins, everyone's calling it apps.

446
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:56,112
Scott: So it's like Spotify is an app, but Spotify is also a platform that has apps.

447
00:26:56,373 --> 00:27:00,207
Scott: It's just like calling everything an app and any, you know, and every.

448
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:04,370
Scott: every single thing is being modularized, you know, into an app.

449
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:11,169
Scott: And it's like every single thing that is an app is also a platform for apps, which is also a platform for apps.

450
00:27:11,752 --> 00:27:16,520
Scott: And it's just like, you know, it's easy to think about if just the whole world, everything is an app.

451
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:17,229
Scott: Right.

452
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:28,630
Scott: And you put apps and apps and normal people can sort of get that idea as opposed to where before it would be like a piece of software on an OS and the piece of software has plugins, which has configurations and extensions.

453
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,109
Scott: Now it's just apps and apps and apps.

454
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:36,932
Rym: Now, this is a noble goal, but my worries that, well, in a way, you know, a little too far.

455
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:40,370
Rym: All right, Scott, if I take it way too far, I can make it a noble.

456
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,910
Scott: So I get the Spotify app for Windows eight and then the Spotify app has apps on it.

457
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:48,450
Scott: And then, you know, next thing you know, one of those apps got what's an app.

458
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:52,153
Rym: I mean, I got I got I'm running a program and oh, it's got a class in it that does something.

459
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:54,769
Scott: Well, no, it's like a separate you know, it's like a DLC.

460
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,509
Rym: All the classes in a different file.

461
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:58,790
Scott: It's a DLC, basically, right.

462
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:05,982
Scott: And it presents itself user interface ways and, you know, financial buy it ways and download it ways as an application.

463
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:07,290
Rym: that doesn't bother me that much.

464
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:07,993
Rym: Now, here's why.

465
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:17,310
Rym: In my current iteration, like the biggest app store to use the generic term to further generify it, to prevent Apple from getting their stupid trademark bullshit on it is steam.

466
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:25,330
Rym: When I want to buy a game, I go to steam, I type in the name of the game and it's probably there and I pay for it and I get it right there through steam.

467
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:29,931
Rym: Steam manages all the updates, all the add ons later DLC, everything is through this thing.

468
00:28:30,795 --> 00:28:37,885
Rym: But that walled garden is on my completely open garden, which is a Windows computer.

469
00:28:37,906 --> 00:28:39,352
Rym: I can do whatever the fuck I want with.

470
00:28:39,874 --> 00:28:46,130
Rym: My biggest fear is that if people get too used to apps, I'm not saying this will happen if they get too used to these walled gardens.

471
00:28:47,030 --> 00:29:03,109
Rym: The things that we saw coming down the pipe from CBDPA a long time ago will seem impalatable to people and there might be a push toward locked down, basically destroying the idea, not of the PC, because I don't care if I have a physical PC here or wherever, anywhere, if the PC dies or not.

472
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:08,273
Rym: I care about having an open platform, whatever it may reside on, to do whatever the hell I want with.

473
00:29:08,634 --> 00:29:15,090
Rym: The moment someone else can say you can't do X on that hardware, that is not, you know, that is general purpose.

474
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:19,350
Rym: We've lost a big battle when it comes to the future of technology.

475
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:20,234
Scott: Yeah, think about it.

476
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:27,050
Scott: It's like, OK, so the only apps you can install on your computer are ones that were approved by whoever.

477
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:27,553
Scott: Right.

478
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:30,470
Scott: OK, so on your phone, it doesn't really matter.

479
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:33,250
Scott: But what if it's on all computing devices?

480
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:34,749
Scott: Well, yeah, guess what?

481
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:36,149
Scott: You can't get any torrent clients.

482
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:37,570
Scott: You can't get IRC clients.

483
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:40,309
Scott: They don't install on modern computers and no one approves them.

484
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:48,190
Rym: Now, I envision a future where Apple computers by default only let you install approved apps through their app store and iTunes and whatever.

485
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:49,750
Rym: And maybe all Apple hardware.

486
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:56,590
Rym: Well, they were definitely going in that direction very slowly, which will be fine because Windows is still the majority desktop operating system.

487
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,249
Rym: And Windows isn't going down that road at all.

488
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:13,448
Rym: Even if they are no one, no user of Windows who actually matters, like corporate users, whatever, actually, at least in the near term, foreseeably let Windows lock it down to where they can install their proprietary bullshit, whatever it may be.

489
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:22,010
Rym: But what if in a far distant future, Apple becomes a majority or Microsoft gets dicked by some crazy legislation?

490
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,650
Scott: Apple's not going to become majority.

491
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:31,730
Rym: No, but what if they get such a majority of the desktop world that people stop making software that isn't business oriented for Windows?

492
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:35,150
Rym: I'm not saying it'll happen.

493
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,731
Rym: I'm not.

494
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:36,495
Scott: I think of anything.

495
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:37,280
Scott: I think of anything.

496
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,463
Scott: Apple will only care about consumers and is basically is moving away from the like.

497
00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:45,692
Scott: they don't even care about business or productivity or anything like that, which is good because they shouldn't compete over there.

498
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:47,110
Scott: They're just moving away from that.

499
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,215
Scott: Like they don't care.

500
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:54,770
Scott: They stop selling servers, you know, it's like they keep upgrading Xcode, but they really only want you to use Xcode to make software for Apple things.

501
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:57,550
Scott: And they want you to do, you know, office stuff.

502
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:05,570
Scott: I guess they have iWork and they want you to do media production, but they really just don't want you to do anything else with your Apple computer.

503
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:08,089
Scott: And they don't care about if it does anything else.

504
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:15,554
Scott: You know, it's like they'll sell you some games for your portable thingies, but they they're not selling you any games for OS X. They don't give a shit.

505
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:17,470
Rym: So I don't know.

506
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,434
Rym: I don't feel like it.

507
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:26,553
Rym: I guess the sum of this whole argument because this you know, this whole kind of meta argument and all these different levels is very important to people on the Internet right now.

508
00:31:26,613 --> 00:31:31,514
Rym: Yet I don't actually see an end game in the reasonable near future.

509
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:33,109
Rym: that actually is bad.

510
00:31:33,571 --> 00:31:35,290
Scott: I think you're just going to see history repeat.

511
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:35,731
Scott: Right.

512
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:43,450
Scott: Garden walls come up, then, you know, the people run inside the walls, garden walls come down, people come out, they go up, they go down.

513
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,508
Scott: It's over and over again.

514
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:47,770
Scott: Every bunch of years you'll see something go up and something come down.

515
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,370
Rym: But is there a pattern where cell phone is seen by many people?

516
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,590
Scott: It hasn't been going on long enough in technology to figure out what the pattern is.

517
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:55,952
Scott: All right.

518
00:31:55,972 --> 00:31:58,050
Scott: We've only seen the walls go up and down a couple of times.

519
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,270
Rym: Here's a possible pattern.

520
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,172
Rym: Cell phones.

521
00:32:00,534 --> 00:32:05,770
Rym: People see them as like appliances or purpose-built devices and they need them for specific things.

522
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,970
Rym: They need them to work reliably.

523
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:08,869
Rym: They don't need to customize them that much.

524
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:10,990
Rym: So they're cool with the walled garden there.

525
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:13,150
Rym: But they still have open computer platforms.

526
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:18,795
Rym: But what if that walled garden goes up, that little one, and no one ever leaves it because it's good enough?

527
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,869
Rym: Or at least the majority don't leave it.

528
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,090
Scott: The wall will come down eventually, always.

529
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:23,912
Rym: Will it?

530
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:26,310
Rym: What if, I mean, what are people going to be doing on their phones?

531
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,273
Rym: Oh, wait a minute.

532
00:32:28,358 --> 00:32:35,670
Rym: What about when we have enough bandwidth and peer to peer ad hoc wireless whatever to where I'm torrenting from my phone to Scott's phone?

533
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:36,641
Scott: Because as long as...

534
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:44,830
Rym: No, Scott, I'm saying when we get to that point, then suddenly the hackers are going to open all this stuff up or people are going to leave the walled garden to do the things that Apple doesn't want them to be doing.

535
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:51,930
Scott: The reason the walled garden comes down is because eventually, right, because it's shut off from the outside world, it doesn't pollinate and evolve.

536
00:32:52,672 --> 00:32:56,630
Scott: And eventually what happens is the outside world actually looks better than the garden.

537
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:57,689
Scott: And that's when people leave.

538
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:14,569
Rym: Well, Scott, but Apple had the Steve Jobs like, you know, internal development, that whole like closed system of designing things in a vacuum and and all that testing internally and the compartmentalization of development to the point that they're basically using the technique to write obscenities into the world.

539
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:15,352
Scott: Yeah.

540
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:20,970
Rym: Can obscenities made by the technique compete with evolution in the long term?

541
00:33:21,211 --> 00:33:22,090
Rym: Like maybe it's possible.

542
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:23,654
Rym: So far they have.

543
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:32,250
Rym: So far, what Apple has created on its own has surpassed anything everyone else in the world has ever done in terms of phone interface.

544
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:39,030
Scott: If you wait until right now, the major problem is the fact that there there's this physical lockdown.

545
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:39,573
Scott: Right.

546
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:42,970
Scott: When it came to like AOL, there really wasn't this physical stranglehold.

547
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:45,414
Scott: Right.

548
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:46,910
Scott: So of the carriers.

549
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:52,450
Scott: So you're going to see eventually, you know, once, you know, right now Moore's law, the CPU speed doesn't matter.

550
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,890
Scott: What matters is, you know, the wireless, the spectrum and the antennas and stuff.

551
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:02,270
Scott: Eventually that will break when the technology is sufficiently advanced and people won't need carriers anymore.

552
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:09,388
Scott: And then, you know, the closed off carrier phones are just going to be hosed by the open phones would just be so amazing.

553
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:10,514
Scott: Yeah.

554
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:13,449
Rym: And then and that's I think where we'll see the walled garden break.

555
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,070
Scott: That's only the phone walled garden.

556
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,914
Rym: I don't know, but I'm saying the phone walled garden would have been the most resistant one.

557
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:19,783
Scott: But it just happens to be the current one.

558
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:24,350
Rym: when technology enables behaviors that governments or large corporations don't want.

559
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:30,030
Rym: Like, for example, I'm torrenting and pirating between phones directly all the time.

560
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:32,210
Rym: That won't work through the app store.

561
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:34,609
Rym: But everyone who has an open phone is going to be doing it.

562
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:41,810
Rym: And eventually, you know, Joey Jojo, you know, the 14 year old goes to his friend and says, hey, how come I can't watch the ultra porn that you're streaming?

563
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:44,650
Rym: And you say, well, because you're using an Apple lockdown phone.

564
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:45,596
Rym: He says, oh, really?

565
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,790
Rym: How do I get a non lockdown phone?

566
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:50,382
Rym: Just like back in the day when I was a little kid.

567
00:34:50,402 --> 00:34:53,989
Rym: and I said, hey, Billy, how are you downloading all these goddamn games for free?

568
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,188
Rym: And he said, see this?

569
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,429
Rym: This is a BBS.

570
00:34:57,031 --> 00:34:57,767
Rym: Anything goes.

571
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:58,908
Scott: That's right.

572
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,680
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

573
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,819
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

574
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,262
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion, news and more.

575
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:24,900
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

576
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,416
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

577
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,679
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

578
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:35,840
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
