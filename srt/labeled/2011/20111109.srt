00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,929
Rym: It's Wednesday November 9th 2011.

2
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,255
Rym: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:16,040
Rym: the red line.

4
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:19,778
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:30,532
Rym: So if I had to summarize red line in a sentence, I would say hi this Everybody.

6
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:39,189
Rym: I would say this is the story of a planet called Robo world that is administered by the most incompetent people in the universe.

7
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:45,342
Rym: so Like Robo world fucking up is the real theme of red line.

8
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:47,128
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much all there is to it.

9
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:49,375
Rym: Yeah It's amazing.

10
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:50,559
Rym: What goes on?

11
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:54,390
Rym: the story of red line is so much more insane.

12
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,584
Scott: Well, it's not really isn't about the story of red line, right?

13
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,130
Scott: It's like the story is just an excuse.

14
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:07,066
Rym: Here's what I expected Crazy like animation machine wacky races awesome.

15
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:07,930
Rym: Let's go craziness.

16
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:14,587
Rym: I did not also expect the military of Robo world trying to stop the race and being so incompetent.

17
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:15,169
Rym: Yeah.

18
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:20,248
Scott: So for people don't know right there was this movie called red line that has been hyped.

19
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:22,559
Scott: It's sort of like, you know hyped.

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,370
Rym: it's been ignored by most of the media.

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,174
Scott: Well, it's weird.

22
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:32,810
Scott: right because the fans have been like crazy about it But the everyone else is like it's non-existent, which is why the fans are crazy about it.

23
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,056
Scott: It's sort of like the hipster thing, right?

24
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:35,422
Scott: It's it's this cool thing.

25
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,045
Scott: No one knows about.

26
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:43,110
Scott: we got to make everyone know about it And basically they spent a zillion dollars animating it and tons and tons of time and everything.

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,041
Scott: But it's like how come they didn't actually push it harder?

28
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:48,310
Rym: and the worst thing is those us fans to push it.

29
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:59,900
Rym: This is the kind of movie where if you just took this fucking thing and put it on TV at prime time sometime Just and just market it like check this thing out People would like it for the same reasons.

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,366
Rym: They like to Kara back in the day.

31
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:03,670
Scott: I mean, yes I mean, it's not as good as a Kara now.

32
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:11,529
Rym: but I'm saying a lot of people who aren't anime fans and wouldn't even really know much about What anime is saw Akira in the theater and thought it was really cool.

33
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:15,930
Rym: Yeah, but I saw a ghost in the shell in the theater and thought it was really talking about this a zillion times.

34
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,217
Scott: You know all these things like.

35
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:19,370
Scott: how come they don't market the anime to the normal people?

36
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,637
Scott: Yeah, anime movies come around so rarely.

37
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,523
Rym: This is such a poster child of it.

38
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:24,967
Rym: That is a recent example.

39
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:28,338
Scott: Yes But it's kind of weird because I feel like I've been.

40
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:31,512
Scott: I've been preaching that story of anime movies come around So rarely.

41
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:36,469
Scott: you should watch them all kind of often as in like our enemy who's coming around more often lately.

42
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:38,378
Scott: More shows about.

43
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:40,730
Rym: we pretty much watch every anime movie that comes out.

44
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,680
Scott: Yeah and this one is no exception.

45
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:49,270
Rym: everyone that isn't a Sequel to one piece or Naruto or Pokemon or Pokemon though we did watch.

46
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:53,684
Rym: I've only ever seen one Pokemon movie and that was the one with mommy.

47
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:54,527
Scott: Yeah, the third one.

48
00:02:54,727 --> 00:03:03,223
Scott: I am daddy You are now mommy, but we had echo the sentiments of all the other anime fans people who are like Yeah, red lines the shit.

49
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:03,889
Scott: you got to see this.

50
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,782
Rym: Yeah, if you have if you haven't seen it don't even listen to our review.

51
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:11,230
Rym: just go why you can listen the review Yeah, but go watch it cuz I'm gonna spoil some stuff toward the end though.

52
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,315
Scott: But it's been scientifically demonstrated.

53
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:15,099
Scott: spoilers actually increase enjoyment.

54
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,184
Rym: However, that's one study.

55
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:18,527
Scott: I agree with it.

56
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,300
Rym: Uh, That doesn't in any way impact the legitimacy of the study.

57
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,927
Rym: You have to repeat studies to prove things.

58
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:28,096
Scott: I trust it Okay.

59
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:29,867
Rym: Anyway, captain bias.

60
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:45,030
Rym: Yeah Anyway, you should just watch the movie without even thinking about it because if you're an anime fan Even if you end up hating this movie You can't call yourself an anime fan if you don't watch one of the more important or bigger budget Movies in the medium of your fandom that has come out in recent memory.

61
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:48,482
Rym: Yeah, also this movie is pretty beautiful.

62
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:55,649
Rym: It harkens back to the old era of Extremely detailed like background characters doing wacky stuff and machines.

63
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:57,653
Scott: Yeah, they definitely put.

64
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:02,065
Scott: the number one thing about this movie is the animations right and the arts.

65
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:05,838
Scott: they put a hundred percent effort to It and got a hundred percent quality.

66
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,986
Rym: and not just the foreground a lot of great-looking shows.

67
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:08,247
Rym: today.

68
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,475
Rym: you look in the background There's really nothing going on.

69
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:14,510
Rym: But you look at old anime, especially a lot of the old cell animated stuff.

70
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,990
Rym: You know some guys working on like one bit of the machinery or like one background guy.

71
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,597
Rym: he's got to animate it a little bit and they put a Lot of detail into.

72
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,830
Scott: except when you go to really old anime where it's just a still, you know panning over the still shot.

73
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:36,401
Rym: Yeah, there's an ebb and flow But this has that like every like in these huge crowd scenes during the races every individual dude in the background It's got something going on.

74
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:42,689
Scott: Yep So, yeah, and it's the thing that really gets you is the colors right because the colors are just.

75
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:57,970
Scott: you know They're a lot like the colors in that Justice League comic that we Justice League number one that recently came out Where everything is just really bright and all sorts of like, you know Sort of like neon ish colors But like darker neon and they have like this really great contrast that is like eye candy all the time.

76
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,844
Scott: And there's plenty of scenes where like, you know, there's all.

77
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:04,950
Scott: it's not super deformed But like there's all sorts of like cartoon deformities.

78
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:13,610
Scott: You know of the Looney Tunes style like people stretching out when they go really fast in the cars Or all kinds of stuff like that, but without changing the style.

79
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,730
Scott: It's not like they change it into a cartoony style to do cartoony stuff.

80
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,643
Scott: They like keep it in that style and it's like whoa.

81
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:20,065
Scott: Look at that.

82
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:22,996
Scott: That's crazy So awesome.

83
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:24,079
Rym: It is pretty crazy.

84
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:27,410
Rym: It's I cannot stress this enough watch this movie.

85
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,986
Rym: But yeah, the story of red line is pretty straightforward.

86
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:36,504
Rym: on its surface There is the yellow line, which is one of many f-zero style.

87
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,450
Rym: anything goes crazy races.

88
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:44,418
Scott: yellow line is basically F-3000 and red line is F1 or f-zero.

89
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,970
Rym: I mean in this case yellow line was a qualifier.

90
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:51,650
Scott: I really I think gonna go play a GameCube f-zero because it really just was the best f-zero.

91
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:52,907
Scott: I've gotten in the mood big time.

92
00:05:53,511 --> 00:06:08,686
Rym: but so at red line is like the race like imagine if the Super Bowl and the World Series and the Stanley Cup and Every f1 race were all combined into one Single winner-take-all event at the Super Bowl of racing and not only that.

93
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:12,050
Scott: but there's no rules Right except get to the end first.

94
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,873
Rym: Yeah, anything goes.

95
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:18,297
Scott: you can just kill all the other racers if you really want and there's only like eight racers in it Which is kind of weird.

96
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,671
Scott: Well, the thing is f1 is like 20.

97
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,725
Rym: It is partly implied that people dropped out because they didn't want to know that there were.

98
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:31,298
Scott: there were eight people in originally I'm too drunk dropped out because the plot happened Which is the red line.

99
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:35,335
Scott: people decided that the race this year was gonna be held on Robo world.

100
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:41,126
Rym: now to put this into an analogy to the real world That would be as though we had an f1 race.

101
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:56,560
Rym: That was Like yeah blatantly anti-korea like if the race Enraged Korean people culturally like it there and we decided that we were going to host it in North Korea in their capital against their wishes.

102
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:03,903
Scott: Well, it's like, you know, the red line is like governed by Some you know Oregon the red line or racing organization.

103
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:07,135
Rym: and they're like, yes, let's put it in robo Fucking hate.

104
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:10,610
Scott: like not under the purview of any government whatsoever.

105
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,884
Scott: It's like this independent thing like the galaxy railways its own thing.

106
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:17,997
Scott: So it's like I guess FIFA, right so FIFA is its own thing.

107
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:18,859
Scott: it governs soccer.

108
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,188
Scott: So FIFA was like, yeah, we're putting the World Cup in rims bathroom.

109
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,338
Scott: Yeah, that's where it's going.

110
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:29,755
Rym: And right now there's no saying they're like It's gonna be in a robo world.

111
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:35,049
Scott: and then the movie gets to Rym gets home one day and like Pele's in his bathroom Kicking the soccer ball, you know.

112
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:42,553
Rym: And then it cuts to the high government of robo world and the president is like what the fuck I'm gonna kill.

113
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:43,497
Rym: all of them.

114
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:44,500
Rym: fuck racing.

115
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:45,203
Rym: This sucks.

116
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:51,230
Scott: He's like anyone if you when you show up I'm going to send the military of robo world to just to kill the people in your race.

117
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:53,740
Scott: So basically the course of the movie.

118
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,469
Scott: if you think the weird if you take the other meaning of the word race You could say robo world was genociding because he was killing an entire race.

119
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,796
Scott: Anyway, that was terrible.

120
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:04,244
Scott: it was terrible, but the I don't.

121
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:05,930
Rym: I don't want to really like spoil a lot.

122
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:11,070
Rym: But basically the robo world military and like government apparatus are going to stop this.

123
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:13,790
Scott: Well, the first which is like which is happening illegally.

124
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,761
Scott: Well, the reason is like why does robo world even want to stop?

125
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:18,970
Scott: the race wouldn't erase usually boost your economy.

126
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,530
Rym: Well, like I said, just go back to the North Korea analogy.

127
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:29,790
Rym: So not only is the race like in the center of the capital of North Korea But the finish line is on top of their most secret military base, right?

128
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:35,770
Scott: So basically robo robo world is just really afraid of their military secrets on their planet being shown to the world.

129
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,957
Rym: They also on galaxy-wide television.

130
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:41,130
Rym: They also appear to hate races and hate people, right?

131
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,547
Scott: So, you know, there's a leader of robo world that he's got two assistants one volt.

132
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:46,290
Scott: What's his name?

133
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,033
Rym: Oh a captive court.

134
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:59,090
Scott: colonel volt on right who is colonel volt on is basically sort of like the badass like quiet Powerful evil dude and then the other like Oh Kefka kind of evil, dude.

135
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,469
Rym: I thought that guy was gonna be a square boss, but it turns out he just doesn't give up.

136
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:15,381
Rym: He's just like whatever just a crazy killer, but he keeps coming down Like he'll be like the president's like arm the hyper disintegrator and the guy's like, okay He's like, oh, yeah hyper disintegrator didn't work.

137
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:18,450
Rym: what it was broken by the racers.

138
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,697
Scott: Oh, we can use the disintegrator again.

139
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:28,101
Rym: Now the most he's the second most unflappable guy in the world second only to Machine machine has the best.

140
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,730
Rym: machine head is my favorite character.

141
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,939
Scott: She is my favorite because of all these are seen.

142
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:34,630
Rym: apparently machine head is one the last seven red lines.

143
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:40,890
Scott: Yeah, he's basically the Tiger Woods Roger Federer Michael Jordan, but he's a giant Michael Schumacher.

144
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,355
Rym: He is his car.

145
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:43,338
Rym: He races.

146
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:45,444
Rym: He's like, you know, you drive a car.

147
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:47,813
Rym: I fucking am a car That's right.

148
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,179
Scott: I can't lose a machine head.

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:58,522
Scott: and the thing the thing that I liked about machine head Right was the even though he's basically Michael Schumacher Right, and even though he's like that You know the the guy that the real main character has to be in the race.

150
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:07,475
Scott: any other movie ultra in the bad guy exactly, and like if he normally would have been the evil team like in Mighty Ducks or Shaolin soccer, but he wasn't.

151
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:09,040
Scott: he was actually an okay guy.

152
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,742
Scott: It's just.

153
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:12,050
Scott: he was also the best racer in the galaxy.

154
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,664
Rym: There's this great scene where someone's giving him shit and he's like like he stands.

155
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:18,650
Rym: some guy stands in his way in a restaurant.

156
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,336
Rym: I mean shit looks.

157
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:23,841
Rym: him is like you'd better move or I'll be forced to walk around you.

158
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:25,648
Scott: Yeah, and it's like it's bad.

159
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:26,290
Scott: What's even better?

160
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,920
Scott: Is it the pretty visual like what machine had looks like?

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,044
Rym: Oh my god.

162
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:31,590
Scott: He looks like a giant guy.

163
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:31,911
Scott: He's.

164
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:32,715
Scott: he's gigantic.

165
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:35,910
Scott: He's gonna be the bad guy, but actually he's not a bad guy.

166
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,596
Scott: There's a scene like he's petting a dog.

167
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:38,821
Rym: He has a really cute dog.

168
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:39,604
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

169
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:41,190
Rym: it's like he also has a theme song.

170
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:42,148
Rym: That's just machine.

171
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:47,606
Scott: That just makes me really like him because it's like if he was the evil team I would have been like Oh evil team boo.

172
00:10:48,672 --> 00:10:54,470
Rym: This is where this movie I think extends beyond what I would call a typical movie or an anime or whatever.

173
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,669
Scott: That's what separates it from Hanna-Barbera's wacky races.

174
00:10:56,931 --> 00:11:00,890
Rym: It's that it threw me for a loop a bunch of times that I saw something happen.

175
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:10,918
Rym: I said and Scott and I were like, oh duh now X is going to happen as a result of this and about half the time Something so unexpected happened.

176
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:14,090
Scott: Well, it was weird like cuz I could predict five seconds in the future.

177
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:17,095
Scott: Right, like they were in the early in the movie I was like, oh that's that.

178
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:24,750
Scott: and then literally as soon as I finished talking they said what I said Yeah, and I was like, oh shit, but then you know, I couldn't predict the long run.

179
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,897
Scott: I was like, well, here's the possibilities for the long run.

180
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:30,910
Scott: They win they lose they crash, you know, it's like every possibility.

181
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:33,025
Scott: So I had no idea where it's going.

182
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:33,550
Scott: long term.

183
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:38,278
Scott: I could only predict like five seconds out which is pretty good But it threw me for a loop so many times.

184
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:54,021
Rym: and the things that threw me for a loop because it had a really cut Together style like in one hand is following the kind of main character plot and then on another hand like a second angle is following the government of robo world Incompetently trying to stop this race with its entire planetary military might.

185
00:11:54,623 --> 00:12:02,485
Rym: and then the third angle is just like Interviews and news clips and character profiles and just kind of showing you.

186
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,998
Scott: it's showing you like two different worlds You're learning about.

187
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,370
Scott: it's like almost three different worlds.

188
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:14,010
Scott: It's showing you an exploration of the world of this galaxy this this civilization Also the world of robo world.

189
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,650
Scott: What's it like and what the community of racing fans and racing participants of?

190
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,756
Scott: Red line and yellow line are like.

191
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:25,890
Scott: so it's like, you know, it really fills in every possible gap in the movie.

192
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,050
Scott: But in the end all of this plot really doesn't matter which is great.

193
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:35,990
Scott: All this plot is is an excuse to have insanely awesomely animated action scenes.

194
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:39,359
Rym: The crazy I think because you had a carry of defense titan

195
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:53,075
Scott: and I think the robo world trying to destroy the race is the ultimate excuse because what you can do is you can alternate between scenes of racing action and scenes of exploding military fighting action and Both at the same time.

196
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:57,030
Scott: so it's like climax of the movie is this gigantic running battle race?

197
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,452
Scott: Yes, like.

198
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:58,820
Scott: there is no sure it's like.

199
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,907
Scott: if you could go to normal like a mecha show it's all fighting or like a racing show will be all racing, you know.

200
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:12,304
Scott: and But by combining the two You're basically like like doubling down on the insane things that can happen.

201
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:19,765
Scott: and then they push it all the way to the limit Literally with what's the star speckled whatever the streamlight streamlight?

202
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:21,670
Scott: Yeah, they put it to the limit with the stream.

203
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,059
Rym: But there's so many just great iconic scenes like the.

204
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:38,390
Rym: the robo world police keep like busting in unlike people because a bunch of people in robo world want to bet on the race because they think it's awesome and the Please bust in and the police basically just fucking murder everybody, you know, they yeah the police robots.

205
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:44,248
Rym: Yeah, it's sort of like bots like this little cute police bots like please disperse and then it starts firing missiles.

206
00:13:44,568 --> 00:14:02,228
Rym: It's great And like the race the yellow line race You I love the culture of racing because if you ever see a real rally like a real US or world like there are any US rallies Anyway an earth rally in the real world.

207
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:10,805
Rym: today 2011 people will stand as Close to the most dangerous corners as they can as packed in as tightly as they can.

208
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:15,190
Scott: when and when the car is on its Way, they'll run out into the road and watch the car come at them.

209
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,370
Scott: Then when the car is about to hit them They'll run out of the way and go back to watch the car go around the corner.

210
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,969
Scott: Then they'll run out onto the track and watch and run and follow the car so they can see it.

211
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:27,296
Scott: leave To see the car as much as possible.

212
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:34,023
Rym: the culture of racing in red line is the same way except that thousands die at every Corner every time anyone comes by.

213
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:41,185
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it's like because it's animated they're like and we can just do all sorts of ridiculous shit.

214
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:45,383
Scott: people died all over the place You know cars exploding whatever the fuck.

215
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:46,750
Scott: they didn't give a shit, right?

216
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,201
Scott: so the the plus the physics be damned.

217
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:58,774
Rym: aside from Robo world being Amazingly incompetent as a love story and surprisingly evil is that we've got the main guy JP who has an Intergalactic pompadour.

218
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:01,689
Rym: it is it is a pompadour to be to be.

219
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:03,436
Scott: It is not.

220
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,890
Scott: it is not as feared as the one in kamikaze girls.

221
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:12,510
Rym: So the thing is and I think this is actually my favorite thing in the movie because it only comes up twice.

222
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:15,727
Rym: Mm-hmm JP isn't is driven by two things in his life.

223
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:20,373
Rym: one He met a girl when he was young and into cars It was totally hot.

224
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:21,236
Rym: who's totally hot?

225
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:24,006
Rym: and he just really likes her and he really likes racing.

226
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:30,103
Rym: Yeah, too He saw who I can only guess is the god of pimps.

227
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:32,470
Scott: Oh, right the god of it.

228
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,916
Rym: There's the scene in the beginning.

229
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:37,010
Scott: It's the fact that you forget about it because it's like it's twice.

230
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:40,861
Scott: Basically, the god of pimps is like in one in one.

231
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,187
Scott: It's you know, they get one piece this red-haired shanks.

232
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:44,090
Scott: That's right.

233
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,704
Scott: It's like the guy that luffy is always thinking about like what would red-haired shanks do right.

234
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:54,269
Rym: the god of pimps is He's the god of pimps, but so in the beginning the movie get this flash back.

235
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:54,994
Scott: You know what?

236
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:59,928
Scott: I've upgraded him above machine head best character in the movie machine heads number two.

237
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,560
Rym: But you basically see this guy who is Akio times 10.

238
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,446
Rym: Akio would blow his load even looking at this.

239
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:07,434
Scott: definitely I guarantee a hundred Percent.

240
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:10,694
Scott: I'll bet money that they were inspired Slightly by Akio.

241
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:15,647
Scott: when making the god of there is he does the same car flip into the convertible.

242
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:16,610
Scott: that there is no way.

243
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:17,550
Rym: This is not the case.

244
00:16:17,864 --> 00:16:24,210
Rym: but Black dynamite could learn a lot from the kid the god of pimps and for black dynamite to be able to learn for something from somebody.

245
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:34,573
Rym: As JP a young JP looks on this guy flips over into his amazing car and kisses two women Simultaneously.

246
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:35,939
Rym: and you might think what do you mean?

247
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,124
Rym: How literally you'll see.

248
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:43,450
Rym: he kisses two women Simultaneously And drives off into the sunset.

249
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:49,390
Rym: You see the kid the god of pimps one more time in the movie and I will not spoil it.

250
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:51,668
Rym: What happens in that scene is?

251
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,272
Rym: Great.

252
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:58,954
Scott: It is the greatest part of this movie is definitely the number one Part of the entire.

253
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:05,950
Scott: you will know it when it happens because it is the number two part of the movie is When the dude rescues the dude is gonna get killed.

254
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,884
Rym: Oh my god, cuz that comes out of nowhere is a big O scenario.

255
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:09,964
Scott: Yep.

256
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,770
Rym: It's like why don't they Joe?

257
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,679
Rym: They just did Oh times 10.

258
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,810
Rym: Oh and then one other twist happen when he hits the button thing.

259
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:19,093
Scott: That's great.

260
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:19,515
Scott: Yeah.

261
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:19,896
Scott: Yeah.

262
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:27,130
Scott: I mean this movie, you know, I While there's it's basically just so many awesome parts, right?

263
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:31,110
Scott: It's just awesome part after awesome part after awesome part with awesome animation.

264
00:17:31,513 --> 00:17:34,030
Scott: But I I don't really remember any music from it.

265
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,619
Rym: Do you up the closing the credits theme?

266
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,763
Rym: because all right, that's really like the song from the credits And it's okay song that song see.

267
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:44,387
Rym: when I first heard about red line I didn't hear anything about it.

268
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:51,213
Rym: Someone sent me a link and it was a trailer for a red line and I had that song and it had that song and that Trailer amazed me.

269
00:17:51,394 --> 00:18:03,230
Rym: Yep, but I was trying to keep my expectations low, even though the trailer filled me with a Surprising desire like we're talking like point four or five ponies worth of anticipation.

270
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:07,930
Rym: Yeah, and the fact that the movie lived up to that feeling really surprised me.

271
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:12,443
Scott: But while it is just this crazy awesome thing, but what are you gonna say?

272
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:15,597
Scott: Well, it's it's not like a life-changing movie.

273
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:19,162
Rym: there's no depth or No, there is depth, but it's not.

274
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:23,930
Rym: it's not deep To a degree that it's no Shakespeare the story.

275
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:29,570
Rym: It's not even a shake guy likes girl and also wants to be like the god of pimps.

276
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:33,101
Scott: So he pursues that and he gets into racing and then racing.

277
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:34,406
Rym: He's actually a really nice guy.

278
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:39,797
Rym: Like I like him and also Robo world The government of Robo world king offense.

279
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:44,368
Rym: the evil of the government of Robo world is eclipsed only by its incompetence.

280
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:54,229
Scott: That's right And that's pretty much all there is to it I think by the end of the movie the entire military of Robo world as a planetary system is gone Destroyed by the race.

281
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:59,081
Scott: But basically this is I would recommend this right.

282
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:04,840
Scott: this is basically in the same category as like You know the Lupin movies that aren't the castle of Cagliostre, right?

283
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,406
Scott: You bust like a mom.

284
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:07,630
Scott: Oh, well, not like mama.

285
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,636
Scott: Oh mama's like fume of conspiracy.

286
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:10,579
Rym: Columbus egg.

287
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,484
Scott: Sure Columbus egg a gold.

288
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,330
Scott: It was a gold battle on gold.

289
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,623
Scott: No, it's not like Babylon going, you know, you bust it's not.

290
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:19,410
Scott: you know, I'm not talking about the level of quality.

291
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,996
Scott: I'm saying is in the category right.

292
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:29,506
Scott: you bust this movie out at the party when everyone's over you watch it and go Show to the people who are drunk at a party like fuck that anime whatever.

293
00:19:29,526 --> 00:19:30,490
Scott: but you can't put it.

294
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,124
