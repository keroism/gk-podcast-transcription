00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,547
Rym: It's Monday March 28th.

2
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:13,675
Rym: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:15,380
Rym: the humble log file.

4
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:18,707
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:29,231
Rym: So this I understood what I'm about to talk about.

6
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:37,024
Rym: like I expected it to take a while to edit 1080p 60 frames a second video and Make it into something.

7
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:41,220
Rym: it took way longer than I could have possibly anticipated.

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,980
Scott: Well, I mean I mean the editing part is the editing part shouldn't have taken any longer than with standard definition video.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,564
Scott: It's only the part of the rendering.

10
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:50,068
Scott: right the processing.

11
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:59,966
Rym: well the rendering for 20 minutes of HD video after I did all the like Camera changes and zoom in and out and everything and I had like my project done Was about two hours.

12
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,715
Rym: so about an hour per 10 minutes of videos.

13
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,280
Scott: that part takes a lot longer.

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,080
Scott: But I mean in just actually editing the video should just you know I mean it's higher definitions.

15
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:11,879
Scott: But it you know it's the same thing cut and paste same amount of time.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,080
Rym: Yeah, no because before when I edited video right it was always crappy video.

17
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:19,629
Rym: There's nothing I could do to it to make it look better.

18
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,400
Scott: Oh, so because it was HD you were doing more things.

19
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:36,028
Rym: Yep, like for example in this I could zoom in on you or on me when the other one of us is picking our nose on stage But I had to actually sit there and be like up rims picking his nose all right got a zoom in on Scott Still picking.

20
00:01:36,169 --> 00:01:42,198
Scott: all right, maybe we'll cut to a slide But with standard definitions there was no way you could zoom because the resolution would so low.

21
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:48,774
Scott: yeah But if you saw that video we did for magfest yeah But if it's 1080p's then you could actually zoom in and it would still be 720p's.

22
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:52,290
Scott: yeah Which is plenty of peas.

23
00:01:52,370 --> 00:02:01,240
Scott: it looked just fine, especially because we're not ponies We're just two guys, and then if you down sampled the full zoom to 720p The whole thing will be the same resolution even though you're zooming in on people.

24
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,800
Rym: Yeah, give or take and you know what it worked out pretty well.

25
00:02:04,186 --> 00:02:16,355
Rym: I'm proud, but It saddens me even though I understand all the reasons why and I'm not complaining about it that Kanye pony video I made in like a half-hour has like 5,000 views.

26
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:17,780
Rym: yeah, so it is big nights.

27
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:18,706
Scott: So does my.

28
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:19,069
Scott: oh my gosh.

29
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:19,351
Scott: Oh my gosh.

30
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:19,633
Scott: Oh my gosh.

31
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:20,479
Scott: Oh my gosh.

32
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,017
Rym: I Think part of it is that there was a dearth of pony material for a long time on the internet.

33
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:25,460
Rym: that was good.

34
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:29,779
Rym: So anything that was even like a two out of five got tons of views.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,100
Scott: yep.

36
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:42,184
Rym: But yeah the other problem is that I didn't make a pax show with the video or anything yet because I have 100 gigabytes of video to watch and figure out what's worth keeping And you gotta submit to the pax.

37
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:44,150
Rym: community DVD already did.

38
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:47,420
Rym: but here's the trouble with flicker with pictures.

39
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,519
Rym: You probably do what I do.

40
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:52,911
Rym: I just take all my pictures And I look at every one of them and when in doubt I keep it.

41
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:55,340
Rym: cuz who cares doesn't take up any space exactly.

42
00:02:56,522 --> 00:03:00,480
Rym: Yeah, I can't do that when every convention generates about a hundred gigabytes of video.

43
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:01,162
Scott: Why not?

44
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,670
Rym: because I don't have that much storage space.

45
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,640
Scott: you could do on a terabyte drive you do ten conventions.

46
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,155
Scott: We have two years for a hundred bucks.

47
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:09,699
Scott: You can do it.

48
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,909
Rym: Yeah, if I keep it all and I don't do anything with it because if I want to actually do something with it I gotta bring it local before I open it right.

49
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,133
Scott: so you always you have one.

50
00:03:18,254 --> 00:03:25,639
Scott: you have a terabyte drive that you use for All your current editings right yep, and when you actually get the finished video It's only a few hundred megabytes.

51
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,425
Rym: No, no you kidding.

52
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:28,909
Rym: Are you kidding?

53
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:29,150
Rym: the?

54
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:35,237
Rym: the triple threat that I put online got just the YouTube the 720p Rendered versions, how big do you think that was?

55
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,025
Scott: Like for how much video?

56
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:38,467
Scott: how long it's?

57
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:39,270
Rym: 58 minutes of video 720p.

58
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:46,260
Scott: That should only be like like you know a few hundred megabytes.

59
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:47,626
Rym: Oh, you know.

60
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,458
Scott: now wait are you talking about the raw avi's?

61
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:50,800
Rym: no?

62
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,808
Rym: I'm talking about the h.264.

63
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:54,916
Scott: h.264 should be a lot smaller than that.

64
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:55,900
Scott: No you did it wrong.

65
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,240
Scott: No, I didn't because you can download full-length feature-length blu-ray rips that are not that big.

66
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:05,980
Rym: Yeah, and part of it is like three hour movies if you're ready.

67
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:07,928
Rym: I rendered it the way YouTube said.

68
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:15,972
Rym: this is exactly how you should render it for YouTube And it was about 700 megabytes per 20 megabyte or not?

69
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:19,140
Rym: 20 megabyte 20 minute shot on YouTube.

70
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,745
Scott: Anyway, but you the thing is the.

71
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:25,857
Scott: you the encodings that YouTube has are gonna be you try to download the h.264 from YouTube.

72
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,594
Rym: It's gonna be a lot smaller that you download the highest quality version actually.

73
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:31,377
Rym: It's the same size.

74
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,907
Rym: It's almost the same file I uploaded.

75
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:35,480
Scott: hmm That's very straight anyway.

76
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:42,270
Rym: However the cool thing is I don't need to keep those because I can just re-render anytime I want from the project.

77
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,299
Scott: well it takes forever though.

78
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:44,182
Rym: Yeah How big do you think?

79
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:44,604
Rym: the point is?

80
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:48,020
Scott: you have a working drive that you use for the video currently working on and then in?

81
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,265
Scott: Storage drives.

82
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:51,795
Scott: you need a terabyte every two years.

83
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:52,940
Scott: not a problem.

84
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:58,958
Rym: Yeah, that's only for those conventions if I never do any other video like a certain project.

85
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,534
Scott: We're talking about yeah Okay, so you know what they have two terabyte drives now and soon.

86
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:03,660
Scott: They'll have five terabyte drives.

87
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,426
Scott: You know what they have now.

88
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:09,450
Rym: six hundred megabyte SSDs huh six hundred megabytes.

89
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:10,857
Rym: Yeah, that's a lot.

90
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:11,580
Scott: I mean gigabytes.

91
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:15,959
Scott: I Remember sorry sorry gigabytes.

92
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:16,806
Scott: I remember

93
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:23,745
Rym: when I was a kid and one of my friends was like yeah I copied the CD to my computer, and I was like you goddamn motherfucker I full installed

94
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:29,895
Scott: mech warrior 2 500 megabyte on my 720 megabyte hard drive because

95
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,915
Rym: you were in the same boat I was in when you were a kid.

96
00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:35,494
Rym: the Computer was yours to control because no one else in the family knew what was up.

97
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,329
Scott: and then I delete it and then I would Install full install something else.

98
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:41,560
Scott: yeah, it would be so fast Because you fold install.

99
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:50,280
Scott: But I mean one time my mom everyone that was that was you people don't remember like back in the day That was that when you install the game It would actually say do you want to do the wuss install or read off the CD?

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,160
Scott: Do you want to do the medium install the full install?

101
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,745
Rym: So it always had the full installs.

102
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:57,218
Rym: full install was like the ludicrous option like no way no one's ever gonna do.

103
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,037
Scott: sometimes There'll be five different options of how much you want to install to the disk nowadays.

104
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:02,760
Scott: There's none of that.

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,180
Scott: It's just install and that's it you must install.

106
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,671
Rym: I remember trying to give my mom level of install.

107
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:11,930
Rym: buy me a second CD rom drive So I wouldn't have to swap CDs so often.

108
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:16,386
Rym: Yeah, we're playing like winkamander or Under a Killing Moon Tex Murphy.

109
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:18,855
Rym: Yeah, that was a seven or phantasmagoria.

110
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:20,280
Rym: It was like seven or eight CDs.

111
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:23,099
Scott: Oh, yeah, I've been like one DVD.

112
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:36,190
Rym: but I remember a couple of times my parents would complain because the computer ran out of space and I and Basically they didn't realize this because I had deleted everything and filled it up with games On my 540 megabyte hard drive.

113
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:44,580
Scott: pretty much like install a game delete a game install a game Delete a game install a game, you know, yeah, but I remembered like when I figured out oh the save files are there.

114
00:06:44,782 --> 00:06:45,934
Rym: I'm gonna back those up.

115
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,359
Scott: That's right.

116
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:49,570
Rym: So anyway, it's Monday.

117
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,680
Rym: we haven't done a Monday show in a while.

118
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,992
Rym: We haven't done a lot of GeekNights in a while.

119
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,038
Scott: do a lot of GeekNights.

120
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:58,212
Rym: now We're gonna try to not miss an episode at least until anime Boston.

121
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,480
Scott: Well, yeah, hopefully we won't even miss one.

122
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,564
Scott: Then let's get one in the hopper.

123
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:02,809
Rym: Yeah, we could do that.

124
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:03,371
Rym: We could do that.

125
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:03,773
Rym: Of course.

126
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,903
Rym: We have to make more RFE RFE.

127
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:07,266
Scott: Yeah.

128
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:07,467
Rym: Yeah.

129
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:09,340
Rym: Yeah that other project anyway.

130
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:13,439
Rym: So got a tech news got a tech news.

131
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,298
Scott: There's been a ton of tech news, but there's only one that I really want to talk about.

132
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:17,950
Scott: really Yeah, let's talk about geo hots.

133
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:19,924
Rym: Ah Geo hots.

134
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,032
Scott: Do you know the deal with geo hot?

135
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:21,716
Rym: I know the deal.

136
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:23,486
Rym: Okay So what do you want to talk about?

137
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:26,539
Rym: the the act of doing it the act of disseminated it?

138
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,180
Rym: Do we want to talk about the ludicrous lawsuits?

139
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,824
Scott: Well, I want to talk about.

140
00:07:30,924 --> 00:07:41,833
Scott: he's fighting back against the lawsuit, right and this is the interesting part is is that it's you know There's a whole thing on grok law that has all the loi-ing right.

141
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:44,603
Scott: if you are if you cuz I'm obviously gonna get it all Completely wrong.

142
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:47,112
Rym: Yeah, we are not lawyers as you listeners.

143
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,618
Rym: Tell us on a daily basis.

144
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:54,159
Scott: No kidding But basically he's fighting back and it's actually really interesting.

145
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,420
Scott: now He's fighting back of course mostly in a very loy way saying the jurisdiction is wrong, right?

146
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,800
Rym: I had a game as a kid called jurisdiction and you had to object to questioning in court.

147
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:07,244
Scott: Uh-huh.

148
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:08,615
Rym: That's all I got.

149
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:14,920
Scott: Okay So he's basically saying like look you shouldn't be able to sue me in California or wherever it is.

150
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,099
Scott: You should have to sue me in Jersey where I live.

151
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:21,187
Scott: It's like you know that because it's like hey You know, I live in Jersey.

152
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:24,500
Scott: if this crime was committed if there was a crime committed it was in Jersey.

153
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:25,880
Scott: That's you should have to come after me.

154
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,314
Scott: You shouldn't be able to have to come out to me in California just because I own a blog.

155
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:36,893
Rym: it's I as a non lawyer agree with that Assuming there's many other reasons assuming that his hosting is also in Jersey.

156
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:38,238
Scott: I don't think it's those things in Jersey.

157
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:38,820
Scott: Well, where is it?

158
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,323
Scott: I don't know.

159
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:40,817
Scott: I think that I think that's where they're getting him.

160
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:41,080
Scott: I don't know.

161
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,895
Scott: That's weird like that because there's many other reasons for his trying to move the jurisdictions, right?

162
00:08:47,476 --> 00:08:48,038
Scott: One of them.

163
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,414
Scott: It's like M Where was it?

164
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:59,320
Scott: They couldn't prove that they had yet to offer any proof that he accepted the PS the PlayStation Network terms of service.

165
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:00,479
Scott: right.

166
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:08,380
Scott: They failed to offer any proof that the terms of service could be applicable to him even assuming everything they said is true.

167
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:15,859
Scott: There's also a bunch of questions that he's being sued by Sony America as CEA Sony Computer Entertainment America, right?

168
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:24,095
Scott: But if you look on a PlayStation 3 box Everything on the box says all rights Sony in Japan.

169
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:26,826
Scott: So like SCEA Are you even allowed to sue him?

170
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,333
Scott: Sony Japan should have to sue.

171
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,760
Scott: Sony Japan is the owner.

172
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,927
Rym: I didn't even think of that.

173
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:36,008
Scott: Right and it's it's all this stuff That's you know, especially the stuff pertaining to terms of service.

174
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:37,352
Scott: That is extremely interesting.

175
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:48,628
Scott: plus it's like his is a hardware hack theoretically Right, oh there's also and all these terms of service are for the software and they can't even prove that he accepted terms of service For the software or bought any software.

176
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:49,492
Scott: It was just hardware.

177
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:54,369
Scott: So it's like ooh Does the GMC even apply to the hardware?

178
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,056
Scott: it's a physical thing and it's not.

179
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,220
Scott: he's not caught right?

180
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,745
Scott: It's not a GMCA issue.

181
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,060
Rym: then never mind all the weird follow-up complications.

182
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,603
Rym: Why did it?

183
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:04,514
Rym: when someone is there firmwares?

184
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:05,640
Scott: Is that now software?

185
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:13,747
Rym: Remember when someone tweeted it at a Sony guy and he retweeted it with an answer like a response Yeah, Sony published the code.

186
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:14,148
Scott: Yep.

187
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:15,533
Rym: I can tell you the code.

188
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:17,820
Rym: the code is short enough to tattoo on my arm.

189
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,560
Scott: But yeah read this thing on grok law, right?

190
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:37,809
Scott: Which has all the loi-ing bits for you lawyers and it's really really interesting and it should make nerds Kind of excited to see someone fight back Against this kind of thing at least a little bit if we can even get a tiny victory out of this like Terms of service not applicable.

191
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,100
Scott: Oh, well, I miss extremely small case.

192
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:46,699
Rym: I recall ribbon Scott circa 2005 saying something very important that is coming up yet again someday.

193
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:56,279
Rym: someday terms of service and shrink-wrap are going to really be tested in court and Whichever way that bone falls we win.

194
00:10:57,002 --> 00:11:11,483
Rym: Yeah, because if terms of service are as draconian and restrictive and able to be applied to people as the court governments and corporations Want them to be I'm putting some crazy shrink-wrap on everything I ever do and if they're not Party time.

195
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,429
Rym: Oh my you know, but yeah, it's good.

196
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:14,753
Scott: You know, I think this is most.

197
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,780
Scott: this is probably not gonna be anything like that.

198
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,649
Scott: It's just a jurisdiction battle, you know, but it's still.

199
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:23,080
Scott: it's still pretty neat to see someone try to fight.

200
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:24,580
Rym: So are we in accord here though?

201
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,360
Rym: I think in terms of the actual I don't think that any crime was committed at any point.

202
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:29,199
Scott: I don't think so.

203
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:38,380
Scott: Now I would agree that if someone used and I definitely don't think even if there was a crime committed You know, I definitely don't think any moral wrong was done.

204
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,164
Scott: Well, here's the thing.

205
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:49,170
Rym: if say someone else using the information He provided made a bootleg copy of a game signed it all legit and then sold it in outright piracy form All

206
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,377
Scott: right

207
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:54,960
Rym: I think that guy is liable for all the copyright stuff and I would be cool with that guy going to jail

208
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:55,442
Scott: Yeah,

209
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:57,090
Rym: but I'm not cool with one.

210
00:11:57,452 --> 00:12:05,324
Rym: that guy going to jail longer than a murderer That's for sure - that guy being fined more than the money in the world That's also true.

211
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:08,073
Rym: or three geohot in any way being culpable.

212
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:08,514
Rym: Yep.

213
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:13,096
Rym: I mean, it's like if I tell you hey Scott Did you know you could put bullets and guns and then you shoot a bunch of people?

214
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:13,680
Rym: Is that my fault?

215
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,563
Scott: No, it's like.

216
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:21,380
Scott: why does uh, you know if that was the case then like, you know The heckler and Koch people who would be in jail like that of the death penalty.

217
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:29,806
Rym: This is why the DMCA bothers me say I buy I don't know a box of muffins and in the box of muffins There's just a little wooden box.

218
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:32,879
Rym: It says do not open or I will sue you and there's nothing even in the box.

219
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:34,259
Rym: how like.

220
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,149
Rym: That's what the DMCA is.

221
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:41,715
Rym: They're basically saying they can sue you They can take you to court because you open a box that you bought and own.

222
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:42,639
Rym: that was given to you.

223
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:49,980
Scott: yeah, it's like it says don't remove tag for mattress or whatever, but Well, I'm allowed to remove that because I'm the end user.

224
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,462
Rym: I can't.

225
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:57,438
Rym: I'm just saying I cannot resell the mattress without that tab, but I can't resell a mattress anyway, because you bugs.

226
00:12:58,701 --> 00:12:59,565
Scott: We live in New York now.

227
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:03,320
Scott: The point is right is you know, there's the old thing about removing tags for mattresses, right?

228
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,640
Scott: It's like you can't buzz me for removing the tag from my own mattress.

229
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:10,964
Scott: You know if I want to un DRM my own the own thing I bought an iTunes.

230
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:17,837
Rym: now if I redistribute the thing I bought an iTunes publicly then yes I don't think that's morally wrong, but it is technically legally wrong.

231
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:18,360
Rym: And you know what?

232
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,256
Rym: I'm okay with the court system going after that.

233
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:21,960
Rym: I'm just I'm.

234
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:26,797
Rym: I'm one of the nerds is only mad when they actually come into my personal computer.

235
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:32,416
Rym: Yeah Anyway, so there's an article on slashdot and one of my co-workers get this.

236
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:33,800
Rym: he had never heard of slashdot.

237
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,892
Rym: He's a super techie smart guy who just never heard of it.

238
00:13:36,093 --> 00:13:36,696
Scott: Well, how is he?

239
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:37,240
Scott: How old is he?

240
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,298
Rym: He's like two or three years younger than us.

241
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:40,844
Scott: Okay, that makes sense.

242
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:42,770
Scott: cuz slashdot faded and other things came.

243
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:44,616
Rym: he's already of course.

244
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:45,619
Rym: so I was so.

245
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,230
Rym: one day I was like you should read slashdot.

246
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:47,693
Rym: He's like what.

247
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:48,660
Rym: why isn't it weird?

248
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,679
Scott: How like we were NES and 16-bit kids, right?

249
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,262
Scott: Yeah, people just a few years younger than us like people who were freshmen in college when we were just slightly more than freshmen in College.

250
00:13:58,624 --> 00:13:59,689
Scott: they were all PlayStation.

251
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:00,051
Scott: It's like that.

252
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:03,991
Scott: the NES and 16-bit era was like really long.

253
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:08,448
Scott: if you're just a couple years younger than us How could you be PlayStation which is the generation after?

254
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:09,351
Rym: look at childhood.

255
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,000
Rym: you me and all of our friends who were two three even?

256
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,741
Rym: Four years older than us are clearly children of the 80s like the 80s really 90s.

257
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:20,753
Scott: the thing is we knew 80s cuz we lived for eight years.

258
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:22,198
Scott: We also knew 90s.

259
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,713
Scott: Here's the thing we were children 90s more than we knew.

260
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:28,070
Rym: we knew the 90s But we were children of the 80s.

261
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:33,915
Scott: like our cultural heritage Is more 90s and 80s but there is still.

262
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:34,920
Scott: it's a great deal of both.

263
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,900
Scott: It's like look it's like 60 40 60 90s 48.

264
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,825
Rym: So you're not letting me finish.

265
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:42,140
Rym: a lot of our friends who were three four even five years older than us who?

266
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,847
Rym: Remember a lot more of the 80s?

267
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,500
Rym: their childhood culture is almost identical to ours.

268
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:53,040
Rym: Yet people who are even one or two years younger than us have a completely different childhood culture.

269
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,486
Scott: There was some sort of barrier there.

270
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,455
Rym: There's there was a line where something happened.

271
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:57,319
Rym: I'm not sure like what?

272
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,066
Rym: Cultural event it was.

273
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:04,107
Scott: it's like people born in like, you know 87 88 like the late 80s.

274
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:05,292
Scott: It's like they were all.

275
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:06,376
Scott: they're like completely different.

276
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:07,280
Scott: They're all PlayStation.

277
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:08,694
Scott: They somehow missed 8 and 16 bits.

278
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:14,139
Rym: I mean people born in 1984 actually don't remember a lot of things that are just common knowledge to the 82s.

279
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:17,153
Rym: Could two years be that much of a difference?

280
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:18,219
Scott: I don't know.

281
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:20,858
Rym: But anyway, it was interesting that he's like.

282
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,646
Rym: hey Did you see this article on reddit?

283
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:25,337
Rym: and I'm like, huh an article on reddit.

284
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:26,020
Rym: Did I see it?

285
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,319
Rym: You didn't give me any clues as to what this article is about.

286
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:31,854
Rym: So I'm gonna say no and he's like, yeah the one about how you shouldn't work on Wall Street.

287
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:42,295
Rym: and then I'm like no and I had slashed out open on my desktop because I just got into work and I was checking the news before I did my bullshit and That was the article that was just posted to slash that.

288
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:45,388
Rym: Mm-hmm I love slash shot, but it is slow.

289
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:56,020
Rym: the article basically makes the roundabout argument that You shouldn't let geeks and nerds and smart people work on Wall Street because smart people working on Wall Street is the problem.

290
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,191
Rym: It's taking all the smart people away from every other human endeavor.

291
00:15:59,271 --> 00:15:59,712
Scott: That's true.

292
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,639
Rym: Now this argument has been made a lot.

293
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,400
Rym: I see people like espousing it on blogs.

294
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,784
Rym: it gets debated a lot, but this is.

295
00:16:06,326 --> 00:16:12,848
Rym: this is kind of a really comprehensive article of all the reasons why this is harming our Society or technology.

296
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:13,974
Scott: it is harming the society.

297
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:15,180
Scott: It is harming technology.

298
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:21,500
Rym: Yeah But my question to all the people who complain about this is that would you turn down a job?

299
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:26,817
Rym: Where you would make more money than you currently pay in taxes to do less work than you're doing now.

300
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,820
Rym: Yep would you actually?

301
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:35,093
Scott: No, I wouldn't turn the job down I'd be like hells.

302
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:36,235
Scott: yeah show me the money.

303
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,480
Rym: that's why I work on Wall Street.

304
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,754
Rym: That's why everyone who works on Wall Street works on Wall Street.

305
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,040
Rym: I worked at IBM.

306
00:16:43,742 --> 00:16:45,549
Rym: I made less money there that I pay in taxes.

307
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,600
Rym: now literally I worked in hospitals in the Bronx.

308
00:16:48,741 --> 00:17:00,634
Rym: I did IT for hospitals like straight up like, you know The one of the places where technology could probably save more lives and help more people than any other Application in the world using IT to make health care more efficient and better.

309
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:08,733
Rym: I was surrounded there By some of the dumbest people I have ever had the displeasure of working with in my entire life.

310
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:14,280
Rym: Yeah, and I quit Entirely because I could not stand to be around those people anymore.

311
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:20,160
Scott: It's a. it's a you know, it's a perverse incentive and a chicken egg and a catch-22 all at the same time, right?

312
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,079
Scott: I like the smart people and the money are on Wall Street.

313
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:28,700
Scott: So smart people go there and smart people like to be around smart people and they like more money.

314
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,890
Scott: So they keep going to Wall Street.

315
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,120
Scott: So that bolsters Wall Street.

316
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,059
Scott: So now smart people are even more likely to go to Wall Street.

317
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:38,040
Rym: So, you know as Emily said you're welcome to not go to Wall Street.

318
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:39,024
Scott: You need to.

319
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:39,828
Scott: it has to be.

320
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:44,326
Scott: I mean, usually you don't want to go to the government solution But really there is no other solution.

321
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:48,020
Scott: The government has to rearrange the incentives to get the smart people to leave Wall Street.

322
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,044
Scott: There's no other way to do it.

323
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,127
Scott: Otherwise, you're just gonna go.

324
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:57,059
Rym: Scott you recall as Emily said so aptly some time ago The reason you make so much money is because you work for the money factory.

325
00:17:57,962 --> 00:18:00,658
Rym: I mean if I work for the candy factory, I get all the candy I can eat.

326
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:01,663
Scott: Yeah Why?

327
00:18:01,884 --> 00:18:05,398
Scott: if you ever if anyone needs a job go work at a bank why so the money is?

328
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:10,806
Rym: That was always my advice to punk kids who were like I need a job You'll be a bank teller.

329
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:19,419
Rym: you realize being a bank teller when you're 16 18 Cha-ching you look like 16 to 20 bucks an hour and you can steal if you're really really good.

330
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:23,050
Rym: Actually not that much cash changes.

331
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,882
Scott: hey, I'm saying you got to be really really good Scott.

332
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:31,620
Rym: you realize bank tellers in the modern era really don't touch that much money because who goes to a bank?

333
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:33,879
Scott: But old people you can go in the safe.

334
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:36,291
Rym: There's not that much money in that say.

335
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:39,771
Rym: Oh, but the safe deposit boxes Yeah, you're gonna break into one of those.

336
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,380
Scott: it gotta be really really good.

337
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,922
Scott: I'm not.

338
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:51,695
Scott: when I say really really I mean really really really like, you know, Ninja good I think you're better off Rob unrealistic movie action hero good not working there.

339
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:59,791
Rym: besides one of the pieces of advice My dad gave me before I went off to college was don't ever rob a bank because that's a federal crime Not a state crime and you don't want to go to a federal prison.

340
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:00,413
Scott: good advice.

341
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:04,411
Scott: other good advice Don't don't steal mail either.

342
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:05,600
Rym: It's not same reason.

343
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:08,780
Rym: I guess my argument my point here is that it's not just that all the money's there.

344
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:14,100
Rym: I mean doing the same IT work on Wall Street as opposed to at like to some small company.

345
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,538
Rym: You'll get paid like twice as much.

346
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:21,180
Rym: But a lot of people will work even when the money is not in their favor like they'll work for a place.

347
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,425
Rym: That's more fun rather than the money I'd work for a place.

348
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:27,499
Rym: that's more money because that's just the way the world is and I really like money.

349
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,473
Rym: But there's kind of this sublimation of smart people.

350
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:38,640
Rym: if you work with other smart people All of you collectively will draw more smart people into the organization because smart people like to work with other smart people.

351
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:41,439
Scott: Yep, this is why Google, you know is the way they are.

352
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:50,189
Rym: But if a company already has mostly average or stupid people it it's hard for them to get smart people or they Smart people and smart people in.

353
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:52,619
Scott: and if smart people show up they get pissed off and leave.

354
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:56,880
Scott: Yep, so and they're not gonna put the smart people in charge of themselves.

355
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,038
Scott: so say you've got 50 cuz they'll fire all the smart people and dumb people.

356
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:05,214
Rym: if Even one or two smart people leave all the rest are gonna evaporate away.

357
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:06,999
Rym: because now there's this critical mass of dumb.

358
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:12,380
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I mean beyond that a lot of these arguments are also kind of just spurious.

359
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:27,640
Rym: I mean I don't know if I personally would be making the world a better place if I'd studied mathematics Like everyone's trying to tell me to do instead of IT and if I was doing IT not on Wall Street I would have quit doing IT like three years ago because I just I was sick of that bullshit.

360
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,343
Rym: Well, there are.

361
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:29,248
Scott: I do sort.

362
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:30,454
Scott: that's the only thing I agree with.

363
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:41,236
Scott: it's like yes if we did You know, I can't blame anyone for going to finance, you know, I would probably go to finance too Except I work with sort of open source technologies which aren't popular in finance world.

364
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:43,263
Scott: if I worked with Oracle and shit I would be all that.

365
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:47,060
Scott: this is why if I was an Oracle Java guy, I'd be all over that finance.

366
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,555
Rym: Well, this is why you're like yeah using the new version of pylons to do something.

367
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:56,303
Rym: I'm like, yeah soap service As Exactly.

368
00:20:56,544 --> 00:20:59,940
Scott: if it wasn't for that I would totally do it too, but because I can't blame anyone for doing it.

369
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:10,873
Scott: But it is true I do totally agree that because the smart people are there attracting the smart people and because the money's there it is Hurting the rest of the the industries from improving right?

370
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,920
Scott: This is why hospitals are not so good.

371
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:22,980
Scott: This is why you know, I mean technology is fine But other things are not nearly as good as they could be because the smart people are all working in technology and finance.

372
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:25,871
Rym: but I think it's a kind of a cycle that started.

373
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:35,024
Scott: I think really what we need to do is you need to find a Way to get a perverse incentive to get the smart people to work in public service, then we could fix some shit Pretty much.

374
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:38,080
Rym: let him do what they want or pay them a lot of money.

375
00:21:38,392 --> 00:21:45,460
Scott: Yep Either one will get a ton of smart people to apply and also having smart people already in there without bullshit bureaucracy holding back.

376
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:48,663
Rym: I mean, I'll tell you what if I could be a computer teacher like in high schools Like just.

377
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:51,540
Rym: I will teach computer science to high school kids anyway.

378
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,191
Rym: I want they could pay me 40k a year and I would do it.

379
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,374
Rym: I need to summer off.

380
00:21:56,835 --> 00:22:00,346
Scott: Yeah, duh, duh, but To make the rest of the money.

381
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:00,989
Scott: I need to live.

382
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:03,240
Rym: Yeah, but I wouldn't even like question it.

383
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,731
Rym: But the factor is zoom.

384
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:05,760
Scott: it is too much bullshit.

385
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,266
Rym: The the barrier it's the.

386
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:12,466
Rym: it's weird to me that the barrier to entry for me and a senior it seems like with Otakon.

387
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:21,500
Scott: right every other convention is like cooperating with us to make the convention better and Otakon's like yeah, we don't want your free help making our convention more awesome.

388
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,119
Scott: It's like schools are the same way that my case school.

389
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:26,420
Scott: Pay me and let me be a computer teacher.

390
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:34,525
Scott: Only condition is that you let me teach computers the way I want and I won't I promise I won't you know hurt the children's And they'll be like, yeah.

391
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:37,940
Scott: No, it's like maybe why would you say no school?

392
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,604
Scott: You want to start a school?

393
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,408
Scott: It costs a lot of money.

394
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:41,574
Rym: Rym and Scott's school.

395
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:50,694
Scott: for the gifted Ever just ribbon Scott's, you know elementary technology school K through 12 K through one might be enough.

396
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:52,263
Rym: Yeah Got it.

397
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:52,845
Rym: Just got a show.

398
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:58,107
Rym: kid like a ti-85 and be like if you can make pong happen on this without looking at the You graduate it out.

399
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,700
Rym: You will be a wizard.

400
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:03,299
Scott: We got some ribbon Scott's wizards code.

401
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:08,519
Scott: Everyone gets a hat But you don't get the robe until you graduate only the hat.

402
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:21,420
Rym: So things of the day kind of old, but I forgot about this and I think it's just really clever and cute.

403
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:28,263
Rym: It's just a video of a girl talking about toy snakes and it's surprisingly I don't know.

404
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:31,094
Rym: There's something about the way she's like snake snake snake snake snake.

405
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:32,218
Rym: That's just really adorable.

406
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:32,720
Scott: I like it.

407
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,540
Rym: It's also really smart and cool raises a math question and doesn't answer it.

408
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:38,530
Rym: So you'll know what kind of person you are.

409
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:41,264
Rym: if you watch it and just think that was cute You're one kind of person.

410
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:45,546
Rym: if you watch it and then you start trying to solve the snake problem You're another kind of person.

411
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:47,337
Scott: Yeah, I started to.

412
00:23:47,357 --> 00:23:47,860
Scott: I was like man.

413
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,656
Scott: I wish I knew the solution to that problem, but I don't know the math.

414
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:51,340
Scott: I'm not even gonna try.

415
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,882
Scott: I'm Lazy.

416
00:23:54,942 --> 00:23:56,948
Scott: nerd snakes next next next next next thing.

417
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:01,744
Scott: So this is old game very old game named QWOP.

418
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:02,509
Scott: you may have heard of it.

419
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:03,415
Scott: It's a flash game.

420
00:24:03,455 --> 00:24:04,200
Scott: It's semi famous.

421
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,300
Rym: It's also known as Jesus motherfucking Christ.

422
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:06,582
Rym: Fuck.

423
00:24:06,622 --> 00:24:07,145
Rym: this game.

424
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:18,139
Scott: and basically the game if you haven't seen it right is a game where you use the four buttons on the keyboard QW o and P and the buttons control the calves and thighs on The left leg and the calves and thighs on the right leg.

425
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:26,638
Scott: now This runner and you're trying to dude break his neck repeated You're trying to run as far as you can using just these four buttons and the game as hard as balls and unintuitive.

426
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:27,140
Scott: now the guy.

427
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:29,417
Scott: That's not my thing of the day, even though maybe we'll link to it.

428
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,632
Scott: Anyway It's an old famous game.

429
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:39,017
Scott: You should have heard of This guy who made that game made a new game called gurp gi RP and the way this game works is it's.

430
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:40,240
Scott: it's actually better.

431
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,574
Scott: I think it's better than QWOP.

432
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:53,260
Scott: It's Just it still has that same frustrating keyboard aspect to it But you can make non-zero progress on your first try which makes it a little bit.

433
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,140
Scott: You know, it's more accessible than QWOP, but not by much.

434
00:24:57,461 --> 00:25:03,260
Rym: I enjoy the inaccessibility of QWOP because that's where the fun comes from playing it and swearing at it.

435
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,303
Scott: It's so weird.

436
00:25:04,343 --> 00:25:10,360
Scott: Like how could you make a game that was intentionally poorly designed yet that works in the game's favor?

437
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:17,800
Scott: I think it's like It's like if you were making perfume and you put poop smell in there and it became the most popular for view.

438
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:18,971
Rym: No, but look at what it's doing.

439
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:19,920
Rym: Look at the elegant message.

440
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,858
Rym: The game is actually a pretty good analogy of how you walk in terms of.

441
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:28,299
Rym: you know Muscles are contracting in this order and our brains just do that.

442
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:34,199
Rym: But when we have to think, you know calf thigh calf thigh, it's way harder to walk.

443
00:25:35,103 --> 00:25:43,518
Scott: Yeah, I don't think QWOP matches real thigh and calf But I think it's a suitable analogy for the kind of you're getting too deep into a shitty little game QWOP.

444
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:46,820
Rym: I think about what happens if I'm trying to raise and lower my arm.

445
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,505
Rym: How many muscles are working in concert?

446
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:53,580
Rym: and the abstract thought I'm thinking is simply make the arm go up and down in Scott's face.

447
00:25:53,903 --> 00:25:55,337
Scott: All right, you're thinking too hard about this.

448
00:25:57,402 --> 00:25:58,729
Rym: All right, we got a meta moment.

449
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:00,680
Rym: very briefly we were at the penny arcade expo.

450
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:10,599
Rym: We read zinc icon if you wanted to see our panels from the penny arcade expo And you were not able to either because the room was full or because you were it wasn't full.

451
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:12,947
Scott: The room was almost full.

452
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:15,880
Rym: It was full on this Sunday for one of them, but it wasn't full on Friday.

453
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,233
Scott: I wasn't a hundred percent full is 99% full.

454
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:19,360
Scott: You could have walked in and sat down.

455
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,005
Rym: Well, they shut the door.

456
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:21,034
Rym: So no one was gonna come in.

457
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:21,720
Scott: Anyway, that's true.

458
00:26:21,983 --> 00:26:23,400
Rym: The room was pretty much full.

459
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,559
Rym: But basically if you couldn't get into the panel for whatever reason a lot of people, you know Don't go to PAX because they're they're dumb.

460
00:26:29,564 --> 00:26:35,706
Rym: Well, we did all of our panels at PAX and Through the power of video.

461
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:39,220
Rym: I have put one of them on YouTube and I will try to put the other two on YouTube.

462
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,023
Rym: Cuz I have time.

463
00:26:40,043 --> 00:26:55,080
Scott: I don't know if we're gonna do every panel ever cuz I want people to go to the conventions Actually have something to see if we because we repeat panels a lot So I'd like to mostly put up retired panels or panels are probably not gonna do again But panels that are brand new probably don't want to put them on YouTube.

464
00:26:55,401 --> 00:27:07,320
Rym: At the same time it'll be good because we have this problem at conventions where we'll do a panel and have the people who Show up or people who already know who we are and half of them have already seen that panel at another con.

465
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:08,749
Scott: Then why are they coming to that panel?

466
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:10,803
Rym: I don't know they but they do Hopefully.

467
00:27:10,823 --> 00:27:14,100
Scott: what we can do though is if we put things on YouTube, then we'll be forced to come up with new panels.

468
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,967
Scott: But we need new panels.

469
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:17,513
Rym: We have a lot of new panels.

470
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,718
Rym: We just haven't done them anywhere yet.

471
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:19,220
Scott: We need more.

472
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:21,520
Rym: I mean look we had almost all new panels for PAX East.

473
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:22,243
Scott: Yeah, we get.

474
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:23,487
Scott: we get a lot of new conventions.

475
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:28,063
Rym: all of our new all of our anime Boston panels are effectively new because we Only tested them once.

476
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:31,253
Rym: a zinc icon a ConnectiCon ConnectiCon a zinc icon.

477
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:32,056
Rym: Thank I can.

478
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:36,776
Scott: we trotted out the old Classics and so they asked us to do we got to do the panels.

479
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:38,506
Scott: They ask yeah We can't you know.

480
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:43,080
Scott: just tell them these are the panels We're doing because they then they might just reject all that you know.

481
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,656
Scott: We suggest these are the three new ones that we're only doing these three the big.

482
00:27:46,676 --> 00:27:47,540
Scott: we don't want any of those three.

483
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:48,768
Scott: We want these old three.

484
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:50,419
Scott: We don't want to do the old three.

485
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:51,798
Scott: Well, we're not doing anything.

486
00:27:52,382 --> 00:27:56,258
Rym: But anyway all that aside the book club book as soon as Scott finishes reading it.

487
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:59,639
Scott: I read one I still haven't read what Jack who's hyperspace?

488
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,240
Rym: I'll start reading it today And we will be at anime Boston doing our usual panels.

489
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:11,720
Scott: So let's do the book club book definitely a week from Thursday on that Thursday the next Thursday episode.

490
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:19,342
Rym: So we've realized and we did some shows on topics related to this like remember we did that show on like NTP and all those Different things.

491
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:31,448
Rym: but it's coming to my attention more and more that many many people who claim to be IT people or claim to know about technology Don't know how to administer Servers well at all.

492
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:34,860
Scott: I mean system administration is sort of a dying thing, right?

493
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,136
Scott: Which is a problem because it's like in the olden days system administration was like a legit.

494
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:41,200
Scott: It was a legit deal.

495
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,432
Scott: You needed people to administer systems, right.

496
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:44,720
Scott: people who you know?

497
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,960
Scott: Knew how to use a server because using a server was different than using a regular computer, right?

498
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,859
Scott: It was like especially if you had mainframes and things.

499
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:56,760
Scott: Yeah, it's like you needed programmers to write the software that went on the mainframes.

500
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,500
Rym: Then you also kind of like an engineer on a train who sits there and pulls the levers and makes the software go.

501
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,887
Scott: Yeah, but it's not just people using to use that.

502
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:08,820
Scott: There's the software that you're actually you know, there's like two different users, right?

503
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:23,164
Scott: There's the person who you know takes this software say Microsoft Word right and produces documents but there's also a Separate person who has to install Microsoft Word and make sure it keeps running and keep it up to date and all those sorts of Things that you might think.

504
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:26,280
Scott: well, that's the same person as the user right especially on a home computer.

505
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:30,142
Scott: but in a company when you've got a mainframe it's like all right.

506
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:32,653
Scott: who installs and configures exchange right?

507
00:29:32,713 --> 00:29:37,860
Scott: a programmer made exchange and A user opens outlook and uses exchange.

508
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:51,729
Scott: But some guy has to install a copy of Windows Server install exchange configure exchange Set all the SMTP settings and all those things and that is the administrator and it's a job that was needed a great deal Especially in the windows and mainframe days.

509
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,956
Rym: So I will argue that it is still needed.

510
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:55,040
Rym: It is still needed.

511
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:59,775
Scott: It is just needed less and in cases where it is still done.

512
00:29:59,796 --> 00:30:02,766
Rym: It is done often Saying it's needed less now.

513
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:15,680
Rym: I would agree with you in that technologies made it a lot easier to run a server But at the same time that in assumes that the people who originally set up any given server Set it up with even a reasonable degree of cop.

514
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:24,560
Scott: Well, no, it's what I'm saying is needed less not because it's it's not needed But it's because there are so many services out there that basically outsource this, right?

515
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,101
Scott: So it's centralized and there are many tools that allow it to be sort of the scale of it Right.

516
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,232
Scott: So, you know, for example, you'll have something like Amazon.

517
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:35,680
Scott: So you just click a button and you get a new server.

518
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:53,920
Scott: You didn't need another administrator to do this because there's like a few administrators at Amazon that can administer a lot more systems per administrator and with tools like puppy and all these other things and You know a lot of times if you have some software and you want to get it running on a server You know, you can get like a managed hosting.

519
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:56,109
Scott: So there's one administrator who would?

520
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:58,539
Scott: normally you would need one administrator per host.

521
00:30:58,921 --> 00:31:08,154
Scott: You know purse first system, but now one guy can administer so many systems at a data center Especially with cloud services you need less administrators.

522
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:19,608
Rym: It doesn't mean that you don't need any only from the perspective though primarily of consumers or small companies because anywhere else there's a ton of in-house servers where there are Administrators doing physical servers and data centers.

523
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:24,866
Scott: Yes, but I'm just saying overall in the world the number of administrators We need is fewer.

524
00:31:24,886 --> 00:31:25,911
Rym: I don't think it is.

525
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,940
Rym: I think it's more because there's far more computers.

526
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:31,980
Rym: There are more computers Yes, and also those computers many of them.

527
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:54,411
Rym: The only reason we have fewer administrators is because in my experience pretty much every server I've ever run into out in the wild world like not at the place I work now and but like when I worked say at IBM and I would be tasked with hey There's this server and the guy who was maintaining it and you know just system administering it Retired see what it needs and take care of it.

528
00:31:54,632 --> 00:31:56,036
Scott: And well, is it running right now?

529
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:57,260
Rym: Yeah, it needs nothing.

530
00:31:57,983 --> 00:32:04,518
Rym: Yeah, so I log into it to see you know, what's up and it's a disaster and eventually it fails And there's almost no way to get it going again.

531
00:32:05,864 --> 00:32:09,207
Rym: just I mean and there's a million different topics we could get into.

532
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:19,268
Rym: but I really want to focus tonight just on logging because I think most people who have computers don't actually Really understand what logs are.

533
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:20,112
Rym: no, not at all.

534
00:32:20,132 --> 00:32:20,976
Rym: Don't use them.

535
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:23,586
Scott: Don't interact Me even me.

536
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:32,360
Scott: I didn't really get logs until like the late 90s early 2000s You know just because I was using like DAW systems and Windows systems where logs don't really sort of exist.

537
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:39,708
Scott: But I knew that logs were a thing because if you watched any sort of movies of hacking they would talk about logs and removing Yourself from the law.

538
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,340
Rym: I saw him in the logs.

539
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,860
Scott: Yeah, but it's like I never saw actual logs or worked with them until much later.

540
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:48,492
Scott: But now I know all about logs.

541
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:59,340
Rym: Yeah, but I don't think most people do I mean, I would say that nine times out of ten whenever there's a problem like a server just won't boot or there's a problem Just look at our log messages and you'll see exactly what happened.

542
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,011
Rym: Like oh the oom killer went amok because you used up all your memory.

543
00:33:03,252 --> 00:33:07,622
Rym: Yep, or something like just painfully just Blunderingly obvious.

544
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:15,407
Rym: but yet most of the IT people I've run into out there don't actually even know that there's a bar log Or even that what bar is.

545
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:16,010
Rym: well, really?

546
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,036
Scott: That's I mean like.

547
00:33:17,237 --> 00:33:18,844
Scott: I know The people.

548
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:21,254
Scott: I know they know there are logs and they know to look at them.

549
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:25,773
Scott: but often the logs are Misconfigured or they don't know which log to look in.

550
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:30,686
Scott: or even if they find the log to look in They don't know how to read the log So they can't understand what they found.

551
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:34,980
Scott: or or they'll see something that's irrelevant and think it's relevant just because it's an error message.

552
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,540
Rym: Yeah, well people the simple thing about logs is kind of like rims pro tip number one But it's a legit pro tip not an internet ironic pro tip.

553
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:50,006
Rym: If you have if you're diagnosing a problem in an unfamiliar environment and in the logs you see an error And you think it's related to your problem.

554
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:54,619
Rym: Look at the previous few weeks logs and see how commonly that error occurs.

555
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:57,626
Rym: Because you're gonna in var log secure.

556
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:01,158
Rym: You're probably gonna see a whole bunch of bullshit even on a well running server.

557
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:04,990
Rym: Yep Plenty of it but like simple things like that.

558
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:10,469
Rym: I don't think people know and I think back to our IT They didn't teach us shit about logs.

559
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:17,219
Rym: No, they didn't teach anyone like oh, you know Our log messages and the terminal server syslog how to use it this log NG.

560
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,565
Rym: Yeah, I use our syslog.

561
00:34:19,585 --> 00:34:24,199
Scott: I use this network, you know, what's it called centralization of logging?

562
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,203
Rym: Well, you're remotely you have log rotating Never mind.

563
00:34:27,243 --> 00:34:28,467
Rym: No one monitors their logs.

564
00:34:28,828 --> 00:34:31,175
Scott: Oh hell no we do and it's really simple.

565
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:41,360
Rym: just run some sort of like Process that just reads your logs in semi real time and you know regular expression wise pull out errors and send them to someone.

566
00:34:41,701 --> 00:34:43,527
Rym: Yep, and yet no one even does that.

567
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:50,491
Rym: Yeah, I think my primary blame really is gonna fall on Windows Mmm, because most people learn computers through Windows.

568
00:34:50,831 --> 00:34:56,699
Rym: Yeah, and like I said, I've never in my life Successfully diagnosed a problem by looking at the Windows Event Manager.

569
00:34:57,341 --> 00:34:58,707
Scott: Okay, so that's the one thing.

570
00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:01,760
Scott: all systems that aren't Windows pretty much, right?

571
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,694
Scott: They keep logs in text files and you can just look at the text files.

572
00:35:05,714 --> 00:35:15,020
Scott: and there are various tools you can use To parse these text files and Scan them and get information out of them and you know very easy and standard ways that always work.

573
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,190
Scott: But in Windows all the logs are in this weird GUI.

574
00:35:18,571 --> 00:35:21,500
Scott: It's really hard to figure out and is non obvious.

575
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:25,251
Scott: Well pretty much only Windows experts can go in there and get it.

576
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:29,064
Rym: you realize there is a secret land of real logging in Windows Really?

577
00:35:29,124 --> 00:35:30,311
Rym: There's the kernel logs.

578
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:31,297
Scott: How do you get there?

579
00:35:31,438 --> 00:35:34,900
Rym: So I Acquired this from a vendor a long time ago.

580
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:41,000
Rym: I have it at work and it's this debug viewer that basically shows you the real-time output of the Windows kernel console.

581
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:45,354
Rym: Okay, so it's basically the system dot out or the kind of like.

582
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:51,900
Rym: I'm trying to think of a good analogy for Linux Like, you know when you write a crappy program or you see a crappy service that just spit shit out into the console.

583
00:35:52,151 --> 00:36:01,400
Rym: Yeah So ever log into a server is root and you see just all this crap flooding your screen Interrupting your commands because someone didn't set up this log only on a really old shitty system.

584
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:03,987
Rym: well Windows has something like that.

585
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:04,469
Rym: that's hidden.

586
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:14,483
Rym: so you run a capture basically of the kernel like the debug view logs of Windows and you can see just everything that's flying by and A lot of Windows services.

587
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:23,797
Rym: actually you can configure them to log different log levels to that and then capture that And then your server crashes because the program that reads is a piece of shit.

588
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:24,300
Scott: That's right.

589
00:36:25,962 --> 00:36:27,188
Scott: But yeah, let's let's talk about.

590
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:29,560
Scott: let's do some topics in in logging, right?

591
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:36,580
Scott: So let's let's first tell us about log rotating because Pete this is something that's done often day today automatically, right?

592
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:42,076
Scott: So if you install an Ubuntu system or Fedora system all the log rotation is already pre-configured.

593
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:42,959
Scott: So, you know, that's good.

594
00:36:42,979 --> 00:36:50,560
Rym: in one way I really agree with desktop Linux and even like low-level servers intelligent defaults are better than good customizability any day.

595
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:54,359
Rym: Yeah, but wait, I just said that the iPhone is the best phone anyway.

596
00:36:55,661 --> 00:37:17,060
Rym: anyway, the problem with that is if Someone working for say a financial institution or someone working in any industry where there's regulation like telecoms there are legal requirements for certain kinds of logs and records being kept for certain numbers of years and If you just build a default Ubuntu server, you're not gonna have two years worth of your logs.

597
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:23,720
Scott: No, see basically what the deal with log rotating is this you got logs So everything that happens on the computer is being written down, right?

598
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:28,238
Scott: It's like a shit, you know logs go all the way back, you know to ship's logs.

599
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:35,129
Rym: on boats perhaps even older than that you basically perhaps got All the records we have of the Sumerian language.

600
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,538
Rym: are logs of grain shipments being received.

601
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:46,272
Scott: Yeah, right It's like, you know, someone just writes down everything that happens well on a computer Which has such incredible power and is doing a lot of work and isn't running Windows.

602
00:37:46,492 --> 00:37:54,640
Scott: a lot of things happen all the time Which means the log gets really big and which means the log is going to eat up all your hard drive space.

603
00:37:54,941 --> 00:38:00,319
Scott: Eventually, and if you have a lot, you know if the sudden bursts of activity You could have trouble if your hard drive gets full.

604
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:05,300
Scott: Which is why number one you always want to keep your logs on a separate partition from everything else.

605
00:38:05,622 --> 00:38:11,508
Scott: So worst-case scenario if that fills up and you're out of disk space You won't run out of disk space for your actual application.

606
00:38:11,528 --> 00:38:12,350
Scott: You have downtime.

607
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,315
Scott: You only fail to log.

608
00:38:14,456 --> 00:38:15,739
Rym: Let's zoom out a little bit.

609
00:38:16,522 --> 00:38:18,909
Rym: Really, you know the Linux file system.

610
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:19,591
Rym: kids out there like.

611
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,300
Rym: there's VAR and all those different places.

612
00:38:22,642 --> 00:38:28,668
Rym: I keep saying VAR because VAR log is where you should log everything Yep And there's VAR temp and all the different places under VAR.

613
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:32,099
Rym: VAR is the shit that changes that you don't necessarily care about.

614
00:38:32,782 --> 00:38:41,317
Rym: VAR is where you VAR itself should be on a separate partition because VAR is the most likely thing to fill up other than temp Yep, and you don't want that to hose your whole server.

615
00:38:41,397 --> 00:38:44,030
Rym: Nope Also, you know log rotation.

616
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,960
Rym: I mean there's different ways to rotate logs circular rotation.

617
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,408
Rym: You've got one file that just kind of gets read.

618
00:38:49,448 --> 00:38:53,120
Rym: the oldest records in it get overwritten as newer records come in.

619
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,490
Scott: Well, that's a that's a ring log.

620
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,777
Scott: Oh, yeah ring log Because it writes you write in a ring.

621
00:38:58,594 --> 00:38:59,482
Scott: But yeah basically log.

622
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:11,160
Scott: the idea of log rotation is that when the log gets too big either by you judging by how big it is or Judging by how long it's been since you last rotated you can either like zip up the logs and start a fresh blank one.

623
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:16,780
Scott: You know, just maybe archive logs or delete old logs in according to some schedule.

624
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:19,939
Scott: Right such that your hard drive space won't fill up.

625
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:23,578
Scott: But you'll have enough backlog that you can solve problems and look things up.

626
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:34,700
Rym: Yeah, just rotate them such that you know We have a different file for every day - so say there's a problem and I don't have one 400 terabyte log file from the last hundred years to grep through.

627
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:38,356
Rym: Instead I can look at the log for the day the problem happened.

628
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:38,819
Scott: Yep

629
00:39:39,582 --> 00:39:59,759
Rym: Now speaking of the size of the logs, I mean, you know, it sounds like it'd be complex like alright Maybe I'll write a little script that'll say like every day if the logs more than 10 megabytes I should it turns out that in Unix and Linux Anything that anyone who administered servers back in the day would have to do more than once is already built in?

630
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:03,540
Scott: Yeah this nowadays usually there's an automatic log rotator.

631
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:09,860
Scott: You can look in like Etsy log rotate dot D and there'll be configuration files that automatically set up log rotator.

632
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:17,980
Rym: anything you would think you would want to do with logs is already built into any Linux computer and people just don't realize it because It's handled automatically by the distribution.

633
00:40:18,902 --> 00:40:21,580
Scott: But if you're an administrator, you actually need to look at that.

634
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,644
Scott: You can't just let the.

635
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:27,000
Scott: you know, the even if you're using Ubuntu the defaults might work for you, which would be fine.

636
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:36,279
Scott: But you better check them at least to make sure that they're working for you and complying You know with whatever regulations you have and also with whatever you want, you know, maybe you want something different.

637
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:39,306
Rym: So when you're trying to you know Move on to another topic.

638
00:40:39,326 --> 00:40:43,023
Rym: when you're actually trying to debug a problem in the logs, like there's a problem I'm going to look into logs.

639
00:40:43,404 --> 00:40:43,504
Rym: Hmm.

640
00:40:44,086 --> 00:40:47,535
Rym: You're really like knowing your way around Linux as in.

641
00:40:47,796 --> 00:40:53,195
Rym: you know tail head Grab rap less said less not so much more.

642
00:40:53,255 --> 00:40:54,640
Scott: a lot a lot of people right?

643
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,100
Scott: I always see this mistake all the time.

644
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,360
Scott: They try to open a log file in their text editor and then it crashes because it loads the entire log file into memory.

645
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:14,858
Scott: They don't realize that you need to use, you know, some sort of pager like less which is the other preferred pager But you can use more if you want which will allow you to easily look at a gigantic text file without eating up all the memory on the machine and crushing you.

646
00:41:14,998 --> 00:41:18,880
Rym: or Grap, crap is one of the most powerful tools in your tools.

647
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,869
Scott: Yeah, but you don't know grab and regular expressions.

648
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:29,000
Scott: You can't be a system administrator of Unix is regular Expressions are literally like the currency of what I was hiring system administrators.

649
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:32,174
Scott: The first questions I would ask them in the interview would be regular expression related.

650
00:41:32,214 --> 00:41:33,500
Scott: if they didn't know I just like goodbye.

651
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:35,290
Rym: That's pretty much how I interview people.

652
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:36,900
Rym: Yeah, I asked him.

653
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,818
Rym: So if the question I always ask is so say you're troubleshooting a problem All right

654
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,969
Scott: And let's see if I can get this question right and you've

655
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:54,018
Rym: got to look through the log files like say it's an Apache problem Someone's like some module isn't working right or something now, of course I'm watching them to see if their eyes glaze over when I say Apache module you know, you got to watch for these things.

656
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:59,559
Rym: but So a problem happened the other day and you know, the guy's username and the IP came from.

657
00:42:00,323 --> 00:42:02,133
Rym: How would you go about finding out what the problem was?

658
00:42:02,173 --> 00:42:03,400
Rym: Like what would be your steps?

659
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,446
Scott: I know is I know his username.

660
00:42:05,466 --> 00:42:06,390
Rym: I know his username.

661
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,755
Scott: I could grab the logs.

662
00:42:07,856 --> 00:42:10,929
Rym: All right, you already win you You're already past.

663
00:42:11,009 --> 00:42:11,472
Scott: I could just do.

664
00:42:11,533 --> 00:42:23,861
Rym: grab space username space file that is slash borrow slash log slash Apache slash access and you already know more than most people I've ever Interviewed for any position at any company I've ever worked for Sad.

665
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:27,350
Rym: so then the follow-on is with Greg because you know people.

666
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:29,295
Rym: usually they can use Greg kind of.

667
00:42:29,315 --> 00:42:32,005
Rym: hopefully I would say Yeah, they can't.

668
00:42:32,045 --> 00:42:34,860
Scott: they can't actually get for a regular expression, but they can grab for something.

669
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,288
Scott: See, the thing is you got to be really good.

670
00:42:37,328 --> 00:42:40,840
Scott: You're like me, but you can use find and xargs and grab together.

671
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:46,210
Rym: That's when you get hired and a raise, you know I never ever need to use find or xargs.

672
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,100
Scott: really because what if you want to grab all the files?

673
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,053
Scott: Recursively in a directory to have the same extension and you want to grep all of them.

674
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:55,918
Rym: Uh, that's trivial.

675
00:42:55,978 --> 00:42:56,480
Scott: How do you do it?

676
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:58,000
Rym: I do it from the command line.

677
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:05,320
Rym: I usually do something like grep my giant regular expression and then I put you know, the file name dot star.

678
00:43:06,142 --> 00:43:12,519
Scott: But what if you want to do for example all HTML files recursively from the current folder grep start on HTML.

679
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:13,483
Scott: That doesn't work That's not.

680
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:14,107
Scott: that's not gonna do.

681
00:43:14,188 --> 00:43:15,699
Rym: actually I set up my shell to where that does work.

682
00:43:16,963 --> 00:43:22,939
Scott: What you would do is you to find dot dash Start HTML pipe, you know, sorry space grab, you know

683
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:29,781
Rym: I do find something when there are too many files to do a listing When there are too many files to be arguments I'll

684
00:43:29,821 --> 00:43:34,578
Scott: have to show you the secrets of fine because clearly I'm in more advanced in the Unix department than you are

685
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,895
Rym: because I've set Up my system to where that's unnecessary.

686
00:43:36,935 --> 00:43:50,589
Rym: Yeah I have because all my log files are name of demon Dates all in one line dot and then they roll over like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 up to like You know nine hundred a thousand ten thousand whatever every day.

687
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,037
Scott: What do you want to look at every Monday?

688
00:43:53,057 --> 00:43:56,854
Rym: Oh I never need to look at a previous day's logs for something like that.

689
00:43:56,894 --> 00:43:58,160
Rym: That's that's a whole different.

690
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:58,842
Rym: We don't keep my.

691
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:00,809
Scott: I'm just saying there's reasons to do things like that.

692
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,720
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying I'm saying my daily work.

693
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,100
Rym: I don't need to do that.

694
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:12,300
Scott: I do that quite often usually because I'll have a big code base and I'll for example want to look for a variable but I know it's not gonna be an HTML files only Python files.

695
00:44:12,642 --> 00:44:15,095
Scott: So I'll grep only the py files, but recursively.

696
00:44:15,577 --> 00:44:16,040
Scott: I did a lot.

697
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:18,220
Scott: So usually I know why I accept aliases for that.

698
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:24,660
Rym: Usually I know what pile of problems in but I'm doing something more like trace a particular like execution or thread.

699
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:31,558
Scott: I'll do something like I'm removing functionality from an application So I need to find every place that that functionality is used to remove it.

700
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:41,440
Rym: I have more things like figure out why something happened to an order with this ID And I grew up through the logs for that ID and then I pieced together the story of that order through the logs.

701
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:44,051
Rym: Mm-hmm sort matters a lot actually for that.

702
00:44:44,111 --> 00:44:46,260
Scott: Yeah, you got to use sort you ever use cut and paste.

703
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:50,760
Rym: Oh my god, he's cut all the time because we use all your logs are delimited properly.

704
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,188
Rym: They're delimited to it to an insane degree.

705
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:53,770
Scott: That's good.

706
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:54,673
Scott: Very good.

707
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,980
Rym: Yeah, let's talk about writing log files.

708
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,985
Rym: Cuz people don't think about that.

709
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,740
Rym: you think sysadmins don't know what to do with logs.

710
00:45:01,023 --> 00:45:02,620
Rym: Developers don't know what to do with fucking law.

711
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:11,000
Scott: Yeah, when you write a log, right you got to remember this is gonna be read by someone But that someone is gonna be using the UNIX tools to read it to read it more easily.

712
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,320
Rym: You can't just be like yeah If my code runs into an exception just write the exception to the logs like this multi-line monster.

713
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:23,500
Rym: No My log files are log channel space time and date and all other that stuff space like name of demon.

714
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:29,100
Scott: You need to have a standard format and if possible a standard format for every log regardless of what it is.

715
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,107
Scott: Yep, that way it's easy for somebody to you know easily parse that log to find what they're looking for.

716
00:45:34,147 --> 00:45:41,474
Scott: if every log file is a different format and if the format isn't consistent then It's like it's such a pain in the ass to find anything in it because it's like.

717
00:45:41,494 --> 00:45:43,120
Scott: I want to find everything with the date.

718
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,153
Scott: Well half the things in this log file don't even have a date.

719
00:45:45,334 --> 00:45:46,200
Rym: or what about log levels?

720
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:49,091
Rym: I want to find all the actual problems.

721
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:49,994
Scott: I want to find everything.

722
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:50,957
Scott: that's an error, but nothing.

723
00:45:50,978 --> 00:45:51,660
Scott: that's a warning.

724
00:45:51,984 --> 00:45:56,180
Scott: But I still want to log the warnings So they might want to see them another time, but I only want to see the errors right now.

725
00:45:56,308 --> 00:46:02,274
Scott: Yeah If the word error isn't there in a way that I can easily grep for it Then I'm that's gonna become impossible to do.

726
00:46:02,475 --> 00:46:11,240
Rym: working with shitty logs I will often just be like a case insensitive grep for the word error warning Problem fatal and I'll just see what I find.

727
00:46:13,262 --> 00:46:20,540
Rym: The best way to do it is actually have defined log channels Or like you can say it to Jesus because you want it to be at the front of each line.

728
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:25,300
Rym: So you can do the front based grepping which is a huge performance benefit.

729
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:31,631
Scott: Another thing that you can do if you're a really good system administrator Right and you have a shitty log file or even a good log file.

730
00:46:31,912 --> 00:46:34,931
Scott: You can whip out the heavy guns Set an awk.

731
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:40,694
Scott: Oh man If you get an awk is like, you know said is like an m16 but awk is like a minigun.

732
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:42,780
Rym: awk is like the whole hog.

733
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:45,973
Scott: Yeah, if you can use awk then you you have won.

734
00:46:45,994 --> 00:46:49,888
Rym: you win the game, you know I'll admit is I don't use awk often enough to like.

735
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:53,140
Scott: I haven't used awk since RIT, but I know it's there.

736
00:46:53,261 --> 00:46:54,550
Rym: Yep, I got a look at a reference.

737
00:46:54,611 --> 00:47:00,199
Scott: when I use awk most of the time It's like the bomb you keep in the closet and you don't use it because you never need to actually use a bomb.

738
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:02,035
Rym: you can Always get by with a hand class.

739
00:47:02,075 --> 00:47:05,654
Rym: at RIT That was literally the whole first half of the class was said at awk.

740
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:06,498
Scott: I took that class.

741
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:07,825
Rym: Yep They gave you that book.

742
00:47:07,845 --> 00:47:09,755
Rym: That was like a little said book and then a big awk book.

743
00:47:09,835 --> 00:47:21,259
Scott: Yeah But I mean I've heard stories of like guys teaching AI Programming classes using awk and it actually was better than lists and I could believe it.

744
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:30,360
Rym: yeah, because awk is really good at taking a text file that has stuff in it and Processing that text into another form that is surprisingly readable.

745
00:47:30,425 --> 00:47:35,718
Scott: Yeah basically the way awk works is you create an awk script and an awk script is basically a list of regular expressions.

746
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,160
Scott: and What to do if one of those regular expressions is matched?

747
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:44,675
Rym: So if I find fatal warning or error in this in the first end characters of any given line do this.

748
00:47:44,876 --> 00:47:51,360
Rym: then take these four Columns delimited by these two different sets of delimiters and put them in this database, right?

749
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:58,532
Scott: Hey basically You can process huge amounts of text in Incredibly powerful ways and incredibly short amounts of time.

750
00:47:58,592 --> 00:48:02,819
Rym: if you have awk and regular expression skills You can even do simple stuff like it like.

751
00:48:03,801 --> 00:48:08,857
Rym: It's weird that I'll often use awk instead of cut just because I have the awk syntax at my head more quickly.

752
00:48:08,877 --> 00:48:09,298
Rym: Mm-hmm.

753
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:15,440
Rym: But log levels are really really important and most people at best they use log for J, which is okay

754
00:48:15,882 --> 00:48:16,062
Scott: Yeah,

755
00:48:16,464 --> 00:48:27,739
Rym: but really like the way I would do it is have like a two or three digit number That's the beginning of every file no matter what and just define for your developers Like channel one is for fatal errors anything fatal.

756
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:34,700
Rym: Channel 18 is the super debug logs log fucking everything there because you're gonna have a log mask.

757
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,779
Rym: You're not gonna write the debug logs all the time.

758
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:42,500
Rym: You only write the debug logs if there's a problem that needs serious fixing like there's some crazy logic bug.

759
00:48:42,647 --> 00:48:50,666
Rym: All right well the developers turn up the debug log which kills the performance and they run the program and it logs every single like memory statement and Then they go through and figure out what happened.

760
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,415
Rym: Yeah, you don't want to log that every day.

761
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,500
Rym: every day you log.

762
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,319
Rym: I don't know the fatals the warnings the errors maybe the like messages.

763
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,480
Scott: hmm Yeah, anyway, let's let's let's talk about some other logging topics, right?

764
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:10,286
Scott: So one thing that very few people to that I actually think is sort of a good idea is do log Centralization right very important.

765
00:49:10,788 --> 00:49:13,980
Scott: a lot of times you got a whole bunch of servers in your data center or whatever, right?

766
00:49:14,241 --> 00:49:16,699
Scott: And they all have logs and something happens.

767
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,763
Scott: But really all these.

768
00:49:17,964 --> 00:49:23,220
Scott: there's a bunch of physical servers, but they're really actually one system working in concert.

769
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,260
Rym: You shouldn't need to log into the actual system that had a problem to diagnose the problem.

770
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:31,120
Scott: Yeah, it's like you got a log into all these different systems now to figure out where the problem was.

771
00:49:31,281 --> 00:49:31,863
Scott: And what if?

772
00:49:31,983 --> 00:49:32,184
Rym: what?

773
00:49:32,305 --> 00:49:41,239
Rym: if say I've got a system that takes like information about a chip I'm building and it's on one server and it processes that and then sends it to another server.

774
00:49:42,321 --> 00:49:43,687
Rym: Yeah, and then there's a problem there.

775
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,133
Rym: now I get a log into both servers.

776
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:46,960
Rym: look at these two separate sets of log files.

777
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:55,820
Scott: Right what you can do and it's never configured by default But most modern systems you can configure logs to be sent over the network and logged in a central locations.

778
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,642
Scott: You can have a computer.

779
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:58,988
Scott: that is the log computer and every.

780
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:03,540
Scott: every other computer sends its logs to to that one computer.

781
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:11,144
Scott: And now you can read the logs for every system in your system in one place your dog System in your system.

782
00:50:11,164 --> 00:50:12,389
Scott: I logged your logs now.

783
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:13,272
Rym: Let's go one step further.

784
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:15,119
Rym: I mean, that's really important and no one does it.

785
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,407
Scott: but What if the network goes down?

786
00:50:17,427 --> 00:50:19,920
Rym: is actually well, you've got to set up something for that.

787
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,079
Rym: You gotta make sure your program's not gonna lock on IO.

788
00:50:22,882 --> 00:50:27,760
Scott: And yeah, you also got to make sure that you always have logs no matter, you know, how many systems go down.

789
00:50:28,121 --> 00:50:32,795
Rym: Yep, but even worse than that is alright, so I'm logging centrally, but how do I know there's a problem?

790
00:50:33,056 --> 00:50:34,560
Rym: fucking nobody monitors?

791
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:53,000
Rym: their logs worth a goddamn Mmm, and I don't know why it is Trivial to monitor logs if you've even if your logs are shitty just have a process run everything through a stream editor or Have a grip that runs every five minutes on your log directory and just sends every warning to in an email.

792
00:50:53,281 --> 00:50:54,648
Scott: Yeah, I mean a lot of times, you know.

793
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:58,547
Scott: these days for example, right front-row crew calm There's an error on front-row crew calm.

794
00:50:58,788 --> 00:51:01,820
Scott: then the application itself sends me the email, right?

795
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,745
Scott: I don't need to grab the logs for that to happen But there are.

796
00:51:05,926 --> 00:51:09,016
Scott: there are a lot of old systems that do not do this.

797
00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:11,142
Scott: they do not have this functionality You know.

798
00:51:11,303 --> 00:51:11,664
Rym: or what?

799
00:51:11,704 --> 00:51:16,500
Rym: if the system dies before it can send like say it like crashes hard as some crazy exception.

800
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:27,140
Scott: Well if the log was centralized and that log managed to escape the computer and to a place and that Centralized log server had a monitor you would get an email actually about that completely failed system.

801
00:51:27,482 --> 00:51:31,240
Scott: Now that's a lot better chance than you're gonna get from the failed system sending an email on its own.

802
00:51:31,601 --> 00:51:32,745
Rym: Now the other problem is that you could.

803
00:51:32,765 --> 00:51:35,153
Rym: it's really hard to tailor that sort of monitoring.

804
00:51:35,514 --> 00:51:35,755
Rym: if you're.

805
00:51:35,855 --> 00:51:43,080
Rym: if you send too many things from your logs via email Then you're gonna start ignoring the emails because you know, they're meaningless and you're not gonna respond to things that quickly.

806
00:51:44,261 --> 00:51:44,722
Scott: Very true.

807
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:48,171
Rym: If you don't send enough then you get them.

808
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:49,614
Rym: you get an email servers down.

809
00:51:49,634 --> 00:51:50,577
Rym: You're like, okay great.

810
00:51:50,978 --> 00:51:51,820
Rym: What caused that?

811
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,959
Rym: So you've got to have and really my advice is to use SNMP, which is something nobody knows.

812
00:51:58,924 --> 00:52:01,419
Scott: Some people know it but not enough people usually right.

813
00:52:01,821 --> 00:52:05,140
Scott: It's the thing that you you outsourced and you're using it, but you don't realize it.

814
00:52:05,401 --> 00:52:06,103
Rym: But what like?

815
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:10,560
Scott: you'll log into Amazon and you'll pay extra to get cloudwatch which it monitors your servers.

816
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:16,079
Scott: You see all your CPU usage graphs for all your servers on Amazon, but you don't realize they're using SNMP to do that.

817
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:21,320
Rym: I'm not talking about using like watches like active polls like see if this process is running or whatever.

818
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:34,740
Rym: I'm talking about having an active process an agent on your servers that grips through the logs all the time in real time and Instead of using grep It's actually like a C program that is designed to know when a new log file is written and start reading there.

819
00:52:34,842 --> 00:52:35,660
Rym: It knows where it left off.

820
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:44,380
Rym: It doesn't keep reading the same files over and over again And have it just send an SNMP trap to some monitoring system with different more log levels.

821
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:46,900
Rym: So say, you know, so you've got your low-level text.

822
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:56,537
Rym: They got a console open and it that if there's an alarm it pops up saying, you know bad, but I'd crashed on the wind server Wins wins.

823
00:52:58,161 --> 00:53:01,700
Scott: Yeah, nobody freaking says that shit up except for like, you know the top of the heap type.

824
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,919
Rym: Oh, you know who sets it up the financial world.

825
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:06,800
Rym: You wanna know why cuz all the smart people and all the money is there?

826
00:53:07,381 --> 00:53:08,926
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, there's.

827
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:10,792
Scott: I bet Twitter doesn't have any SNMPs.

828
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,798
Scott: Yeah, they don't know what they don't.

829
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,373
Scott: If they even know what it is, they're.

830
00:53:14,393 --> 00:53:14,960
Scott: no it's awesome.

831
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:21,428
Rym: When I talk to vendors for like I'm buying a product and I usually the question will come up I like so how should we monitor this?

832
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:28,200
Rym: and the stony silence that follows is amazing And sometimes I'll venture forth and say is there a MIB?

833
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,876
Rym: Can I?

834
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:42,263
Rym: monitor this thing with SNMP and No one has ever given me an answer other than I'll have to get back to you on that Googling SNMP.

835
00:53:42,364 --> 00:53:45,775
Scott: Yeah, the vendors are not the biggest technology people, right?

836
00:53:45,795 --> 00:53:47,140
Scott: That's the reason that they're salesmen.

837
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:54,180
Scott: You know if you talk to the developers They maybe they know what SNMP was but 99% of the time the answer is we didn't do that.

838
00:53:54,882 --> 00:53:57,030
Scott: Uses that in the whole world except monitor your logs.

839
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:04,239
Rym: You've got to think if you're a sysadmin and you care about the server I mean you might not care like if our forum goes down for an hour Whatever we fix it, whatever.

840
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:08,020
Scott: But if you if you're was line ode sends me emails when that happens.

841
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,492
Rym: Yeah, if you're running a business or you care about your server or whatever.

842
00:54:11,533 --> 00:54:13,600
Rym: like my counter-struct server has been down for like a month.

843
00:54:13,661 --> 00:54:14,206
Rym: I don't care.

844
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:15,539
Rym: I'll fix it when I fix it.

845
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,359
Rym: But like it crashed for like a week before I realized it cuz I didn't monitor it.

846
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,440
Rym: Yeah, but if I cared I would have set up a system that would actively monitor this thing.

847
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,280
Rym: I would monitor the logs.

848
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:29,940
Rym: I would have it tell me if say a new version of steam came out and the client wasn't working anymore.

849
00:54:30,662 --> 00:54:32,668
Rym: But it's a fine line between.

850
00:54:32,688 --> 00:54:34,414
Rym: if you send too much stuff.

851
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:35,497
Rym: No one's gonna read the.

852
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:37,103
Rym: read the monitoring No one's gonna care.

853
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:40,880
Rym: if you send too little then the monitoring is useless because you won't actually know what caused a problem.

854
00:54:41,661 --> 00:54:44,009
Scott: Sometimes you've also got to have it even more intelligent.

855
00:54:44,029 --> 00:54:57,825
Scott: if you've got a whole bunch of systems and you're short on administrators You got to be like, okay, if something is ultra important like business critical thing is down It should call people on the phone and have a voice that says but if it's just like, you know Okay thing that's not.

856
00:54:57,845 --> 00:55:02,080
Scott: business critical is down and it's the weekend have it send an email first thing on Monday.

857
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:02,763
Rym: This is again.

858
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:03,927
Rym: my log levels are important.

859
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:04,349
Rym: I mean I kept.

860
00:55:04,449 --> 00:55:08,930
Rym: we kept saying things like fatal warning though message Those are in log4j.

861
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:15,133
Rym: Those are like the standard log channels Yeah, and if a system is written well fatal means it couldn't recover.

862
00:55:15,233 --> 00:55:16,436
Rym: fatal is a fatal error.

863
00:55:16,477 --> 00:55:17,620
Rym: The program is fucked.

864
00:55:18,022 --> 00:55:21,120
Rym: Yep, so you probably want a fatal error to page someone.

865
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:26,240
Rym: Yeah, a warning says this may or may not be a problem depending on all these other factors.

866
00:55:26,762 --> 00:55:30,319
Rym: It's just a warning and you have to decide if warnings should be paid attention to.

867
00:55:30,339 --> 00:55:32,171
Scott: you gotta You gotta understand what the warning says.

868
00:55:32,232 --> 00:55:33,480
Scott: the text next to it is important.

869
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:38,380
Rym: You gotta understand what logs mean and it's a lot easier when you're writing your own logs.

870
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:49,347
Rym: But it'd be a good idea to understand what those things mean to say the Linux kernel Varlog messages what matters in there and what doesn't You know when you turn your computer on?

871
00:55:49,367 --> 00:55:53,746
Scott: a lot of people turn computers on especially Linux ones and a whole bunch of text Flies by on the screen.

872
00:55:53,947 --> 00:55:56,200
Scott: if you still have you know, depending on what system using?

873
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:58,852
Scott: Yeah, and people don't look at that text or understand it.

874
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:00,660
Rym: most people nor do they realize the D message.

875
00:56:00,842 --> 00:56:02,379
Rym: They can go look at that after the fact.

876
00:56:02,649 --> 00:56:08,280
Scott: Yeah But I mean, it's like that's text is probably important and you should read it and understand what it's saying.

877
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,007
Scott: It's not there for no reason at all.

878
00:56:10,429 --> 00:56:12,900
Scott: They put that there for you know, a reason it wasn't.

879
00:56:13,723 --> 00:56:19,832
Rym: You know the problem with like a Windows box where an error pops up and you just ignore it and just click OK But logs are different.

880
00:56:20,194 --> 00:56:21,040
Rym: You're a system administrator.

881
00:56:22,021 --> 00:56:29,432
Rym: Your job is this if you complain about the users not reading the error messages and you don't look at varlog Messages to diagnose the problem then shut up.

882
00:56:29,492 --> 00:56:31,803
Rym: You're just as bad as them I think is what a lot.

883
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:38,430
Scott: what happens these days right is a lot of system administrators that are out in the world are not Actually system administrators.

884
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,240
Scott: They're just really really good users.

885
00:56:40,321 --> 00:56:48,420
Scott: So they get the job, you know, mostly the helpdesk job Which is I can help people fix their desktop problems because I'm a really good desktop computer user.

886
00:56:48,723 --> 00:56:55,100
Scott: But they're not a systems administrator But in the Windows world they can being a really good user gets you most of the way to systems administrator.

887
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:59,276
Scott: You can install exchange you put the CDs in the server and you install it and 99 you send.

888
00:56:59,316 --> 00:57:01,184
Rym: your work is Doing exchange.

889
00:57:01,224 --> 00:57:05,460
Scott: you're living in the exchange world or you know setting even setting up an active directory, right?

890
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:23,284
Scott: But it's when it actually comes to the administering stuff the things that a normal user would never have to do or encounter They totally fail and thus most systems especially Windows systems and Unix systems administered by non Unix Hardcore Unix people are totally fail Which is most systems.

891
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:28,603
Rym: my advice if you're a young kid in college and you're learning IT or CS or whatever and you don't like Programming.

892
00:57:28,864 --> 00:57:29,426
Rym: Well, you know what?

893
00:57:29,728 --> 00:57:31,275
Rym: It's applicable to IT and CS.

894
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:32,420
Rym: CS people need to know logging.

895
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:40,600
Scott: Oh, yeah, if you're see I mean even because you're the ones writing the logs Yeah, the point is if you know programming right you still you shouldn't you need to learn enough system administrating?

896
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,765
Scott: You know that way you can set.

897
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:54,280
Scott: if you you can set up your own servers to run your own shit and you don't need To outsource it to anyone also will understand the way system administrators Well, yeah, if you're writing if you're developing an application need to have a view of the whole system.

898
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,766
Scott: You can't just be having such as narrow view of just your code and the world around it Just not even care.

899
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:13,839
Rym: at the same time if you're an IT guy You still need to know enough about coding to understand like if a developer logs of thread numbers So you can trace like what one thread was doing versus another thread or say a program crashed You see the exception and then you do a stack trace to see what was going on.

900
00:58:14,342 --> 00:58:17,618
Rym: If you can't read any of that and understand it to a degree you're screwed.

901
00:58:17,638 --> 00:58:20,360
Rym: CS And IT overlaps more than a lot of people realize.

902
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,565
Scott: Yeah, but you know whatever.

903
00:58:21,686 --> 00:58:26,991
Scott: whatever side you pick right make sure that you you know What you need to know about logs in the very least.

904
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:31,592
Rym: just take look at your Ubuntu box Which I assume you have and or virtual machine.

905
00:58:31,673 --> 00:58:36,007
Rym: go to var log Do an LS and look at all that stuff.

906
00:58:36,027 --> 00:58:40,900
Scott: There's tons of logs in there and read documentation about log rotate and syslog ng.

907
00:58:41,181 --> 00:58:42,286
Rym: Yep, syslog ng.

908
00:58:42,326 --> 00:58:43,230
Rym: don't use just syslog.

909
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:45,360
Scott: Well everyone every modern system is syslog ng.

910
00:58:45,641 --> 00:58:49,178
Scott: Yeah, and by the if you see you're gonna see a lot of things in the world that are called ng.

911
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,642
Scott: That means next generation.

912
00:58:56,935 --> 00:58:59,460
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

913
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:04,397
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

914
