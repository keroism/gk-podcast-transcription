Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:30,625
Rym: I'm Finally catching up on Hokuto.

7
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:31,189
Rym: no Ken.

8
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:36,510
Rym: Oh really ever since PAX when we showed everyone Hokuto's on kai ken for the thousandth time.

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,798
Scott: I don't know how that's possible.

10
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:42,801
Scott: considering you are dead How could you watch TV if you are dead?

11
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:43,605
Rym: I don't know.

12
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,108
Rym: there's something.

13
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,590
Rym: just suddenly I was inspired to start watching it again, and I'm blowing through like two or three episodes a day.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,328
Rym: I finally it's sad, but I just met Toki.

15
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:54,155
Rym: Uh-huh, I got a ways to go.

16
00:00:54,175 --> 00:01:04,388
Rym: all right, but we would do more shows on anime, but I watch so many animes you have no idea, so let's do a show on something.

17
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,850
Scott: well I watched these animes a while ago, and I don't think you watch the same ones.

18
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:09,240
Rym: I don't think you've watched anything.

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:09,763
Rym: I've watched.

20
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:10,629
Rym: we got a swap.

21
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:16,724
Rym: I think we should do a movie I think we should do like vampire hunter D or the slayers movies or something.

22
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:18,450
Scott: didn't we door to do slayers moving?

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,430
Rym: Uh we did the slayers movie.

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,255
Scott: We could only one.

25
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:23,628
Rym: we could do one of the other mini movies like the OAVs.

26
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:25,460
Scott: You're gonna tell about 30 minutes.

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,567
Scott: the things aren't even 30 minutes long.

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,195
Scott: We could watch it in the time.

29
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:29,240
Scott: It takes to talk about it.

30
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:31,069
Rym: I think I could do a show on one of those.

31
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:33,234
Scott: What would be the point?

32
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:34,619
Rym: what about vampire hunter D?

33
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:37,770
Rym: It's only an hour long, but it feels like four hours.

34
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:46,249
Rym: And I feel like we should do some old anime movies, maybe even some bad ones.

35
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:48,598
Scott: Legend of Lemnier.

36
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,549
Rym: I could watch that shit again.

37
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,120
Scott: Good you all on your own.

38
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,990
Rym: Here's what I remember about Legend of Lemnier.

39
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:58,590
Rym: There's a dude and a girl there's breasts, and then I fell asleep.

40
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:02,786
Rym: I woke up and the credits are rolling and nobody talked about it again except how bad it was.

41
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:06,805
Rym: there you go Yeah, all right one down done.

42
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:11,014
Rym: Yeah Next so is there any Anime related news?

43
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:13,001
Scott: no really all the news is totally lame.

44
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,546
Scott: and said about comics.

45
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:15,510
Rym: any comic news?

46
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:16,615
Scott: No, it's all really lame.

47
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:19,749
Rym: and said yeah, well the Comic Con in New York isn't until October.

48
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,401
Scott: Well a lot of thing is around this time of year.

49
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:26,660
Scott: all these you know these companies are not exactly Active companies that have things going on all the time.

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,664
Scott: right they're kind of slow.

51
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:29,793
Scott: They don't have a lot of stuff They're not big.

52
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:33,910
Scott: so it's not like they have news every week, or you know you can't have a blog.

53
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,056
Scott: It's it's you had a blog.

54
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:38,777
Scott: you'd have to have a blog about all the companies at once or to be able to Content.

55
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:40,308
Scott: so you know it's like.

56
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:48,770
Scott: well You know when it's when it comes time for San Diego Comic Con which is in July right leading up to it They save up all their news and their announcements.

57
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,201
Rym: Well, I think the trouble is more that what news will they ever had?

58
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:55,090
Rym: what news will the comic industry in America ever have other?

59
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,555
Rym: than Spider-man is continuing.

60
00:02:58,057 --> 00:03:01,869
Rym: spider-man is now being drawn by this person instead of that person.

61
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,694
Rym: well They had has been added to a fourth team 10th team.

62
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,250
Scott: yeah, you know they have do have news that we could talk.

63
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,042
Scott: You know if you want to talk about that kind of stuff right.

64
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:16,300
Scott: for example lately DC every summer these companies usually Marvel and DC a big events.

65
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:16,802
Scott: right.

66
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:26,254
Scott: you know the big crossover of the crisis of infinite comic books The nerds have to buy right so that the nerds are actually complaining because DC's big event is Flashpoint.

67
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,590
Scott: it has something to do with the flash.

68
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:34,830
Scott: But apparently and I know this because they sent me a free copy of how does the flash not age?

69
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:37,843
Scott: Don't ask this like there's multiple different flashes.

70
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:39,090
Scott: It was the original.

71
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,014
Rym: Why are there more?

72
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:40,999
Rym: what happened to the old?

73
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:41,420
Rym: like what?

74
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:42,304
Rym: where's the oldest one?

75
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:43,530
Scott: there was the Golden Age flash?

76
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,292
Scott: I think he's dead.

77
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:45,196
Rym: so how?

78
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:45,859
Rym: whose is it?

79
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,742
Rym: It's a new guy.

80
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:48,550
Scott: Yeah, there was the Golden Age flash.

81
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,132
Scott: There's a new guy.

82
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:50,277
Scott: who's the Silver Age flash.

83
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,762
Rym: No the old guy.

84
00:03:51,782 --> 00:03:52,927
Rym: Yeah, so they.

85
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:53,710
Rym: so they met each other.

86
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,934
Rym: How'd he pass on his power?

87
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:56,700
Scott: They didn't pass on the power.

88
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:04,647
Scott: They all have the same power separately, so Yeah, that sounds perfectly plausible the same way that a bunch of different people from planet Krypton.

89
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:09,022
Rym: if they all came to earth They're all Superman, but how did the flash get his power in the first place?

90
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:09,404
Scott: I don't know.

91
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:11,110
Scott: I'm not a flash expert.

92
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,257
Scott: This is like basic nerd.

93
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,070
Scott: I only know like the barest minimal information about the flash.

94
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:17,599
Scott: There was I don't know which.

95
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,490
Scott: I know that some of the names of the flash.

96
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,958
Scott: There's a there's a flash named Wally wood, and there's a flash named something else.

97
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:31,670
Scott: I Don't know, but there's a. there's like three different flashes basically right and there was the Golden Age flash.

98
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,648
Scott: Then there was the Silver Age flash and in Christ on Infinite Earths.

99
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:49,650
Scott: Oh god There's like six flashes on this Wikipedia page in Christ on Infinite Earths the second flash died and the kid flash Right became the flash flash, and now he's the fat kid flash is the flash flash, but there's a new kid flash.

100
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:53,559
Scott: So you know there's like the kid flash Wikipedia.

101
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,281
Rym: Thanks so much.

102
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:57,790
Rym: all incarnations of the flash possess super speed blah blah blah blah.

103
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:02,320
Rym: They all acquired it by some means.

104
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:05,130
Scott: yes, thanks something you do with the speed force.

105
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,669
Scott: The speed force it's something like they had some bullshit like that.

106
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:12,047
Rym: Is there red speed force as opposed to blue speed?

107
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:12,329
Rym: for no?

108
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,070
Scott: That's great for as green lanterns have this is this green lanterns and black lanterns and white lanterns and orange and blue.

109
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,417
Rym: Tonight also has that.

110
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:21,910
Scott: I know I bet the flash they won't flash.

111
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,378
Scott: Maybe that's a flash point is about.

112
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:28,689
Scott: but anyway the reason that the nerds are complaining wait How come bizarro flash is still fast.

113
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:30,554
Scott: That's a good question.

114
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:31,881
Rym: Why isn't he slow?

115
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,589
Scott: good point you win the winner is you?

116
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,759
Scott: Anyway, they're complaining about flash point.

117
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,566
Scott: because guess that get this right.

118
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:41,054
Scott: it has It's made up.

119
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:42,621
Scott: You know there is a core series.

120
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:43,566
Scott: That's like it's made up.

121
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:46,920
Scott: Well obviously There's that there's a core flash point series.

122
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,462
Scott: That's the flight.

123
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:48,385
Scott: you know the miniseries.

124
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:49,550
Scott: that is flashpoint, right?

125
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,309
Scott: But then of course is all these other books that cross so cross into it.

126
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:56,589
Scott: You know like if you read regular old issues of the flash well They're gonna have something to do with flashpoint.

127
00:05:57,192 --> 00:06:01,784
Scott: But they have also started a bunch of miniseries just for flashpoint.

128
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:04,090
Scott: that are you know flashpoint miniseries?

129
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,195
Scott: They're all three issues.

130
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:08,110
Scott: guess how many miniseries they're making for flashpoint?

131
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:19,214
Rym: You wouldn't ask unless the number was really big or really small 40 16, so that's 16 times 3 issues of flashpoint miniseries Crossovers.

132
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:21,402
Scott: and the nerds are like complaining big.

133
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,270
Rym: the nerds are like you're taking my money.

134
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,636
Scott: Each of those is three dollars.

135
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:33,480
Scott: three dollars times 16 times 3 to get all these just Crossover less important flashpoint issues.

136
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:41,344
Scott: and the reason I know this is because the giant stupid catalog They sent me a free copy without me asking for it, so all right, but anyway.

137
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:43,369
Rym: Oh, I guess he doesn't kill anyone.

138
00:06:44,832 --> 00:06:46,864
Rym: Whatever, I'm reading this article on the flash.

139
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:49,317
Rym: It's kind of Not interesting.

140
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:51,490

156
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:41,970
Scott: Really, it'd be like it'd be like if to Nami What when to Nami still existed was its own company and Cartoon Network paid to Nami to put to Nami on the Cartoon Network?

157
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,730

00:07:58,868 --> 00:07:59,610
Scott: you know stuff like that.

161
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:15,850
Scott: But basically you know they were recently sued by you know Japan because Apparently there was some question that they may have been Making money off of Yu-Gi-Oh and like hiding that money from the actual owners of Yu-Gi-Oh in Japan.

162
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,360
Rym: So they didn't have to give them royalties.

163
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:19,934
Scott: It's like you know.

164
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:23,830
Scott: they bought the Yu-Gi-Oh license, but then they made money off the Yu-Gi-Oh license.

165
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:26,599
Scott: They made like extra money off of it by selling DVDs.

166
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,090
Scott: and isn't there another lawsuit going on involving the Yu-Gi-Oh cards?

167
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:31,073
Rym: Oh my god.

168
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:31,796
Rym: I forgot about that.

169
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:35,067
Rym: the company that was making them that what may have been making bootlegs.

170
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:35,850
Rym: I barely remember.

171
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:39,979
Scott: Yeah, there's this weird stuff going on without with that too And that's not for kids as far as I can tell.

172
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:42,390
Scott: so there's all sorts of weird stuff with Yu-Gi-Oh.

173
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:48,885
Scott: Or maybe the fact maybe it's just the Japanese licensor Owner of Yu-Gi-Oh is getting all angry and wants to try to?

174
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:49,790
Scott: I don't know well.

175
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:54,170
Rym: I just I have this vision of a Dave and Joel style boardroom where they're sitting around.

176
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,053
Rym: They're like Tanaka.

177
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:57,743
Rym: We need you to rip off the stupid American.

178
00:08:57,783 --> 00:08:59,590
Scott: go get all the Yu-Gi-Oh monies from America.

179
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:00,459
Scott: We didn't get enough from.

180
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,065
Scott: we're poor.

181
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:05,749
Scott: be Inscrutable right anyway, so for kids, right?

182
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,989
Scott: partially because that lawsuit and partially just because they suck.

183
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:12,910
Scott: Finally as you know they were on a downhill spiral for a long time.

184
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,130
Scott: I mean they were getting delisted and stuff right, but now they have declared the chapter 11 bankruptcy.

185
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:22,384
Scott: Ah good old chapter 11, which me chap for those you don't know this pretty much.

186
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:24,410
Scott: You know you think chapter 11.

187
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,520
Scott: Well now that's 11 different things you have to know really.

188
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:28,550
Scott: no you don't have to know 11 different things.

189
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,195
Scott: You know two different things right?

190
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:35,932
Scott: you know 11 and 7 because no one ever uses any other number besides 11 or 7.

191
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:37,037
Rym: I'll just gloss over that.

192
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,022
Rym: come on go moving on.

193
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:40,533
Scott: 7 is we are done We're going away.

194
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:40,996
Scott: Goodbye.

195
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:48,066
Scott: and 11 is we're gonna keep doing work even though We're out of money, and we don't have to pay people anymore.

196
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:52,483
Rym: Yeah, awesome Huh could have seen that one coming.

197
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:59,490
Scott: yep Actually, I'm surprised it took this long because why did I always wonder why people take so long?

198
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:00,890
Scott: It's like you're going.

199
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:01,155
Scott: Why?

200
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:01,562
Scott: it's like.

201
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:04,930
Scott: It's like if you're in the bathroom.

202
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,518
Scott: You don't have to declare bankruptcy yet, but once the toe is in the toilet you might as well You know what's good.

203
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:11,333
Rym: You're going down, but Scott here's the thing.

204
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:13,903
Scott: say I am on the no one escapes the toilet bowl.

205
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:18,897
Rym: say I'm on the board of a company and I am technically beholden to the shareholders.

206
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:29,146
Rym: if I know the company is going bankrupt and because of the Base product we make is shit, and there's no way to make the company profitable again.

207
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,450
Rym: It is a lost cause.

208
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:42,910
Rym: I cannot Tell them that I cannot run through this as though I know that because they can then claim that I am in fact not running the business in their best interests.

209
00:10:43,312 --> 00:10:44,397
Scott: Why don't you tell them that?

210
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,235
Scott: and then they'll know that you're running the business in the best interest except There's no way.

211
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:53,739
Rym: because the moment it is revealed that I know Companies worth dick because no one's gonna buy it.

212
00:10:53,819 --> 00:11:10,588
Rym: It's not worth anything so that good Yeah, so basically your company is we're dick if you're selling it to people for money when it's not we're Pretend that everything's fine until the last possible second when it's too late to get any money out of them.

213
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,518
Rym: once I've spent all my cash reserves Then I declare bankruptcy.

214
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:19,356
Rym: if I declare before they're gonna take all my cash to pay my debts What do you need that cash for?

215
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,103
Scott: you're just gonna spend it on poop anyway?

216
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:22,890
Rym: Yeah, I'm paying my employees longer.

217
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,522
Scott: Give give the all the money to the employees like everyone.

218
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:28,370
Scott: Here's all the money open for treasure chest.

219
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,469
Scott: They all empty the treasure now, and you leave now.

220
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,562
Rym: I'm legally liable to the shareholders for pissing away their money on.

221
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:38,695
Scott: no you tell them that the money was already gone and you Demonstrate that you know.

222
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:43,244
Scott: you tell the shareholders beforehand look we're gonna be out of business And then you give the money away, and then you leave.

223
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:45,215
Rym: now You know what.

224
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:48,650
Rym: there's really no easy way out or how does political and economic system?

225
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,459
Scott: You just say hey look this company's going down the shitter.

226
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,630
Scott: give the money back to the shareholders and then leave.

227
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,339
Rym: Yeah, I would just quit.

228
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,063
Scott: you're quitting is good - yeah The CEO in fact did quit.

229
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:04,181
Scott: according to this article The third quarter of 2010 the chairman and CEO Alfred Kahn resigned.

230
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:05,425
Scott: all right there you go.

231
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:07,210
Rym: Yeah, oh my god.

232
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,430
Rym: now I just have because you know we're doing that anime openers from around the world among other panels anime Boston next weekend.

233
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:21,887
Rym: So I was putting the finishing touches on it And I listened to the English opener to one piece several times one piece.

234
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:24,453
Rym: What's the line?

235
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:28,566
Rym: it's like he's sailing to find one piece in the grand line.

236
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,858
Rym: yeah in case he didn't know Oh, how do you get that way?

237
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:32,510
Rym: he ate the gum gum fruit?

238
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:33,770
Rym: Yep, anyway.

239
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:40,346
Rym: So there is some weird stuff going on in the manga world in Japan and a lot of people.

240
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:44,579
Rym: you've probably seen this so-called Jay Komi purify thing.

241
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,341
Scott: I never heard of this.

242
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:47,006
Rym: really it's all over the news.

243
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:48,070
Rym: people have been tweeting about it.

244
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:52,710
Rym: So basically the deal is that Jay Komi distributes manga legally.

245
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:02,962
Rym: Yep There is a lot of illegal manga out there as in stuff That's out of print But it's translated or not and you can just get scans of the whole thing.

246
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:09,624
Rym: I mean we have those scans of sanctuary that are Out there and such and it's illegal as in copyright or illegal as in.

247
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:11,550
Scott: they're showing the pink on your hand.

248
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,357
Scott: You're not a lot of copyright.

249
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:13,366
Rym: We're not talking about the pink.

250
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:19,041
Rym: okay I mean if we hey if we if pink were an issue We'd be all over this as would Daryl Surratt, but no pink.

251
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:21,110
Rym: It's just copyright.

252
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:22,815
Rym: So the deal is all right.

253
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:27,650
Rym: there is illegal you know copyright infringing manga out there on file-sharing networks.

254
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:35,329
Rym: What if you go to the creator and you say look or whoever owns the license who won't reprint it for whatever reason say look?

255
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:44,909
Rym: Rather than prosecuting these people over the thing that you're not distributing How about we take all the torrents and we put out better torrents?

256
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:53,810
Rym: We take the scans out there if we can we put out better scans And we put ads for all your new work in those torrents, and we still make the torrents free?

257
00:13:53,971 --> 00:14:02,625
Rym: Yes, and then we bless the torrents by saying look total amnesty nobody's getting sued about sharing these all right And it's actually kind of a good idea now.

258
00:14:02,645 --> 00:14:03,330
Scott: That's a great idea.

259
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:04,077
Scott: Yeah, now.

260
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:05,510
Rym: I don't want to get into all the details of it.

261
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:11,110
Scott: You can read it yourself, but and do they make like a nice accessible easily searchable website where these torrents are files are hosted?

262
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:12,850
Rym: I haven't looked into that too much.

263
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:15,550
Scott: Or are they just distributing them on the Pirate Bay with everything else?

264
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:21,370
Rym: It appears that that might be on the docket to actually distribute some of this stuff straight up through j-combing.

265
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:22,510
Scott: How about translating to English?

266
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:26,115
Rym: What the root of this is that?

267
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:42,190
Rym: remember that uproar among deviant art and artist alley types many years ago About how there was a clause in some new copyright law about orphaned works where if a work was orphaned then oh no you lose Your copyright and people who draw dog-headed girls were mad that they'd lose their copyright on the dog-headed girls.

268
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,249
Scott: Yeah, after like a zillion years.

269
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:49,330
Rym: So I feel like we need something like that.

270
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:55,447
Rym: But actually closer to this we need a sort of way for either creators or this isn't?

271
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:57,192
Scott: this isn't an orphaned work Situation.

272
00:14:57,232 --> 00:14:59,861
Scott: an orphaned work is when I didn't say it was.

273
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:02,350
Rym: I'm saying it's like abandonware where but Scott have.

274
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,777
Scott: no I you can't contact the copyright holders.

275
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:16,062
Rym: I know I didn't say it was but it's a similar situation and that here We have work where we do know who made it, but there is no Legitimate way to get the work at all.

276
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:16,563
Scott: there is.

277
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:22,510
Scott: you have to contact the copyright holder And it's up to them and they refuse to all right for whatever reason they won't reprint it.

278
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,294
Rym: So what do you do now?

279
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:24,963
Rym: It's a work that can't be gotten.

280
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:28,298
Rym: yet under copyright law You can still sue people for distributing.

281
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:31,210
Rym: it hasn't been abandoned, but I didn't say it has been I know.

282
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,990
Scott: But they're refusing to distribute it or print it or make it available in any way.

283
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:40,310
Rym: So I think the genius here is that one Jake homie is going to the creators and saying look it would be illegal.

284
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:41,660
Rym: What do you say?

285
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,010
Rym: we get together and do this?

286
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,060
Rym: It's basically a way to get around the problems of copyright law.

287
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:53,799
Rym: if all the people who have a vested interest in the printing Play along all right I'm saying yeah, it's a great idea.

288
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:54,825
Rym: I think we need to do this more.

289
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:59,685
Scott: no yeah But I mean this is basically like you just said what do you do if they're not cooperating?

290
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:01,130
Scott: well this case they are cooperating.

291
00:16:01,513 --> 00:16:04,110
Scott: So it's really not a change in any law or anything.

292
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:05,286
Rym: I didn't say it was a change in law.

293
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:11,147
Rym: But in this case I feel like people don't even think to go to the publishers and ask them.

294
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:13,695
Scott: they do they ask them all The time and they're always huge jerks.

295
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:15,139
Scott: It's this is actually rare.

296
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:22,122
Scott: I don't think as many people actually Disney We really really really want you to make Song of the South DVDs crickets.

297
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,630
Rym: Okay, so Disney giant faceless corporation.

298
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,495
Scott: Right those are the ones.

299
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:28,269
Scott: those are the ones that are holding all the cards essentially in the US.

300
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:29,013
Scott: This is only.

301
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,019
Scott: this is a rare case.

302
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,924
Scott: how many you know?

303
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:31,889
Scott: it's pretty much most.

304
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:36,290
Rym: There's tons of comics mangas even novels that are just out of print straight up.

305
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:42,790
Rym: Yeah, and there's a good chance that for many of these smaller things especially for imagine in the u.s.

306
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:48,930
Scott: All that I've seen this many times over many years my entire life many many works that you know it's like.

307
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,717
Scott: hey Does that a print?

308
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:50,789
Scott: I really wish it was in print.

309
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:59,590
Scott: Almost all of those cases are either a abandoned where you can't find the rights holder Or it's questionable or B. There is a rights holder, and they don't want to print it.

310
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:09,176
Rym: It's very rare that you'll have a case where there is It's a difference between not wanting to print it and being willing to bless Illegal distribution of it.

311
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:10,320
Scott: right that's you know.

312
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:19,771
Rym: all it is is that there are a few I don't people have gone to Especially in the US people who do own a work and don't want to republish it Which you might.

313
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:21,580
Rym: you can understand why someone might not want to.

314
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:23,650
Scott: maybe you have a work where it's not gonna sell.

315
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:25,359
Rym: Yeah, you don't think you'll make any money off.

316
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:28,757
Rym: well, but go to them and say hey Do you have anything new you're working on?

317
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,210
Rym: try to sell it to them like look this old property of yours is worth nothing.

318
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:34,889
Rym: But I see you're working on a new thing.

319
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,999
Rym: What if you let the old thing for free?

320
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,403
Rym: is advertising for the new thing?

321
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:42,333
Rym: try to sell it to the people who have us Bested interest in it.

322
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:46,386
Rym: you won't get Disney, but you'll get like the next level down.

323
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:47,710
Scott: here's here's the problem.

324
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:53,480
Scott: Let's say I start up a company right and I go around to people and I say hey I see you have this book.

325
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,207
Scott: It's out of print.

326
00:17:54,469 --> 00:17:58,329
Scott: right why don't you let me make a free ebook and I'll put ads in it for whatever you're working on now.

327
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:03,545
Scott: and And then I mean well, I put that on my website as a torrent and everyone downloads it.

328
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:17,076
Scott: Yeah, they see these ads and Meanwhile I'm making money off other ads on the site that I'm selling and now those people who I you know Whoever works are being handed out are gonna want money from me, but they're gonna be like hey No, I don't want I'm done with this deal.

329
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,879
Scott: You're making a lot of money.

330
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:18,080
Scott: Well.

331
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,373
Rym: You know what that's just a contract Negotiation yeah That's.

332
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,350
Scott: but as the thing is most of them are gonna be jerks like that.

333
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,541
Rym: I don't know if they would necessarily a very few.

334
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:30,254
Scott: and if you know in Japan and that's nothing Why do you need it?

335
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:33,190
Scott: if you want to put torrents out of your own stuff that are blessed?

336
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,764
Scott: Why do you need someone to do it for you?

337
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:35,290
Scott: Just do it?

338
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,446
Rym: I think the problem is that people don't realize or think.

339
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:39,029
Rym: to do it.

340
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,836
Rym: You know first you don't need some.

341
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:44,309
Scott: if you own a work you don't need somebody to help you distribute it.

342
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:45,369
Scott: You know for free.

343
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:51,690
Rym: Saying I think there are people out there or companies out there that don't realize this is an option like they haven't you.

344
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,966
Rym: I mean Think about in technology how many times there's an obvious way to capitalize on something.

345
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:58,170
Scott: Hey, you got this don't do it.

346
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,476
Scott: Hey, you made this old movie.

347
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:00,702
Scott: You're never gonna put it on DVD.

348
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:02,290
Scott: Let me help you put it on YouTube.

349
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:04,481
Scott: It's like you can put it on YouTube on your own.

350
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:05,688
Rym: I don't think they realize they can't.

351
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:11,290
Rym: but anyway I feel like we should go further, and I think I've said this on other shows before especially for technology.

352
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:17,268
Rym: I feel like in the US at least we need of an eminent domain equivalent for copyright and patent.

353
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:29,965
Rym: yeah I do think that I feel like there should be extraordinary Situations where the government can step in and do the same thing they do when they take away some guys land to build a freeway To take away some guys IP to build an internet freeway.

354
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:30,889
Scott: Martin Luther King's speech.

355
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:45,811
Rym: But anyway, it's time for things of the day, so you know Banksy you're familiar with him Street artist and such.

356
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:54,996
Rym: well Banksy apparently backed a quote Scatological a Russian art collective all right called vonya mm-hmm.

357
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:57,923
Rym: vonya means war The war.

358
00:19:58,144 --> 00:19:58,926
Scott: which war is that?

359
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:02,154
Scott: uh the war the vonya vonya all right.

360
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:14,099
Rym: so vonya likes to do Imagine improv everywhere coupled with Banksy style graffiti coupled with sometimes being gigantic douches.

361
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:22,149
Rym: One of their quote-unquote guerrilla art exhibits involved Surrounding for police cars in like st.

362
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:23,675
Rym: Petersburg and flipping them over okay.

363
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:28,276
Rym: Yeah So what they did and I've got some pictures of it.

364
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:28,859
Rym: It's pretty great.

365
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:32,278
Rym: This is very reminiscent of our old penis on the Parthenon.

366
00:20:33,422 --> 00:20:43,669
Rym: But quote members members of vonya two of whom are awaiting trial on hooliganism charges Whitewashed the decoration on a bridge in st.

367
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,291
Rym: Petersburg.

368
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,457
Scott: Oh, I seen this when the very old.

369
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:49,580
Rym: well the news There's the news about this is what's cool, okay?

370
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:57,620
Rym: So when the bridge was raised because it was a drawbridge up an erect phallus ended up facing the local headquarters of the FSB.

371
00:20:57,901 --> 00:20:58,262
Rym: We have this.

372
00:20:58,303 --> 00:20:59,388
Scott: is that happened a long time ago.

373
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:00,292
Rym: I happen in June.

374
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:01,860
Scott: Yep the successor to the KGB.

375
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:03,265
Scott: So I was like area.

376
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:06,820
Rym: This is this huge graffiti, and it's a pretty great gigantic penis.

377
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,425
Rym: There are pictures of it everywhere is awesome.

378
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:12,517
Rym: Mostly because it would erect itself every time a boat wanted to go on.

379
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:13,159
Scott: I know right.

380
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,538
Rym: so do you know what the work was actually called?

381
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:21,044
Rym: a dick held prisoner At the FSB?

382
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:24,295
Rym: all right it was 65 meters tall.

383
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:27,910
Scott: now that that alone It's only a meter longer than mine.

384
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:39,494
Rym: that alone would not Qualify as a thing of the day because people draw dicks on stuff all the time and while I enjoy Dicks being drawn on things actually last night remember cock medias draw.

385
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:47,010
Rym: it came out of the vault so I watched it again but It won a gigantic art contest.

386
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:51,229
Rym: nice after a series of crazy Drama.

387
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:59,380
Rym: it won 400,000 rubles at the 2010 innovation prize by the National Center for Contemporary Arts in Moscow.

388
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,864
Scott: 400,000 rubles is like $4.

389
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:01,968
Scott: It's like 10 grand.

390
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:03,733
Rym: It's like 10 grand.

391
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:07,189
Rym: rubles are worth shit They're not that bad.

392
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:17,564
Rym: at least it wasn't rupees I'm thinking of Archer because it's 400,000 rubles and the article says which is the equivalent of eight thousand seven hundred pounds Like great.

393
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:18,509
Rym: What's that in real money?

394
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,640
Rym: Sorry so uh yeah?

395
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,685
Rym: They were arrested for that.

396
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:29,000
Rym: Banksy donated like 80,000 pounds to them To cover the costs of defending themselves or drawing this gigantic penis.

397
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:34,660
Rym: But they were disqualified from competition a couple of times and reinstated disqualified.

398
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:35,945
Rym: There's this crazy drama.

399
00:22:36,046 --> 00:22:37,110
Scott: Why is this a drama?

400
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,826
Rym: because the police were like you can't count that as an entry They just spray-painted a penis on a bridge.

401
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:42,387
Scott: That's art.

402
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:47,080
Scott: It was vandalism and vandalism is also art at the same time.

403
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:53,510
Rym: Yes, they're not mutually exclusive and the fact that this one is Pretty great, and I I just find the whole.

404
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,014
Scott: I would have voted for it every time.

405
00:22:55,034 --> 00:22:56,880
Scott: yeah to look at me that.

406
00:22:57,902 --> 00:22:59,747
Rym: So the I got some Russia.

407
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:06,671
Rym: Lisa talking about the prize jury said that he is happy that they defeated the bureaucrats who tried to Deny the group the prize quote.

408
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:12,178
Rym: they are Professionals after all and some of them are brave people.

409
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:17,509
Scott: So I was gonna use something.

410
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:19,075
Scott: more annoying is my thing.

411
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:20,180
Rym: I have one last thing.

412
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:24,080
Rym: Vanya was not happy that they won the award for that work of art.

413
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:37,067
Rym: They had a better work of art that they thought should have won Which was a woman in the group was filmed stealing a chicken from a grocery store by inserting it into her vagina to quote the same guy from before now.

414
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:41,263
Scott: that was something I Would not would have picked the penis on the drawbridge.

415
00:23:41,904 --> 00:23:42,024
Rym: Well.

416
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:43,086
Rym: You're partial to penises.

417
00:23:43,126 --> 00:23:44,108
Rym: I can tell anyway.

418
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:49,892
Scott: I doubt you know Vagina's chickens inside of them is not Problem.

419
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:51,056
Scott: you go beak first.

420
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,686
Rym: Uh I've no idea.

421
00:23:53,707 --> 00:23:55,733
Scott: done some damage It also.

422
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,247
Rym: I'm assuming it was a dead chicken.

423
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:02,941
Scott: Oh Okay, assuming Just put like one of the drumsticks in there.

424
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:04,610
Rym: now the picture on the website.

425
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,227
Rym: They wouldn't actually show the penis, but they did a prank where they just tossed a cat at like a McDonald's employee.

426
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:19,336
Scott: nice All right, so I was gonna use something more annoying as my thing of the day But instead I'm gonna use something that's you know maybe could be a news But isn't actually a news article what it is.

427
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:23,890
Scott: It's an article on Bloomberg, and you always hear about how rich people don't pay taxes.

428
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:25,783
Scott: Yeah, how they avoid taxes.

429
00:24:25,824 --> 00:24:26,549
Scott: well this actually?

430
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:37,465
Scott: Specifically and in great detail lists ten or so actual Techniques and the specific things that rich people do to not pay taxes right.

431
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:39,610
Scott: and here is here's my favorite one of them.

432
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:42,449
Scott: So let's say an exec you're a rich, dude.

433
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:48,306
Scott: You have two hundred million dollars in shares of your company that you work for.

434
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:48,948
Scott: you're an executive.

435
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:49,912
Scott: you're on the board Right.

436
00:24:49,932 --> 00:24:51,662
Scott: you got two hundred million dollars in shares.

437
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:59,937
Scott: you want cash, though You don't want these shares you got to sell those shares yeah to get cash right and if you do that You're gonna pay capital gains tax.

438
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,083
Scott: That's how it works right.

439
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:08,150
Scott: so if you sold today $200,000,000 of shares in your own company you would pay probably thirty million dollars in capital gains taxes.

440
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:11,010
Scott: How could you avoid those capital gains taxes?

441
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,154
Scott: I'm gonna tell you exactly how.

442
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:17,957
Scott: right now step one go to a bank and borrow 200 million dollars from the bank.

443
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:18,500
Scott: all right.

444
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,050
Scott: now you have a loan for 200 million dollars.

445
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,175
Scott: You've got 200 million in cash.

446
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:22,918
Rym: wait wait wait wait.

447
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,495
Rym: so let me guess use the shares as collateral now Yeah, back to loan.

448
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:27,340
Scott: well hold on.

449
00:25:27,863 --> 00:25:29,348
Scott: use the shares as collateral Yeah.

450
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:34,163
Scott: But what happens if the value of the shares were to go up or down?

451
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:37,273
Scott: then your collateral would be sort of shaky Right.

452
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:38,558
Scott: so you need to.

453
00:25:38,598 --> 00:25:47,990
Scott: you need to stiffen that collateral to make sure it stays worth 200 million dollars I'm still thinking about the bridge so that you can so that you can keep the loan ready.

454
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:52,765
Scott: So how do you make sure that the shares are gonna be worth 200 million dollars no matter what happens?

455
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:54,390
Rym: uh?

456
00:25:54,991 --> 00:25:55,472
Rym: I'm not sure.

457
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:56,114
Rym: how do you?

458
00:25:56,315 --> 00:26:04,970
Scott: you buy options on the put and the call so you have the right to buy shares at 200 and And also the right to sell them at 200 million dollars in the future.

459
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:11,510
Scott: Do a standard hedge yes, so now the you bought options in the same stock shares that you just put as collateral.

460
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:20,625
Scott: So now those basically the value of those shares as far as you're concerned is you can always Use those shares to get 200 million dollars no matter what the value of the stock.

461
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:25,464
Scott: even if the value of the stock goes down And if the value of the stock goes up well you can get more than 200 million dollars.

462
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:26,609
Rym: options do expire.

463
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:28,257
Scott: They've been buying them.

464
00:26:28,317 --> 00:26:28,679
Scott: That's right.

465
00:26:28,699 --> 00:26:29,161
Scott: You have to keep.

466
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,628
Scott: you have to keep buying them over and over again.

467
00:26:30,648 --> 00:26:33,059
Scott: all right Eventually right.

468
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:39,921
Scott: you can either Right give the cash back to the bank and repay the loan Which would just mean that you had 200 million dollars.

469
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,830
Scott: you took a loan and you gave it back.

470
00:26:42,091 --> 00:26:42,493
Scott: You didn't paint.

471
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:43,338
Scott: you don't pay any taxes.

472
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:44,484
Scott: You just pay interest to the bank.

473
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:45,167
Scott: right.

474
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:51,664
Scott: or And hopefully if you borrow 200 million dollars I hope that you would be able to use it in a way to make more money than the interest.

475
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:52,648
Scott: otherwise that was stupid.

476
00:26:52,668 --> 00:26:56,836
Scott: or You can just give the shares back.

477
00:26:57,398 --> 00:26:59,305
Scott: right if you just get.

478
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:02,980
Scott: if you just pay the loan back Then you don't pay taxes because you.

479
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,010
Scott: all you did was take out a loan and pay it back.

480
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,814
Scott: You don't pay taxes on.

481
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:10,478
Scott: that sounds about right, and if you gave you let the collateral go to the bank And you keep the money.

482
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:10,519
Scott: I?

483
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:12,896
Scott: You do it get.

484
00:27:12,996 --> 00:27:14,369
Scott: you do have to pay tax on that.

485
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:30,349
Scott: but the tax bill comes many many many years later many years later and During all those years you had 200 million dollars in cash that you could earn money with and hopefully you would earn enough money with To pay off that tax effectively paying no tax.

486
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:37,815
Scott: So you manage to turn 200 million dollars in shares into 200 million dollars in cash plus Without paying any capital gains tax.

487
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:41,304
Scott: what amazes me is that what's great is the greatest thing.

488
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:43,490
Scott: if those 200 million dollar shares?

489
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:49,284
Scott: go to the bank as Collateral if the bank tries to sell them won't the bank have to pay capital gains tax?

490
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:50,810
Scott: or will they not because they're a bank?

491
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:51,726
Scott: I don't know.

492
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:55,282
Scott: Well, I won't get into that or the bank just hold the share.

493
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:56,910
Rym: what I find interesting is that?

494
00:27:57,451 --> 00:28:09,070
Rym: the Republicans are really fighting the fact that currently what one of the initiatives in the administration right now is to Close a lot of these loopholes and instead of raising taxes just enforce the existing tax.

495
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,793
Scott: I don't know why there are any loopholes, but here's the is the Scott I was about to tell you.

496
00:28:12,813 --> 00:28:14,459
Rym: you know why there's loopholes there.

497
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:17,890
Rym: put there on purpose the Republicans no, but so there were loopholes.

498
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:21,670
Rym: I mean, it's pretty easy to have a loophole in an old law that you haven't updated.

499
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:23,337
Scott: Here's he has a lot.

500
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:28,698
Scott: if you make money no matter where the money comes from no matter What country you make it in mind is made in text.

501
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,930
Scott: did the amount of money that you have personal control over?

502
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:34,594
Rym: Oh, I don't know your possession I don't have control over it.

503
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:35,719
Rym: my friend of mine does.

504
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:36,522
Rym: he lives in the Bahamas.

505
00:28:36,844 --> 00:28:38,250
Scott: if you tell him what to do is he?

506
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,623
Scott: Legally obligated to do it.

507
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:40,210
Rym: I don't tell him.

508
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,984
Scott: I just ask him and is he legally obligated to do it?

509
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:44,190
Rym: not by any US law.

510
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:50,240
Scott: If he if he takes that money and does and runs away with it and builds a mansion That's his mansion and lives in it guys fuck you not.

511
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:51,827
Scott: will you try to sue him or will it?

512
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:52,530
Scott: will that be considered?

513
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,670
Rym: Scott it's outside of the US.

514
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,737
Rym: No US laws don't matter.

515
00:28:56,757 --> 00:29:00,170
Rym: so as far as the US is concerned yeah sure he can do whatever he wants with my money.

516
00:29:00,611 --> 00:29:01,834
Rym: Bahamas laws different.

517
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:07,068
Scott: the US can just go ask the Bahamas hey that money whose money is that doesn't work.

518
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,510
Scott: that way Scott We'll blow up the Bahamas.

519
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:21,290
Rym: But the real reason people can get away with this bullshit is because the Republicans are basically preventing any reform saying that Reform of the tax code to prevent the loopholes is effectively raising taxes.

520
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:22,275
Scott: I got a new law.

521
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:24,023
Scott: you ready if you are in Congress.

522
00:29:24,485 --> 00:29:25,410
Scott: We take away all your money.

523
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,274
Scott: You're not allowed to have any money.

524
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:27,139
Rym: I got a new law ready.

525
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:27,440
Scott: You want it.

526
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:28,084
Scott: You want it ready.

527
00:29:28,245 --> 00:29:29,270
Scott: You ready carousel.

528
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:31,726
Scott: You want to be in charge of the government.

529
00:29:31,948 --> 00:29:34,202
Scott: well You're you know you want to do it so badly.

530
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:35,369
Scott: you want power no money.

531
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:36,574
Scott: Take away all.

532
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:38,120
Scott: you must have zero dollars.

533
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:41,879
Scott: the government will provide you with food and shelter Just like you're in the military.

534
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:42,101
Scott: some.

535
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:43,430
Scott: you'll be a public servant.

536
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:47,950
Rym: I somehow feel that there may be a more subtle and elegant way to achieve our end.

537
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:51,213
Scott: I think that works though you want to be a public servant there You're a public servant.

538
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:52,739
Scott: is anyone gonna.

539
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:55,610
Rym: Give up all their rights to be the mayor of Podunk, Iowa?

540
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,687
Scott: We're talking about Congress federal Congress.

541
00:29:57,748 --> 00:29:58,010
Scott: alright.

542
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:05,334
Rym: So the super-rich people control all the non federal Congress's and effectively then control the country The state Congress people.

543
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:08,565
Scott: they get exactly X dollars, or they live the local night.

544
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:09,970
Rym: Where do you where do you set X Scott?

545
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:16,738
Rym: You realize if you minimum wage No one can live on minimum wage.

546
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:19,250
Scott: they'll vote to graze the minimum wage real fast won't they?

547
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:30,335
Scott: All right, we can all get minimum wage here right minimum wage boom a million dollars a year says yes minimum wage There you go solved.

548
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:37,561
Rym: and of course before we get to the main coverage the meta moment We will be at anime Boston April 22nd 23rd and 24th.

549
00:30:37,982 --> 00:30:41,494
Rym: not next weekend, but that well not this weekend But next weekend.

550
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:42,057
Scott: Yes.

551
00:30:42,518 --> 00:30:44,787
Rym: We will be there doing I think four.

552
00:30:44,868 --> 00:30:46,720
Scott: so panels I don't know which panels are doing.

553
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,050
Scott: we're supposed to get the itinerary today.

554
00:30:49,255 --> 00:30:50,018
Rym: I've had it for a while.

555
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:51,504
Rym: I just haven't really shared.

556
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:52,327
Scott: I know some of them.

557
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:52,970
Scott: I just forget.

558
00:30:53,091 --> 00:31:00,070
Rym: I'm pretty sure we're doing the hotter on a panel panel because yeah We're definitely doing that one because there was a. you know we did it as a throwaway panel last year.

559
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,750
Scott: Well, it's actually surprisingly fun to do even though we didn't know we were doing it till we showed up.

560
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,236
Rym: Well, I was also pleased that it.

561
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,361
Rym: we thought it was the throwaway.

562
00:31:06,421 --> 00:31:08,390
Rym: right we walk into the room rooms packed.

563
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:09,742
Scott: It wasn't packed, but it was well.

564
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:10,670
Scott: No no there are a lot of people.

565
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:12,209
Rym: It was packed, but it was a tiny room.

566
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:13,354
Scott: It wasn't completely.

567
00:31:13,394 --> 00:31:20,800
Scott: it was packed for first panel ever on Friday morning immediately as the con starts And it was in that itty-bitty little room like way around.

568
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,687
Scott: It was surprisingly fun to do

569
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:22,787
Rym: yeah

570
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:26,182
Scott: And without any preparation it went well especially

571
00:31:26,223 --> 00:31:27,147
Rym: because I'm happy

572
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:27,730
Scott: to do it again

573
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:36,398
Rym: Especially talking about all the things that people do poorly in panels and then watching people who are at that panel at other panels Noticing those things as gold.

574
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:38,007
Scott: we should do it at Kinetic Con at 6 a.m.

575
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:41,900
Scott: Right before the con starts is mandatory for all other panelists.

576
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:45,050
Rym: and whoo a panelist, huh?

577
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:52,556
Scott: All panelists must be at the con at this time must attend one of these sessions for dick punchings Or you can't.

578
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:59,187
Rym: we're just gonna cancel your panels all right, so anyway We're definitely doing anime openers from around the world new and revised.

579
00:31:59,428 --> 00:32:06,129
Scott: Oh snap We're doing Scott's who is Hatsune Miku panel, which is actually dated technology, but not really revised.

580
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:09,504
Rym: yes But it's a panel that I think anime fans need to see.

581
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:10,750
Scott: it's in big room.

582
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,212
Scott: I checked.

583
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:14,310
Scott: yeah, it's a big room at a big time, and it's a different color on the schedule.

584
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,779
Rym: Oh, well cuz you know why it's a different color.

585
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,867
Rym: We're not just panelists at anime Boston.

586
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:20,930
Rym: We are preferred panelists.

587
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:24,988
Rym: We're not guests we're not Vic.

588
00:32:28,453 --> 00:32:31,270
Rym: So yes anime Boston we will be there, I think we're doing another panel.

589
00:32:32,353 --> 00:32:34,466
Rym: My tool Derral Strad anime world order.

590
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,050
Rym: they'll all be there.

591
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:43,280
Scott: There's enough panels done by either us or people close to us or our friends that you could go to just those panels and probably Fill the whole weekend with awesomeness.

592
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:48,103
Rym: if you want to say hi to us We've had a lot of fans coming up to us at cons, and it's great.

593
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:52,270
Rym: the only word of advice I have is that don't try to talk to us after a panel.

594
00:32:52,832 --> 00:33:01,969
Rym: That's pretty much the absolute worst time to talk to us cuz you have to leave the room because someone else is coming in the And usually we go to dinner right after our panels no matter when they are.

595
00:33:02,432 --> 00:33:05,393
Scott: So dinner right after the first panel on Friday morning Maybe lunch.

596
00:33:05,794 --> 00:33:09,390
Rym: so if you want to talk to us come to the tabletop gaming area.

597
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:22,045
Rym: And if we're not there And we're not doing a panel and we're not at one of Derral's panels or one of Mike's panels one of Gerald's panels one Of Clarissa's panels then what we're gonna be at is probably the lobby of our hotel playing games

598
00:33:22,306 --> 00:33:23,349
Scott: or dinner or dinner.

599
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:27,808
Rym: But yeah, if you find us we might tell you where the good secret breakfast is.

600
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:29,398
Rym: no We're not gonna say it on the show.

601
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:31,470
Scott: I'll tell you to go to the Neptune to try it in cafe.

602
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:31,811
Scott: That's right.

603
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:35,181
Rym: in cafe is pretty much the second best breakfast in Boston.

604
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:35,583
Scott: That's right.

605
00:33:35,623 --> 00:33:37,348
Scott: That's the non secret best breakfast.

606
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:37,910
Scott: It's all great.

607
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:41,915
Scott: It's fantastic amazing breakfast, so you should go to it, and we're not gonna Tell you where the secret breakfast is.

608
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:43,141
Scott: you know what and we won't get you know what.

609
00:33:43,462 --> 00:33:46,543
Rym: if you can beat me in advance wars I'll tell you where it is sure.

610
00:33:46,806 --> 00:33:52,199

612
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,736
Scott: I don't know, but we don't.

613
00:33:55,756 --> 00:33:57,202
Scott: we won't have a Megaman 2 available.

614
00:33:57,844 --> 00:34:04,970
Rym: Oh, huh funny that The GeekNights book club book is Foundation.

Scott: I bought the first three and the three separate volumes.

617
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:17,016
Scott: my parents have a hardcover for this old that has All three in one volume.

618
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,724
Scott: It's not actually that long volume one.

619
00:34:18,744 --> 00:34:20,030
Scott: This should be kind of easy.

620
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:23,541
Scott: It'll probably be in like right next month or two.

621
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:26,109
Scott: We'll do the book club because it's gonna be pretty soon.

622
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:33,190
Rym: Yep, in case you didn't notice registration for Pax Prime hotels already went up and all the good hotels are probably already sold out.

623
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,429
Rym: But if you hear this and you do not have your packs hotel, you should go get it right now.

00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:46,290
Scott: Where are you going to sleep?

629
00:34:47,112 --> 00:34:50,166

Scott: red lion 90% is good.

632
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,499
Rym: Red lion is I think my favorite.

633
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,067
Rym: non connected to the con hotel.

634
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:00,770
Rym: It's like right there.

635
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,836
Scott: There's only one connected to the con.

636
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:08,916
Rym: Yeah, but the red lion to be fair is you have to walk like that two blocks over But it's not far walk.

637
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:09,859
Rym: You'll be walking over there.

638
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:11,304
Rym: Anyway for the elephant castle.

639
00:35:11,324 --> 00:35:11,865
Scott: That's right.

640
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:13,310
Rym: I love that elephant castle.

641
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,113
Scott: It's pretty good place.

642
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:15,678
Rym: It's good like late night.

643
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:16,662
Rym: I'm tired.

644
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:17,003
Rym: food.

645
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:21,840
Scott: Yeah, I mean it, you know, it's typical It's it's basically like a Fridays but not Fridays.

646
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,290
Rym: It's the Boston equivalent of a Friday's Seattle.

647
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:26,136
Rym: Right, Seattle.

648
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,845
Rym: Yeah, right, right.

649
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:28,650
Scott: go to Boston next.

650
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:34,610
Scott: Yeah, go into Seattle in September and of course if you buy your book in your anime Boston hotel today godspeed.

651
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:37,899
Rym: Well, we know the dates for the next like ten years.

652
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,381
Scott: Yep.

653
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:40,067
Scott: That's I think that's definitely a cool move.

654
00:35:40,107 --> 00:35:47,030
Scott: on anime Boston You know realizing it's something that a lot of companies and other conventions and people in general need to realize is a lot of times.

655
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,281
Scott: there's no reason to keep the secret just for the sake of keeping a secret.

656
00:35:50,321 --> 00:35:56,441
Scott: if you have information and the information is finalized and There's not gonna be any harm by releasing the information.

657
00:35:56,481 --> 00:35:57,204
Scott: It can only help.

658
00:35:57,687 --> 00:35:58,350
Scott: you should release it.

659
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,192
Scott: You should be better.

660
00:35:59,232 --> 00:36:01,600
Scott: You should release as much information as possible.

661
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,763
Scott: Not as little as possible.

662
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:04,810
Rym: The information was hidden, right?

663
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:10,391
Rym: No, it wasn't because you could just figure it out if you went to the Boston like convention website, exactly There was.

664
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:11,677
Scott: no really it was already public.

665
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:12,541
Scott: It was just hidden public.

666
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:13,927
Scott: So I looked into this at least now.

667
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:17,444
Rym: right now I looked into this and Otakon still keeps it secret.

668
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:24,237
Rym: Uh I think it's pretty trivial to know when every Otakon will be Yeah from the BCC website.

669
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:26,465
Rym: also because we still have access to the staff site.

670
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:27,690
Scott: I don't have access to stuff.

671
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,572
Scott: So I still do.

672
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:29,394
Scott: I haven't tried.

673
00:36:29,475 --> 00:36:32,824
Rym: I'm listed as suspended but I can still log in and do everything.

674
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:33,445
Scott: All right.

675
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:34,428
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

676
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:39,650
Scott: anyway I don't even remember user name or password of our forums rocking.

677
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:42,180
Rym: It's kind of an ivory tower even a lot of new people joining.

678
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:43,225
Rym: I think you'll like it.

679
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:44,490
Rym: follow the gig night.

680
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,830
Scott: It's an ivory tower, but no elephants were harmed.

681
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:48,977
Rym: If you would like only mammoths.

682
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:53,070
Rym: get all the tweets of our old things of the day and old good episodes.

684
00:37:03,886 --> 00:37:08,722
Rym: but the beta is Just on our website all the way back to the beginning every single episode.

685
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:10,367
Scott: and after I get some other work done.

686
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:16,027
Scott: after anime Boston I'm working on some other websites that are almost done and then I'm gonna do some big upgrades.

687
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,729
Scott: different recruiter.

00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:31,829
Scott: We're just waiting for certain events to happen to coincide to get the timing right?

694
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:32,974
Rym: Yep And I think it's.

695
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:34,944
Scott: but those events are scheduled so it's.

696
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,614

Scott: It's something or sometime around early May.

703
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,238
Scott: Yeah, no first second week of May.

704
00:37:54,318 --> 00:38:01,079
Rym: astute people may be able to figure out what it is Not the first but for early May.

705
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,935
Rym: well on the 1st of May I'll have something else for everybody but Some outdoor fucking.

706
00:38:06,955 --> 00:38:11,230
Scott: perhaps I got something perhaps some half out the door fucking.

707
00:38:12,012 --> 00:38:17,911
Rym: But we are like it like out the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Arts Festival the mocha festival 2011.

708
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:19,178
Rym: We were there as we always are.

709
00:38:19,198 --> 00:38:21,009
Scott: how many mochas has this been in a row?

710
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:30,130
Scott: For us I Think I think I've been to the puck building three times and I think this is the third time at the.

711
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:33,499
Scott: I think at the armory, I think this is the depth.

712
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,389
Scott: This is definitely the third time at the armory at least.

713
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:39,680
Rym: Anyway, no, we also have a special guest.

714
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:42,490
Rym: Emily is on the show because she came with us to the mocha.

715
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,300
Emily: Yes, I figured it could be.

716
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:49,462
Emily: this could be the yearly Show that I'm on because I enjoy the indie comic.

717
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,350
Rym: It's also a good test of our technology.

718
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:53,309
Rym: We can actually have like eight people on the show.

719
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,010
Scott: Gaga also, you know we were gonna discuss pretty much.

720
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,330
Scott: All we're gonna talk about is the giant pile of comics that we have and we're doing it.

721
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,641
Rym: So I'm around.

722
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:06,927
Rym: usually, you know We go around and I interview like a hundred people and we have all those like just random interviews of like.

723
00:39:06,947 --> 00:39:07,470
Rym: this is my comic.

724
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:16,490
Rym: Yeah I didn't bring the Marantz partly because I was lazy and I wanted to just enjoy the mocha and Partly because I wanted to get some video instead and we'll do some video later.

725
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,380
Rym: But we're just gonna talk about all the comics we got.

726
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,510
Emily: it was kind of funny because one of our friends came over.

727
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:30,630
Emily: She had to tutor during the mocha And so she came over for dinner that night and she walked in the door and all our comics were spread out in the floor.

728
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,160
Emily: She's like, oh my god.

729
00:39:32,241 --> 00:39:33,630
Emily: How much did you guys spend?

730
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,559
Emily: Actually, it wasn't that much.

731
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,089
Emily: I've spent more in past years.

732
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:42,250
Rym: I spent less than a hundred dollars not knowing these surprisingly expensive but very awesome little miniature.

733
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:42,772
Rym: I didn't

734
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:48,812
Scott: actually count how much I spent but I definitely spent at least a hundred but other people spent more than me and other People like

735
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:54,369
Rym: credit our success and not spending money to the fact that by and large none of us bought anything We could just buy from a store.

736
00:39:56,438 --> 00:40:04,285
Emily: About a couple things From like, you know verticals website or something like that.

737
00:40:04,345 --> 00:40:05,730
Scott: I'm not vertical wasn't even there.

738
00:40:07,035 --> 00:40:12,274
Scott: Top shelf was yeah, it's like if it's top shelf Fantagraphics first.

739
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:14,283
Emily: second you can use it was there.

740
00:40:14,504 --> 00:40:24,157
Scott: it's weird because they're still indie publishers But at mocha they're big because they're the indie publishers and you think are Abrams, you know You can get their stuff

741
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:25,181
Emily: was there to where they

742
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:30,100
Scott: didn't see that but you can get their stuff on Amazon or you know from your comic book store usually.

743
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:37,070
Scott: so yeah, it's like why you know buying it at the mocha Doesn't really help you unless unless maybe the person is there and you wanted to sign it or something.

744
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,150
Emily: That's the thing if it's somebody who you're really a fan of.

745
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:46,850
Emily: I was this close to buying some Tov Janssen picture books some woman troll picture books But then I was like, no you can get that later.

746
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:53,150
Emily: You should buy zines that cost two dollars and are printed on a photocopy and you will never see again.

747
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:55,349
Scott: It's weird though cuz some of those you like I'll never see again.

748
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,478
Scott: But meanwhile you see them the next mocha they're there.

749
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:00,109
Scott: Yeah, if you want all of diary diaries, you can still get it.

750
00:41:00,972 --> 00:41:02,999
Rym: I couldn't find prison comics.

751
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,849
Emily: I couldn't get poor poor angsty Hungarian anymore.

752
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,693
Scott: That's another thing.

753
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:11,858
Scott: is that for example the the torpedo code booth Perhaps the most popular booth of the longest lines.

754
00:41:11,878 --> 00:41:15,333
Scott: or you can buy all that stuff at the pay to co comm even though it's Even.

755
00:41:15,394 --> 00:41:16,528
Scott: let you know you can't get it on it.

756
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:19,058
Rym: But Kate Beaton isn't going to sign your thing.

757
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:22,329
Scott: if you wait in line for like an hour the beaten path.

758
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:35,554
Emily: Every time I see her and there's a line forever I got to say I always feel bad for like the people who are next to the really successful Indie artists.

759
00:41:35,755 --> 00:41:36,458
Scott: Oh, it's like.

760
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:36,980
Scott: is it good?

761
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:37,784
Scott: or is it bad?

762
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:43,310
Emily: because happy at the line of Successful, but then everybody else it's ignore.

763
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:45,570
Scott: There's a line of people that is there's in front of you.

764
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:50,310
Scott: Then they'll probably look at your stuff while they're waiting but the foot traffic won't see you through the wall of people.

765
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:51,616
Rym: There's a secondary problem.

766
00:41:51,656 --> 00:42:07,376
Rym: I think the way because I saw some people or I did feel bad for them there was a popular thing next to them and the people were crowded around that not really in a line just in a big crowd and Those people would kind of glance at the table next to it and just immediately glance back and never give it a second look Because it wasn't that good.

767
00:42:07,396 --> 00:42:07,677
Scott: Yeah.

768
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:11,550
Scott: Well, you know you at the mocha really quality rules, right?

769
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:17,395
Scott: If you've got some if you're good at setting up a table with attractive stuff that catches the eye You're gonna do all right.

770
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:20,410
Rym: Did you notice there was necessarily quality rules?

771
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:30,227
Emily: Sometimes it's like it's got to be quality in a wide variety of spectrums Like if it's very interesting or it's really funny But poorly drawn or the dude is weird.

772
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:33,164
Emily: at the table It's like 50 cents and you put the money in the mr.

773
00:42:33,224 --> 00:42:34,310
Emily: T Bank or something.

774
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,200
Emily: You're gonna be interested in that that person.

775
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:49,413
Scott: plus there seems to be an explosion of things with anthropomorphized food Cute talking tiny robots of various sorts or What's the other thing?

776
00:42:49,454 --> 00:42:53,390
Scott: I saw a whole bunch of things that are related to just other geekeries in general, you know.

777
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:56,076
Rym: No ponies, though, though.

778
00:42:56,097 --> 00:43:01,273
Rym: I heard that a lot of people were asking for pony commissions of oh, you say there are no ponies But guess what?

779
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:03,602
Scott: I have some secret ponies secret ponies.

780
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,044
Scott: That's right.

781
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:06,936
Scott: In fact, I'll talk about this first Even though it's sort of riding.

782
00:43:06,956 --> 00:43:10,490
Rym: Well that our friend gave you that little rainbow - that's true.

783
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:12,590
Scott: I want to talk about this book, right?

784
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,753
Scott: This book is actually the probably the best thing I got at the mochas and we're riding the tallest roller coaster first But whatever right.

785
00:43:18,114 --> 00:43:22,047
Scott: so I saw this book called the 12 labors of gastrophobia by David Maguire.

786
00:43:22,107 --> 00:43:27,542
Scott: It was $12 Right, so this I bought this based because it looked cute.

787
00:43:27,783 --> 00:43:29,068
Scott: that's pretty much all I reason.

788
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:34,627
Scott: I bought it Right, and I read it last night and let me tell you this is fucking hysterical.

789
00:43:34,727 --> 00:43:35,350
Emily: I want to read it.

790
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:36,593
Emily: I was looking like

791
00:43:36,774 --> 00:43:57,688
Scott: I was lulling so much and what it's about is this Amazon who got pregnant but she doesn't know how her from who and She gets kicked out of Amazonia and So she's living in ancient Greece but it's mystical ancient Greece like this sphinxes that have and minotaurs and biclopses and all sorts of you know fantasy stuff.

792
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:06,902
Scott: and she has a son who's gastro and her name is phobia and They have wacky Adventures that are hilarious all over the place.

793
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:17,996
Scott: and there were my little ponies in this book Also cameos by a Kate Beaton pony and lots of other webcomics and all kind of Time-traveling and there's all sorts of stuff.

794
00:44:18,036 --> 00:44:20,806
Scott: and the best part is I found out this is a webcomic.

795
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:21,850
Emily: The arts really cute.

796
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:31,667
Scott: So I went to the website and like apparently this collects like the first 12 Labors, but now they're on like the second set of labors.

797
00:44:31,707 --> 00:44:34,149
Scott: on the website There's a whole bunch of them and it was so good.

798
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:38,550
Scott: I added it to my webcomics list because it was so hysterical, you know what that's referencing.

799
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:40,489
Scott: What do you mean neighbors?

800
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:45,084
Scott: No, oh, yeah, cuz it's Greek right?

801
00:44:45,104 --> 00:44:45,647
Scott: Yeah.

802
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:46,732
Scott: Yeah It's a whole.

803
00:44:47,114 --> 00:44:47,817
Scott: the thing is very.

804
00:44:47,897 --> 00:44:53,518
Scott: it's got a lot of Greek ness going on all over the place But it is also fantasy and humor.

805
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:54,541
Scott: Yeah, and a lot.

806
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:57,750
Scott: there's a lot of anachronisms as well all over the place.

807
00:44:58,293 --> 00:44:58,997
Rym: So I picked up.

808
00:44:59,320 --> 00:44:59,984
Rym: there was this guy.

809
00:45:00,004 --> 00:45:00,950
Rym: he had two little comics.

810
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:06,937
Rym: They had a much more but there one was called kanji for daily use and I got that one And the follow-up was flightless birds.

811
00:45:06,977 --> 00:45:10,834
Rym: now kanji for daily use is what sold me because it's this panda and it's like oh I'll learn.

812
00:45:10,854 --> 00:45:16,390
Rym: I thought it's a penguin But I just picked it up.

813
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,757
Rym: I think I picked it up from a table.

814
00:45:17,797 --> 00:45:20,673
Rym: that wasn't the artist cuz I saw it in multiple tables Really?

815
00:45:20,713 --> 00:45:20,915
Scott: I got.

816
00:45:21,036 --> 00:45:22,989
Rym: I saw a lot of stuff in multiple tables.

817
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:30,115
Scott: There were for example another thing that I got that was at multiple tables that pinball zine, but let's see Kanji for daily use.

818
00:45:30,135 --> 00:45:31,882
Rym: Let's see Akumu nightmare.

819
00:45:31,902 --> 00:45:33,027
Scott: That's not the first page.

820
00:45:33,127 --> 00:45:41,361
Rym: shippai Failure unrequited love unrequited alone regret alcohol.

821
00:45:43,632 --> 00:45:48,408
Scott: He tells a story in just single words, right and you know next to each it.

822
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:50,687
Scott: on the left You see the kanji and the and the.

823
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,037
Scott: you know The romangi and the translate and what it means.

824
00:45:53,077 --> 00:45:57,029
Scott: and on the right is an illustration and the illustrations in sequence tell a sad story.

825
00:45:58,093 --> 00:45:59,403
Emily: On the back, you know what it says.

826
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:00,190
Emily: I can see the back.

827
00:46:00,994 --> 00:46:03,004
Emily: Fuck you and the penguins like.

828
00:46:03,065 --> 00:46:04,050
Emily: that's not Japanese.

829
00:46:05,353 --> 00:46:09,810
Scott: And then in the bottom right you can is actually a little area where you can practice drawing the kanji.

830
00:46:10,091 --> 00:46:19,439
Emily: Yeah, but it's basically the story told through a textbook of a penguins Horrible crushing depression and failure at life.

831
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,809
Rym: I was impressed enough to pick up flightless birds, which was just an actual comic.

832
00:46:23,732 --> 00:46:25,539
Rym: And it's equally great.

833
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,510
Rym: It intersperses the sad penguin with Making penises in latte art.

834
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:44,585
Emily: Well, it's just about a any comic artist who lives in Brooklyn and sometimes she's really like kind of cynical in her Presentation of stuff but some of the stuff in the comic was kind of funny.

835
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:45,970
Rym: I was impressed.

836
00:46:46,031 --> 00:46:48,050
Rym: It was a fun little thing and it was definitely the price was right.

837
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,460
Rym: This is the kind of stuff that you won't see except at the mocha.

838
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:50,922
Emily: Yeah.

839
00:46:50,962 --> 00:46:51,283
Emily: Mm-hmm.

840
00:46:52,126 --> 00:46:54,476
Emily: And of course We had.

841
00:46:54,596 --> 00:46:56,890
Emily: we had to stop by the Scandinavian corner.

842
00:46:59,031 --> 00:47:00,297
Rym: I bought a bunch of stuff over there.

843
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,815
Emily: I think we hit every every Nordic country We have.

844
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:10,330
Emily: we got one from Finland We got one from Norway and the one from Norway was great because it had no dialogue.

845
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:13,240
Emily: It was you know, I was like no translation problem.

846
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,006
Emily: I know it was like does so?

847
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:16,010
Emily: does it have a paper?

848
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,857
Scott: It's like Tezuka's.

849
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:20,187
Scott: what's it called tales of a street corner?

850
00:47:20,248 --> 00:47:23,158
Emily: Yeah, and So that one was really cool.

851
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:24,102
Emily: I forget the name.

852
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:25,710
Emily: It was something about the canal.

853
00:47:26,731 --> 00:47:27,755
Rym: I got that one.

854
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:28,599
Rym: That's in my pile.

855
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:29,603
Rym: I will pull it out right now.

856
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:30,245
Rym: It was great.

857
00:47:30,507 --> 00:47:31,310
Rym: It was really cool.

858
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:39,090
Emily: It was den croquette canal in and don't don't eat and people don't hit us for our pronunciation by max Estes It's.

859
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:44,125
Rym: I don't even want to say anything about it because it's it's really good.

860
00:47:44,266 --> 00:47:48,922
Emily: It's it's like it's way spoilable spy thriller kind of thing.

861
00:47:48,942 --> 00:47:50,889
Rym: it's a spy drama with a dead drop.

862
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:56,738
Emily: and Well, it's all all told and very Stylized color.

863
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,188
Emily: No, no lines.

864
00:47:58,268 --> 00:48:06,989
Emily: Really It's it's mostly with light and shadow and like lots of blues and and night tone Lots of people getting hit by cars and things - yeah.

865
00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:10,076
Emily: And it has cats.

866
00:48:10,598 --> 00:48:18,449
Rym: it's great just for the end where there's a cop who's like what the fuck It's what goes on in the streets by the canal at night.

867
00:48:19,653 --> 00:48:25,267
Rym: I wish I could have a job where I'm paid by my government to go around the world promoting arts.

868
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:28,758
Scott: Oh my gosh Is that their full-time job?

869
00:48:28,898 --> 00:48:31,450
Rym: Oh, it's but there are but they are paid for that.

870
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:35,930
Rym: I mean, hey go to it's science for a week and tell people about GeekNights.

871
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:39,435
Emily: It's not completely.

872
00:48:39,455 --> 00:48:47,192
Emily: I I think it's not like they're paid by the government for everything but government sponsors it Exactly.

873
00:48:47,232 --> 00:48:59,638
Emily: the Scandinavian countries have much better endowments for the arts and grants and stuff and they do sponsor this trip to promote cultural exchange Through the arts, you know and the u.s.

874
00:48:59,658 --> 00:49:07,470
Emily: Has some programs like that, but not not nearly to the extent that That these other countries do and it's kind of a shame.

875
00:49:07,831 --> 00:49:16,348
Emily: But of course at the same time you look at taxes and they nobody wants to pay taxes here That many more taxes than we do.

876
00:49:17,972 --> 00:49:25,008
Emily: Nobody in the u.s If I was to say help me spread indie comics to the world All the Republicans and everything would be like.

877
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:30,312
Scott: well Mocha takes up one room for two days in a big city and you know It's like.

878
00:49:30,352 --> 00:49:33,387
Scott: and it's not that it's only crowded like later in the day.

879
00:49:33,648 --> 00:49:37,007
Scott: Yeah That's the amount of interest you're gonna get in this one part.

880
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:37,570
Scott: how much you know.

881
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,022
Scott: It's not like if you're in the.

882
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:40,030
Scott: you know, Northern Europe.

883
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:45,226
Scott: You got people normal people waiting in a huge line to see Don Rosa, right?

884
00:49:45,266 --> 00:49:46,490
Scott: It's a completely different situation.

885
00:49:46,711 --> 00:50:00,501
Rym: So at the same table, I picked up Otto non chalongelow little round dude who it's also a wordless one and it's just little four panels and He's kind of a dick and it's kind of funny in a way.

886
00:50:00,561 --> 00:50:09,208
Emily: It's kind of like the anti Ziggy, you know You know this little dude who's very like round and and fat and he goes around.

887
00:50:09,248 --> 00:50:09,890
Scott: he's round effect.

888
00:50:10,432 --> 00:50:11,376
Emily: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

889
00:50:11,457 --> 00:50:14,370
Emily: But he is kind of more not nice.

890
00:50:15,132 --> 00:50:16,936
Scott: Well, he's nice.

891
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:19,201
Scott: Ziggy's usually just completely boring.

892
00:50:19,302 --> 00:50:22,550
Emily: It's it's sappy and the other one is maybe not so sappy.

893
00:50:24,632 --> 00:50:26,145
Scott: Ziggy's pretty much his greeting cards.

894
00:50:26,186 --> 00:50:31,700
Emily: nowadays Ziggy actually come from overseas.

895
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,664
Emily: I don't know.

896
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:33,569
Scott: I don't know enough about it.

897
00:50:34,193 --> 00:50:43,372
Emily: Anyway, so at the Finland table I was happy too because I was able to recognize some of the Finnish publications and it was Kannurva.

898
00:50:43,753 --> 00:50:48,027
Emily: was Kannurva was the the one that Timo gave us.

899
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:48,810
Rym: Oh, yeah.

900
00:50:50,457 --> 00:50:52,707
Rym: And then all the people at the table were like, oh crap.

901
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:53,390
Rym: I know who that is.

902
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:56,484
Emily: Oh, I was too embarrassed to say anything in Finnish.

903
00:50:56,564 --> 00:51:00,417
Emily: besides my finish is really bad But we got Batuman.

904
00:51:00,437 --> 00:51:07,688
Emily: Batuman is pretty great and we got a free comics newspaper Which had like a bunch of samplings of like.

905
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:09,157
Scott: oh, yeah They had a big stack that was.

906
00:51:09,177 --> 00:51:09,922
Scott: that was something I saw.

907
00:51:10,002 --> 00:51:19,863
Scott: more this year than ever was Things that were printed on newsprint that were big and I think I don't know if Wednesday comics which did come out Between these two mochas had any sort of influence on that, right?

908
00:51:19,883 --> 00:51:21,650
Scott: You know the newsprint format.

909
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:31,970
Emily: This was like a collaboration between a Chicago Independent comic Collective and a Finnish independent comic collective and so it's kind of cool.

910
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:32,893
Emily: It was like half and a half.

911
00:51:33,314 --> 00:51:34,558
Emily: but Batuman is.

912
00:51:34,578 --> 00:51:43,170
Emily: this is a first issue called the sad issue and it's Adventures of the Batuman including bad friends hipsters and other depressing things.

913
00:51:43,712 --> 00:51:57,490
Emily: It's basically, you know, it's Batman and he he the arts very cute is little Two-tone green and green and black and it's just Batman comes over to talk to Catwoman about stuff.

914
00:51:57,591 --> 00:51:58,448
Emily: Cuz he's depressed.

915
00:51:59,732 --> 00:52:05,030
Rym: So I thought they could only have sex in this in the space between the top of the Batpole and the bottom.

916
00:52:06,931 --> 00:52:18,189
Scott: Anyway, so next to the the Scandinavian comic table right a little bit to the left was this this new NYU table Right, which was representing like this one group of this one major at NYU.

917
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:21,830
Scott: I forget what the majors called but basically it's like a pretty awesome major.

918
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:23,890
Scott: I kind of wish I would have done it or would have existed.

919
00:52:24,314 --> 00:52:26,170
Scott: We're like you do all sorts of crazy stuff.

920
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:33,990
Scott: Like I heard this major people would like make video make, you know, quote video games using like asterisk servers and payphones.

921
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:34,613
Scott: Yeah, it's.

922
00:52:34,733 --> 00:52:39,267
Emily: it's like it's the new program at Tisch and it's like information.

923
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:43,390
Scott: It's like technology and art in the same major basically, right?

924
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:48,990
Scott: So they had this little comic that caught my eye because it was about Arduinos and basically all it is a little informational pamphlet.

925
00:52:49,272 --> 00:52:52,128
Scott: That's also a comic that tells you what an Arduino is all about if you don't know.

926
00:52:53,052 --> 00:53:03,501
Scott: Which is what caught my eye and I bought just bought that because but the thing that was really amazing at the table or something You couldn't buy which is sort of like they were just showing off the students work I think trying to convince people to you know, go to school.

927
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:05,450
Rym: that was burned by that over at the SVA table.

928
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:06,717
Rym: I was like, ooh, can I buy that?

929
00:53:06,737 --> 00:53:07,380
Rym: and they're like now?

930
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:10,036
Scott: Yeah, but they had all these pop-up books The students had made.

931
00:53:10,177 --> 00:53:12,009
Rym: Oh, I got a bunch of video those pop-up books.

932
00:53:12,191 --> 00:53:14,510
Scott: It was like it was the Dune one, right?

933
00:53:15,412 --> 00:53:16,819
Scott: There was one that was better than that.

934
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:21,021
Scott: Oh, I did doom doom Which is the best one.

935
00:53:21,383 --> 00:53:22,229
Scott: and then they had dune.

936
00:53:22,852 --> 00:53:23,956
Scott: But the doom one was just.

937
00:53:23,976 --> 00:53:25,020
Scott: I was so awesome.

938
00:53:25,061 --> 00:53:27,269
Scott: you open up and it's like the cyber demons in there.

939
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:29,273
Scott: It's like That was.

940
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:31,386
Rym: those are gonna love the art of a pop-up book.

941
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:33,377
Scott: Yeah But yeah, that was.

942
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:34,606
Scott: that was a high quality table.

943
00:53:35,414 --> 00:53:37,714
Scott: I mean if I could go back in time That's what I would major in.

944
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:41,568
Emily: I see a lot of schools doing the advertising there SVA in particular.

945
00:53:41,608 --> 00:53:44,259
Scott: you get well Half the frickin tables are SVA students.

946
00:53:44,279 --> 00:53:44,801
Scott: I know right?

947
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,810
Emily: It's that's how I feel at my job.

948
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:51,710
Emily: It's like every other animator I meet their SVA and the quality of work that comes out.

949
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:54,399
Emily: There's a high quality pretty high caliber.

950
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,870
Emily: So I guess I don't think I've ever been SVA as an art school.

951
00:53:57,951 --> 00:53:58,336
Scott: I've never.

952
00:53:58,397 --> 00:53:59,369
Scott: well, I think what it is.

953
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:04,449
Scott: I think part of it is you can't get in unless you're already good and I think part of it is that's just a really Good school also.

954
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:09,890
Scott: So it's like you add the two together and I've never met someone who went to SVA who does not have mad art skills.

955
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:17,030
Emily: You know, or at least or at least some potential there, you know, of course, maybe they hide all that.

956
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,897
Rym: I I saw they don't bring them to the mocha.

957
00:54:19,198 --> 00:54:21,487
Emily: I saw some pretty bad like at their.

958
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:26,710
Emily: at the I get all the inside dirt from my my co-workers.

959
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:30,983
Emily: But I saw a couple real stinkers in terms of computer animation.

960
00:54:31,484 --> 00:54:33,330
Emily: those don't get put on the school demo.

961
00:54:35,554 --> 00:54:38,230
Rym: Actually kind of a random aside, but did you guys notice that this year?

962
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:44,770
Rym: I think more so than other years there was a surprising amount of price disparities for similar works at different tables.

963
00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:48,130
Rym: Yeah, like I saw like I got I picked up this little comic.

964
00:54:48,210 --> 00:55:06,430
Rym: it was like 50 cents monster country just a cute little thing about Monster girl who eats legendary magical monsters to get their powers and it's kind of like curbing Like a lot just a little bit of asshole Astro boy, but in a different direction like more towards layers.

965
00:55:06,914 --> 00:55:08,588
Rym: But it was like 50 cents or a dollar.

966
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:12,163
Rym: Similar quality works were at other tables that I looked at my goo.

967
00:55:12,203 --> 00:55:13,909
Rym: This is great and the guys like yeah seven bucks.

968
00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:17,600
Rym: I'm like seven bucks for a thing that you photocopied and stapled together.

969
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,523
Scott: Yeah, it's like you're shitting me.

970
00:55:19,105 --> 00:55:25,830
Emily: I I usually Went for like the $2 ones if it was like more than five and it was just a monotone.

971
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:36,390
Scott: Yeah, the way I see it the way I see it Right, is that an actual comic book in the shitty floppy monthly format from Marvel or DC is three dollars, right?

972
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:41,998
Scott: So if you're gonna charge me and that's overpriced as far as I'm concerned now I'm gonna charge me three dollars.

973
00:55:42,158 --> 00:55:45,090
Scott: It's got to be at least as good as an actual comic book.

974
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:51,863
Rym: Like if it's really great, I'll pay more for it, especially if it is still really Indian I'm not gonna find it or if you're bundling them together or via a lot of pages.

975
00:55:51,903 --> 00:55:54,618
Scott: Yeah Something like that.

976
00:55:55,242 --> 00:55:56,450
Scott: or for example, right?

977
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,157
Scott: I got this.

978
00:55:57,622 --> 00:55:58,168
Scott: this you know.

979
00:55:58,812 --> 00:56:03,410
Scott: What they did is this reminds me of the stuff that we've seen from the enforcer land.

980
00:56:03,831 --> 00:56:09,510
Scott: Basically they took a Batman the Brave and the Bold coloring book, right and they photocopied it straight up complete.

981
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,854
Scott: They didn't give a shit really.

982
00:56:10,894 --> 00:56:16,881
Scott: and then they went all over it and they changed it from Batman the Brave and the Bold to thrift store.

983
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:19,356
Rym: Batman Sounds pretty good.

984
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:21,286
Scott: Actually thrift store Batman come quick.

985
00:56:21,306 --> 00:56:22,090
Scott: They're having a sale.

986
00:56:26,293 --> 00:56:27,981
Scott: One more buy one get one free.

987
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:29,830
Scott: Oh, yeah Scandinavian comments.

988
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:32,478
Rym: Yep, it was a Danish one and we take.

989
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,025
Rym: the guy was telling us a lot about Danish comics.

990
00:56:34,065 --> 00:56:35,190
Rym: very short very few words.

991
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:39,161
Rym: The Man of Glass by Martin Flink and it's about a boxer.

992
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:40,806
Rym: it involves a boxer.

993
00:56:41,408 --> 00:56:42,270
Emily: It's really sad.

994
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:45,400
Emily: It could be like what's really good movie or something.

995
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:46,063
Emily: It would be.

996
00:56:46,384 --> 00:56:48,210
Rym: it is really good like movie short.

997
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:52,850
Scott: They're already a bunch of movies that are just about a boxing and a guy's made of glass.

998
00:56:53,472 --> 00:56:55,037
Rym: This guy is not made.

999
00:56:55,117 --> 00:56:58,770
Rym: Well, it was more about one's heart than about the actual body.

1000
00:56:59,011 --> 00:57:02,802
Rym: It's told very well in a just alternating between present past and future.

1001
00:57:03,063 --> 00:57:05,250
Emily: Yeah, this is another wordless one.

1002
00:57:05,431 --> 00:57:05,833
Emily: See it.

1003
00:57:05,853 --> 00:57:06,557
Rym: There's a few words.

1004
00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:08,889
Emily: There's a few words, but it's really.

1005
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:14,310
Emily: You know, most of the stuff gets across without any translation or anything.

1006
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,035
Rym: So it's actually another.

1007
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:16,395
Rym: look through.

1008
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:21,790
Rym: there are no words really except for one tiny scene until the kind of the moral at the end.

1009
00:57:22,951 --> 00:57:27,950
Emily: Yeah, so I'm just gonna go through a quick a few of my my $2 selections.

1010
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:37,430
Emily: For example, I got a very helpful guide to Gaga Because I am not gonna lie as in eight people or as in lady as in lady with the magic.

1011
00:57:37,832 --> 00:57:39,279
Scott: It's like a biography or what?

1012
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:44,538
Emily: No, this is a Dissection of the music videos.

1013
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:46,323
Emily: Okay, and it's here.

1014
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:51,836
Emily: I was having Judith laugh and laugh cuz I was reading her Excerpts and it's illustrated right?

1015
00:57:52,357 --> 00:57:53,360
Emily: So telephone.

1016
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:56,330
Emily: Gaga is not actually in a club nor is she sipping that bub.

1017
00:57:56,451 --> 00:57:57,849
Emily: She is in prison for bitches.

1018
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:03,930
Emily: It is a rather sleazy place but Gaga digs it babe because she gets to make out with hot muscle dykes and watch lady fights.

1019
00:58:10,832 --> 00:58:12,920
Rym: I feel like this cover is kind of the same.

1020
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:14,888
Emily: I got a surprise bailout on a telephone.

1021
00:58:14,928 --> 00:58:15,370
Emily: I see well.

1022
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:19,305
Emily: Oh, well, she decides to celebrate anywhere by underwear dancing.

1023
00:58:19,325 --> 00:58:23,308
Rym: I Think that will serve the same purpose that the literal music videos do.

1024
00:58:23,348 --> 00:58:34,870
Emily: for me It's really funny because it's it's they just go through Shot by shot her more popular music videos and kind of highlight how crazy they are.

1025
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:40,327
Emily: You know Gaga is straight chillin with her in with her house when she has this crazy vision.

1026
00:58:40,588 --> 00:58:47,530
Emily: Oh shoot She was born a freaky monster born from a bathhouse pod unapologetic queen of the pod monsters.

1027
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,276
Emily: So it's just got little pictures to Show Lady Gaga.

1028
00:58:53,537 --> 00:58:55,223
Rym: we picked up this really little remember last year.

1029
00:58:55,263 --> 00:58:59,025
Rym: We talked about that the sugar spiders 24-hour comics.

1030
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:11,450
Rym: so good Well, it was by Ira Rothwell and she was there again and she had a whole another 24-hour comic like this little water color Ething and it was pretty great Mm-hmm, and I got one called flashlight.

1031
00:59:11,711 --> 00:59:16,203
Emily: It's in full color by Megan bear and it's about kids.

1032
00:59:16,544 --> 00:59:18,690
Emily: Oh, actually the interior is not in full color.

1033
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:23,819
Emily: I lied But they go down and Explore an abandoned subway track.

1034
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:26,830
Emily: It's all about urban exploration with a flashlight.

1035
00:59:28,012 --> 00:59:30,043
Emily: And I got one about sisters.

1036
00:59:30,163 --> 00:59:31,410
Emily: go into the ice cream truck.

1037
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:41,250
Emily: And one of the main reasons I got that is because the girls were really cute when they were selling it and they had these Little buttons where if you bought the comic they'd give you your favorite ice cream on a button.

1038
00:59:41,634 --> 00:59:43,089
Scott: And so they only had a few choices.

1039
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:50,190
Emily: They made you choose like the girls in the comic should I get a rocket pop or should I get the chocolate eclair pop.

1040
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:51,941
Emily: or Should I get ice cream sandwich?

1041
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:59,160
Emily: Yeah, the ice cream sandwich Make the Decision like the girls are in the comic, but it was.

1042
00:59:59,461 --> 01:00:02,150
Emily: it was just really cute and very relatable as you know.

1043
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:07,468
Emily: growing up in in the suburbs and getting ice cream with my sis, so there's that.

1044
01:00:07,489 --> 01:00:10,265
Emily: and And what's somebody?

1045
01:00:10,286 --> 01:00:14,125
Rym: oh Yeah, this is just a direct retelling of Swan Lake.

1046
01:00:14,226 --> 01:00:15,110
Scott: Oh really give me that shit.

1047
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:29,624
Rym: It's really big format - and a lot of the faces room very reminiscent of But just the way like the boat when the swans are bored kind of just regarding the guy.

1048
01:00:29,825 --> 01:00:31,912
Rym: that just that's a very Kate beaten Face right there.

1049
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:34,802
Rym: there the eyes are but yeah, I can see it's just a straight retelling.

1050
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:36,830
Rym: That's actually very artful very good.

1051
01:00:37,351 --> 01:00:38,334
Rym: Well the story is very sad.

1052
01:00:38,394 --> 01:00:38,896
Emily: Yeah, I know.

1053
01:00:39,257 --> 01:00:46,230
Emily: and then you got another retelling of a folktale with animal transformation But not quite as seriously.

1054
01:00:48,492 --> 01:00:50,098
Emily: It's called derp the comic.

1055
01:00:50,419 --> 01:00:52,628
Scott: oh, all right because it was because it was called derp.

1056
01:00:52,668 --> 01:00:56,661
Emily: you bought it Derp and then it was.

1057
01:00:57,366 --> 01:01:04,770
Emily: it's the The frog Tsarina story from Russia where there's the enchanted frog and she turns into princess.

1058
01:01:05,092 --> 01:01:07,369
Rym: It's like you have to marry the frog cuz that's what happens.

1059
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:25,190
Scott: Anyway, so I got this comic who is Amy amoeba And I bought it because it was an amoeba on the cover, and I was like alright Whatever it actually was a story about the amoeba who splits in half right and then it's like I'm Amy amoeba.

1060
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:27,216
Scott: No, I'm Amy amoeba right.

1061
01:01:27,597 --> 01:01:35,990
Scott: and then as time goes on you know the it's it's all it gets like really philosophy Philosophical like you know and they they like when there's so many amoebas.

1062
01:01:36,051 --> 01:01:40,243
Scott: It's like they want to worship Amy amoeba But they're like which one's the original one and one of them claims to be that.

1063
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:40,685
Scott: you know it's.

1064
01:01:41,067 --> 01:01:43,821
Scott: it got really Philosophical is actually quite surprising.

1065
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:47,918
Scott: for a tiny little comic here I got this thing that was just.

1066
01:01:48,058 --> 01:01:55,259
Scott: it's basically like a few pieces of paper from you know stapled together Called no gods no kings only cheeseburgers.

1067
01:01:55,319 --> 01:02:12,184
Scott: It's from Michael Clayton at Michael Clayton illustration calm and You know I mean, it's just pretty much like black and white sort of just little you know But a mixed up bunch of comics that aren't really related to each other, but they were actually really hilarious Especially this one about spider-man.

1068
01:02:12,204 --> 01:02:18,979
Scott: when he gets a boner It's like spider-man takes down gang while holding book.

1069
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:20,925
Scott: I didn't want to lose the book.

1070
01:02:20,965 --> 01:02:41,426
Scott: That's why I kept it so close to me I Got this thing called poop toast because it was called poop toast and it's about a piece of toast with poop on its head Aside from the cute little robots.

1071
01:02:41,526 --> 01:02:42,830
Emily: toast is toast.

1072
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:46,400
Emily: I saw like at least four different comics that were like something something toast.

1073
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,193
Emily: I was like what's with this hipster fascination with toast.

1074
01:02:49,334 --> 01:02:50,680
Rym: Yeah, I saw two hero.

1075
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:55,938
Scott: I saw one comic that was about actual lettuce and another comic that had a character named lettuce.

1076
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:56,540
Scott: That was a rabbit.

1077
01:02:57,822 --> 01:03:00,129
Emily: No, no there was a third one with lettuce.

1078
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,380
Emily: Yeah, there was one called lettuce girl, and but it was about it.

1079
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,996
Scott: That's the dentist the one with actual lettuce.

1080
01:03:05,016 --> 01:03:08,789
Emily: oh Was it actually like she?

1081
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:10,816
Emily: but it's not anthropomorphic leathers.

1082
01:03:10,936 --> 01:03:11,840
Scott: No I guess not.

1083
01:03:14,103 --> 01:03:17,800
Scott: But yeah poop toast is about a piece of toast with poop on its head and there were actually three parts.

1084
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:18,931
Scott: But you know what it's not done.

1085
01:03:18,972 --> 01:03:26,635
Scott: at the end of the day He actually is a continuing series and at the end of the third part It was like they got arrested, and then it was like to be continued.

1086
01:03:26,675 --> 01:03:27,519
Scott: I'm like are you shitting me?

1087
01:03:30,882 --> 01:03:33,111
Emily: Which was my favorite from the mocha last year?

1088
01:03:33,212 --> 01:03:33,613
Scott: and what?

1089
01:03:33,674 --> 01:03:34,638
Scott: what is up with?

1090
01:03:34,698 --> 01:03:41,883
Scott: like Like earthworms always being a sidekick of some sort right like Ollie or Richard scary You know.

1091
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:42,788
Scott: or and then this.

1092
01:03:42,888 --> 01:03:50,940
Emily: it's like the earthworm is always the sidekick character Because you can make him cute, but you can't make him quite expressive enough to qualify for main character.

1093
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:51,384
Scott: I don't know.

1094
01:03:51,425 --> 01:03:52,940
Scott: I think we need something about a worm.

1095
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:56,400
Scott: He's not a but these are like he's like.

1096
01:03:56,822 --> 01:03:58,850
Scott: You know earthworm Jim is a lot more going on.

1097
01:03:58,910 --> 01:03:59,030
Rym: No.

1098
01:03:59,071 --> 01:04:00,115
Rym: He's an actual earthworm.

1099
01:04:00,135 --> 01:04:01,300
Rym: He just happened to find a suit.

1100
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:03,065
Scott: Anyway, I bought this.

1101
01:04:03,165 --> 01:04:04,490
Scott: it was called the three little gamers.

1102
01:04:04,551 --> 01:04:06,720
Scott: I got it cuz it was called the three little gamers.

1103
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:09,525
Scott: Yeah, it's basically.

1104
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:11,894
Scott: it seems like sort of one of those things.

1105
01:04:11,934 --> 01:04:15,064
Scott: they tell the stories of their own nerdiness you know.

1106
01:04:15,124 --> 01:04:16,007
Scott: and one guy's.

1107
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:24,003
Scott: you know two guys think they're cooler than the other guy because he's a boffo weapon guy but they're video game guys and It's by.

1108
01:04:24,043 --> 01:04:28,897
Scott: let's see Maggie Siegel barely combo game fanboys calm.

1109
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:30,444
Scott: March 2011.

1110
01:04:30,444 --> 01:04:40,000
Scott: I got something called similarly called controller And I bought that because the design of it is that the packaging of the comic was in an NES sleeve.

1111
01:04:40,121 --> 01:04:43,505
Scott: It looked the comic looks like an NES cartridge And it comes with a paper.

1112
01:04:43,867 --> 01:04:46,839
Scott: well construction paper NES sleeve to put it in.

1113
01:04:48,022 --> 01:04:50,213
Scott: Comic itself you know wasn't that exciting.

1114
01:04:50,273 --> 01:05:04,420
Scott: it was basically like You know remembering you know childhood and stuff like that and a guy Sort of being upset that he's like a big-time video game collector But doesn't really play video games anymore, and I wasn't that exciting.

1115
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:07,920
Scott: But the packaging was too cool to not pass to not purchase.

1116
01:05:08,382 --> 01:05:09,205
Rym: I picked up this little.

1117
01:05:09,245 --> 01:05:12,680
Rym: it was a hardcover book of Japanese monsters of the bento bestiary.

1118
01:05:13,106 --> 01:05:14,100
Rym: Oh, that looks so awesome.

1119
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,456
Rym: It got points because it had really good art and also really good text.

1120
01:05:17,476 --> 01:05:20,669
Rym: like there's a little Story from the perspective of each monster.

1121
01:05:20,689 --> 01:05:21,934
Rym: I think my favorite one.

1122
01:05:22,014 --> 01:05:23,158
Emily: I didn't know about.

1123
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,011
Scott: yeah I didn't know about the big bestiary fan.

1124
01:05:26,132 --> 01:05:26,373
Rym: the one.

1125
01:05:26,393 --> 01:05:27,820
Rym: I really like was the one Yoda.

1126
01:05:28,504 --> 01:05:29,067
Scott: What does he do?

1127
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:31,020
Rym: he rolls you to hell?

1128
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,446
Scott: He's a flaming wheel jigoku.

1129
01:05:33,627 --> 01:05:38,180
Rym: He's a burning wheel, but I really I think my favorite one is the Umi bozo.

1130
01:05:39,521 --> 01:05:44,950
Rym: He's really cute like a giant sea monster and the text is the fishermen always want to play the same game But I don't mind.

1131
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:48,900
Rym: first I'll pop up from under the sea and make the biggest of big waves.

1132
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:53,440
Rym: Then they'll scream because they're so happy and they'll make the boat move really quick.

1133
01:05:53,922 --> 01:05:59,772
Rym: Then there's usually some splashing and I roar and laugh and a bit later They get really tired and they go into the sea for a sleep.

1134
01:05:59,993 --> 01:06:01,340
Rym: They must get tired really easy.

1135
01:06:02,765 --> 01:06:03,798
Rym: And he's just really cute.

1136
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:13,648
Emily: Whales or weird kind of tsunami Effects or something.

1137
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:20,098
Emily: I'm being a whale at the same time No, but it's like it was basically like this big water that would it's baby swamps.

1138
01:06:20,198 --> 01:06:24,805
Emily: Okay Come up under the boat and be like blue Get almost she.

1139
01:06:24,825 --> 01:06:27,457
Scott: she there at the baby swamps, you know, it would.

1140
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:28,160
Emily: it would be weird.

1141
01:06:28,501 --> 01:06:32,878
Emily: I like the the person who was like a cad I forget.

1142
01:06:33,139 --> 01:06:51,239
Emily: anyway moving on I got a. you know my pick of the cute robot thing was actually this kind of sad and melancholic little comic called heaven all day and it's about the story of an inventor and a homeless robot.

1143
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:55,031
Emily: and Well, their paths do not directly cross.

1144
01:06:55,231 --> 01:07:02,080
Emily: it's about the effects that you know Someone unrelated can have on somebody else's life, I guess.

1145
01:07:03,721 --> 01:07:05,069
Emily: But it's you know.

1146
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:11,496
Emily: judging from the cover I thought it was going to be more of a light-hearted thing, but it was actually.

1147
01:07:11,577 --> 01:07:13,104
Emily: it was very good But it was.

1148
01:07:13,245 --> 01:07:14,072
Emily: it was kind of sad.

1149
01:07:14,092 --> 01:07:19,720
Scott: Mm-hmm I bought this thing just because it seemed pretty cool and because you know, there were so many robots going on.

1150
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:20,024
Scott: I was like.

1151
01:07:20,044 --> 01:07:21,100
Scott: you will not tempt me with robots.

1152
01:07:21,201 --> 01:07:23,740
Scott: I'm gonna go classic and reward the person who has a dragon.

1153
01:07:24,302 --> 01:07:26,995
Scott: So this thing it was a little tiny book and it said you stupid dragon.

1154
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:28,120
Emily: Oh, I love that.

1155
01:07:29,362 --> 01:07:34,684
Scott: Right, so it's like it's a book and you flip the page and as you turn the pages you're following There's a big.

1156
01:07:34,724 --> 01:07:43,220
Scott: it's a big long green dragon And as you turn the pages you're following, you know, the this dragon and there's all this sort of weird stuff all around him.

1157
01:07:43,441 --> 01:07:46,680
Rym: I love that style of you know children's books often had themes like that.

1158
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:50,853
Scott: Yeah, and basically you get to the end and then you get to the beginning again.

1159
01:07:50,873 --> 01:07:54,180
Scott: and the thing it's really cool If you actually unfold it.

1160
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,284
Scott: You'll see how he made it is.

1161
01:07:55,304 --> 01:08:03,536
Scott: he drew this big dragon on one big piece of paper and then cut it in a clever Way so that it folds into a book where you can turn the pages and follow the dragon.

1162
01:08:03,636 --> 01:08:04,479
Scott: It's it's pretty fun.

1163
01:08:05,741 --> 01:08:07,126
Scott: I also got these two things.

1164
01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:09,012
Scott: It's a it's a pinball zine.

1165
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:11,400
Scott: These guys are starting and it was at two different tables.

1166
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:23,952
Rym: I think I said that already because one of the guys at one table one of the guys at another table and I just remember the guy at the table at the time was dressed somewhat hipster ish Mm-hmm, and where I was like tell me about your deal.

1167
01:08:24,013 --> 01:08:25,599
Rym: and he's like he was like.

1168
01:08:27,082 --> 01:08:29,068
Rym: So we start talking and he's like man.

1169
01:08:29,349 --> 01:08:30,372
Rym: you want to play some pinball.

1170
01:08:30,393 --> 01:08:31,657
Rym: There's this place in Brooklyn.

1171
01:08:31,676 --> 01:08:32,600
Rym: You've probably never heard of it.

1172
01:08:32,701 --> 01:08:45,180
Scott: It's near Williamsburg But I do want to go check out that pinball, yeah Yeah, but anyway I started reading the first pinball zine and it's pretty good because it starts out for like complete beginners.

1173
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:52,140
Scott: Like it tells you what all the parts of the pinball machine are and how they work And then it gets into some history stuff and both of these zines.

1174
01:08:52,140 --> 01:09:01,479
Scott: They actually have a lot of content in them for being the you know These small sort of inexpensively printed books and each one has a full-color design of a non-existent pinball table.

1175
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:06,925
Scott: The first one has a quidditch Harry Potter pinball table, which I don't care about Harry Potter But it looks like a good table.

1176
01:09:07,265 --> 01:09:13,158
Scott: and the second one also has an avatar the last airbender table Which looks like an even better table, but I care even less about.

1177
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:25,303
Rym: Though to spite all of our friends from our IT who Insisted to this day that safecracker is the best pinball machine ever they had heard of safecracker and they said it was good But it was not the best.

1178
01:09:25,383 --> 01:09:30,260
Scott: Yeah, if you want to go check out the zine, it's drop target zine dot blogspot.com.

1179
01:09:31,241 --> 01:09:34,698
Scott: I'm gonna try to get all the issues of this and read them all because it's really pretty interesting.

1180
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:37,170
Emily: Speaking of hipsters in Brooklyn.

1181
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:38,515
Emily: This is another one.

1182
01:09:38,576 --> 01:09:39,460
Emily: I got her free.

1183
01:09:40,002 --> 01:09:50,656
Emily: She was actually handing out these 20-page comics and is called Wizards and it's about this hipster girl who gets sucked into this vortex to a fantasy land.

1184
01:09:50,737 --> 01:09:55,474
Emily: and she says on the cover I think I messed up But it's wizards tumblr.com.

1185
01:09:56,380 --> 01:10:02,760
Emily: So I'm assuming it's a webcomic and I'm gonna have to check it out because it ends right when she gets into the magical world.

1186
01:10:03,061 --> 01:10:07,820
Emily: And after all these shenanigans happen in the real world, and so I'm like, why did you leave me at a cliffhanger?

1187
01:10:08,409 --> 01:10:09,160
Rym: Give free taste.

1188
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,329
Scott: She's not getting away something for free.

1189
01:10:12,349 --> 01:10:13,736
Scott: that has closure true enough.

1190
01:10:13,817 --> 01:10:14,400
Rym: I picked up again.

1191
01:10:14,721 --> 01:10:15,464
Rym: I still have to read.

1192
01:10:15,505 --> 01:10:17,593
Rym: we have that play I bought at mocha last year.

1193
01:10:17,633 --> 01:10:18,276
Rym: I read it.

1194
01:10:18,517 --> 01:10:19,039
Emily: I read it.

1195
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:19,944
Emily: I want to read it.

1196
01:10:20,085 --> 01:10:22,600
Emily: It was depressing and full of drama.

1197
01:10:23,222 --> 01:10:24,848
Emily: Well, I picked up again cuz it's drum.

1198
01:10:24,989 --> 01:10:27,980
Rym: I saw it would look like some Civil War drama comics.

1199
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:34,500
Rym: I pick it up and it turns out that a brief rest in a shallow grave and other stories is short fiction.

1200
01:10:35,363 --> 01:10:37,280
Rym: As in just written fiction with a few illustrations.

1201
01:10:37,481 --> 01:10:39,192
Rym: I I just bought everything the guy had cuz.

1202
01:10:39,212 --> 01:10:40,440
Rym: it was super cheap and he seemed cool.

1203
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,330
Rym: I haven't read it yet, but I don't know.

1204
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:44,180
Rym: I'm really feeling short stories again.

1205
01:10:44,582 --> 01:10:51,756
Rym: That was something I was really into in like high school era of my life Like I just buy compendiums of short story short attention span theater.

1206
01:10:51,776 --> 01:11:00,540
Scott: Yeah Yeah, anyway, so I was trying to buy something else, you know, but I was sort of like whatever I was on my way out.

1207
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:11,862
Scott: There was this table that I had passed by a couple times and it was a collective of Boston people right and they basically what they did is they put all their mini comics together into two bundles the red bundle and the Blue bundle.

1208
01:11:12,183 --> 01:11:14,891
Scott: the blue bundle was kid-friendly the red bundle.

1209
01:11:14,911 --> 01:11:22,185
Scott: It's not porn but not exactly kid-friendly Right and it had a little.

1210
01:11:22,246 --> 01:11:22,708
Scott: that's how I knew.

1211
01:11:22,748 --> 01:11:27,990
Scott: it was a Bostonian thing because it comes in a little cloth bag With a silkscreen of either red or blue.

1212
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:29,356
Scott: Paul Revere on a horse on the front.

1213
01:11:29,396 --> 01:11:30,360
Emily: totally high quality.

1214
01:11:30,501 --> 01:11:31,085
Scott: So I got.

1215
01:11:31,105 --> 01:11:31,689
Scott: so I just picked.

1216
01:11:31,749 --> 01:11:33,320
Scott: I was like, yeah, I'll get the blue one.

1217
01:11:33,782 --> 01:11:35,008
Scott: So here's what was inside.

1218
01:11:35,088 --> 01:11:36,455
Scott: first of all bored angel was in there.

1219
01:11:36,475 --> 01:11:40,094
Scott: I was like, oh, I know bored angel I have bored angel have bored angel.

1220
01:11:40,114 --> 01:11:40,998
Scott: But anyway, I bored angels.

1221
01:11:41,019 --> 01:11:45,499
Scott: good There was one called Lumix which was actually probably the best one that was in there.

1222
01:11:45,921 --> 01:11:48,292
Scott: It's basically this big giant dude, right?

1223
01:11:48,493 --> 01:11:50,000
Scott: Who's an accidental superhero?

1224
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:53,913
Scott: He's actually really clumsy and he just all hits the bad all his clubs.

1225
01:11:53,993 --> 01:11:58,477
Scott: all his clumsiness hits the bad guys And it's like it's pretty great.

1226
01:12:00,022 --> 01:12:10,464
Scott: How to grow a giant monster was literally how to grow a giant monster by Eric Boa car webcomics nation comm slash e boa car Higher ground.

1227
01:12:10,484 --> 01:12:12,673
Scott: Well, it's actually higher ground.

1228
01:12:12,713 --> 01:12:14,479
Scott: is this thing about like dinosaurs?

1229
01:12:14,499 --> 01:12:17,288
Scott: and It's the guys like trying to open an egg.

1230
01:12:17,308 --> 01:12:22,354
Scott: so he's trying to get to higher ground so he can drop it and It wasn't particularly that exciting.

1231
01:12:22,395 --> 01:12:25,846
Scott: It's by Shelley Parallon, but the art is really good.

1232
01:12:25,906 --> 01:12:30,479
Scott: It's like it's like yellow and then lighter yellow and then it's pretty cute.

1233
01:12:30,881 --> 01:12:31,885
Emily: Yeah, yellow.

1234
01:12:32,388 --> 01:12:35,220
Scott: There was this thing called el oso which was entirely in Spanish.

1235
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,600
Scott: I don't really I could kind of follow it but kind of all right.

1236
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:44,220
Rym: So speaking of Spanish that the only trade kind of things I picked up there bit their issues, but it was put out by archaea.

1237
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:48,776
Rym: They're not terribly small feeding ground, which is it's six volumes.

1238
01:12:48,816 --> 01:12:49,920
Rym: Apparently I got the first four.

1239
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:57,632
Rym: It's printed doubly to where it's in Spanish and English Mm-hmm, but it's a where the front is English in the back is Spanish.

1240
01:12:57,853 --> 01:13:01,948
Rym: It's actually where coyotes and It's all it's really.

1241
01:13:01,968 --> 01:13:14,310
Rym: it's like this werewolf story but set in Mexican culture near the border with the border crossings and the Border Patrol in the US and the towns and It's just an interesting take on the old werewolf story.

1242
01:13:14,611 --> 01:13:16,519
Rym: and the werewolves are actually cool.

1243
01:13:17,081 --> 01:13:28,340
Scott: speaking of werewolves like bought a new Jason comic werewolves of Montpellier and it's kind of sad because it's like I bought all the Jason comics and their individual forms, but now they're selling hardcovers that collect a whole bunch each.

1244
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,760
Scott: So it's like you could just buy all these hardcovers.

1245
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,989
Rym: I almost bought all the hardcovers at the moment.

1246
01:13:32,029 --> 01:13:33,656
Scott: It's like I bought all the individuals.

1247
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:34,700
Scott: So now I was looking at him.

1248
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,468
Rym: I was like, ah, there's Jason in here.

1249
01:13:36,528 --> 01:13:39,040
Rym: I haven't read and it's Jason and hardcover.

1250
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:40,790
Scott: It's like I own all the Jason's anyway.

1251
01:13:40,871 --> 01:13:48,280
Scott: the last two things in the Boston book There was spider day night fever, which is just a whole bunch of Marvel characters drawn in hilarious dancing positions.

1252
01:13:48,888 --> 01:13:50,222
Scott: That's all that is I can never.

1253
01:13:50,242 --> 01:13:51,586
Scott: they were all spider-man characters.

1254
01:13:52,329 --> 01:13:55,540
Scott: and the last thing was actually Reggie and Brian and the lousy nickname.

1255
01:13:56,022 --> 01:14:01,020
Scott: And it's basically about this kid who lives in a fishing village and he's a fisherman with all the other fishermen, right?

1256
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,770
Scott: Only he's young and they're all old and his.

1257
01:14:03,971 --> 01:14:04,593
Scott: they call him.

1258
01:14:04,613 --> 01:14:14,319
Scott: they give him a nickname which is Krusty because his boat always has all the barnacles on it, right and He basically tries to get rid of the barnacles so he can get his nickname change to something else.

1259
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:18,552
Scott: So he goes and he really asked the mermaid and the mermaid.

1260
01:14:18,632 --> 01:14:20,439
Scott: Well, it's actually a mer dude wearing a sweater.

1261
01:14:21,921 --> 01:14:24,651
Scott: His mer dude friend is like, oh the barnacles.

1262
01:14:24,691 --> 01:14:26,357
Scott: They just like your boat because it's the most comfortable.

1263
01:14:26,377 --> 01:14:27,080
Scott: and he's like, ah shit.

1264
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,004
Scott: Well, how do I get him off?

1265
01:14:28,024 --> 01:14:35,945
Scott: He's like, oh you just got to say the magic words, you know in Murph in barnacle language, which is Lulu Lulu Lulu Lulu Right.

1266
01:14:36,025 --> 01:14:39,326
Scott: So if he goes to get his boat inspected So he's hoping it he's right.

1267
01:14:39,366 --> 01:14:42,820
Scott: he says Lulu Lulu to get all the barnacles off and his boat is super clean.

1268
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:45,428
Scott: So he's like, oh, I guess you can't call you Krusty anymore.

1269
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:48,077
Scott: Your new nickname is Lulu.

1270
01:14:48,177 --> 01:14:52,540
Scott: He's like, ah shit It's pretty funny even though I just gave it all away.

1271
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:55,228
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of a lot of these.

1272
01:14:55,389 --> 01:14:58,080
Scott: it's comics comics dot Metro kitty calm.

1273
01:14:58,462 --> 01:15:01,055
Scott: They tend to be like a short like six-page.

1274
01:15:01,075 --> 01:15:02,140
Scott: It's like one joke.

1275
01:15:02,381 --> 01:15:09,480
Scott: Yeah, this thing is like if a comic is just one joke and I don't tell you the joke Then you're not gonna understand why it's worthwhile.

1276
01:15:10,462 --> 01:15:14,120
Scott: But it's like if I tell you the joke, then you're not gonna need to read that comic.

1277
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:15,786
Scott: But the thing is all these people.

1278
01:15:15,826 --> 01:15:19,340
Scott: this is just like, you know, you can go to their websites and get more of their stuff.

1279
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:20,905
Scott: Yeah, they get all the jokes.

1280
01:15:20,946 --> 01:15:27,550
Emily: stuff is available on line for the for the most part, you know A lot of times they'll just put their webcomic URL on it.

1281
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:30,500
Emily: And so really what you're doing by buying these things?

1282
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:35,629
Emily: It's not even that like half of them You won't ever see again and you can't find it.

1283
01:15:35,689 --> 01:15:37,495
Emily: and it's just like people making zines.

1284
01:15:37,957 --> 01:15:38,659
Emily: and the other half.

1285
01:15:39,081 --> 01:15:41,294
Emily: It's like support webcomic artists.

1286
01:15:41,354 --> 01:15:45,585
Scott: Hooray so I have one last thing.

1287
01:15:45,705 --> 01:15:50,265
Emily: I One of the things I picked up.

1288
01:15:51,048 --> 01:15:54,660
Emily: I want a geek bite this sometime but it's a really cute.

1289
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,113
Rym: Oh, is that the learn kanji slash lesbians thing?

1290
01:15:57,213 --> 01:15:58,439
Emily: No, it's not learn kanji.

1291
01:15:59,147 --> 01:16:00,280
Rym: Assume that was a learning kanji.

1292
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:04,270
Emily: She means kind of like Rica.

1293
01:16:04,651 --> 01:16:07,800
Emily: That's like kind of because it says the cut the kanji.

1294
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:11,194
Rym: You thought it was a kanji book assumed that it taught you kanji.

1295
01:16:11,214 --> 01:16:12,299
Rym: I'd never looked inside of it.

1296
01:16:12,783 --> 01:16:14,440
Rym: No, I've seen it laying around.

1297
01:16:15,261 --> 01:16:22,327
Emily: it's this book I picked up back when the mocha was in the puck building and It's a Japanese indie comic.

1298
01:16:22,467 --> 01:16:32,535
Emily: but the author I think she either lives here part-time or Full-time now and cuz she really likes New York and she's been published in English by any lesbo.

1299
01:16:33,016 --> 01:16:35,259
Emily: come publishing.

1300
01:16:36,982 --> 01:16:39,049
Emily: But the cute thing is it's.

1301
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:42,160
Emily: it's a very very different than your usual manga.

1302
01:16:42,702 --> 01:16:43,685
Emily: It's you know, like dot.

1303
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:47,860
Emily: I is very very doodly kind of style and I dig data.

1304
01:16:48,121 --> 01:16:53,800
Emily: It was actually one of the first Like popular.

1305
01:16:54,482 --> 01:17:02,704
Emily: well for an indie comic Japanese comics that dealt with lesbian issues in a real way and wasn't all tragic or Wasn't all explicit.

1306
01:17:02,764 --> 01:17:14,587
Emily: It was just two college girls being like I like you and you know kind of getting on with their relationship and going to school and stuff and so The one I picked up this year.

1307
01:17:14,607 --> 01:17:20,319
Emily: I talked to Rika Takashima who was there and she signed it for me But it was the.

1308
01:17:22,143 --> 01:17:36,750
Emily: well, I picked it up partly because it's got what Vocaloid cosplay on the cover, but It's a little indie comic about one of the main characters from Rika Takashi Growing up Miho-chan and it's about her as a little kid.

1309
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:37,874
Emily: She's very tomboyish.

1310
01:17:37,894 --> 01:17:40,000
Emily: It's not even so much about being a lesbian.

1311
01:17:40,141 --> 01:17:43,640
Emily: It's more like about being a girl who likes to run around and get into trouble.

1312
01:17:43,823 --> 01:17:47,229
Scott: Very cute 20% cooler.

1313
01:17:47,269 --> 01:17:48,554
Emily: That's exactly the phrase.

1314
01:17:48,634 --> 01:17:50,360
Rym: I'll have to read Rika's kanji.

1315
01:17:50,540 --> 01:18:10,230
Emily: Yeah, the only sad thing is this this new collection that I bought, you know, it's it's unfinished it's it's pencil sketches because the earthquake Like was very upsetting and she spent a lot of time like Contacting her friends and doing volunteer stuff and everything.

1316
01:18:10,331 --> 01:18:13,360
Emily: So she didn't have time to finish before the mocha.

1317
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:14,324
Scott: She had time to print it.

1318
01:18:14,585 --> 01:18:19,686
Emily: Well, you know, it's like she took her sketches and put it together but it's like she.

1319
01:18:19,847 --> 01:18:32,399
Emily: she didn't concentrate full-time on the comic and I guess a lot of the Japanese people who I know, you know, if they're artists they tend to Be a little behind because of stuff that's been going on.

1320
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:38,737
Emily: So anyway, I'd recommend that and especially the original Rika Takashi.

1321
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:43,440
Rym: It's very cute Hmm and overall I'd say the mocha was as good as last year.

1322
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,489
Rym: In fact, I say better than last year for one reason.

1323
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:50,249
Rym: They only turned on half of the ceiling lights Yeah, and thank goodness.

1324
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:53,260
Emily: They had some airflow in there a little bit.

1325
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,247
Rym: I didn't realize how hot it was and it doesn't.

1326
01:18:55,328 --> 01:18:59,848
Scott: it doesn't really get hot until later in the afternoon when it gets crowded early In the day, it's actually pretty good.

1327
01:18:59,908 --> 01:19:09,808
Emily: you go into that one corner And it's like the corner with the door venting in and it's just like oh my god Over by the artists.

1328
01:19:09,848 --> 01:19:10,552
Emily: and so one more.

1329
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:20,900
Scott: one more thing that I got there right was the thing that was getting a lot of people's attention because the Production value of it is just so incredibly high as the anthology project and the anthology projects actually been around.

1330
01:19:21,302 --> 01:19:25,200
Scott: I guess it's sort of like the same thing as flight only smaller and hardcovers.

1331
01:19:26,062 --> 01:19:26,824
Scott: It's the same idea.

1332
01:19:26,905 --> 01:19:30,715
Scott: Anyway, where I get really high quality arts into an anthology book.

1333
01:19:30,756 --> 01:19:34,982
Scott: That's that with high production value typically all They.

1334
01:19:35,002 --> 01:19:38,514
Emily: they're not actually comic artists they work in other aspects of it doesn't really?

1335
01:19:38,936 --> 01:19:40,160
Scott: I only read the first volume.

1336
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:43,611
Scott: I didn't read the second one yet like it doesn't really say.

1337
01:19:43,631 --> 01:19:45,316
Scott: it's just like anthology project.

1338
01:19:45,356 --> 01:19:49,460
Scott: All right, here we go comics And they're all really really well drawn.

1339
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:49,661
Scott: Like.

1340
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:55,859
Scott: there's a whole wide range of art styles and the arts are all whether no matter what style it is They're all pretty amazing.

1341
01:19:56,321 --> 01:20:04,084
Scott: But I think I would totally believe that these are not comics people because a lot of the comics especially some of the wordless ones It's hard to follow.

1342
01:20:04,144 --> 01:20:04,305
Scott: like.

1343
01:20:04,585 --> 01:20:09,640
Scott: obviously the person has skills in drawing but not doing sequential flow in any way.

1344
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:14,559
Scott: So it's like you can't tell what's going on unless you go really slowly and really try to think pretty hard about it.

1345
01:20:15,662 --> 01:20:16,546
Scott: And you know a lot of the.

1346
01:20:16,948 --> 01:20:22,380
Scott: a lot of the writing on some of them was you know Uninteresting but the art on all of them was amazing.

1347
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:22,802
Scott: I don't know.

1348
01:20:22,842 --> 01:20:27,160
Scott: volume two is thicker and is newer and the cover is cooler looking.

1349
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,900
Scott: So maybe that'll be a different story.

1350
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,726
Scott: But I mean the art is just as amazing.

1351
01:20:31,328 --> 01:20:33,836
Scott: and they had a special deal by both for 50 bucks.

1352
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:34,318
Scott: That's 25 each.

1353
01:20:35,482 --> 01:20:36,888
Scott: It's a pretty good deal for such like.

1354
01:20:36,949 --> 01:20:39,500
Scott: it's like you should see them if you look at these things.

1355
01:20:39,981 --> 01:20:44,337
Scott: They're like a mate, you know, it's like the highest quality most expensive printing you can get.

1356
01:20:44,357 --> 01:20:46,905
Scott: so, you know You buy this the sort of the same reason.

1357
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:49,814
Scott: you would buy something like robot or Apple, right?

1358
01:20:49,834 --> 01:20:55,531
Scott: It's like, you know, beautiful expensive high color printing of awesome arts.

1359
01:20:55,571 --> 01:20:57,920
Scott: that happens to be comics, you know.

1360
01:20:58,684 --> 01:21:09,578
Scott: and then maybe some of them are actually good comics, they're all really short and It's a lot of eye candy basically, so I guess last and not least we can't at least talk about that The Johnny Wonder crew finally had a table.

1361
01:21:10,923 --> 01:21:13,578
Scott: Yeah, they never had a table there even though they've gone there every year.

Rym: every year We're like, how come you guys don't get a table?

1363
01:21:15,436 --> 01:21:20,150

01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:20,691
Scott: It's not like.

1365
01:21:20,952 --> 01:21:24,900

1366
01:21:28,461 --> 01:21:32,317
Scott: Reason the tables are so expensive because that's the fundraiser that keeps the mocha around.
