00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,575
Rym: It's Thursday, July 28th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:15,370
Rym: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,015
Rym: Horror!

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,048
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,550
Scott: So, when you're biking around, one of the necessary accessories is the bottle of water.

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,700
Rym: Bottle of water?

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,250
Rym: Or the CamelBak.

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,390
Scott: Well, the CamelBak is for a long bike.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,490
Rym: No, what you need to do, and I'm ordering a second one, you need one, like, big CamelBak for when you're going on, like, some long journey.

10
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:48,190
Rym: But they also make really little ones that only hold, like, a liter, but they're basically just, like, the best form factor for biking.

11
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:50,646
Scott: Why would you get only, uh, whatever.

12
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:55,003
Scott: If I'm only going to work, I only need a bottle of water.

13
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:56,610
Scott: I don't need a CamelBak.

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,910
Rym: You can't just hold out that, like, 20 minutes to get to work?

15
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:02,110
Scott: It's good to have water.

16
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:10,770
Scott: Anyway, so, I had this basically really cheapo water bottle from the bike shop that was the cheapest possible water bottle you could get.

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,450
Rym: Do you have, uh, PHBs and all that?

18
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,870
Scott: I don't know, but, you know, it was fine.

19
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,616
Scott: But it was not very well insulated.

20
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:22,350
Scott: You know, the water, if I put an ice cube in it and I walked outside, the ice cube would no longer be an ice cube.

21
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:23,750
Scott: And I was like, ah, that's disappointing.

22
00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:26,148
Scott: So, I went on Amazon, like I do.

23
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,490
Scott: Found, and I was looking at the highest rated water bottles that fit in bicycles.

24
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:33,864
Scott: So, I saw the CamelBak Podium Big Chill 25 ounce, right?

25
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:36,097
Scott: And that's the one I got.

26
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,850
Scott: There were some other ones that looked really good, though.

27
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,600
Scott: There's this bottle called the Clean Bottle.

28
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:40,405
Scott: Get this, you ready?

29
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:41,250
Scott: Genius.

30
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:44,069
Scott: You can open it from the bottom also to clean it.

31
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,119
Scott: Genius.

32
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:48,319
Scott: There was also this very popular one.

33
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:51,510
Scott: It was like the Polar something that was incredibly well insulated.

34
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:57,009
Scott: But I got this CamelBak one because, while it didn't, it was five star rated, just like the Polar one.

35
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:05,850
Scott: But, even though it had less total ratings, but it had some amount of insulation, but not amazing insulation, but some.

36
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:09,350
Scott: And it had, it didn't open on the bottom, obviously.

37
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:16,410
Scott: But, the nozzle on the top, right, it wasn't the usual CamelBak one with the biting, like I have at work at my desk.

38
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:21,550
Scott: It was a kind where water can't get out unless you squeeze it.

39
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,303
Scott: And you can actually twist it to lock it completely.

40
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:25,730
Scott: So, there's no way water can get out.

41
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:31,430
Scott: And actually, that was a problem I had, where like, with the crappy water bottles, you'd hit bumps in the street and water would go psh, psh.

42
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:31,900
Rym: Really?

43
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:32,383
Rym: Yeah.

44
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,930
Rym: I've never had that happen, even with crappy bottles.

45
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,283
Scott: It's a really crappy bottle.

46
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:36,990
Scott: It's basically open.

47
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,510
Scott: So, this one really closes and water will not come out unless like you suck on it or squeeze it or something.

48
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,790
Rym: It's got like the 50 cent water bottles in any bike store don't leak.

49
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,607
Scott: This was the 50 cent bottle and it leaks.

50
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,630
Rym: Doesn't it have like the bit that you just bite and like pull open?

51
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,169
Scott: No, it's not a, yeah, you pull it.

52
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,685
Scott: And the thing is, when you push it back in to close it, it doesn't 100% close.

53
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,249
Rym: You know, for 50 cents, you could have gotten another one that worked.

54
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:01,316
Scott: I'm just saying.

55
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:03,050
Scott: It was mostly for the insulation that I ordered.

56
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,210
Rym: And you could have wrapped it in some rags.

57
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,470
Scott: Yeah, so I ordered this mostly for the insulation, but you know, the nozzle that was fancy was an added bonus.

58
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,330
Rym: Does this fascinating story go anywhere?

59
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,410
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't be setting it up for no reason.

60
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,190
Rym: There's a lot of setups, so there'd better be a lot of payoff.

61
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,470
Scott: So, I went to the post office this morning and there it was, because you know, they gave me the orange slip, the pink slip, whatever.

62
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:23,416
Scott: I got it.

63
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:24,530
Scott: I filled it up with water.

64
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:30,550
Rym: Here's an aside, I had a crazy dream where I moved to an apartment that didn't have a doorman and all my packages disappeared.

65
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:31,166
Rym: Okay.

66
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:32,910
Rym: Like every package that came disappeared.

67
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,680
Scott: So I got it at the post office.

68
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:35,670
Scott: I filled it up with water.

69
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,770
Scott: The water didn't taste like plastic or anything.

70
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,965
Scott: Even though I didn't even clean the bottle at all.

71
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:40,630
Scott: It was great.

72
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,510
Scott: And then I put ice cubes in it and walked outside and they were still ice cubes.

73
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,769
Scott: I could hear them banging around in there.

74
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:50,050
Scott: And that little nozzly thing on the top totally worked, not bullshit.

75
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:51,769
Scott: It's actually really, really cool.

76
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,310
Rym: Did you lose the water bottle?

77
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,409
Scott: The water bottle was too big.

78
00:03:57,392 --> 00:03:58,208
Scott: By a little bit.

79
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,509
Scott: It was too big.

80
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:02,470
Rym: That's the saddest story.

81
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:09,090
Scott: It was a little too big for, you know, it's basically, it was, it was like one and a half times as long as a usual bike water bottle.

82
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,250
Scott: So I stuck it in there and I was sort of careful on the way to work and it got to work just fine.

83
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:19,470
Scott: But then on the way home from work, it, uh, I was biking.

84
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,510
Rym: Did it fall off and roll like off the Queensborough bridge or something?

85
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:30,330
Scott: I was just, you know, I, I put it, I filled it up at work, put it in the little holder, waited for the elevator, got in the elevator.

86
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:34,310
Scott: Started biking to work, a bike at home, not even home, bike in here.

87
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,749
Scott: I was biking here.

88
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:39,550
Scott: And then on second Avenue, I looked down and is not there.

89
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,929
Rym: Somebody might've stolen it.

90
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:51,830
Scott: And I, I remembered at one point hearing, like I had a memory of hearing a noise of clunk sploosh, but I don't, I don't know when it could have been in the elevator.

91
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,329
Scott: It could have been at work.

92
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:54,348
Scott: It might still be at work.

93
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:58,510
Scott: It could have been on 49th street under a car's wheel.

94
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,489
Scott: It could have been anywhere.

95
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,449
Scott: So it was only 12 bucks.

96
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,110
Rym: Oh, to be fair, if it was clunk sploosh, it clearly was not that airtight.

97
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,770
Scott: It could have been clunk sploosh in the elevator.

98
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,110
Rym: But no, the sploosh is the part I'm pointing out.

99
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,110
Scott: But this is just the memory.

100
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,390
Scott: The memory could be totally wrong.

101
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:15,390
Rym: Are you sure you even bought the water bottle?

102
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:15,910
Scott: Absolutely.

103
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:16,889
Scott: You sure you didn't dream it?

104
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,109
Scott: Here's an Amazon page.

105
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,409
Scott: It says right here, you can see it.

106
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,969
Scott: Instant order update for Scott Rubin.

107
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,885
Scott: You purchased this item on July 20th.

108
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:23,449
Scott: View this order.

109
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:27,130
Scott: So I'm not going to buy that one again because it's too big.

110
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:29,630
Scott: It's even it won't fit at any bike.

111
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,409
Scott: It's too long.

112
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:33,790
Scott: I might just go buy another cheapo one.

113
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:43,927
Scott: But if you need a water bottle and you don't care that it's long or maybe, you know, some, I have the kind of buy a water bottle holder that goes on like the frame in the front.

114
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:48,990
Scott: Some people have the kind you ever see the dual wheeled under the seat bike bottle holders.

115
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:49,345
Rym: Yeah.

116
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:49,890
Scott: Yeah.

117
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:56,750
Scott: If you have one of those, you know, that's basically more like a cup holder for a car, then two of these will probably be pretty awesome.

118
00:05:56,871 --> 00:06:05,427
Rym: My mountain bike, I used to always carry, I had a water bottle thing like on the like upward on the, in the inside of the frame and then another one hanging off the top of the frame for two.

119
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:10,107
Scott: Yeah, you can do two that way, but this is the ones I've seen in like the behind the seat dual wheeled.

120
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:12,850
Scott: That would definitely be able to hold this motherfucker.

121
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:17,768
Scott: But the other thing is though the installation was not the greatest, right?

122
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,645
Scott: There's other bottles out there that have insulation.

123
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:22,234
Scott: that is like ridiculous to be amazing.

124
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:24,144
Scott: Like I've seen insulated bottles so good.

125
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,150
Scott: They're like igloos.

126
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:32,190
Scott: You could put ice in there, leave it in a hot car, come get it out of the hot car after work and they'll still be ice in there.

127
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,070
Rym: So how thick is that insulation?

128
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,490
Rym: How much water usually fit in there with it simultaneously not being too fat to stick in your bike.

129
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:47,608
Scott: Usually those ones are the kind where it's like metal and then air and then insulation and then air and then metal and they're kind of fat.

130
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:53,950
Rym: I honestly don't see the point though because warm water is more pleasant to drink exercising.

131
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,050
Scott: Warm water tastes like you've never exercised.

132
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,388
Scott: Warm water is nasty.

133
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,670
Scott: Who wants to drink warm water?

134
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,800
Rym: So independently I felt kind of stupid.

135
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,590
Rym: I saw some Japanese video the other day.

136
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,965
Rym: It was like how to cool down a hot car.

137
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:09,529
Scott: That was a good video.

138
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,690
Scott: As fast as possible.

139
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,328
Scott: I like that video.

140
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:12,930
Rym: And I thought, all right, what are they going to do?

141
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,568
Rym: Like pour water over it and then he rolls down the passenger side window and I'm like, oh, all right, duh.

142
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:30,089
Rym: And then he opens the driver's side door and slams it shut without opening the window and does it like five times and they demonstrably reduce the temperature by a surprising degree.

143
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:34,567
Scott: Yeah, because you basically just suck all the hot air out and suck all the cold air from outside the car in.

144
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:35,270
Rym: Yeah.

145
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:36,410
Scott: He is the problem though.

146
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,410
Rym: I'm glad that I learned this now in a day when I no longer own a car.

147
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,450
Scott: Well, the thing is that strategy is sort of false, right?

148
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:49,070
Scott: Because yes, it will decrease the air temperature of inside the car and then you can start the air conditioner afterwards and you'll be better off.

149
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,950
Scott: But I really don't have a problem with hot air in the car.

150
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:52,808
Scott: That doesn't bother me.

151
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:54,769
Scott: Even though it will save you on the air conditioner.

152
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,850
Rym: You're going to complain about the hot seats.

153
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,009
Scott: Hot seats and more importantly, hot buckles that burn your hand when you try to put your seat belt on.

154
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,529
Scott: Hot steering wheels also a problem.

155
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,627
Rym: You get one of those reflective things and put it in the car.

156
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:09,730
Scott: That's preventing the car from getting hot.

157
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:10,670
Scott: Cooling it down.

158
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,704
Scott: That's two different strategies.

159
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,910
Rym: Yeah, but you've already failed if you have to cool it down.

160
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,548
Scott: I'm just saying.

161
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:23,069
Scott: But yeah, you should do the cool down thing anyway even if you look stupid because the air conditioning will do less work and you'll save gas and such and such.

162
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,260
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:31,330
Rym: So I want to talk about this briefly because it's making the rounds and it does kind of involve My Little Pony.

164
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,990
Scott: Great ponies.

165
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:48,010
Rym: A lot of people have been talking and even some semi-legitimate old world journalists about how Hasbro's handling of the My Little Pony franchise is possibly the most powerful argument for expanded fair use laws we have ever seen.

166
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:56,930
Rym: Because the creative explosion that has come out, like other properties are just as mash-up-able, but because the people...

167
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,409
Scott: Well, it is slightly more conducive to mash-up-ery.

168
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:00,704
Rym: It is, but at the same time...

169
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,610
Scott: Anything live action is slightly less conducive just by its very nature.

170
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:03,812
Scott: But, for

171
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:20,230
Rym: example, shows a lot of things that are on Hulu, especially like Archer, some of these animated shows, are pretty mash-up-able in a similar way, but yet the properties are so locked down and people get shut down for even like sharing anything about them so much that nothing really happens.

172
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,549
Scott: This is why there's articles about ponies on every single site in the universe, even Slashdot, right?

173
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,550
Scott: But meanwhile, Archer, where are there articles about Archer?

174
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,330
Scott: Maybe on Cartoon Brew, that's about it.

175
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,310
Rym: Now, some people have argued that maybe it's just because it's ponies.

176
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:34,766
Scott: No.

177
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:36,770
Rym: I don't know, the fact that we're watching ponies.

178
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,029
Scott: Yeah, think about this.

179
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:41,169
Scott: If a good show... No, not that ponies are a good show.

180
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,669
Scott: But I'm saying, let's say, for example...

181
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,769
Rym: They're on a different continuum.

182
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:54,690
Scott: Yeah, let's say, for example, that The Simpsons, right, wasn't so jerky about taking all their clips off the internets, right?

183
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:57,249
Scott: Well, everyone would just be mashing up Simpsons.

184
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,050
Scott: We wouldn't have to resort to mashing up ponies.

185
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,110
Rym: Do you know how often I would post Peter going,

186
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,998
Rym: "Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh?"

187
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:06,110
Rym: If I could just do that and get away with it without the videos disappearing on me?

188
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:06,643
Scott: I know, right?

189
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:10,350
Scott: Instead, we used Trollface.

190
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:13,550
Rym: But it is interesting that My Little Pony was the one.

191
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:15,570
Rym: And Hasbro, in the beginning, had no idea.

192
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,080
Rym: They were just like... Oops.

193
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,486
Rym: As soon as they saw YouTube, they're like,

194
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:19,748
Rym: "What?".

195
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:22,070
Rym: And there were takedown notices everywhere.

196
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:24,709
Rym: And then, that stopped.

197
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:28,929
Rym: And the real kicker was when Hasbro started making their own stuff.

198
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:33,790
Rym: that is surprisingly similar to the kinds of things the fans were making.

199
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,370
Scott: I mean, I'm not gonna buy any of their shitty toys.

200
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,749
Rym: Not yet, because the toys are shitty.

201
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,430
Scott: But, I will buy a shitty toy under one circumstance.

202
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:44,389
Rym: It's Rainbow Dash.

203
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,470
Scott: No, there's already a shitty Rainbow Dash.

204
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,129
Scott: I'm not gonna buy that.

205
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,450
Scott: Because two people gave me free shitty Rainbow Dashes.

206
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:57,770
Scott: I will buy a shitty Derpy Hooves, no matter how shitty, just to show them, right, that fair use is a good idea.

207
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,168
Rym: But in general, this is...

208
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,650
Scott: Because what Derpy Hooves symbolizes is worth the money.

209
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:06,190
Rym: Who argue with people who don't get it, or who argue against fair use.

210
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,410
Rym: The ponies are probably a really strong argument you can use against these people.

211
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,550
Rym: Just go on YouTube and find one of those great videos someone's made.

212
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,690
Scott: All this stuff about intellectual property here is old news.

213
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,730
Scott: We've said it a billion times.

214
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,889
Scott: We've been saying it for over a decade.

215
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:28,010
Rym: Yeah, the only difference is that we have something here right now that is such a great example of why we need better laws.

216
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,390
Scott: There's a better... No, here's a better argument to make, right?

217
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,609
Scott: Here's a better argument to make using this evidence.

218
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,090
Scott: So ponies, fair use, right?

219
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,170
Scott: Because they have gone the fair use route, they're getting way more popular, right?

220
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,370
Scott: They're making all this extra money off this thing that they otherwise wouldn't, right?

221
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,310
Scott: The fair use is beneficial in the market.

222
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,530
Rym: Ah, but here's the trouble.

223
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,250
Rym: Fair use is so ephemeral and so poorly defined.

224
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:53,809
Scott: Hold on, right?

225
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,003
Scott: But meanwhile, regardless of the law, wouldn't that mean...

226
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,376
Rym: Right, I'm saying...

227
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:11,969
Scott: No, what I'm saying is look, one company has decided to let people go nuts and it's giving them more money.

228
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,944
Scott: Other companies that don't decide to do this are making less money.

229
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:26,350
Scott: So shouldn't the market correct and despite whatever the law is, wouldn't therefore that money encourage more companies to go the Hasbro route?

230
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,549
Rym: I can tell you why not.

231
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:33,250
Scott: More companies have not gone the Hasbro route, which is evidence that the market doesn't really work that way, does it?

232
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,690
Scott: So when people say the invisible hand, well, invisible hand is taking a nap.

233
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:37,509
Rym: I disagree.

234
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,390
Rym: I think it's a little more subtle than that.

235
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,670
Scott: Invisible hand is taking a nap.

236
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,970
Rym: I think what's happening here is that it's a prisoner's dilemma on a mass scale of all the media producers.

237
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,950
Rym: Because what have we always complained about and what a lot of nerds complain about?

238
00:12:50,350 --> 00:13:01,249
Rym: The long tail and all that doesn't really factor into markets because catering to the kind of real market as it exists destroys the market for the things that actually make these companies money now.

239
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,350
Scott: You've got to do both at the same time.

240
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:04,430
Scott: It's not that hard.

241
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,350
Rym: No, it is because what is popular?

242
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:21,238
Rym: Things that tend to be pushed onto people and tend to be marketed in a certain way and then the restrictions on use and then the selling of products, they make more money from that than they would make with the fair use in the long run if everything was fair use.

243
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:31,590
Rym: because that kind of -- it's kind of like Nintendo where if you drive the price down where people are more willing to pay a dollar for Angry Birds than $40 for two Angry Birds on the DS.

244
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:32,930
Scott: You don't understand.

245
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:43,910
Scott: There is an easy way to do it where you can hit the nerds and get all their monies and you can also hit the normal people and get the normal people monies at the same time.

246
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,830
Rym: Let all non-commercial use just flourish on the internet.

247
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:47,393
Scott: Right.

248
00:13:47,413 --> 00:14:04,510
Scott: For example, Apple could enable -- just add one check box deep in the settings that says enable sideload and every nerd would use an iPhone because they could get all the user interface and load whatever apps they want without jailbreaking and no normal person would ever do that or figure out how to do it.

249
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,950
Scott: and they would continue to dump all their money into the app store and Apple would get both markets.

250
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,690
Scott: They would have the nerds and the normal people.

251
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:12,850
Rym: And look at what Hasbro is doing.

252
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,010
Rym: They're making nods toward this fan base.

253
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:18,390
Rym: They're letting all this awesome fair use just kind of happen.

254
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:28,070
Scott: They let We Love Fine license pony t-shirts and they're making pony t-shirts for bronies and they also make pony coloring books in Target at the same time.

255
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:29,654
Scott: And you know what?

256
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:34,050
Scott: Some of the nerds still buy the normal shit even though they know it's shitty.

257
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,209
Scott: It's this weird thing that nerds do.

258
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:40,886
Scott: They'll go for the nerdy thing that only nerds want, like a $500 statue.

259
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,338
Rym: But not even a statue.

260
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,589
Rym: It's usually just a bust.

261
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:46,710
Scott: Here is a perfect example.

262
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:48,230
Scott: So you have Spider-Man.

263
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,689
Scott: Spider-Man appeals to the masses and also to the nerds.

264
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,230
Scott: The comic books, only nerds will buy those.

265
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,069
Scott: Spider-Man movie, normal people see it.

266
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,590
Scott: Nerd also goes to see Spider-Man movie.

267
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:02,010
Scott: Even if it's a shitty one, Spider-Man fan can't help but go to it.

268
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,870
Rym: What's interesting is that Spider-Man fan does not go to turn off the dark.

269
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,698
Scott: No, maybe he does.

270
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,170
Scott: There's actually a lot of people go to see it.

271
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:12,485
Rym: I think only tourists go to see it.

272
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:15,020
Scott: A lot of people go to see it.

273
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,369
Scott: I don't know why they do, but they do.

274
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:18,489
Rym: Everybody else knows better, but the tourists don't know.

275
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:25,130
Scott: The point is you can hit both markets, but if you push out the nerd market... This is where I want to get back to my point.

276
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:29,110
Rym: If I hit both markets, that's fine.

277
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:40,469
Rym: If everybody hits both markets, fast forward a generation or two, and the free, fair use nerd market becomes mainstream because everybody else starts to catch up.

278
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,615
Scott: No, I see.

279
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:44,330
Scott: It won't cause that to happen.

280
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:45,830
Scott: That is an inevitability.

281
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,250
Rym: I don't think it is, because people are too easily manipulated.

282
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:59,590
Scott: I think it's an inevitability, and if you don't go for both markets now, then you stay in the mainstream market, then when that happens, when the free use nerd market is the only market, you'll have nothing.

283
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,810
Scott: You have to hit both now, that way you'll be prepared for the nerd-only future.

284
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:13,510
Rym: I think the media companies actually believe that they can keep the free culture as a sideline and hide it from the masses forever.

285
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:14,075
Scott: Can't do it.

286
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:15,709
Scott: It's going to break out.

287
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,270
Rym: Let me look at YouTube already.

288
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,539
Scott: It's already breaking out.

289
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:19,447
Scott: The other thing...

290
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:26,630
Rym: Look in the '80s, '90s, shows like Getting Hit in the Nuts, Home Video, anything like that, Bob Saget.

291
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,430
Rym: Shows like that were very popular.

292
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:38,930
Rym: And now, even your mom is going to watch videos of people getting hit in the nuts on YouTube rather than watch a TV show where there's ads and then occasional nut shots.

293
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,689
Scott: Only grandma will watch nut shots on TV.

294
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,250
Rym: But even grandmas will find out about YouTube.

295
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:46,629
Scott: There are some grandmas who can watch nut shots on YouTube, but most of them watch nut shots on TV.

296
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,590
Rym: They used to say that porn was the driver of technology.

297
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,730
Rym: I don't think that's true anymore.

298
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,990
Scott: It's always funny when we're in a hotel and the news is showing YouTube videos.

299
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,550
Rym: That happens a lot.

300
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:57,790
Rym: Even CNBC, it's kind of amazing.

301
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,146
Scott: Or they'll read tweets out loud on the TV.

302
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,099
Rym: I put forth a new supposition.

303
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:04,770
Rym: Forget porn driving the industry, I don't think that exists anymore.

304
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:09,410
Rym: I will argue that nut shots follow the real industry now.

305
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:20,989
Rym: If you just follow where people get videos of cute animals and people getting hit in the nuts, wherever that is going, that is like the bulge ahead of the curve of the next trend of where people consume media.

306
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:30,229
Scott: The other thing is that even if, you know, there's always, you know, the dual market will still last for quite a while before the nerd market takes over the whole show.

307
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,913
Rym: I mean, look, music.

308
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:36,970
Rym: The music industry is still holding on to the bitter end and still hasn't disappeared.

309
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:43,530
Scott: Allowing the nerd market to go instead of fighting it is basically, you're basically saying no to free marketing, right?

310
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:53,890
Scott: How much has the non nerd pony market audience expanded because of the marketing influence and the, you know, the promoting of the nerds?

311
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:56,901
Scott: And it's not even just directly due to like.

312
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,050
Scott: I saw a funny pony video on YouTube.

313
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,790
Scott: Therefore, I became a pony fan.

314
00:18:01,553 --> 00:18:03,790
Scott: There was nerds made funny pony videos.

315
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:07,610
Scott: So magazines wrote articles about ponies that normal people read.

316
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,450
Rym: Magazines?

317
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,613
Scott: Yeah, right.

318
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,858
Scott: But that's what normal people do.

319
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,250
Scott: is they read magazines, you know.

320
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:21,450
Scott: So it's like because the nerds are fair using the ponies, the ponies get into the mainstream media more than they otherwise would have.

321
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:28,470
Scott: Thus increasing, you know, the other audience that, you know, you know, this allows other kind of market.

322
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,490
Rym: Look at what Apple does with their apps.

323
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:34,330
Rym: They'll let people make apps or submit apps that they won't accept.

324
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:41,050
Rym: But if an app gets popular that adds some sort of core functionality, they'll basically just steal it and do it themselves.

325
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:47,749
Rym: And companies that do this stuff with the nerd market and let the nerd fair use market thrive can do the same thing.

326
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,810
Rym: Whoa, Derpy Hooves is popular.

327
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,509
Rym: Going to sell me a Derpy Hooves t-shirt.

328
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:55,910
Rym: Someone made a funny comic that's really popular.

329
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:59,310
Rym: I'm going to hire people to make a similar comic and sell it overseas.

330
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:00,701
Scott: Alrighty.

331
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:10,970
Rym: So, yeah, it's interesting that this is that pony, of all the things it could have been that are pushing the fair use argument into mainstream media, it just happened to be the ponies.

332
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:11,545
Scott: Yep.

333
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:14,250
Scott: I didn't do any news at all.

334
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:14,807
Rym: You can go.

335
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:15,444
Scott: Oh, okay.

336
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:16,369
Rym: I didn't stop anything.

337
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,235
Scott: I heard you clicking.

338
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:19,110
Scott: It sounded like you were making a move.

339
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,689
Scott: So I want to be talking about, you know, this should be saved for Tuesday news, but it's too big.

340
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,248
Scott: I want to talk about Nintendo fans.

341
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:27,399
Rym: Oh, my God.

342
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:28,029
Rym: Interesting.

343
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:32,809
Rym: This is the first Nintendo portable that neither of us bought the day it came out.

344
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,410
Scott: Yeah, well, since the Game Boy Color.

345
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:40,670
Scott: I bought Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, DS, pretty much those three on the day they came out.

346
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,870
Scott: All the SPs, DS lights, they don't count.

347
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,110
Rym: I didn't get a Game Boy at first, but not because I didn't want one, because my mom wouldn't buy me one that soon.

348
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,390
Scott: My brother got a Game Boy Pocket.

349
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,430
Rym: I got a Game Gear before I got a Game Boy.

350
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,750
Scott: Anyway, I never had the Game Boy Game Boy.

351
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:58,869
Scott: Wow, I had the Game Boy-- My brother had the Game Boy Pocket and I had the Game Boy Color, but our friends had a Game Boy Game Boy that I played a lot.

352
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,510
Rym: Wow, my brother had the Game Boy Game Boy and I had the Game Gear, and we'd trade back and forth.

353
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,863
Scott: Anyway, so if you don't know the news, basically the 3DS, not to look so good.

354
00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:14,410
Scott: So they're dropping the price down to 180, which is from 250.

355
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,650
Rym: That's way early for Nintendo to do something like that.

356
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:24,269
Rym: Nintendo never drops the price that early on anything, which means-- But yet they're dropping the price, but the first party good games people are waiting for aren't even out yet.

357
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:29,510
Scott: Yeah, it's like they should have kept the price up and put the games out, then maybe some people would have bought it, right?

358
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,470
Scott: Games are the reason people aren't buying it.

359
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,130
Rym: But the thing is, the games, I don't even trust Nintendo to make the games I want anymore.

360
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,140
Scott: No kidding.

361
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,030
Scott: And they're not on the horizon.

362
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,630
Rym: To this day, what are the games I would play?

363
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,750
Scott: That's why I'm still not going to buy it for 180, because still the only reason I'm not buying it is because there's no advance orders.

364
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,590
Rym: Right now, Scott, there's four people in this apartment.

365
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:55,690
Rym: If I was going to play a Nintendo game in rough order, I would play Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Advance Wars, Four Swords.

366
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,370
Rym: Yeah, Four Swords, maybe Mario Tenies, Mario Soccer.

367
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:05,830
Scott: I think they announced Mario Kart 7, which is weird, because there's more than seven Mario Karts already existing.

368
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:08,069
Rym: Brawl, I would play right now, maybe.

369
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,713
Scott: That's not bad.

370
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,847
Scott: Anyway, so the point is, they're lowering the price because 3DS, not to look so good.

371
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:13,150
Scott: Okay.

372
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,989
Scott: This isn't going to help.

373
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,330
Scott: What if you paid $250?

374
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,182
Scott: Now it's like, "What the fuck,

375
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:17,688
Scott: Nintendo?".

376
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:24,030
Scott: They're giving you a consolation prize, which is actually, admittedly, a lot of virtual console games.

377
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,724
Scott: They're giving you a pile of virtual console games, both GBA and NES, real ones.

378
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:43,109
Rym: See, good on them, because Nintendo, for all its Japanese sensibility as a company, that is a very Japanese thing to do, to be like, basically apologize to the people who didn't get, basically who got screwed by you realizing that you fucked up.

379
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,885
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is I wonder, right?

380
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:48,023
Rym: Sony would never do anything like that.

381
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:48,810
Rym: They just dropped the price.

382
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,190
Scott: Yeah, Sony, they gave everyone one lousy game for the PSN out of it.

383
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,569
Rym: Microsoft, or just flip you off?

384
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:54,352
Scott: Yeah.

385
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:56,308
Scott: I don't know.

386
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:56,590
Scott: Maybe.

387
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,110
Scott: Microsoft is kind of iffy what they would do.

388
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:01,388
Rym: No, they would-- They're moody.

389
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,310
Rym: They wouldn't drop the price because the price would have been already artificially low.

390
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,874
Scott: That's right.

391
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:06,923
Scott: That's what I was going to say.

392
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,030
Scott: They dropped the price from $250 to $170, $180.

393
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,823
Scott: Does that mean that they were making a $70 profit and a $170 is still profitable?

394
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,749
Rym: Or are they going at a loss now?

395
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:17,959
Scott: Or are they going at a loss now?

396
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:19,410
Scott: Because they were definitely at a profit before.

397
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:27,530
Rym: Now, if I were them, way from the beginning, I would have gone with the Razer model and I would have given up on the philosophy of making money on every console.

398
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:34,030
Rym: I would have sold the 3DS cheap and I would have really pushed the downloadable content for money, microtransactions.

399
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,850
Scott: Right, but the problem is their downloadable content is too much money.

400
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,816
Rym: Oh, I would have made it cheap.

401
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,990
Rym: I would have made it like a dollar for an NES game.

402
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:41,370
Scott: Right, so here's the other problem.

403
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,670
Scott: They're giving you a fistful of virtual console games.

404
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:44,354
Scott: But you know what?

405
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:50,270
Scott: I have a piracy card in my regular DS that is every NES, every SNES, a ton of GBA, and a ton of DS games.

406
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,830
Rym: Never mind the fact that anyone with a PSP.

407
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,139
Scott: And every Game Boy game ever.

408
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,590
Scott: And every Game Boy Color game ever.

409
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,689
Scott: PSP people can do the same piracy.

410
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,729
Scott: Right, so here's what I would have done if I was Nintendo.

411
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,409
Scott: Right, which they would never do in a million years.

412
00:23:02,773 --> 00:23:04,166
Scott: But this is the right strategy.

413
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:04,530
Scott: Ready?

414
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,710
Scott: You would sell the 3DS for the $250.

415
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,049
Scott: Keep the price high.

416
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:13,370
Scott: Put some flash memory in it, right?

417
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,008
Scott: Because if you can afford to drop $70 off the price, you can afford to put 32 gigs of flash in the 3DS.

418
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,570
Rym: Yeah, 32 gigs of flash is effectively free.

419
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:36,348
Scott: Right, so you put 32 gigs of flash in the 3DS built in, and on that 32 gigs of flash extra, you put every virtual console game, every game that you have the legal right to put on there, you put on there for free.

420
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:38,089
Rym: Not that that's a good idea.

421
00:23:38,631 --> 00:23:39,010
Scott: SNES.

422
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,190
Rym: You gotta be a little more evil here if you want to really make money.

423
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:43,978
Scott: No, no, no.

424
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:44,849
Scott: I'm not done yet.

425
00:23:45,451 --> 00:23:47,640
Scott: So, people paying $250, which is $70 profit, right?

426
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,021
Scott: Big time.

427
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,266
Scott: Everyone's like, "Oh shit, people are lining up to buy that

428
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:53,770
Scott: motherfucker.".

429
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,010
Rym: I would have bought one like immediately if that were the thing.

430
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:11,570
Scott: And then, right, what you do is you still charge in the DSiWare, the downloadable area, you know, the DSware, you know, sort of the WiiWare equivalent indie games, and you gotta allow the indie games in, obviously.

431
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,870
Scott: We've talked about that in the past.

432
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,189
Rym: They have Nintendo already then.

433
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:19,530
Scott: Yeah, regular DS games, GBA games, GameCube games can run on that, right?

434
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:29,090
Scott: You know, you put all those games in there, not free, but the NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color games, all just all free, period, all of them.

435
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,126
Scott: You get everything, right, in those 32 gigs.

436
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:32,690
Scott: It's already installed.

437
00:24:32,953 --> 00:24:34,450
Scott: As soon as you buy the thing, you need to do everything.

438
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,970
Rym: I would have been a little more subtle to make a little more money.

439
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,230
Rym: What I would have done is made NES games free.

440
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,110
Rym: The entire catalog for everyone forever free.

441
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,770
Scott: Or, you know, if you want to make a little bit of money, here's what you can do, right?

442
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:50,283
Scott: You can say, "Yeah, okay, 10 bucks gets you every NES game, 10 bucks gets you every

443
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:50,385
Scott: SNES.".

444
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,910
Scott: You know, huge bundles for low prices on the oldest games in big, you know, like that.

445
00:24:56,651 --> 00:25:02,230
Rym: Yeah, or, you know, do NES games free just because you gotta have something free so people just buy this thing outright.

446
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:08,110
Scott: You can put the greatest NES hits on there for free, all the ones people really want to play, and then all the rest in a bundle for 10 bucks.

447
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:19,550
Rym: Or what I would do is make a subscription model where, you know, NES games free, whatever, but everything else-- Oh, Spotify, $5 a month, and as soon as you stop paying, all the games go away?

448
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:24,170
Rym: Yep, 5 or 10 bucks a month, you know, a relatively small amount, but not just on that device.

449
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:27,985
Scott: If you pay for that, you log into a computer, it works on your computer.

450
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:31,810
Rym: Every device that they make or that is open.

451
00:25:32,112 --> 00:25:34,330
Scott: Wii, PC, DS, everything.

452
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,470
Rym: Hell, with them, I would try to make a deal with Microsoft and get it all in the XBLA, but you gotta pay 10 bucks a month for it.

453
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,250
Scott: I would make a controller that can work with Netflix and try to get the games into Netflix.

454
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:46,450
Rym: Oh, that would be eminently doable.

455
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,110
Rym: The Roku could probably do it.

456
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:48,750
Scott: No shit.

457
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:51,329
Rym: The thing is, Nintendo is married-- So they're old games.

458
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,430
Rym: But Scott, Nintendo is married to the hardware market.

459
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,670
Scott: They're going to be-- They're also married to the idea that games should cost a lot of money.

460
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,810
Rym: I believe Nintendo is going to be the last proprietary console in the world.

461
00:26:02,418 --> 00:26:02,670
Scott: Maybe.

462
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:07,910
Rym: I think Sony consoles, PS3, I think they're going to slowly disappear or edge toward commodity.

463
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,308
Rym: I think Microsoft eventually just-- If you buy an Xbox, it's just a PC.

464
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:21,129
Rym: Or you buy a PC that is "Xbox certified," meaning it has the, you know, whatever level of performance, and Xbox game will just work on either one.

465
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:21,690
Scott: Maybe.

466
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:26,228
Rym: And I think Nintendo is going to hold on to their proprietary bullshit until the bitter end.

467
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:33,249
Rym: But if Nintendo were smart, they would do what Sega did and turn it into an IP company primarily, and the only hardware I would sell would be portable hardware.

468
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,530
Rym: And officially licensed controllers in the shape of NES, SNES, N64, GameCube controllers.

469
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,450
Scott: That's another thing.

470
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:53,910
Rym: If Nintendo just made, like, PC-compatible USB controllers and stuff like that-- Nintendo has probably-- They're one of the few companies that has such a wealth of intellectual property that it is unnerving and ludicrous.

471
00:26:54,891 --> 00:26:56,110
Scott: And yet they don't capitalize on it.

472
00:26:57,474 --> 00:27:00,629
Scott: They should take a lesson from the ponies, and they should let Mario go free.

473
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,940
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, now that we're past the lounge.

474
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:11,565
Scott: Uh-huh.

475
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:12,334
Rym: Uh-huh.

476
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:27,220
Rym: So remember a long time ago I made a thing of the day, Garfield minus Garfield, which was basically someone was taking every Garfield comic, erasing Garfield, just leaving John, and that was the comic.

477
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:35,840
Rym: And it turns out that Garfield without Garfield is not only funnier than Garfield, but it's one of the better comics I've ever read.

478
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:36,900
Scott: I wouldn't say that.

479
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,140
Rym: There's something great about it.

480
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,703
Rym: It's basically the story-- It gets in.

481
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,740
Scott: It's the same thing over and over again.

482
00:27:40,881 --> 00:27:43,260
Rym: It's a little-- It's not really the same thing over and over.

483
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:45,060
Rym: I was reading through it again, and it cracks me up.

484
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,100
Rym: It's just basically one man's descent into lonely madness.

485
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:48,829
Scott: Yeah.

486
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:56,399
Rym: But-- So this is obviously a borderline fair use, something we were just talking about.

487
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,700
Rym: Well, it was announced at Comic-Con, and this is all legit.

488
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:06,991
Rym: Jim Davis thinks that Garfield minus Garfield is hilarious, and Ballantine Books and Paws,

489
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:07,837
Rym: Inc.,

490
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:17,680
Rym: Random House, everyone got together, and Garfield minus Garfield is being released as a legit book with all the blessings of the people who own the Garfield copyright and Jim Davis.

491
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,260
Scott: Does any of that money go to the guy who came up with Garfield minus Garfield, or does all of it go to Jim Davis?

492
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,276
Rym: It looks like it's going to the people who made Garfield minus Garfield and everybody.

493
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,800
Rym: They're all getting money.

494
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:32,420
Rym: It's a legit, straight-up just deal that they made.

495
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,040
Scott: So here's the thing.

496
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,493
Scott: This might sound a little extreme, right?

497
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,939
Scott: But actually, I would say I would have no problem with all the money going to the guy who came up with the Garfield minus Garfield, because think of it this way.

498
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,085
Rym: No.

499
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:48,119
Scott: If you're Andy Warhol and you do Campbell's Soup cans, how much money should go to Campbell's Soup?

500
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:49,980
Scott: Zero dollars, right?

501
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:56,520
Scott: You wouldn't have a problem with that, so why would you have a problem-- You know, who here thinks money should go to Campbell's Soup because of Andy Warhol selling a painting?

502
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,738
Rym: Put your hand down, Chef Boyardee.

503
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:01,420
Scott: Right?

504
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:07,440
Scott: So, you know, along those lines, that is pretty much what is going on here.

505
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,776
Scott: Well, the other argument you can make is that what the guy-- I'm sure someone out there is saying, "Yeah, the Campbell's Soup should get

506
00:29:12,816 --> 00:29:12,979
Scott: money.".

507
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,960
Rym: Is that what the guy did, right, is removing Garfield from Garfield?

508
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:21,100
Rym: Because he didn't have the rights to it, and because it was-- You'd have to argue whether or not it was parody.

509
00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:24,239
Rym: So what if someone makes parody of your work?

510
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:27,279
Rym: that consists of nothing but your work with something removed?

511
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:33,800
Rym: If you take your own work and remove the same thing, is that your copyright or that person's copyright?

512
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,600
Scott: It's-- What part of it is copyrighted?

513
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,679
Scott: The original copyright.

514
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:46,200
Scott: You know, the original artwork is-- You know, it's-- Any piece of art has parts, and you can't just get a copyright for the whole thing.

515
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,500
Scott: It's, you know, artwork-- You know, look at movie credits, right?

516
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:51,259
Rym: That's because different people make those things.

517
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,359
Rym: If I publish a comic that I wrote and drew, it's my copyright for the entire work.

518
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:58,980
Rym: Not separated between the different bits.

519
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,640
Scott: That is true.

520
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:05,559
Scott: But now if I remove, say, Spider-Man from Spider-Man, I take a Spider-Man comic, and I erase all the Spider-Mans, right?

521
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:10,800
Scott: You get credit for all of it except for the removal of the Spider-Mans, which is mine.

522
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,260
Rym: Yeah, so how do we sort out the money situation there?

523
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:21,400
Scott: I'm not really gonna be making money on it because I don't think you should be able to do anything commercial with a fair use.

524
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,240
Rym: Otherwise, it's not so fair.

525
00:30:22,606 --> 00:30:23,160
Rym: Here's my argument.

526
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,880
Rym: I think you should, but it should be just like music.

527
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:27,040
Rym: Statutory royalties.

528
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,740
Scott: Statutory royalties, fine.

529
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:39,940
Rym: Because I think the benefit of anyone being able to use anyone's intellectual property, but if they do it commercially, they're forced to pay, I think that would cause more works to be made than any other alternative.

530
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,040
Scott: Yeah, 'cause imagine if YouTube, instead of you got a takedown notice, you had PayPal $1 to have this video go back up.

531
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:46,347
Scott: Yeah.

532
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:51,220
Rym: Actually, that would probably make a lot of people who make music a lot of money.

533
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,120
Rym: Probably more money than they make from album sales.

534
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:55,119
Rym: Yeah.

535
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:56,300
Rym: Food for thought, but anyway.

536
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,999
Scott: Or like instead of a dollar, it could be like a tenth of a cent per view.

537
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:04,399
Rym: Oh, that could get bad really quick though, but then again, that's only for commercial use.

538
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,040
Scott: Exactly.

539
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:14,359
Scott: If you have ads on the video or something like that, if the video is not making you any money, then it's just in your channel for free with no ads on it, then you don't have to pay anything.

540
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,800
Rym: So anyway, Garfield Minus Garfield, the book is coming out on the 30th anniversary of Garfield.

541
00:31:18,982 --> 00:31:19,437
Scott: Do you want it?

542
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,660
Rym: Kinda, actually.

543
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,599
Scott: Then pre-order it on Amazon.

544
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,618
Rym: I probably will.

545
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:28,699
Rym: I'm reading through Garfield Minus Garfield again online, and I really dig this.

546
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,160
Rym: There's one where John just is crying alone in his house for three panels.

547
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,600
Scott: Oh wow, if you search for it on Amazon, the first listing is Garfield Minus Garfield paperback.

548
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:42,139
Scott: The second listing is the same thing again.

549
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,600
Scott: The third listing is Perry Bible Fellowship Almanac.

550
00:31:45,523 --> 00:31:46,259
Scott: Similar humor.

551
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,475
Scott: And then Bunny Suicides.

552
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:51,529
Rym: I laugh at Garfield Minus Garfield for a lot of the same reasons.

553
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,920
Rym: I laugh at the Perry Bible Fellowship.

554
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:56,319
Scott: Oh, it actually says Garfield Minus Garfield by Jim Davis.

555
00:31:57,688 --> 00:31:57,897
Rym: Huh.

556
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,000
Rym: Interesting.

557
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,657
Scott: Oh no, with a forward by Don, whatever, creator of Garfield Minus Garfield.net.

558
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:07,540
Scott: They didn't give him a credit.

559
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:10,960
Rym: I didn't read the full details.

560
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:13,020
Scott: I'm looking at the book on Amazon, that's why I found this.

561
00:32:13,882 --> 00:32:14,879
Rym: Anyway, I just think this is cool.

562
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:17,840
Scott: So Alan Moore, he's off and grumpy.

563
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:19,255
Scott: And crazy.

564
00:32:21,687 --> 00:32:22,153
Rym: Skies blue.

565
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,548
Scott: But he has an interview with him.

566
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:26,040
Scott: that's actually pretty damn good.

567
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:36,359
Scott: They ask him about a lot of stuff, and he just gives answers, and he's not that disagreeable, I think because they don't ask him, they don't dive in on things, you know.

568
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,999
Scott: But you learn a lot about Levi's Ordinary Gentleman, what he's up to, and what he's thinking.

569
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,507
Scott: Huh.

570
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:48,420
Scott: And it's probably one of the best Alan Moore interviews I've read, because it's the least crazy, and it's just a normal, good, high quality interview.

571
00:32:49,288 --> 00:32:50,600
Rym: Do they focus on anything in particular?

572
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,199
Scott: He talks about why his magazine is on hold and stuff like that.

573
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:54,613
Scott: Alright.

574
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,939
Scott: And the last question they ask him, because he's a UK guy, obviously, right?

575
00:32:59,203 --> 00:32:59,418
Scott: Okay.

576
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,135
Scott: The last question they ask him is about how they're cutting money for libraries, and he's like, "Oh, it's indefensible, blah, blah,

577
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:06,579
Scott: blah.".

578
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:14,312
Scott: And the very last thing he says in the whole interview, which is what's really awesome, Is, "I gotta go

579
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:14,596
Scott: now.".

580
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:22,560
Scott: No, he's like, "I'm all in favor of anti-cuts demonstrations, and it's always very pleasing to see so many V for Vendetta masks in the crowd.

581
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:24,397
Scott: I'm very proud of those boys and

582
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:24,579
Scott: girls.".

583
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:34,280
Scott: It's like, well, I'm sure he likes that they're protesting against government cutting libraries.

584
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:44,880
Rym: I would say more that he probably likes the fact that people were, at least to some degree, affected by either his comic or the movie he hated based on his comic.

585
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:45,087
Rym: Yeah.

586
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:49,779
Scott: You know, he would say about that movie that it doesn't exist, much like you say.

587
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:50,336
Scott: Yeah.

588
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:51,979
Scott: Many things don't exist.

589
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,460
Rym: Well, I mean, the sad truth is that M. Night Shyamalan died before he made the Avatar Airbender movie.

590
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,600
Scott: But isn't he making something else, or is that like how Tupac makes more music?

591
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:08,080
Rym: It's funny, because Tupac has come up in three unrelated conversations in the last week with me.

592
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:08,539
Scott: Really?

593
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:08,927
Rym: Yeah.

594
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,760
Rym: Like, a co-worker.

595
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:12,500
Scott: Fine, it's how Elvis makes more music.

596
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:12,583
Scott: Okay.

597
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,293
Rym: Elvis did come up last week.

598
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:17,199
Scott: Okay, sure.

599
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:18,219
Scott: They're famous.

600
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,996
Scott: They're gonna come up.

601
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:25,320
Rym: Tupac, to be honest, I didn't know who Tupac Shakur was until he died.

602
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:25,958
Scott: Really?

603
00:34:26,282 --> 00:34:26,860
Rym: I just didn't know.

604
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,639
Scott: I knew who he was because on the school bus, they played radio stations that played his music.

605
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,757
Scott: So I knew who he was.

606
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,600
Rym: Ah, our school bus didn't play the radio.

607
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,760
Scott: Whoa, that must have been boring as all fuck.

608
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,177
Rym: You know what?

609
00:34:37,382 --> 00:34:38,599
Rym: I had a Walkman.

610
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,478
Scott: Yeah, I didn't bring a Walkman to school.

611
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:41,139
Scott: And a Game Boy.

612
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:42,860
Scott: I didn't bring that to school either.

613
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,958
Rym: I brought them both to school.

614
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:44,388
Rym: Oh.

615
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,339
Rym: Also, my mom's cell phone.

616
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,119
Scott: You mean a Game Gear.

617
00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:49,300
Rym: I wouldn't bring the Game Gear to school.

618
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,148
Rym: It was like 200 bucks.

619
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,239
Rym: That was more money than I could conceive.

620
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,280
Rym: So in the meta moment, we are going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle in about a month.

621
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:04,378
Rym: Oh shit, and then you know what?

622
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,780
Rym: Seven months from now, Penny Arcade Expo in Boston.

623
00:35:08,502 --> 00:35:08,797
Rym: Oh shit.

624
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:13,840
Rym: The biggest thing we can announce is that we're doing our panel, a new panel, Discover the Forgotten Masters.

625
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:23,159
Rym: But independently, we're doing something different involving teaching large groups of people to play board games, German style board games like Modern Art and Agricola.

626
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:32,940
Rym: So if this goes well, and you'll want to check this out, there's basically a tabletop workshop room being run by the people who run the tabletop department.

627
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:34,232
Scott: Was this 100% confirmed?

628
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,140
Rym: The workshop room is confirmed.

629
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:37,580
Rym: Okay.

630
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,419
Rym: There's all this stuff that's going to be going on in there.

631
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,240
Rym: It's kind of an experiment.

632
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:50,160
Rym: And if it goes well at PAX Prime, the hope, and this is just me speculating now, don't take this to be anything official from Penny Arcade because we are just speakers.

633
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,160
Rym: We're not in any way affiliated with them otherwise.

634
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:56,999
Rym: We'll be bigger, more intense at PAX East because there's more space there.

635
00:35:58,081 --> 00:36:02,820
Rym: And most of the indie RPG people live over here on our coast, the best coast.

636
00:36:03,482 --> 00:36:05,379
Rym: And it's easier to get them to go and do stuff.

637
00:36:05,923 --> 00:36:08,539
Scott: East coast is best coast, rhyming with best doesn't make you best.

638
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:12,439
Rym: Well no, because it's the west coast and the best coast.

639
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:13,159
Scott: That's right.

640
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,198
Rym: I guess there is a coast at the bottom too.

641
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,256
Scott: What?

642
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:19,980
Rym: I mean, Texas has that coastline.

643
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,601
Scott: What?

644
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:22,840
Scott: It's not even in the country.

645
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:38,240
Rym: So yeah, otherwise, book club, own show, join the forum, follow our Twitter, follow the GeekNights Rym and the GeekNights YouTube channels, or YouTube accounts, because both of them will have stuff coming in a big way.

646
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:47,379
Rym: I should have probably in the next few days at latest game mechanics and mechanism design as we ran it at PAX East last year.

647
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:51,720
Rym: I should also relatively soon have How to Win at Games up.

648
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,100
Rym: And we're going to try to start putting pretty much all of our lectures online.

649
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,099
Scott: Yeah, we're about to go to PAX and do another one.

650
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,320
Rym: Yeah, and we're going to film it and try to get it online.

651
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:01,640
Scott: And then Magfest is coming.

652
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:09,600
Rym: I'm trying to get out of the plan we used to do of do like three panels at PAX East and then do the same three at Prime.

653
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,300
Rym: Because, I don't know, I want to do more.

654
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,779
Rym: Like the ideas we have for panels are starting to outstrip the new conventions we have and we've got too many old cons that want the same old stuff every year.

655
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:25,000
Rym: Luckily, Magfest, I think, is going to let us do exactly what we want.

656
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,355
Rym: Hopefully.

657
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,899
Rym: Yep, and Comic Con, all that stuff is coming up.

658
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,219
Scott: I can't really announce anything yet.

659
00:37:30,543 --> 00:37:31,818
Scott: Lots of stuff is coming up.

660
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,419
Scott: It's our e-commerce situation.

661
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,859
Rym: I don't have new t-shirts yet.

662
00:37:35,222 --> 00:37:35,309
Scott: Okay.

663
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:37,216
Scott: I don't know.

664
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:37,771
Scott: That's it?

665
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,479
Scott: What about the worst webcomic contest?

666
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,259
Scott: Oh, right!

667
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,560
Rym: The worst webcomic contest.

668
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:42,979
Rym: When should we set the deadline?

669
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,240
Scott: Whenever we do the episode.

670
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,940
Rym: When should we do the episode?

671
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,540
Scott: The next time we need a Wednesday episode and we don't have one.

672
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:50,595
Rym: Alright.

673
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,340
Rym: We'll probably have, I don't know, within a month or so.

674
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,537
Rym: I'll tell you what.

675
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,420
Rym: Submit your non-control alt-delete entries soon.

676
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:04,540
Rym: Because if two people submit the same comic, whoever submitted it first wins if that comic wins.

677
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:08,760
Rym: Also, you can stop submitting control alt-delete.

678
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,459
Rym: We got it.

679
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:10,280
Scott: We said that already.

680
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:11,438
Rym: I got to make sure.

681
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:16,460
Rym: The level of hate you guys have for CAD is kind of amazing.

682
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,400
Scott: I never even really read it, so I'm going to have to figure out what this hate is all about as part of the episode.

683
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,000
Rym: Well, as far as I can tell, it's about Doomguy and he cries in a hospital.

684
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,017
Scott: Doomguy?

685
00:38:27,363 --> 00:38:28,898
Scott: Someone posted- Doomguy doesn't cry.

686
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,900
Scott: He doesn't even have eyes.

687
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:36,880
Rym: There were mashups of the comic where control alt-delete famously had a very special control alt-delete.

688
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:37,859
Scott: Okay.

689
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,300
Rym: Where he kind of went into dark, serious, real world stuff out of nowhere.

690
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:43,000
Scott: Alright.

691
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,158
Rym: Personal stuff.

692
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,660
Rym: And people mash up that comic with Doomguy or My Little Pony.

693
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,347
Scott: Oh, whoa.

694
00:38:50,061 --> 00:39:00,860
Scott: So a guy makes like, it's one thing to mash up a penny arcade, but it's like if they made a very serious penny arcade that was like, you know, someone died and they made like a, you know, something.

695
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,236
Scott: The last time they did that- The thing is when penny arcade does that, like Gary Gygax dies, they make a joke about it.

696
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,040
Scott: Rolling in his grave.

697
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:12,420
Scott: Yeah, but at the same time- Like they already made the joke on it, but if they did it actually seriously, like- Well, because look at what they did.

698
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,600
Rym: If you make a joke like that, that's the kind of joke where Gary Gygax, where he's still alive, would laugh.

699
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:17,839
Scott: He would love that shit.

700
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,800
Scott: I bet he is rolling in his grave because he said he's rolling in his grave.

701
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,480
Rym: Yeah, because seriously, as much as we rag on- As much as we rag on D&D, Gary Gygax is kind of a god.

702
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:27,295
Scott: Kind of.

703
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:33,050
Rym: So, like we said, shows about horror.

704
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:36,558
Rym: So Frank Miller is famous for a lot of- Okay.

705
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:42,400
Rym: Yeah, so I was saying horror, and then I realized it kind of sounds like whore.

706
00:39:42,868 --> 00:39:43,100
Scott: Sure.

707
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,664
Rym: And I was going to make a joke about that, but no.

708
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:50,440
Rym: We're actually kind of, like we both are into horror as a genre.

709
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,518
Scott: Kind of.

710
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,001
Rym: Kind of.

711
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:58,420
Rym: I've gotten out of it as I've gotten older because I've become jaded by it, and things that used to scare me don't scare me anymore.

712
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,202
Scott: Well, it's weird.

713
00:39:59,322 --> 00:40:00,566
Scott: It's like this total reversal.

714
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:07,920
Scott: When I was really little, I wouldn't watch anything that was supposed to be scary or might have been scary- Oh, you're like the Bill Cosby, like the chicken heart that hit New York City?

715
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:20,200
Scott: Yeah, like even stuff that maybe wasn't actually scary, but appeared to have scariness in it based on the cover or the title or who knows what, I would avoid.

716
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:31,700
Rym: Well, did you ever have this situation where you'd be in Blockbuster, Mammoth Video, and you walk into the horror section, and all the covers are like skeleton with daggers coming out of its eyeballs?

717
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,359
Scott: I don't remember that really.

718
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:33,741
Rym: Really?

719
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:42,500
Rym: Because in the '80s, every horror movie had a particular graphic design on the cover that was particularly horrifying to a six-year-old.

720
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,308
Scott: For me, it was more like I was really little, and he'd be like,

721
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:45,810
Scott: "Alien.".

722
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,552
Scott: I'd be like, "Oh, shit.

723
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:47,575
Scott: I ain't watching that

724
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:48,578
Scott: motherfucker.".

725
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:54,758
Scott: But then eventually, it was just like, "Yeah, I can watch anything, and it's not

726
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:55,260
Scott: scary.".

727
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,561
Rym: Yep.

728
00:40:56,102 --> 00:41:01,320
Rym: See, I had a slightly different experience from most people because my mom- Actually, both my parents were really into horror.

729
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,134
Scott: My mom is really into horrors.

730
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:13,040
Rym: But as a result, I was reading Lovecraft probably early to mid-elementary school.

731
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,830
Scott: I don't think my mom really knows who Lovecraft is, but she's into the more generic horror.

732
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:20,119
Scott: She loves vampires, but she's like, "Fuck that Twilight

733
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:20,400
Scott: shit.".

734
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:21,879
Scott: She's like- Nosferatu style.

735
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,120
Scott: Yeah, she's like some black and white real Dracula who shreds you up.

736
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:26,750
Rym: Bleh.

737
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:37,741
Rym: Of my early literature when I was reading books, the two real-deal long books that I read- Monster Blood, Monster Blood 2.

738
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:44,060
Rym: Were The Hobbit and Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, which was a collection of short horror stories.

739
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,310
Scott: Oh, you remember those fucking books?

740
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:47,777
Scott: Scary Stories 1, 2, 3 in a Box?

741
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,243
Rym: Oh, my God.

742
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:51,231
Rym: The stories weren't that scary.

743
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:53,520
Rym: The art scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.

744
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:02,520
Rym: There's something about that- But was it that you were scared of those books and then you overcame it?

745
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,244
Scott: I think it was pretty much.

746
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:09,900
Scott: My memory is that those books were there because they were popular and I didn't want to go near them because I thought they were scary.

747
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,960
Scott: But then I eventually bought them and read them and then they weren't scary.

748
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:14,986
Rym: Well, they were kind of funny.

749
00:42:15,026 --> 00:42:16,719
Rym: now that I read them again because I have all three.

750
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,385
Scott: They're really stupid.

751
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:18,294
Scott: I have the little box set.

752
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:18,800
Scott: They're stupid.

753
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,820
Rym: Some of them were creepy for how they were portrayed.

754
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,240
Scott: I'd have to go back, but I imagine it's a He-Man situation.

755
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,980
Rym: There's one weird one, Mattai Dotey Walker.

756
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,599
Scott: How do you remember these things?

757
00:42:29,804 --> 00:42:31,260
Rym: How do you not remember anything?

758
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,020
Scott: Why would I remember some books I read when I was in fifth grade?

759
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,180
Rym: Scott, name more than three characters from, I don't know, Foundation, the book you just read.

760
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:43,438
Scott: Harry Selden.

761
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,455
Rym: All right, Harry Selden.

762
00:42:46,504 --> 00:42:47,780
Scott: The guy who's a traitor.

763
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,439
Rym: Yeah, traitor or traitor.

764
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,076
Scott: Traitor.

765
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:52,339
Rym: What's his name?

766
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:52,977
Scott: I don't know.

767
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,416
Scott: No?

768
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,240
Scott: If you told me it, I would say that's the one.

769
00:42:55,661 --> 00:42:57,179
Rym: Who was the newspaper guy?

770
00:42:58,122 --> 00:42:59,059
Scott: The newspaper guy.

771
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,879
Scott: Yeah, what was his name?

772
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:01,059
Scott: Newspaper guy.

773
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,879
Rym: Name any girl.

774
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,320
Scott: There really weren't any girls.

775
00:43:05,662 --> 00:43:06,710
Rym: That was my joke.

776
00:43:07,013 --> 00:43:07,839
Rym: I was building up to that.

777
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,200
Rym: I was like, who was the girl in Foundation?

778
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:10,778
Scott: There weren't.

779
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,639
Rym: Who was the girl in Asimov?

780
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:21,040
Rym: But yeah, I was reading and watching horror from an extremely young age.

781
00:43:22,604 --> 00:43:23,330
Rym: I keep saying H.P.

782
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:23,653
Rym: Lovecraft.

783
00:43:23,673 --> 00:43:24,540
Rym: In this case, Albert Tishcock.

784
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,939
Scott: I didn't know Lovecraft was until I got to college.

785
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,980
Rym: Yeah, but me and Greg were the ones who were really into Lovecraft before we got to RIT.

786
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,979
Scott: Alex knew about Lovecraft.

787
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,799
Rym: Yeah, of course Alex.

788
00:43:32,382 --> 00:43:32,640
Scott: Anyway.

789
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:40,040
Rym: But I was just really into horror my whole life and I remember Night of the Living Dead and all the Jason movies and the Freddy movies.

790
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,559
Scott: Yeah, I actually didn't watch those when I was very young.

791
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:45,359
Rym: Really?

792
00:43:45,683 --> 00:43:45,770
Scott: Yeah.

793
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,309
Rym: You ever seen all of them?

794
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,700
Rym: Have you seen Halloween?

795
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,476
Scott: Which ones?

796
00:43:49,663 --> 00:43:50,060
Scott: Halloween?

797
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,033
Rym: Really?

798
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:52,900
Rym: I don't know.

799
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:53,619
Rym: Don't remember Halloween?

800
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,310
Scott: Maybe.

801
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,610
Rym: That's the one that has the...

802
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,440
Scott: If I saw it, I saw it on TV in high school on HBO or something.

803
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,479
Scott: Or something like that.

804
00:44:04,203 --> 00:44:07,320
Rym: Do you remember a movie that you actually did see that scared you as a kid?

805
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,119
Scott: Yeah, Boogity.

806
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:08,786
Rym: Mr.

807
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:09,115
Rym: Boogity?

808
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:09,836
Scott: Boogity.

809
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:10,978
Scott: Boogity.

810
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,989
Scott: No, all I remember from it... Boogity Boo.

811
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,480
Scott: These are the scenes I remember from it in my brain.

812
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,439
Scott: I don't know if these were real scenes from it or not.

813
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:19,379
Rym: They're just my memory, right?

814
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,040
Rym: Alright, this ought to be good.

815
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,120
Scott: They're like in a kitchen and there's a scary cape and a hat on the coat rack.

816
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:24,736
Rym: Yup.

817
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,599
Scott: Okay, that's a real memory?

818
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:26,983
Rym: Yup.

819
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,580
Scott: Guy floating down the hallway covered in a blanket but he's floating.

820
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,105
Scott: Yup.

821
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,411
Scott: And he's saying, "Boogity,

822
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:33,815
Scott: Boogity.".

823
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,420
Scott: Just kidding.

824
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,899
Scott: Because if you say it three times, he shows up like Beetlejuice.

825
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:39,500
Rym: Yeah, or it's him possessing you.

826
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,180
Rym: I kind of forget.

827
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,540
Rym: I remember when the ghosts show up and the housewife in the family doesn't know what to do.

828
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,979
Rym: So she invites him in for coffee and she's not sure if they can drink coffee.

829
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,880
Scott: And I remember some scene at a carnival at night outside.

830
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,840
Rym: That, I think, was also the sequel.

831
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:55,699
Scott: Oh, okay.

832
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:56,266
Rym: Yeah.

833
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:58,470
Rym: I remember the end where they suck Mr.

834
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,060
Rym: Boogity up with the shop vac.

835
00:45:00,705 --> 00:45:01,480
Scott: I do not remember this.

836
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:01,755
Scott: Really?

837
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,261
Rym: There's something... Mr.

838
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:06,380
Rym: Boogity was kind of scary to a little kid, but as an adult...

839
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:11,600
Scott: It's so weird because there were movies that were comedies that had horror elements.

840
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,240
Scott: Like say Ghostbusters.

841
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,097
Scott: Or Beetlejuice.

842
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:19,240
Scott: Ghostbusters and Beetlejuice are both comedies, but they had visually things that could be horror movies.

843
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,200
Scott: Scary ghost monster underworld stuff.

844
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,280
Scott: And both of them, at least for me.

845
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,580
Scott: But they weren't horror movies at all.

846
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,740
Scott: They weren't meant to scare.

847
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,400
Scott: They might have had some things to surprise.

848
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,138
Scott: And they had ghosts, but they were comedies straight up.

849
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,599
Rym: But when I was a kid... As a kid, this is the weird thing.

850
00:45:31,821 --> 00:45:33,680
Scott: It doesn't come across as a comedy at all.

851
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:36,500
Scott: I didn't laugh at Ghostbusters when I was a kid.

852
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,275
Rym: Ghostbusters...

853
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,619
Scott: Dickless, I didn't get that joke.

854
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,900
Rym: Well, I got it, but there were funny moments.

855
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,540
Rym: I remember laughing.

856
00:45:41,582 --> 00:45:41,939
Scott: That's true.

857
00:45:42,401 --> 00:45:43,440
Scott: This man has no dick.

858
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,399
Rym: But both Ghostbusters and Beetlejuice, I took them as straight up dramas.

859
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,840
Scott: And Ghostbusters 2 was a little scary when I was a kid.

860
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:50,820
Scott: Vigo, I was scared.

861
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,240
Rym: Yeah, Vigo was pretty creepy.

862
00:45:52,902 --> 00:45:54,080
Scott: Ghostbusters 1, I wasn't scared.

863
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:55,678
Rym: But Vigo, I was scared.

864
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,000
Rym: I took Beetlejuice at such face value.

865
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Rym: I thought it was just like a supernatural thriller.

866
00:46:01,643 --> 00:46:02,453
Scott: I didn't get that.

867
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:03,100
Rym: it was a joke.

868
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,559
Scott: I didn't get that it was a joke either.

869
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,689
Rym: Kind of like how I didn't get that.

870
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:06,700
Rym: Project Echo was a joke.

871
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,020
Rym: I was like, "Oh, she has superpowers.

872
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:08,495
Rym: Awesome.".

873
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:09,960
Scott: That's when it happens and you're a little kid.

874
00:46:10,264 --> 00:46:10,940
Scott: You get it wrong.

875
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:11,717
Rym: Kids just don't get it.

876
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,780
Rym: Don't try to beat games.

877
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,340
Rym: Just kind of don't color inside the lines.

878
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,273
Scott: Yeah, so when you're trying to show your kid something, don't show it to him before he'll get it.

879
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,540
Rym: No, show it to him before they get it because it makes for the memories that shape them into the people they are today.

880
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,619
Scott: So they can make a podcast.

881
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,088
Scott: Yeah.

882
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:36,840
Rym: I think what really scared me as a kid, originally when I was really little, like movies that would make me start were the horror movies that would show the psycho killer.

883
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:42,139
Rym: It'd always be like someone's laying on a bed and then a knife just comes up through the mattress and gets him.

884
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,260
Scott: Well, that's surprise.

885
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,760
Scott: Nobody was a little, little kid.

886
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,497
Rym: It would get me.

887
00:46:46,661 --> 00:46:47,599
Scott: Of course it would get you.

888
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:48,217
Rym: Not in the movie.

889
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,080
Rym: I'd see the movie and I'd be fine.

890
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:50,840
Rym: I'd be like, "Whatever.

891
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:51,422
Rym: Ha.".

892
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,955
Rym: And then I'd go to bed and I'd think, "What if a knife just came up through my

893
00:46:55,995 --> 00:46:56,377
Rym: mattress?".

894
00:46:57,764 --> 00:46:59,920
Scott: No, see, surprise like that, right?

895
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:00,880
Scott: The element of surprise.

896
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:01,489
Scott: Jump out and go,

897
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:01,571
Scott: "Boo.".

898
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:05,320
Scott: That actually still makes me go, "Ooh," because you're surprising someone.

899
00:47:05,482 --> 00:47:05,960
Scott: You can walk up.

900
00:47:06,462 --> 00:47:10,760
Rym: Like in "Play Dead" where they played that super fucking loud noise like a second after he turned off the lights.

901
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,380
Scott: Yeah, you can walk up behind me and grab my shoulder in the dark when I'm not paying attention.

902
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,138
Scott: I'll go, "Ah," because that's what people do.

903
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:19,880
Scott: But it doesn't scare me or cause me to lose sleep.

904
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:21,260
Rym: It's funny the different reactions.

905
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,048
Scott: It's so annoying that you go to see a lot of horror movies and all they do is jump out and go,

906
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:25,317
Scott: "Boo."

907
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,039
Scott: And it's like, "Really?

908
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,598
Scott: That's all you got is jump out and go, 'Boo?

909
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:27,884
Scott: Wow.

910
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,294
Scott: Great movie making,

911
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:29,679
Scott: guys.'".

912
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:29,941
Scott: What

913
00:47:29,961 --> 00:47:40,051
Rym: was that movie, the one that the angry James Rolfe talked about, that it was like "The Cat People" or "The Panther" or something where it built up to where there would be a jump out and go,

914
00:47:40,112 --> 00:47:40,274
Rym: "Boo?"

915
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:49,040
Rym: And then there'd be a noise like a "Boo" was going to happen, but there'd be no "Boo," and the tension wouldn't resolve, and the movie would just keep going.

916
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:59,040
Rym: I forget what movie it was, but I actually like old horror movies because they're usually more like the horror of the human situation.

917
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,080
Scott: Well, I mean, I like them, right?

918
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:05,780
Scott: They're more horrific "Twilight Zone" episodes, "Frankenstein's," "Dracula's," those sorts of things.

919
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,739
Scott: I love those old horror movies, right?

920
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:14,500
Scott: But the thing is, there really isn't a movie that causes any actual fear or horror in me.

921
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:29,100
Rym: Well, it's hard to do that because the only way to elicit actual fear, not other emotions like surprise, disgust, anything like that, but actual fear, you either have to be so immersed in the movie that what's going on is contextual.

922
00:48:29,322 --> 00:48:31,600
Scott: Like that you believe you're in danger for real?

923
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:37,200
Rym: Yeah, or you have to be a little kid and see child's play and happen to have a my buddy in the closet.

924
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,459
Scott: And believe you're in danger.

925
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,000
Rym: Yeah.

926
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,140
Scott: It's really basically, that's really what it comes down to.

927
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,200
Scott: To actually feel real fear, you have to believe truly that you are in some danger.

928
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,734
Scott: Like, you watch something with aliens in it, you got to believe that aliens are coming to get you.

929
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:51,980
Scott: That's a serious possibility.

930
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,050
Rym: What I want out of a haunted house, because I was big, I enjoyed haunted houses as a little kid.

931
00:48:56,364 --> 00:48:57,078
Rym: I loved them.

932
00:48:57,682 --> 00:48:58,840
Rym: But they never scared me.

933
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,820
Rym: And I went into them because I was obsessed with watching other people flip the fuck out.

934
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,600
Scott: I don't understand people.

935
00:49:04,701 --> 00:49:06,400
Scott: It's like they scream in a haunted house.

936
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:12,318
Rym: I'm like, like half the audience was like shrieking uncontrollably at some of the things that happen.

937
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,140
Scott: But yeah, I got played as mostly, you know, funny.

938
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,237
Rym: It is mostly funny.

939
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:17,179
Scott: It's good.

940
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:17,738
Scott: So great.

941
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:18,642
Rym: I started.

942
00:49:18,682 --> 00:49:23,080
Rym: it's much better than any haunted house that I started when the rice fell on me out of nowhere.

943
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:23,560
Rym: I start.

944
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:24,755
Rym: Oh, right.

945
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,980
Scott: They're throwing rice in everybody.

946
00:49:28,323 --> 00:49:30,200
Scott: It's sort of like, ah, rice.

947
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,839
Scott: Well, good job, guys.

948
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:32,937
Scott: Nice one.

949
00:49:34,462 --> 00:49:44,700
Rym: But I got to say, the other great thing about horror movies is that even if a kid is old enough to not really be that afraid anymore, if you got a younger brother, nothing's better

950
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:45,743
Scott: younger sibling

951
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:57,443
Rym: than taking your my buddy after he has seen and you have seen Child's Play and just put it in his closet while he's asleep, just going back to bed, not saying anything about

952
00:49:57,483 --> 00:50:01,379
Scott: wait for him to fall asleep, put the my buddy in the bed, then leave now when he wakes up.

953
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:01,968
Scott: It's there now.

954
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,259
Scott: You didn't have it there to be able to do that.

955
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,659
Rym: You suspended from the ceiling over.

956
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,679
Scott: That's for an A plus grade.

957
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,125
Rym: Yeah.

958
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,620
Rym: Even better, though, you put it in the closet, right?

959
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,360
Rym: Because then there's no evidence that you did anything.

960
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:21,175
Rym: Even for the parents, they won't remember whose closet it was in or why it moved or whatever.

961
00:50:21,482 --> 00:50:22,640
Rym: You basically get away scot free.

962
00:50:23,202 --> 00:50:24,239
Rym: You put it in his bed.

963
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:25,416
Rym: You're going to get caught.

964
00:50:26,282 --> 00:50:28,340
Rym: So it's better not get caught.

965
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:28,957
Scott: What's going to happen?

966
00:50:29,804 --> 00:50:30,979
Scott: Oh, I put a toy in his bed.

967
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:31,594
Scott: Bad me.

968
00:50:32,022 --> 00:50:32,340
Scott: I don't know.

969
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:38,980
Rym: When I was a little kid, there was this general of wanting to avoid punishment, even if punishment was never actually forthcoming for anything.

970
00:50:39,632 --> 00:50:39,800
Scott: Yeah.

971
00:50:40,181 --> 00:50:41,219
Rym: You know, Bill Cosby style.

972
00:50:42,602 --> 00:50:47,277
Scott: If I have kids ever, I'll be very just with them and they won't get in trouble for doing something like that.

973
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,320
Rym: They actually want justice, not just quiet.

974
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:50,860
Scott: That's right.

975
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,200
Scott: You know, I want justice, but I also want quiet.

976
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:53,593
Rym: Yeah.

977
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:55,920
Rym: I think when those two, that'll be burning wheels style.

978
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,960
Rym: Your belief will be justice before quiet.

979
00:50:58,283 --> 00:51:00,160
Rym: You'll have to choose between justice and quiet.

980
00:51:00,444 --> 00:51:00,978
Scott: I'll take both.

981
00:51:01,844 --> 00:51:02,818
Scott: I'll have my cake and eat it too.

982
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:12,484
Scott: You realize burning wheel, the equivalent of that is failing because the thing I think adults don't realize is that even though it might take 10 minutes to get justice, justice brings quiet.

983
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:16,919
Scott: because once they realize, you know, because the kids get, they see up the fair thing was done.

984
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,276
Scott: And they'll stop yelling, complaining and say, why, why?

985
00:51:20,356 --> 00:51:21,040
Scott: no, you're there.

986
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,620
Scott: They're yelling and screaming because they're not getting justice.

987
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:27,439
Scott: If you give them the justice, it takes five minutes then.

988
00:51:27,843 --> 00:51:28,319
Scott: Not always.

989
00:51:28,523 --> 00:51:29,580
Rym: When I was a little kid, right?

990
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:38,235
Rym: My little brother one day comes into my room like we're supposed to be in bed and he comes into the room and he puts his arm out and he starts punching himself in the arm until he has a bruise.

991
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:38,780
Scott: Yup.

992
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:44,139
Rym: Then he screams, and I got in so much shit.

993
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,979
Scott: But that's because he wasn't looking for justice.

994
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:48,687
Scott: Yeah.

995
00:51:49,202 --> 00:51:49,640
Scott: She was required.

996
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,700
Rym: Scott, would you ever believe a kid who said, yeah, he punched himself until he got a bruise.

997
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,640
Scott: No, but I would take the time to explain it to them, right?

998
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:02,559
Scott: For that, look, this is the evidence I have and I'm, I'm the judge and the jury cause we don't have a judge and a jury.

999
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:02,928
Scott: Right?

1000
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:17,959
Scott: So I'm like, look, if I, if this is all the evidence I have to go on, right, what ruling can I possibly make, you know, and explain to them why that whatever ruling I have to hand down and sentence, you know, so that they're, they can't really complain beyond that.

1001
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:19,360
Scott: And I'm like, look, it's out of my hands.

1002
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,320
Scott: I want justice, but that's all I can do because that's the only information I have.

1003
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:29,936
Scott: Does anyone want to submit any evidence, you know, and it's like testimony is not evidence because you could be lying and we don't have lie detectors or bullshit.

1004
00:52:29,997 --> 00:52:34,179
Scott: and you know, it's like you take the time to explain this and then what can they possibly do?

1005
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:39,639
Scott: You know, they'll be like, oh, you had the best justice you could get given our limited resources.

1006
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:40,975
Scott: So shut up.

1007
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:47,320
Rym: So, uh, horror, cause I guess we got onto child rearing, which we're both experts on.

1008
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:52,080
Rym: So what's your favorite horror?

1009
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,939
Scott: My favorite horror.

1010
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,120
Rym: Maybe separate from the best, like your favorites.

1011
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:02,316
Scott: Some I guess, you know, so something that would be called horror that

1012
00:53:02,336 --> 00:53:18,040
Rym: I like a genre or a work like one of my, to this day, I really like Stephen King's skeleton crew because it's a bunch of short stories and they're all very mundane situations turned horrific by strangeness going on that is unexplained or ill explained.

1013
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:28,499
Rym: Like one of them was called where the deer are and a girl wakes up to go to school and just no one's around and there's deer everywhere and just no people and that's kind of it.

1014
00:53:29,504 --> 00:53:29,800
Scott: All right.

1015
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,111
Scott: Yeah.

1016
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,380
Rym: I like that kind of like sort of existential horror.

1017
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:38,191
Rym: Like I mean, Lovecraft did that very well of you don't really know what they're afraid of.

1018
00:53:38,703 --> 00:53:39,599
Rym: You can't explain it.

1019
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,743
Rym: It's never described.

1020
00:53:41,225 --> 00:53:52,440
Rym: the best you've got is this kind of aching uneasiness that everything you've ever believed in, every everything that could possibly be to existence is meaningless and nothing matters.

1021
00:53:52,661 --> 00:53:56,420
Rym: And the best case scenario is eternal torment in some distant forgotten reality.

1022
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:58,398
Scott: I don't know.

1023
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:03,220
Rym: My favorite horrors is, I mean, each of the killer isn't horror.

1024
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:04,379
Rym: That's just like torture porn.

1025
00:54:05,762 --> 00:54:10,519
Scott: I think what I like the most is probably the sort of horror where it's like you.

1026
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:12,939
Scott: you're not sure if there really is a monster or not.

1027
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:15,059
Rym: You should read the terror.

1028
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:19,459
Scott: It's like there's people and something fucked up is happening.

1029
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,400
Scott: And it could be that the people are crazy.

1030
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:36,680
Scott: It could be that there's a person doing something like a Scooby Doo situation where, you know, Event Horizon, maybe, you know, but then there's also maybe it is really some sort of horrible monster and like it doesn't appear.

1031
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,616
Scott: But maybe sometimes you think it appears, it doesn't really, you know, and the people are freaking out.

1032
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:44,679
Rym: That would be an interesting video game to make.

1033
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:52,810
Scott: Make a story kind of base game or however you make it where like you never see the monster, but you definitely you see evidence of a monster.

1034
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:58,838
Scott: that you could in the movie leads you to interpret it as evidence of a monster or some sort of ghost or whatever it is.

1035
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:06,556
Scott: But you could potentially explain it as a person up to no good or a coincidence or the weather.

1036
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,839
Rym: What if you make a video game?

1037
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,520
Scott: Crazy person who's seeing things.

1038
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,031
Rym: Because remember Eternal Darkness had that sanity meter, but that was just like meta silliness.

1039
00:55:13,072 --> 00:55:13,460
Rym: that would happen.

1040
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,299
Scott: Yeah, it didn't work.

1041
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:28,820
Rym: What if you made a game where it's some sort of like detective mystery, let's say, but maybe you kill people or the reality that you were presented with is not always consistent and you will eventually get to the point where you start like killing monsters.

1042
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,200
Rym: But then the game kind of slowly makes you realize that they aren't monsters.

1043
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:34,317
Rym: So you're the murderer.

1044
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:42,296
Scott: Well, there's a lot of games like that already where there are some, you know, sometimes what you're looking at is a hallucination and sometimes what you're looking at is for real, right?

1045
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,700
Scott: You know, and that's because the main character is the crazy person, which I explained is one of the possibilities.

1046
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,494
Rym: It was you all along.

1047
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,259
Scott: There's plenty of movies like that, too, where sometimes you'll see the movie from a perspective of a person.

1048
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,380
Scott: And sometimes it'll be something the person seeing that's not real.

1049
00:55:55,803 --> 00:55:57,560
Scott: And sometimes it will be something that's real.

1050
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:02,999
Scott: And sometimes it'll be the person seeing something not real, but part of it was real and part of it wasn't.

1051
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,299
Scott: So like maybe they'll see a monster and attack it.

1052
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:10,359
Scott: And then when they're all done hallucinating, they'll see like evidence that they attack something.

1053
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,358
Rym: Tom Hanks was in a movie about that.

1054
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,078
Scott: What movie?

1055
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:14,780
Rym: Really?

1056
00:56:14,901 --> 00:56:15,358
Rym: You don't know.

1057
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:18,159
Rym: You don't know what I'm referring to right now at all.

1058
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:22,200
Rym: Uh, OK, well, we'll talk about that after the show.

1059
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:23,080
Rym: I'll leave that up for the listeners.

1060
00:56:23,341 --> 00:56:24,540
Scott: I probably might have seen it.

1061
00:56:25,126 --> 00:56:26,380
Rym: I almost guarantee you have.

1062
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,980
Rym: You probably don't because Tom Hanks was so young, maybe anyway.

1063
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,567
Rym: But what or like?

1064
00:56:35,607 --> 00:56:39,659
Rym: where's the movie I was just thinking of, because it then horizon kind of has it like what happened to these people?

1065
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,077
Rym: Mystery going on.

1066
00:56:41,862 --> 00:56:46,140
Scott: Oh, those are always I like because I love that when you, you know, horror, like on its own, right?

1067
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:48,099
Scott: It's like you can't really scare me.

1068
00:56:48,621 --> 00:56:49,238
Scott: Jump out and go.

1069
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,319
Scott: Boo works on me.

1070
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:51,198
Scott: Like I go, I go.

1071
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,880
Scott: Oh, but then I get surprised.

1072
00:56:53,065 --> 00:56:53,620
Scott: But it's lame.

1073
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:54,499
Scott: And I'm like, oh, big deal.

1074
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:55,919
Scott: You you you surprise me.

1075
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,798
Scott: Good job, guys.

1076
00:56:57,561 --> 00:57:02,040
Scott: And you know, I guess Gore is kind of silly at this point.

1077
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:06,519
Scott: Even the extreme each of the killer kind of stuff is kind of like, you know, low holes.

1078
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,152
Scott: So it's like horror on its own doesn't work.

1079
00:57:10,192 --> 00:57:12,759
Scott: yet to combine horror with something else that's also good.

1080
00:57:13,302 --> 00:57:15,400
Scott: And then you can get like added powers.

1081
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:15,530
Scott: Right.

1082
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:22,700
Scott: So you can combine horror with sci fi to get an alien, which is still awesome, where you combine horror with adventure or combine horror with mystery.

1083
00:57:23,223 --> 00:57:25,558
Scott: And then you get something going on.

1084
00:57:26,881 --> 00:57:31,802
Scott: And you know, what's even worse are things that are like considered horror that aren't like.

1085
00:57:31,862 --> 00:57:33,500
Scott: is a vampire movie really hard?

1086
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,340
Scott: It's like just because a vampire is sort of a monster, does that make it hard?

1087
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:40,680
Scott: You know, just because Frankenstein is a is a classic universal horror monster.

1088
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:43,040
Scott: Does that mean that any Frankenstein movie is horror?

1089
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:44,960
Scott: It's like they're another kind of silly.

1090
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:45,694
Scott: A lot of them.

1091
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,420
Rym: Yeah.

1092
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,864
Rym: So, Scott, for what you described of what you like in horror fiction is the parts that are hard.

1093
00:57:51,985 --> 00:57:54,580
Rym: You really need to read the terror.

1094
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:56,359
Rym: That book I was reading before, Dan Simmons.

1095
00:57:57,585 --> 00:57:58,419
Rym: You know what it's about, right?

1096
00:57:58,581 --> 00:57:58,663
Scott: Yeah.

1097
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,258
Scott: It's about the boat.

1098
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,680
Rym: Well, yeah, it's about well, two boats that go up into the Arctic.

1099
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:04,575
Scott: That's the Hyperion guy, right?

1100
00:58:04,676 --> 00:58:04,980
Scott: Or not.

1101
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,858
Scott: No, it's the Napoleon guy.

1102
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:07,912
Scott: Or is it?

1103
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:08,440
Scott: I don't remember.

1104
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:16,058
Rym: So the story is basically, you know, it's what happened to these people and there is a monster.

1105
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:22,220
Rym: But maybe not, I don't want to spoil anything.

1106
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,520
Rym: It is exactly everything you just said you like about horror.

1107
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:30,422
Rym: I can lend it to you, though, it kind of smells because it's an old book that I got to use bookstore.

1108
00:58:33,213 --> 00:58:34,800
Rym: But I'll reveal for everyone.

1109
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:36,940
Scott: Yeah, it is a Hyperion guy.

1110
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:39,640
Rym: Time Hanks was in Mazes and Monsters.

1111
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:40,540
Scott: Never heard of it.

1112
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:40,882
Rym: Really?

1113
00:58:40,942 --> 00:58:43,780
Rym: It's about how Dungeons and Dragons makes you go crazy and kill people.

1114
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:44,999
Scott: I never heard of this.

1115
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:51,334
Rym: You could argue that it is kind of one of the causes of the Dungeons and Dragons hysteria.

1116
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,750
Scott: I never heard of this ever.

1117
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:53,640
Scott: I didn't know there was a movie.

1118
00:58:53,861 --> 00:58:54,054
Scott: Really?

1119
00:58:54,629 --> 00:58:54,780
Scott: Nope.

1120
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,560
Rym: Maybe we should watch it and do a show on it.

1121
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,799
Scott: That sounds like a good idea.

1122
00:58:59,061 --> 00:59:00,339
Rym: It's a terrible movie.

1123
00:59:00,802 --> 00:59:01,777
Scott: I'm sure it is.

1124
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:04,640
Scott: It's from the year 1982.

1125
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,298
Scott: It's as old as us.

1126
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:05,742
Scott: Yes.

1127
00:59:06,345 --> 00:59:08,517
Rym: Tom Hanks was like twenty six when he was in it.

1128
00:59:09,481 --> 00:59:12,359
Scott: Yeah, but meanwhile, if you look at this movie, the DVD cover, it looks just like it.

1129
00:59:13,721 --> 00:59:14,323
Scott: He looks now.

1130
00:59:16,008 --> 00:59:19,641
Rym: That's a picture of him from now because they rereleased it to try to make money.

1131
00:59:19,661 --> 00:59:30,282
Scott: Oh, no, it says right here in the caption, the cover were present in the movie and the picture of Tom Hanks is far more recent than 1982.

1132
00:59:30,282 --> 00:59:32,660
Scott: I guess they just wanted to make him recognizable on the DVD cover.

1133
00:59:32,924 --> 00:59:33,700
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

1134
00:59:34,481 --> 00:59:45,660
Rym: I have a mixed relationship with Japanese horror because a lot of it is just like spooky mystery where it almost edges more toward fantasy or sci fi or torture porn.

1135
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,222
Scott: It is weird.

1136
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,360
Scott: A horror from different countries varies a great deal.

1137
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:54,199
Rym: And like how I really dig just from watching all the monster madness with James Rolfe.

1138
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,284
Rym: It seems like Spanish and like Portuguese horror and Italian horror is some of the most fun.

1139
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:01,839
Scott: Yeah, definitely the most fun.

1140
01:00:02,343 --> 01:00:03,939
Rym: Maybe not the best, but the most fun.

1141
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,439
Scott: Yeah, because it sort of has that campiness to it.

1142
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:13,300
Rym: But at the same time, it's so like allegorical and metaphorical and so overwrought.

1143
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,061
Scott: Yep.

1144
01:00:15,587 --> 01:00:18,800
Scott: Yeah, I know, but it's like every country has like these different things.

1145
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,220
Scott: I guess different things scare different people.

1146
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:21,823
Scott: Right.

1147
01:00:21,843 --> 01:00:22,397
Rym: Which makes sense.

1148
01:00:23,303 --> 01:00:26,180
Scott: But it's like they're, you know, I guess jump out and go boo scares anybody.

1149
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:32,700
Scott: But it's like in terms of the non jump out and go boo, something that might be silly to us might be frightening to, you know, another culture.

1150
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:37,260
Scott: But whereas, you know, humor seems to be a little bit more universal.

1151
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:37,742
Scott: Right.

1152
01:00:37,822 --> 01:00:43,550
Rym: But at the same time, not entirely British humor stands out very distinct from American humor.

1153
01:00:43,692 --> 01:00:44,299
Rym: It does.

1154
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:46,179
Scott: But you still laugh at the British humor.

1155
01:00:46,803 --> 01:00:46,884
Scott: Yeah.

1156
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:49,460
Rym: Whereas, you know, but is that just because of the accent?

1157
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:55,380
Rym: But if British horror would still be funny if it was just completely an American accent.

1158
01:00:55,762 --> 01:00:56,349
Scott: Why don't we do it?

1159
01:00:57,017 --> 01:00:57,260
Rym: Huh?

1160
01:00:57,441 --> 01:00:59,660
Rym: Just redo all the Monty Python stuff.

1161
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:01,620
Rym: With just normal normal.

1162
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,939
Scott: Let's just dub over Monty Python skits.

1163
01:01:04,481 --> 01:01:04,784
Rym: Huh.

1164
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:06,439
Rym: And see if people still laugh.

1165
01:01:07,322 --> 01:01:08,679
Rym: We need better voices than us.

1166
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,366
Scott: We got to act.

1167
01:01:09,487 --> 01:01:10,054
Scott: Just you act.

1168
01:01:10,721 --> 01:01:11,959
Scott: But you act without a British accent.

1169
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:12,301
Rym: Yeah.

1170
01:01:12,322 --> 01:01:13,518
Rym: We need different voices from us.

1171
01:01:15,162 --> 01:01:16,009
Rym: Of course, we did that.

1172
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:17,360
Scott: That's a Miku in Friends.

1173
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,360
Rym: We did that Shakespearean Pulp Fiction that one time.

1174
01:01:19,964 --> 01:01:20,208
Scott: Yeah.

1175
01:01:20,432 --> 01:01:20,676
Scott: Yeah.

1176
01:01:21,602 --> 01:01:23,900
Scott: Anyway, do we need to keep going with this?

1177
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,751
Rym: I haven't really seen horror recently.

1178
01:01:25,831 --> 01:01:27,120
Rym: that's gotten me going.

1179
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:31,802
Scott: Well, because I think the thing is nowadays, all the horror movies that you see, at least in the U.S.

1180
01:01:31,842 --> 01:01:36,221
Scott: that are big and popular are like these, you know, like the Saw, which I've never seen any of those.

1181
01:01:36,503 --> 01:01:40,519
Scott: But from what I can tell, it's pretty much just like, dude saws people up.

1182
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:47,150
Rym: No, it's more, you know, all the sort of like hypothetical moral situation, like, all right, you're locked in a room.

1183
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:47,798
Rym: There's another guy.

1184
01:01:48,202 --> 01:01:48,751
Rym: He's tied up.

1185
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:49,279
Rym: There's a gun.

1186
01:01:49,681 --> 01:01:52,120
Rym: The door will only unlock if the other guy dies.

1187
01:01:52,581 --> 01:01:54,600
Rym: Otherwise, you're going to be locked in there until you both starve to death.

1188
01:01:54,982 --> 01:01:55,705
Scott: How does that?

1189
01:01:55,826 --> 01:01:58,820
Scott: how do they tie those situations like that into an actual cohesive plot?

1190
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,541
Scott: Or is it just scene and then another scene and another scene and they're not related to each other?

1191
01:02:02,782 --> 01:02:04,853
Scott: They're related enough because I mean, you're not.

1192
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:06,742
Scott: you can't have just that scene for 90 minutes.

1193
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:10,020
Rym: Well, you can have a bunch of those scenes that are tied together by a flimsy plot.

1194
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,404
Scott: Yeah, the flimsy plot.

1195
01:02:11,444 --> 01:02:19,498
Rym: That's exactly what I was just saying is that I've not seen any of the Saw movies all the way through, but I've seen scenes from Saw's.

1196
01:02:21,201 --> 01:02:23,839
Scott: Would you count like Silence of the Lambs as horror in any way?

1197
01:02:24,222 --> 01:02:25,028
Rym: That you know what?

1198
01:02:25,249 --> 01:02:26,720
Rym: I would argue that that is thriller.

1199
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:33,799
Rym: Yeah, it's hard, you know, but it's like I've seen some people also say that terror is a separate genre from horror.

1200
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,899
Scott: Terror is like so many horror subgenres, too.

1201
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:45,040
Rym: I know, but they argue is one of those high level word almost doesn't even mean there's horror, terror, thriller action, which is separate from thriller.

1202
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,719
Rym: Thriller is like halfway between action and horror.

1203
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:55,840
Rym: And terror is more like like a like, I don't know, falling down could almost be because someone is terrorizing.

1204
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,580
Scott: It's true, but it's not terrifying to watch it.

1205
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,222
Rym: No, it isn't.

1206
01:03:00,925 --> 01:03:04,080
Rym: I mean, movie, I mean, terrifying Avatar, The Last Airbender.

1207
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:11,580
Scott: I like to categorize, you know, things, you know, not base, you know, because like too many people categorize things based on the aesthetic or other things like that.

1208
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:13,040
Scott: Yeah, like I got to categorize it.

1209
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,879
Rym: It's horror because it has a werewolf in it.

1210
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,780
Rym: Yeah, that's how Americans seem to do it.

1211
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:20,240
Scott: But it's like American Railroad from London, more of a Teen Wolf.

1212
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,660
Scott: It's like not hard, dude.

1213
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,649
Rym: What about Teen Boat?

1214
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:24,540
Rym: I mean, he's a wereboat.

1215
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:25,392
Rym: Does that make it horror?

1216
01:03:25,413 --> 01:03:25,494
Rym: Yeah.

1217
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,820
Scott: No, you got to categorize it based on the primary emotion that is instilled in the viewer.

1218
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:37,759
Rym: But then by that logic, that changes, Scott, by that logic, Clifford with Martin Short is clearly a horror film.

1219
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,224
Scott: Sure, whatever.

1220
01:03:40,187 --> 01:03:47,760
Scott: But, you know, but, you know, if you use that, the problem is that something might be different genres based on the viewer, not based on the contents.

1221
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:54,859
Scott: You have to judge it based on the intended emotion of the creator, the primary intended emotions of the creator.

1222
01:03:55,602 --> 01:03:55,763
Scott: Right.

1223
01:03:55,783 --> 01:03:58,259
Scott: So it was created with the intent to frighten.

1224
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,880
Scott: Even if now, 50 years later, it is is silly and corny.

1225
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:04,080
Scott: You have to put it in the horror category.

1226
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:04,802
Scott: Right.

1227
01:04:05,263 --> 01:04:11,464
Rym: But, you know, but then if we do that, I mean, the monsters movie is kind of horror.

1228
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:12,980
Scott: It wasn't intended to frighten anyone.

1229
01:04:13,445 --> 01:04:14,779
Rym: I would argue that it kind of was.

1230
01:04:15,565 --> 01:04:15,626
Rym: No.

1231
01:04:15,646 --> 01:04:16,579
Rym: When was the last time you saw it?

1232
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:16,861
Rym: All right.

1233
01:04:17,264 --> 01:04:20,200
Scott: Ernest Scared Stupid was entirely a comedy.

1234
01:04:21,703 --> 01:04:22,586
Rym: I would argue it's.

1235
01:04:23,108 --> 01:04:26,440
Rym: it fits the horror genre almost more.

1236
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,859
Rym: It's more horror than comedy, partly because Ernest P. Worrell, not funny.

1237
01:04:31,562 --> 01:04:32,266
Scott: That's for sure.

1238
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:34,460
Scott: But that's an entirely separate thing.

1239
01:04:34,901 --> 01:04:39,200
Scott: Somehow when I was a little kid, it was its intended emotion, not succeed.

1240
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:42,040
Rym: I think horror was intended in addition to comedy.

1241
01:04:43,563 --> 01:04:45,299
Scott: You could call it a horror comedy, then go nuts.

1242
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:51,166
Rym: But as a kid, for some reason, Ernest Goes to Camp was like one of my favorite movies when I was really young.

1243
01:04:51,186 --> 01:04:53,540
Scott: Never really big Ernest fan.

1244
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,159
Rym: Neither was I, except for Ernest Goes to Camp.

1245
01:04:57,183 --> 01:04:58,439
Rym: Have you seen Ernest Goes to Camp?

1246
01:04:59,343 --> 01:05:00,578
Scott: If I did, I didn't remember it.

1247
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:01,487
Rym: Really?

1248
01:05:01,507 --> 01:05:02,319
Rym: It has one pretty good...

1249
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,379
Scott: All I remember is that Ernest was this dopey guy.

1250
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,325
Scott: He was in stuff.

1251
01:05:05,688 --> 01:05:07,580
Scott: Yeah, that's all I remember.

1252
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:10,587
Scott: You gonna end on that?

1253
01:05:17,157 --> 01:05:19,280
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1254
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:24,420
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1255
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:29,840
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1256
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,760
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1257
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:37,500
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1258

1259
01:05:42,283 --> 01:05:45,340
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1260
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,460
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
