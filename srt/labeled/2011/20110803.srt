1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,500
Rym: It's Wednesday, August 3rd, 2011.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:10,761
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,770
Scott: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,237
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:16,329
Rym: Tonight, anime we should see.

6
00:00:18,217 --> 00:00:18,828
Scott: We want to see.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,658
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,754
Rym: Ah, it's so sad.

9
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:30,270
Rym: Second year in a row this past weekend was Otakon and we weren't there.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,128
Rym: It was weird.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,930
Rym: It was still, to this day, two years in a row, it is weird to not be at Otakon.

12
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:44,490
Rym: Even though almost no one I know went except for, like, you know, Anime World Order and Mike Tool and all them.

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,702
Rym: And, like, a tiny handful of the crew.

14
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,510
Rym: Almost everyone else also bailed on it, so.

15
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:51,643
Scott: People seem to follow us.

16
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:52,290
Scott: They're followers.

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,810
Scott: Plus, you know, most of the people, they're not into the, you know, the anime.

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,568
Scott: If you're not, you know, like us, doing a bunch of stuff at the anime convention, it doesn't really have anything for you as much, right?

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,279
Rym: The thing is, it could.

20
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,006
Rym: It just doesn't.

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,732
Scott: Otakon actually does.

22
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:16,730
Scott: If I didn't live in New York with no car anymore, you know, if I was still in Beacon with a car, or maybe even further south with a car, or something like that, I would probably still go to Otakon.

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,670
Rym: Would you stand in that line?

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,253
Scott: Maybe.

25
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,219
Scott: It's tough, right?

26
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,270
Scott: Because it also depends on the hotel and all that stuff.

27
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:30,290
Scott: But it's like, if Otakon was a little more convenient, I want to go because it's actually one of the only anime cons that has stuff I actually want to see.

28
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,550
Scott: Like, you know, the movies and the Japanese guests and whatever.

29
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,490
Rym: Of course, what saddens me is that the stuff I want to see currently is not what anyone else wants to see.

30
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:38,988
Rym: That's good!

31
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,430
Rym: I heard tell from multiple sources that after the Makoto Shinkai movie, there was a Makoto Shinkai-like panel.

32
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,398
Rym: And almost everybody walked out.

33
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,464
Rym: They didn't care about him.

34
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,610
Rym: They just wanted to see the premiere.

35
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,245
Scott: Yeah, well, you know, at least they saw his movie.

36
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:53,910
Scott: It's better than nothing.

37
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,830
Rym: Yeah, and the Trigun movie, people said it was okay.

38
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,397
Scott: Yeah, we'll see.

39
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,589
Scott: I wasn't there, so I don't know.

40
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:00,975
Rym: Yep, I don't know exactly.

41
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:04,630
Rym: At least Daryl got to run Anime as Crazy as Deaths.

42
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,317
Scott: I'm sure it was 100% packed house completely.

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,410
Rym: Yeah, absolutely.

44
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:09,948
Scott: Yeah.

45
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,168
Rym: I would have gone to that had I been there.

46
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,749
Scott: I would have attempted to as well.

47
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:16,194
Rym: Yeah.

48
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:19,830
Rym: I feel like it would take such a little effort to make Otakon almost twice as good.

49
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,195
Scott: Yeah, but here's the thing.

50
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,730
Scott: By my count, Otakon actually had a huge attendance jump this year.

51
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,961
Scott: To 31,000, they said?

52
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:26,770
Scott: Something like that?

53
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,770
Rym: Well, I didn't even check the official numbers yet, but they did.

54
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,500
Rym: Now that they have the Hilton, they have a much higher cap.

55
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,433
Scott: Yeah, they raised their number.

56
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:39,290
Scott: I think now, by my numbers, they might be bigger than the San Diego Comic-Con.

57
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,523
Scott: Because the San Diego Comic-Con has a number of like 140,000.

58
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:43,990
Scott: Some ungodly number, right?

59
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,066
Scott: But you don't realize, San Diego Comic-Con starts Wednesday night.

60
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:48,890
Scott: It's preview night.

61
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,850
Scott: Then it's Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

62
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:51,942
Rym: So, think about this.

63
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:52,569
Rym: They do turnstile.

64
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,317
Scott: They are multiplying that number.

65
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:57,190
Scott: That number divided by five is the real number.

66
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,750
Scott: Now, granted, when you look at videos of San Diego, the lines are way longer than Otakon lines.

67
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,270
Rym: But there are fewer headlining events that are concurrent.

68
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:09,541
Scott: And the crowds are packed much more densely.

69
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,990
Scott: But I think, I haven't been there, so I don't know.

70
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:14,919
Scott: San Diego is mostly one big room.

71
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:17,890
Scott: Imagine if everyone at Otakon was in the dealer's room the whole time.

72
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:25,230
Scott: Sure as fuck, even if that dealer's room was two or three times as big, you could be sure as hell that it would be as crowded as San Diego, right?

73
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,530
Scott: But the people at Otakon are spread out over a much wider space.

74
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:35,338
Scott: Also, you see those gigantic lines to see incredibly famous people in the infamous Hall H. Or there's a ballroom also.

75
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:37,950
Scott: that's like the second most popular room.

76
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,844
Scott: But Otakon has seven panel rooms, right?

77
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,850
Scott: I think there's some ungodly number of panel rooms and some seven video rooms.

78
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,029
Scott: And they're gigantic and there's so many of them.

79
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,850
Scott: From what I've never been to San Diego, I could be wrong.

80
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:58,710
Scott: From what I've heard other people talking about, it seems like they pretty much have the two gigantic panel rooms for famous shit and then a bunch of small ones.

81
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:09,050
Scott: So, I'm actually gonna say that by my count, as of now, Otakon is the biggest geek convention in the United States.

82
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,770
Scott: Possibly the world.

83
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,567
Rym: There's a reason why, when PAX was like, "Yeah, we're gonna have PAX

84
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:14,829
Rym: East."

85
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:15,855
Rym: And they were like,

86
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:16,519
Rym: "Boston?"

87
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,101
Rym: We were like,

88
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:17,485
Rym: "Eh.".

89
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:23,910
Scott: Yeah, and I would go to Otakon if I wasn't doing anything, if it was a little bit more convenient.

90
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,410
Scott: That's just my personal situation.

91
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,810
Rym: Yeah, but simultaneously, it's kind of like everything's going well for now.

92
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,830
Scott: It's like they could be even better with the smallest amount of effort.

93
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,593
Scott: It's so simple.

94
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,950
Rym: Just redo the screening rooms to have people actually talking about the stuff.

95
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:39,688
Scott: Mail badges.

96
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,170
Rym: Mail the badges and have a keynote.

97
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,270
Rym: Just have, you know, you've got Makoto Shinkai, get him to do a keynote.

98
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:48,665
Rym: Get Mike Toole to do a keynote.

99
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:49,290
Rym: Get someone.

100
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,154
Scott: It doesn't matter.

101
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:52,970
Scott: Get the first con chair of Otakon ever.

102
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:54,790
Scott: The person's not dead, right?

103
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,380
Rym: Jim Voll should do it, actually.

104
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,533
Rym: He's probably one of the more important- I don't know.

105
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:01,950
Scott: Yeah, he's a great guy, but I don't know what his public speaking skills are like.

106
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,410
Rym: I think he would do okay.

107
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:08,288
Scott: I'm sure he could do just fine, but, you know, it's like, is he, you know, an amazing public speaker?

108
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,010
Scott: I haven't heard him public speak.

109
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:17,170
Rym: Otakon gets the A-list of Japanese guests, and yet hardly anyone cares to even see them, except to get autographs signed.

110
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,990
Rym: Or if they're American voice actors.

111
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,110
Scott: I would just not bring the non-Japanese guests.

112
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,772
Rym: No, I would bring them anyway, but I'd bring a little bit less, and more importantly, I would do.

113
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:39,290
Rym: the one thing that the New York Anime Festival did well, if you forget the fact that they didn't actually have a translator, is, you know, they sell this big keynote thing, and they promoted the ever-living fuck out of the fact that they had Japanese guests,

114
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:39,914
Scott: and they

115
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:40,788
Rym: packed that room.

116
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,429
Scott: They sure did.

117
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,030
Rym: There is no excuse for Otakon not packing the room of at least Makoto Shinkai.

118
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:48,650
Scott: I think Otakon pushes a musical guest harder.

119
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,590
Scott: Wait, what was Otakon's musical guest this year?

120
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,249
Rym: I don't remember.

121
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:53,830
Rym: Chemistry.

122
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,190
Scott: Who's chemistry?

123
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:55,933
Scott: I don't know.

124
00:05:55,953 --> 00:06:02,850
Scott: I'll be honest, I kind of stopped paying attention after- But the thing was, Otakon had huge musical guests for multiple years in a row.

125
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:03,723
Scott: TMR, right?

126
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,970
Scott: And then, you know, chemistry may or may not be big, but I haven't heard of them.

127
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,210
Rym: Of course, we're kind of disconnected from that scene.

128
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,005
Scott: That's true.

129
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,630
Rym: I mean, we used to be much more into the anime.

130
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:18,770
Scott: I imagine they did the opener to some anime that's really popular that we don't watch.

131
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:25,409
Rym: I mean, remember back in the day when the rumors, I'd always hear people, even at RIT, being like, "Yeah, I heard Otakon got 2 Mix next

132
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:25,610
Rym: year.".

133
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,889
Scott: Yeah, I'm still waiting for the 2 Mix Ayumi.

134
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,105
Rym: Oh my god, 2 Mix Ayumi Megumi.

135
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:37,230
Scott: I don't think one of those girl groups like AKB48 or Morning Musume or Girls' Generation or some shit.

136
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,110
Rym: That would probably generate a pretty big crowd.

137
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,090
Scott: That would explode.

138
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,537
Rym: And the thing is- It'd be like, "Yeah, guess what?

139
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:44,007
Scott: We're not bringing a musical guest like a band.

140
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,474
Scott: We're bringing 48 girlies.

141
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:45,976
Scott: Watch

142
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:46,116
Scott: out.".

143
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:57,169
Rym: They'd have to do a Japanese-style talk show, like have a room where it's them poking at cats or whatever it is they make them do on TV.

144
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:57,842
Scott: I don't know.

145
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,989
Rym: But yeah, if you guys wanted us at Otakon, tell them.

146
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:13,309
Rym: If you were at Otakon and you saw good panels like Mike Tools or Daryl Sarats or Geralds or Clarissas, they have a forum where you can tell them what was a good panel.

147
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:24,222
Rym: And most importantly, the excuse that Otakon gave years in a row when we tried to get them to get Super Art Fight, which is one of the most amazing performance art.

148
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,030
Rym: that is competitive art.

149
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,950
Scott: Literal drawing, two-dimensional art I've ever seen.

150
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,961
Scott: It would be epic at Otakon or PAX.

151
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:32,610
Scott: Right now, it's epic at Kinetacon.

152
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,110
Scott: It's like, "Hey, there's a great reason to come to Kinetacon.

153
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,707
Scott: We've got Super Art Fight, which is the highest class event that isn't at the real

154
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:39,230
Scott: conventions.".

155
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:47,328
Rym: For years, before we were staff on Otakon, when we were staff on Otakon, and after we quit being staff on Otakon, we were like, "Get Super Art

156
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:47,549
Rym: Fight.".

157
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,190
Rym: It would be so ungodly popular.

158
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,090
Rym: It fills the Kinetacon main events, which is way big.

159
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:56,678
Rym: It's bigger than anime Bostons, I think.

160
00:07:58,023 --> 00:07:59,729
Rym: Seating-wise, I think it is.

161
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:01,185
Scott: Equal-ish.

162
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,604
Rym: It depends on where that partition at the back goes.

163
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:04,590
Rym: I'd have to get some numbers.

164
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,106
Scott: Tough call.

165
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,410
Rym: Yeah, I'll try to figure out if they're the same.

166
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,270
Scott: It is close.

167
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:09,709
Rym: And it's getting bigger next year.

168
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:10,290
Scott: Yep.

169
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:10,557
Scott: Yeah.

170
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,069
Scott: Then it will definitely be.

171
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,101
Rym: But their excuse was always, "Oh, we have Iron Artist.

172
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:17,390
Rym: We can't have two of the same kind of event.

173
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,407
Rym: We have a long working relationship with Iron

174
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:18,550
Rym: Artist.".

175
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:22,310
Scott: Well, we heard that Iron Artist was not at Otakon this year.

176
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,047
Rym: Yeah, in fact, Super Art Fight, I was talking to them and I was like,

177
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:25,248
Rym: "Yeah.".

178
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:28,330
Rym: They told us when we brought it up that it was because they had Iron Artist.

179
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,105
Rym: He was like, "Iron

180
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:29,270
Rym: Artist?".

181
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:33,109
Rym: And then he gets back to me and I was like, "That was definitely not on the

182
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:33,309
Rym: schedule.".

183
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:36,546
Scott: Dun dun dunnnnnn.

184
00:08:37,312 --> 00:08:37,989
Rym: So, yeah.

185
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,107
Rym: I don't know.

186
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,504
Scott: I don't know.

187
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,020
Scott: Anyway.

188
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,669
Rym: But, yeah, Super Art Fight, if you want to see them at ConnectiCon, they'll be there.

189
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,706
Rym: And if you want to see them at PAX, tell PAX.

190
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,070
Scott: Go to the PAX forums, make a thread.

191
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,650
Rym: Because we have told them, so hopefully we'll get them.

192
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,168
Scott: PAX East.

193
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,370
Scott: They're probably not going to West.

194
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,666
Scott: It's a little too close to the--.

195
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:56,550
Rym: I'll bet we could get them to go to West.

196
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,247
Rym: If the thing is West-- Not right now.

197
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,634
Rym: The problem is it'd be hard to fit them in because any West is already full to the brim-- East oh 12.

198
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:08,003
Scott: that's our pushing for central London and the cruise right anyway.

199
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:10,229
Scott: anyway speaking of conventions, right?

200
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:17,690
Scott: You know New York comic-con is coming up pretty soon and normally we don't care that much about what's going on.

201
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,553
Scott: It's your comic.

202
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:20,339
Rym: I mean with blue like our one or two panels.

203
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,195
Rym: Yeah, well do the walk around interview some people But there's actually.

204
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:29,290
Scott: there was just news someone's gonna be at the New York Comic Con.

205
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:30,256
Rym: I wonder who?

206
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,343
Scott: you wonder who?

207
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,510
Rym: I haven't looked at the Internet.

208
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:35,821
Scott: It's someone that I would wait in a long line to see.

209
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:43,929
Scott: I wouldn't pay to get the VIP badge to see them But I would wait in a long line huh, so we're gonna see how it goes down, and it's someone who?

210
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,150
Scott: They might go to other conventions, but I've never heard of them being at another convention at least not recently.

211
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:56,287
Rym: I know it's not but I'm gonna guess Lauren Faust because I can't imagine you being more excited about someone.

212
00:09:56,528 --> 00:10:00,085
Scott: no yeah Yeah, you know who it is Rainbow Dash.

213
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:03,213
Rym: no I don't know who it is.

214
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:04,056
Rym: I haven't looked at the news.

215
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:08,209
Scott: It is Franklin Miller is going to be at the New York Comic Con.

216
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,765
Scott: Really, yes really I?

217
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:13,976
Rym: Want to go to a Q&A with him.

218
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:17,070
Rym: I know right what I I'd ask him something about whores.

219
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:18,334
Rym: I'd be like.

220
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:21,390
Rym: so do you really like the aesthetic of whores?

221
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,640
Scott: I don't know what his personality is like at all.

222
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:24,665
Scott: so it's gonna be.

223
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:34,030
Rym: I know if you go You don't want to ask first I mean what if he's an Alan Moore, but at the same time I mean it's hard to say I know very little about his non-professional life.

224
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:38,277
Scott: The only thing I know about him is I read Eisner Miller Which is just basically a book.

225
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:52,230
Scott: that is a conversate that is a that is basically a written-down Recording of a conversation between him and Will Eisner, and he seemed like a nice normal guy pretty much so I Couldn't really tell his personality.

226
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:58,030
Scott: It was just a guy who was a comic expert talking about comics, so it's it doesn't really tell me about him.

227
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:05,310
Scott: But if I had to ask him a question, I would definitely ask him Robocop questions Because those would be that you know there's people are gonna ask him plenty of bad.

228
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,032
Scott: You know what that is.

229
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:12,130
Rym: That's the equivalent of we need Daryl Saratian style questions at more non-anime events.

230
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:18,370
Rym: You got to basically go into any press thing find whatever that famous person's crystal triangle is and ask about nothing.

231
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:22,751
Scott: That's right, so There you go.

232
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:31,680
Rym: so things of the day.

233
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,064
Rym: a long time ago I Bought well bought.

234
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:38,991
Rym: I basically sent VHS tapes that were sent back to me.

235
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,159
Rym: all of Sailor Moon all of it all 200 episodes.

236
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:47,800
Rym: I watched all of it and some of my friends watched all of it, and we had an inside joke.

237
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,379
Rym: This is pre front row crew.

238
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:56,065
Rym: This is like back from the day of eight people gaga and the joke was Excuse me.

239
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:58,779
Rym: What time is it now?

240
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:03,027
Scott: It's for party.

241
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:09,746
Rym: I've never heard this and then the first person would say thank you It was this ritual.

242
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:13,319
Rym: I you know friend groups you have like that ritual eyes like weird greeting like hello.

243
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:21,880
Scott: Oh Yeah, I've never heard this one before because it was my old crew like a high school But it was in Sailor Moon.

244
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:22,626
Rym: There was.

245
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:30,040
Rym: this is random scene where this guy Randomly just starts speaking in English and are there three people speaking in English?

246
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:35,400
Rym: We're hitting critical mass here inside jokes.

247
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:54,320
Rym: but uh so Sailor Moon has a wealth of scenes where random motherfuckers speaks English but it's clearly just one of the Japanese voice actors and They're always awful, so I submit for your consideration One of those scenes from Sailor Moon also.

248
00:12:54,924 --> 00:13:00,720
Rym: It's kind of a I don't know sort of an aside But you'll see this in a lot of anime like what was the old?

249
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,109
Rym: I hate the Japanese people.

250
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:05,660
Rym: all Japanese people are stupid.

251
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,209
Scott: I don't remember that was a dub of.

252
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:13,359
Rym: it was a sub of some show and a guy just says that in English Cracks an egg over another guy's head.

253
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:28,284
Rym: Anyway, so also if you haven't seen Sailor Moon at all ever It's kind of a trick to get you to look at a YouTube video that happens to kind of as the Sailor Moon looks like like for real People don't know it.

254
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:32,299
Rym: I don't think a lot of people who listen to GeekNights have actually seen Sailor Moon.

255
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:37,420
Scott: I haven't watched like a whole episode of it, but I've seen plenty of it.

256
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:38,447
Scott: I know what it looks like.

257
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,059
Scott: I can spot it from a mile away.

258
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:40,883
Rym: We'll see.

259
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:44,700
Rym: plus you might have you probably only really recognized when she is Sailor Moon as she's Sailor Moon.

260
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:46,535
Scott: No, I know when she's not Sailor Moon.

261
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,319
Scott: Ah She looks the same only without a skirt jeans and a sweater.

262
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,442
Rym: Sometimes.

263
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:53,630
Rym: sometimes she wears other things.

264
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,415
Scott: was that your thing of the day?

265
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:55,159
Rym: that was my thing of the day.

266
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:56,426
Scott: So you know what you know.

267
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:59,080
Scott: sometimes I use the webcomic as a thing of the day, right?

268
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,640
Scott: Which is also always pretty good, but the thing a lot of people don't know is that I guess they do know.

269
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:12,660
Scott: Maybe I don't know whatever Webcomic artists they draw a lot more than just their webcomic, you know, they make lots of sketches and notebooks all the time.

270
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:19,035
Rym: Yeah, like remember a lot of people don't realize or at least didn't realize before Atomic Robo that a bit theater.

271
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:24,089
Scott: Yeah, that guy can draw What anyway, Brian clever could you can draw?

272
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,755
Scott: Yeah, I didn't know that he could draw.

273
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:26,076
Scott: we can.

274
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:28,060
Rym: I'll show you some his art really anyway.

275
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,857
Scott: So it's always good if you can go and find.

276
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:36,799
Scott: for example Some artists will put theirs they'll make sketches and put them on Twitter and they'll be on Twitter.

277
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:38,450
Scott: pick Yeah, and some of them they might be on.

278
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:39,720
Scott: why frog which is the same shit?

279
00:14:40,142 --> 00:14:44,160
Scott: Some people might put him in like a Picasa or a deviant art or a something something, right?

280
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,782
Scott: Well, I found out today from some Twitter links that John Allison from scary-go-round Right.

281
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,250
Rym: Yeah, I forgot all about that comic.

282
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,196
Rym: Yeah, I really liked that comic.

283
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:56,600
Rym: I'm gonna start reading that comic again.

284
00:14:56,941 --> 00:15:04,965
Scott: So he puts his on flicker and he drew some Thundercats that are At our epic hilarity.

285
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:09,935
Scott: Oh, like I can't even say hilarious because I mean, I mean just look at this fucking snarf.

286
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,439
Rym: Oh My god that That pushes all the same buttons that like Kate Beaton art does.

287
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:16,942
Scott: well I know.

288
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:20,780
Scott: in fact Kate beaten linked it and I thought it might have been Kate beaten in the first place.

289
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,463
Scott: But no, it wasn't.

290
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:25,324
Scott: so this is a quite the excellent, you know It's a whole.

291
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:27,479
Scott: you can look through his whole flicker account is my thing of the day.

292
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,493
Scott: Oh my god, Lee is you know, it's full of gems.

293
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:31,096
Rym: I can't believe.

294
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,020
Rym: I didn't know this existed.

295
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,923
Rym: I also guess 500.

296
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:37,499
Scott: I think is 519 things in his photo stream, but specifically these two Thundercats.

297
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,744
Scott: one I can't believe.

298
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:40,954
Rym: I forgot that webcomic existed.

299
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:45,720
Rym: I think when I built my new computer I just didn't like remake the bookmark and I just kind of forgot.

300
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,920
Scott: It's actually kind of weird because if you go to scary-go-round.com, it's a scary-go-round presents bad machinery.

301
00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:53,312
Scott: I think the name of the comic is now bad machinery.

302
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:54,719
Rym: I don't know.

303
00:15:55,564 --> 00:15:56,649
Scott: I'm not sure what the deal is.

304
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:57,614
Rym: Anyway, I was I never.

305
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:58,780
Scott: I actually never read the comic.

306
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:00,319
Scott: I just know who the guy is.

307
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,200
Rym: I am sure there are long archives from the point when I forgot about it and stopped reading that I can catch up on.

308
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,015
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure man Skellington's.

309
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:15,540
Rym: So in the meta moment the Upcoming the next geek guys book club book is the ear the eye the arm.

310
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:22,520

00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,868
Rym: It came highly recommended.

312
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:24,653
Rym: it's a short read.

313
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:32,854
Scott: you should read it By the end of the month because remember Bob is its own show now Which means we're not gonna be waiting for like an appropriate Thursday.

Scott: Don't fuck that out.

343
00:17:52,215 --> 00:17:54,405
Scott: It's not Labor Day weekend this year It's the week before.

344
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:57,179

Rym: tell you on Saturday at noon We are doing discover the Forgotten Masters.

348
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,994
Scott: You gotta prepare that.

349
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,620
Rym: Yeah, we do have to prepare that.

350
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:10,342
Scott: We're all.

351
00:18:10,362 --> 00:18:11,647
Scott: we've already forgotten the master.

352
00:18:11,948 --> 00:18:13,412
Rym: We're also doing at 6 p.m.

353
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:13,693
Rym: To 8 p.m.

354
00:18:16,284 --> 00:18:18,600
Rym: I don't know what the room is going to be called.

355
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:23,020
Rym: There is a an experiment at this packs a workshop room for tabletop.

356
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:26,220
Rym: All right, we are going to be teaching people how to play.

357
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:32,240
Rym: I won't say the names of the games because we're that's not finalized yet some games probably Carcassonne.

358
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:34,054
Scott: We're not just gonna teach you how to play though.

359
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:34,740
Scott: That would be boring.

360
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:40,832
Scott: We're also you know I mean it would be useful to teach a whole room of people how to play at once Yeah, as opposed to teaching over and over again.

361
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:41,797
Rym: Yeah, that's well and good.

362
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:44,185
Rym: That's the Gonna.

363
00:18:44,245 --> 00:19:00,980
Scott: tell you how to fucking win and With the secret strategies of masters then there's probably gonna be enough copies for all y'all to just play Immediately and we'll be around to help out to judge the rules clarify rules give people, you know tips.

364
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:04,500
Scott: It's like I need a hint of where to move to make the crab people.

365
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,137
Rym: I'll tell you this and if they yell at me for telling you this now, well, I'll eat that.

366
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:08,700
Rym: That's my fault.

367
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:12,415
Rym: We're starting to spot it because that's the sleeper hit of packs.

368
00:19:12,555 --> 00:19:13,760
Scott: I think we need to get more spot.

369
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,660
Rym: It's Carcassonne seven wonders and then the fourth one in that session is secret.

370
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:24,277
Rym: It might be an indie RPG maybe might be we're not sure.

371
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:24,960
Scott: it takes a while though.

372
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,266
Scott: Okay, so spot it's are $12.

373
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,210
Scott: So we have to.

374
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:29,300
Rym: we at least have to get one to give to Robert coup.

375
00:19:29,562 --> 00:19:33,268
Scott: Yeah, cuz he you know, he doesn't have one already Yeah, but he might have one already.

376
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:34,053
Scott: banana grams.

377
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:40,747
Rym: to our popular consciousness We need to return the favor with spot it unless of course knowing him He probably already has like a sack of spot.

378
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:42,694
Rym: It's probably if he doesn't.

379
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:44,300
Rym: well, you could beat someone with a sack of spot.

380
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,406
Scott: It's yeah, pretty effectively.

381
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:49,636
Scott: He'd be better with oranges that are frozen or doorknobs.

382
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:49,836
Scott: Yeah.

383
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:55,012
Rym: Yeah But we may be doing a little more or not.

384
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:56,176
Rym: That's all up in the air.

385
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:01,210
Rym: We're finalizing details and We'll tell you more about our packs plans as we get closer to packs.

386
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:02,916
Scott: Do we have anything else?

387
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:04,160
Rym: New York Comic Con?

388
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,739
Rym: I'm not announcing anything yet on that because I can't confirm anything yet.

389
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,544
Rym: PAX East.

390
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:12,877
Rym: we'll be doing some stuff in about six and a half months.

391
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:15,625
Rym: Yeah It's April.

392
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:16,229
Rym: It's not that far.

393
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,980
Scott: We have a worst webcomic contest.

394
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:18,846
Scott: It's ongoing.

395
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:25,980
Scott: if you want to submit a worst webcomic You have to go to our website or the forum find the link that goes to the form to fill out.

396
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,960
Scott: It's a Google Docs form to fill out a submission.

397
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:33,420
Scott: We're probably gonna do this episode in two weeks for now because we need another Wednesday idea.

398
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,042
Scott: now That'll be it.

399
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,552
Scott: So two weeks you have a deadline of.

400
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,380
Scott: you know, I need time to read the comics.

401
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:45,582
Scott: So you got maybe a week or so left to submit a worst webcomic and we're gonna start checking them out to figure out Which one's the worst?

402
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:48,551
Rym: Yep, two observations on this one stop submitting control.

403
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:50,096
Scott: You say that every time cuz it's funny.

404
00:20:50,116 --> 00:21:03,360
Rym:  I I Realized that many of you seem to have a surprising amount of furry Pornography at your fingertips and as soon as we said we have a contest.

405
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:07,152
Rym: How many furry porn webcomics can there be?

406
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:07,593
Scott: it's like.

407
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:15,936
Scott: I know that furry porn webcomics exists And I know there are many of them and I know some of them also combine lots of different You know sexual fetishes of sorts.

408
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:21,028
Scott: really dude I couldn't name a single one But the fact that people could you know did.

409
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:26,287
Scott: if you Google sir if I had there was a contest I wanted to win I Could Google search for and find some.

410
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:27,171
Rym: I could also.

411
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:29,600
Scott: I don't know any but it's like people submitting them.

412
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,826
Scott: It seemed like they know them.

413
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:31,751
Scott: It's like a good name.

414
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:32,455
Rym: How do you even?

415
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:33,239
Scott: how do you know these?

416
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:43,229
Rym: I could name comics that were technically furry but weren't porn like Sabrina was fairly famous among the fan crowds or Erotic in partial nature, but not porn.

417
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:43,811
Rym: Yeah, of course.

418
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:51,914
Rym: There's a glove but that's actually right, but It's not just furry porn it's scary gratuitous poorly drawn furry porn.

419
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:53,880
Rym: and fuck you all for making me read this.

420
00:21:54,302 --> 00:21:55,510
Scott: You don't have to read a lot of it.

421
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,617
Scott: We just read enough to figure out.

422
00:21:56,637 --> 00:21:57,040
Scott: What's the world?

423
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:06,744
Rym: I believe the rule we post is that we have to read if available the first ten the last ten and Beyond that We're.

424
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:10,222
Scott: so more it's gonna be a completely subjective Judgment.

425
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:19,595
Scott: where it is we examine the website the art the writing that the if it's still going the craziness Factor we want to take into account and do account and it's up to us.

426
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,465
Rym: the craziness of the author Definitely comes into play.

427
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,372
Scott: anything you want can come into play.

428
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:28,548
Scott: and remember if you submit an entry to this I know let's do it since there's only two of us.

429
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:33,907
Scott: Let's do like a you know, an ebert thumbs up thumbs downs System, what does thumbs up mean?

430
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:36,837
Scott: that it's the worst the worst.

431
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:39,646
Scott: Yeah It's not exactly so.

432
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,331
Rym: thumbs down means is a good comic.

433
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:44,520
Scott: Yeah as in it's not the worst because it's the worst webcomic contest.

434
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,058
Rym: All right Might not have enough thumbs.

435
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:49,738
Scott: Use your toes big toes.

436
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,311
Rym: So Scott what to animate you looking forward to right now.

437
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,619
Rym: Like what are you watching every week when it comes out?

438
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,928
Scott: That number is I don't know.

439
00:22:57,948 --> 00:23:00,664
Scott: I'm watching it every week as soon as it comes up But I did watch three episodes.

440
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:01,768
Scott: that number six show.

441
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:04,860
Rym: I watched one episode and I really like it.

442
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:13,259
Rym: It's the first show I've watched in a long time where I watched an episode and at no point during the episode Do I think when's this over?

443
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:14,846
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

444
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:18,040
Rym: when it's done I think is there another episode?

445
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:28,739
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I wasn't desperate to watch the next episode like I am with some shows, you know It's not like I'm dying to go home and see the next episode like, you know in ponies that this new pony episode I'm running home.

446
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:36,874
Rym: I'm for her like when I first watch eska flown air cowboy bebop like I'd finish that VHS tape and I'd sit there stewing on the fact that I had a goddamn month to wait.

447
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:38,702
Scott: and there are some shows like say Hokuto.

448
00:23:38,722 --> 00:23:39,545
Scott: no can we're like.

449
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:48,360
Scott: I won't rush home be like I gotta watch the mocha dono can but when I was watching it before I finished it all you watch one and you just keep watching the next one the next one the next and you can't stop.

450
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,580
Rym: Yeah until eventually you stop those shows going waves like after a story arc ends.

451
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,812
Rym: It's like the spell breaks and I have like a three episode gap.

452
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,140
Scott: or I could stop watching or there's a recap episode.

453
00:23:58,261 --> 00:24:03,623
Rym: Yep, but as soon as I get past that I'm done all night Yep.

454
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:04,125
Rym: Oh my god.

455
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:05,571
Rym: We'll do a fist of the North Star show soon.

456
00:24:05,591 --> 00:24:06,414
Rym: I'm almost done with it.

457
00:24:06,515 --> 00:24:07,137
Scott: You're really wet.

458
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:07,760
Scott: episode anyone.

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,808
Rym: Ah Fuck I forgot the number again.

Scott: is it still?

462
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:13,959
Scott: is it still fist North Star one?

463
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:14,240
Scott: or you know?

464
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,019
Scott: It fits the North Star - I'm two different openings Oh, so you finish with the North Star one.

465
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:27,824
Scott: I'll just son like it actually says this the North Star - you know - at the at the beginning it's on and he's going to the island of Bob but not Ashra, yeah.

466
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:28,066
Rym: Yeah.

467
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:28,871
Scott: Oh shit.

468
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:32,128
Scott: You're already that where everybody is Surprisingly badass.

469
00:24:32,229 --> 00:24:38,359
Scott: Yes, the island of bad Badass island where the real badasses were hiding this whole time.

470
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:44,638
Rym: Yeah, you look back at like King Sama like whatever dude King Sama your heart.

471
00:24:49,220 --> 00:25:00,396
Rym: But it says to me that Every time I think about what there's a few exceptions like number six and even to the east started this way But then it kind of like I got less invested as it went on as it got less good.

472
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:07,564
Rym: Yeah, but All I want out of anime right now is Either a Satoshi koan movie.

473
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:12,578
Rym: Oh wait or coming kind of ghost in the shell stand-alone complex 3.

474
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:15,170
Scott: somebody Sent a link to something today.

475
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,602
Scott: I don't know much about it, but it's called H Plus.

476
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:20,920
Scott: it's live-action and basically is it goes in the shell ripoff.

477
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:22,243
Scott: That's all.

478
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:22,866
Scott: that's all I know.

479
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:24,454
Scott: I don't know anything else.

480
00:25:24,594 --> 00:25:27,017
Scott: I think that I could look it up But I guess what is it?

481
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,749
Rym: Specifically about the anime that draws in like this like.

482
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,937
Rym: why do we like number six over the million other shows?

483
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:38,535
Rym: because we've watched A lot of similar ish shows where we watch the first episode.

484
00:25:38,555 --> 00:25:39,278
Rym: We're like what the fuck was that?

485
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:39,660
Rym: who cares?

486
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,388
Rym: We never even felt like we forget the name of it.

487
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:41,971
Scott: Mmm.

488
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:43,780
Rym: Why do I remember the name of the show?

489
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,366
Rym: Like what?

490
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:45,179
Rym: what's different?

491
00:25:48,124 --> 00:26:01,340
Rym: I mean it starts out pretty generic like, you know, it's kind of like starts out like geo say like, okay You've got some characters kids school some sort of utopia science fiction, but oh wait, maybe it's a dystopia.

492
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:03,168
Scott: Well, it always is right.

493
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:11,380
Scott: It's that I've noticed there's certain things that are Stereotypical, you know reused cliche plots and anime over and over again, right?

494
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:11,902
Scott: There's the.

495
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:21,700
Scott: you know, you're inside the pretty and beautiful Perfect utopian city and then there's a. it has some sort of walls around it and if you leave it's Blair, right?

496
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:27,539
Scott: You see that sort of an apple seed definitely an ergo proxy definitely in Raza fon definitely in number six.

497
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:37,980
Scott: What other you know sort of even jellying doesn't have it straight up But it's like even jelly is definitely this city and the rest of the world are sort of you know, not the same, right?

498
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,469
Scott: But there's just so many animes where it's like there.

499
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:43,738
Scott: it's like the whole city is a Truman show almost.

500
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:54,451
Scott: Yep That's just you know, this is one example, but there's so many, you know It's the situation but yet I'm drawn in.

501
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:57,684
Rym: I actually kind of want to know what the deal is But we want there's also.

502
00:26:57,765 --> 00:26:59,170
Scott: there's also the secret tower.

503
00:26:59,310 --> 00:26:59,872
Scott: cliche.

504
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:03,123
Scott: number six also has what I'm getting at Promised.

505
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:03,646
Scott: has that?

506
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:05,980
Rym: was it darker than black or was that there was one show?

507
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:11,988
Rym: I remember we watched an episode of that started out kind of cool like this and Then it shows you like a straight-up.

508
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,537
Rym: Just here is the wall around the city.

509
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:15,200
Rym: What's the deal?

510
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,760
Rym: We're not gonna tell you and by the end of the episode I didn't give a shit Like I didn't care what was on the other side of that wall.

511
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:23,454
Scott: I always want to see someone.

512
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:28,580
Scott: just you know If you're gonna do cliches like this at least take them and turn them on their head.

513
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,516
Rym: So what if the story of ergo proxy is really yeah, it sucks outside.

514
00:27:32,556 --> 00:27:33,540
Rym: The inside is a paradise.

515
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,726
Rym: The main character is just crazy.

516
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:36,093
Scott: That's not a bad one.

517
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:37,340
Rym: I would like to see a show like that.

518
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:42,048
Scott: I was thinking more like you're outside the city, right and The Oh big.

519
00:27:42,088 --> 00:27:43,220
Scott: Oh, it was another one with city walls.

520
00:27:44,302 --> 00:27:46,720
Rym: Well, well, well, well, it can't spoil right?

521
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:48,259
Scott: That's not a secret.

522
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:55,897
Scott: But you know you start outside the walls to begin with and you see that there's a city that's walled in and you have no Fucking clue what's in there?

523
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:57,196
Scott: until later.

524
00:27:58,401 --> 00:27:59,445
Rym: Well, you get that a little bit.

525
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:04,060
Rym: remember in last exile when you finally get inside the the real people's stuff and you see what?

526
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,460
Rym: Their lives are like with their first water and their caviar.

527
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:08,703
Scott: Yeah, kind of.

528
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:09,425
Scott: but it's it's not.

529
00:28:09,485 --> 00:28:10,849
Scott: it's not an it's specifically.

530
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:15,320
Scott: the enclosed city physical structure is always you know or the secret tower.

531
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:24,032
Scott: That's up to something a ziggurat of some kind like a metropolis or place promised, you know Yeah You know the same things over and over again in so many different shows and those always.

532
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:35,108
Scott: it seems like there are certain cliches that are That are usually in good shows now, but not always and certain ones that are usually in bad shows But not always I mean part of it is like.

533
00:28:35,128 --> 00:28:39,525
Rym: I look at the moment when the show you have that moment of oh shit That's what this show is about.

534
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:50,663
Rym: like in bacchanal the first episode when you're like, alright gangsters Alright I can dig this and then motherfucker gets stabbed and you realize what the show is really about and you're like, ah That's another thing.

535
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:55,744
Scott: a lot of shows that turn out to be good do is the very beginning of the first episode is some Dark action scene.

536
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:59,599
Scott: maybe someone gets killed or someone's running and they get shot or something like that.

537
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:10,537
Scott: And then it goes la la opener and then la la la introducing characters And then it's not until maybe even the second or third episode They tie it back to that when they cried it.

538
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:14,110
Scott: third 32nd thing that happened at the beginning of the first episode.

539
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:25,250
Rym: remember when they cry opening scene the violent Murder with a baseball bat of someone and then moe happy opener and then moe happy school Like there was no link back to baseball bat murder.

540
00:29:25,572 --> 00:29:30,437
Rym: Yep until later until later You can make a show where you never link back.

541
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:36,620
Scott: Well, did you have a thing that happens in before the opener that doesn't have anything to do with the real show at all?

542
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:44,066
Scott: I just never go back to that You know, what I would do is I would have Like 30 seconds before every opener.

543
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:53,129
Scott: that would make no sense individually, but could be shuffled and pasted in order to make sense But it's nothing to do with the actual show.

544
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:58,318
Rym: that's what you do in front of a kids show like case closed Because then the kids try to solve the mystery.

545
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:11,180
Rym: Yeah, yeah, so I guess let's put it this way What would make like right now Describe like the anime that you would just like lose your shit over like you would like Leave work early to get home and watch that shit?

546
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:14,420
Scott: Well, there's a lot of things that could fit that bill, right?

547
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,275
Scott: But I think what it would.

548
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:27,980
Scott: you know It really had to be a whole lineup because there's so many different kinds of anime I like I would need like one to fit every possible thing maybe even you know, and then again It's like well if I can have the world why don't I have five of every category of anime?

549
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:31,014
Scott: Why don't I have infinity of every category?

550
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:31,878
Scott: of this way?

551
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:37,681
Rym: then Let's look at the ghost in the shell kind of show cuz we've both talked at least why I guess give me goes to the shell Three.

552
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:39,467
Scott: Yeah, well, you don't need to change it.

553
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:40,691
Rym: movie or TV show.

554
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:45,693
Rym: TV show really not another movie not another four That wouldn't hurt either.

555
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,814
Rym: Yeah There's what I want.

556
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:48,139
Rym: You know what?

557
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,222
Rym: I love you Mamoru.

558
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:54,613
Rym: She if I could change anything about a director other than bringing Satoshi come back from the dead.

559
00:30:54,633 --> 00:31:05,279
Rym: I Was never allowed to make a live-action movie again because you would be forced to make comedy anime with action scenes.

560
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:07,871
Rym: That is all I want from you.

561
00:31:07,911 --> 00:31:09,139
Scott: I think he doesn't want to do anymore.

562
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,588
Scott: I mean, Mamoru.

563
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:12,460
Scott: She make it a new Pat Lebois TV series.

564
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,132
Scott: There you go done comedy with comedy with action scenes.

565
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:16,740
Rym: actually, you know what I would like to see.

566
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:20,360
Rym: I'd like to see oh, she go pick up like her say at surah style shows.

567
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,295
Rym: Well, you already did that do it again do something like that.

568
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:25,042
Rym: Pat Lebois imagine Imagine this.

569
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:28,293
Rym: imagine if oh, she did the next key Taro.

570
00:31:28,313 --> 00:31:30,600
Scott: I mean, I don't know if that's his style.

571
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:31,811
Rym: I think you could pull it off.

572
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:37,340
Scott: Yeah Yeah, the thing is I'd also like to see some team-ups right like if I like you get if you know.

573
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,378
Scott: You know, it's always like what if we get two amazing people together like lazy Matsumoto and Daft Punk?

574
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:53,516
Scott: But it's like, you know do those combos really work, you know that in anime at least in comic books They often work because you get the amazing writer and the amazing artist anime they can.

575
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,822
Rym: but I think it's more subtle It's more.

576
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:57,370
Rym: it's not the matter of what they both bring to the table.

577
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:10,960
Rym: It's more what like bullshit drama limitations did they bring to the table and look it's uh Utena, I mean Ikuhara and Chiyo Saito together made Something awesome that they couldn't have each made on their own.

578
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:20,370
Scott: so we can't just go out there and be like, you know, let's get Miyazaki and You know fucking Matsumoto together to work on the same thing.

579
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:28,780
Scott: It's like well that probably actually wouldn't turn out that well Right, but what you could do is you could say well, why don't we get lazy Matsumoto to do Lupin the third?

580
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,768
Scott: that's not bad because I heard.

581
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:33,603
Scott: but just to make say a Ghibli movie.

582
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:37,320
Scott: so he has Ghibli money and Ghibli animators and right working for Mike.

583
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,365
Rym: I just imagine that.

584
00:32:38,425 --> 00:32:39,670
Scott: remember but he has.

585
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,780
Scott: he just writes and directs whatever he wants.

586
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,650
Rym: I glee ostro the Miyazaki Lupin the best like.

587
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,493
Rym: I love that movie.

588
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,057
Rym: It's one of my favorite movies of all time.

589
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,759
Rym: I Want to see the same take on the Matsumoto verse.

590
00:32:54,654 --> 00:33:00,109
Scott: So Galaxy Express, yeah, we could do that.

591
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:01,193
Rym: I would love to see that.

592
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:01,835
Scott: That'd be awesome.

593
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:11,311
Scott: Oh my god I wonder what happened on the space train if if Miyazaki was right now, but the thing is Miyazaki You know, he hasn't been doing too much lately is most.

594
00:33:11,392 --> 00:33:12,355
Rym: I just want more Lupin too.

595
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,920
Scott: cuz Daryl said he's on it.

596
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,106
Scott: He's on the downswing.

597
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,734
Scott: He's got an upswing with his pon.

598
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:19,692
Scott: Yo, I mean Panya was good But it wasn't it was.

599
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:20,599
Scott: no spirited away.

600
00:33:21,544 --> 00:33:23,151
Rym: We need to get back to some Porco Rosso.

601
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:25,380
Scott: Yeah, I heard of Porco Rosso to rumor.

602
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:27,145
Scott: Yeah, we don't even need to make wishes.

603
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:27,727
Rym: You know what?

604
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:28,529
Rym: I heard true.

605
00:33:28,689 --> 00:33:35,299
Rym: I did hear from a semi legitimate source a standalone complex like for real three rumor.

606
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:40,191
Rym: But it was while it was from a pretty legitimate source that I would trust.

607
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,540
Rym: I'm so cynical of those kinds of rumors.

608
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,975
Scott: Yeah, I don't believe anything till I see it.

609
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,747
Rym: I mean Oh My god, I want that so much.

610
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,314
Scott: I know right I pay monies.

611
00:33:52,917 --> 00:34:01,130
Rym: Yeah but I Heard from Daryl's this man in my world order cuz remember we used to watch like the Lupin Specials like after all the movies.

612
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,140
Scott: Yeah, but they tended to be just go downhill.

613
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,373
Rym: So apparently since we stopped watching him, you know what happened?

614
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:06,875
Scott: They suck.

615
00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:08,040
Rym: They got even worse.

616
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:08,943
Scott: How could they get worse?

617
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:13,040
Rym: like everyone was worse than the last one and apparently the one that I was kind of excited about.

618
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,500
Rym: that I just kind of ignored.

619
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:19,280
Rym: I was waiting to hear a review where it was basically red versus green like different eras of Lupin.

620
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,226
Scott: Yeah, what about the detective Conan one?

621
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:21,647
Rym: Apparently?

622
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:24,275
Rym: No, apparently the red versus green one sucked balls.

623
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:24,878
Scott: What?

624
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:35,338
Rym: Yeah Like it was good concept poorly executed And apparently Lupin is not even like that big in the case closed one.

625
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,871
Scott: so eh What would happen if this summer Wars guy did Lupin me?

626
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:39,835
Rym: Oh my god.

627
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:40,780
Scott: What do you think you do?

628
00:34:41,944 --> 00:34:43,550
Rym: That would be no he would you know why?

629
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:51,800
Rym: cuz look at the kinds of characters that like The Lupin family as a giant group just to look at what was great about summer wars.

630
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:53,737
Rym: He could pull off that same kind of stuff.

631
00:34:55,844 --> 00:35:04,558
Scott: Or if he got the Durara guy to do a movie Instead of doing a show cuz then he'd be forced to like bring it all in with a lot of money obviously.

632
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:06,766
Rym: Yeah Yeah, what would he do that?

633
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:07,709
Rym: What what story?

634
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:08,953
Rym: an original story maybe?

635
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,700
Scott: Yeah, it's something on its own.

636
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,708
Scott: Yeah, I don't want to Durara movie.

637
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:13,953
Rym: No, no, but I'm saying even.

638
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:15,520
Rym: but what about him doing his movie?

639
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,007
Rym: That's also a take on an existing thing.

640
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:20,676
Scott: No, it should just be it's his own movie.

641
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:22,522
Scott: Just something original I want to see.

642
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:26,316
Scott: you know, there's too many, you know as much as I want more Lupin's that don't suck.

643
00:35:26,817 --> 00:35:32,576
Scott: or you know Another space train something, you know, even though nothing will ever be as good as it was right?

644
00:35:33,118 --> 00:35:38,797
Scott: It's much better Just have more new original things, you know, Hollywood can give me all the sequels in the universe.

645
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:39,620
Scott: I don't need more.

646
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,567
Scott: I need more original something.

647
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:41,929
Scott: that doesn't.

648
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:43,374
Scott: I mean I'll ask ghost in the shell.

649
00:35:43,394 --> 00:35:44,879
Scott: I'll take more but other things.

650
00:35:45,623 --> 00:35:53,894
Scott: I want something new and original I would take your wood on because look at James Bond I mean like you wouldn't want Otomo to make a Kira - you'd want Otomo to make something fresh.

651
00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:59,149
Scott: That's not freedom and cup noodle That all he did was design little.

652
00:35:59,189 --> 00:35:59,912
Rym: what about manga?

653
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:01,500
Rym: because there's the easy answer here.

654
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:01,902
Rym: But what?

655
00:36:02,424 --> 00:36:06,040
Scott: well, I mean, you know, obviously you want to bring Tezuka and such back from the dead.

656
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:09,551
Scott: Like you could do animes too if you came back from the dead.

657
00:36:09,611 --> 00:36:13,709
Rym: the thing is I don't even need to say Oh, why don't they make a manga about this?

658
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:14,412
Rym: They're all done.

659
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,256
Rym: They're all in Japan.

660
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,020
Rym: None of them are in English.

661
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:17,909
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much mostly.

662
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:18,573
Scott: Hey make more.

663
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:20,060
Scott: say things like sanctuary.

664
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,760
Scott: Yeah, I'd like to see a sanctuary though that took place in the US but had that same attitude, right?

665
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:37,298
Rym: So like it, you know like Frank Miller's sanctuary, you know you need you need Frank Miller to adapt sanctuary Heavily like heavily adapted don't stay too true to it to the real U.S.

666
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:45,906
Scott: Make it an HBO like one season to show or dirty 80s U.S This is all he likes.

667
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:51,266
Rym: dirty 80s punk shit, yeah You ever see Strange Days?

668
00:36:51,848 --> 00:36:52,410
Scott: Never heard of it.

669
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:52,751
Rym: Really?

670
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:53,835
Rym: You should watch Strange Days.

671
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:54,578
Rym: It's in Netflix.

672
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:55,180
Rym: Is it strange?

673
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,930
Rym: It's you know the 80s like that 80s punk dystopia.

674
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:02,000
Rym: Yeah Strange Days is the 90s dystopia.

675
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,796
Rym: I've seen very few representations of the 90s dystopia.

676
00:37:05,836 --> 00:37:06,640
Scott: The 90s are pretty good.

677
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,940
Rym: That's why yeah, exactly Strange Days is take the problems of the 90s and extend them into the future.

678
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:17,054
Rym: It's actually really good and the ending is the same ending as the difference engine.

679
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,622
Scott: So wouldn't that be like Back to the Future 2?

680
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:26,530
Rym: You know kind of similar except more race stuff Because you know Rodney King all that stuff.

681
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,934
Rym: It's kind of like that extension.

682
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:32,001
Rym: Ah, but yeah actually Back to the Future 2.

683
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:37,240
Rym: Similar in some ways but Strange Days has a little bit of a Ghost in the Shell element.

684
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:39,564
Rym: You'll like the movie.

685
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:40,247
Rym: It's up your alley.

686
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:45,400
Scott: Maybe I Don't know but yeah, I got a manga that doesn't exist, right?

687
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,084
Scott: You know, it's like.

688
00:37:46,104 --> 00:37:48,501
Scott: well most of the manga is just like on go, you know It's.

689
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:50,068
Rym: it's so the ones that I want to read.

690
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,380
Rym: I just need someone to translate them and release them here.

691
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:55,795
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's like I want more Phoenix.

692
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:56,760
Scott: That's not good, right?

693
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,070
Scott: I Don't know what kind of manga doesn't exist that I actually.

694
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:05,903
Rym: I think it all seems to exist as much as I want sanctuary to Be like.

695
00:38:06,345 --> 00:38:07,270
Scott: I guess you know.

696
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:08,074
Scott: go back to anime.

697
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:09,260
Scott: I'll take a yotsuba anime.

698
00:38:09,864 --> 00:38:11,819
Scott: I could watch that it's never gonna exist, but I want it.

699
00:38:12,302 --> 00:38:14,089
Rym: I almost don't want it to be like.

700
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,737
Rym: I'd like it to be full episodes.

701
00:38:15,777 --> 00:38:21,186
Rym: Like I was among Adil I would also like it to be shorts Like just little shorts.

702
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:24,420
Scott: I also don't want it to just be a direct adaptation of the manga.

703
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,156
Scott: I wanted to just be like make more yotsuba episodes that aren't in the manga.

704
00:38:28,196 --> 00:38:28,678
Scott: So it's like.

705
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:30,500
Rym: Yeah, you had to see both.

706
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:33,928
Rym: You get you get Osmo to write it right?

707
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:38,117
Rym: Yeah, but with assistance from and direction from oshi.

708
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:39,461
Scott: I Don't know.

709
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:40,786
Scott: you do yotsuba very well.

710
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:41,810
Scott: He's good at comedy.

711
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,412
Scott: Just hates it.

712
00:38:42,633 --> 00:38:44,440
Scott: No, no, I think there are other people who do better.

713
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:46,251
Scott: Yeah, I mean you just get the people did.

714
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,297
Scott: I was among a dad to do it.

715
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:49,992
Rym: Oh, yeah I don't even know who was on that project.

716
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:50,535
Rym: I don't know hand.

717
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:51,380
Rym: I have to look it up.

718
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:56,151
Scott: You know, there's also I kinda you know I do kind of like, you know the kind of.

719
00:38:56,231 --> 00:39:00,967
Scott: there is some stuff they don't make anymore like Really stupid crazy racist stuff.

720
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,090
Scott: Like what was that?

721
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,678
Scott: That's that show with the school of full of bad kids.

722
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:11,470
Scott: Oh the one I Forget it was like even with the predecessor of chromardier.

723
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,758
Scott: Yeah, it's like yeah Oh to kojuku.

724
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:14,340
Rym: That was it.

725
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,947
Rym: Yeah, it's a show is pretty great.

726
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:17,213
Scott: I want stuff like that.

727
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:22,174
Scott: That doesn't exist anymore You know, they totally badass off-the-wall fucked up shit.

728
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:23,780
Scott: Well, there's probably shouldn't exist.

729
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:36,980
Rym: Before where there's the like there was the old style of zany anime comedy like Ron Mar or something Yeah, and then we moved into a newer style of zany comedy the Excel saga style.

730
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,638
Rym: Mmm, I heard someone made a pretty good edit of Excel saga.

731
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:43,460
Scott: Yeah, which Excel saga I think is just Pedro.

732
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:48,140
Scott: It's what leads into like, you know YouTube poop and those sorts of things that we have nowadays.

733
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:49,799
Rym: Anime world order said it best.

734
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:51,172
Rym: Was it them?

735
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:51,940
Rym: someone said this?

736
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,682
Rym: I don't remember who.

737
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:57,920
Rym: that Excel saga is the best anime in the world for anime fans.

738
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,939
Rym: So we're in this very narrow time window.

739
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:17,451
Rym: You have to have just seen enough anime to kind of get the jokes or at least get that they're referring to other anime You may not have seen and yet haven't seen enough anime to realize that the show is actually just random Family Guy bullshit Mmm like in that golden up like that golden window.

740
00:40:17,471 --> 00:40:19,879
Rym: That is one of the funniest shows you will ever see.

741
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:22,695
Scott: Pretty funny when we were in that golden window.

742
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:30,548
Rym: Yeah But I think back at what I laughed at and it's not that funny to me now But I can see why I laughed at it back then.

743
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:31,411
Rym: Mmm.

744
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:33,660
Scott: I never did finish it me either.

745
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:39,140
Scott: Wasn't there something with like a the last episode porn basically or something?

746
00:40:40,142 --> 00:40:46,830
Rym: It's porn in the same way that the second Wander not wanders, but El Hazzard OAV was kind of horny and stupid.

747
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,759
Rym: Mm-hmm, except I heard this was more porny.

748
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:51,393
Rym: I don't know if it was more stupid.

749
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:52,039
Scott: I have no idea.

750
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:53,442
Rym: You know what?

751
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:58,180
Rym: I could actually go for another like El Hazzard style fantasy comedy.

752
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,195
Scott: Yeah, nobody, you know all the fantasy shows these days are just so.

753
00:41:02,657 --> 00:41:05,569
Rym: slayers is good But slayers isn't really the same genre.

754
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:23,772
Rym: slayers is almost a fighting show Yeah, but like El Hazzard not the best show in the world but the kind of show that's a serious fantasy esque plot in an interesting original world and yet is just kind of Constant low-level comedy throughout the otherwise serious plot.

755
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:26,019
Scott: or you know, just even just go for the.

756
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:29,454
Scott: you know Something just in the old style right where you know, look at Genji.

757
00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:34,010
Scott: Ken for example is like, you know Has the school plus the something right Haru?

758
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,940
Scott: He has the school plus the sci-fi weirdness, whatever.

759
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,399
Scott: I haven't even seen it, but I know that's what it has.

760
00:41:39,224 --> 00:41:52,953
Scott: And in the same way Mahoutsukai tie has the school plus the Right, so give me the show that you know, too many of the shows nowadays are like, you know school plus something Crappy, you know.

761
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:55,688
Rym: So give me something good.

762
00:41:55,708 --> 00:42:03,318
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you're gonna bring in, you know The school part combine it with the awesome sci-fi part going back.

763
00:42:03,338 --> 00:42:07,211
Scott: and well Remember even Evangelion is school plus sci-fi.

764
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:10,160
Rym: remember full metal panic, right?

765
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:17,215
Rym: But that originally was school funny Which is pretty funny even though kind of cliche and semi serious average robot action.

766
00:42:17,295 --> 00:42:20,908
Rym: and what part of that was popular The school bullshit and they made fumafu.

767
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,554
Scott: Yeah, which is just the school part.

768
00:42:22,615 --> 00:42:23,438
Rym: It was terrible.

769
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:32,680
Scott: Yeah Well, I think the thing was is that you know The the school part was so bleh and the military part because I did watch the entire first series back in the day.

770
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:34,707
Scott: That the military part.

771
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:35,952
Scott: I didn't read the comic though.

772
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:39,162
Scott: The military part was just so Average.

773
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:41,088
Scott: there was just nothing great about it.

774
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,550
Scott: Nothing bad.

775
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:48,435
Scott: It was it was like a. it was like a boring generic Plot of a video game where you piloted a mech or something like that.

776
00:42:48,475 --> 00:42:49,439
Scott: It was literally like this.

777
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,449
Rym: bad Whoo now contrast it with remember Gasaraki.

778
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:57,082
Rym: Yeah, right same deal in that it's a boring slow Military.

779
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:59,972
Rym: but yet Gasaraki pulled me the fuck in.

780
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:02,180
Scott: I know we're the only people who like that show.

781
00:43:02,381 --> 00:43:05,016
Rym: We got to watch that again and review it, but I think that's a good show.

782
00:43:05,036 --> 00:43:05,700
Scott: We done a show.

783
00:43:05,941 --> 00:43:06,724
Rym: No, we haven't.

784
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:07,688
Rym: Holy fuck.

785
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:08,572
Rym: We gotta go.

786
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:09,014
Rym: I'll get it.

787
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:09,516
Rym: I'll get it.

788
00:43:09,556 --> 00:43:09,978
Rym: We'll watch it.

789
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:12,288
Scott: We have a the V dubbed VHS tape.

790
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:14,860
Scott: then we got rid of those and not like we have a VHS player.

791
00:43:14,981 --> 00:43:16,487
Rym: Anyway, I still do actually.

792
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:17,692
Scott: Oh, does it work?

793
00:43:17,933 --> 00:43:18,174
Rym: Yes.

794
00:43:18,214 --> 00:43:19,058
Rym: I'm getting rid of it though.

795
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:25,460
Rym: Okay Hey anyone out there you want what was once a four thousand dollar top of the line VHS camcorder.

796
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:27,007
Scott: Oh the camcorder.

797
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:28,012
Rym: It's also a VCR.

798
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:28,554
Scott: All right.

799
00:43:28,755 --> 00:43:28,976
Scott: Yeah.

800
00:43:29,177 --> 00:43:33,266
Rym: Yeah, but Gasaraki Was I like shows like that too?

801
00:43:33,286 --> 00:43:34,750
Rym: Because it was very focused.

802
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:40,823
Scott: it Gasaraki perfect collection on Amazon 77 66.

803
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:41,606
Rym: I'll get it somewhere.

804
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:42,510
Scott: Let me check elsewhere.

805
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:52,827
Rym: I will get it somehow anyway, but What got me about Gasaraki is that a lot of anime and I think I've kind of pinpointed what it is that I like other than ghosts in the shell.

806
00:43:53,712 --> 00:44:04,769
Rym: if you if I start watching a show and There's a moment like when you read a book you watch a movie or your brain like you suddenly see I know where this is Going there's gonna be drama about X. I don't give a shit.

807
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:18,460
Rym: Yeah, anytime I predict that like I feel like Now they're gonna have a misunderstanding About this and that's gonna be the driving plot point when I expect that and it doesn't happen Like the show totally goes a different direction.

808
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:20,351
Rym: That almost guarantees.

809
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:20,674
Rym: It's a show.

810
00:44:20,694 --> 00:44:21,198
Rym: I'm gonna like.

811
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,948
Rym: Gasaraki was Surprisingly not stereotypical.

812
00:44:25,968 --> 00:44:27,112
Scott: Yeah, I've never.

813
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:29,802
Scott: I'm sure there are other shows like that But I haven't.

814
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:40,098
Rym: parts of some Gundams are like that parts Pocket and less like more original Gundam.

815
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,584
Scott: see On Gundam seeds.

816
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:45,314
Scott: that shall not be named right, you know, give me the show.

817
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:46,217
Scott: Give me the Gundam show.

Scott: Keep you know has the good characters some comedy you had.

820
00:44:52,438 --> 00:44:53,040

00:44:53,502 --> 00:44:53,923
Scott: I know the.

822
00:44:54,044 --> 00:44:58,340
Scott: give me another Gundam seed just like Gundam seed but not Gundam seed.

823
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,840
Scott: I know that's like they tried that with destiny and I know I'm asking for another sequel.

824
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:05,759
Scott: But it's like actually, you know what don't give me a Gundam, right?

825
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:18,414
Scott: Give me some other show doesn't need to be a robot show But just make it that 50 episode show with the characters and the you know Political evolving plotline with like four or five arcs.

826
00:45:18,474 --> 00:45:20,080
Scott: that just keeps you hooked the whole time.

827
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,667
Scott: It doesn't have to even have to be robots.

828
