1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,109
Rym: It's Tuesday, March 22nd, 2011.

2
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:10,290
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:12,919
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,740
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:22,922
Rym: Tonight, spot it and highlights from PAX East 2011.

6
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:23,939
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:28,539
Rym: And we're back.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,344
Scott: Yep.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,080
Rym: God, two weekends in a row of conventions is almost too much for this pony.

10
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:35,767
Scott: That is definitely too much.

11
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:38,200
Scott: It wasn't just the conventions, right?

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,260
Scott: It was like almost every night I was out doing something after work.

13
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:44,859
Scott: I have not been home immediately after work since pre-Pax.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,537
Rym: Since pre-Pax?

15
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:47,300
Rym: Yep.

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,900
Rym: Damn, I actually have been home almost every day because I planned well.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,698
Scott: I had all this stuff to do.

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,959
Rym: Yeah, I did all my stuff.

19
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:57,420
Scott: I had so much stuff to do, I couldn't do it all.

20
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,940
Scott: I opted to do the things that were out on the town and neglected laundry and groceries.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,560
Rym: Ah, see, I've gotten around things on the town by never needing things on the town.

22
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,773
Rym: I mean, I needed new boots.

23
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:12,000
Rym: Got it at Ross.

24
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,225
Scott: I'm not talking about shopping.

25
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:16,540
Scott: It's like going to meetings with people and events of various sorts.

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,559
Rym: I got that hacker thing next week that I forgot about until I got a reminder about it.

27
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:21,780
Scott: Oh, you actually need to go to it?

28
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,780
Rym: Yeah, might as well.

29
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,520
Scott: The hacker town hall, the one we went to before?

30
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:24,793
Rym: Yep.

31
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,995
Scott: I don't know if I'm going to go back.

32
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:26,280
Scott: The town hall...

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,299
Rym: This one supposedly is more structured and has stuff going on.

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,703
Scott: Really?

35
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:31,180
Scott: Alright, maybe I'll try it one more time.

36
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:32,228
Rym: I may or may not go.

37
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:33,601
Rym: I haven't decided 100%.

38
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:36,539
Scott: Yeah, because the hacker town hall I've been sort of disappointed in.

39
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,800
Scott: Not really the greatest expenditure of time.

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,460
Rym: It's only because they don't have enough structure and they don't actually do anything.

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,400
Rym: It seems to exist solely so that people who are desperate for venture capital can give business cards to other people who they think are venture capitalists.

42
00:01:52,064 --> 00:01:52,619
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,200
Rym: I mean, I got more business cards thrown in my face there than any place I've ever been short of an anime con.

44
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,059
Scott: That's what the tech things are all about.

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,459
Rym: Yeah, it kind of bothers me.

46
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,300
Scott: Apparently there's this thing that's called the New York Tech Meetup, right?

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,240
Scott: And you think that that's the biggest thing.

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,070
Scott: And it is the biggest thing.

49
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,920
Scott: There's a zillion people.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,100
Scott: It fills the Skirball, which you went there to see Will Wright, remember?

51
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:11,674
Scott: Oh, yeah.

52
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:14,020
Scott: And they fill it, I think, every month.

53
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:15,433
Scott: And you have to buy a ticket to it.

54
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:16,059
Scott: It's not free.

55
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:24,699
Scott: And apparently you have to be on... It's one of those things like Otakon Artist Alley where you have to buy the ticket right away before it sells out.

56
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,200
Scott: But supposedly, from what everyone says, I've never been to it, the vast majority of the people there are business people.

57
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Scott: And there's a very small number of actual tech people there.

58
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,280
Scott: So it's like, if you're a tech person, it's just like everyone just wants to give you money and whatever, whatever.

59
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:41,260
Rym: Yeah, sounds about right.

60
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,580
Rym: I wouldn't mind them giving me money, except that usually when I get offers where someone says, "I will give you money to do something," it's not something fun.

61
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,360
Scott: No, but basically if I had a product that I wanted to demonstrate, I would go to it.

62
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,180
Scott: But otherwise, there's no reason for me to go there.

63
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,200
Rym: But anyway, since we're back, we're going to do normal GeekNights shows again.

64
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,640
Rym: This, I think, is the first gaming show since PAX.

65
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,065
Scott: Yeah, sometimes it's weird.

66
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:06,160
Scott: I don't realize it that often, but I think we need to be more conscious of it.

67
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,980
Scott: That because we do a show, any given day is once every other week.

68
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:15,380
Scott: If we miss one Tuesday show, that means a month goes by between Tuesday shows.

69
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:15,778
Rym: Yup.

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,258
Scott: That's too much, I think.

71
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,013
Scott: Yup.

72
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,002
Scott: So...

73
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,099
Rym: Granted, every year convention season kind of hits us in the ass.

74
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:25,566
Scott: Uh, yeah.

75
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:26,249
Scott: Whatever.

76
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,800
Scott: But yeah, we're going back on regular schedule.

77
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,743
Scott: Hurray.

78
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:30,467
Scott: Finally.

79
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,820
Scott: So, let's get to some regular old news.

80
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,218
Scott: Alright.

81
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,533
Scott: So, we were at the PAX.

82
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,979
Rym: We were at the PAX.

83
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:43,639
Scott: And usually, you know, we're the kind of people that like to ignore certain things that other people find really exciting, like waiting in line to play the latest and greatest thing.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Rym: Now, we've talked about this in our PAX shows.

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,800
Rym: I mean, there's nothing in the expo hall that you can't play on your own with no wait within a couple months at most.

86
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:53,402
Scott: Right.

87
00:03:53,422 --> 00:04:02,237
Scott: So, it's like, why would you wait two hours to play Duke Nukem 3D when you could just not go play a board game for two hours, then, in a month, buy Duke Nukem 3D?

88
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,500
Rym: Well, if you needed yet another reason to not wait in line in expo halls.

89
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,280
Scott: Right.

90
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:13,020
Scott: So, we went and I was gonna make an exception to my not waiting in line rule because the 3DS was there.

91
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,213
Scott: And I'm like, "Oh, I gotta check that

92
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:14,456
Scott: out.".

93
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:14,820
Scott: Right?

94
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,959
Scott: That's just too, you know, that's just too big a thing not to check out.

95
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:23,400
Scott: And supposedly, the line looked really long, but people said the line only took 20 minutes, but whatever.

96
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,619
Rym: 20 PEX minutes, though, to be fair.

97
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,715
Scott: Yeah, those are valuable minutes.

98
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:27,080
Scott: Anyway.

99
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,059
Rym: I have only a few of them twice a year.

100
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:37,908
Scott: The thing is, as soon as we got back to New York City, the Nintendo store around the corner from my office had 3DSs, and you could just walk up and use one.

101
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:39,940
Scott: And also, there's a huge display in Grand Central.

102
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,420
Scott: You can just walk up and use the 3DS not waiting.

103
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:42,601
Rym: Huh.

104
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:44,820
Rym: Literally across the street from my office.

105
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:49,699
Scott: So, I just went over and I tried one out for a significant, like, you know, 20 minutes.

106
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,574
Rym: What was extra funny is I went at, like, peak lunch hour.

107
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:53,580
Rym: You know, like, millions of people everywhere.

108
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,218
Scott: I wonder how many minutes they gave you at PEX.

109
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,964
Scott: And here's the thing.

110
00:04:57,485 --> 00:05:09,186
Rym: Not only was I the only dude anywhere near the Nintendo display, I was the only guy, like, who even was interested, and the Nintendo employees were trying to get anyone to come over, and it seems like no one cared.

111
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,580
Rym: The fact that I walked over, they were, like, elated.

112
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:13,970
Rym: They were like, "Oh my god, they surrounded

113
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,070
Rym: me.".

114
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,995
Rym: They're like, "I'll play with you.

115
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:15,739
Rym: You want me to show you how it

116
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:15,920
Rym: works?".

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,836
Rym: "Oh my god, D-S-I, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

118
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:17,977
Rym: yeah.".

119
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,320
Scott: How much did they get paid to be that excited?

120
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:21,719
Rym: They, it was...

121
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,116
Scott: You gotta pay me a lot to, I mean, like, if you don't pay them a lot, they're just gonna stand there like, "Yup,

122
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:26,999
Scott: yup.".

123
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,568
Rym: So, you know why I think they were excited?

124
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,720
Rym: Boredom trumps all.

125
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,189
Rym: There was nobody there.

126
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,660
Rym: Nobody cares in the real world about video games.

127
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:44,650
Scott: Yeah, I'm, it's like I wanna bet against the 3DS, 'cause the signs are pointing south, but I can't possibly bet against the Nintendo handheld.

128
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,460
Scott: You just, that is the dumbest bet you can possibly make.

129
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,592
Rym: I'm gonna bet against, but not in the way you'd expect.

130
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:51,060
Rym: Here's my problem.

131
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,819
Rym: Go back to when the DS came out, when Nintendo was like, "Look, we have our Game Boy, it's number

132
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:58,019
Rym: one.".

133
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,316
Rym: "We have the Wii, you know, GameCube/Wii, that's number

134
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:01,457
Rym: two.".

135
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,427
Rym: The third pillar is gonna be the DS.

136
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:08,819
Rym: Now that was code speak for, "The DS is probably gonna fail, and we're hedging our

137
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,120
Rym: bets.".

138
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:09,882
Scott: That's right.

139
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:15,680
Scott: We can go, we can fall back on the GBA and just make, come out with a better GBA if the DS doesn't work.

140
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,460
Rym: And of course, we thought, Virtual Boy at worst, and both bought DSes the day it came out.

141
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Scott: That was a good strategy.

142
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,179
Rym: Ah, it was a good strategy, except that there were no good games for the DS for some time after it came out.

143
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,420
Scott: Oh, there was Mario 64.

144
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,300
Rym: Which I'd already played.

145
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,639
Scott: Yeah, there were a few.

146
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,459
Rym: Name another one, name a game.

147
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:34,259
Scott: Advance Wars.

148
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,800
Rym: I had that, uh, when did the first DS Advance Wars come out, Scott?

149
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,999
Scott: The day after the DS came out.

150
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,240
Rym: Yeah, and I already had two Advance Warses on the GBA.

151
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:42,900
Scott: That's right.

152
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:50,320
Scott: But the thing is, there was, you know, at launch, there was something exciting, and then there was a big gap before anything else came out.

153
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,780
Scott: And the only thing about the DS, really, is that the third parties have been holding it up.

154
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Scott: Big third parties on the DS, not on the Wii.

155
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:05,020
Rym: You can't blame the third parties anymore, because Nintendo, they never, like, even their own first party products don't innovate at nearly as much as they used to.

156
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,160
Rym: There was that one era where they were like, check it out, Crystal Chronicles, shared spaces, private spaces, four swords.

157
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,980
Scott: Of course, yeah, the era where they were the most innovative was the era when they were on the bottom with the GameCube, right?

158
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,640
Rym: Yup, because innovation is not how you make money.

159
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,840
Scott: 'Cause when they, you see, now they were at the bottom, so they tried to innovate and do lots of cool new stuff to get back on top.

160
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:27,900
Scott: And it worked, they innovated the Wii and the DS, and now they're on top, so they stopped innovating.

161
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,060
Rym: So, I guess my trouble is, I do not trust Nintendo anymore to buy anything they make sight unseen.

162
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:34,835
Scott: Yup.

163
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,728
Rym: There was a time when they would say, "Zelda

164
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:36,949
Rym: game?"

165
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:38,035
Rym: and I would say, "Give me one.

166
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:38,437
Rym: Sold.".

167
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:40,280
Rym: I mean, I'd already spent my money.

168
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,600
Scott: I'll probably buy the Wii Zelda game that's gonna come out.

169
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,540
Rym: Yeah, yeah, probably.

170
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:45,257
Scott: Whatever it is.

171
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,071
Rym: But I wouldn't buy it sight unseen.

172
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,359
Rym: I'm gonna look at a review first.

173
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:50,200
Scott: I'll probably pay 50 bucks for it.

174
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:50,664
Rym: I might.

175
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,440
Rym: I'm gonna wait, though, and see.

176
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,260
Scott: I'll pre-order on Amazon.

177
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:55,780
Rym: I don't pre-order any Nintendo anymore.

178
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,813
Scott: I'll pre-order a big Zelda game on Amazon.

179
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,577
Scott: That's a safe bet.

180
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:08,872
Rym: There's just, I don't trust Nintendo to make games I care about anymore, and while they may eventually, and there's gonna be this long, like, build-up until eventually, "Oh, snap!

181
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:10,418
Rym: The 3DS is the

182
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:10,899
Rym: console!".

183
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,764
Rym: Then, you know what?

184
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,315
Rym: I'll buy the 3DS Lite.

185
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,400
Scott: I. Yeah, I'm definitely, 3DS Lite is definitely something.

186
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,437
Scott: So anyway, I used the 3DS, I played Pilotwings, I played Street Fighter, and, uh...

187
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:25,857
Rym: I think it was like three or four years ago on GeekNights, I kept saying, "They gotta remake

188
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:26,540
Rym: Pilotwings!".

189
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:27,058
Rym: They did.

190
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:39,860
Scott: But yeah, you know, basically what it amounted to is the 3D actually works surprisingly well, and I'm pretty sure that my hypothesis of it's all about how good your vision is.

191
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,920
Scott: People with really good vision have less, far less problems with 3D stuff like this than people with less good vision.

192
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:54,880
Scott: Anyway, I have amazing vision, so the 3D worked just fine, but if you do tilt it, it becomes 2D, you know, if you got a bad viewing angle.

193
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:01,580
Rym: Now, the funny thing is, tilting it, you tilt it like one and a half degrees left or right, and it kinda, like, it messes it up.

194
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:08,840
Scott: Like, the depth just collapses, which is expected, I mean, obviously there's- But at least it doesn't become, like, unviewable, it just becomes flat.

195
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,536
Scott: You know, the 3D goes away, but you can still see what's going on, so you actually won't fuck up your game.

196
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:15,520
Scott: You'll still, like, win.

197
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:20,300
Rym: Also, Scott, I just have to, 'cause I knew you were wrong, but I wanted to have the exact evidence to crush you.

198
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,743
Rym: DS released in North America November 21st, 2004.

199
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:25,877
Rym: Okay.

200
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,760
Rym: Advance Wars DS released in North America August 22nd, 2005.

201
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:30,850
Rym: What?

202
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,619
Rym: Six months, more than six months.

203
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,339
Rym: I remember- You're wrong, you're lying, you're making shit up.

204
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:36,828
Scott: What?

205
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:37,207
Rym: Yeah.

206
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,340
Scott: 'Cause I remember we went to that GameStop in Wildwood, like, the day after.

207
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:45,560
Rym: Uh, Scott, we had DS's for a long time before that.

208
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:46,379
Rym: I don't know.

209
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,059
Rym: I bought my DS in the winter.

210
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:52,140
Scott: Anyway, it must be true if it's on Wikipedia.

211
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:58,540
Rym: So, alright, I could've waited six months, lost nothing, and then bought the DS.

212
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:58,911
Scott: True.

213
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,349
Scott: So, anyway, the 3DS, the 3D was way cool.

214
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:07,340
Scott: There is no denying that the 3D was totally awesome, unless, you know, it doesn't work for you.

215
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,964
Rym: Eh, one problem with the 3D.

216
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:18,962
Rym: It worked perfectly, but if you set it to the maximum 3D, though I do really like how you have a slider to control how 3D it is- The slider didn't really- it only made it, like, a little bit more deeper- Are you kidding?

217
00:10:18,982 --> 00:10:22,560
Rym: When I slid it, it moved in like a foot worth of vision.

218
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,202
Scott: Really?

219
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:25,720
Scott: It only moved- you know, I didn't see that much movement.

220
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:33,020
Rym: When I put it to the max, it was way in there, but at the same time, when I had it at the max, about five minutes of play and my eyes started hurting.

221
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,140
Scott: No, my eyes didn't hurt at all.

222
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,520
Rym: But then when I moved it in a little bit from the max, it looked just as good, and no more eye hurt.

223
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:38,940
Scott: Really?

224
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,703
Scott: I had no eye hurt whatsoever, at any point.

225
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:50,020
Scott: But anyway, the thing was, is like, the Street Fighter game, it was actually- I was like, 'cause Street Fighter, any fighting game that's serious, you're like, no handheld can possibly do that.

226
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,960
Scott: But actually, because it has four face buttons and two LR, it actually kind of worked.

227
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,186
Rym: Oh, you got to play the Street Fighter.

228
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:58,340
Rym: They actually didn't have any DS games to play in Grand Central.

229
00:10:58,523 --> 00:10:58,877
Scott: Oh, really?

230
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,512
Rym: They had this one bullshit game where the camera- so it shows the real world through the camera, and when you move it around, you see the real world.

231
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:07,336
Rym: And there's stuff you got to shoot.

232
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:09,460
Rym: It's like a real space first person shooter.

233
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:10,360
Scott: Oh, that could be cool.

234
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,500
Rym: It was cool, except it was like this stupid demo game that was obviously aimed at old people and little kids.

235
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,859
Scott: Yeah, there's no way you're going to pay for that.

236
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,003
Scott: No.

237
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:18,951
Scott: It's like, oh, this is cool.

238
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,039
Scott: I would never pay for it.

239
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:27,920
Rym: But it's interesting that in the World Store, they had real games, and then in the real world, where they're trying to demo it, they have the same kind of crap that they sell on the Wii.

240
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:31,849
Scott: Oh, yeah, but I also- you know, Pilotwings, you know, was Pilotwings.

241
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:33,292
Scott: It's like, fly through the rings.

242
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:36,920
Scott: And I was flying through the rings, and I flew through all the rings successfully, and then I landed.

243
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,120
Rym: Hey, Pilotwings was a pretty revolutionary game.

244
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,643
Scott: Yeah, but this is just Pilotwings.

245
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:47,380
Scott: It's like, so, it's like there's- the 3DS is cool, the 3D works, but there's no- there's nothing on it that I want to pay for.

246
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,972
Rym: Thus, why I said I'm betting against it for me.

247
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:53,220
Rym: I'm betting against it for the hardcore gamers.

248
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:58,651
Scott: If I get the 3DS Lite, I'm putting it on the same, you know, truck that I put my Pokemon on.

249
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:00,235
Scott: I'm not going to get Pokemon Black and White.

250
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:02,720
Scott: If they come out with Pokemon Gray, then I'll get it.

251
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,740
Scott: Now, think about what this means.

252
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,991
Scott: I'm not going to get- I'm not going to get a 3DS.

253
00:12:06,111 --> 00:12:07,438
Scott: I'm going to wait for 3DS Lite.

254
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:17,740
Rym: Scott, NES, SNES, N64, GameCube, all the Game Boys for decades are, like, when we saw Nintendo, we thought, I'm buying whatever they make.

255
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,079
Scott: Go listen to old GeekNights.

256
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:19,470
Scott: Yeah.

257
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,308
Scott: Nintendo, Nintendo, Nintendo.

258
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:22,235
Scott: PC gaming is dead.

259
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:22,959
Scott: Nintendo, Nintendo.

260
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:28,060
Rym: And I think it's a big sea change for me personally that in the new round of Nintendo, I don't trust them anymore.

261
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,900
Scott: Listen to new GeekNights, Xbox, Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, Xbox.

262
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,059
Rym: Well, what it is is that Nintendo is no longer the "I'll buy it without looking at

263
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,120
Rym: it.".

264
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,122
Rym: Now, I'm not saying it's bad.

265
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:40,670
Rym: I'm saying that it has gone down to the level of everything else in my life.

266
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,554
Rym: I will look at it before I buy it.

267
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:45,400
Rym: I will hand the money after I've seen what they have to offer.

268
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:58,680
Scott: Yeah, I pre-ordered and purchased on release a Game Boy Color, a GBA, regular, and a DS Fat, and I'm not going to do that for a 3DS.

269
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,512
Rym: Yeah, big sea change.

270
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:01,159
Rym: I'm telling you.

271
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:12,340
Rym: So, we played this game at PAX, and it's kind of like brain jungle speed, because as you know, jungle speed kind of made the rounds in the front row crew, and now we've kind of created monsters.

272
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,179
Rym: Scott and I like the game, but I think everyone else in the crew likes it way more than we do.

273
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,060
Scott: But it is a good game.

274
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,225
Scott: It's like a good warm-up game.

275
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,616
Scott: It's not the game that you seek out.

276
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,399
Scott: It's just the warm-up.

277
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,840
Rym: Yeah, like you play that to get the blood pumping, and then Tiggers and Euphrates.

278
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:26,419
Scott: That's right.

279
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,854
Rym: So, there was this dumb kid-looking game that for some reason, a bunch of people in our crew noticed it at PAX.

280
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:34,037
Rym: I think it was Pete or Nuri.

281
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:35,540
Rym: It's called Spot It.

282
00:13:35,904 --> 00:13:36,140
Scott: Alright.

283
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,700
Rym: And all it is is little circular cards that have shapes on them, like snowflake, or dinosaur, or green shit.

284
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,448
Scott: Well, they're not just shapes.

285
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:43,480
Scott: They're like actual pictures.

286
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,707
Rym: Hand with an eyeball, lock, bomb, all this stuff.

287
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,914
Rym: And they're all different sizes, but the shapes and colors are the same.

288
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:55,320
Rym: And every card matches every other card in at least one way.

289
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,604
Scott: Yeah, so each card has a whole bunch of different pictures on it.

290
00:13:58,644 --> 00:14:04,432
Scott: So, you got one card might have a really small snowman, and another card might have a really big snowman.

291
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:10,080
Scott: They're the same snowman, but they also have a whole bunch of other symbols, so it's like how you can even notice that snowman is there.

292
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,685
Rym: Now, the thing is, the game is actually a whole bunch of different games.

293
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:20,794
Rym: The baby mode, as we like to call it, there's a pile in the middle, everyone's got their card, and everyone looks.

294
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:25,740
Rym: And if you see the match between the card in the middle and your card, you say what the match is and grab it.

295
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,475
Scott: Yeah, because every card matches every other card, so it's not like a luck factor.

296
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:31,860
Scott: Everyone's got some kind of match.

297
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,793
Rym: Now what's great, you'll think, alright, we're all adults, this baby game, really, Rym and Scott, this baby game is the game you guys are going to talk about.

298
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,640
Rym: This game made me feel real fucking stupid sometimes.

299
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:46,280
Scott: Yeah, you'd be like eyeball, eyeball, eyeball, eyeball.

300
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:53,910
Rym: There'd be like four of us, four smart dudes, all of us 20 to 30 years old dudes and dudettes, sitting around looking at this thing.

301
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:58,737
Rym: We all know there is a match for every one of us, and yet none of us can match.

302
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:01,100
Rym: For like 30 seconds.

303
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,488
Scott: Well, because some cards, it's just all about coincidence, right?

304
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:08,180
Scott: You'll grab a card, and then the next card will have that same symbol again.

305
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:10,240
Rym: Oh, there you go, lightning bolt, lightning bolt, lightning bolt.

306
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:20,854
Scott: Right, but then sometimes your card will have like a whole bunch of blue symbols, and this card, the only match will be a green symbol, but that green symbol is really tiny on both cards.

307
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:25,340
Scott: It's like you're never going to notice it, and someone else, by the time you figure it out, someone else has got it.

308
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,880
Rym: Yep, but the end result is that it's actually a pretty great game.

309
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,600
Scott: It's definitely a game of complete skill based stuff, right?

310
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:43,240
Rym: It replaced jungle speed for one type of activity, because when we were in lines, playing games, you couldn't really whip out the jungle speed, because there was a lot more setup going on, we needed more space.

311
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,480
Scott: You need a table with a totem, you gotta be even around the totem.

312
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,300
Rym: There's the danger of hitting other people in line with that totem.

313
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,289
Scott: Yeah, spot it, you can pretty much play on any surface.

314
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:54,440
Scott: It doesn't have as many physical requirements as jungle speed.

315
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,360
Rym: But it has other modes, and they're actually all pretty great.

316
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:05,680
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is the basic mode is like actually, while it's the baby mode, it's the most simplistic, it's also the highest, the one that's the most skill based, right?

317
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:07,080
Rym: Well, I would argue- The dick mode.

318
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,620
Rym: Dick mode is also high skill, but among low skilled players, it's also a low skilled game.

319
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:19,020
Scott: Yeah, the problem with dick mode is that there is skill to it, but there is a greater factor of it's also the vote who wins game.

320
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,560
Rym: Well here's the deal, when to play dick mode, you unzip your pants, and you whip it out, you put it on, and everyone- okay.

321
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,980
Rym: So, the pile is in the middle, and everyone has a card in front of them.

322
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:34,080
Rym: If you see a match with anyone else's card, you say lightning bolt or whatever and you put it on their pile, lowest pile wins.

323
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:42,160
Scott: Yeah, so it's like you have to try to match with the person who's not you that has the smallest pile to spread the damage around to make sure everyone else loses.

324
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,352
Rym: Now obviously, among low skilled players, the game is basically who doesn't get noticed.

325
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,900
Rym: The quietest people would win this every time.

326
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,765
Scott: Yeah, regardless of their spotting skill, right?

327
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:55,740
Scott: So the baby mode is the best at testing your spotting skill, where dick mode tests other skills as well.

328
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:06,300
Rym: But dick mode, the real thing, what it tests is the ability to not only keep track of that card up there, to keep track of all the other cards in real time, and to keep track of who's winning and who's losing.

329
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:15,300
Rym: And they have modes like everyone holds a card, then when you find a match between your card and someone else's, you give it to them, and then you keep going until there's one guy left with all the cards and he loses.

330
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:15,900
Scott: Is that a hot potato mode?

331
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:17,000
Rym: I don't even know.

332
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,518
Scott: I don't even know.

333
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,720
Rym: We have our own vulgar names for every mode.

334
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,599
Scott: The thing is, this deck of cards with all these symbols on it is actually surprisingly versatile at playing a whole bunch of different games, and it's super cheap.

335
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,860
Scott: We paid 12, but on Sunday, they lowered the price to 9.

336
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,219
Rym: It's 10.08 on Amazon with free shipping right now.

337
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,675
Scott: You can't buy a better game for $10 a game.

338
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,899
Rym: Dude, it fits in the pocket of my kilt.

339
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:40,162
Rym: Yeah.

340
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:41,909
Scott: Well, I mean, a bottle of wine fits in there.

341
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:43,455
Scott: It fits in a jean pocket.

342
00:17:44,218 --> 00:17:44,640
Scott: Tightly.

343
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,920
Rym: I think the highest endorsement I have for this game is that our friend bought it, and we were like, "Whatever," and we played it, and then we liked it.

344
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:56,160
Rym: I bought it, and everyone else bought it, and as far as I can tell, the dealer sold out of this game.

345
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,380
Scott: There was only one dealer selling it in the expo hall.

346
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:04,260
Rym: Nobody would have looked at this game twice otherwise, but it spread very quickly through packs.

347
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,560
Scott: Mad props to whoever started the slippery slope on the spot-its.

348
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,384
Rym: We've got a really good loadout now.

349
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:12,892
Rym: We've got the jungle speed, the banana grams, the spot-it.

350
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:15,300
Rym: We've got the whip-it-out-at-a-restaurant-games-down.

351
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,423
Scott: Yeah, we need more.

352
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:21,660
Scott: The thing is, we already have the long, awesome games with lots of wooden cubes down.

353
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,087
Scott: We just can't get people to play those.

354
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:25,820
Scott: People just want to keep playing the restaurant games over and over and over.

355
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:31,820
Scott: We've got to get people to migrate from the banana grams to the Le Havre or Le Genoa and such.

356
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,549
Rym: And so, without further ado, it's been a while.

357
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:43,320
Rym: We've got a long backlog of Things of the Day.

358
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,405
Scott: Oh, snap.

359
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,820
Scott: I don't actually have a Thing of the Day.

360
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:46,250
Scott: What?

361
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:46,620
Scott: Really?

362
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,760
Scott: I've got a Thing of the Day.

363
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,069
Rym: We just talked about this for like ever.

364
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:50,640
Rym: Alright, well, I'll stall for you a little bit.

365
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,207
Rym: By Thing of the Day, I'm going back to CollegeHumor, but not just some dumb video on their side, because they've actually... You know, we're big fans of CollegeHumor.

366
00:18:58,227 --> 00:19:01,660
Rym: They're one of the best video content aggregators on the internet.

367
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,845
Rym: At least of fun video content.

368
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:09,920
Rym: I mean, I guess TEDx and TED could be arguably the best overall aggregators of actual worthwhile video content.

369
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,144
Rym: But I digress.

370
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:13,734
Rym: Obviously, still stalling for time, as Scott not saying anything.

371
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:15,120
Rym: He's desperately trying to find a Thing of the Day.

372
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:23,600
Rym: So, CollegeHumor has done a lot of original shows that have actually been pretty damn good, and I think the best one right now is Troopers.

373
00:19:23,781 --> 00:19:28,880
Rym: It's basically just kind of a Star Wars spoof about the stormtroopers living their normal lives.

374
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:35,500
Rym: You know, talking to each other, being dicks, guarding the princess, interrogating the princess, getting coffee for Darth Vader.

375
00:19:37,104 --> 00:19:41,160
Rym: And stuff like this on the internet, if it were anywhere else, would usually be pretty lame.

376
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:44,800
Rym: And a lot of the early CollegeHumor original videos were pretty lame.

377
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:50,900
Rym: But this is top-notch, like A, production values, and it's like a solid B, comedy.

378
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:57,960
Rym: Like, I put it on the level of, I don't know, I'd say this is what I would call the baseline level for a modern, low-budget internet sitcom.

379
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,579
Rym: Like, it's the equivalent of what Seinfeld was on TV.

380
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:04,660
Scott: Alright, I do have a Thing of the Day.

381
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:05,820
Rym: So, that was enough stalling?

382
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:07,684
Scott: Yeah.

383
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:08,124
Scott: Maybe.

384
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:15,120
Scott: I was going to use this Thing of the Day on Monday, but you know what, it's okay to use on Tuesday, because it's also partially gaming-related.

385
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,364
Scott: And we haven't used it yet.

386
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:20,600
Scott: And it's one of those things that everyone on the internet has seen, because it exploded everywhere.

387
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:22,940
Scott: But it's gotta be a Thing of the Day, right?

388
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,417
Rym: The My Little Pony Epic AMV?

389
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:25,639
Scott: No, we used that already.

390
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,120
Scott: Yeah?

391
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,659
Scott: This is something we haven't used already.

392
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:27,994
Scott: Alright.

393
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:37,160
Scott: This guy upgraded from MS-DOS 5.0 all the way to every version of Windows, all the way up to Windows 7, right?

394
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:45,519
Scott: And it's surprising that actually, you know, from watching this, I have to believe he actually ended up with a better version of Windows at the end.

395
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:51,496
Scott: Because he actually had some of the Windows 3.1 apps that could possibly be useful, like the recorder.

396
00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:52,940
Scott: Who knows if that would still actually work.

397
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:02,659
Rym: See, the tricky part is that some PCs, like if you switch to 64-bit or whatever, the upgrade path, the official one from Windows is, "Yeah, wipe all your shit out, start

398
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:02,820
Rym: over.".

399
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,600
Scott: Yeah, I think he did 32-bit only, which is the problem.

400
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,527
Rym: Which is fine, because otherwise this isn't nearly as cool.

401
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:13,840
Rym: I mean, yeah, I can upgrade from every version of anything to anything else by wiping out my hard drive between each step.

402
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:20,600
Scott: It was just sort of amazing how he put in Doom at the beginning, and Doom continued to work on almost every version.

403
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,620
Scott: And then for one version it stopped working, but then after he upgraded again, it started working again.

404
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,846
Rym: I didn't actually watch it.

405
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,480
Rym: Does he go the ME path, or does he just kind of skip that?

406
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:37,781
Scott: I don't remember if he does ME, but he does 95, 98, and then he either does ME 2000 or just straight to 2000.

407
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:39,464
Scott: It's a really good video.

408
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:47,280
Scott: It's totally worth watching, especially for people with the nostalgia of the old DOS days, playing games on the old DOS, this'll be awesome.

409
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,920
Scott: And for people who have never seen old Windows and old DOS, you'll learn a lot from this, of what it was like in those olden days.

410
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,660
Rym: Alright, so the meta moment, which for new listeners, this is where we try to cover all the stuff about GeekNights.

411
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,052
Rym: So if you are a new listener, we got a forum, it's rockin', you should go to it.

412
00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:08,680
Rym: It's actually rockin', people will vouch for that.

413
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:09,980
Scott: And you should follow us on Twitters.

414
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,202
Rym: Yup.

415
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:17,860
Rym: If you saw us at the con and you thought we were cool, and Scott didn't want to take his picture with you, it's because he hates people and pictures and puppies.

416
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,400
Scott: I don't know why, the thing is I just don't know why anyone would want to take their picture with me.

417
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,859
Rym: It's always funny when, you know, you can see our two personalities, when a fan is like "Oh my god, I love Geek

418
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:28,060
Rym: Nights.".

419
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:30,329
Rym: I'll be like "Well, I'm glad you do, this is super

420
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:30,671
Rym: awesome.".

421
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:32,498
Rym: And I'm thinking "I'm so fuckin' awesome, aw

422
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:32,719
Rym: yeah.".

423
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,754
Rym: And Scott's like "Why the hell do you listen to GeekNights?

424
00:22:34,835 --> 00:22:35,016
Rym: It

425
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:35,298
Rym: sucks.".

426
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:36,438
Scott: What's wrong with you?

427
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,858
Scott: Do you have anything better to do?

428
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:42,980
Rym: I don't know, if I have any, if Scott has a pony name, it is henceforth Complainy Main.

429
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:43,658
Scott: Okay, sure.

430
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:45,219
Rym: After this weekend at Zenkai Con.

431
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,257
Rym: "Oh, there's no bagels in the morning and I can't get

432
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:49,739
Rym: breakfast.".

433
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,520
Scott: Did you not agree with that complaint?

434
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:54,120
Rym: I got a Philly cheesesteak for breakfast, so I was fine.

435
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,980
Scott: That is not breakfast.

436
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:59,600
Scott: Anyway, just, you know, some events coming up in the near future.

437
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:01,458
Scott: There's a Nerd NYC board game night, April 1st.

438
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,660
Rym: April 1st, I'll be bringing Candyland.

439
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:09,476
Scott: There's gonna be the MOCA Festival, the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art Festival is on April 9th and 10th.

440
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,499
Scott: We're probably gonna go on the 9th all day.

441
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,531
Rym: We'll be there, so if you want to say hi, say hi.

442
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:15,980
Rym: We're not doing any panels or anything.

443
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:21,597
Scott: There's a convention in Long Island that we never go to and probably never will go to called ICON on the weekend following, the 15th, 16th, and 17th.

444
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,220
Rym: Much more important, April 22nd through 24th in Boston at the Heinz Convention Center.

445
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:31,760
Rym: We will be at, as we always are, except possibly next year, Anime Boston.

446
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:33,411
Scott: A real convention.

447
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:33,613
Scott: A big one.

448
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:37,220
Rym: And I'm looking forward to it primarily.

449
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,564
Rym: I love Anime Boston.

450
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,020
Rym: It's kind of replaced Otakon in many ways for me as an attendee and a fan.

451
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,987
Rym: But it's in the Heinz, which is a fairly crappy convention center that actually- No, actually I like the Heinz.

452
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:50,760
Scott: It's good, it just doesn't have the size necessary.

453
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:53,200
Rym: It's crappy if you want to be a big convention.

454
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,750
Scott: Well, I mean, you could be big in there.

455
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,960
Scott: You just can't be ultra big.

456
00:23:56,742 --> 00:23:57,618
Rym: There's food over there.

457
00:23:58,163 --> 00:23:58,878
Scott: Oh, there's the best food.

458
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,160
Rym: Oh my god, there's food over there.

459
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,653
Scott: King P.

460
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:05,460
Rym: Ah, the Trident, the secret place that I'm no longer ever gonna mention on the show.

461
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:11,180
Scott: 'Cause we ate there once and it was the best breakfast and we tried to eat there the next day and it was too full because everyone found out about it.

462
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,349
Scott: Yep.

463
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,020
Scott: So now we're not gonna tell anyone that it exists so we can go eat the awesome breakfast every day.

464
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,711
Rym: Oh my god, that vanilla french toast.

465
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:18,939
Scott: I can't even get over that.

466
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,339
Rym: God.

467
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,600
Rym: Yep, so we will be at Anime Boston doing a whole bunch of panels along with our friends Anime World Order and Mike Tool.

468
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:27,882
Scott: Yep.

469
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:34,520
Scott: And the weekend following Anime Boston, we're probably not gonna go to it 'cause I really don't want to go back to Pennsylvania on such short notice.

470
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,788
Scott: But the Comic Geek Speak podcast is a podcast I listen to.

471
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:41,800
Scott: They got their own convention that they've been doing for a couple years now and it's gonna be on that weekend.

472
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,580
Rym: When are we gonna do the GeekNights convention?

473
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,620
Scott: April 30th and May 1st in Reading, Pennsylvania.

474
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:46,968
Scott: Huh?

475
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:48,839
Scott: The Comic Geek Speak Super Show.

476
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:51,494
Scott: You can not like that name.

477
00:24:51,535 --> 00:24:52,079
Scott: That's a good name.

478
00:24:52,380 --> 00:25:00,040
Rym: And of course if you saw any of our panels at Zank icon or PAX, look at the news on the site because we link to most of the slides.

479
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,320
Rym: So if you want to see like the list of board games we talked about.

480
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:09,092
Scott: Yeah, go to FrontRowCrew.com and then look in the bottom left and there'll be latest news or in the navigation bar.

481
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,637
Scott: just click news and you'll see it'll be like a blog.

482
00:25:11,698 --> 00:25:12,820
Scott: suddenly that has news.

483
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:14,330
Rym: So two last pieces.

484
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,920
Rym: then we'll get on to our PAX highlights.

485
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:27,920
Rym: One, if you saw us at a convention or you would like us to go to a convention, tell the convention and tell them to ask for us because we are kind of, our cup already overflowed.

486
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:30,752
Rym: We're not really looking for new conventions to go to.

487
00:25:30,772 --> 00:25:32,380
Rym: A convention has to come to us at this point.

488
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:32,973
Scott: Yeah.

489
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:34,539
Rym: Otherwise we won't know it exists.

490
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,180
Scott: Yep.

491
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:39,640
Rym: And if it's in the New York area and there's not a bigger con at the same weekend, there's a chance it will come.

492
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,147
Scott: Yeah, there's sort of this equation, right?

493
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,980
Scott: Size of con versus hassle to get to the con.

494
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,939
Scott: So if the, you know, and so it's like, if it's far away, then it's a hassle, but if it's really big, it might be worth it.

495
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:52,840
Rym: Or if it's really awesome, like magfest.

496
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,481
Scott: Exactly.

497
00:25:53,582 --> 00:25:56,020
Scott: But it also depends on the transportation, right?

498
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,390
Scott: So like, for example, we didn't go to generic con even though it was very close.

499
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:00,212
Scott: Why?

500
00:26:00,513 --> 00:26:02,620
Scott: Because it was a pain in the ass to get to it.

501
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,001
Rym: Yep.

502
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:05,680
Rym: We didn't do panels really ever at Anime Next.

503
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,440
Rym: And it was small.

504
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,739
Rym: No one ever responds to our emails and eventually we gave up.

505
00:26:09,103 --> 00:26:09,305
Scott: Yep.

506
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:10,580
Scott: So anyway.

507
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,100
Rym: Yep.

508
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,959
Rym: That and also the second point, we are, as many of you know, the directors of programming for panels and workshops at ConnectiCon every year.

509
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:19,998
Scott: And... Since last year?

510
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,420
Rym: Yep.

511
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:21,142
Rym: Since last year.

512
00:26:21,483 --> 00:26:27,540
Rym: And ConnectiCon is kind of an everything con, but unlike cons that call themselves everything cons, it really is a goddamn everything con.

513
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:28,799
Scott: It's an everything nerdy con.

514
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,800
Rym: It's like a steampunk anime gaming webcomic art con.

515
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:41,879
Scott: Regular comic, anime, board game, miniatures, video game, nerdy con, crafting, knitting.

516
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:51,980
Rym: We wanted to open panel submissions in October, but due to internal things over which we have no control in the convention, everyone else, not everyone else.

517
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:59,240
Rym: We haven't even yet opened registration for panels, despite the fact that the convention is in July.

518
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:04,695
Scott: And the convention is already, like, the period of which you could get your $40 badge has already passed.

519
00:27:04,775 --> 00:27:06,440
Scott: Now the badge prices have already gone up.

520
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:18,620
Rym: But if you live anywhere near Hartford, Connecticut and you want to go to a 7,000 person con or a 21,000 person con if you count it the BS way PAX counts, then just wait for it.

521
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:24,320
Rym: We'll announce when we open submissions and if you're a listener who does cool stuff, we're in charge of panels.

522
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:32,600
Scott: And Kinetic Con may be small compared to PAX and other things, but the tabletop gaming there is worth the price of admission alone, not counting the awesome panels we're gonna have.

523
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,859
Rym: Tabletop at Kinetic Con is better than any gaming con I've ever been to except to PAX.

524
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:47,160
Scott: I think the thing is, like the tabletop room, the PAX now has bigger tabletop and perhaps more and better players, but the library at Kinetic Con is unmatched.

525
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,460
Rym: Oh my god, that library.

526
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:56,120
Scott: The PAX tabletop gaming library is not as good, not even half as good, as the Kinetic Con tabletop gaming library.

527
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,143
Rym: Alright, so, PAX.

528
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:06,320
Rym: We usually do these kind of very long-winded convention reviews, but I think we've been to enough PAXes to where we don't need to tell you that there's an expo hall.

529
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:12,216
Scott: Yeah, let's just stick to the things that were different about PAX East 2011 versus previous PAXes.

530
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:24,100
Rym: So, if you care about, like, the details of what it's like at PAX on a general level, like, oh, the concerts and the panels and the art, well, there is no artist alley yet, but the, like, all that stuff.

531
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,340
Rym: We've got, I don't know, like three or four other PAX episodes I'll link to.

532
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,299
Scott: Yeah, just go listen to those.

533
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:31,660
Rym: This year was exactly the same, except for the following.

534
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:41,760
Scott: And if you're one of those people who hates the convention shows, stop listening, because you know what, a lot of people tell us they do like the convention shows and it's pretty much equal and we don't have another idea for today.

535
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:49,300
Rym: However, I would say don't stop listening because we're not going to do the kind of review you seem to hate and you might want to hear some of this stuff.

536
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,100
Scott: Or your opinion might be reinforced.

537
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,240
Rym: Alright, so in no particular order, it was in the BCEC in the middle of fuck nowhere.

538
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,406
Scott: Yeah, we've never been to the BCEC before, new building for us.

539
00:28:58,627 --> 00:29:01,013
Scott: It was a gigantic, basically I think Mike Tool had it right.

540
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:03,800
Scott: He said it's an airplane hangar that happens to be empty.

541
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:08,707
Rym: Now, it's relatively new, and that counts for more than you would think.

542
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:16,800
Rym: The BCC in Baltimore is, so far to this day, the best extremely large convention venue I have ever laid eyes upon.

543
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:17,440
Scott: Architecturally.

544
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,965
Scott: Yeah, forget the city, forget the cons, anything else.

545
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:26,499
Rym: The actual building, the layout of the convention center, the variety of spaces, the size of the spaces, the BCC.

546
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,603
Rym: The layout of the spaces.

547
00:29:27,863 --> 00:29:30,953
Scott: The only flaw of the BCC is the road and bridge in the middle.

548
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,180
Scott: No other flaw does it have.

549
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,711
Rym: Like it is perfect, and it is actually way bigger than the BCEC in Boston.

550
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:41,540
Rym: And I'll just harken back to when they first announced there was going to be a Pax East.

551
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,999
Rym: When they said Boston, I said what?

552
00:29:44,806 --> 00:29:44,996
Scott: Yeah.

553
00:29:45,763 --> 00:29:47,160
Rym: But Boston's working out okay.

554
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:47,870
Scott: Yeah.

555
00:29:48,202 --> 00:29:48,291
Scott: Yeah.

556
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,871
Scott: Except for the fact the problem with the BCC is, as he predicted, there's not much near it.

557
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:56,040
Scott: You gotta walk a distance to get to anything.

558
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,380
Rym: And even then, you'll walk a distance.

559
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:06,560
Scott: There's not much variety, and the stuff that's close is packed, because especially if you want to eat dinner at a reasonable hour, all the Pax people are already in there three hour wait to eat at this really good place.

560
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:12,154
Rym: So I think our mistake on every day other than Friday was that we tried to go to a nice restaurant.

561
00:30:12,174 --> 00:30:13,036
Rym: You know what we should have done?

562
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,480
Rym: Ordered pizza every day.

563
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:14,705
Rym: Yeah.

564
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,978
Rym: Because that actually worked.

565
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,783
Scott: It did work.

566
00:30:17,104 --> 00:30:20,040
Scott: The go to the Mexican place worked, but I wasn't going to eat there more than once.

567
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,341
Scott: Yep.

568
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:27,677
Rym: But seriously, this venue, while smaller than the BCC, basically consists of three airplane hangers.

569
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:29,140
Rym: Like gigantic rooms.

570
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:29,948
Scott: Well, it's actually one.

571
00:30:29,989 --> 00:30:30,879
Scott: They just had two dividers.

572
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,481
Rym: Yep.

573
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:35,740
Rym: And only one of them was actually really, well I guess two of them were used.

574
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,940
Scott: Yeah, it was divided into four sections actually.

575
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:39,390
Rym: Yeah, I forgot.

576
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:39,860
Scott: Daddy four.

577
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,080
Scott: It was an airplane hanger divided into four pretty much sort of equal-ish sections.

578
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,341
Scott: Right.

579
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:51,060
Scott: The first section was expo hall, then tabletop, then the queue room, which they only use that queue room for the expo hall.

580
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,700
Scott: They actually put the main events queue up in the main events area, which is different.

581
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,835
Scott: And they only ever actually used half of that queue room at most.

582
00:31:00,122 --> 00:31:02,674
Scott: And then there was a cafeteria area, which was secret.

583
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:03,639
Scott: tabletop number two.

584
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,598
Rym: Yeah, it was great.

585
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,220
Scott: It was tabletop number one was so crowded.

586
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,347
Rym: So it was pretty great on Friday night.

587
00:31:08,387 --> 00:31:11,980
Rym: It was basically us and a whole bunch of bronies and listeners and crew hanging out.

588
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,740
Rym: So there's like 30, 40 of us in this room just kind of spread out.

589
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,620
Rym: The room is the size of a football field and we're the only ones in it except for the sleeping security guy.

590
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:33,700
Rym: There's this one PCEC security dude asleep on the far end, like passed out in a chair near the gigantic garage door that you could drive like a, you know, gigantic truck.

591
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,160
Rym: I really wanted to have all of us quietly walk over and just stand around him and wait for him to wake up.

592
00:31:38,604 --> 00:31:40,080
Scott: Yeah, I don't think that would have been great.

593
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,400
Scott: That would have meant losing Paxman.

594
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:44,119
Rym: It might have been getting tased.

595
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:44,824
Scott: Maybe.

596
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:45,800
Scott: I don't think he had a taser.

597
00:31:47,661 --> 00:31:51,459
Rym: But yeah, they actually didn't notice we were there because the con ended it too.

598
00:31:52,282 --> 00:31:55,079
Rym: And we were still there and no one came to check on us.

599
00:31:55,863 --> 00:31:58,319
Rym: And we didn't really run into many people on our way out.

600
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:06,900
Scott: But yeah, basically there are a bunch of smaller rooms on two different levels on the sort of, you know, the hallways on either side of the airplane.

601
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:08,387
Rym: Panel rooms are gigantic.

602
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:11,200
Rym: Now Pax has no problem with panel room size anymore.

603
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,125
Scott: Yeah, they don't fill up.

604
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:14,680
Scott: You don't really have to wait that long unless you want to sit close.

605
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,320
Scott: Or unless it's famous person panel, which was not our panel.

606
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,790
Scott: You know, we had one, our one panel had half attendance.

607
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,840
Scott: The other ones on Sunday filled up mostly, but not a hundred percent.

608
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,200
Scott: So you could have, you didn't have to wait in line.

609
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,267
Rym: Yeah, the room seated like twelve hundred or nine.

610
00:32:28,307 --> 00:32:28,568
Rym: I forget.

611
00:32:28,588 --> 00:32:31,940
Rym: I think it was twelve hundred in the big room and I, it might have been a thousand.

612
00:32:32,402 --> 00:32:33,939
Rym: And we were like 90 percent full.

613
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,234
Rym: Yeah.

614
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:35,640
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

615
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,364
Rym: Friday's tough though, it was a constant concert.

616
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:43,840
Rym: But I mean, everything else about the venue is great, but I can't understate the value of having a new convention center.

617
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:52,920
Rym: Because while the layout kind of is like the Javits and that it's big and open and echoey, the sound and the loudness weren't nearly as bad as I expected just due to modern engineering.

618
00:32:53,100 --> 00:33:00,460
Scott: My only, my only real problem was the surrounding area, which we knew about, and the fact that because it was a big airplane hangar, walking to anywhere took forever.

619
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,433
Rym: Oh my god, we were playing this game of Paranoia in the cafeteria area, and I was like, I'll be right back.

620
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:08,260
Rym: I'm gonna go get a drink from that drinking fountain that we could all see.

621
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:14,120
Rym: It took me more than ten minutes to walk to that drinking fountain, get a drink, and walk back.

622
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,200
Scott: Yeah, it's a long way.

623
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,720
Rym: I could see the Paranoia game that was on hold the entire time.

624
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,839
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty impressively large.

625
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,820
Rym: Also, TableTop, there were so many thousands of people, like it was crazy to see that many people playing TableTop games.

626
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,880
Scott: They should have expanded the TableTop to take up half of the Q room and made the Q room half the size, and then they could have eliminated the cafeteria area entirely.

627
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,580
Rym: But anyway, there's really no trouble with the venue, other than the obvious stuff of it's in the middle of nowhere, and PAX ain't moving.

628
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,702
Rym: I have it on good authority.

629
00:33:44,742 --> 00:33:52,360
Rym: now, the maximum capacity of the BCEC, as it stands, is 24,000 people, which is actually pretty small.

630
00:33:52,941 --> 00:33:54,872
Scott: The true capacity has to be bigger than that.

631
00:33:54,912 --> 00:33:56,340
Scott: That sounds like a stingy Fire Marshal.

632
00:33:56,561 --> 00:34:00,240
Scott: But I've met the Fire Marshal of Boston, and he's an awesome dude, so I don't know why he'd do that.

633
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,709
Rym: So I looked into this a little bit.

634
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:03,460
Rym: I did some investigative journalism.

635
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,420
Rym: The BCEC and the city of Boston will not tell me what the maximum capacity is.

636
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,359
Rym: They outright refuse to tell me.

637
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:20,856
Rym: And when I said I have it on good authority from several other sources that your capacity is 24,000, they didn't respond.

638
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:22,260
Rym: They just stopped answering my emails.

639
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:24,646
Rym: And I even threatened them.

640
00:34:24,686 --> 00:34:29,658
Rym: I was like, "Look, I'm going to go to press with the number of 24,000 and assume that is correct unless you tell me

641
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:30,199
Rym: otherwise.".

642
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:31,478
Rym: No responses.

643
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:38,620
Rym: I also learned, and I have this on pretty good authority, PAX is by far the biggest event that has ever been hosted in that center.

644
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,838
Scott: That's probably correct.

645
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,020
Scott: And I'm pretty sure they're building another hotel near the center.

646
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,964
Scott: There are plans.

647
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:52,179
Scott: They're trying to get 200 million dollars in state funds to build another hotel attached to that center.

648
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:56,620
Scott: To move Boston up the hierarchy of best convention cities.

649
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:03,397
Rym: Yes, if they built an extension like the BCC did in Baltimore, they could usurp the BCC completely.

650
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:04,439
Rym: They could kill Baltimore.

651
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,900
Rym: I keep almost saying Boston and Baltimore in the wrong spaces.

652
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,136
Rym: But yeah, it worked out pretty well.

653
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:11,559
Rym: keynote.

654
00:35:13,262 --> 00:35:14,460
Rym: The keynote was fantastic.

655
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,280
Scott: I like how she didn't spend 100 years talking about her gaming history and instead actually talked about a topic.

656
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:21,546
Rym: Yeah, it was a great topic.

657
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,620
Rym: We played a bunch of games with her and the audience that were pretty good.

658
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:30,280
Scott: Yeah, and she taught us a lot of interesting things about chicken knee bowling or whatever you call it.

659
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,480
Rym: I kind of want to play barkball.

660
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,040
Scott: I don't want to play barkball.

661
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,880
Rym: You don't want to play barkball?

662
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:34,085
Scott: No.

663
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,700
Rym: It was a heartfelt, meaningful, awesome keynote.

664
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:40,703
Scott: Educational.

665
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,070
Scott: Much better than Wil Wheaton.

666
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,739
Scott: It was just pandering the whole time.

667
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,039
Rym: Yes, but at the same time...

668
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,059
Scott: But the thing is, I have a feeling that many people will not share that opinion with us.

669
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:51,187
Rym: Well, my opinion is complex.

670
00:35:51,268 --> 00:35:59,140
Rym: When I say that Wil Wheaton did the worst keynote PAX has ever had, that's like saying that this 23 karat bar of gold is the worst bar of gold I've ever had.

671
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,696
Rym: I mean, it was a great keynote when...

672
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,020
Scott: It was okay.

673
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,089
Rym: Well, it was a rah rah rah.

674
00:36:05,149 --> 00:36:07,220
Rym: It was a look at what gaming does to us.

675
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,419
Rym: We are who we are because of gaming and gaming is what it is because of us.

676
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,320
Rym: And the message was good, just the whole middle was basically the woo game.

677
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:16,896
Scott: Yeah.

678
00:36:17,423 --> 00:36:19,052
Rym: Which, sometimes you need that.

679
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:20,360
Rym: Sometimes you need the rah rah rah.

680
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,609
Rym: I feel like PAX can alternate between serious business.

681
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:27,500
Rym: let's go and rah rah rah, we're so fucking awesome, look at us.

682
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,673
Scott: Well, whatever.

683
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:29,533
Scott: Yeah.

684
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:34,020
Scott: I prefer the educational TED talk to a rah rah rah.

685
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:35,666
Rym: I like them both pretty much equally.

686
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:39,300
Rym: I can watch an entertaining thing and enjoy it independently of an educational thing.

687
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,100
Rym: Though, the things that do both are rated higher on my absolute scale of awesome.

688
00:36:43,883 --> 00:36:44,034
Scott: Anyway.

689
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:49,877
Rym: The Q&A, the famous Penny Arcade Q&A, East Coast, you kind of let me down.

690
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:50,840
Rym: There was no knuckle crack.

691
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,690
Scott: No knuckle crack.

692
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:52,340
Scott: I was like, what?

693
00:36:53,222 --> 00:36:53,620
Rym: What the fuck?

694
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:57,655
Rym: And all these people were tweeting like, I should ask about my little pony, blah blah blah.

695
00:36:57,895 --> 00:36:59,080
Rym: Nobody fucking stepped up.

696
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,560
Rym: I went up there to ask about something else, but I had to do the ponies because clearly no one else was gonna.

697
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,434
Scott: Yeah, I don't think you had anything else.

698
00:37:05,535 --> 00:37:06,080
Scott: I didn't have anything.

699
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,438
Rym: I did, but someone stole it.

700
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:09,100
Scott: Oh, right.

701
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:18,540
Rym: Yeah, so two years ago, well, I guess, yeah, at the first PAX East, you know, at the end of the show, Tycho was like, this is truly the real PAX.

702
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:20,960
Scott: And then at PAX West, you called him out.

703
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,697
Rym: Yep, I was like, so.

704
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,480
Scott: And then that's when he called PAX East the bitch PAX.

705
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,583
Rym: Yep, I was like, so.

706
00:37:25,603 --> 00:37:31,180
Rym: You, uh, there were, you know, we were very, emotions were running high at the end of PAX East last year.

707
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:34,892
Rym: And I believe someone, it might have been you, said that it was the real PAX.

708
00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:35,815
Rym: And of course, boos.

709
00:37:36,598 --> 00:37:37,060
Scott: Boos.

710
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,083
Scott: And then of course, right?

711
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:43,240
Scott: So some guy who wasn't us comes up on this Q&A and is like, so this is bitch PAX, huh?

712
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,811
Rym: And his reaction was priceless.

713
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,277
Rym: He's like, oh my God, look.

714
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,560
Scott: He's like, he knew that it was going to create a cycle and he did not want it to continue.

715
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,779
Scott: But apparently PAX West, PAX Prime is a den of thieves.

716
00:37:58,643 --> 00:37:59,330
Rym: I like this trend.

717
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,420
Rym: I think what's going to happen now.

718
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:02,039
Scott: So a den of thieves, are we?

719
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:08,320
Rym: Every year he is going to denigrate the other one rather than propping up the one he's at because that is more entertaining.

720
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,479
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

721
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,338
Rym: So speaking of fail.

722
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,079
Scott: The joke will get old.

723
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,749
Rym: There's one more very important fail.

724
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,440
Rym: East Coast, seriously, you're letting me down.

725
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,880
Rym: We talk up the East Coast to our West Coast posse and you guys totally don't stand and deliver.

726
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:28,940
Rym: At PAX East last year, Bohemian Rhapsody played and the line was moving into the Omegathon finale.

727
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:31,740
Rym: The line kept singing the song.

728
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,058
Scott: There is video evidence of this.

729
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,100
Rym: Long after no one could hear the original music.

730
00:38:36,384 --> 00:38:37,059
Scott: Video evidence.

731
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,959
Scott: We made it through the instrumentals.

732
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,460
Scott: PAX West has never achieved such a feat.

733
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,640
Rym: Can you imagine an entire crowd singing Bohemian Rhapsody, including the instrumentals.

734
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:47,300
Scott: Thousands and thousands of people.

735
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:47,964
Rym: Just unending.

736
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:50,020
Rym: And then when it ended, people tried to start it again.

737
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,660
Rym: So we're in line for the Omegathon finale.

738
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:55,133
Rym: We play Bohemian Rhapsody.

739
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:56,220
Rym: Everyone can hear us.

740
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,140
Rym: We have like 10 people singing it as loud as we can.

741
00:38:59,543 --> 00:39:01,400
Rym: I've got Fall Out Boy dancing.

742
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,159
Rym: No motherfucking person even considered joining in.

743
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,056
Rym: We sang the entire song to no avail.

744
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:09,560
Rym: It ended.

745
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,479
Scott: Only the security guard helped us out.

746
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,880
Rym: Okay, that security guard wins the prize for most epic burn.

747
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,099
Scott: It's actually security excellent at the BCEC.

748
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,400
Rym: Yup, in the tradition of Boston having really good security and Seattle having really good security.

749
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:22,820
Scott: What's up?

750
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,900
Scott: Well, Heinz had annoying security at points.

751
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,748
Rym: Wasn't that bad.

752
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:26,860
Rym: It was no Baltimore.

753
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,280
Scott: It was definitely no Baltimore.

754
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:29,420
Scott: And it was no Connecticut.

755
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,118
Scott: Yeah, Koo apparently knows how to hire good security firms.

756
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,559
Scott: He knows what to look for.

757
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,000
Scott: If I ever need to hire security guards, I'll ask him for advice.

758
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,583
Rym: Are you kidding?

759
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:38,520
Rym: If I ever need anything, I would ask him for advice.

760
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,719
Scott: How do I brush my teeth, Robert Koo?

761
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:43,419
Rym: He's like an oracle for these dark days.

762
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:46,320
Rym: So this guard, right, we're singing Bohemian Rhapsody.

763
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,195
Rym: And he walks up with this look of, "Oh Jesus, you

764
00:39:48,236 --> 00:39:48,498
Rym: kids.".

765
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:51,618
Rym: And then he starts conducting like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm with

766
00:39:51,658 --> 00:39:51,799
Rym: you.".

767
00:39:52,322 --> 00:39:55,256
Rym: And then he raises his hands and says, "Now just the

768
00:39:55,336 --> 00:39:55,859
Rym: girls.".

769
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:58,619
Rym: And it gets quiet for a second.

770
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,277
Scott: Yeah, there are definitely, there are a lot.

771
00:40:01,981 --> 00:40:07,400
Scott: It's like the absolute number of ladies at PAX is a high number, but the percentage is a low number.

772
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:12,859
Rym: Yep, at PAX Prime last year, Emily noted that there was a line for the men's bathroom, but not the ladies' bathroom.

773
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:13,580
Scott: That's true.

774
00:40:15,242 --> 00:40:18,779
Rym: But that security guy gets the, I guess, the win of the con from me.

775
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:19,415
Scott: Zing.

776
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,660
Rym: There's one other guy who gets the win of the con.

777
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:23,200
Rym: So we did our panels, right?

778
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:25,800
Rym: And we got to our second panel pretty early.

779
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:29,620
Rym: So we let the audience in because there was this huge line, and we entertain them for a while.

780
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,160
Rym: We show some ponies, we talk, we did a shtick.

781
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:39,100
Rym: And while we're up there, we're like, "Yeah, man, we should, at other cons, why don't we just play the Blues Brothers music?

782
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:39,771
Rym: We're not on

783
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,138
Rym: stage.".

784
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:43,680
Rym: And we play that Blues Brothers theme, and then we run in from the back.

785
00:40:44,781 --> 00:40:45,320
Rym: Oh, that tech guy.

786
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,633
Rym: And we high-five everyone like,

787
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:46,977
Rym: "Yeah!".

788
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,811
Rym: And so we say this, and we're like, "Huh,".

789
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:50,180
Rym: and the audience thinks that's funny.

790
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,200
Rym: And then we keep setting up, and then suddenly this music starts playing.

791
00:40:53,522 --> 00:40:57,519
Rym: And I look up, and the tech guy gives us the thumbs up, and it's the Blues Brothers theme.

792
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,540
Scott: Yeah, the tech guy in the Wyvern Theater was the fucking man.

793
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,560
Rym: So we ran out of the audience, they were yelling and screaming and high-fives.

794
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,620
Scott: Yeah, the liveliers and everything.

795
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,526
Rym: That was epic.

796
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,220
Scott: Pax, you got to give the same level of technology to the far superior Naga Theater.

797
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,759
Scott: We didn't have any wireless in there.

798
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,840
Scott: Got to help out my bro, Chromatic Theory.

799
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,014
Rym: Because, Scott, I know you like some Hot Lamia action.

800
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:17,940
Rym: Naga's very similar.

801
00:41:18,201 --> 00:41:18,607
Scott: I know.

802
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,420
Scott: Very close.

803
00:41:20,742 --> 00:41:23,538
Rym: Of course, there's no Unicorn Theater, which is sad, but...

804
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:24,980
Scott: Unicorn Theater's at Prime.

805
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:28,779
Scott: Rainbow, how are you going to hit it up with some Twilight Sparkle next year?

806
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:30,710
Rym: I'm warming to rarity, actually.

807
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,240
Rym: Quite a bit.

808
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,840
Scott: Yeah, warming, but still, not as warm as anyone else.

809
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:46,840
Rym: But Wyvern Theater, dude, you've fucked things up for us now, because you realize I will have trouble getting my panel hard-on going unless someone plays the Blues Brothers theme and lets me run in and high-five the audience.

810
00:41:53,603 --> 00:41:57,240
Rym: I guess we should talk about the Omegathon, because there was a big turnabout, unexpected.

811
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:03,272
Scott: Yes, our predictions for the Omegathon were along the lines of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots and things of that nature.

812
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:04,160
Scott: Crossfire.

813
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,017
Rym: We were so sure, because one...

814
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,324
Scott: Well, here's the thing, right?

815
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:11,020
Scott: Last year, Pax East, the Omegathon was different because it was co-op.

816
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:11,607
Rym: Yup.

817
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:17,360
Scott: I looked at the list of Omegathon games for East of 2011, and none of them were co-op games.

818
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,220
Scott: Bananagrams, Jenga... I thought that they had abandoned the co-op nature of the East Omegathon.

819
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,660
Rym: Now, coupled with that, it was all tabletop stylin' for the most part.

820
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:30,160
Scott: There was one video game, I think.

821
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,319
Rym: So we were like, "Alright, what is a crazy, epic, two-player tabletop-ish

822
00:42:34,379 --> 00:42:34,620
Rym: game?".

823
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,760
Rym: And Table Tennis doesn't work, obviously, because if one guy's good, it's just not gonna be fun.

824
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:48,560
Scott: Yes, we had all assumed that all games of skill were right out, because they make for boring finales if one person has any skill at all, and they make for double boring finales if everyone sucks.

825
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:57,660
Rym: Not just that, it can't be games that have a high barrier to entry, because Table Tennis, if they both suck, it's just gonna be out, out, with, out, with, for an hour.

826
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:08,540
Rym: So, we thought long and hard, and Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, my prediction was Crossfire, knowing that, being epic, they could play the Crossfire music during every round.

827
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,495
Scott: Crossfire!

828
00:43:10,684 --> 00:43:12,300
Scott: A great follow-up to Final Countdown.

829
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:15,780
Rym: My, uh, my secondary guess was Air Hockey.

830
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:16,880
Scott: Maybe.

831
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:23,340
Rym: 'Cause tabletop, low barrier to entry, high skill cap, but not unreasonable, and nobody's good at Air Hockey.

832
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,280
Scott: Yeah, but anyway.

833
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:30,159
Rym: So, we, you know, we talked to, we go to the PAX staff, 'cause we're like, "Look, don't tell us, you probably don't even

834
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:30,420
Rym: know.".

835
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:35,780
Scott: But we wanna tell you our guesses, so that if we're correct, then it will be, you know, like, we're the man.

836
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:46,800
Rym: So I won't name names, 'cause I don't wanna reveal any secrets of who knows what and when, but there is a cool dude involved in PAX, whose game is to not know, for as long as possible, what it actually is.

837
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:52,898
Rym: So, we give this person our predictions, and he's like, "Well, I don't know, so I can't betray

838
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:53,259
Rym: anything.".

839
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:56,820
Rym: And this guy behind him, who I'm also not gonna name, starts laughing.

840
00:43:57,961 --> 00:43:58,380
Rym: Hysterically.

841
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:03,120
Rym: So he leans over, and he tells him, he tells the guy who doesn't know what the games are.

842
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:04,098
Rym: He's not bothered to know.

843
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,859
Rym: And they look at us, and they just laugh.

844
00:44:06,763 --> 00:44:08,315
Rym: So I was like, "Oh man, we're totally

845
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:08,578
Rym: right.".

846
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:11,059
Rym: We were so wrong, it was pitiful.

847
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:19,260
Scott: Right, so, against all of our, first of all, I did not realize that PAX East still is, and will probably be next year, a co-op omega-thon.

848
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:19,837
Rym: I like this.

849
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:20,859
Scott: I like this a lot.

850
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:23,540
Scott: Two, so I wasn't even thinking of co-op games.

851
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:26,320
Scott: Two, they chose a game of high skill.

852
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,138
Rym: Ika fuckin' Ruga?

853
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,512
Scott: And it was weird, because, like, I'm standing next to Dragon Master Lu, right?

854
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,719
Scott: They're like a Dreamcast game of reversing polarity, and I'm like, "They wouldn't pick Ika Ruga, that's a game of

855
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:41,979
Scott: skill.".

856
00:44:42,444 --> 00:44:43,456
Scott: And Lu is like, "It's Ika

857
00:44:43,476 --> 00:44:43,739
Scott: Ruga.".

858
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,418
Scott: And I'm like, "Yes, every clue they just said implies they might as well have just said Ika Ruga

859
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:49,820
Scott: already.".

860
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,760
Rym: It's like reading Arcane Runes, all of the words I've said make sense, but the message does not.

861
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,059
Scott: Even though they said it was Ika Ruga, and I'm like, "They just described Ika Ruga, that's what it's gonna

862
00:44:59,099 --> 00:44:59,199
Scott: be.".

863
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,120
Scott: And remember, this is a matter of seconds we're talking about, so I'm thinking faster than they're talking.

864
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:08,939
Scott: I'm like, "They just said it was Ika Ruga, effectively, but there's no way it would be, because that is a game of high

865
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:09,220
Scott: skill.".

866
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:15,010
Rym: Before the word polarity, I was like, "Chu-Chu Rockets," because he was like-- Yeah, and he said Dreamcast, I was like, "Chu-Chu Rockets,".

867
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,699
Scott: but then he was like polarity, and I'm like, "Ika

868
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:16,940
Scott: Ruga.".

869
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,099
Rym: He was like complicated and visually stimulating, and I'm like, "Yeah, Chu-Chu

870
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:20,260
Rym: Rockets.".

871
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:20,847
Scott: Yeah.

872
00:45:22,663 --> 00:45:26,039
Scott: And then Ika Ruga comes on, and I'm like, "Holy fuck, are you shitting

873
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:26,199
Scott: me?".

874
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:27,456
Rym: So here's what got me.

875
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,400
Rym: Both teams were surprisingly competent.

876
00:45:31,722 --> 00:45:34,699
Scott: Well, one team was less competent than the other team by a significant amount.

877
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:40,960
Rym: Well, the left team won by an order of magnitude, as would have been obvious from the start, but it was still pretty goddamn epic to watch.

878
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:49,080
Scott: Yeah, because one of the guys on the right team actually managed--he had skill and held out to the end, but both players on the left team had skill.

879
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,480
Scott: Though I think if it was an individual competition, the good guy on the right team would have won.

880
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,460
Rym: The score he had, just him, was pretty fucking impressive.

881
00:45:58,741 --> 00:46:08,640
Scott: Yeah, I was very surprised at the amount of skill laid down in a game that is not only a game of high skill, but also a game where memory is more important.

882
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,514
Rym: Also, I watched some clips of the operation round of the Omega-Thon.

883
00:46:12,554 --> 00:46:13,780
Rym: I kind of wish I'd been there to see that.

884
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:19,540
Scott: Also, the Jenga round was a game of giant Jenga, not normal-sized Jenga.

885
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,966
Rym: I wish I'd been there to see that.

886
00:46:21,026 --> 00:46:23,860
Rym: Had I known that, I would have gotten a line for the concert to see that live.

887
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:31,340
Scott: I definitely like the move they make where they put the Omega-Thon rounds at the beginnings of the concerts on Friday and Saturday.

888
00:46:32,201 --> 00:46:37,360
Scott: Because when they make it just like Omega-Thon round in a panel room, people don't go and it's not as exciting.

889
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:43,200
Rym: But having it be that big event, it makes every round of the Omega-Thon feel just like the end of the wizard.

890
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,199
Scott: Yeah, it's a good move.

891
00:46:44,661 --> 00:46:50,420
Rym: So, if we could change things about PAX, and there's always, you know, any con we go to, there's things we could change.

892
00:46:51,020 --> 00:47:03,840
Rym: Luckily, for PAX, it's not like other cons we go to, I won't name any, where our changes are like "mail the badges" or "don't fuck up" or, I don't know, "check the badges at the door", "have panel rooms".

893
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:14,140
Rym: But we do have suggestions for PAX, and I think PAX East is in a position to experiment in a way that West will never be able to just because of this venue.

894
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,455
Rym: This venue was "full", they could easily fit 10-15,000 more people in that place.

895
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,146
Scott: But they couldn't enforce that many more people.

896
00:47:23,206 --> 00:47:27,779
Scott: They need enforcers like "water needs hydrogen".

897
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:36,400
Rym: So, rather than say "well, let's just make it bigger and have tabletop twice as big", I think we could do something very simple.

898
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:41,020
Rym: One, they had an overflow room for the concerts and all the main events, including the keynote.

899
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,466
Rym: That was brilliant.

900
00:47:42,506 --> 00:47:43,514
Rym: That room seats like 700 people.

901
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,559
Scott: Yep, totally worked.

902
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,120
Rym: But it was never even full, even though all the concerts were full, like no one got in.

903
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,900
Rym: People lined up, they shut the doors, no one else got in.

904
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,260
Scott: Well, I guess people just didn't want to watch the concert in a dark room on a big victim's screen.

905
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:57,484
Rym: You know what I think that is?

906
00:47:57,866 --> 00:47:58,910
Rym: Look at all of our panels.

907
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,480
Rym: What question did we ask to every panel before we started?

908
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,827
Rym: How many of you were at your first PAX ever?

909
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:07,180
Rym: It was more than three quarters of the room at every panel.

910
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:07,575
Scott: That was true.

911
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:11,320
Rym: I think the majority of the people at this PAX had never been to a PAX before.

912
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:14,360
Rym: And many of them had never been to a convention before.

913
00:48:15,261 --> 00:48:16,640
Rym: So that definitely skewed things.

914
00:48:17,124 --> 00:48:18,040
Scott: Not possibly, probably.

915
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,580
Rym: Because remember, when we went to our first PAX, those concerts were some of the greatest things I'd ever seen.

916
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,160
Rym: Yep.

917
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,259
Rym: Like, I just couldn't shut up about those concerts.

918
00:48:25,622 --> 00:48:27,676
Scott: In the immortal words of Big Mac,

919
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:28,179
Scott: "Yup.".

920
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:40,840
Rym: So, what I would do, because that overflow room is never going to fill, get rid of all the chairs in the back and put like three rows of tables and chairs so people can play games in there while they're watching.

921
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:41,719
Scott: That would be awesome.

922
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:46,800
Rym: Because there were a lot of people who thought they would play games in there and then they really just couldn't so they gave up.

923
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,820
Scott: Yeah, I do know some people who played games on the floor in there.

924
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:53,980
Scott: Yeah, but I think- But how awesome would it be to sit in tabletop and be able to watch the concerts?

925
00:48:54,242 --> 00:48:54,327
Scott: Yeah.

926
00:48:55,343 --> 00:48:56,005
Rym: And the main events.

927
00:48:56,206 --> 00:48:58,153
Rym: I mean, you know, the Omega-thon.

928
00:48:58,193 --> 00:49:00,140
Rym: I would have watched that Jenga in the overflow room.

929
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:01,000
Scott: Yeah, sure.

930
00:49:01,681 --> 00:49:04,339
Rym: Two, this is something we've suggested to every PAX.

931
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,079
Rym: PAX East now is the first time they've ever actually been in a position to do it.

932
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,159
Rym: PAX needs an art show.

933
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,840
Rym: Pretty much identical to Otakon's except all the auctions go to Child's Play.

934
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,220
Scott: Well, it doesn't need to be, you know, art show is good, but they definitely need an artist alley.

935
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,840
Scott: But it doesn't just have to be artist alley.

936
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,040
Rym: Well, I said art show because I think artist alley is kind of a separate thing.

937
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,017
Rym: They could do the art show independently of the BYOA.

938
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,460
Scott: Yeah, plus the art show shouldn't just be like art hanging on a wall.

939
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,331
Scott: It should just be a stuff show, right?

940
00:49:31,412 --> 00:49:32,720
Scott: Any craft whatsoever.

941
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,020
Rym: The social currency something.

942
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,480
Scott: Sell something you made for Child's Play show.

943
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:39,580
Scott: The thing is they already have a separate event.

944
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:43,159
Scott: The Child's Play charity dinner and auction, you know, which they do every year.

945
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,980
Scott: So I don't know if they're thinking that it would be redundant with that.

946
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,633
Rym: Ah, but see, the thing is at PAX.

947
00:49:47,673 --> 00:49:48,320
Rym: it'd be a different vibe.

948
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,160
Rym: If you do it, like imagine if they did it art show style, like the way Otakon does their art show.

949
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,919
Scott: And they do the bidding- Non-silent auction with non-silent auction at the end.

950
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,959
Rym: Yep, and also just the fact that people who want to show off their stuff would put things in.

951
00:50:00,561 --> 00:50:04,820
Rym: They don't care about, well they care about the charity, but really they just want to show off their art.

952
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,191
Rym: And PAX is about a webcomic.

953
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:09,698
Rym: A webcomic is art.

954
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,000
Rym: A lot of people who go to PAX are way into Gabe's art.

955
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,270
Rym: I think there's a huge artist overlap between video games and penny arcade fans.

956
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:22,380
Rym: that would make an art show at PAX bloody fucking brilliantly amazing.

957
00:50:22,801 --> 00:50:28,080
Scott: I mean the thing is, it's the penny arcade expo and there's a whole lot of gaming and not a whole lot of comics.

958
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,168
Scott: But penny arcade is a comic before it's a game.

959
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,100
Scott: And I think there just needs to be a lot more comic stuff.

960
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:40,660
Scott: And the people who go to PAX are looking, you know, these kinds of people are looking for more opportunities to show off their stuff, show what they can do.

961
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,866
Scott: And not just, you know, it's like.

962
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:47,500
Scott: the only people who get any play at PAX are the indie developers, basically us on up.

963
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:51,972
Scott: And the people who are us and below, they want a little table to show off.

964
00:50:52,012 --> 00:50:54,980
Scott: They want a little, you know, to be able to put up their art somewhere.

965
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,633
Scott: And not just in a cosplay, you know, sort of form.

966
00:50:57,674 --> 00:50:58,860
Scott: You know, maybe they make something else.

967
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,460
Scott: They want some sort of, you know, room or space at PAX to express themselves.

968
00:51:03,781 --> 00:51:07,600
Scott: And PAX definitely has plenty of room, at least at least, they can do it.

969
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:13,140
Rym: Now the other thing is, look at how much crowding there was in tabletop, in the expo hall, in all these other places.

970
00:51:13,562 --> 00:51:14,740
Rym: And yet there's all this empty space.

971
00:51:15,142 --> 00:51:17,880
Rym: If they just had an art, like take the Q room, cut it in half.

972
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,364
Rym: They don't need more than half.

973
00:51:19,605 --> 00:51:23,200
Rym: Turn the other half of that room into the show, the art show, whatever.

974
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:28,060
Scott: Yeah, cut the cafeteria in half, and then expand tabletop by that half, and then you're good.

975
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,340
Rym: And then make the other half of the cafeteria.

976
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,279
Scott: But also maybe the expo hall will get bigger too, you don't know.

977
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:33,680
Rym: Maybe.

978
00:51:33,821 --> 00:51:44,260
Rym: Well, or what they could do is, alright, so the Q room is half Q room, and then in the other half, that is half art show, half the BYOA hall.

979
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:53,800
Rym: Which is the, basically, like an artist alley, but it's the, you know, sub indie game developers and artists and people who just want to show stuff off or do weird stuff.

980
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,960
Rym: Like get a table, do whatever the hell you want, and maybe even no selling.

981
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,335
Scott: Yeah, bring your own awesome.

982
00:51:59,396 --> 00:51:59,660
Scott: Any awesome...

983
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,870
Rym: I kind of think no selling.

984
00:52:00,971 --> 00:52:01,960
Rym: It's just showing off.

985
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,600
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you want to sell something that you're going to profit, you should probably buy an expo hall table.

986
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,539
Rym: Ah, so I think the other thing they could do...

987
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:16,400
Scott: And the thing is, they have an indie alley in the expo hall, and I'm pretty sure, 99% sure, that those indie alley tables are less expensive than the other tables.

988
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,520
Scott: Because that guy who made that little target shooting game had an expo hall table in indie alley.

989
00:52:21,762 --> 00:52:25,900
Rym: So, I've already allocated basically all of what was the Q room into all this stuff.

990
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:37,380
Rym: If we turn the other room, the final room, into half like extra tabletop, the other half could be a dealer vending area separate, because the expo hall is mostly show off and demo.

991
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,440
Scott: So you want to take the, there are, you know, the expo hall does have vendors and also big showy booths.

992
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:43,760
Rym: I would separate vendors.

993
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:48,060
Scott: You want to separate the vendors into a vendor area that is separate from the showy booth area.

994
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:55,700
Rym: I don't know if it'd be a good idea, but I think it would really make people walk to the other side of the convention center and spread the crowd out a lot more.

995
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,820
Scott: Yeah, I don't really, you know, I don't know.

996
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,443
Rym: I don't know either.

997
00:52:58,483 --> 00:53:00,880
Rym: That's one of my like, huh, I wonder if that would work ideas.

998
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,440
Scott: There's a lot of issues with hours and things like that.

999
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,154
Rym: Also enforcers.

1000
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:13,060
Rym: But regardless of how they do it, and I think they should do it with the art show, the BYOA hall, which is basically the artist alley, but awesome.

1001
00:53:13,641 --> 00:53:17,840
Rym: And maybe the BYOA stage, the BYOP, bring your own panel.

1002
00:53:19,061 --> 00:53:24,540
Scott: Some other things I think they need to do is like the arcade was much better this year and it's still just the guys at Fun Spot.

1003
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:29,460
Rym: Scott, turn half of one of those big rooms into just a gigantic fucking arcade.

1004
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,179
Scott: I know, right?

1005
00:53:30,805 --> 00:53:31,300
Rym: Oh my God.

1006
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:36,079
Scott: Because it's still just Fun Spot bringing their stuff and, you know, their machines are quality, they work.

1007
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,140
Rym: Pax, Magfest has a bigger arcade than you.

1008
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:44,000
Scott: Yeah, they set up the room all fancy-like, you know, with the cool music and the atmosphere, but it's still a tiny room.

1009
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,900
Scott: You need to make a big ass arcade with all generations of games.

1010
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:50,480
Scott: Not just, you know, the centipede Atari generation.

1011
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,300
Scott: You gotta bring in the Street Fighter machines of, you know, two through four.

1012
00:53:55,581 --> 00:53:57,420
Scott: You gotta bring in the racing machines.

1013
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,980
Scott: You gotta bring in the rampart and the pinballs and the everything, you know.

1014
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:10,060
Scott: We need an arcade with the DDR and, you know, the Tycho Drum Master and Initial D and everything.

1015
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:21,120
Rym: But I think the end, if you take all this stuff, our main suggestion to Pax is that they've got, of their exhibit hall space, not counting panel rooms, they only actually used about half of it.

1016
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,999
Scott: Yeah, they had all this space, they did not use it.

1017
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:29,480
Scott: And I'm saying instead, you know, they could use the space more efficiently, which would mean get less space and just, you know.

1018
00:54:29,721 --> 00:54:29,999
Rym: Fuck that.

1019
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:35,339
Scott: But I'm saying you got all this space, you gotta get more stuff to cram it and, you know, fill it in.

1020
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:42,580
Scott: You know, if you got a pitcher that's half full, you could either use a mug instead of a pitcher or you could fill the pitcher with a lot more water.

1021
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:45,900
Rym: Well, we do know next year, I mean, this year was the first year in the new venue.

1022
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,100
Rym: You don't want to try anything weird with the first year when there's all these variables.

1023
00:54:50,682 --> 00:54:52,260
Rym: Next year, they've been in this venue before.

1024
00:54:53,141 --> 00:54:55,100
Rym: I think it's the time to experiment.

1025
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,279
Scott: They just gotta get more enforcers.

1026
00:54:56,821 --> 00:54:58,460
Scott: So if you're thinking about it, enforce.

1027
00:54:58,841 --> 00:54:59,743
Scott: Yeah.

1028
00:54:59,823 --> 00:55:07,980
Rym: In fact, if they want more enforcers than they had last year, and any of you listeners out there want to enforce, we can introduce you to people you can talk to.

1029
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,076
Scott: Yeah, I know a lot of people are like, you know, they don't come to PAX because of money reasons.

1030
00:55:12,116 --> 00:55:12,920
Scott: Well, enforce then.

1031
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:13,422
Scott: Yeah.

1032
00:55:13,804 --> 00:55:16,340
Rym: Also, most of the enforcers we know have a really good time enforcing.

1033
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:16,880
Scott: Yep.

1034
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,687
Rym: And last, last, last idea.

1035
00:55:19,707 --> 00:55:23,380
Rym: I don't like to bring this up on the show.

1036
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:31,220
Rym: As much as I love talking about myself, pretty much half the enforcers we talked to in panel rooms and everything basically said that we ran the best panels they had all day.

1037
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,046
Scott: That's what they say.

1038
00:55:32,087 --> 00:55:32,410
Scott: I don't know.

1039
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:33,299
Scott: I can't believe that that's true.

1040
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,021
Rym: Now, here's the thing.

1041
00:55:34,141 --> 00:55:44,380
Rym: If that is true, that is fucked up because I think we're pretty good, but PAX has a right to much better content being its best content in the panel rooms than us.

1042
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:44,849
Rym: Oh, yes.

1043
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:50,787
Rym: So I think what PAX need to do is steal a line from MAGFest.

1044
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:53,430
Rym: MAGFest has the MAG-9, nine gaming intellectuals.

1045
00:55:53,450 --> 00:56:02,580
Rym: They get nine people who know a lot about games and they put them on panels with a real moderator who has a real agenda and actually leads the discussion.

1046
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:10,780
Rym: Because if you look at most panels of PAX, they're either a community panel that only applies to people in that community and is completely just meaningless to everyone else.

1047
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:16,111
Scott: Are you a listener or viewer of X internet show or podcast or video thing?

1048
00:56:16,392 --> 00:56:19,899
Scott: Then come to this panel and all those people, the fans and the creators will be there.

1049
00:56:19,939 --> 00:56:20,240
Scott: Hooray.

1050
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,287
Rym: Every year they're like, "Guys, do the GeekNights

1051
00:56:22,308 --> 00:56:22,569
Rym: panel.".

1052
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:23,272
Rym: We're like, "No, that's

1053
00:56:23,312 --> 00:56:23,693
Rym: stupid.".

1054
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:25,320
Rym: We should do the PAX panel.

1055
00:56:27,261 --> 00:56:31,208
Rym: So the rest of the panels are not lectures, they're panels.

1056
00:56:31,569 --> 00:56:36,438
Rym: But they're usually either the same panels as last year, meaning the same four game.

1057
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:40,976
Scott: journalists get up and- They did that thing where it's like, "Vote on the top 10

1058
00:56:40,976 --> 00:56:41,418
Scott: games.".

1059
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,185
Rym: But it's the same people and they have the same things to say.

1060
00:56:44,265 --> 00:56:45,146
Rym: They don't have an agenda.

1061
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:52,240
Rym: And almost all of them just open it up to questions from the audience right away, which is pretty much a guaranteed recipe for a lame panel.

1062
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,467
Scott: Also, don't forget the company selling something panel.

1063
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:58,332
Scott: "Hey, we're id Software.

1064
00:56:58,392 --> 00:56:59,635
Scott: Check out Rage.

1065
00:56:59,695 --> 00:57:00,417
Scott: It's coming out.

1066
00:57:00,938 --> 00:57:01,660
Scott: We're going to show it to

1067
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:01,780
Scott: you.".

1068
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:08,020
Rym: Now those panels actually often fill up and actually that's a good use of panel space because that's a way people are interested in it.

1069
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:09,319
Scott: I kind of wanted to go to that.

1070
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,604
Rym: I only didn't because the Rage panel was full.

1071
00:57:12,606 --> 00:57:18,980
Rym: But I guess if Magfest, with its level of professionalism, I love you Magfest, but yeah.

1072
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:29,840
Rym: If you can pull off professional, moderated panels with experts in games and game theory that everyone who's in that room finds really awesome, PAX can do the same.

1073
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:32,319
Rym: PAX needs you to steal that formula straight up.

1074
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,183
Scott: Yep.

1075
00:57:34,223 --> 00:57:39,392
Scott: If you can't get people to fill the panel rooms with stuff that people like, you need to go out and solicit it.

1076
00:57:39,432 --> 00:57:42,858
Scott: Go find people and say, "Hey, you would do an awesome panel at PAX.

1077
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:43,379
Scott: Come and do

1078
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:43,599
Scott: one.".

1079
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:44,324
Scott: You know?

1080
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:45,440
Scott: Whatever.

1081
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:45,961
Rym: Yep.

1082
00:57:46,284 --> 00:57:48,240
Rym: Otherwise, we'll see you at the next PAX.

1083
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:48,723
Rym: Wait.

1084
00:57:48,846 --> 00:57:49,360
Scott: One more thing.

1085
00:57:49,982 --> 00:57:51,380
Scott: Stop lying about the attendance.

1086
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,102
Rym: Alright, PAX.

1087
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,308
Rym: I'm warning you.

1088
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:55,820
Rym: We're going to have to call you out at Prime.

1089
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:04,917
Scott: Yeah, it's not gonna, it's like, I was gonna call it out at the Q&A, which is an inappropriate place to do it, because it's like, it's not, Gabe and Tycho, they have nothing to do with that.

1090
00:58:04,997 --> 00:58:06,360
Scott: They don't know or care, even.

1091
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:13,580
Scott: But it's like, there's no other soapbox you can get, I can get on to bring this issue to the required amount of light.

1092
00:58:13,801 --> 00:58:15,149
Scott: And it isn't just PAX.

1093
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,780
Scott: I would be very clear about that.

1094
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:21,307
Rym: But we know why they do it, because basically, not doing it this way is the anomaly.

1095
00:58:21,508 --> 00:58:28,980
Rym: Only fan, super unprofessional conventions do it the right way, which is, number of people in the building.

1096
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:39,200
Rym: But PAX, and the New York Comic Con, the New York Anime Festival, the San Diego Comic Con, and surprisingly, most of the anime cons on the west coast do it this way, too.

1097
00:58:40,981 --> 00:58:42,428
Rym: They're like, yeah, we're bigger than Otakon.

1098
00:58:42,468 --> 00:58:43,010
Rym: No, fuck you.

1099
00:58:43,091 --> 00:58:45,120
Rym: Otakon is so much bigger than you, it's laughable.

1100
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,820
Scott: Otakon is probably bigger than PAX East, and PAX East is bigger than PAX West.

1101
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:56,980
Rym: Otakon is bigger than PAX East, because Otakon's attendance is about 27,000 bodies, and the BCE can only- And that's not counting staff or anything.

1102
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,505
Rym: The BCE, actually that is.

1103
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:00,712
Rym: The BCE only holds 24,000 people at once.

1104
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:10,399
Rym: And the total attendance of PAX East was, I do know the number, I won't say it because it was given to me in confidence, less than that.

1105
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:11,865
Rym: So.

1106
00:59:12,308 --> 00:59:12,652
Scott: So.

1107
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:13,156
Scott: So.

1108
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:13,519
Scott: So.

1109
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:23,822
Rym: I mean, if PAX is gonna say, you know, 24,000 people, then I can legitimately say that ConnectiCon, this dinky con that we're in charge of panels for- Is 21,000.

1110
00:59:23,822 --> 00:59:26,980
Rym: Eh, 20,000, because we don't get that many three day badges.

1111
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,663
Scott: That's true.

1112
00:59:27,703 --> 00:59:28,809
Rym: So, you know, 18 to 20,000 is our convention.

1113
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:28,970
Rym: Yeah.

1114
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,003
Scott: Yeah.

1115
00:59:32,345 --> 00:59:36,660
Scott: So, this is a pet peeve of mine, and I'm going to bring it to light if it is not rectified.

1116
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,700
Scott: 'Cause it just needs to be known mostly by the journalists who keep reporting the number without understanding it.

1117
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:41,980
Rym: Yep.

1118
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:51,100
Rym: I feel like we need to make a tweet account, like one of those apps, that looks for anyone quoting attendance numbers of any convention, and if it's on the list of cons that do turnstile, it corrects them and tweets out.

1119
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,940
Rym: Kinda like that Blood Elf account that yells at you for swearing all the time.

1120
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:55,505
Scott: Really?

1121
00:59:55,546 --> 00:59:56,079
Scott: I never see that.

1122
00:59:56,281 --> 00:59:57,820
Rym: I saw it once and I banned it, but anyway.

1123
00:59:57,981 --> 01:00:01,275
Scott: I get an annoying Navi, and I also get, "I'll buy that for a

1124
01:00:01,315 --> 01:00:01,617
Scott: dollar."

1125
01:00:01,637 --> 01:00:02,360
Scott: All the time.

1126
01:00:03,342 --> 01:00:04,427
Scott: If you say Zelda, it goes, "Hey,

1127
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:04,769
Scott: listen.".

1128
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,998
Scott: And if you say Robocop, it says, "I'll buy that for a

1129
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:07,279
Scott: dollar.".

1130
01:00:07,501 --> 01:00:09,099
Rym: I follow Duke Togo, though.

1131
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:09,960
Rym: Dot dot dot.

1132
01:00:17,182 --> 01:00:19,320
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1133
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,460
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1134
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,860
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1135
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:32,800
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1136
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:37,560
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1137
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,056
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1138
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:45,360
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1139
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,480
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
