1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,505
Scott: It's Thursday May 11th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:14,769
Scott: We're gonna finish talking about e3.

3
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:18,047
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:24,604
Scott: So the results are in on whether our podcast should have been three hours or not.

5
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:26,790
Rym: yep, and almost no one voted.

6
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:28,443
Scott: What are you talking about?

7
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:29,008
Scott: there were like?

8
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:30,633
Scott: 20 years.

9
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:34,284
Scott: so people in the forum saying yay make it as long as you want.

10
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:36,470
Scott: the only person who said don't make it long.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,808
Scott: With someone who emailed us absolutely every other person who responded of which there were many said make the podcast longer.

12
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:44,028
Scott: longer is better All right.

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,915
Rym: Then if we pay for more lips and we can do that we could have done it without more lips And you know it now.

14
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:49,097
Rym: cuz.

15
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:50,627
Rym: then we would have to post a lot more episodes.

16
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:51,090
Rym: on the hosting.

17
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,517
Scott: Yeah, we've been fine.

18
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:56,720
Rym: We're on the edge of the hood on the lips and as it is now We're all right.

19
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:58,193
Scott: now We're not anyway.

20
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:05,714
Scott: someone also asked what the longest podcast ever is and I'm not quite sure There wasn't something.

21
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:08,825
Scott: I tried like for 15 minutes to google it and I couldn't find it.

22
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:19,350
Scott: however someone in our forums Linked to a couple podcasts that are on average pretty long and the longest one I saw was the bib and yaz podcast.

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:26,648
Scott: I have no idea what this podcast is about but it I think I saw an episode that was like two hours and change or almost three hours.

24
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:34,283
Scott: Yeah maybe we can find out what the longest podcast ever was or is and Beat it just once.

25
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:35,170
Rym: that's real easy.

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:42,192
Rym: All I have to do is use my little random tone generator and generate random tones that are one second longer than whatever that is And put it up.

27
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:46,044
Scott: Yeah, the thing is you know that counts in a semantic argument.

28
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,753
Rym: Yeah, it's also real compressible Mp3 wise.

29
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:56,249
Scott: yeah, however if you the Guinness Book of World Records doesn't let you get away with stuff like the Guinness Book of World Records Is barely researched bullshit?

30
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,716
Scott: Well, it's not about research.

31
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:00,162
Scott: It's about you know.

32
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:01,287
Rym: It's about worlds.

33
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:02,110
Rym: blankie is blank.

34
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,855
Rym: It's not anything that it is.

35
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:04,376
Scott: they put in.

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:15,490
Scott: the world's blankie is blank and then if you think you got more blankiness then You go, and you put up a challenge, and they have rules for each blank in his blank, and then you try to beat it.

37
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:16,830
Scott: It's like an ongoing contest.

38
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,292
Rym: I know.

39
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:22,310
Rym: I just remember when I was a kid that the Guinness Book of World Records was really the lowbrow entertainment.

40
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:24,219
Scott: Oh, it was very lowbrow.

41
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,450
Rym: I remember when they banned white lowbrow.

42
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:35,965
Rym: They banned a long time ago all of the body Related ones because people were hurting themselves trying to set records like ate the most broken glass.

43
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,710
Rym: Oh, yeah, our fattest.

44
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:42,549
Rym: Oh, yeah, I think early Bay currently has the fattest title.

45
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:48,436
Scott: Okay So maybe one day.

46
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:49,419
Scott: We'll make a long one.

47
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,890
Scott: I don't care, but Rym seems to be anti long podcast.

48
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,510
Rym: Yeah, I just generally don't think it's a good idea.

49
00:02:55,571 --> 00:03:01,330
Rym: I mean I know if I were listening I'd probably just stop listening after an hour or so, but I don't have time to listen to podcasts anyway.

50
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:09,434
Scott: Yeah, well I think the idea is that since it's a podcast not a radio show that people will pause it on their iPod and then Continue later,

51
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:15,499
Rym: but by the same token by spreading it out into two hour and a half podcasts It saves us some effort down the road.

52
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,450
Scott: I guess theoretically.

53
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:22,150
Rym: But for all they know we did record the whole thing that night, and we just split it up.

54
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:26,630
Scott: Yeah, no he didn't know we did, but I just want to say that you know.

55
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:36,665
Scott: uh While I don't care if we actually do long podcasts or not If you really wanted long podcasts, and you're not getting them direct all your blame to Rym.

56
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:39,252
Scott: yep yell at me yellow Rym Scott That's me.

57
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:41,398
Scott: Oh no problem with the long podcast.

58
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:41,779
Scott: I'm with you.

59
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:44,106
Rym: Yeah, so if there's any problems yell at Rym.

60
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:53,106
Scott: Yeah People know which one of us is which right because other podcasts introduce themselves and everyone seems to.

61
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,730
Rym: anytime there's been an argument.

62
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:59,810
Rym: It's like they can equate the way we speak and the things we say on the show with the things we say in the forum.

63
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:02,049
Scott: Yeah, it seems like they can do that.

64
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,070
Rym: But of course the guy who was trying to guess what we look like based on our voices thought I was Hispanic.

65
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:08,678
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why I thought that.

66
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:16,500
Scott: yeah, we are clearly not Hispanic Very very not Hispanic although we like Hispanics.

67
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:17,183
Scott: Hispanics are cool.

68
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,668
Scott: Yeah, but we are not them.

69
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:24,349
Rym: So news time yeah in the news now, I got some non e3 news.

70
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:33,870
Scott: here I also have non e3 news because well there wasn't so much because like we're gonna cover all This stuff that was e3 news is part of the main bit.

71
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:39,506
Scott: So the only real e3 news we can cover is like the side news, and there wasn't so much of it.

72
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:44,509
Scott: at least it wasn't Prominent enough at this time for us to find it.

73
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:56,828
Scott: See that like yeah next week all the news from all the tiny booths around e3 from the independent game developers is Gonna start crawling up as the Sony Nintendo Microsoft news is complete.

74
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:57,852
Rym: of course It was also.

75
00:04:57,892 --> 00:05:03,190
Rym: there's a lot of news that is interesting, but really isn't worth getting a billing as a news bit.

76
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:05,300
Scott: Oh clearly, that's like every day.

77
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,510
Rym: Paris Hilton was there with her stupid game.

78
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:10,179
Scott: Yeah, Adam West was giving signatures.

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,324
Rym: Adam West is awesome.

80
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:12,730
Scott: Yeah, that's not a news bit.

81
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,337
Rym: We could do a whole show on Adam West.

82
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:14,919
Scott: Oh my god.

83
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:15,682
Scott: That'd be scary.

84
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:18,293
Scott: I Have to show you that.

85
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:22,189
Scott: remind me to show you an animated gif from old Batman after the show, okay?

86
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:29,147
Rym: But anyway, my news is something that happened and started a long time ago, but it finally ended.

87
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,070
Rym: so that's the news.

88
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:33,141
Rym: There is going to be no dot xxx domain.

89
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:35,629
Rym: I can voted it down completely.

90
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:38,697
Rym: I say it's great news.

91
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:43,279
Scott: Well, see I didn't really care about you know, the Existence of the domain itself.

92
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,357
Rym: I mean it's our hair from a technical standpoint Not even from a porn standpoint.

93
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,450
Scott: as far as I'm concerned at the more top-level domains the better.

94
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:55,428
Rym: No, the more top-level domains the more convoluted broken and stupid DNS becomes.

95
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,730
Scott: Yeah Well that makes it more and more likely we should get some IPv6 in the house.

96
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,857
Rym: That doesn't have anything to do with DNS.

97
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:04,485
Scott: I thought that IPv6 had a newer better DNS to hide it.

98
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:04,906
Scott: What?

99
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:08,407
Rym: no no DNS is completely independent of IPv6.

100
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:11,542
Rym: There are different layers and everything have nothing to do with.

101
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:17,690
Scott: I know they don't have anything to do with each other But I figured that when they switch to IPv6, oh switch DNS to something newer better.

102
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:24,390
Rym: No, because even if they quote-unquote switch to IPv6, that's not something that would happen immediately.

103
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,615
Rym: It would be a long slow.

104
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,198
Scott: I know that.

105
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:28,930
Rym: I know that you can't just have a long slow change of something.

106
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,874
Scott: Well, you know we need to do.

107
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:33,789
Scott: we need to go check for RFCs for stuff like DNS 2.0.

108
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:34,170
Rym: You know what?

109
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,934
Rym: There's really nothing.

110
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,481
Rym: DNS is fine.

111
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:38,168
Scott: There's no way to make that better.

112
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:44,790
Rym: There are ways to make it better But the ways to make it better in would have other negative side effects.

113
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,646
Rym: They suck or would be difficult to implement or a lot of people will just say fuck you.

114
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,269
Rym: We're not changing.

115
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,599
Rym: DNS isn't really broken or anything.

116
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,442
Rym: It works fine.

117
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:55,210
Rym: The only people who complain about it now.

118
00:06:55,692 --> 00:07:03,709
Rym: This is gonna be interesting because I've noticed something about people who are first or second year IT students Because they post a lot on slash out about this.

119
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,596
Rym: They always whenever DNS comes up.

120
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:10,970
Rym: They always say DNS is horrible and stupid and broken and it's gonna die.

121
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,317
Rym: Anyway, it's honest last legs.

122
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:13,080
Rym: We need to get rid of it.

123
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,790
Rym: We need something better and I've noticed that most of the reasons they give for it being broken are really just them not understanding how DNS works.

124
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:23,410
Scott: That happens with anything.

125
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:35,030
Rym: Well, it seems that because DNS if you don't know how to come out of set it up and you're a you know Freshman in IT and you're building a DNS server It's kind of painful because you don't know the syntax of the text file you have to write.

126
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:41,135
Rym: But once you learn the syntax of the text file and then you know why it's that way and why everything is the way it Is you go?

127
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:42,321
Rym: Oh, all right.

128
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,769
Rym: This is actually pretty good.

129
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:45,755
Rym: It works fairly well.

130
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:47,482
Scott: Yeah, DNS works.

131
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:55,850
Scott: Okay, but you know as As with any computer geek, even if you have something that works just fine You're always looking for something that works better and awesomer.

132
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:59,803
Rym: That's very much the difference between IT and CS on a very high level.

133
00:07:59,843 --> 00:08:02,050
Rym: broad fundamental planning perspective.

134
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:07,390
Scott: Yeah, this Linux kernel is okay, but I need something else.

135
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:14,965
Rym: pirate kernel universe Yeah, but like I I do IT for a living.

136
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:16,633
Rym: like Scott is CS I am IT.

137
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:19,590
Rym: We're both computer guys, but don't think that we do the same thing.

138
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:21,966
Rym: We really can't do what either of us does.

139
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:25,678
Scott: very well Like I know more about his stuff than he knows about my.

140
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:28,327
Rym: yeah, you have proven that wrong a couple times.

141
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,373
Scott: I know plenty about IT stuff.

142
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:33,542
Scott: Yeah, I'm not like the master.

143
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,510
Rym: you couldn't even get an NTP server working.

144
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:36,272
Scott: I could.

145
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:37,998
Scott: I got it working just fine.

146
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:39,985
Rym: It didn't work and you complained about it.

147
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:41,429
Scott: I knew how to do NTP.

148
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,160
Scott: I just didn't know how to do super NTP.

149
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,167
Rym: You didn't know how to do NTP.

150
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:44,630
Rym: that works.

151
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,730
Scott: You know, that's the thing is that I know how to do the basic normal level of everything.

152
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:54,358
Scott: You know how to do but just not the really good level of you know Super you don't know how to do anything that I.

153
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:55,242
Rym: what do you mean super?

154
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:56,990
Rym: you couldn't make an NTP server go.

155
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,557
Scott: I can make an NTP server go.

156
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:00,305
Scott: I just can't make it go the way I want.

157
00:09:00,445 --> 00:09:01,329
Rym: How did you want it to go?

158
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,662
Scott: I wanted it to Serve the time.

159
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:12,010
Scott: I Wanted it to serve the time to other computers and also get the time from a different computer.

160
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,517
Rym: That's like the simplest.

161
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:15,044
Rym: that's all NTP does.

162
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:16,190
Rym: that's the most basic.

163
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,561
Rym: That is a three line configuration file.

164
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:20,450
Rym: four lines if you want to be fancy.

165
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,839
Scott: But I also wanted to have.

166
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:26,683
Scott: I wanted to have like security things So other people couldn't get the time and no one could change the time.

167
00:09:26,703 --> 00:09:27,125
Rym: You know what?

168
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,269
Rym: five lines.

169
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,317
Scott: Yeah, well, I put those lines in.

170
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:31,220
Scott: I copied them from the internet.

171
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,910
Rym: It didn't work cuz you probably copied the wrong lines.

172
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:35,115
Scott: Yeah, we'll see.

173
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:37,990
Scott: I can make a computer get the time just fine.

174
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:49,430
Rym: Anyway anyway, I The work I do is generally along the lines of make something that works and maintain it maintain uptime.

175
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,195
Rym: Nothing should ever go down.

176
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:53,400
Rym: don't upgrade something unless you have to.

177
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,827
Rym: the network never ever ever goes down.

178
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:59,758
Rym: if it goes down you Make it come back up immediately and the work.

179
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:01,082
Scott: I do is computers.

180
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:09,364
Scott: Don't already do X. They could do X Technologically speaking, but they don't do X. make them do X. make them do X better.

181
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:10,988
Scott: make them do X even better.

182
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:12,313
Scott: all right now There's a problem.

183
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,538
Scott: They're not doing X perfectly.

184
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:14,803
Scott: make it do it perfectly now.

185
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:15,928
Scott: make it do it better now.

186
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:27,460
Rym: these two Come into conflict in such situations as Rym wants the hosting to be up right now Scott wants to put a new kernel on it The kernel on the hosting.

187
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:31,450
Scott: I don't go that far, but yeah You know I'll make something and it'll work well.

188
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:36,090
Scott: And then Rym will have to be in charge of making sure it continues to work well.

189
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:39,404
Scott: And then I'll say all right I made a thing to make it work faster.

190
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:42,983
Scott: and Rym says Does that mean we need to turn it off and then turn it on again?

191
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,490
Scott: and Scott says yes, and I go?

192
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:50,587
Scott: Oh my god, and I say all right when it comes back up.

193
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:51,269
Scott: It will be faster.

194
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,169
Scott: Everyone who's sitting around while it's off can suck my dick.

195
00:10:56,314 --> 00:11:00,061
Scott: Anyway Skip this shit, so we can get to the e3 business.

196
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:00,483
Scott: all right.

197
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,090
Rym: There's gonna be no xxx domain.

198
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:04,890
Rym: I think that's great because it was a stupid idea.

199
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,988
Scott: I think it was a good idea, but that a law to make people use it was a bad idea.

200
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,915
Rym: Mostly well the problem.

201
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:16,814
Rym: It's stupid to have that as a top-level domain because now you're making a domain That's based on the content.

202
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:24,218
Rym: a top-level domain based on the content of the sites as opposed to the Identities of the people who create the sites.

203
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:25,361
Scott: it's all right.

204
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:28,270
Scott: so xxx domain shouldn't be for porn sites.

205
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:31,585
Scott: It should be for people who are pornographers to make sites.

206
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:32,770
Rym: no because that already exists.

207
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,632
Rym: It's calm.

208
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:38,105
Scott: anything commercial was calm, so why don't they have dot xxx?

209
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:38,988
Rym: calm you can do that.

210
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:40,616
Rym: Yeah, that's good Anyone can do that.

211
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:42,509
Rym: Yeah, anyone could just buy dot xxx.

212
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:46,390
Scott: That's the thing is that you know we need one in between there.

213
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:50,785
Scott: So you could buy Joe dot xxx calm and then Rym dot xxx.

214
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,190
Rym: DNS was originally that way.

215
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:53,280
Scott: I know it was.

216
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,370
Scott: it's not that way anymore.

217
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:54,591
Scott: The

218
00:11:54,671 --> 00:12:10,959
Rym: only reason it's not that way is because people got greedy and mostly because idiots who didn't understand DNS were in charge of companies making decisions about it and as a result They said why can't I just name things whatever I want not understanding the technical limitations and the reasons Why things were the way they were?

219
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:12,290
Rym: hmm, but anyway?

220
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:16,450
Rym: There's an unintended consequence of this dot xxx decision.

221
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:30,049
Rym: now for some reason and mostly Fundamentalist Christians and anti-porn crusaders were advocates of this because then they wanted laws that would force quote-unquote Pornography to be under this domain.

222
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:31,655
Rym: That was their goal.

223
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:35,890
Rym: that way they could censor it and they wanted to screw anyone who tried to put porn elsewhere.

224
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:39,929
Rym: I'm not gonna argue about the definition of porn because I think we all agree.

225
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:49,450
Rym: Anyway a lot of other Fundamentalist anti-porn people were against dot xxx because it legitimizes porn.

226
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:55,590
Rym: That group was actually stronger in the US and the main reason that the u.s.

227
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,488
Rym: Was against the dot xxx domain was because of the fundamentalists who were against porn.

228
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:03,475
Rym: ICANN is an international body.

229
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:09,250
Rym: the rest of the world saw ICANN's vetoing xxx as the u.s.

230
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:13,730
Rym: pseudo Christian fundamentalist crazies trying to exert control over the Internet.

231
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:21,570
Rym: And there's a lot of rumbling going on in Europe about this Even though ICANN probably made the decision for reasons that have nothing to do with America.

232
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,670
Scott: Yep People need to know about technology.

233
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:33,639
Scott: There should be some sort of universal law where if you don't know about something you are Thereby prevented from making any decision about it.

234
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:39,330
Scott: if you don't know about fires You cannot be the boss of the firemen.

235
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:41,299
Scott: Yeah That is should be the law.

236
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:47,930
Scott: if you don't know anything about guns You should not be able to do anything that has to do with any gun legislation or anything.

237
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:49,582
Scott: That's the way it should be.

238
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:53,719
Scott: if you don't know about technology You have no say when it comes to a technological matter.

239
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,758
Scott: now you can argue about which matter requires which you know Field of knowledge.

240
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,173
Scott: I don't care about that, but Right.

241
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,250
Rym: I got this great idealistic idea, but I don't care about the details or the actual implementation.

242
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,133
Scott: No, I don't care.

243
00:14:07,153 --> 00:14:07,655
Scott: That doesn't matter.

244
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:09,421
Scott: It's just the specific examples.

245
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:09,843
Scott: I don't care.

246
00:14:09,863 --> 00:14:10,826
Rym: I shake Rivera.

247
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:16,630
Scott: Yeah, whatever The point is if you don't know about something you shouldn't be able to say anything about it because you don't know nothing about.

248
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,642
Rym: No, you're allowed to say I don't know anything about that.

249
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:19,890
Scott: That's the only thing you're allowed to say.

250
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,688
Rym: Oh, you're also allowed to say will you tell teach me about it?

251
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:24,659
Scott: No, you're not allowed to say that.

252
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:25,324
Scott: why not?

253
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:26,130
Scott: because I won't teach you.

254
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:29,997
Scott: Learn on your own from a book.

255
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:35,130
Rym: Let's get to your news because I'm actually this is something I know a lot about and I'm pissed off about.

256
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:37,602
Rym: Alright, so I believe this is in the news again.

257
00:14:37,622 --> 00:14:39,712
Rym: This was killed a long time ago Okay.

258
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:43,350
Scott: So anyway, the cover of Time magazine says something about autism.

259
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:45,596
Scott: So I had seen this.

260
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:49,006
Scott: actually, you know, how often does Scott see the cover of Time magazine?

261
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:50,410
Scott: who reads no magazines and watches?

262
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,132
Scott: No TV.

263
00:14:51,152 --> 00:14:55,485
Scott: Yeah, but I happen to see it actually randomly, but I paid it no heed.

264
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:56,187
Scott: I didn't really care.

265
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,950
Scott: Whatever.

266
00:14:58,193 --> 00:15:03,150
Scott: so then I'm listening to the Pendulette podcast today, which is awesome, which is awesome.

267
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:12,587
Scott: It's actually a radio show that's an hour long, but they podcast it which is cool And he gets a Randy on the phone and I'm like, woohoo James Randy's on the phone.

268
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:12,869
Scott: What up?

269
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:19,110
Scott: And they start talking about this autism and I'm like, alright, what are they gonna say about autism?

270
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,430
Scott: It's probably some magic hokey autism treatment, right?

271
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,358
Scott: No, not some magic hokey autism treatment.

272
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:28,830
Scott: all those those do exist and you shouldn't pay them any heed.

273
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:46,903
Scott: Apparently the cover story that is extremely long and prominent in the latest issue of Time magazine is very very supportive of something called Facilitated communication and there is a facilitated communication Institute at Syracuse University.

274
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:54,263
Scott: now, let me tell you what this is Because I see Rym like inhaling I'm just.

275
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:57,610
Rym: all I'm gonna say is one word Bullshit, yeah, okay.

276
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:05,997
Scott: So you might know that autism is I guess a disorder that can vary in degree Depending on who you are.

277
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:16,027
Scott: You can be slightly autistic which is called high High functioning high functioning autism, which means you're kind of like a normal person.

278
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,769
Scott: only you're a little weird You know because you're a little bit autistic.

279
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:25,610
Scott: So which means you can live a pretty much normal life, but people who meet you might go Hey, that guy's a little weird because he's a little bit autistic.

280
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:34,374
Scott: Or you can be low functioning autistic, which means you're super autistic and you're basically just.

281
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:41,614
Scott: I Don't want to insult anyone who is low functioning autistic, but you're really just like a gibbering Nothing.

282
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:51,320
Scott: I like, you know, I really I'm not trying to be a fan, you know, usually I'm trying to be offensive I'm really not trying to be offensive, but that's you can't communicate.

283
00:16:51,561 --> 00:17:01,848
Scott: You can't read or write you can't do anything you can make noises and flail around and You just you're really not almost non-sentient.

284
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:08,442
Rym: now There's Asperger's which is similar to autism But it's generally separate and there's still a lot of research going on.

285
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,990
Rym: autism and Asperger's aren't very well understood yet.

286
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,712
Scott: Yeah, they're not.

287
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:20,029
Scott: this is something that can be figured out by science and because it hasn't been figured out by science There's a lot of Randy going on now.

288
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:30,837
Scott: the main problem with High functioning autistic kids is that you know, they have trouble in school because they're a little weird and We can do a lot about that.

289
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:32,323
Scott: That doesn't even require science.

290
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:37,060
Rym: Yeah, though kids in mind at this point There's there are a lot of misconceptions about autism out there.

291
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,368
Rym: They're sure mainly coming from the movie Rain Man.

292
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,285
Rym: Yeah Autistic does not mean super genius who just is weird.

293
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,750
Scott: No, it does not there.

294
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,370
Rym: I mean there are a few cases of people who have abilities like that.

295
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:52,785
Rym: They're few and far between and most autistic people are not secret geniuses.

296
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:53,790
Rym: that is correct.

297
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:54,978
Rym: If you think they are you're.

298
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,869
Rym: it's sad, but you're just deluding yourself.

299
00:17:57,613 --> 00:18:06,445
Rym: Kind of like the Shivo situation where oh look, she's following the balloon She's there and then they autopsied and there wasn't even an ocular cortex or a brain or anything.

300
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:06,987
Scott: Yep.

301
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:08,050
Scott: There's just nothing.

302
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,686
Scott: So The problem with low functioning autistic people is that you can't communicate with them whatsoever.

303
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:27,793
Scott: They're just basically Completely void of any human exist like, you know thinking human existence that other people can You know detect.

304
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:29,419
Rym: yeah, I mean there's brain activity.

305
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,664
Rym: They're they're thinking.

306
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:32,470
Rym: Yeah, they're they exist in their brain.

307
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,478
Rym: We don't know how they exist, but they're there.

308
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:35,200
Rym: It's possible.

309
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:36,626
Scott: They don't know what they're thinking.

310
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:37,710
Scott: We don't know what they're doing.

311
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:42,210
Scott: We don't you know, all we know is they're making a noise They're moving around.

312
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:45,784
Rym: It's you know, yeah, I mean they're people and something's going on.

313
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:48,580
Scott: I can't read they can't write They can't do anything.

314
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,156
Rym: Well, here comes Facilitated communication, right?

315
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:58,335
Scott: So if you're imagine being a parent of a low-functioning autistic child You're pretty much.

316
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:01,910
Scott: your greatest wish in the world is to communicate with this child in any way whatsoever.

317
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,317
Scott: Facilitated communication Institute at Syracuse University.

318
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:07,339
Scott: what they do there is.

319
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:10,887
Scott: Let me let me just write.

320
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:21,983
Scott: Let me read this little paragraph here with Chadwick helping to stabilize her right wrist and her mother watching a girl thought to be Incapable of learning to read or write slowly typed.

321
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:23,430
Scott: I love mom.

322
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:33,390
Scott: With Chadwick helping to stabilize her right wrist I'm doing the exact same thing Penn Jillette did with Chadwick helping to stabilize her right wrist.

323
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:56,177
Scott: People are taking their heavily heavily autistic children to this Institute where other Completely normal people are holding the autistic child by the hand moving their hand around on a keyboard and Basically, it's like if I grabbed rims hand and I took his index finger and I pushed it down on the keyboard and make him Type Rym is gay.

324
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,869
Rym: You know what if this were Penn & Teller's bullshit?

325
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:08,826
Rym: right now I can just picture like us doing that sort of bit or them doing that bit where it's spelling out bullshit Yeah, and then the typewriter comes up ding and then he holds it up and then they do their next bit.

326
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,438
Scott: now Here's where it gets worse.

327
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:25,170
Scott: If you think that somehow these facilitators are actually not typing for the children and that The they're just holding the child's hand in place so that the child can you know type as they want.

328
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:27,597
Scott: here is something Randy did.

329
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:38,449
Scott: Randy went and he had the facilitator leave the room and He went to the child and he said, you know, basically Truck truck type truck.

330
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,443
Scott: I don't know if truck is the word but might have been house who knows.

331
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,090
Scott: and he showed a picture of it.

332
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,580
Scott: He's like truck truck truck truck truck truck truck, you know.

333
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,415
Scott: Then he brings the facilitator back in the room.

334
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:50,220
Scott: And what is the kid type?

335
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:53,327
Scott: not truck type something else not truck.

336
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:58,509
Scott: then The kid type something really really quickly.

337
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,973
Scott: That's like this man.

338
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:01,096
Scott: He's making me very angry.

339
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,539
Scott: He needs to leave bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla.

340
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,094
Scott: Huh Right now here's an even worse one.

341
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:06,719
Scott: Are you ready?

342
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,278
Scott: So someone else not Randy did a study.

343
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:18,423
Scott: now There have been 45 studies and all of them has come to the same result and the same result is the facilitators are doing the typing Not the kids.

344
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:20,190
Scott: the kids cannot communicate with anyone.

345
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:26,189
Rym: Yeah, there's really no question as to whether or not 45 Perfect scientific studies ready for this study.

346
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:29,420
Scott: This is the like the study that is absolutely convincing to everyone.

347
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:36,100
Scott: Someone went in and they would show a picture like a really like a children's picture to the facilitator.

348
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,700
Scott: Then the facilitator believed that you know, the same picture was being shown to the child, but they switched the picture up.

349
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,420
Scott: So they'd show a house to the facilitator and then they show a truck to the kid.

350
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:52,659
Scott: then they would have the facilitator facilitate the kid in typing a hundred percent of the time.

351
00:21:53,321 --> 00:22:01,500
Scott: The kid typed the picture that was shown to the facilitator and never did they type the picture that was shown to the child ever.

352
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:13,905
Scott: ha People are fooling parents of autistic children into believing they are communicating with their autistic children when in fact they are Communicating with some facilitator.

353
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:17,634
Rym: now, there are two possible ways to look at this.

354
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:24,230
Rym: either the people doing the facilitating Genuinely genuinely believe they're doing good like something.

355
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,754
Scott: I think it's the Ouija board effect.

356
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:27,499
Rym: Yeah, the idiomotor effect.

357
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:30,187
Rym: Yep Or perhaps even people.

358
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:33,680
Rym: maybe they're con artists, but they think they're helping, you know, they fake it.

359
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:37,996
Rym: But then the parent feels better and the kid, you know what the parent feels like.

360
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:38,920
Rym: they're bonding with the kid.

361
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:40,307
Rym: I love mom Wow.

362
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:41,975
Rym: Look now the mom feels like there's hope.

363
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,457
Rym: Mm-hmm.

364
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:46,255
Scott: However Anyone who thinks the second thing is evil?

365
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:49,447
Scott: Yeah, no Hope is better than false.

366
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:52,036
Scott: Hope if you disagree with that come over here.

367
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:59,202
Scott: I'm gonna beat you up Cuz you deserve a beating, okay No, hope is better than false Hope.

368
00:22:59,686 --> 00:23:00,633
Scott: get that through your head.

369
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:04,429
Scott: if anyone disagrees I dare you to challenge us on that.

370
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,415
Scott: challenge anyone on that.

371
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,659
Scott: who is not evil?

372
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:15,260
Rym: It's just really these people regardless of their motivation or taking advantage of parents who really I mean, there's nowhere they can turn.

373
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,889
Rym: There's no treatment for autism.

374
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:18,197
Rym: There's no way to help these kids.

375
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,530
Scott: Nope So the parents are currently with current scientific science.

376
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:24,255
Scott: There is no hope.

377
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,060
Scott: you will never communicate with your child.

378
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:40,340
Scott: it's sad but true and it's much better if you figure that out right away and deal with it as opposed to having this false hope and Many many painful emotional times through the course of your life.

379
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,645
Rym: Yeah It's not to say you don't try.

380
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:47,087
Rym: I mean still you go to the research institutes and let them do their tests and try But don't expect something.

381
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:56,585
Scott: Yeah, if you get your hopes up about something in which there is no Hope you will consistently be let down and that's much much worse Emotionally speaking.

382
00:23:56,625 --> 00:24:07,080
Scott: then knowing there's no hope and thus when it turns out there's still no Hope you just carry on as usual and then if something actually turns up then you get excited now.

383
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:14,079
Rym: We'd be on a much different tack here If the evidence were inconclusive or if the studies have gone both ways or if there were any evidence at all.

384
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:20,587
Scott: 45 scientific studies and the two I just described to you I think are a hundred percent conclusive.

385
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:24,060
Scott: you'd have to be an idiot to not understand what the hell is going on here.

386
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:37,223
Scott: If I if Rym is incapable of communication with human beings and I take his hand and move it around on a keyboard And use his index finger to push down keys that say something He's evil.

387
00:24:37,464 --> 00:24:39,756
Scott: I'm the one who's communicating not Rym Steve.

388
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:40,520
Scott: Oh Steve.

389
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,855
Scott: Oh There you go.

390
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:52,292
Rym: All right things the day Mine isn't so much.

391
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:52,513
Rym: I don't.

392
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,965
Rym: well, it's a cool thing But I don't have a lot to say about it.

393
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:59,140
Rym: this awesome Mirage appeared in I think Eastern China Shanghai.

394
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:00,448
Scott: Oh, I'm not sure.

395
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:02,078
Rym: basically it was a mirage of a whole city.

396
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:05,399
Scott: Yeah, I saw pictures and I was like, whoa Is that real?

397
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:14,166
Rym: Apparently this area was called the gathering place or the dwelling place of the gods a long time ago because the region the way the Atmosphere is in the water vapor.

398
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:17,760
Rym: It's just very conducive to crazy mirages and illusions.

399
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:19,947
Scott: Yeah, it's like Mirage land.

400
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:20,991
Scott: I think what.

401
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:23,500
Scott: it was just a reflection of the city that was on the other side, right?

402
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,485
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

403
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:26,076
Rym: Yeah, it was cool though.

404
00:25:26,156 --> 00:25:26,559
Rym: Check it out.

405
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:30,295
Scott: I saw a picture and I was like, holy crap a freaking mirage of real.

406
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:31,340
Rym: it made it to dig.

407
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,973
Rym: So I'm sure everyone's seen it already, but that's all I got.

408
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:34,837
Rym: I just want to talk about e3.

409
00:25:35,562 --> 00:25:37,739
Scott: Yeah, my thing of the day is actually a video game.

410
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:43,377
Scott: It's called plasma pong and if you go to plasma pong comm you can download it for free.

411
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:45,394
Scott: and what it is It's only for Windows.

412
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:48,169
Scott: sadly It's just pong.

413
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:49,419
Scott: you play it on the PC.

414
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:55,420
Scott: But you have two extra things you can do in addition to moving the paddle up and moving the paddle down.

415
00:25:55,821 --> 00:26:00,840
Scott: You can shoot plasma out of your paddle and you can suck plasma into your paddle.

416
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:02,950
Rym: It's not nearly as dumb as that just sounded.

417
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:09,277
Scott: No, it looks really cool like a wicked awesome screensaver and the gameplay is actually kind of crazy.

418
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:13,774
Scott: because you have to like Said I'm trying not to say like what's with you in the light.

419
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:14,256
Scott: I don't know.

420
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:14,839
Scott: I like like.

421
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:16,251
Rym: Yeah, you're lucky.

422
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,240
Rym: I don't have a big shield.

423
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,413
Scott: That's what I was gonna say is if you had a big shield.

424
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:24,289
Scott: I would eat it like like Yeah So you spray this plasma and a lot.

425
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:28,380
Scott: the higher the level you get to the more the ball is affected by the plasma.

426
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:36,331
Scott: So the ball is just flying around never actually touching anyone's paddle But bouncing back and forth across the screen in the plasma.

427
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:41,594
Scott: and you have to manipulate the plasma in such a way to get it To fly really fast off the other guy's side of the screen.

428
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:42,318
Scott: so we can't stop it.

429
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:44,191
Rym: Windows only.

430
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,970
Rym: but if I get it to work in wine I'll let everyone know and tell them how to do.

431
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:48,300
Scott: it seems like a pretty simple game.

432
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:50,609
Scott: It should work nicely and it looks really cool.

433
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,370
Rym: You know what the rule of wine is rule number one It will not work.

434
00:26:54,875 --> 00:27:03,389
Scott: rule number two Well, the other final rule of wine is if by some miracle you manage to get it to work It will work better than it works in windows.

435
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,780
Scott: Yeah, that's the best thing about wine.

436
00:27:05,961 --> 00:27:07,045
Rym: Yeah, that's just things.

437
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,875
Rym: either work or they don't and there's really no middle ground with wine.

438
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:13,025
Scott: No, not so much All right.

439
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:23,159
Scott: last time on our e3 coverage We talked about Sony and we talked about the DS and we pretty much covered everything in those departments and nothing has changed In those departments.

440
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:34,455
Scott: yeah, thankfully because I was kind of worried that we were gonna do this big e3 show and then all this new information would Come out on the show floor and we'd have to go back and add all that stuff in.

441
00:27:34,656 --> 00:27:37,107
Rym: that is true for Nintendo but we didn't talk about Nintendo.

442
00:27:37,128 --> 00:27:37,570
Scott: you intend?

443
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,270
Scott: Oh and Mike the Nintendo Wii and The Microsoft Xbox 360?

444
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,380
Scott: there was some new tidbits on the show floor.

445
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:47,009
Rym: Yeah, actually there was a lot for Nintendo.

446
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:49,037
Scott: Oh a whole lot the more than anyone else at least.

447
00:27:49,258 --> 00:27:49,880
Rym: well in general.

448
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:52,757
Rym: Here's here's the the general vibe of what's going on at e3.

449
00:27:53,862 --> 00:27:59,722
Rym: There are crazy crazy lines for everything Nintendo has constantly There is.

450
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:06,140
Scott: you have to wait and in line for I think the guess was six hours to play with a Wii.

451
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,796
Rym: I can play with a Wii right now for free.

452
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:12,900
Scott: I know I don't know why people waiting in six lines six hour lines to do it if you want hell of a Wii.

453
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:20,253
Scott: One guy was at his first e3 and he got in the Wii line and he says I'm not wasting six hours on my first E3 and he just said I just won't use the Wii at e3.

454
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:21,299
Scott: I'll do everything else instead.

455
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:26,660
Scott: But yeah, it really sucks for the journalists who have to use it to you know.

456
00:28:27,461 --> 00:28:28,849
Rym: Yeah now compare that.

457
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:43,434
Scott: it will compare and contrast that to Sony and Microsoft where Sony and Microsoft booths the people were estimating you had to wait maybe five minutes to play anything you wanted Anything any game that was playable at Microsoft's or Sony's booth.

458
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:45,280
Rym: five-minute wait other than Tendo.

459
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,919
Scott: Six hour wait to use the Wii other than panels going around.

460
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:55,476
Rym: E3 is basically just a cluster of people fighting to get into Nintendo's area at all times and nothing else.

461
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,462
Scott: and This you know.

462
00:28:58,143 --> 00:29:01,191
Scott: people accuse us of being anti Sony Pro.

463
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:07,296
Scott: whatever we tell it like it is if you're if we were biased or Anything we'd be saying Microsoft sucks even though they're not second.

464
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:08,000
Scott: so much right now.

465
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:17,019
Rym: Yeah, cuz I really didn't like the Xbox when it came out But I'm starting to take a shine and the fact that I might buy one is kind of scary to me.

466
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:22,872
Scott: Yeah, when you listen to us talk, you know, we are gonna say some fanboys things like oh my god We really like that.

467
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:23,420
Scott: It's awesome.

468
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,736
Scott: Like you might not like Wario where smooth moves, but that's our favorite thing in the world.

469
00:29:27,836 --> 00:29:30,758
Scott: so you can tell okay They really like Wario where and you might not.

470
00:29:31,422 --> 00:29:38,369
Scott: But pay attention when we say things like there's a six hour wait for Nintendo And there's a five hour wait for Sony and Microsoft.

471
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:40,215
Scott: That's not fanboyism opinion.

472
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:40,937
Scott: That's a fact.

473
00:29:41,318 --> 00:29:44,183
Rym: Well, it's like the At will.

474
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:48,116
Rym: now, I mean we keep talking about the PSP like we never see anyone playing.

475
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:48,638
Scott: is it like?

476
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:51,310
Rym: yeah Well, but I was I used it properly.

477
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:53,220
Rym: I didn't use it as a breakup.

478
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:55,427
Rym: We see things like.

479
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:57,837
Rym: that's a proper grammatical use of the word.

480
00:29:57,877 --> 00:30:03,660
Rym: like that's fine Let's get on with the show so you can go to sleep Alright, I just because there's people arguing about the PSP and I wanted to get this out.

481
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:05,348
Scott: Alright get it out now before we start.

482
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:09,924
Rym: the fact is that at e3 No one has PSP's.

483
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:13,292
Rym: reporters have said this everyone has DS's and they're playing them constantly.

484
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:14,435
Scott: That's a fact.

485
00:30:14,475 --> 00:30:21,075
Rym: That's not you know, I Said, you know, that was great All right, I guess we can't talk about this.

486
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:23,587
Scott: Yeah, mr Why interpret that fact as you will?

487
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:26,938
Scott: but there are DS's everywhere and PSP's nowhere to be seen.

488
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:34,900
Scott: at e3 The premier gaming event of the year there are DS's all over the place and no PSP's to be seen except for Sony's booth.

489
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,829
Rym: Alright, so let's start at the beginning with Nintendo.

490
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:41,720
Rym: cuz I I don't want to start with the stuff that was just announced.

491
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:45,176
Scott: Well, I was figured we would do the system and then we do the games for the Wii.

492
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,327
Scott: All right Well, no, let's start out with the GameCube.

493
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:49,678
Scott: There's gonna be a new GameCube game at the end of the year.

494
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:52,652
Scott: Great Super Paper Mario.

495
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,120
Rym: Oh my god.

496
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,591
Scott: Now if you played Paper Mario thousand-year door, you know that well.

497
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:10,820
Scott: or any Paper Mario, you know that Paper Mario is on Mario RPG type game and The interesting thing about it is that Mario and all his friends are made of paper and the world is made of paper.

498
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:24,980
Scott: So they do a lot of interesting tricks like Mario will tear a hole in the background and he'll sneak through a secret or He'll roll himself up like a piece of or fold himself into a paper airplane and fly and such.

499
00:31:25,702 --> 00:31:31,980
Rym: The games are also real heavy on the Nintendo style humor slash, you know world which we like a lot.

500
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:33,804
Scott: Yeah, lots of Mario Joe.

501
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:36,110
Rym: Nothing's better than a cute little girl Goomba.

502
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:38,717
Scott: Yeah girl archaeologist Goomba.

503
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:58,558
Scott: Yeah now in Paper Mario thousand-year door, there was a short sequence where Koopa King Koopa did some Mario Super Mario 1 style side scrolling and he got really ate a giant piece of meat and Became the size of the screen and smashed up a whole bunch of stuff.

504
00:31:59,322 --> 00:32:02,696
Scott: But you you know, you controlled that for maybe five minutes of the game and that was it.

505
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:08,406
Scott: Yeah Super Paper Mario is Not going to be an RPG.

506
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:11,360
Scott: It's going to be a Super Mario platform game.

507
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:20,727
Scott: However, everything is made of paper and has the same graphics that thousand-year door has and you can play as Mario the princess and Koopa Who each do their own different things?

508
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:23,920
Scott: It's like a Mario - it's gonna be a really good.

509
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,748
Scott: Well, I think you switch between them at will at least.

510
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:32,947
Scott: I saw a video where Mario flipped over and the princess appeared Like in the middle of a level.

511
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:36,119
Scott: Oh, yeah, and I think I saw Koopa breathing some fire.

512
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:54,430
Scott: and When the best thing about this game is there is apparently a power-up that not only makes you tremendously huge filling the screen But when you use this power-up, it returns the character to their 8-bit pixelated Sprite as opposed to the new shiny Paper Mario sprite.

513
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:59,846
Scott: So imagine a giant Super Mario Brothers Princess Peach or King Koopa.

514
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:04,580
Scott: that's like the size of the screen smashing everything that's worth it alone for whatever this game cost.

515
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,398
Scott: So that's the GameCube news one new game gonna come out at the end of the year.

516
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:14,660
Scott: Oh Also the Zelda game that everyone knows about will have a GameCube version.

517
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:21,420
Rym: Yeah, Twilight Princess is going to be released at the same time, but separately on both the revolution and the GameCube.

518
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,480
Scott: Yeah, people thought that there would be one GameCube because they said it's gonna be a GameCube game.

519
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,919
Scott: They said that and they didn't lie.

520
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:40,949
Scott: But people thought that there would be a GameCube version that if you played the GameCube version on the Wii you would get advanced features sort of like Mario, Zelda ages and seasons for the Game Boy Color.

521
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:44,679
Scott: if you played it on a Game Boy Advance a few secret things showed up.

522
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:47,040
Scott: That's not going to be the case.

523
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,333
Scott: The Zelda game is gonna have a Wii version and a GameCube version.

524
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:51,377
Scott: you buy one or the other.

525
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:53,211
Scott: if you buy both You're just kind of dumb.

526
00:33:53,594 --> 00:34:01,555
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so if you have a GameCube and you're not planning on buying a Wii for a long time That's the only way I can recommend buying the Zelda GameCube.

527
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,739
Rym: now I we don't really need to talk about this game.

528
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:07,350
Rym: everyone knows it looks like it's going to be awesome.

529
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:12,539
Rym: several Nintendo people have said things along the lines of We think this is the best Zelda we've ever made.

530
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:21,453
Scott: Yeah, but that's what they said and people had mixed reactions to them saying that some people are like, okay This is gonna be the best Zelda ever.

531
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:26,511
Scott: and some people said Okay, they're being real defensive about this Zelda being so great.

532
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:27,995
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

533
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:29,600
Rym: the game looks really cool.

534
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:32,384
Scott: It looks like Zelda.

535
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:35,759
Scott: it looks like what everyone wanted Wind Waker to be but wasn't.

536
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,699
Rym: yeah It looks like Zelda 64 taken to the technological and plot extreme.

537
00:34:40,803 --> 00:34:43,100
Scott: All I can hope is that it has more dungeons.

538
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,054
Scott: That was my number one complaint with the recent Zelda games is not enough done.

539
00:34:47,094 --> 00:34:47,335
Scott: freaking.

540
00:34:47,395 --> 00:34:49,862
Rym: minish cap had three Frickin.

541
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:52,494
Scott: Wind Waker had like four or five.

542
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:53,800
Scott: not you need more dungeons.

543
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:59,520
Scott: I want to seize SNES style Zeldas where there's like four dungeons followed by eight dungeons.

544
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:01,323
Scott: Stuff like that.

545
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:03,590
Scott: That's what we need lots and lots of dungeons.

546
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,700
Scott: That's what make Zelda great a big overworld lots and lots of dungeons.

547
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,951
Scott: Okay, let's talk about the Wii system and what they said about it.

548
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:13,860
Rym: in those preference the conference they had was pretty cool.

549
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:18,844
Scott: They had it in the Kodak theater, which is the place they have the Oscars Now.

550
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:31,251
Rym: it started basically with Miyamoto In a tuxedo with a Wii controller Conducting an orchestra playing the Legend of Zelda but the orchestra wasn't real.

551
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:40,713
Scott: the orchestra was a Part of a video game and as he was actually as he moved the controller differently You could see that he was controlling the temple of the orchestra.

552
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:42,260
Rym: Yeah all the Wii controller.

553
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,620
Rym: I'll say now that all almost everything they showed was not a pre-rendered demo where they faked it.

554
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,860
Rym: It was someone controlling something with the controller.

555
00:35:50,362 --> 00:36:00,131
Scott: People were saying how the Metroid stuff that they showed was a video and not you know Someone actually playing the game at that moment, but it didn't look like a pre-render.

556
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:02,498
Scott: It looked like actual gameplay video footage.

557
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:05,207
Rym: Yeah Now the crowd went wild.

558
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:07,154
Scott: Yeah, the crowd is, you know crazy.

559
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:10,287
Scott: Okay, so The Wii.

560
00:36:10,749 --> 00:36:13,280
Scott: what do we know about the Wii that we didn't know before?

561
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:15,809
Scott: Well, they confirmed a bunch of rumors.

562
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,000
Scott: there is going to be a speaker in the Wii controller.

563
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:20,419
Scott: What does this mean?

564
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:28,980
Scott: It means When you shoot use the Wii controller as a gun and pull the trigger on it the Wii controller itself will make a firing noise.

565
00:36:29,345 --> 00:36:32,448
Scott: Now that's kind of cool But what's the use now?

566
00:36:32,729 --> 00:36:37,312
Scott: I figured this out when someone you know started talking about it And I think might have been the Engadget podcast.

567
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:40,810
Scott: they were like, okay You have a Wii controller, right?

568
00:36:41,272 --> 00:36:42,859
Scott: Let's say you're shooting a bow and arrow.

569
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:48,200
Scott: Now when you're shooting a real bow and arrow, you have a string, you know, how far back you're pulling it.

570
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:52,856
Scott: You can hear the string getting tighter and tighter with a Wii controller.

571
00:36:52,916 --> 00:37:01,471
Scott: Just pulling it back You can't really tell how far back you've pulled it and looking at the screen You can't tell because it's a first-person view twang.

572
00:37:02,122 --> 00:37:11,859
Scott: So this speaker in the Wii controller is actually necessary Because it will make a noise as you pull the bow string back to let you know how far back you are.

573
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:20,387
Rym: Also when I finally get my lightsaber game because I have no doubt that there's going to be some sort of lightsaber game LucasArts said we're looking into it.

574
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:21,813
Scott: That's all the news we've got.

575
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:22,897
Rym: My Wii is gonna be going.

576
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:28,499
Rym: wow And that's just awesome.

577
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,699
Scott: Yeah, I didn't even think no one thought of having that speaker but Nintendo thought of it and now that you know about it It's so essential.

578
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:36,426
Rym: I mean, I just think it's so key.

579
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:44,137
Rym: imagine all the Mario Party WarioWare minigames You can have where one guy's controller makes a noise and everyone reacts.

580
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:44,739
Rym: because of that.

581
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,005
Rym: We got to figure out.

582
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:49,460
Rym: you got to guess whose controller made the noise or do something.

583
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:54,320
Scott: Someone suggested that you would talk into a microphone on the controller then pass the controller.

584
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,619
Scott: Someone would push a button and the controller would play back what you said.

585
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:04,184
Scott: then they'd have to say that into the controller and pass it around like a game of telephone and Silly things can happen.

586
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:05,108
Rym: Nintendo's really.

587
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:11,979
Rym: it's like they put so many things into this so that Developers making games have crazy options to do whatever they want to do.

588
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:21,351
Scott: Yeah The problem is when developers try to use all the options instead of just trying to make a game That really needs the option.

589
00:38:21,371 --> 00:38:23,420
Rym: Yep, which luckily seems to have worked out for the DS.

590
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:30,060
Scott: Yeah, a lot of early DS people games have made the error of forcing themselves to use every feature.

591
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:34,499
Rym: Yeah, like bomber man God bomber man used the touchscreen and perhaps the stupidest way ever.

592
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:40,155
Scott: But now they're coming back and it seems people realized what's good and what's not.

593
00:38:40,597 --> 00:38:41,680
Scott: so it shouldn't take them.

594
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:45,336
Scott: I don't imagine too many screw-ups on the Wii now that they figured it out in the DS.

595
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:49,719
Scott: Yeah Okay What don't we know about the Wii?

596
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:51,562
Rym: The price.

597
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:56,481
Scott: we don't know the price and we don't know the release date other than it will be in October November December of This year.

598
00:38:56,943 --> 00:39:03,046
Rym: now once again Nintendo is probably gonna stick to their promise that it'll be less than two hundred and fifty dollars or less $300 no matter what.

599
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,639
Scott: I think the only promise was it'll be cheaper than anything else.

600
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:09,189
Scott: Yeah, so it could be $300, but I really doubt that.

601
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:09,851
Scott: I really doubt it.

602
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:10,252
Scott: Also.

603
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:13,180
Scott: Everyone's the best guess is two hundred two hundred fifty dollars.

604
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,705
Rym: Yeah, someone on slash.

605
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:18,759
Rym: I was like if it was a hundred and fifty that would just destroy the industry in my.

606
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:24,940
Scott: I Think they're just waiting to see what the final word is on everything else before they decide how they can set their price.

607
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,328
Scott: Yeah, I already know the price.

608
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:28,633
Scott: everybody is waiting to reveal it.

609
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:30,220
Scott: That way they can keep the news rolling.

610
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:31,280
Rym: That's what I was about to say.

611
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:37,660
Rym: They're probably because they've right before e3 they announced that they're calling it the Wii and there was crazy press buzzing.

612
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:40,166
Rym: Then e3 crazy press buzzing.

613
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:43,435
Rym: then they announced Smash Brothers crazy press buzzing.

614
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:45,721
Rym: then they're gonna announce the date crazy Press.

615
00:39:46,002 --> 00:39:53,127
Rym: then they're gonna announce the price and they're always in the news until finally it's release day Plus they also get to announce.

616
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:58,487
Scott: pre-orders are now available, you know, there's a lot of things They just announced to keep the news rolling.

617
00:39:58,768 --> 00:40:02,460
Rym: Yep, as opposed to Sony we're gonna release the ps3 in March.

618
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:05,959
Rym: We're gonna release it in not March.

619
00:40:06,601 --> 00:40:17,493
Scott: yeah, I don't know what's better saying a date and then delaying it and then saying another exact date and then eventually sticking to one of Those exact dates or not saying anything and then eventually sticking to a date.

620
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:19,983
Rym: Apple seems to do very well with the hey Guess what?

621
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:25,040
Scott: We just did as opposed to hey It's available on the Apple Store as soon as we stop talking.

622
00:40:25,622 --> 00:40:28,051
Rym: Yeah, like when the Apple Store goes down everyone knows.

623
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:29,817
Rym: Oh something just happened.

624
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:32,839
Scott: Yep What else do we know about the Wii?

625
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:36,068
Scott: There won't be any load times.

626
00:40:36,108 --> 00:40:38,337
Scott: He's promised us no load times.

627
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:39,220
Rym: Now, that's great.

628
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,534
Rym: I mean even the GameCube had a few load times in some games, but those are tiny.

629
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:45,500
Scott: Yeah, I think it was mostly.

630
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:47,264
Scott: No, the load times.

631
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:48,188
Scott: I've noticed in games.

632
00:40:48,268 --> 00:41:00,578
Rym: I have where where there were FMV's and Basically FMV's Yeah, and it seems that third-party port games have load games much more often than first-party games or second-party games.

633
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:07,197
Scott: Yep I think because of the flash memory in the Wii you're not gonna see load times at all unless someone really really sucks.

634
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:12,354
Scott: Yeah There's going to be a Wii classic controller.

635
00:41:12,515 --> 00:41:24,231
Rym: It looks like this white Super NES controller like a cross between an SNES controller and a GameCube controller, but it's all white and we colored and People who have held on to it said that it feels right.

636
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:26,320
Scott: Yeah, it looks like it feels right.

637
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:35,009
Scott: I guess you're gonna use it for your virtual console games, you know, your old-school NES games Yep, which they finally released some pictures and talk about.

638
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:39,684
Scott: the only thing I'm it's weird about this controller Is that it isn't wireless.

639
00:41:39,725 --> 00:41:49,809
Scott: you plug it into the bottom of the Wii controller where the nunchuck usually plugs into and I Guess does that mean you're kind of tethered to the Wii.

640
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:52,860
Scott: is there gonna be something that lets you use both at once or switch?

641
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,749
Scott: Between the two or I don't know.

642
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:56,940
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of tiny details.

643
00:41:57,021 --> 00:41:59,558
Rym: We're really not gonna get until we get closer to the release date.

644
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:03,640
Scott: Someone made a comment that Nintendo always screws up one little thing.

645
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,442
Scott: That doesn't matter.

646
00:42:04,643 --> 00:42:04,863
Scott: like.

647
00:42:04,884 --> 00:42:07,270
Scott: on the NES they screwed up.

648
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,614
Scott: You have to blow into the cartridges.

649
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:11,786
Scott: Yeah on the SNES I don't think anything was screwed up.

650
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:13,616
Rym: No, no, you know what was wrong with the SNES.

651
00:42:13,737 --> 00:42:19,293
Rym: Mm-hmm Some button now because I had no problem with that though I know a few people did but you could just yank the game out.

652
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:19,776
Rym: It didn't matter.

653
00:42:19,796 --> 00:42:20,179
Scott: That's true.

654
00:42:20,861 --> 00:42:23,240
Rym: Some not all the SNES is because they fixed it later.

655
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,120
Rym: But a lot of them if you left him in the Sun they turn this horrible yellow.

656
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,446
Rym: That's true because of the plastic.

657
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:30,280
Scott: that's not a big deal now in 64 didn't have enough memory.

658
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,420
Scott: They had to add an expansion thing the GameCube.

659
00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:35,632
Scott: What problems with the GameCube?

660
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,761
Scott: I can't think of any Hmm.

661
00:42:38,524 --> 00:42:39,347
Scott: Yeah, I guess not.

662
00:42:39,628 --> 00:42:42,580
Rym: some people early on said it overheated, but it just turned out they were idiots.

663
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:50,000
Scott: Yeah, the DS had a. the DS light has a problem with the GBA cartridge not fitting all the way in.

664
00:42:50,392 --> 00:42:55,620
Rym: Yeah But I mean that one at least is understandable because they they wanted it to be small and that seems to be what people wanted.

665
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:58,112
Scott: Yep, the GBA the screen didn't have a light.

666
00:42:58,474 --> 00:42:59,338
Scott: people complained.

667
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:03,140
Rym: Yeah I remember the penny arcade that came out the day after the GBA came out.

668
00:43:03,902 --> 00:43:09,020
Scott: Yeah, so the problem with the Wii is that the classic controller is gonna have to plug into the bottom of the normal controller.

669
00:43:09,844 --> 00:43:17,747
Rym: Oh, well, yeah, though from the looks of the virtual console I mean they showed screenshots of where when you play a game It'll show you a screen where it shows.

670
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:20,397
Rym: here's what all the buttons are mapped to and you can probably change them.

671
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:23,268
Scott: Yep The Wii controller is going to rumble.

672
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:24,332
Scott: take that Sony.

673
00:43:24,753 --> 00:43:26,379
Rym: Yeah now think about that.

674
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:33,980
Rym: Not only because it make noise not only is it perfectly tuned spatially to this console, but it rumbles.

675
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:40,860
Scott: So when you get hit, you know, when you hit your sword against the other guy's sword you feel it go and it goes.

676
00:43:42,421 --> 00:43:45,944
Scott: Wow, all right The nunchuck thing.

677
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:47,589
Scott: This is a rumor that was confirmed.

678
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,231
Scott: We'll have.

679
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:51,020
Scott: this will basically be equivalent to the PlayStation 3 controller.

680
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:54,820
Scott: It can't tell where you're aiming it, but it can tell when you tilt it and move it around.

681
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,485
Scott: That's good for a lot of video games.

682
00:43:57,525 --> 00:44:02,338
Scott: I imagine using it to dodge or throw you offhand weapons.

683
00:44:02,438 --> 00:44:08,434
Scott: Yeah Um Then we will have the Opera web browser eventually just like the DS.

684
00:44:08,494 --> 00:44:09,337
Scott: Well real soon.

685
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:10,524
Rym: Yes I'm still.

686
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:12,338
Rym: I really want it for the DS like I am.

687
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:14,048
Scott: I don't know why I need it on the Wii.

688
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,159
Scott: I have a computer plugged into my TV.

689
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,272
Scott: Yeah, well, I guess people don't have a computer plugged into their TV.

690
00:44:20,313 --> 00:44:20,995
Scott: This will be useful.

691
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:21,919
Rym: Most people don't.

692
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:28,198
Scott: I mean We're really the minority Yeah, and I guess it'll be really easy to use because you can just aim the Wii controller at the links and click on them.

693
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:35,880
Scott: It also I think will be cool because you'll visit the Nintendo website and such with your Nintendo product.

694
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:39,320
Scott: Yeah, and they could make some hookups in that department, you know?

695
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:45,541
Scott: Maybe some sort of web integration sort of like Microsoft has with the Xbox 360.

696
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:50,439
Scott: Here's one that people are seem to be confused about and I'm gonna try to shed as much light as I can as possible.

697
00:44:51,282 --> 00:44:55,717
Scott: We connect 24. the Wii is never gonna be turned off.

698
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,906
Scott: basically You're always gonna have it on.

699
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:01,816
Scott: it'll always be connected to the internet and powered on.

700
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:04,255
Scott: even when you turn it off It'll be a little bit on.

701
00:45:04,276 --> 00:45:04,902
Rym: now I know.

702
00:45:04,922 --> 00:45:16,039
Rym: when the PlayStation 2 came out People had a lot of trouble with the fact that once you plugged it in and turn on that switch in the back It was always on with the you basically just suspended it.

703
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,049
Rym: Yeah, red light green light, but people didn't understand that and they would always like turn their ps2 off hard Which wasn't good for it?

704
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:23,079
Scott: No, not good at all.

705
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:26,820
Rym: Yeah, though Nintendo is doing a lot more than just leaving it in suspend mode.

706
00:45:27,222 --> 00:45:37,340
Scott: Yes, not only will leaving it in suspend mode allow you to turn it on quicker So boot time will be almost, you know, even less exist and not that there was boot time on GameCube or anything.

707
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,523
Rym: It'll be doing stuff.

708
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:54,260
Scott: Yeah, so the kind of stuff they talked about is games can get patched and updated and new things will be Unlocked without you having to wait for them because they'll just happen when you're not using the Wii or using the Wii's network connection.

709
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:56,308
Rym: Yeah, say you're online and Nintendo decides.

710
00:45:56,649 --> 00:45:58,536
Rym: All right, because it's uh, I don't know.

711
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:01,960
Rym: pick a holiday Hanukkah Hanukkah Harry.

712
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:02,662
Rym: They're gonna.

713
00:46:02,702 --> 00:46:07,979
Rym: they're gonna add a Hanukkah Harry thing to Smash Brothers for anyone who has it and they just do it on Hanukkah.

714
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,593
Scott: Yeah, and they do it the night before Hanukkah.

715
00:46:10,613 --> 00:46:15,578
Scott: when you're not playing your Wii Still on and killing the little kids Hanukkah Harry sneaks in.

716
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:15,880
Scott: that's it.

717
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,642
Rym: Whatever he does.

718
00:46:16,843 --> 00:46:26,280
Scott: the example they gave was for Animal Crossing that you would have your Animal Crossing Village I guess would always be sort of on a little bit.

719
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:33,610
Scott: So if someone sent you some Animal Crossing messages while you weren't playing Animal Crossing They would just come in because the Wii is always on.

720
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,468
Scott: so they'd be downloaded whenever and then the next time you play Animal Crossing There they would be.

721
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:38,156
Scott: look at that.

722
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,159
Rym: That's huge, I mean I'm not a fan of those games so much anymore.

723
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:46,000
Rym: Not not so much because I don't think they're cool because I don't have time for that crap.

724
00:46:46,242 --> 00:46:51,516
Scott: Yeah, I don't have time for Animal Crossing though I think I might play it once cuz I'm a little bit interested in some of the stuff.

725
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:52,219
Scott: I don't know about it.

726
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,613
Rym: Yeah, those are the kind of games that I used to play religiously when I was a kid But now I just I can't do it.

727
00:46:57,775 --> 00:46:58,480
Scott: I can't deal with it.

728
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:00,914
Rym: I can't even deal with like Sim City 2000 anymore.

729
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:01,940
Rym: It just takes too long.

730
00:47:02,241 --> 00:47:04,729
Rym: Yeah, I just cheat but I think this is huge.

731
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:10,476
Rym: just that the Animal Crossing people and the people who like these games Are a big segment of the market.

732
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:14,470
Scott: now Animal Crossing sold crazy crazy in Japan.

733
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:20,800
Scott: Animal Crossing DS sold crazy in Japan Crazy crazy and it sold really well in the u.s.

734
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,589
Rym: To the fact that people could wirelessly interact.

735
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,259
Rym: their cities was like this crazy thing for people.

736
00:47:27,122 --> 00:47:35,978
Scott: Now with the Wii and the your city is always there and it says on the Nintendo website Something we already knew is that the Wii can connect to the DS.

737
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:37,063
Scott: now They never.

738
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:42,800
Scott: they haven't given example of anyone doing this yet, but they did say that it's technologically possible.

739
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:48,310
Scott: so you can just wait for Animal Crossing DS plus Animal Crossing.

740
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,137
Scott: we kind of action going on.

741
00:47:50,398 --> 00:47:55,700
Rym: or you know The ultimate uber extension of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles where you have a DS.

742
00:47:56,322 --> 00:48:01,139
Rym: Yeah, and there's your TV all wireless and all online with other people.

743
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:05,420
Scott: They'll make some cable that goes from the DS to the bottom of the Wii controller.

744
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,259
Scott: Okay So that's pretty much the story with the Wii.

745
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:13,168
Rym: Yeah, it's everyone seems to like it.

746
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:13,850
Rym: the games.

747
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:14,853
Rym: They've demoed the games.

748
00:48:14,874 --> 00:48:16,660
Rym: They've got their people are raving about.

749
00:48:17,122 --> 00:48:18,869
Scott: Let's talk about all the games for the Wii.

750
00:48:19,472 --> 00:48:21,299
Rym: All right, they've got this sports game.

751
00:48:21,961 --> 00:48:25,972
Scott: Now my opinion of this sports game is it's it's called Wii Sports.

752
00:48:26,774 --> 00:48:29,000
Scott: It's got tennis golf and baseball.

753
00:48:29,402 --> 00:48:31,590
Rym: I think it's a great idea to have them bundled like this.

754
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,698
Rym: It's very much the see what the we can do.

755
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:33,980
Rym: game.

756
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:43,540
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like how you have solitaire that originally came with Microsoft Windows because Everyone had been using DOS and no one knows how to use a mouse.

757
00:48:44,183 --> 00:48:46,135
Scott: So they put out solitaire.

758
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:53,202
Scott: that came with Windows Which you would no doubt want to try right away because it's a game and you would learn how to use the mouse by playing Solitaire.

759
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,088
Scott: Wii Sports is the same thing.

760
00:48:55,128 --> 00:48:58,318
Scott: you learn how to use the wiimote by playing Wii Sports plus.

761
00:48:58,358 --> 00:48:59,442
Rym: it looks fun Mm-hmm.

762
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:03,780
Scott: I really think though they that they should bundle Wii Sports with the Wii.

763
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:05,859
Scott: It should be a free game that comes with the system.

764
00:49:06,623 --> 00:49:09,900
Scott: I mean, this isn't something people are gonna pay 50 bucks for maybe 20 bucks.

765
00:49:10,604 --> 00:49:13,017
Rym: Yeah, I could see if they don't bundle it selling it for like 15 bucks.

766
00:49:13,821 --> 00:49:18,798
Scott: But think about it every time Nintendo has released a new peripheral that no one knew how to use.

767
00:49:18,818 --> 00:49:21,872
Scott: the zapper They put out duck hunt the super scope.

768
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:23,501
Scott: They came with a super scope 6.

769
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:25,807
Rym: Yep, the power came with Mario Paint.

770
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:27,271
Scott: the mouse came with Mario Paint.

771
00:49:27,692 --> 00:49:29,859
Scott: the power pad came with track and field.

772
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,480
Scott: now This is a new peripheral that's coming with a system.

773
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:35,199
Scott: So it's a little bit different than a peripheral coming out on its own.

774
00:49:35,701 --> 00:49:40,536
Scott: But the wiimote should come with Wii Sports to teach you how to use the wiimote plus.

775
00:49:40,556 --> 00:49:41,860
Rym: think about what that would do in the market.

776
00:49:42,141 --> 00:49:45,015
Rym: It's been a long time since consoles came with games.

777
00:49:45,478 --> 00:49:57,378
Scott: Oh, yeah Well, what usually happens nowadays is the original console comes without a game and then later on they release bundle packs Like now if you buy a GameCube, I think it comes with Metroid Prime or something.

778
00:49:57,398 --> 00:49:57,880
Scott: I'm not sure.

779
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,883
Scott: Yeah, there are different ones you can get like you can get the Pokemon GameCube that comes with Pokemon XD or whatever It's called.

780
00:50:04,465 --> 00:50:07,902
Rym: I just remember when I got my NES and it came with Mario Brothers Duck hunt.

781
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,089
Scott: mine came with Mario Duck hunt and the red zapper.

782
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,233
Rym: Yeah, red zapper.

783
00:50:11,354 --> 00:50:12,016
Scott: Yeah red zapper.

784
00:50:12,698 --> 00:50:19,728
Scott: All right There's one called project hammer and it's actually made by Nintendo and this game.

785
00:50:19,748 --> 00:50:21,070
Rym: I don't know what to say about this game.

786
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:24,228
Rym: Um All I get things with a hammer.

787
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:28,150
Scott: Yeah, you basically someone said hey, you know, it'd be really awesome.

788
00:50:28,873 --> 00:50:30,500
Scott: If you see you could swing a hammer around.

789
00:50:30,601 --> 00:50:32,750
Scott: everyone wants to just run around smashing stuff.

790
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,944
Scott: Let's make a game where all you do is run around smashing shit with a hammer for some reason.

791
00:50:36,984 --> 00:50:40,096
Rym: I keep picturing communist Mario I guess.

792
00:50:40,116 --> 00:50:41,141
Scott: yeah big-ass hammer.

793
00:50:41,161 --> 00:50:42,688
Scott: I think that's what this game is.

794
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:44,735
Scott: There was one game.

795
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:46,220
Scott: I think actually this game.

796
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,744
Scott: They didn't show actual footage of.

797
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:49,570
Scott: I guess I was wrong before.

798
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:57,478
Scott: This is one game where all they showed were pre-rendered FMV's which it was something something disaster Which looked like every disaster movie ever.

799
00:50:57,538 --> 00:50:58,401
Scott: it rolled into one.

800
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:00,167
Scott: I don't know how the game works.

801
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:01,090
Scott: I don't know anything about it.

802
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:04,363
Scott: I think you manage disaster recovery teams or something.

803
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:08,556
Rym: Yeah, I didn't really look into that one Super Mario Galaxy.

804
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:09,619
Rym: All right, they said.

805
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:10,843
Rym: they've said more than once.

806
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:12,489
Rym: It's not going to be a launch game.

807
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:20,770
Scott: Yep, it's probably gonna come out soon after though It'd be sort of like how Super Mario Brothers wasn't a launch game for the NES.

808
00:51:21,571 --> 00:51:25,370
Scott: Yeah, most people don't really remember shine wasn't a launch game for the GameCube.

809
00:51:25,591 --> 00:51:28,741
Rym: Yeah, the launch game for the GameCube was Luigi's Mansion.

810
00:51:29,022 --> 00:51:31,530
Scott: Yeah, which is alright, but it wasn't long enough at all.

811
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,642
Rym: Yeah, it was definitely more a tech demo than a game.

812
00:51:33,662 --> 00:51:34,084
Scott: Yep.

813
00:51:34,607 --> 00:51:40,190
Scott: Yep But yeah, Super Mario Galaxy looks like a really fun awesome Mario game.

814
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:43,365
Rym: Yeah, I mean just watching the scenes from playing the game.

815
00:51:43,425 --> 00:51:44,350
Rym: It just looks badass.

816
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:50,070
Scott: It looks like they took the good parts of Super Mario Sunshine and left out the bad parts and put them in this game.

817
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:55,254
Rym: You know because the only part I liked about Mario Sunshine really were those QB.

818
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:58,469
Rym: but you know you go you go into the tube or the whatever to the place.

819
00:51:59,053 --> 00:52:01,350
Scott: Yeah secret of the the blankety blank.

820
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:02,515
Rym: Yeah We have to run through.

821
00:52:02,535 --> 00:52:09,090
Scott: there's like a rotating cube and then a bunch of Platforms moving around the part where you didn't have your little water pack and it was all for me.

822
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,174
Rym: I didn't like that water pack.

823
00:52:10,535 --> 00:52:21,550
Scott: No, so this Super Mario Galaxy looks like it's gonna be The you know cool part of Mario Sunshine with using the wiimote, which is plus plus.

824
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:23,536
Scott: We'll see how it actually turns out.

825
00:52:23,636 --> 00:52:28,630
Scott: All you've seen are some, you know in-game footages, but at least there weren't bull shots.

826
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:31,057
Rym: It looks like it'll be real intuitive to play.

827
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:34,909
Scott: All right next up the ultimate party game not Mario party.

828
00:52:35,471 --> 00:52:37,798
Scott: WarioWare smooth moves now.

829
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:44,159
Rym: way back when WarioWare came out for the Gameboy I thought that looks dumb.

830
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,283
Scott: I didn't think it looks dumb.

831
00:52:45,323 --> 00:52:47,310
Scott: I said that I said that looks interesting.

832
00:52:47,692 --> 00:52:51,089
Scott: It's worth about 10 bucks because a bunch of really really tiny games.

833
00:52:51,832 --> 00:52:56,045
Rym: Once they made the GameCube multiplayer one, that was crazy.

834
00:52:56,065 --> 00:52:57,770
Rym: That was better than Mario Party.

835
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,490
Scott: Yeah, WarioWare on its own isn't so fun.

836
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,650
Scott: It's just something to sort of pass the time.

837
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:06,265
Scott: Busy work as much as brain games is or any of those other ones.

838
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:10,450
Scott: but WarioWare Multiplayer all of a sudden is an amazing thing.

839
00:53:10,831 --> 00:53:11,534
Rym: I mean all the.

840
00:53:11,574 --> 00:53:17,808
Rym: we have all these memories of going to the shore in Wildwood and sitting around in the beach house Just playing WarioWare long into the night.

841
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:21,210
Scott: It's really no better party game than WarioWare.

842
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:27,570
Scott: So WarioWare with a Wii controller that has you hula dancing and lassoing and jumping and lifting.

843
00:53:28,193 --> 00:53:44,805
Scott: So now instead of four people sitting around with GameCube or Gameboy's Controllers sitting in front of the TV pushing buttons going Oh Wario Which is a lot of fun now people are gonna be dancing around the room Jumping and swinging and all kinds of craziness that I can only imagine.

844
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:47,952
Rym: This is gonna be fantastic All right.

845
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:51,844
Scott: Here's one game that sort of surprised me excite truck.

846
00:53:52,947 --> 00:53:55,412
Rym: It looks fun Apparently.

847
00:53:55,452 --> 00:53:58,322
Scott: when I first saw it I said, oh there's some random truck game.

848
00:53:58,422 --> 00:54:03,008
Scott: then Reggie said it was excite truck and I was like Hahaha, it's a Nintendo game.

849
00:54:03,872 --> 00:54:09,490
Scott: It's you control it with the Wiimote and you tilt the Wiimote to steer the truck and there's a boost button and whatnot.

850
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:18,490
Rym: That's one genre that Nintendo's been lacking for a long time semi realistic or non Mario Kart racing games.

851
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,976
Scott: That's really the reason I want a 360 or a ps3.

852
00:54:20,996 --> 00:54:29,025
Scott: probably a 360 or maybe ps2 is to get the Gran Turismo and the forces and the real racing games.

853
00:54:29,085 --> 00:54:31,454
Scott: Yeah, cuz the Nintendo doesn't have them.

854
00:54:31,755 --> 00:54:35,750
Rym: I mean f-zero was fun and it is a racing game, but it's not that kind of racing game.

855
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:42,210
Scott: Yeah, it's a different kind of racing game that you also need, you know I think burnout is the competitor for f-zero if I'm correct.

856
00:54:43,112 --> 00:55:00,310
Scott: But anyway, this is the another kind of racing game, which is sort of the off-road you know high jump in freewheeling racing game and There really wasn't one of these that was ever any good in my opinion and this one Actually a lot of people at e3 say this is the most fun Wii game they played.

857
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:05,807
Scott: So now my hopes are kind of up on this one where previously they were lukewarm.

858
00:55:06,129 --> 00:55:09,018
Rym: Yeah Now Red Steel.

859
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,265
Scott: Oh, you wanna talk about Red Steel?

860
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:11,070
Rym: I wanna talk about Red Steel.

861
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:14,063
Scott: Red Steel is the game that everyone wants to play.

862
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,349
Scott: It has the longest line at e3.

863
00:55:16,152 --> 00:55:17,939
Rym: Yeah, I mean they showed original screenshots.

864
00:55:17,959 --> 00:55:20,369
Rym: they talked about the concept and I thought all right, that looks cool.

865
00:55:21,231 --> 00:55:26,320
Rym: Now that I've seen more and more of the gameplay this game looks like it's gonna be bad ass.

866
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:33,068
Scott: It's basically an FPS where you use the wiimote to control the gun and/or the sword sword.

867
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:37,697
Scott: So our sword, yeah Link's gonna have the sword too.

868
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:40,226
Rym: Yeah, but this the game looks like.

869
00:55:40,246 --> 00:55:43,243
Rym: there's a lot of fighting But there's also a lot of like plot.

870
00:55:43,323 --> 00:55:50,990
Rym: figuring things out They said they guess a lot of people have likened it to half-life in terms of the plot is integrated into the game.

871
00:55:51,171 --> 00:55:52,889
Scott: Yeah, I didn't see that so much.

872
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:53,833
Rym: I saw that cuz.

873
00:55:53,874 --> 00:56:03,455
Rym: apparently one of the big parts of the game is if you'll be fighting like a boss and you have to Choose it like say you beat him in the sword fight and he's knocked his sword away Do you kill him or spare him?

874
00:56:03,555 --> 00:56:04,598
Rym: and then the consequences?

875
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,902
Scott: that didn't seem.

876
00:56:06,022 --> 00:56:09,756
Rym: when I saw it cuz I watch said specifically that is One of the scenarios in the game.

877
00:56:09,816 --> 00:56:14,137
Scott: Yeah, I saw the scenario in the game and it didn't look to me Like there were any plot consequences.

878
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:15,162
Scott: It was just.

879
00:56:15,624 --> 00:56:17,090
Scott: you didn't choose to do either way.

880
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:20,730
Scott: You know you the guy shot the guards and then the boss coward.

881
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:21,211
Scott: Which is it?

882
00:56:22,555 --> 00:56:23,137
Scott: it's less.

883
00:56:23,398 --> 00:56:26,086
Scott: it seemed to me like it was less a thing about plot.

884
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:27,430
Scott: I didn't see plot at all.

885
00:56:28,232 --> 00:56:33,969
Scott: it seemed to me more of the bad guys in the game act like real people as much as they can.

886
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:43,081
Scott: a Big mafia boss if you shoot his guards doesn't keep trying to kill you Like in so many games time cop, etc.

887
00:56:43,121 --> 00:56:43,563
Scott: Etc.

888
00:56:44,105 --> 00:56:45,028
Scott: The mafia boss goes.

889
00:56:45,048 --> 00:56:48,083
Scott: Oh shit This guy just hosed my guards and he carries behind the desk.

890
00:56:48,746 --> 00:56:49,570
Scott: That's what it's about.

891
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:50,735
Rym: But I've seen.

892
00:56:50,795 --> 00:56:54,330
Rym: I've seen a lot of comments from people who played it who said that it looks like it's gonna be like Half-Life.

893
00:56:54,691 --> 00:56:56,056
Rym: Many people have said those words.

894
00:56:56,277 --> 00:56:57,662
Scott: All right, we'll see I haven't seen.

895
00:56:57,702 --> 00:56:59,589
Rym: I want to play this game because I don't.

896
00:56:59,609 --> 00:56:59,750
Rym: I want.

897
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:00,377
Rym: I want to see.

898
00:57:00,397 --> 00:57:01,549
Rym: I want to see exactly what it is.

899
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,566
Scott: I think people just want it because it.

900
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:11,837
Scott: you know it's a violent FPS tight game and there aren't any other games in the same genre taking advantage of the wiimote in the same way at This time that we know about.

901
00:57:11,978 --> 00:57:19,950
Scott: well, we'll see, you know, I'm sure that later FPS runaround killing guy games will be much better than Red Steel anyway.

902
00:57:21,012 --> 00:57:23,012
Scott: Metroid Prime 3 Corruption.

903
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,677
Scott: Metroid Prime 1 was awesome.

904
00:57:24,938 --> 00:57:28,570
Scott: Metroid Prime 2 was more of the same which is awesome, but it wasn't more awesome.

905
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:32,228
Scott: Metroid Prime 3 I'm pretty sure will be more awesome.

906
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:38,290
Scott: Hooray, I'll buy every Metroid game no matter what it is pretty much except for Metroid Prime pinball.

907
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:40,722
Rym: Yeah, I was about to say you didn't buy the pinball game.

908
00:57:40,742 --> 00:57:43,895
Scott: I'm not gonna buy the pinball game Five bucks.

909
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:44,598
Scott: Okay.

910
00:57:44,618 --> 00:57:45,724
Scott: Yeah, I buy it for five bucks.

911
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:49,363
Rym: There aren't many games I wouldn't buy for five bucks that are made by Nintendo.

912
00:57:49,463 --> 00:57:53,666
Scott: Yeah, so Metroid Prime 3 is gonna be awesome.

913
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:58,440
Scott: FFCC we Not so much info on this one.

914
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,409
Scott: Yeah, but it's going to exist.

915
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:02,850
Rym: Of course, it's also supposed to exist for the DS.

916
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:06,661
Scott: Yep, I hope there's some sort of tie together.

917
00:58:06,681 --> 00:58:08,728
Rym: I really hope I would assume there will be.

918
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:09,995
Scott: There's got to be.

919
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:11,001
Rym: I mean they have.

920
00:58:11,243 --> 00:58:18,690
Rym: they've been very and in general Nintendo seems very forward-thinking about their tie togethers and they'll have tie togethers between games that were released fairly far apart.

921
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,854
Scott: Yeah, but none.

922
00:58:19,894 --> 00:58:23,588
Scott: No one is still be in the old Sonic and Knuckles tie together.

923
00:58:23,848 --> 00:58:24,250
Scott: No one.

924
00:58:26,731 --> 00:58:27,840
Scott: Resident Evil Wii.

925
00:58:27,861 --> 00:58:31,289
Rym: I Lot of people have said that that looks bad.

926
00:58:31,935 --> 00:58:33,510
Scott: Well a lot of you say the words badass.

927
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:34,875
Scott: Well, here's the thing is.

928
00:58:34,936 --> 00:58:38,189
Scott: as far as I know Resident Evil 4 people say was awesome.

929
00:58:39,691 --> 00:58:41,839
Scott: Every Resident Evil is out for the GameCube.

930
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:44,690
Scott: every single Resident Evil ever is available on the GameCube.

931
00:58:45,392 --> 00:58:48,987
Scott: Resident Evil 5 is supposedly gonna be a ps3 exclusive.

932
00:58:49,088 --> 00:58:49,490
Scott: I heard.

933
00:58:50,671 --> 00:58:54,990
Scott: But this I've seen it announced for the ps3 and I haven't seen it announced for the Wii or the GameCube.

934
00:58:56,094 --> 00:59:03,350
Scott: so The question is is Resident Evil Wii Resident Evil 5 with Wii commands or is it a different Resident Evil with Wii command?

935
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:06,084
Rym: I really think it's gonna be a different Resident Evil.

936
00:59:06,285 --> 00:59:06,829
Scott: I think it is.

937
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:10,926
Rym: It's a good move for the people who make Resident Evil because then I'll just sell more games.

938
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:15,497
Scott: Yep I Guess it's gonna be really cool.

939
00:59:15,517 --> 00:59:23,125
Scott: You know, you sneak around the house instead of you know Just the old-school way and then you shoot the zombies and zombies jump out.

940
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:29,716
Scott: and now when you're scared You know if you get scared in a Resident Evil game you go Ah, but you don't you know.

941
00:59:29,957 --> 00:59:39,167
Scott: in your ah shrieking this jiggle the controller and lose your aim But with a wiimote in your hands if you get surprised you might drop that thing on the floor or something.

942
00:59:39,268 --> 00:59:41,505
Scott: Oh my god It's gonna get really good.

943
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:43,907
Scott: Okay, two more Wii games left.

944
00:59:44,812 --> 00:59:48,609
Scott: Trauma Center we aka trauma center.

945
00:59:49,611 --> 00:59:50,294
Scott: Second opinion.

946
00:59:50,334 --> 00:59:51,037
Scott: I think it was called.

947
00:59:51,057 --> 00:59:53,869
Rym: Yeah, I think that's a really clever title really clever name.

948
00:59:54,532 --> 00:59:56,658
Scott: The first game for the DS was good.

949
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,386
Scott: It had some problems meaning it was too hard.

950
00:59:59,487 --> 01:00:00,590
Rym: It was Nintendo hard.

951
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:05,605
Scott: Yeah, so if I ever beat that one and I decide I want more of that.

952
01:00:05,986 --> 01:00:14,026
Scott: I'll get the Wii one and the last one The one that I'm looking forward to probably more than any of the others duck hunt Wii.

953
01:00:14,066 --> 01:00:17,409
Rym: Yep Now I've heard rumors that there's no dog in it.

954
01:00:18,172 --> 01:00:19,054
Scott: No, that's.

955
01:00:19,736 --> 01:00:26,016
Scott: I watched a video of it and the video which seemed to be a prototype of duck hunt We and not a complete duck hunt.

956
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:27,100
Scott: We had no dog.

957
01:00:27,321 --> 01:00:29,429
Rym: There'd better be a goddamn dog.

958
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:30,939
Scott: now Here's the thing about duck hunt.

959
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:31,201
Scott: We.

960
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:38,236
Scott: that kind of makes me go in if I'm playing duck hunt we I Really need to have a gun with sights on it.

961
01:00:38,337 --> 01:00:40,362
Scott: now at the Nintendo booth.

962
01:00:40,402 --> 01:00:43,070
Scott: There is this sort of display holster.

963
01:00:43,271 --> 01:00:49,222
Scott: They're showing where you insert the Wii controller into it and it gives it a trigger And you hold it like a gun.

964
01:00:49,906 --> 01:00:50,430
Scott: That's pretty cool.

965
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:54,368
Rym: Yeah, because a lot of people speculated that they'd make something like that and sure enough they did.

966
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:54,972
Scott: sure enough They did.

967
01:00:55,013 --> 01:00:55,416
Scott: who knows that?

968
01:00:55,456 --> 01:00:59,619
Scott: that'll be the final thing that's available But whatever I'm sure they'll test it.

969
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,830
Scott: a lot thing is the video of duck hunt.

970
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:11,963
Scott: We shows two ducks or a bunch of ducks and targets and clays flying around and two people are trying to shoot them at the Same time which is way cool because now you have competitive duck hunt.

971
01:01:12,726 --> 01:01:19,876
Scott: the thing is You see these crosshairs floating around the screen Now just watching the screen.

972
01:01:19,896 --> 01:01:23,345
Scott: I couldn't really see myself playing duck hunt that way.

973
01:01:23,365 --> 01:01:27,270
Scott: That's really hard to Use a crosshair to kill the ducks.

974
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:29,921
Scott: I really need to have a sight on the Wii controller.

975
01:01:30,142 --> 01:01:32,050
Rym: crosshairs and games like that kind of screw me up.

976
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:33,737
Scott: They screw me up big time.

977
01:01:33,778 --> 01:01:34,079
Scott: They might.

978
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,370
Scott: you know other people might be okay with it.

979
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:44,435
Scott: I might be able to get used to it but if I'm playing a gun game I need to have a sight on the gun and I need to aim at The screen though.

980
01:01:44,476 --> 01:01:45,178
Rym: We'll see.

981
01:01:45,419 --> 01:01:48,670
Rym: I mean one if it's a prototype if it changes, or if that's an option.

982
01:01:49,711 --> 01:01:50,577
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

983
01:01:51,462 --> 01:01:52,388
Scott: I just don't tell.

984
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:59,390
Scott: I Don't think the Wii sensor can figure out your screen and if you're aiming exactly at the duck.

985
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:01,940
Scott: So I don't think a sight would actually work on the device.

986
01:02:02,562 --> 01:02:03,144
Scott: That's the thing.

987
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:04,409
Rym: yeah, we'll have to see.

988
01:02:05,332 --> 01:02:07,019
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure it'll be okay.

989
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:08,625
Scott: I'll play it in a store before I buy it.

990
01:02:09,328 --> 01:02:14,304
Rym: now of course there Was the game they announced after there, oh, yeah, we should probably talk about that.

991
01:02:14,324 --> 01:02:17,479
Scott: you mean the game they announced today Last night.

992
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:25,151

01:02:26,761 --> 01:02:35,292
Scott: I don't remember when they said that Smash Brothers we or Revolution would be a launch title that would be playable online.

995
01:02:35,854 --> 01:02:40,552
Scott: at the Nintendo press conference the other day They didn't say a goddamn thing about Smash Brothers.

996
01:02:40,572 --> 01:02:41,135
Scott: not a word.

997
01:02:41,477 --> 01:02:44,249
Scott: when it was over I said where the fuck's the Smash Brothers?

998
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:45,857
Scott: you promised you promise breakers.

999
01:02:45,877 --> 01:02:49,719
Scott: you and Hey didn't break their promise.

Scott: well Actually, these are pre renders with very little gameplay, but it did show some gameplay.

1003
01:02:59,576 --> 01:02:59,817
Rym: Yep.

1004
01:03:00,118 --> 01:03:01,824
Scott: We're shown Yesterday.

1005
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:03,994
Rym: it looks like they didn't screw it up at all.

1006
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:05,400
Rym: looks like the same gameplay.

1007
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:08,246
Scott: It looks like awesome Smash Brothers.

1008
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:12,918
Scott: and of course the key to any Smash Brothers title is the new characters.

1009
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:14,565
Rym: all right They won.

1010
01:03:14,605 --> 01:03:16,112
Rym: not only there are a bunch of new characters.

1011
01:03:16,353 --> 01:03:21,513
Rym: not only is it possible There will be more characters in addition to the ones they just no no not possible.

1012
01:03:21,554 --> 01:03:23,280
Scott: guaranteed to be more characters.

1013
01:03:23,922 --> 01:03:24,985
Rym: All right all right all right fine.

1014
01:03:25,005 --> 01:03:28,957
Rym: You know what the the Smash Brothers, dude was talking like.

1015
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:32,612
Rym: yeah We've got a lot of ideas like they asked him in an interview.

1016
01:03:32,632 --> 01:03:36,668
Rym: all right if there was one character You would like you would have added to this game.

1017
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:37,472
Rym: Who would it be?

1018
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:37,953
Rym: he was like.

1019
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:39,520
Rym: we're still adding characters.

1020
01:03:40,461 --> 01:03:43,168
Rym: Yeah We would add we'd add him.

1021
01:03:43,268 --> 01:03:50,616
Scott: there is a poll going on in Japan Asking the Japanese people what characters to add and people think the poll is gonna come over here next.

1022
01:03:51,439 --> 01:03:56,512
Rym: all right if There are so many characters the thing is they got the character.

1023
01:03:56,572 --> 01:03:58,257
Rym: I wanted the most okay.

1024
01:03:58,277 --> 01:04:00,228
Scott: Let's start with Meta Knight.

1025
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:01,640
Rym: Meta Knight is awesome.

1026
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:04,370
Scott: If you don't know who Meta Knight is you've never played Kirby.

1027
01:04:04,832 --> 01:04:15,260
Scott: Meta Knight is basically this little guy Who is the same shape of Kirby, but he's a knight like with a sword And I don't think he has a shield, but he has a mask and he's really badass.

1028
01:04:16,321 --> 01:04:17,895
Scott: So that's gonna be awesome.

1029
01:04:17,915 --> 01:04:26,000
Rym: that guy yes Pitts Pitt from Kid Icarus a game that is mostly forgotten to Nintendo fans.

1030
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:43,629
Scott: No, this is a game that is very remembered among Nintendo fans but has been neglected just as Metroid was for a while just as Earthbound was and it seems that Nintendo has this trend of a game is long lost and forgotten by Seemingly long lost and forgotten by Nintendo.

1031
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:46,760
Scott: the fans are still desperate for more of this game.

1032
01:04:47,162 --> 01:04:51,060
Scott: They put the character in Smash Brothers, then they released the actual games.

1033
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:54,100
Scott: They put Roy and Marth in Smash Brothers, and they came up with Fire Emblem.

1034
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:57,376
Scott: I would put Samus in Smash Brothers the camel of Metroid Prime.

1035
01:04:57,436 --> 01:04:58,180
Rym: I would bet money.

1036
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:00,599
Rym: There's going to be a new Kid Icarus game on the Wii.

1037
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:04,215
Scott: There's got to be a Kid Icarus game on the Wii where you use the Wiimote to shoot arrows.

1038
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,460
Rym: That's gonna be so awesome.

1039
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:06,484
Scott: It's gonna happen.

1040
01:05:06,525 --> 01:05:07,308
Scott: I can guarantee it.

1041
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:13,331
Rym: Kid Icarus is one of my favorite old games even though I'm not gonna pretend Kid Icarus was hard as fuck.

1042
01:05:13,432 --> 01:05:14,937
Rym: It was harder than holy crap.

1043
01:05:14,997 --> 01:05:15,740
Scott: is that game hard?

1044
01:05:15,961 --> 01:05:19,540
Rym: I never ever beat it legitimately from start to finish.

1045
01:05:19,801 --> 01:05:21,808
Scott: It was just barely beat the first couple levels.

1046
01:05:21,868 --> 01:05:24,075
Rym: legitimately I can get to level 2 - 4. whoa.

1047
01:05:26,281 --> 01:05:27,911
Scott: We should play it and we should good at it.

1048
01:05:27,931 --> 01:05:28,313
Rym: We should.

1049
01:05:28,534 --> 01:05:29,520
Rym: I've tried to get good at it.

1050
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:31,548
Rym: You can't with those freaking gravis game pads.

1051
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:31,950
Rym: We have.

1052
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,817
Scott: we'll go get some Xbox controllers.

1053
01:05:33,877 --> 01:05:38,573
Rym: Yeah We're gonna buy an Xbox controller to play an emulation of an NES game.

1054
01:05:38,593 --> 01:05:40,218
Scott: I find that we'll get an Xbox 360 also.

1055
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,873
Scott: Maybe we'll be able to play Kid Icarus in the virtual console on our Wii.

1056
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:45,740
Rym: You know what I guarantee we will all right.

1057
01:05:46,103 --> 01:05:58,719
Rym: oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I Got one thing to say about this because actually Scott when there was a quiz on sprites a while ago He did not recognize a character who was from Kid Icarus, which I thought was a travesty.

1058
01:05:59,503 --> 01:06:09,240
Rym: I note that if Pitt is in Super Smash Brothers, I Guarantee I guarantee there is going to be an eggplant wizard somewhere in Super Smash Brothers doing something bad.

1059
01:06:09,621 --> 01:06:10,143
Scott: We'll see.

1060
01:06:10,445 --> 01:06:12,754
Rym: there is going to be some sort of someone gets turned into an egg.

1061
01:06:12,774 --> 01:06:14,079
Scott: Maybe there'll be an eggplant item.

1062
01:06:15,102 --> 01:06:16,352
Rym: That would be awesome.

1063
01:06:16,675 --> 01:06:22,971
Scott: All right Samus without her suit on is now a character in Smash Brothers brawl.

1064
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:25,900
Rym: Yeah, it's uh, it's hot real hot.

1065
01:06:26,285 --> 01:06:29,572
Scott: I think that might be my new favorite Character to use because they used to use Samus.

1066
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:33,230
Rym: now you Samus without a suit plus Samus without a suit the way that I mean.

1067
01:06:33,471 --> 01:06:37,910
Rym: they showed us straight up what she looks like this time And this is the cloak like the best representation of.

1068
01:06:38,031 --> 01:06:40,400
Scott: we always knew what she looked like since the first Metroid.

1069
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:42,450
Rym: Yeah, but that was such a pixely.

1070
01:06:42,651 --> 01:06:44,640
Rym: All right, it's a barely recognizable.

1071
01:06:44,841 --> 01:06:49,440
Scott: So you play Metroid 2 and you see what she looks like and you play Metroid Super Metroid and you see the same.

1072
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,628
Scott: Yeah, it's the same but now it's good.

1073
01:06:51,709 --> 01:06:52,271
Rym: It's really good.

1074
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:54,600
Scott: And then we saw in every other Metroid game what she looks like.

1075
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:56,006
Scott: There's no mystery about it.

1076
01:06:56,147 --> 01:06:57,292
Rym: I never saw any of those Metro.

1077
01:06:57,352 --> 01:06:58,336
Rym: I never played any of those.

1078
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,220
Scott: Well, then you suck.

1079
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,486
Rym: I actually don't like Metroid games.

1080
01:07:00,526 --> 01:07:02,617
Scott: every single Metroid game shows you what she looks like.

1081
01:07:02,657 --> 01:07:05,349
Scott: in some way I beat much like maybe Metroid pinball.

1082
01:07:05,429 --> 01:07:07,980
Scott: I don't even know because I haven't played the only one I've seen of hers.

1083
01:07:08,141 --> 01:07:11,102
Rym: I saw her in Metroid 1 and That's it.

1084
01:07:11,544 --> 01:07:13,993
Rym: I never really played any other Metroid until I got the DS one.

1085
01:07:14,495 --> 01:07:15,880
Scott: Well, she's all over the place.

1086
01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:17,839
Rym: I've been playing on zero mission.

1087
01:07:18,841 --> 01:07:19,464
Rym: That's about it.

1088
01:07:19,826 --> 01:07:26,297
Rym: Yep, which is the same as Metroid 1 plus a little bit She had some kind of lightsaber II sword thing that looked cool in the in the FMV.

1089
01:07:26,317 --> 01:07:27,823
Scott: Yeah I don't know what that's about.

1090
01:07:27,883 --> 01:07:29,551
Scott: Maybe it'll be in Metroid Prime 3.

1091
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:31,298
Scott: Yeah, gotta throw a sword into every game.

1092
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:34,497
Scott: now that we have We mote gotta put a sword in every game.

1093
01:07:35,121 --> 01:07:36,146
Scott: People love swinging sword.

1094
01:07:36,206 --> 01:07:40,824
Rym: at some point is gonna be Luke and Darth Vader fighting and it's gonna be awesome At some point.

1095
01:07:40,844 --> 01:07:41,085
Scott: Yes.

1096
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:41,827
Scott: I'll be Darth Vader.

1097
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:43,332
Rym: I'll be Darth Vader.

1098
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:45,560
Rym: Screw you me Darth Vader versus Darth Vader.

1099
01:07:45,741 --> 01:07:50,055
Scott: I'll have to use my nunchuck to give you the you know neck grip of death.

1100
01:07:50,637 --> 01:07:56,600
Scott: All right, so then Wario Wario it might be hard to resist using Wario.

1101
01:07:56,901 --> 01:08:00,672
Rym: Yeah, because not only do they show him a farting in the video.

1102
01:08:00,732 --> 01:08:10,033
Rym: Not only did Scott just fart in my room But in the interview with the Smash Brothers guy They asked the question so is Wario gonna have his fart power?

1103
01:08:10,073 --> 01:08:15,549
Rym: and the answer I believe was of course Somebody asked yeah, where is he?

1104
01:08:15,589 --> 01:08:19,685
Scott: when I have a lot of Wario games and I'm a big Wario fan When does Wario fart?

1105
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:21,173
Rym: He farts a lot in.

1106
01:08:21,193 --> 01:08:22,037
Rym: Wario were touched.

1107
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:28,459
Rym: I know that And I think in some of these story things in the GameCube one it shows him farting.

1108
01:08:28,781 --> 01:08:30,029
Scott: Oh, I never played that GameCube one.

1109
01:08:30,049 --> 01:08:31,437
Scott: I heard it was actually kind of bad.

1110
01:08:31,598 --> 01:08:32,363
Rym: Oh, yeah I don't know.

1111
01:08:32,384 --> 01:08:33,877
Scott: I got to go play it and find out.

1112
01:08:35,024 --> 01:08:36,953
Scott: It's probably really cheap now, but you'll get it cuz.

1113
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:42,953
Rym: they also asked in the interview Does Samus suitless Samus have any fart power?

1114
01:08:43,576 --> 01:08:44,460
Rym: and then everyone laughed?

1115
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:50,613
Scott: Okay, I think that's it for the Wii, um now there's one more character.

1116
01:08:50,654 --> 01:08:51,416
Rym: now the video.

1117
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:52,479
Scott: right the video.

1118
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,759
Rym: They showed and I have a sad anecdote from my work about this.

1119
01:08:56,602 --> 01:09:01,779
Rym: But they showed the video of all these characters and then it ended but the lights didn't come on.

1120
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:15,836
Rym: And then it showed Some Metal Gear action of like Solid Snake talking to someone on the radio as Solid Snake is wanted And then it shows Solid Snake in his box in Smash Brothers.

1121
01:09:15,876 --> 01:09:17,399
Rym: And yes, he's a character in Smash Brothers.

1122
01:09:17,682 --> 01:09:18,769
Scott: Oh my god, Solid Snake.

1123
01:09:19,051 --> 01:09:24,496
Rym: apparently this isn't a matter they had people asked a lot like so did you ask Kojima or how did this happen?

1124
01:09:24,857 --> 01:09:25,359
Rym: and they were like.

1125
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:28,636
Rym: Kojima begged us to have him in the first one for the GameCube.

1126
01:09:28,676 --> 01:09:31,974
Rym: It was just too late So we promised we'd put it in the next one and now we did.

1127
01:09:31,993 --> 01:09:33,241
Rym: oh my god Like.

1128
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:36,700
Rym: they wanted Solid Snake in it and Kojima wanted Solid Snake in it.

1129
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:45,348
Rym: no one involved did not want Solid Snake in this game and The best part is that at work There's this one guy at work whose son is really interested.

1130
01:09:45,488 --> 01:09:46,352
Scott: who's Solid Snake.

1131
01:09:46,913 --> 01:09:48,479
Scott: I said, why is that guy in a box?

1132
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:52,635
Rym: I said hit Solid Snake and Meta Knight are the new characters of Smash Brothers.

1133
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:53,519
Rym: and he said who?

1134
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,288
Rym: Yeah, and I said pit from Kid Icarus.

1135
01:09:56,348 --> 01:09:59,040
Rym: He said what I said, you probably don't know who Meta Knight is.

1136
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:02,453
Rym: He said no, and then I said Solid Snake, you know Metal Gear Solid.

1137
01:10:02,473 --> 01:10:06,523
Rym: and he said, oh you mean snake Solid Snake.

1138
01:10:07,185 --> 01:10:13,766
Rym: these newfangled kids have no I they don't recognize him as Solid Snake because in the games The voice acting.

1139
01:10:13,786 --> 01:10:14,790
Rym: they just call him snake.

1140
01:10:14,891 --> 01:10:17,060
Rym: Usually they don't call him Solid Snake every time.

1141
01:10:17,902 --> 01:10:20,880
Rym: So when I said Solid Snake had no idea who was the other guy Super Joe?

1142
01:10:22,502 --> 01:10:24,491
Scott: No, who's the guy the other gray Fox?

1143
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:25,676
Rym: No boss.

1144
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:26,440
Scott: There's a third.

1145
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,414
Scott: It was a fourth guy from which game?

1146
01:10:28,495 --> 01:10:30,563
Scott: Metal Gear 1 Metal Gear 1.

1147
01:10:30,563 --> 01:10:31,546
Rym: there's a whole bunch of guys.

1148
01:10:31,908 --> 01:10:33,212
Scott: There's another guy with a funny name.

1149
01:10:33,252 --> 01:10:33,935
Scott: I forget his name.

1150
01:10:34,015 --> 01:10:38,686
Scott: They all have funny names I know But there's one in particular that I like.

1151
01:10:39,288 --> 01:10:40,692
Rym: I forget the ocelot guy.

1152
01:10:41,053 --> 01:10:42,056
Scott: No, he's not in solid one.

1153
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:43,180
Scott: He's in solid one.

1154
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:45,707
Scott: Yeah, not regular machine gun.

1155
01:10:45,727 --> 01:10:47,030
Rym: What's his name Billy?

1156
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:48,795
Scott: I think no forget it.

1157
01:10:49,256 --> 01:10:51,483
Rym: Yeah big boss I didn't like so much.

1158
01:10:51,784 --> 01:10:52,487
Scott: No big boss.

1159
01:10:52,527 --> 01:10:52,808
Scott: No good.

1160
01:10:53,129 --> 01:10:53,952
Scott: He was a bastard.

1161
01:10:54,173 --> 01:10:54,334
Scott: Yep.

1162
01:10:55,036 --> 01:10:56,020
Scott: One last thing about the Wii.

1163
01:10:56,403 --> 01:11:05,391
Scott: I just saw a video online Where a guy took a camera and went from the beginning to the end of the line To for all the people waiting to use a Wii.

1164
01:11:05,592 --> 01:11:07,338
Rym: we have two things to say about this video.

1165
01:11:07,418 --> 01:11:10,780
Scott: number one The line was insanely long.

1166
01:11:10,981 --> 01:11:16,180
Rym: The video is over two minutes long and it moves and kind of fast-forward walking down the line.

1167
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:19,149
Scott: Yeah, so it's a long line.

1168
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:20,072
Scott: See it for yourself.

1169
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:22,440
Scott: Just search go on YouTube and search for a Wii line.

1170
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,047
Scott: Maybe I'll put it on the forum.

1171
01:11:24,389 --> 01:11:29,828
Rym: number two the sheer number of DS's seen in the line is staggering.

1172
01:11:29,848 --> 01:11:32,056
Scott: there are probably more DS's in the line.

1173
01:11:32,297 --> 01:11:33,079
Scott: then there were wheeze.

1174
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,244
Scott: They were waiting to play.

1175
01:11:34,264 --> 01:11:38,218
Rym: there are probably more DS's in line than there are people at every other booth at e3.

1176
01:11:39,303 --> 01:11:41,915
Scott: No, I don't think so at any given at any booth.

1177
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,128
Rym: I Could make a semantic argument at any little booth.

1178
01:11:45,429 --> 01:11:45,690
Rym: Yeah.

1179
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:48,300
Scott: Yeah, and I didn't see a single PSP in a line.

1180
01:11:48,861 --> 01:11:50,714
Rym: Of course, it was hard to tell for sure.

1181
01:11:50,734 --> 01:11:51,439
Rym: It was hard.

1182
01:11:51,923 --> 01:11:53,171
Rym: PSPs are all black and stealthy.

1183
01:11:53,191 --> 01:11:53,976
Rym: We might not have seen it.

1184
01:11:54,117 --> 01:11:54,640
Scott: That is true.

1185
01:11:54,761 --> 01:11:56,892
Scott: There could have been PSPs in the line that we're hiding.

1186
01:11:57,515 --> 01:11:58,420
Rym: However, it's weird.

1187
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,433
Rym: You can you let's think you can tell the DS people because there's always.

1188
01:12:01,453 --> 01:12:15,554
Scott: you didn't even need to know they had DS's because you see six guys standing in a circle facing each other with their shoulders hunched Shoulders up and their hands up near their torsos and you know They all have DS's and they're playing Mario Kart slash Tetris slash something.

1189
01:12:15,575 --> 01:12:16,377
Rym: Yep, and we paused.

1190
01:12:16,418 --> 01:12:17,040
Rym: it wants to check in.

1191
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,806
Rym: Yep, look the DS is all around.

1192
01:12:19,227 --> 01:12:21,594
Rym: Yep, but seriously this line.

1193
01:12:21,614 --> 01:12:22,598
Scott: No god.

1194
01:12:22,618 --> 01:12:23,340
Scott: This line was long.

1195
01:12:23,842 --> 01:12:27,736
Rym: I've stood in shorter lines to ride crazy new roller coasters at Cedar Point.

1196
01:12:27,857 --> 01:12:30,589
Scott: to be perfectly honest No matter how much I want to use the Wii.

1197
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:32,540
Scott: I wouldn't have waited in that line.

1198
01:12:33,242 --> 01:12:42,450
Scott: I would have gone and with like a little binocular to get looks at all the games from far away and I wouldn't have actually gone to use a Wii.

1199
01:12:42,511 --> 01:12:47,980
Scott: I might have gone to use some DS's and the Nintendo booth and Go look at the other things in the Nintendo booth.

1200
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:51,238
Rym: I would have been like that one guy who said I'm just gonna do everything else at e3.

1201
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:53,530
Scott: Yep Absolutely everything else.

1202
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:59,620
Scott: plus if I went to e3 The stuff that I would want to look at the most isn't the major stuff that you're gonna see on the internet.

1203
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:08,985
Scott: It's all that little stuff in the back alleys with all the independent developers that you'll never ever ever see coverage of anywhere All the secret stuff.

1204
01:13:09,226 --> 01:13:13,960
Rym: That's why you're not gonna go see Paris Hilton talking about her new game her new cell phone game.

1205
01:13:14,063 --> 01:13:16,909
Scott: Yeah Okay, let's talk about Microsoft.

1206
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,939
Rym: All right, they put out a surprisingly good show.

1207
01:13:19,241 --> 01:13:29,698
Scott: yeah, I thought that Microsoft was going to just announce a bunch of new games like Halo 3 and shit and That would be that because their consoles already out and it's already done.

1208
01:13:30,881 --> 01:13:34,513
Scott: First everyone expected they announced the HD DVD player.

1209
01:13:34,553 --> 01:13:43,380
Scott: They didn't say how much it's gonna cost or anything But it's gonna be an HD DVD player that you can buy and plug into your Xbox 360 to watch HD DVDs.

1210
01:13:43,641 --> 01:13:50,480
Rym: Yep, there's been speculation that'll be between a hundred and maybe two hundred dollars at most which is cheaper than an HD DVD player.

1211
01:13:50,721 --> 01:13:52,326
Scott: But of course you have to add the price of a 360.

1212
01:13:52,326 --> 01:13:56,620
Rym: the thing is that's still cheaper than an HD DVD player.

1213
01:13:57,041 --> 01:14:07,573
Scott: Well, the thing is if you already have a 360 from last year and the HD DVD player comes out holiday season this year If you're looking and you already have a 360, are you gonna buy a ps3?

1214
01:14:07,613 --> 01:14:09,580
Scott: Are you gonna buy the HD DVD player?

1215
01:14:10,783 --> 01:14:13,580
Rym: Wait a minute is the chance blu-ray will succeed and then you have to buy it.

1216
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,268
Scott: Anyway, there is also a chance.

1217
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:25,380
Scott: maybe Microsoft will release new 360s that have HD DVD players built in instead which I think would be really smart of them to do like starting next year.

1218
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:32,734
Scott: Right, you know making the new premium bundle have the HD DVD player Because by then the price of HD DVD will come down a lot.

1219
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:39,460
Scott: then bring the old Premium down in price and then I would buy the old premium at that point because I don't need an HD DVD player.

1220
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,509
Scott: You know That's not something they said they would do.

1221
01:14:42,529 --> 01:14:44,099
Scott: that's something I said they should do just now.

1222
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:48,720
Rym: Yeah, but anyway the the game the list of games that they came out with in addition to all the other stuff.

1223
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:55,000
Rym: It really is enough for us to at least for me to consider when the second gen of the Xbox 360.

1224
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,610
Scott: Well, one of those games was kind of bled.

1225
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:58,292
Scott: but we'll get to that.

1226
01:14:58,573 --> 01:15:00,440
Scott: Let's talk about the rest of the system stuff first.

1227
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,140
Scott: All right There's gonna be a camera sort of like the eye toy.

1228
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:06,326
Scott: Now what's the use of that?

1229
01:15:06,787 --> 01:15:10,200
Scott: Well, obviously they could potentially make eye toy like games.

1230
01:15:10,682 --> 01:15:15,180
Rym: Obviously when I'm playing Halo there will be a picture of my penis on my guy.

1231
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:17,073
Scott: Obviously, no, it's a video.

1232
01:15:17,094 --> 01:15:17,740
Scott: It's like a webcam.

1233
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:21,874
Scott: So as you're playing Halo people, you know, you push the button to talk.

1234
01:15:22,094 --> 01:15:23,480
Scott: people can see you talking.

1235
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:26,127
Rym: We'll see how well that gets used.

1236
01:15:26,247 --> 01:15:30,639
Rym: how many people are just gonna be naked or the cameras pointing at a penis, you know It's gonna be awesome.

1237
01:15:32,649 --> 01:15:35,386
Scott: a Wireless headset now.

1238
01:15:35,688 --> 01:15:42,624
Scott: right now the headset for the Xbox 360 I think is wired and it's kind of you know It's like a big headset.

1239
01:15:43,186 --> 01:15:47,560
Scott: this thing looks more like one of the Bluetooth headsets for a cell phone.

1240
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:50,196
Scott: We're just goes on one ear and a little tiny microphone.

1241
01:15:50,216 --> 01:15:50,820
Rym: Yeah, it's cool.

1242
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:55,920
Rym: It's not anything special or innovative in and of itself, but it's definitely the next step in terms of technology.

1243
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:03,120
Scott: It's a significant improvement to the current Xbox 360 headset and the headset is very key to the Xbox Live experience.

1244
01:16:03,382 --> 01:16:06,200
Rym: Yes, I mean for whatever anyone has to say about Microsoft.

1245
01:16:06,902 --> 01:16:09,251
Rym: Xbox Live is a very slick thing.

1246
01:16:09,532 --> 01:16:10,375
Scott: Yeah, very slick.

1247
01:16:10,757 --> 01:16:15,320
Rym: I mean I Early on I remember, you know Microsoft is making a console.

1248
01:16:16,961 --> 01:16:21,735
Rym: Yeah, I was the same way and even penny arcade were like Microsoft is making a console.

1249
01:16:21,815 --> 01:16:22,296
Scott: Oh my god.

1250
01:16:22,336 --> 01:16:23,600
Scott: This thing is gigantic.

1251
01:16:24,023 --> 01:16:25,494
Scott: Controllers are terrible.

1252
01:16:25,655 --> 01:16:26,340
Scott: Oh my god.

1253
01:16:27,201 --> 01:16:31,600
Rym: But really the Xbox Live is cool and it's pretty well done.

1254
01:16:32,242 --> 01:16:40,194
Scott: Yeah, I like the in the original Xbox and currently there really aren't so many games I want to play besides the racing games for it.

1255
01:16:40,656 --> 01:16:50,020
Scott: Yeah, but The way Xbox Live works it, you know It's sort of like the Nintendo Wi-Fi and that just having it there really adds a lot to the games.

1256
01:16:50,887 --> 01:16:54,547
Scott: But it seemed to me like the ps3 Internet thing.

1257
01:16:54,668 --> 01:17:09,160
Scott: might you know be similar but from what it looked like that was more of a push for Sony's content their movies and music and They did a lot more of that and a lot less of the gaming type stuff.

1258
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,685
Rym: Yeah, Sony really hyped up the.

1259
01:17:10,725 --> 01:17:14,737
Rym: you'll be able to download things to your Pia or your ps3 to watch.

1260
01:17:15,058 --> 01:17:19,814
Scott: Yep Well Microsoft supposedly is gonna have downloadable HD movie type stuff too.

1261
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:20,215
Rym: Yeah.

1262
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:25,702
Rym: Well, my analysis is this SOE Sony online entertainment is Crap.

1263
01:17:25,943 --> 01:17:28,934
Scott: Well Sony online entertainment is the company that does ever quest.

1264
01:17:29,014 --> 01:17:36,336
Rym: that has nothing to do with the PlayStation Yeah, but they will have something to do possibly with the online functionality the ps3.

1265
01:17:36,436 --> 01:17:37,098
Scott: No one said that.

1266
01:17:37,118 --> 01:17:39,245
Scott: where you getting there from I'll find the link there.

1267
01:17:39,265 --> 01:17:41,795
Rym: Someone was talking about the developers from them or something.

1268
01:17:41,855 --> 01:17:51,940
Scott: Maybe they're making an MMO That'll be on the ps3 because all Sony online entertainment does is make MMOs Like Star Wars galaxies and ever quest and shit and they got to make an MMO for this thing.

1269
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,027
Scott: Maybe probably but I don't.

1270
01:17:54,248 --> 01:17:57,560
Scott: no one said they have anything to do with the Sony internet ness.

1271
01:17:57,841 --> 01:17:59,448
Rym: I think it was a comment on slashdot.

1272
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:01,517
Scott: Maybe someone doesn't know what they're talking about.

1273
01:18:01,537 --> 01:18:02,180
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

1274
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:02,902
Scott: Alright.

1275
01:18:02,922 --> 01:18:07,737
Scott: now here's the best thing about the Xbox 360 in Scott's opinion the best thing.

1276
01:18:07,797 --> 01:18:08,680
Scott: remember how they were taught.

1277
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,207
Scott: I was talking about how all I really want is racing games.

1278
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:15,439
Scott: They got this official Xbox 360 wireless wheel coming it.

1279
01:18:16,973 --> 01:18:25,900
Scott: It's cool It's a really really good racing wheel and most systems in the past have had racing wheels that you could buy.

1280
01:18:26,962 --> 01:18:32,000
Scott: The problem is is that the racing wheels are almost always third-party the GameCube and PlayStation.

1281
01:18:32,181 --> 01:18:34,770
Scott: I think those actually a logitech racing wheel.

1282
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:46,079
Scott: that was labeled the official racing wheel But it's still a third-party product The kind of useless and crap or not really well-tuned and not every game supports it properly.

1283
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:57,939
Scott: but Microsoft releasing an official racing wheel is gonna mean that the major racing games which are Forza and Project Gotham and some others are going to support this wheel properly now.

1284
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:01,611
Rym: This is big because I like I like realistic racing games.

1285
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:04,279
Rym: Forza is very realistic as it is.

1286
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:10,400
Rym: If they have a wheel that is calibrated to that game and the developers made the game with that wheel in mind.

1287
01:19:10,983 --> 01:19:11,646
Rym: That's gold.

1288
01:19:11,988 --> 01:19:12,772
Rym: It's gold Jerry.

1289
01:19:13,053 --> 01:19:13,314
Scott: Yep.

1290
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:13,475
Scott: Now.

1291
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:14,440
Scott: Here's the thing about the wheel.

1292
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:21,452
Scott: It's like a typical racing wheel you clamp it down to a table, but you don't need to Plug it in to your system or anything.

1293
01:19:21,492 --> 01:19:22,075
Scott: It's wireless.

1294
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:23,200
Rym: Oh wireless.

1295
01:19:23,682 --> 01:19:25,168
Scott: I think it might need a battery or two.

1296
01:19:25,188 --> 01:19:27,960
Rym: It'll have to because it's I almost guarantee it'll have force feedback.

1297
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,440
Scott: Yeah, well, here's the thing about the force feedback.

1298
01:19:30,587 --> 01:19:33,749
Scott: All right It will rumble and whatnot with just the battery.

1299
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:41,160
Scott: and there are pedals too that are also wireless and I guess those need a battery As well if you wanted to have actual force feedback.

1300
01:19:42,221 --> 01:19:47,240
Scott: Right now people are saying you need to plug it into a power outlet to get the force feedback to work.

1301
01:19:47,342 --> 01:19:56,638
Scott: No, that's a minus But at least you don't have to plug it into the system Which means you can still sit all the way across the room as long as there's an outlet on your side of the room and At least that is optional.

1302
01:19:57,341 --> 01:20:01,900
Scott: Yep, so if you can't find an outlet near you you can still drive.

1303
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,569
Scott: You just won't have your awesome force feed watch.

1304
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:04,935
Rym: your house doesn't have the holes.

1305
01:20:05,398 --> 01:20:06,460
Scott: the holes Jerry.

1306
01:20:08,581 --> 01:20:09,826
Rym: It's been Seinfeld day for us.

1307
01:20:09,867 --> 01:20:11,132
Rym: We've just been making some of course.

1308
01:20:11,172 --> 01:20:13,100
Scott: He made the same holes joke two or three times.

1309
01:20:13,422 --> 01:20:15,600
Rym: Yeah, we made it during the day all day holes jokes.

1310
01:20:15,761 --> 01:20:20,260
Scott: So Scott is all about the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3 for racing games.

1311
01:20:20,681 --> 01:20:24,334
Scott: The Xbox 360 looks to be the cheaper more realistic solution.

1312
01:20:24,535 --> 01:20:25,840
Scott: and now it has a racing wheel.

1313
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:28,550
Scott: Yeah, plus plus plus for Scott now.

1314
01:20:28,611 --> 01:20:30,880
Rym: There's also a lot of talk about this shadow run game.

1315
01:20:31,761 --> 01:20:36,200
Scott: We're not getting to the shadow run game yet, why not cuz we're not done talking about this system.

1316
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:36,926
Scott: What else is there?

1317
01:20:36,946 --> 01:20:38,640
Rym: I didn't see anything else that I didn't.

1318
01:20:40,283 --> 01:20:45,079
Rym: You didn't look at other stuff cuz I didn't care about much beyond racing games and shadow run.

1319
01:20:45,139 --> 01:20:47,974
Scott: Yeah Well, there's gonna be this thing called live anywhere.

1320
01:20:47,994 --> 01:20:48,095
Scott: where?

1321
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,831
Scott: Xbox live will not just be for the Xbox.

1322
01:20:53,012 --> 01:20:55,080
Scott: It's actually Microsoft Live, I guess.

1323
01:20:55,321 --> 01:20:57,147
Scott: Oh, no, Microsoft Live is that other thing?

1324
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:58,211
Scott: I don't know.

1325
01:20:58,311 --> 01:20:59,214
Rym: So what are they gonna call it?

1326
01:20:59,656 --> 01:21:07,840
Scott: It's called live anywhere And what it's gonna do is basically integrate your live account across your phone and your Windows Vista computer and everything.

1327
01:21:09,162 --> 01:21:17,689
Scott: And what they showed using this was that they were gonna do simultaneous releases of you know the same game on Vista and the Xbox at the same time

1328
01:21:17,709 --> 01:21:17,909
Rym: and

1329
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:25,260
Scott: The things they talked about were people playing Halo 2 on the computer and on the Xbox competing against each other.

1330
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:32,481
Rym: Well, that's the end of people playing FPS is on the console because the PC people just kick their asses with the keyboard and a Mouse.

1331
01:21:32,923 --> 01:21:33,987
Scott: well, they said.

1332
01:21:34,007 --> 01:21:38,880
Scott: in fact, this is a quote from the Microsoft guy will settle What's better the keyboard mouse?

1333
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:40,726
Scott: Once and for all.

1334
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:47,920
Scott: and they showed a screen where you know as a list of guys Joining a game and some of them had PC icons and some of them at Xbox icons.

1335
01:21:48,502 --> 01:21:53,805
Scott: hmm, it seems like Microsoft is really going to Integrate its.

1336
01:21:54,126 --> 01:22:01,040
Scott: you know, the Xbox is pretty much going to be a Windows gaming machine and Vista is also going to be capable of being a Windows gaming.

1337
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:07,660
Rym: Well from a business perspective, they really have to do something like this because despite the fact that the Xbox does really well It does lose some money.

1338
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:18,772
Rym: I mean if they sunk a lot of money in R&D into the Xbox Franchise the one the first one at least yeah, and the second one will probably make money because now it's the second gen is popular But they're still subsidizing the hardware most likely.

1339
01:22:18,792 --> 01:22:21,604
Rym: Well, everyone's subsidize the hardware Yeah, but they may be.

1340
01:22:21,886 --> 01:22:24,296
Rym: I mean there's speculation that they make the money back games.

1341
01:22:24,376 --> 01:22:25,300
Scott: It's a razor blade deal.

1342
01:22:25,522 --> 01:22:30,734
Rym: But as far as Vista There's a lot of talk that Vista isn't going to do so.

1343
01:22:30,794 --> 01:22:35,459
Rym: well for a number I mean the corporations aren't really jumping over themselves to get this thing.

1344
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:38,730
Scott: Well, here's the thing PC games are kind of going Blair.

1345
01:22:39,252 --> 01:22:40,938
Scott: All right, we've talked about this before.

1346
01:22:41,058 --> 01:22:43,064
Scott: Yep People like me.

1347
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:48,660
Scott: Oh and a lot of other people are going to max and they're going to Linux because Windows is kind of Blair.

1348
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:55,500
Scott: But the only thing we really want Windows 4 is the games and so we keep Windows around for those games.

1349
01:22:56,221 --> 01:23:06,447
Scott: Super hardcore gamer guys are always gonna do the super PC game thing with two video cards and crazy processors and Alienware machines Just because there's no way.

1350
01:23:06,567 --> 01:23:08,272
Rym: Alienware you mean Dell machines.

1351
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:09,055
Scott: All right.

1352
01:23:09,075 --> 01:23:14,536
Scott: Yeah, Dell XPS machines Which is actually what Microsoft used or had on stage for their demos.

1353
01:23:14,596 --> 01:23:18,703
Scott: Yeah What Was I saying?

1354
01:23:19,245 --> 01:23:27,372
Scott: right because the PC will always have better graphics it'll always a better frame rate It'll always have all that stuff for all those games.

1355
01:23:27,994 --> 01:23:29,940
Scott: and that's what this ultra hardcore guys do.

1356
01:23:30,061 --> 01:23:30,323
Scott: I mean.

1357
01:23:30,746 --> 01:23:32,520
Scott: who's the most famous gamer in the world?

1358
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,145
Scott: What's his name Thresh?

1359
01:23:35,546 --> 01:23:36,288
Scott: No, no, no.

1360
01:23:36,569 --> 01:23:38,375
Scott: the fatality guy Wow.

1361
01:23:38,495 --> 01:23:39,237
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

1362
01:23:39,257 --> 01:23:40,180
Scott: Yeah, and what does he do?

1363
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,324
Scott: He plays PC games.

1364
01:23:41,364 --> 01:23:44,376
Scott: He doesn't play Nintendo games or PlayStation games or Xbox games.

1365
01:23:44,496 --> 01:23:45,440
Scott: plays PC games.

1366
01:23:45,661 --> 01:23:47,634
Rym: To me the most famous gamer is I eat poo.

1367
01:23:48,258 --> 01:23:53,053
Rym: Yeah I heard he got knocked off the top.

1368
01:23:53,435 --> 01:23:54,259
Rym: Yeah, someone beat him.

1369
01:23:54,705 --> 01:24:03,000
Scott: Oh, no but I mean look if you look around the world to consoles are really big in Japan in the US and Different consoles are big in different parts of the world.

1370
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:06,631
Scott: But console South Korea is pretty much PC game land.

1371
01:24:06,751 --> 01:24:08,015
Scott: China PC game land.

1372
01:24:08,095 --> 01:24:09,579
Scott: Europe mostly PC game land.

1373
01:24:10,141 --> 01:24:11,890
Rym: South America Sega Genesis land.

1374
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:13,819
Scott: Yeah, China PC game land.

1375
01:24:14,643 --> 01:24:35,080
Scott: PC games are big internationally and Microsoft is doing two things that are really helping this out People like us who really like PC games But don't have windows anymore and there aren't enough PC games to really justify us having a Windows PC that cost a hajillion dollars.

1376
01:24:35,702 --> 01:24:40,520
Scott: The Xbox 360 is becoming the just Windows games machine now.

1377
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:44,714
Rym: This is part of the reason I'm really thinking about getting one as time goes on.

1378
01:24:45,095 --> 01:24:46,520
Scott: Yeah, it's not something I'll get right away.

1379
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:49,237
Scott: It's maybe something we'll get on the first price drop or two.

1380
01:24:50,063 --> 01:24:55,297
Scott: You know, I mean if I get a Wii and Rym gets into 360 Then it'll be fair deal unlike when I got a GameCube and he got a nothing.

1381
01:24:55,659 --> 01:24:57,285
Rym: Yeah Yeah thing is I don't.

1382
01:24:57,305 --> 01:25:01,500
Rym: I don't know if I would buy an Xbox unless we're in 50/50 because it's still a lot of money.

1383
01:25:02,003 --> 01:25:02,486
Rym: I'm cheap.

1384
01:25:02,908 --> 01:25:03,794
Rym: I'm a cheap bastard.

1385
01:25:03,935 --> 01:25:11,546
Rym: You are real cheap But the point is my investment into the Wii is going to consist of me buying myself a controller Like I did for the GameCube.

1386
01:25:11,586 --> 01:25:12,992
Rym: I have my controller and that's it.

1387
01:25:13,434 --> 01:25:14,257
Scott: Mine's gonna be green.

1388
01:25:14,277 --> 01:25:15,827
Rym: now Mine's gonna be green.

1389
01:25:15,888 --> 01:25:17,380
Scott: Well, we're gonna get confused, aren't we?

1390
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:21,179
Scott: But the other thing I was talking about international ness.

1391
01:25:22,003 --> 01:25:33,660
Scott: they're going to have Microsoft Live whatnot and Xboxes sold in South Africa Chile India Brazil Poland Hungary the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

1392
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:42,900
Scott: Those countries are Notorious for complaining about getting games way after everyone else and having a lot of gamers in them.

1393
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,036
Rym: They're mostly ignored by the entire gaming industry.

1394
01:25:46,056 --> 01:25:48,567
Scott: Well, they're not ignored It's just they're delayed like Pete.

1395
01:25:48,587 --> 01:25:50,415
Scott: There's a lot of gamers in South Africa.

1396
01:25:50,475 --> 01:25:51,500
Scott: Like I've heard podcast.

1397
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,948
Scott: Well, they're always in gamers.

1398
01:25:52,968 --> 01:25:54,095
Rym: They're not the target.

1399
01:25:54,135 --> 01:25:54,900
Rym: They're a secondary.

1400
01:25:55,081 --> 01:25:59,260
Scott: Just there aren't enough people there to have the stuff shipped as early as everyone else.

1401
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,340
Scott: So they get stuff months and months and months even after Europe gets them.

1402
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:06,068
Rym: Yeah, and Europe gets stuff late and overpriced as it is.

1403
01:26:06,469 --> 01:26:12,853
Scott: So now Microsoft pretty much the only company who could do this is Because you know, you can get PC games to any.

1404
01:26:12,933 --> 01:26:14,120
Scott: that's the thing about PC games.

1405
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,447
Scott: They get everywhere all at once.

1406
01:26:15,487 --> 01:26:16,151
Scott: look at steam.

1407
01:26:16,352 --> 01:26:20,640
Scott: Everyone gets half-life 2 at the same time It gets it in every language in every country.

1408
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:25,119
Scott: That's why you always end up fighting some Dutch guy and CS or some Swedish guy and they kick your ass.

1409
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:38,799
Scott: Microsoft is gonna get Xbox out to all those countries at the same time and some people might have Vista and they'll just play on their PC and some people have a 360 and play on their 360 if they're poor and that's gonna be big.

1410
01:26:39,542 --> 01:26:41,067
Scott: You know your DS.

1411
01:26:41,107 --> 01:26:42,512
Scott: it says play worldwide.

1412
01:26:42,632 --> 01:26:44,900
Scott: that just means play against guys in Japan in Britain.

1413
01:26:45,362 --> 01:26:48,957
Scott: Yeah, the Xbox Live is gonna really be worldwide play.

1414
01:26:48,977 --> 01:26:51,167
Scott: It's you know PC gaming.

1415
01:26:51,188 --> 01:26:54,545
Scott: I don't think we'll see a big resurgence But what it'll be is they'll be.

1416
01:26:54,566 --> 01:27:07,480
Scott: the third platform will be Windows gaming as opposed to PC gaming and you'll be able to do your Windows gaming on a 360 or on a PC with Vista and I'll probably not do it on a PC with Vista because Vista is not gonna be good.

1417
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:15,651
Scott: Yeah for a lot of reasons that we talked about and a PC with Vista will be a lot more money than an Xbox Which is only going to go down in price from here on out now.

1418
01:27:15,711 --> 01:27:22,760
Rym: It's interesting that Nintendo, you know Obvious what their strategies are and it looks very interesting and Microsoft is doing this sort of thing.

1419
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,492
Rym: Sony's not really doing anything new.

1420
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:26,680
Rym: They're just doing more of the same.

1421
01:27:27,182 --> 01:27:32,060
Scott: Well, I think Sony's strategy is to you know, be what everyone else is all-in-one.

1422
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,441
Scott: They're like we're gonna be the Wii and the 360.

1423
01:27:34,441 --> 01:27:39,460
Scott: We can do everything that everyone else does and beat them all because the problem is is they're doing there.

1424
01:27:39,561 --> 01:27:44,964
Scott: It's basically a shitty Wii plus a shitty 360 Combined in.

1425
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:48,399
Rym: add a lot of horsepower power of shit power of obsolescence.

1426
01:27:48,988 --> 01:27:51,862
Scott: Hahaha You know.

1427
01:27:52,163 --> 01:27:54,611
Rym: and I got a rip on the ps3 one more time.

1428
01:27:54,952 --> 01:27:57,499
Rym: God day it if you've seen pictures of it.

1429
01:27:57,961 --> 01:28:01,754
Rym: Yeah, it looked that someone described it as a Victorian era waffle iron.

1430
01:28:02,116 --> 01:28:03,300
Rym: It's bigger than the Xbox.

1431
01:28:03,701 --> 01:28:05,227
Scott: Yeah, it's real big and real heavy.

1432
01:28:05,247 --> 01:28:06,874
Rym: the original Xbox not the new one.

1433
01:28:06,894 --> 01:28:07,396
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1434
01:28:07,857 --> 01:28:10,207
Scott: It's huge It's it's weighs.

1435
01:28:10,307 --> 01:28:13,260
Scott: I think what like twice as much as the original Xbox is a lot.

1436
01:28:13,883 --> 01:28:18,663
Rym: Yeah, it probably is comparable to the weight of my computer You know.

1437
01:28:18,744 --> 01:28:23,839
Scott: and this isn't just it's a lot of this is our opinion that you know, you might think that a giant ps3 is great.

1438
01:28:25,522 --> 01:28:35,020
Scott: But the general internet hum Note, there isn't a lot of people short of super PlayStation fanboys who are saying good things about Sony.

1439
01:28:35,221 --> 01:28:37,086
Scott: Everyone is saying bad things about Sony.

1440
01:28:37,366 --> 01:28:40,715
Scott: there hasn't been positive news about Sony in years.

1441
01:28:41,036 --> 01:28:42,480
Scott: You remember the root kits and everything.

1442
01:28:42,681 --> 01:28:50,240
Rym: It's just yeah, don't forget Sony infected their computers with their users their customers with viruses because they think they're criminals.

1443
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:53,046
Scott: Yeah So Sony is just.

1444
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:58,100
Scott: everyone loves to bash Sony and they're keep bashing them lately and they're going to continue to bash them the late.

1445
01:28:58,501 --> 01:29:14,707
Scott: the general feeling of the game media is that Sony is acting arrogantly and they're relying on their name recognition to just carry their dominance over into the next generation and not actually Realizing they need to be better than everyone else.

1446
01:29:14,807 --> 01:29:17,595
Scott: because and we'll see how it turns out now

1447
01:29:17,635 --> 01:29:28,789
Rym: compare that to the buzz about Microsoft Which after the Xbox 360 was announced and then it was released and then it sold out the buzz disappeared and no one really talked About it, but now that e3 has come around again.

1448
01:29:28,809 --> 01:29:32,040
Rym: The buzz is back and it's neutral to positive.

1449
01:29:32,461 --> 01:29:34,729
Rym: There's very little negative buzz about Microsoft.

1450
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:40,892
Scott: Sony is really the only company that people love to bash Microsoft Especially Linux guys like us and we're not.

1451
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:42,399
Scott: yeah, what does that tell you?

1452
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:46,046
Scott: And of course the line to see the.

1453
01:29:46,086 --> 01:29:49,377
Scott: we all can't deny this video of it.

1454
01:29:49,497 --> 01:29:50,300
Scott: How can you deny?

1455
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,746
Rym: Yeah, five minutes versus six hours.

1456
01:29:52,806 --> 01:29:59,125
Scott: There's something and the clapping at the Nintendo conference versus the Sony you can't deny there it is Black and white.

1457
01:29:59,607 --> 01:30:05,570
Scott: if you deny this then you might as well believe that you know Very heavily autistic kids can talk to you and type to you.

1458
01:30:05,711 --> 01:30:08,280
Rym: Yeah, we're not saying the ps3 is a bad platform.

1459
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:11,400
Rym: We're saying Sony is a bad company and they're doing stupid things.

1460
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:19,231
Scott: They're doing very stupid things and I predict they'll get their asses handed to them because the PSP is a cool piece And the press is saying very bad things about them.

1461
01:30:19,332 --> 01:30:25,355
Rym: Yeah, the mainstream press I mean investment types are saying the ps3 is so overpriced.

1462
01:30:25,395 --> 01:30:26,358
Rym: No one's gonna buy it.

1463
01:30:26,539 --> 01:30:29,368
Scott: Yep Alright, let's start talking about Xbox games.

1464
01:30:29,649 --> 01:30:30,372
Rym: Alright shadowrun.

1465
01:30:30,392 --> 01:30:31,395
Rym: I want to talk about shadowrun.

1466
01:30:31,636 --> 01:30:33,282
Scott: Okay, talk about shadowrun Alright.

1467
01:30:33,543 --> 01:30:40,064
Rym: there there were rumblings that I hadn't really heard until just now recently about Shadowrun game for the Xbox.

1468
01:30:40,084 --> 01:30:42,390
Scott: Well, that was at their press conference.

1469
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:49,185
Scott: Yeah before the press conference someone saw something on it In the being prepared show floor.

1470
01:30:49,206 --> 01:30:50,068
Scott: that said shadowrun.

1471
01:30:50,148 --> 01:30:52,835
Rym: Yep, and then it exploded on the internet as shadowrun.

1472
01:30:53,055 --> 01:30:53,797
Rym: That's all I know.

1473
01:30:53,817 --> 01:31:01,482
Rym: and Then we found out and now a lot of fans of shadowrun have been complaining saying that they ruined shadowrun Mm-hmm.

1474
01:31:02,184 --> 01:31:03,931
Rym: I like shed a little bit of my own light on that.

1475
01:31:04,574 --> 01:31:11,540
Rym: for anyone who has never played shadowrun It is a role-playing game system like Dungeons & Dragons Forgotten Realms say or Dragon lance.

1476
01:31:11,621 --> 01:31:13,976
Rym: It is a system coupled with a universe.

1477
01:31:14,278 --> 01:31:22,614
Rym: Mm-hmm The universe has a history that has come out from the base books Plus the source books plus the novels and all that stuff like every gaming world has yep.

1478
01:31:23,918 --> 01:31:29,288
Rym: It is incredibly Convoluted difficult to follow full of a million things.

1479
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:44,254
Rym: It is cyberpunk futurism magic shamanism dragons Net hacking flying through cyberspace astral projections gods and shaman totems Politics everything everything everything everything all rolled into one, but it's mostly dark.

1480
01:31:44,575 --> 01:31:44,775
Rym: Yes.

1481
01:31:44,836 --> 01:31:46,120
Rym: It's very dark and dystopian.

1482
01:31:46,403 --> 01:31:50,540
Scott: Yeah, so it's while it's everything It's not light and happy anyway.

1483
01:31:50,661 --> 01:31:58,215
Rym: Really now people are complaining that the game that's going to be coming out for the Xbox Which they didn't actually tell us that much about it other than that.

1484
01:31:58,436 --> 01:31:59,320
Rym: It's going to exist.

1485
01:32:00,262 --> 01:32:06,219
Rym: They're changing the plotline the history of the shadowrun world a bit to make the game work.

1486
01:32:08,301 --> 01:32:15,019
Rym: The details are unimportant because if you know if you care about shadowrun you already know and if you don't care you already don't care.

1487
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:23,460
Rym: But they're pushing some history events out and they're kind of changing the timeline and there's a giant uproar among the hardcore fans of shadowrun.

1488
01:32:24,502 --> 01:32:26,660
Scott: Alright, well that's slightly different from what I was reading.

1489
01:32:27,181 --> 01:32:35,679
Scott: What I was reading that people were upset that the game was not going to be in any way similar to the SNES game is Going to be a squad based combat game.

1490
01:32:36,262 --> 01:32:37,366
Rym: Why would anyone complain about that?

1491
01:32:37,386 --> 01:32:40,477
Rym: the SNES game was cool, but it was pretty terrible.

1492
01:32:40,618 --> 01:32:48,560
Scott: all things considered People apparently wanted an RPG game and not a squad based combat game because apparently there is squad based combat games of the wazoo.

1493
01:32:49,165 --> 01:32:50,357
Rym: Yeah, that's true, too.

1494
01:32:51,421 --> 01:32:58,000
Scott: People are saying at least the quotes that I saw in two places that this wasn't a slight changing of the shadowrun history.

1495
01:32:58,101 --> 01:33:03,272
Scott: This was it's a fairly big change But it still are saying that they completely threw out everything shadowrun.

1496
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:06,442
Scott: and the only thing this has in common with shadowrun is The name.

1497
01:33:06,683 --> 01:33:12,021
Scott: and why did they buy the license just for the name to sell the game if they're not gonna actually use any other Stuff?

1498
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:13,828
Rym: well the thing I don't think they threw everything out.

1499
01:33:13,908 --> 01:33:15,313
Rym: It's that the type of game.

1500
01:33:15,354 --> 01:33:17,060
Rym: It is doesn't really behoove.

1501
01:33:18,383 --> 01:33:21,219
Rym: You don't care about a lot of the history of the game if you're making a game.

1502
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,065
Rym: That's more simply based on the combat.

1503
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:24,530
Rym: You don't care about?

1504
01:33:24,831 --> 01:33:27,580
Scott: yeah, then why that people are saying why have the shadowrun?

1505
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:28,680
Scott: I'm just saying what people are saying.

1506
01:33:28,702 --> 01:33:29,843
Scott: Oh, yeah I don't really care.

1507
01:33:29,964 --> 01:33:33,296
Scott: one why have the shadowrun license for a game that doesn't need it?

1508
01:33:33,337 --> 01:33:35,566
Scott: if you're not gonna use it You're just putting a name on that.

1509
01:33:35,606 --> 01:33:36,228
Scott: try and sell it.

1510
01:33:36,309 --> 01:33:37,152
Rym: I submit two things.

1511
01:33:37,513 --> 01:33:39,783
Rym: one the name will sell To.

1512
01:33:39,924 --> 01:33:43,479
Rym: the world that comes from has a lot of fodder from which to make a game.

1513
01:33:44,242 --> 01:33:46,769
Scott: Yeah the thing that people are saying they're not using the fodder yet.

1514
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:48,334
Rym: three by the license.

1515
01:33:48,474 --> 01:33:50,522
Rym: once then you know by use it Again.

1516
01:33:50,563 --> 01:33:52,300
Rym: make more games about shadowrun.

1517
01:33:52,741 --> 01:33:58,020
Rym: Maybe this game is very generic to test the waters of what do people think of shadowrun type games?

1518
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:08,058
Scott: But the thing is is that if you put it the label shadowrun on a game that Says you're trying to sell your you know a game is gonna sell to whatever people it's gonna sell to.

1519
01:34:08,118 --> 01:34:12,119
Scott: normally Putting the shadowrun label on a game means you're going to.

1520
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:19,520
Scott: You're paying money to get that label in order to sell it to all the people who would buy anything with the name shadow.

1521
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:22,834
Scott: See now I don't think if you don't make a game that pleases those people.

1522
01:34:22,874 --> 01:34:24,140
Scott: you're only going to piss them off.

1523
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,788
Rym: But the thing is there aren't that many shadowrun people.

1524
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:30,540
Rym: I love shadowrun, but I stopped only I didn't play it since high school.

1525
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,720
Scott: That's not what the internet seems to be happening all these shadowrun things.

1526
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:36,965
Scott: There are people coming out of the work everywhere commenting on this Oh, they are.

1527
01:34:37,025 --> 01:34:40,880
Scott: but I mean if people didn't play shadowrun Oh, it would have been people play it.

1528
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,360
Scott: You know if people didn't know what shadowrun was people would say what the fuck is out of run.

1529
01:34:44,503 --> 01:34:45,260
Scott: Why do I hear that?

1530
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:45,882
Scott: There's a shadow run.

1531
01:34:45,902 --> 01:34:50,663
Rym: keep in mind that most of the people who came out really angrily are the heart are the dedicated fans of Shadowrun.

1532
01:34:51,246 --> 01:34:53,900
Rym: people who aren't fans of shadowrun don't know much about it and don't care.

1533
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:54,524
Scott: It seems that they're.

1534
01:34:54,705 --> 01:34:56,293
Scott: yeah, but why put the label on?

1535
01:34:56,334 --> 01:35:00,954
Scott: if you put the label on it You're not going to get people who aren't fans of shadowrun to buy it.

1536
01:35:01,255 --> 01:35:06,060
Scott: putting the label on it means We are going to pay money to sell this game to hardcore fans of shadowrun.

1537
01:35:06,442 --> 01:35:09,300
Scott: If you make it in such a way the hardcore fans of shadowrun won't like it.

1538
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:14,260
Scott: They're not gonna buy it and you just spent money on a label you couldn't you could have avoided spending money on one.

1539
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:15,866
Rym: They probably got the license pretty cheap.

1540
01:35:16,207 --> 01:35:19,298
Scott: Well, I think Microsoft actually owns the FASA corporation.

1541
01:35:19,358 --> 01:35:23,108
Rym: Yeah Shadowrun doesn't make much money.

1542
01:35:23,128 --> 01:35:26,180
Rym: our pen and paper games in general are not doing well.

1543
01:35:26,561 --> 01:35:36,958
Rym: Dungeons & Dragons is far and away still the champion and shadowrun Really died for a long time after for a while after second ed came out.

1544
01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:44,039
Scott: Yes It was vitalized for game died but apparently knowledge of the universe and interest in it is not dead.

1545
01:35:44,059 --> 01:35:45,639
Rym: because Oh, it's not bad.

1546
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:53,128
Scott: There are articles everywhere that said they're gonna make a shadowrun game and if people didn't know what shadowrun was or care about it They would have said what the hell shadowrun.

1547
01:35:53,188 --> 01:35:53,810
Scott: Oh, yeah, I didn't.

1548
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:55,316
Scott: there's thousands of people going.

1549
01:35:55,336 --> 01:35:56,300
Scott: Oh my god shadowrun.

1550
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,713
Rym: Whoo, what I'm saying is that a lot of people are.

1551
01:35:58,773 --> 01:36:00,039
Rym: I think a lot of these people are like me.

1552
01:36:00,682 --> 01:36:05,620
Rym: I played shadowrun a long time ago and I loved it and then it kind of died and I couldn't play it.

1553
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:12,067
Rym: But I still know about it and I like it and I've always wanted something to come back with it And now something's coming back with it.

1554
01:36:12,348 --> 01:36:15,459
Rym: The name rekindles these things even though people don't play it so much now.

1555
01:36:16,961 --> 01:36:18,831
Scott: Yeah, but the people who know the name.

1556
01:36:19,353 --> 01:36:21,844
Scott: if they care about that name They know something about it.

1557
01:36:22,105 --> 01:36:27,064
Scott: and being nerdy as only someone who knows about shadowrun is going to be nerdy They don't like it.

1558
01:36:27,104 --> 01:36:33,713
Scott: when you mess with what it was if I release a game and I put the Star Wars name on it And it doesn't have lightsabers and x-wings and TIE fighters.

1559
01:36:33,894 --> 01:36:35,080
Rym: You mean like Star Wars galaxies.

1560
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:38,169
Scott: People aren't gonna like that game Star Wars galaxies.

1561
01:36:38,189 --> 01:36:40,477
Rym: They're gonna yell at me, which was just people dancing in the desert.

1562
01:36:40,838 --> 01:36:41,280
Scott: exactly.

1563
01:36:41,644 --> 01:36:47,276
Rym: See, I guess I'm a shadowrun fan But I don't really care much for the timeline because it's mostly kind of silly and convoluted.

1564
01:36:47,296 --> 01:36:55,560
Scott: not saying it's not silly I'm just saying this is akin to someone buying the Star Wars label putting it on a game and then Taking out all the Star Wars stuff.

1565
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:57,527
Scott: it's like no one's gonna anyone.

1566
01:36:57,607 --> 01:37:08,296
Scott: you're putting the Star Wars label means you're gonna try to sell it to Star Wars fans and If you don't have Star Wars stuff They're purposefully not going to buy it because of the type of people fans are I just.

1567
01:37:08,336 --> 01:37:15,999
Rym: I think the game's gonna do fine And I'll bet this is only gonna be the first of a string of shadowrun games And I'll bet at least one of them will be an RPG at some point.

1568
01:37:16,642 --> 01:37:26,180
Scott: Well judging by the you know internet talk about it It's a it's a mixed bag, we'll see until people actually get their hands on the game.

1569
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:28,285
Rym: Yeah, I just have this feeling.

1570
01:37:28,306 --> 01:37:31,614
Rym: this is a complete gut hunch that the game will do.

1571
01:37:31,655 --> 01:37:31,835
Rym: Well.

1572
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:34,384
Rym: This is a hunch like mr What's it from?

1573
01:37:34,444 --> 01:37:36,093
Rym: Scotland Yard is hiding in the subway?

1574
01:37:36,435 --> 01:37:36,737
Scott: Yeah?

1575
01:37:36,898 --> 01:37:41,614
Scott: We'll see Halo 3 man.

1576
01:37:42,198 --> 01:37:46,570
Scott: yeah If you do the halo rant we always do.

1577
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:48,096
Scott: or should we just sum it up really quickly?

1578
01:37:48,116 --> 01:37:53,477
Rym: uh Real quick Halo is not innovative or new or good.

1579
01:37:54,462 --> 01:37:55,405
Rym: It is doing things.

1580
01:37:55,506 --> 01:37:55,827
Rym: now.

1581
01:37:56,148 --> 01:37:59,039
Rym: that PCs did with FPS is almost a decade ago.

1582
01:37:59,561 --> 01:38:06,180
Scott: Basically what happened in the history of FPS is is people grew up playing FPS and they played quake and everything.

1583
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,599
Scott: They were real FPS players.

1584
01:38:08,041 --> 01:38:18,499
Scott: Then there was Goldeneye, which is the console FPS which is not much compared to the PC FPS But because it was on a console and as for player it didn't need to have everything the PC FPS has had.

1585
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:20,387
Rym: yep I mean compared to a PC game.

1586
01:38:20,407 --> 01:38:22,618
Rym: It was piss-poor, but for a console FPS.

1587
01:38:22,658 --> 01:38:25,812
Scott: It was great Yeah, and it's still one of the greatest console FPS is.

1588
01:38:26,414 --> 01:38:34,425
Scott: so what happened was is You eventually got to counter-strike and the whole thing stagnated and kind of you know Stayed still for a long time.

1589
01:38:34,465 --> 01:38:36,010
Rym: Yeah, it didn't die by far.

1590
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:38,820
Rym: counter-strike is still played by a lot of freaking people.

1591
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:49,356
Scott: It's one of the biggest games yep, but when halo came out It was like the resurgence of FPSing because there was finally an FPS that was accessible to a lot of people.

1592
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:54,351
Scott: the thing is People who played real FPS is like counter-strike and shit was like.

1593
01:38:54,993 --> 01:39:03,560
Scott: most of them were like halo is crap, and I found this out Because most of the people I knew who played halo were either younger or people who weren't big into real FPS.

1594
01:39:04,384 --> 01:39:11,860
Scott: And my brother who is the halo age yet He played counter-strike because he was my brother was like yeah, halo sucks.

1595
01:39:12,941 --> 01:39:18,380
Rym: Yeah, I mean I remember playing halo, and it was just really really generic and kind of dumb.

1596
01:39:18,901 --> 01:39:21,230
Scott: I mean tribes 2 is better than halo by a hajillion.

1597
01:39:21,551 --> 01:39:24,160
Rym: tribes 2 is probably in my opinion the best FPS.

1598
01:39:24,381 --> 01:39:26,555
Scott: I played the halo 1 PC demo.

1599
01:39:26,675 --> 01:39:35,712
Scott: I remember and Even with the mouse and keyboard it was just this really easy walk around shoot guys game And it was kind of blah, and I know the multiplayer.

1600
01:39:35,752 --> 01:39:37,700
Scott: you can have a lot of fun with vehicles and stuff.

1601
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:39,686
Scott: But unreal tournament, I like.

1602
01:39:39,866 --> 01:39:49,680
Scott: I played unreal tournament 2007 demo and that was a lot more fun than halo multiplayer But still to halos credit it brought a lot of new people into the FPS genre.

1603
01:39:50,061 --> 01:39:57,780
Scott: It's basically the easy FPS for wussies and real FPS players play something else and all the halo noobs play halo.

1604
01:39:58,281 --> 01:40:03,980
Rym: Well the thing is people haven't really moved on in the FPS world and PCs because the best games are still counter-strike.

1605
01:40:04,842 --> 01:40:05,945
Scott: Yeah, they're standing still.

1606
01:40:06,627 --> 01:40:11,080
Scott: so it's like there's two tiers of FPS playing and halo is the lower tier.

1607
01:40:11,181 --> 01:40:12,799
Scott: It's like the entry-level FPS.

1608
01:40:13,981 --> 01:40:20,420
Rym: Now I wonder I mean it's hard to make a PC like FPS on a console mostly because you don't have a keyboard and mouse.

1609
01:40:21,263 --> 01:40:24,880
Rym: You don't have the ability to change the game as easily over time with updates.

1610
01:40:25,121 --> 01:40:36,680
Scott: You can't have really complex controls because there are only so many buttons, so you can't give people Jetpacks and a billion weapons and a bunch of sidearm grenades and all kinds of crazy stuff.

1611
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:39,011
Rym: Yeah, if anyone out there thinks halo is complex.

1612
01:40:39,493 --> 01:40:51,880
Rym: I dare you I double dog dare you to play weapons factory or Mega-tf without a whole bunch of crazy scripts to run your freaking character for you while you're running around.

1613
01:40:52,201 --> 01:40:52,845
Rym: Yeah, you had.

1614
01:40:52,885 --> 01:40:59,792
Rym: you would have like 20 keys bound to 20 esoteric weird Tribes - is complex enough tribes - had its own scripting language.

1615
01:41:00,193 --> 01:41:00,413
Scott: Well.

1616
01:41:00,815 --> 01:41:09,140
Scott: It was just the engine has a scripting language That's pretty much C++ because the way it's written Yeah, which was great compared to frickin half or not the half-life wasn't so bad.

1617
01:41:09,441 --> 01:41:18,907
Rym: But quake - where you had to write in this stupid obtuse barely work scripting language that was laggy and buggy and crap Mm-hmm, but you needed to do it to play these games.

1618
01:41:18,927 --> 01:41:21,514
Rym: There was no complex all right now.

1619
01:41:21,554 --> 01:41:22,777
Scott: There was something mentioned.

1620
01:41:22,797 --> 01:41:25,985
Scott: I think Great Grand Theft Auto.

1621
01:41:26,005 --> 01:41:32,144
Scott: for now what happened was I'm sure everyone has seen on the internet the Xbox guy.

1622
01:41:32,365 --> 01:41:33,611
Scott: what he did is he was like.

1623
01:41:33,912 --> 01:41:35,700
Scott: you know he said something a lot.

1624
01:41:35,861 --> 01:41:44,283
Scott: He was trying to make a joke and he said like girly man You have rubber duckies referring to Sony using a rubber duck and all their demos And he's like real.

1625
01:41:44,324 --> 01:41:51,840
Scott: men get tattoos, and he shows he had a tattoo for Halo 2 and on his other arm He had a tattoo for Grand Theft Auto 4.

1626
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,599
Scott: I think someone else is doing a job of finding out what the tattoos are real or not.

1627
01:41:56,263 --> 01:41:58,897
Rym: I saw on a report someone said that they are real.

1628
01:41:59,139 --> 01:42:00,727
Rym: Wow But the report was.

1629
01:42:00,768 --> 01:42:02,718
Rym: someone asked him if they were real and he said yes.

1630
01:42:03,524 --> 01:42:05,679
Rym: Which may or may not be true tattoo?

1631
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,949
Scott: Professionals say the Grand Theft Auto one was a lot.

1632
01:42:08,989 --> 01:42:12,480
Scott: the white color used in it was a lot brighter than any tattoo can be.

1633
01:42:12,961 --> 01:42:18,420
Scott: So they speculated as to whether it was painted over to be brighter, or if it just wasn't real at all.

1634
01:42:19,224 --> 01:42:20,389
Scott: Well it remains to be seen.

1635
01:42:20,469 --> 01:42:22,680
Rym: we'll find out a year from now if you still got it now.

1636
01:42:23,201 --> 01:42:27,135
Scott: Grand Theft Auto 4 they said sometime around the end in 2007. so it's a ways off.

1637
01:42:29,002 --> 01:42:41,566
Scott: But what we know about it is we don't think it's gonna be exclusive to the Xbox 360. however It's going to come out for the Xbox 360 Before it comes out for anything else.

1638
01:42:41,707 --> 01:42:52,472
Scott: it might come out for the PlayStation 3 and the PC on the same day as it comes Out for the 360, but it's guaranteed that when it comes out the day it comes out It'll be available on the 360 for sure.

1639
01:42:52,492 --> 01:42:57,744
Rym: yeah This seems to be a new trend in exclusivity because you can't really Exclusive.

1640
01:42:57,764 --> 01:43:00,880
Rym: games aren't really good for the people who make the games.

1641
01:43:01,101 --> 01:43:08,370
Scott: They're good for the people who have the consoles so they have to usually pay you know the Developer to make the game exclusive to you.

1642
01:43:08,451 --> 01:43:21,699
Scott: now what Microsoft is doing is They sort of made a compromise it seems with Rockstar because Rockstar doesn't want their game to be exclusive to the Xbox 360. unless the PlayStation 3 bombs then they don't care yeah, because that means less sales for them.

1643
01:43:22,341 --> 01:43:34,605
Scott: So what it seems they've done is they made a deal with Rockstar where if you play on the 360 you're going to get some exclusive levels and things extra Through Xbox Live.

1644
01:43:34,646 --> 01:43:34,987
Scott: of course.

1645
01:43:35,268 --> 01:43:40,908
Rym: now as much as I don't always like that sort of thing It's definitely better than locking into one console.

1646
01:43:41,148 --> 01:43:45,441
Scott: Yes better for gamers is better for gamers who want to play Grand Theft Auto 4.

1647
01:43:45,441 --> 01:43:46,211
Scott: I don't want to play it.

1648
01:43:46,515 --> 01:43:50,051
Scott: however What it's gonna Do is it's gonna do a Soul Calibur 2 effect.

1649
01:43:50,453 --> 01:43:54,859
Scott: Soul Calibur 2 was in every system But the GameCube was the system to play it on because it had link.

1650
01:43:55,544 --> 01:44:01,696
Scott: Grand Theft Auto 4 will be on all the you know the systems But the Xbox will be the system to play it on because it has these downloads.

1651
01:44:01,757 --> 01:44:07,980
Rym: yep now I wouldn't be surprised long term if they made some sort of special Grand Theft for the Wii with the Wii controller.

1652
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:08,765
Rym: They could do something.

1653
01:44:08,986 --> 01:44:09,691
Scott: they could drive eyes.

1654
01:44:09,711 --> 01:44:10,033
Scott: I don't know.

1655
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:16,220
Scott: Rockstar seems to be the kind of company that won't do it unless a lot of people buy Wiis.

1656
01:44:16,641 --> 01:44:22,360
Scott: Yeah, which I think a lot of people will yeah, but the other thing is the people who buy Wiis aren't gonna.

1657
01:44:22,661 --> 01:44:26,191
Scott: You know Nintendo's like yeah, you hardcore people aren't gonna buy Wiis.

1658
01:44:26,291 --> 01:44:29,380
Scott: grandmas and kids and everyone else and girls are gonna buy Wiis.

1659
01:44:30,124 --> 01:44:32,820
Rym: So it's more me hoping than me expecting.

1660
01:44:33,021 --> 01:44:36,880
Scott: Yep, so those people aren't the types to buy Grand Theft Auto, but Rockstar smart.

1661
01:44:36,981 --> 01:44:39,040
Rym: I mean they make games that make them a lot of money.

1662
01:44:39,181 --> 01:44:43,167
Rym: So if there's a market for that sort of thing you can bet they'll do it alright.

1663
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:49,013
Scott: Microsoft really seems to be expanding the Xbox Live arcade deal.

1664
01:44:49,134 --> 01:44:51,240
Scott: There was something about Lou mines live.

1665
01:44:51,882 --> 01:45:00,449
Scott: I guess you'd play Lou mines on your Xbox and your cell phone and whatever and it'd be some sort of like Something with the webcam.

1666
01:45:00,609 --> 01:45:04,603
Scott: I don't know what I talked about it that much because no one cares about DDR universe.

1667
01:45:04,843 --> 01:45:07,351
Scott: so apparently Xbox is the system for DDR.

1668
01:45:07,873 --> 01:45:10,240
Rym: Yeah, I can see us downloading new songs.

1669
01:45:10,841 --> 01:45:12,148
Scott: Hopefully they won't charge for them.

1670
01:45:12,168 --> 01:45:12,832
Scott: That's the thing.

1671
01:45:12,872 --> 01:45:13,254
Scott: They will.

1672
01:45:13,335 --> 01:45:13,938
Rym: I guarantee it.

1673
01:45:15,182 --> 01:45:17,340
Rym: I'd freaking guarantee they're gonna charge money for the songs.

1674
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:19,308
Rym: They'll have to because the songs are copyrighted.

1675
01:45:19,348 --> 01:45:22,180
Scott: can see that sounds more like Sony's bag charging for the songs.

1676
01:45:22,363 --> 01:45:27,939
Rym: Yeah, the our game But there I don't see any way around it because the people who own the music are probably going to be pricks about it.

1677
01:45:28,242 --> 01:45:31,246
Scott: Well, we'll see Viva pinata.

1678
01:45:31,689 --> 01:45:31,950
Scott: now.

1679
01:45:32,513 --> 01:45:39,228
Scott: when they showed this game People kind of went grumbly grumbly and then the ex the guy on stage was like, come on.

1680
01:45:39,268 --> 01:45:51,166
Scott: It's an e-rated game and The crowd's reaction was like yeah, whatever It's from what people say it looks like an Animal Crossing type of game, which is like, alright You're trying to copy Animal Crossing whatever.

1681
01:45:51,828 --> 01:46:00,032
Scott: but all the guy the press people seem to be saying I We weren't not cheering because it was an e-rated game.

1682
01:46:00,073 --> 01:46:02,160
Scott: We weren't cheering because it didn't look that interesting.

1683
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:07,160
Scott: It's look like ghetto, you know, it's hard to tell Animal Crossing the little pin.

1684
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:13,680
Rym: Yeah It's hard to tell what they're trying to do with this game other than maybe Steal some of the people who want Animal Crossing over to the Xbox.

1685
01:46:14,462 --> 01:46:31,580
Scott: yeah, maybe what's gonna happen is people buy an Xbox and instead of you know going out and Spending a bunch of money on a Wii for their kids They'll just buy Viva pinata for their already Existing 360 and then spend the rest of the money they would have spent on a Wii on more 360 stuff for themselves.

1686
01:46:32,161 --> 01:46:34,899
Rym: Of course for the price of a ps3 you can just buy an Xbox and a Wii.

1687
01:46:35,363 --> 01:46:37,099
Scott: But well, no, we don't know how much the Wii cost yet.

1688
01:46:37,422 --> 01:46:40,239
Rym: I pretty much guarantee you'll be able to buy them both for the price of a ps3.

1689
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:43,188
Scott: Yep, people seem to be guaranteeing that it'll probably be true.

1690
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:49,640
Rym: In fact Microsoft themselves have come out and basically said yeah Sony socks, you should buy a Wii.

1691
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:57,719
Scott: Remember how before I was saying Sony it does the same thing as a Wii only crappier and does the same thing as a 360 only crappier.

1692
01:46:58,261 --> 01:47:04,860
Scott: That would work out if the ps3 cost less than both of the systems combined because then it's like I can get both for less.

1693
01:47:05,382 --> 01:47:16,319
Scott: but this is why get something that does two things and Each thing it does is shittier when I can get both of those things to the max separately for the same price or even less

1694
01:47:18,202 --> 01:47:21,600
Rym: And this is Microsoft talking because they don't care if Nintendo is successful or not.

1695
01:47:21,941 --> 01:47:31,820
Scott: it's like cell phone cameras work because it's cheaper than the price of a cell phone and a camera and Combining them is good because you have your cell phone everywhere with you.

1696
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:35,499
Scott: So now you have a camera everywhere with you and the camera is all of a sudden becomes more useful.

1697
01:47:36,601 --> 01:47:40,593
Scott: Having a Wii combined with an Xbox Live is sort of useful.

1698
01:47:40,654 --> 01:47:49,160
Scott: the same way having a camera on your phone is useful but If for the same price as a camera phone you can get a camera and a phone then the camera phone doesn't work.

1699
01:47:49,822 --> 01:47:55,540
Rym: Yep, of course Nintendo wins all around because people could own a ps3 and a Wii or an Xbox and a Wii.

1700
01:47:56,203 --> 01:47:58,920
Rym: Not many people are going to own Xbox and a ps3.

1701
01:47:59,901 --> 01:48:02,549
Rym: Not many now because the games are gonna mostly overlap.

1702
01:48:02,589 --> 01:48:06,903
Rym: aside from the exclusives every third-party game is gonna come out on both systems Mm-hmm.

1703
01:48:07,365 --> 01:48:13,860
Rym: In fact that could actually be a really bad point for Sony because yeah The PlayStation 3 has better graphics capabilities, right?

1704
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:23,604
Rym: Yeah, but if a third party makes a game for the Xbox and the ps3 They're gonna make damn well sure it runs on the Xbox and I don't know how much extra effort they're gonna put into making it Look better.

1705
01:48:23,644 --> 01:48:31,280
Scott: They usually they make it look better If you look at history of all the millions of games that are released on the ps2 and the Xbox.

1706
01:48:31,701 --> 01:48:37,540
Scott: People always well almost always put in the extra effort to make it look better on the more powerful system.

1707
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:38,947
Scott: However, ever they don't.

1708
01:48:39,007 --> 01:48:41,340
Rym: then the X the extra effort was easier.

1709
01:48:41,801 --> 01:48:45,773
Rym: It's of everyone's keep saying it's hellishly hard to do anything with the ps3.

1710
01:48:46,013 --> 01:48:48,059
Scott: development wise I still think you know.

1711
01:48:48,922 --> 01:48:55,160
Scott: What happens is if you don't make your game look you've released a game for a bunch of systems and it doesn't look better.

1712
01:48:55,300 --> 01:49:00,200
Scott: On the more powerful system all the press yells at you and gives you a worse review.

1713
01:49:00,741 --> 01:49:04,694
Scott: Game developers will put in as much extra effort as they feel necessary.

1714
01:49:04,895 --> 01:49:09,071
Rym: Well, they have always done Yeah, but we'll see how much extra effort they will do it.

1715
01:49:09,091 --> 01:49:10,036
Rym: three scales.

1716
01:49:10,116 --> 01:49:13,307
Rym: There are a lot of Levels of effort you can put in.

1717
01:49:13,588 --> 01:49:16,480
Scott: they will do it until it becomes, you know cost prohibitive.

1718
01:49:19,624 --> 01:49:21,860
Scott: Rest of the Xbox 360 games were kind of normal.

1719
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:28,555
Scott: You know the sports games a lot of peace a lot of games that would have been PC games But are now gonna be PC slash 360 games.

1720
01:49:29,305 --> 01:49:31,386
Scott: Yeah What the 360 is all about.

1721
01:49:32,209 --> 01:49:35,520
Rym: a lot of people also pointed out that the buzz at e3 is that people were saying?

1722
01:49:35,962 --> 01:49:39,279
Rym: Yeah, the ps3 is more powerful, but the Xbox games looked better?

1723
01:49:39,962 --> 01:49:41,368
Rym: Yeah, well, it's interesting.

1724
01:49:41,388 --> 01:49:45,565
Scott: The thing is is that you didn't see a lot of Ps3 game.

1725
01:49:45,585 --> 01:49:47,939
Rym: we saw a lot of FMV saw a lot of FMV.

1726
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:51,008
Scott: You saw a lot of FMVs and bullshots for the 360 also.

1727
01:49:51,028 --> 01:50:02,395
Scott: Yep, but there was gameplay footage that was seen and The opinion of most people is that right now a lot of the ps3 footage doesn't look that much better than 360 at games themselves.

1728
01:50:04,922 --> 01:50:06,006
Rym: I really think we're just there's.

1729
01:50:06,287 --> 01:50:07,491
Rym: they're diminishing returns.

1730
01:50:07,551 --> 01:50:14,420
Scott: and if you're someone like us who doesn't care about graphics What matters is all the other stuff where Microsoft has a distinct advantage.

1731
01:50:15,241 --> 01:50:17,669
Rym: Yeah, of course, we don't even have HDTV.

1732
01:50:17,689 --> 01:50:19,013
Rym: So for us we don't care at all.

1733
01:50:19,334 --> 01:50:20,980
Scott: No, I could care less of it at HD.

1734
01:50:21,301 --> 01:50:25,373
Scott: So, you know the fact that the ps3 is 1080 whatever and the 360 is 720 doesn't mean anything to me.

1735
01:50:27,801 --> 01:50:36,457
Scott: I'm gonna be doing 480i All right, all the rest of the games are sequels franchises licenses usual type of games you see.

1736
01:50:36,477 --> 01:50:43,940
Rym: yeah The only last thing we really would have talked about but I don't have much to say about it Even though some people have asked is will write spore?

1737
01:50:44,562 --> 01:50:46,428
Scott: Yeah, this is what I know about.

1738
01:50:46,468 --> 01:50:50,160
Scott: will write spore because I don't pay attention to PC games so much because I'm Linux guy.

1739
01:50:51,001 --> 01:50:52,106
Scott: It's gonna be PC game.

1740
01:50:52,126 --> 01:50:54,878
Scott: If you don't know will write is the sims sim city?

1741
01:50:54,938 --> 01:50:56,405
Scott: cool guy He makes good games.

1742
01:50:56,585 --> 01:50:59,520
Rym: you make a little creature and then you like breed it and evolve it.

1743
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:15,260
Scott: yeah, it's like you start out with like a bacteria or protozoa and you can make decisions and modify and over time you know it evolves and grows and Eventually you get a society and you can see the effects carry through all the way to the end of the game.

1744
01:51:15,361 --> 01:51:27,760
Scott: so if you give your protozoa like Three little feelers now your people when they when they evolve into an advanced life form now that advanced Life form was three arms Yeah, and yeah

1745
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:30,387
Rym: Madam and you have to deal with don't have

1746
01:51:30,407 --> 01:51:36,246
Scott: to develop your whole society now around the fact that your guys have three arms And etcetera etcetera etcetera

1747
01:51:36,447 --> 01:51:39,739
Rym: that we don't really yet even know too much about the game.

1748
01:51:40,381 --> 01:51:41,365
Rym: I mean, there's a lot.

1749
01:51:41,385 --> 01:51:44,417
Scott: I could have read some more articles about it, but I did.

1750
01:51:44,477 --> 01:51:45,220
Scott: I do the show.

1751
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:52,250
Rym: I read the article where they had some people who were at his little presentation thing and I didn't really gain much from it.

1752
01:51:52,451 --> 01:51:56,680
Scott: They didn't really the games not ready yet It sounds like it might be a fun game.

1753
01:51:56,941 --> 01:52:00,940
Rym: They people basically see me and they'd say it's a sandbox game.

1754
01:52:01,381 --> 01:52:05,054
Rym: That is also kind of a like Sim Earth Sim galaxy.

1755
01:52:05,616 --> 01:52:06,820
Scott: Yeah, hopefully not a Sim Ant.

1756
01:52:07,605 --> 01:52:14,360
Rym: Sim Ant was awesome and by awesome I mean it was awesome for five minutes, and then you'd already done everything you could ever do in the game.

1757
01:52:15,622 --> 01:52:23,520
Scott: Here's hoping that Spore is fun, and here's hoping that it's not just a Windows game that I'll never play.

1758
01:52:24,623 --> 01:52:31,035
Rym: I think we'll have to wait until there's more info about it Or maybe until we get it and play it before we can say much.

1759
01:52:31,658 --> 01:52:37,660
Scott: Yeah Maybe I'll try to read some more stuff about it, and we'll do a quick preview on a future Tuesday.

1760
01:52:39,301 --> 01:52:41,492
Rym: But for that Scott's a hacking up a storm here.

1761
01:52:41,532 --> 01:52:44,722
Rym: I think he's getting sick or something but oh That's good.

1762
01:52:44,762 --> 01:52:45,807
Scott: Everyone's gonna love to hear that.

1763
01:52:45,867 --> 01:52:48,840
Scott: cuz I haven't been sick in how long a little while.

1764
01:52:49,422 --> 01:52:51,815
Scott: Yeah, cuz I don't get sick very often.

1765
01:52:51,895 --> 01:52:52,779
Scott: It's a rare event.

1766
01:52:53,523 --> 01:52:57,518
Scott: No, no podcasting will be lost over this unless I am hospital ill.

1767
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:58,604
Rym: yeah But he's over there.

1768
01:52:58,644 --> 01:53:00,594
Rym: hacking and coughing is making it kind of annoying.

1769
01:53:00,634 --> 01:53:01,720
Rym: so I think we'll just stop here.

1770
01:53:02,001 --> 01:53:10,560
Scott: I think we covered all the e3 stuff anyway you remember you can Figure out all the other stuff that happened at e3 by going to all the gaming websites.

1771
01:53:11,103 --> 01:53:12,935
Scott: IGN and whatnot has all the info.

1772
01:53:12,975 --> 01:53:16,168
Scott: game spot E3 buzz comm is really good.

1773
01:53:16,188 --> 01:53:18,537
Scott: I've been using that a lot for the past week or so.

1774
01:53:18,557 --> 01:53:19,240
Scott: yep though.

1775
01:53:19,321 --> 01:53:25,615
Rym: So if if you haven't been following it It's kind of intimidating to go there from scratch because now you don't know anything.

1776
01:53:25,635 --> 01:53:27,908
Rym: if I go there now It's like oh, there's a new thing.

1777
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:28,876
Rym: Oh, there's a new thing.

1778
01:53:29,178 --> 01:53:35,101
Scott: yeah But if you haven't been going there all along you just see the newest thing and it's hard to realize what all the old things Are.

1779
01:53:35,262 --> 01:53:37,472
Scott: yeah, there are a lot of summaries.

1780
01:53:37,532 --> 01:53:41,004
Scott: if you go to Kotaku and gadget Kotaku's joy stick.

1781
01:53:41,024 --> 01:53:44,378
Rym: in my opinion Kotaku and joystick have a lot of just like oh here was a cool thing.

1782
01:53:44,418 --> 01:53:44,880
Rym: Here's a video.

1783
01:53:44,941 --> 01:53:45,467
Rym: Here's a video.

1784
01:53:45,507 --> 01:53:49,248
Scott: I have to say that Kotaku has the most humorous coverage.

1785
01:53:49,268 --> 01:53:58,098
Scott: they have things like a video of the food and a video of the line Joystick and engage you I think have the best real serious coverage so far.

1786
01:53:59,022 --> 01:54:02,314
Scott: So check them out if you actually care about things and not don't just want to laugh.

1787
01:54:02,936 --> 01:54:04,841
