1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,147
Scott: It's Monday July 2nd.

2
00:00:11,548 --> 00:00:12,110
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:14,297
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:19,800
Scott: tonight We discussed democracy on tech news sites like dig and slash dot.

5
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:25,397
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,206
Scott: So rims got this fancy new computer.

7
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:33,772
Scott: I do it's finally working enough.

8
00:00:33,912 --> 00:00:37,200
Rym: I guess I've been playing a half-life 2 quite a bit though.

9
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:44,080
Rym: Now I want to hold out playing half-life 2 fully and all the way until I have the widescreen monitor to go with it.

10
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:45,567
Scott: That's a good call.

11
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:48,200
Scott: Yeah call cuz it gets pretty intense.

12
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:55,920
Rym: But at least now you recognize the amazing this that is half-life - oh, I recognized all along I've wanted to play half-life - since it came out.

13
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:56,442
Scott: I don't know.

14
00:00:56,503 --> 00:01:00,220
Scott: you used to always diss these single-player FPS's if they were not worth your time.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:11,493
Rym: Well, you know what other than half-life and half-life - and the possible possible exception of doom - though Only due to nostalgia and the fact that it's one of the only games like that.

16
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:13,500
Rym: They aren't they're terrible.

17
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:16,725
Scott: I think that System shock the game.

18
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:18,091
Scott: that's like the great game.

19
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:18,895
Scott: We haven't played.

20
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:19,999
Scott: I have hopes for that.

21
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:21,088
Scott: You know cuz it.

22
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,319
Scott: people won't shut up about it.

23
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:23,304
Rym: We'll see cuz.

24
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:28,091
Rym: we've had a lot of times in the past where people wouldn't shut up about a game And we finally just say alright.

25
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:32,070
Rym: We'll play it and a lot of times They're not as great as they were universally acclaimed.

26
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:33,737
Scott: for me to dismiss it like that.

27
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:39,640
Rym: No yeah You know what World of Warcraft is pretty universally Yeah, no, and it's not universally acclaimed.

28
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:40,624
Scott: I haven't seen any.

29
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:44,580
Scott: so you know there's just as many people saying wow sucks as people saying wow is awesome.

30
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:46,970
Scott: in fact a lot of you who play Wow say wow sucks.

31
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,323
Scott: yeah, but System Shock 2 is Universally revered.

32
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:52,748
Scott: I've never seen anyone say it suck.

33
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:55,778
Rym: anyway, so I imagine you brought up my computer for a reason.

34
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:59,309
Scott: yes So my computer not so awesome.

35
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:00,513
Scott: I mean it's not bad.

36
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:01,295
Scott: It's not bad.

37
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,060
Scott: I only bought it two or three years.

38
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:03,704
Rym: It's still good.

39
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:04,368
Scott: It's still good.

40
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:05,093
Scott: It is still good.

41
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:11,246
Scott: I mean it's got a XP 2500 plus processor which is so fast But it's one point eight gigahertz.

42
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:12,270
Scott: It's fast enough.

43
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:15,040
Scott: It's got you know enough hard drives.

44
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:18,800
Scott: I just filled up one of them, so I could just buy another one, and I'll be all set big deal.

45
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:26,560
Scott: It's got a geforce fx 5900 which well not exactly you know the fastest car in the universe.

46
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,655
Scott: They're only on the 7900 or eight thousand something now.

47
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:32,060
Scott: I'm not too far behind.

48
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,926
Scott: I can still play half-life 2 just fine.

49
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:37,397
Scott: That's not a problem, but I only got 512 megs of RAM.

50
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,889
Rym: Wow even even on my old computer.

51
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:49,220
Scott: I had a gig and even when I'm using Linux and Just browsing the web or listening to music it kind of fills up.

52
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,003
Scott: And it's not enough.

53
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,008
Rym: now think about that.

54
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,707
Rym: used to be just fine with 16 Yeah, oh yeah, and now makes a ram.

55
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:58,996
Scott: I could play mech warrior 2 now two gigs for me.

56
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:00,200
Rym: I use it all.

57
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:15,680
Scott: Yeah, so I had to decide because my computer takes DDR 400 RAM Which is sort of old and busted and it only takes two sticks of DDR 400. if I want to use three sticks I have to use DDR 333 which is significantly slower.

58
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:20,274
Scott: So I already have two sticks that are 256 megabytes each.

59
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:24,420
Scott: so if I want to replace the RAM I've got to buy two new sticks and get rid of the two old sticks.

60
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:26,551
Scott: Which there's nothing wrong with the two old sticks.

61
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,274
Scott: They work fine.

62
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:28,420
Scott: They're actually pretty high quality.

63
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:33,646
Scott: So I had to decide am I gonna buy two new sticks Or am I gonna buy a new computer?

64
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:45,695
Rym: when you know half-life 2 episode 2 and portal and all those things come out now you Buying a new computer would have completely cocked up the system because Scott and I have a tradition For as long as we've known each other of at any given point.

65
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:51,560
Rym: one of us has a computer That's very old and one of us has recently bought a brand new super fast computer.

66
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:57,301
Rym: Yeah, so I got to RIT with like the machine of the gods and Scott had his old Pentium 3.

67
00:03:57,301 --> 00:04:08,639
Rym: Then when my computer was still the machine of the gods But much weaker gods, maybe not the best gods anymore Scott bought a new computer that was like eight times faster than mine and then Rym bought this.

68
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,880
Scott: Yep, but I have a laptop but that laptop isn't really so fast either.

69
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,629
Rym: But if you buy a computer, it'll be the same speed as mine.

70
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:16,815
Rym: because you know about technology.

71
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:18,079
Rym: you'd buy the same processor.

72
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:21,993
Rym: Maybe maybe you'd buy the one the 50 instead of the.

73
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:23,217
Rym: oh, oh, but I made.

74
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,385
Rym: I probably would actually yeah But that's the only difference.

75
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:26,732
Rym: we buy the same basic computer.

76
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:35,080
Scott: The point is I Decided it was a tough decision whether to upgrade and get more RAM and another hard drive or to just wait it out.

77
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:36,627
Scott: And I said, you know what?

78
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:39,640
Scott: I'm gonna buy the RAM and I bought it today.

79
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:46,779
Scott: I bought the cheapest possible two gigs of RAM a new egg that would go in my computer and I hope they saw up.

80
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:49,570
Rym: What shady brand did you end up picking?

81
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:50,695
Scott: That's a good question.

82
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:58,042
Scott: Let me look at my G. You don't even remember it was the shadiest brand available for the type of and size of RAM I needed.

83
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:03,240
Rym: yeah, it's tough because some of the things that look shady are actually fairly legit nowadays.

84
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:11,573
Rym: It is very difficult to tell and the people that used to be legit Went into the monster cable direction instead of into the quality direction.

85
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:13,097
Scott: Yeah, I hate that stuff.

86
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:14,019
Scott: It's pretty sucky.

87
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:15,946
Rym: I've already lost interest.

88
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:19,880
Scott: I know I know I just got like four new egg emails and get figure out which whatever.

89
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:21,607
Rym: You probably don't want to give them any publicity.

90
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:24,056
Scott: Anyway, it's g-skill Ram.

91
00:05:24,177 --> 00:05:27,770
Scott: Oh, they're not so bad Yeah, but it wasn't like the ones with the fancy heat spreaders.

92
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,877
Scott: it was just two bare sticks.

93
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,367
Scott: Wow Yeah, we'll see how it works.

94
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:33,030
Scott: If it doesn't work.

95
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,500
Scott: I'll just return it and give up and keep the hard drive.

96
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:44,189
Rym: So last year around this time we did a show where we had two friends of ours who are also podcasters Do our show.

97
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:46,580
Rym: they were guest hosts on our show while we were out of town.

98
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:50,614
Rym: It was Richard and Allison from simply syndicated calm movies.

99
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,300
Rym: You should see you should check them out.

100
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,111
Rym: They're one of my favorite podcasts and they're awesome.

101
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:57,168
Rym: Yeah, two of them specifically Yeah, but basically we go away.

102
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:57,851
Rym: you all suck.

103
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:03,350
Scott: every year after Otakon We are we go to a undisclosed vacation spot.

104
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:04,573
Scott: Yes entire week.

105
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:07,000
Rym: It's kind of like the South Park writers really undisclosed.

106
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,388
Scott: We've said it many times before I'm just being silly.

107
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:10,793
Rym: It's the front row crew.

108
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:11,716
Rym: writers retreat.

109
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:21,663
Scott: Yes, so While we're away on this vacation far away hiding we can't really make shows and we don't really feel like making a bunch of shows In advance.

110
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:28,680
Scott: so last year we said alright anyone who wants to make an episode of GeekNights We don't want you to make an episode of your show.

111
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,716
Scott: We want you to make an episode of GeekNights for one of the days of the week And then we'll put it up instead of the GeekNights by us.

112
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:39,390
Scott: and last year We got one taker on our offer.

113
00:06:39,652 --> 00:06:41,780
Rym: However, the one taker happened to be awesome.

114
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,660
Scott: It was one high quality taker and then we decide we had to fill in the other three days.

115
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:47,730
Scott: So you made shit.

116
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,739
Scott: two-minute episodes.

117
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:53,389
Rym: I remember our Thursday was 45 seconds long.

118
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,996
Scott: I think that was a day before.

119
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:57,585
Rym: that wasn't the Thursday during It's still part of the week.

120
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:58,327
Scott: It is part of it.

121
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:02,400
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, so this year we want more than one taker.

122
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,583
Scott: We've already got one taker.

123
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,406
Scott: I think yes.

124
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:10,873
Rym: so far the people we've got lined up to do the anime night are pretty hardcore And I think you're gonna like him.

125
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:14,620
Rym: I think their Style really jives well with the GeekNights format.

126
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:25,420
Scott: yeah, so if you want to make a Monday show a Tuesday show or a Thursday show of GeekNights and You just want to do that then email us or something.

127
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:31,964
Rym: However, I'll point out that just because you email us don't feel bad if we say no because there are some mean you're free To make a show.

128
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:35,019
Scott: Yeah, we're just not gonna put it on our site in our feed if we don't like it.

129
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:42,660
Rym: There are some undisclosed requirements many of them having to do with intelligence and audio quality and technical aptitude.

130
00:07:43,284 --> 00:07:50,058
Scott: Yes, so if you fail to meet the requirements I mean anyone is free to just make GeekNights episodes and remixes all you want.

131
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:52,005
Scott: go nuts That'll only make us more popular.

132
00:07:52,025 --> 00:08:01,460
Scott: Yeah, as if you make a really good funny remix and it's on the YouTube or something, but For us to select it as to be in an actual real episode of GeekNights.

133
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:03,080
Scott: It's got to be something special.

134
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,829
Scott: But don't don't let that scare you into not asking.

135
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,380
Scott: ask because only one person did it last year.

136
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,175
Scott: So maybe no one will do it and you'll be the only one and we'll let you do it.

137
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:14,440
Scott: Anyway, you suck.

138
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,666
Rym: Ah, we'll see.

139
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:16,189
Rym: We'll see.

140
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,420
Rym: it depends a lot on who you are and how we're feeling.

141
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,366
Scott: Yes, but don't hesitate to ask.

142
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:23,496
Rym: I also enjoy just making the 32nd episode and putting it up.

143
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:24,399
Scott: Yeah, those are fun, too.

144
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:28,792
Rym: But anyway in the news, I thought this was kind of interesting.

145
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:31,620
Rym: I think it bodes somewhat poorly for Universal.

146
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:33,578
Rym: They've decided not to renew.

147
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:38,955
Rym: According to slash dot their contract with Apple for their content on I have they actually like.

148
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:43,414
Scott: I saw a rumor that was like universal Might not renew or universal threatening to not renew.

149
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:44,179
Scott: Did they actually?

150
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:45,805
Scott: Officially not renew?

151
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,892
Rym: the last I saw was to quote slash shot.

152
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:50,220
Rym: It appears for the moment that Universal will not renew.

153
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:53,850
Scott: Oh, well, that's that's the end of their music pretty much.

154
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,635
Rym: Uh, I don't know what they're thinking.

155
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,039
Rym: CD sales are down.

156
00:08:57,642 --> 00:09:05,700
Rym: iTunes is much of the music market nowadays and How else they can second after Walmart, so they're probably still gonna rock Walmart.

157
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:08,310
Scott: So they'll make their money there, but they're not down.

158
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:09,957
Scott: It's got going down constant.

159
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:10,800
Rym: It's not gonna last.

160
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:17,800
Scott: Yeah, basically what this amounts to is imagine if there was the Pony Express and then they invented the truck.

161
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:25,046
Scott: So there are three male companies and one of them all of them upgrade to trucks Right, and then one of them says fuck these trucks.

162
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,128
Scott: I'm going back to ponies.

163
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:27,410
Scott: That's what this is.

164
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:30,429
Scott: It's kind of obvious what's gonna happen.

165
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,540
Scott: All the ponies are gonna get run over by the trucks.

166
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:36,373
Rym: Well what they might be thinking is they're trying to exert pressure on Apple.

167
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:45,120
Rym: because you see the real point of contention Other than DRM is the fact that Apple will not let people charge more for their music.

168
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,306
Rym: They have fun at all.

169
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:46,648
Scott: Yep.

170
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:47,553
Scott: It's a dollar Perry.

171
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:48,860
Rym: You can charge less, but you can't charge.

172
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,997
Scott: Well, I think you get a discount if you buy the whole album.

173
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,874
Rym: No, no I mean you can say your music cost less than a dollar.

174
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:56,960
Rym: Okay, and you I don't know But you can't say it costs more than a dollar.

175
00:09:57,201 --> 00:10:00,311
Scott: Well, actually I think the non DRM music cost slightly more than a doll.

176
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,355
Rym: Yeah, but that's still so.

177
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:02,840
Rym: even then it's a flat price.

178
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:03,729
Rym: they can't change it.

179
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:08,440
Rym: Yep, and They don't like this because they want to charge you a lot more money.

180
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,856
Rym: They feel that a song is worth more than 99 cents.

181
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:18,556
Scott: They also feel that you know because a song is brand new from like Britney Spears It should be more money than an old cruddy song.

182
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:20,064
Scott: No one likes I.

183
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:25,104
Rym: just I really wonder what they're thinking because Apple I know Couldn't care less.

184
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:27,171
Rym: They have the music industry by the balls.

185
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:33,877
Scott: I'm beginning to feel that Cuz cuz we saw that record company guy at RIT.

186
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:38,756
Rym: remember him Oh the guy who wouldn't answer my question because I happen to be wearing a skull and bones.

187
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:51,840
Scott: Yeah that guy You know that guy he wasn't totally aware of you know, everything that we know, but he wasn't completely stupid either You know and I got to assume that the other record executives are at least as smart as he is.

188
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,546
Scott: Maybe a little dumber maybe a little smarter right?

189
00:10:54,048 --> 00:11:10,419
Scott: I'm beginning to think that at this point the record executives Realize that there is absolutely no way to save their sinking ship and they're just trying to get as many Nice paintings and statues and jewels and fineries off of that ship before it sinks seat.

190
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:15,760
Rym: now I do want to point out that I don't think that the idea of selling music is the sinking ship.

191
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:31,680
Rym: I think the sinking ship is the current model of the music industry Which is get a band make them super super popular and sell a million of their CDs as opposed to the future Which is probably the long tail of many many many bands each doing a little bit of music and making a little bit of money.

192
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:37,617
Scott: Yes I think the days of because I think the one problem is that you had with music sit.

193
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:49,573
Scott: ever since Elvis the music industry worked in such a way that someone had to become a star a rock star who had a lot of money and Glamour and fame and huge arena concerts and all that jazz.

194
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:57,700
Scott: and I think for now on Yeah, still some of those people will emerge, you know, if someone gets stupidly popular all across the internets or whatever.

195
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:07,159
Scott: But for the most part, you know There are gonna be musicians who are popular enough and they're gonna make the same amount of money that you and I make.

196
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:10,040
Scott: they're gonna Make a decent living just doing normal business.

197
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:17,353
Rym: Well, the only reason the music industry ended up being the way it was was simply that before the internet You couldn't get played on the radio.

198
00:12:17,393 --> 00:12:23,040
Rym: You couldn't get gigs You couldn't do anything more than play for like the county fair and in Peoria.

199
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,679
Rym: Yeah, unless you went to the music industry and said I'm gonna sign away all my rights make me famous.

200
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,065
Rym: Nowadays, we have YouTube.

201
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:35,336
Rym: if a band's good enough and they put themselves on the internet.

202
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:36,320
Rym: They'll become popular.

203
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:45,200
Scott: So what we had before Actually was a system in which you were either super rich and famous or you weren't cutting it as a musician alone.

204
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,600
Scott: You had to do something else on the side, you know, maybe a radio DJ or maybe working a McDonald's a radio DJ.

205
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,524
Rym: Those still exist.

206
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:52,905
Scott: Yeah.

207
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:53,207
Scott: Yeah.

208
00:12:53,709 --> 00:13:01,960
Scott: Well in the I'm talking about back in the day and then Nowadays, we're moving towards a system in which pretty much most of the musicians will there.

209
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:05,080
Scott: You know, if you're a good music, of course, if you suck, you're not gonna make anything.

210
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,184
Scott: That's still gonna be the case.

211
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:10,780
Scott: But if you're okay, and you have talent, you're probably and you you're not stupid.

212
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:22,839
Scott: You're probably gonna make enough money to live from your music and no one very few people much fewer than you know back in the 70s or 80s will get stupidly rich just from being a musician.

213
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:36,080
Scott: and it's kind of funny because it's basically a combination of capitalism and technology That make the playing field even as whereas normally you would think that communism or socialism would do something like that.

214
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:39,793
Rym: Now you see what we have here with Universal.

215
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,499
Rym: I'm going on a different tack with this.

216
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:50,824
Rym: now all right is basically a real-world example of the prisoners dilemma because Universal has said all right We're defecting from Apple.

217
00:13:51,486 --> 00:14:01,517
Rym: if every other or at least if a few of the other labels decided, you know, what we're with you We're defecting - then they all win collectively and Apple loses.

218
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:04,043
Rym: However There's a choice now.

219
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:09,800
Rym: if all the other labels say, you know what we're gonna let universal love twist in the wind a little bit.

220
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:15,980
Rym: Then basically they defect against universal and they all stand to gain because they look better for the tech crowd.

221
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:19,514
Rym: They now have more presence in the market because they're still on iTunes.

222
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:20,980
Rym: They're still on Apple's good side.

223
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:27,620
Rym: They can even run the PR machine to sell the fact that they're not evil like universal and they're not backwards like universal.

224
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:33,980
Scott: Well, it all started with the original prisoners dilemma of there's a bunch of record companies who's gonna sign with Apple?

225
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:38,456
Scott: Yeah, and one person signed and then they all went and now one person leaves.

226
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:39,680
Scott: Will they all leave?

227
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:40,644
Scott: I don't know.

228
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:42,276
Rym: I think I'm gonna say no.

229
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:50,632
Rym: Yeah It is my opinion that the rest of the music industry is at least smart enough to realize that without Apple They're gonna have a lot of trouble.

230
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:57,520
Scott: Yeah, and I think Any record company that's planning to stay with Apple is more than happy to let the others leave.

231
00:14:58,062 --> 00:15:01,120
Rym: Yeah, because that means they would like more market share more promotion.

232
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:04,560
Scott: They would like nothing more than to be the only record label on Apple.

233
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:08,070
Scott: All right, speaking of selling musics.

234
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:10,378
Scott: You may or may not know of a website.

235
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:16,738
Scott: It's pretty popular That everyone who's on the Internet's probably knows about it called all of mp3.

236
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:22,710
Rym: It was one of the great old, uh, I don't know I want to call it Soviet, but it's not really.

237
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:27,790
Rym: it's just one of those shady Russian or pocknerian Deals that was going around back in the day.

238
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:30,466
Scott: Well, it was going around for a long time It wasn't.

239
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:31,419
Scott: you know, it wasn't too old.

240
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,584
Scott: It's only a few years old but

241
00:15:33,206 --> 00:15:34,933
Rym: that's back in the day as first the internet

242
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:50,236
Scott: of this site was that in Russia The laws about copyright and royalties for music and stuff like that are different from the US and due to a legal loophole They were able to make a website where you could download pretty much any music you wanted.

243
00:15:50,477 --> 00:16:04,545
Scott: that was you know Popular record company music because they didn't have rare indie musics there so much and you could pay a price like 25 cents for a song and you could get any format at any bit rate you wanted and of course height they would charge like by how much?

244
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:11,857
Scott: so if you got like a flack of like a Half hour song that would cost a lot more than a shitty mp3 of a two-minute song.

245
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:12,820
Rym: course a lot more.

246
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,784
Rym: It was still nothing.

247
00:16:13,864 --> 00:16:16,032
Scott: It was still like less than a dollar for most songs.

248
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:28,026
Scott: like albums were less than five hours and The problem with all of mp3 of course is that all the other countries, you know, Russia didn't like it so much but there's nothing they could do about it really and You know in order.

249
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:40,418
Scott: Russia wanted to join the World Trade Organization but they couldn't because this site was still there and like you can't join the World Trade or trade organization if You know part if your country is doing things that are piracy related.

250
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:46,265
Rym: granted It wasn't just all of mp3 that was keeping Russia out of the no But it was a factor.

251
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:50,800
Scott: it was something that the politicians involved in that sort of thing knew about and brought up.

252
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:58,860
Rym: It was just the fact that things like this Existed and Russia wasn't doing anything about it because there were a lot of shady outfits very similar to this in Russia.

253
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,652
Scott: Oh, yeah all over the place, but this is one that was of note.

254
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:03,260
Scott: It was probably the biggest one actually.

255
00:17:03,962 --> 00:17:09,863
Scott: Well today Russia finally shut down all of mp3 Permanently.

256
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:12,112
Scott: forever it's gone the end.

257
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:13,758
Rym: didn't that happen before?

258
00:17:13,778 --> 00:17:22,146
Scott: well It's been shut down temporarily at times and but it's always crawled back from the dead And now it is finally all the way gone.

259
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,032
Rym: Maybe it will reappear in Ukraine.

260
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:24,534
Scott: Well.

261
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:26,339
Scott: No it will not reappear in Ukraine.

262
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,015
Scott: however We don't know how.

263
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:29,358
Scott: you know.

264
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:29,963
Scott: well We don't know.

265
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:31,634
Scott: I guess it could just reappear.

266
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:35,511
Scott: that might happen But it seems it at least it seems to me that they've.

267
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:39,466
Scott: they've sealed the legal loophole that locks MP3 all of mp3 away.

268
00:17:39,948 --> 00:17:46,772
Scott: however the same people who made all of mp3 Have made another site called mp3 sparks.

269
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:49,280
Scott: It's launched by the same people.

270
00:17:50,002 --> 00:18:00,111
Scott: It's not illegal under Russian law because they use a different licensing model and a different loophole And you can still get albums for like $3 outstanding.

271
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:05,400
Scott: so Everyone change your bookmarks from all of mp3 calm to mp3 sparks.

272
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:09,897
Rym: And I had read the news, so I didn't realize that part.

273
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:13,228
Scott: yeah Yeah, actually there's another.

274
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:18,629
Scott: there's a. there's an old story like in in the article I'm reading about all of mp3 being shut down.

275
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,117
Scott: There's actually a story that is kind of old But I didn't know about it until just now.

276
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:32,240
Scott: Apparently there's a Danish internet service provider called perspective and a while ago They decided to block all of mp3 for their users.

277
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:36,454
Scott: So no one using perspective as their ISP could get to all of mp3.

278
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:38,340
Rym: calm wow I wonder why they would do that.

279
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,614
Rym: I can see almost no incentive unless our government was leaning on you right.

280
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:48,198
Rym: well the Pirate Bay Working together with pirates Byron did they give people access to it through the Pirate Bay?

281
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:50,327
Scott: no No, that would have been one thing.

282
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:51,733
Scott: I would have thought is that they would proxy.

283
00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:52,838
Scott: You know the all of mp3?

284
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:58,160
Scott: Yeah, instead they blocked all of perspectives customers from getting to the Pirate Bay.

285
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,613
Scott: Hahaha, so basically the Pirate Bay if you went to perspective it wouldn't let you in.

286
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:08,768
Scott: not long after that perspective Opened up all of mp3 again.

287
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:09,651
Rym: I wonder why.

288
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:11,237
Scott: yeah think about that.

289
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:16,080
Scott: Pirate Bay Is that powerful with their bit torrents of illegalness that they can force?

290
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:21,495
Rym: In a what are you talking about the Pirate Bay does not violate any laws.

291
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:22,900
Scott: It doesn't which is awesome.

292
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:26,909
Scott: And There's think about it was like an act of piracy.

293
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:39,228
Scott: they sailed up with their pirate boat and they menaced That's this Danish internet service provider and rather than be boarded and skewered and be have all their loots Taken they gave in to the pirates.

294
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:53,223
Rym: I gotta say regardless of whether or not you agree or disagree with the Motivation and and the modus operandi of the Pirates Bay you have to respect the testicular fortitude They have shown to us.

295
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:54,505
Scott: They're my kind of people.

296
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:02,060
Rym: This is Sparta.

297
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:05,625
Scott: That's not good There's so.

298
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:14,180
Rym: we were talking about this a little while ago But it surprises us the sheer number of Sparta remixes of things on the internet.

299
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:18,249
Scott: What is it about that 300 movie that makes it so remixable?

300
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:25,951
Scott: I mean usually I'll be like, oh that is so remixable, right but Like take for example snakes on a plane.

301
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:30,848
Scott: the idea of snakes on a plane was super remixable But the actual movie not so much.

302
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,113
Scott: for some reason 300.

303
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:34,963
Scott: I Don't know why.

304
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:35,867
Scott: what what about it?

305
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:38,176
Scott: I think why is it out of control?

306
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,180
Rym: Here's my hypothesis.

307
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:49,379
Rym: I believe that the reason Sparta is so remixable aside from the homo eroticism and the fighting and the violence and These silly lines yelled at each other and all that business.

308
00:20:50,143 --> 00:20:59,980
Rym: The guy's face is one of those Lord of the Rings on the go faces and It has been used in the Lord of the Rings on the go face humor way for great effect.

309
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,749
Scott: I suppose so.

310
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,368
Scott: but I definitely did not see this Fad coming of remixing the Sparta.

311
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:09,400
Rym: I think it just comes down to people yelled in Sparta a lot.

312
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:22,440
Rym: well in 300, I guess they yelled in Sparta a lot too, but There's a lot of yelling and it seems like whenever someone yells in a thing and you want to remix it What better thing to have them yell then something from Sparta?

313
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,444
Scott: So what's it?

314
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:29,600
Scott: so what you think of it is I imagine it's some sort of art or remix.

315
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:32,048
Rym: We came upon this somewhat by accident.

316
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:33,532
Rym: We were watching dramatic.

317
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:34,576
Rym: Look for some reason.

318
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:35,900
Rym: I think you all know what you're mad at.

319
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:43,594
Rym: And Then we saw dramatic look remix, which was a short remix.

320
00:21:43,615 --> 00:21:45,440
Rym: That was basically that plus a lightsaber.

321
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:46,704
Scott: it was high quality.

322
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:51,439
Rym: and then we noticed in the related a Sparta remix that was actually quite long.

323
00:21:51,459 --> 00:22:06,509
Rym: and while this is probably only going to be funny once I recommend that you watch it all the way through and There's a point at which it becomes Lord of the Rings on the go and I could not help but laugh out loud Uncontrollably when that happened.

324
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:12,020
Scott: Yeah, this is a pretty good one And then we tried to find more of these and the other ones kind of sucked.

325
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:14,831
Scott: So this is the best one you're gonna get on YouTube for now.

326
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,960
Scott: someone might up top it soon.

327
00:22:17,382 --> 00:22:18,489
Rym: I wouldn't be that hard to top it.

328
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,300
Rym: We could top it if we were doing a show.

329
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:22,419
Scott: We don't have video editing action or skills.

330
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:34,188
Rym: The real issue here is I noticed that I found two not one but two other videos on YouTube That were actually the same video as this With a different song and like.

331
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,540
Rym: they cut off the end or the front and I don't get that.

332
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:39,750
Rym: It's like they remixed the remix.

333
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,723
Scott: Well by remixing a remix isn't so bad But they did.

334
00:22:42,743 --> 00:22:44,753
Rym: problem is in such as I barely barely changed it.

335
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,159
Scott: It's like some guy edited all this video together and some guy just changed the song and put it back up.

336
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,086
Rym: Plus even this I got to admit.

337
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:55,975
Rym: Well, I don't get why for several seconds.

338
00:22:56,015 --> 00:22:57,580
Rym: We just see Phoenix Wright standing there.

339
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,083
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

340
00:22:58,103 --> 00:23:08,180
Rym: I don't understand that either and then I really don't get Why they showed the clip of Batman running away from phantos completely unedited and in its entirety.

341
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:09,384
Scott: Yeah, I don't understand that.

342
00:23:09,444 --> 00:23:15,085
Rym: either now if you were to replace the phantos head with a Sparta head That would have been great.

343
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:22,062
Rym: or if you'd been carrying the Sparta head running away from a Sparta head or if Batman had had a Sparta head I would have just had the The.

344
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,351
Scott: what's the groundhog thing the prairie dog?

345
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:25,937
Scott: Yeah, I would have had it do the.

346
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:32,649
Scott: you know The look with some sort of Batman added to it Uh-huh, like, you know, I don't know.

347
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:33,512
Rym: I don't know.

348
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:35,660
Rym: I just would have taken that gif and added Sparta to it.

349
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,403
Rym: I don't know why they didn't.

350
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:37,207
Scott: Yeah.

351
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:39,960
Rym: Yeah, I don't get there's a the middle bit of this.

352
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,091
Rym: There's no way you won't laugh at it with a little go-kart thing.

353
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:44,437
Rym: and then the panda jack-in-the-box.

354
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:50,180
Rym: Yeah They replaced the sneezing panda with a jack-in-the-box or the or the football players at the end.

355
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,651
Rym: I think that's when I really lost it.

356
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:55,579
Scott: Yeah, they're alright, too Alright, so that's a funny video right there.

357
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:57,859
Scott: But I think I've realized something.

358
00:23:58,802 --> 00:24:05,119
Scott: You know how we often use Japanese television as things today, you know We often use YouTube and dig videos as things of the day.

359
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,460
Rym: Well Japanese television is awesome and YouTube is the closest thing we have in America to that.

360
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,788
Scott: That's what I just realized recently.

361
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:15,100
Scott: is that Japanese television apparently I guess forever.

362
00:24:15,782 --> 00:24:16,765
Scott: I don't know when it started.

363
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:19,593
Scott: It's basically the same stuff that's on YouTube.

364
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:22,100
Scott: It's just like a bunch of thrown together hilarity.

365
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:28,980
Rym: Yeah, the worst part is it's usually it shows that like game shows that are set up to create those situations.

366
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,200
Rym: It's like they do it on purpose.

367
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:35,920
Scott: Yeah, it's like if youtubers had enough money and they could make a living for just making funny videos.

368
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:38,694
Scott: They basically just recreate Japanese television.

369
00:24:38,714 --> 00:24:39,659
Rym: I think so.

370
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:43,339
Scott: So here's something funny from Japanese television that I thought was kind of cool.

371
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:50,764
Scott: There's a guy in a zoo and there's a gorilla in the cage and the guy's got a hose and I think it's his job To clean the gorilla cage.

372
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:51,727
Scott: slash the gorilla.

373
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:55,660
Scott: So he sprays the water at the gorilla and the cage and the gorillas in a cage.

374
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,403
Scott: It's not gonna hurt him.

375
00:24:56,443 --> 00:24:57,609
Scott: It's not a mean gorilla either.

376
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:06,279
Scott: So there's no blood and gore in this one and The gorilla realizes that the floor is getting all slippery from the water.

377
00:25:07,283 --> 00:25:12,866
Scott: so the gorilla starts to do some funny stuff with a slippery floor and Just watch the video.

378
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:14,955
Scott: It is the entertaining a couple times.

379
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:24,130
Rym: Yes, is that I Liked videos like this when it chose a monkey or an ape or gorilla or any sort of animal Exhibiting that sort of?

380
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,340
Rym: I don't know intelligence and love of fun.

381
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:28,389
Rym: Did it bump up?

382
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:28,630
Rym: bump?

383
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:51,660
Rym: Yeah, because that's still relevant Right, so instead of talking about how computers work because we've been doing that a lot lately We realized something that I mean a lot of people talk about this but I've been thinking about it more lately partly because I go to both sites about equally and Both of them are starting to annoy me for this for the same amount, but in different directions.

384
00:25:53,663 --> 00:26:01,139
Rym: I really think we just have to talk about dig and slash dot and internet democracy versus Push content and all that sort of business.

385
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:02,484
Scott: Well to introduce.

386
00:26:02,585 --> 00:26:07,020
Scott: basically you have websites on the internet that take those websites on the internet.

387
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,546
Scott: yes, their websites on the Internet and They have news on them.

388
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:13,480
Scott: some sites make news like CNN.

389
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,437
Scott: Well, I guess that no you see that I UPI and Associated Press make news.

390
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:24,160
Scott: local newspapers Also sometimes make shitty local news, but there are places that make news also like sometimes.

391
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:29,894
Scott: You know Engadget makes news like not so much as here is a fact we researched.

392
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,020
Scott: but here is an editorial type news.

393
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,883
Scott: You know something.

394
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:36,474
Scott: we you know reviewing a product that is new, you know something.

395
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,240
Scott: they wrote original content.

396
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:44,020
Scott: And then there are sites which take the content around the internet and sort of list it.

397
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,839
Scott: So that way you don't have to go to a hundred different sites to get all these newses.

398
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:55,860
Scott: One site collects all the best newses for you custom You know just similar to your interests and you can just go to one place one-stop shop.

399
00:26:56,687 --> 00:26:57,919
Scott: And he used to be back in the day.

400
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:07,970
Scott: one of the first places that did this in a good way was slash dot and slash dot would go around and I think the Slogan of slash that still is news for nerd stuff.

401
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:15,059
Scott: that matters right and they would go around finding news that nerds cared about the geeks cared about that.

402
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:17,307
Scott: Nerds and geeks think matters.

403
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:18,912
Rym: There wasn't a third kind.

404
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:19,414
Rym: Yep.

405
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:19,996
Rym: You're about.

406
00:27:20,016 --> 00:27:21,706
Rym: you're trying to say the third kind but there wasn't one.

407
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:25,652
Scott: there wasn't one and People would submit the stories to slash dot.

408
00:27:25,672 --> 00:27:29,005
Scott: so you would suggest hey slash dot why don't you put this on your site?

409
00:27:29,387 --> 00:27:36,006
Scott: and then pretty much every article in the entire known universe was always submitted and Then people at slash dot keep.

410
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:40,560
Scott: employees of slash dot would decide this news story will go on slash dot.

411
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,825
Scott: This one will not.

412
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:45,620
Scott: and you couldn't see which stories were approved or not approved.

413
00:27:45,941 --> 00:27:49,356
Scott: all you saw was which stories made it and which stories you submitted.

414
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:52,666
Scott: that's all you knew and It worked pretty well.

415
00:27:52,726 --> 00:27:56,100
Scott: slash that was the biggest things in sliced bread for years and years and years back.

416
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,393
Rym: Then it always had the news long before anyone else did.

417
00:27:58,453 --> 00:28:00,436
Rym: you didn't have to go digging for it It was just there.

418
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:07,660
Rym: Usually the commentary was somewhat insightful and the crowds the mobs the people posting and commenting on slash dot.

419
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:10,230
Rym: We're by and large pretty intelligent.

420
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:15,032
Rym: there's a lot of good humor there a lot of sense of community and The moderation system will get to that.

421
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:25,457
Scott: Yeah But people on slash dot they always said hey We don't like how these people at slash dot decide which goes on the site and which doesn't.

422
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:26,320
Scott: we want to decide?

423
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:28,278
Scott: Which news goes on the site and which doesn't.

424
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:29,905
Rym: yeah There's always the troubles with like.

425
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:39,640
Scott: they'd complain about Roland peak Paley or because like every day There would be another story from Roland peak Paley's blog and you'd be like why the fuck is that guy's blog always on slash?

426
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:39,840
Scott: Dot?

427
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,929
Rym: this is bullshit or people complain about dupes.

428
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:44,700
Scott: They'd complain about yeah, they'd be like hey, why is that story there?

429
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,644
Scott: That was already there.

430
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:46,467
Scott: It shouldn't be there again.

431
00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:47,531
Scott: These editors fucked up.

432
00:28:47,872 --> 00:28:48,575
Scott: We're smart enough.

433
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:49,539
Scott: We know that's a dupe.

434
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:50,744
Scott: Why are you putting it up?

435
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:52,893
Rym: or editors over editorial izing?

436
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:54,479
Rym: Yeah, all sorts of stuff like that.

437
00:28:55,141 --> 00:29:07,900
Scott: so for years and years and years people always had the idea that there should be some sort of slash dot with a voting system of What stories go to the front page and for some reason no one was ever actually smart enough to make it including me.

438
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:08,623
Scott: I could have done it.

439
00:29:09,065 --> 00:29:09,587
Scott: I just didn't.

440
00:29:09,688 --> 00:29:10,290
Scott: I was too dumb.

441
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:11,415
Scott: I didn't do it.

442
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:12,439
Scott: It could have been me.

443
00:29:12,822 --> 00:29:15,200
Scott: Yeah, you know what to be Scott Reuben and I Kevin Rose.

444
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:20,220
Rym: I think part of the reason I never thought about it at all was I didn't really care since I had FARC which wall.

445
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,512
Rym: It's definitely dictatorship like slash shot.

446
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:25,607
Rym: at the same time Everything funny was always there.

447
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:27,516
Scott: so I didn't care but I mean it was.

448
00:29:27,536 --> 00:29:28,480
Scott: it was so obvious.

449
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:29,670
Scott: Everyone wanted it.

450
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:35,800
Scott: No one did until dig and I'm sure dig wasn't the first one, you know, well there was corrosion.

451
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:41,682
Scott: You know corrosion was about fiction though and not so and about articles written by people and not about news Sure.

452
00:29:41,722 --> 00:29:43,620
Rym: It was a lot about nonfiction and commentary though.

453
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,225
Scott: Yeah editorials and things.

454
00:29:45,346 --> 00:29:48,696
Scott: you would write a story basically or an essay and put it on corrosion.

455
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:50,041
Scott: then people would vote it to the Top.

456
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:54,338
Scott: Yeah, you couldn't link to some news like hey vote this news article over there to the top.

457
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:54,860
Scott: that didn't work.

458
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,090
Scott: That wasn't what the site was about.

459
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,360
Rym: Yeah, thought no more personal note.

460
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:04,188
Rym: I can say that I have interacted with the corrosion community a few times in the last few months Mostly to get free copy editing on things.

461
00:30:04,248 --> 00:30:06,936
Rym: I write I just make an account and submit something and get.

462
00:30:07,518 --> 00:30:10,186
Rym: those are some Generally intense and scary people.

463
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:10,607
Rym: Yep.

464
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:17,348
Scott: Anyway, so eventually, you know some sites came out that were semi-democratic You know and different from slash.

465
00:30:17,368 --> 00:30:25,976
Scott: that I mean delicious was a site where you would bookmark, you know all you used it was to supplement your you know, normal bookmarks and They had a page.

466
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:27,783
Scott: that was the popular page and it would show.

467
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:29,650
Rym: I don't think we need to talk about any more history.

468
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:31,610
Rym: Yeah dig is the opposite of slash shot.

469
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,473
Rym: It's democratic.

470
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:45,670
Rym: instead of a select few choosing what the masses see based on submissions from the masses You have the masses choosing how popular something is by each giving it a little nudge up or a nudge down and that's it.

471
00:30:46,091 --> 00:30:57,769
Rym: And as a result now that we've had some time and these two sites are both firmly established still Slash shot is moving more and more toward news and commentary and editorial izing and that sort of thing.

472
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:06,281
Rym: and Dig is moving more and more not toward news but toward being like a snapshot of the zeitgeist that is the internet.

473
00:31:06,863 --> 00:31:13,624
Rym: you go to dig on any given day and look at what's at the Top and you pretty much know what the internet is talking about at that time.

474
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,346
Rym: What's popular?

475
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:15,570
Rym: What ideas are popular?

476
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,230
Rym: What ideas are unpopular?

477
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:19,197
Rym: What politicians are popular?

478
00:31:19,237 --> 00:31:21,324
Rym: among the kinds of people who read diggin slash dot?

479
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:23,130
Rym: you never got that on slash dot.

480
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,709
Rym: All you got was here's the news and as a result people only talked about the news.

481
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:33,205
Scott: Yep, I mean slash dot, you know used to be the place to go to find out things.

482
00:31:33,285 --> 00:31:37,710
Scott: now if it's on slash dot I know it already pretty much a hundred percent of the time.

483
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,040
Scott: I've already heard that news somewhere else.

484
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,029
Scott: slash that is no news to offer.

485
00:31:42,631 --> 00:31:58,870
Scott: Dig on the other hand, you know it tell you by looking at all the headlines and you can figure out what people who will use dig on the in the general geek internet community are thinking and what they agree with And what they disagree with and what they think is important what they don't think is important.

486
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:10,536
Scott: But you might also get a link to the news itself But these you're not gonna get anything else besides that the comments are basically just bleh Gosh dot.

487
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:14,213
Scott: the comments are still somewhat usable You know what?

488
00:32:14,534 --> 00:32:18,007
Rym: I'll say openly that the comments on FARC are more usable than dig.

489
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:19,532
Rym: Whoa Insult.

490
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:24,530
Rym: Yeah, I got insult because I got to get this on slash dot for a long time.

491
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:32,890
Rym: I was an uber moderator Which I didn't know that existed until we asked them at penguin con because I had had mod points continuously for like four months.

492
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,035
Rym: Yeah non-stop.

493
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:39,626
Rym: So we met the slash dot guys and I was like, uh Thing broken, how come I have infinite mod points?

494
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,674
Rym: They're like, oh well you're one of the blah and they explained it.

495
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:55,750
Rym: so I had the power to moderate slash dot as Much as I could and I realized that the amount of moderation you can do on slash dot Even if you have effectively infinite power is very minor because you can't do anything with the story.

496
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,058
Rym: You can only edit what people have commented on.

497
00:32:58,098 --> 00:33:01,228
Rym: you can't change a story so you can't pick what's popular.

498
00:33:01,288 --> 00:33:01,750
Rym: on slash dot.

499
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,110
Rym: You can only decide what people were writing better in the comments.

500
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:17,694
Rym: but even then you can only nudge things up a little tiny bit or nudging down a little tiny bit and It just didn't feel like it had any effect and I felt like it just wasn't worth it to bother the time It took to moderate.

501
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:20,827
Rym: I could have just gone somewhere else and done something better or more important.

502
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:24,450
Rym: dig Everyone can moderate everyone.

503
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:28,730
Rym: Finitely everyone on dig already has more power than I had on slash dot ever.

504
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:35,930
Rym: We can still only nudge anything up or down a little bit But you could nudge every single thing up if you want it or every single thing down.

505
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:42,443
Rym: As a result you start to see what ideas are popular and what ideas are not popular.

506
00:33:42,784 --> 00:33:45,571
Rym: in a way that could never happen on Slash dot.

507
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:52,710
Rym: on slash dot you only saw what ideas had piqued the interest of a moderator because not everyone could moderate.

508
00:33:53,232 --> 00:34:08,650
Rym: So in fact, we used to play a game Scott and I where it was who can have the longest uninterrupted streak of +5 comments The max you can get on slash dot and we realized that there was a specific Formula where you could say this is going to be a +5 post if I post it within the next two minutes.

509
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,650
Scott: Yep, you just had to post it early enough.

510
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,949
Scott: So if the story goes up you have to post your comment right away because that's when people are gonna see it.

511
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:17,364
Scott: You gotta post something that you know.

512
00:34:17,947 --> 00:34:23,889
Scott: either Agrees with that everyone is thinking and brings up, you know, the major points or you got to say something.

513
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:29,350
Scott: That's you know, like a new talking point that wasn't mentioned yet in the comments or something like that.

514
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,521
Scott: And pretty much every time I go all the way to +5.

515
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:34,755
Rym: Yeah, I filled my entire history once As a result good time.

516
00:34:35,016 --> 00:34:36,179
Rym: Yeah, but then slash shot.

517
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:42,440
Rym: while the comments that filter to the top are always very good They weren't really representative of what people thought.

518
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:48,969
Rym: they were just representative of the I guess Generally most learned commenting on the story at hand, which is useful.

519
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:56,888
Rym: But dig you can see very clear like for example Atheism is big on dig religion not so much our conspiracy theory.

520
00:34:56,947 --> 00:34:58,609
Rym: Yes It's definitely not.

521
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:12,129
Rym: You're starting to see that the internet the types of things that are popular and the types of people that are on the internet while very diverse have certain leanings and we never could really see this as Clearly as we can now with dig.

522
00:35:13,452 --> 00:35:15,643
Scott: Yeah, I think dig is very useful for that.

523
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:27,674
Scott: But on the other hand Sometimes you just get fed up with it because I want a site I want to be able to have you know, just a list of all the news as I care about with no news Is I don't care about.

524
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:31,829
Scott: you know and slash used to provide some of the news I cared about.

525
00:35:32,412 --> 00:35:34,261
Scott: almost no news I didn't care about.

526
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:40,869
Scott: as soon as I filtered out John Katz and They there was news I cared about they weren't putting up there mostly the non tech news.

527
00:35:41,492 --> 00:35:45,209
Scott: Dig has a lot of the news I care about in fact almost all of it.

528
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:50,931
Scott: But it also has a bunch of bullshit news that I want to get rid of very badly and it's very difficult to get rid Of it.

529
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:53,863
Rym: Like for example, I care a lot about political news in the United States.

530
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,289
Rym: I pay attention to that quite a bit.

531
00:35:56,352 --> 00:35:56,834
Rym: On dig.

532
00:35:57,256 --> 00:36:01,073
Rym: the only political news that ever gets dug up is I'm not like.

533
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:03,102
Rym: it's not like it leans a little to the left to the right.

534
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:04,990
Rym: It's pretty much nothing.

535
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:11,726
Rym: But oh my god this super obscure Underdog candidate is too awesome because of my blog post says.

536
00:36:11,787 --> 00:36:18,470
Rym: it says so That that they just be like links to crap blog posts and some bad grammar.

537
00:36:19,651 --> 00:36:21,118
Rym: Ron Paul is awesome.

538
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:23,309
Rym: dig this and a bunch of people would dig it.

539
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:28,069
Scott: Yeah, or there's people who made a website that was a link to the dig API.

540
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:38,281
Scott: So it check to see how many digs it has and based on how many digs it has it would show more dots in a picture And so if enough people dug the story you could see the whole picture.

541
00:36:38,803 --> 00:36:40,770
Scott: Yeah, that's really useful news.

542
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:42,660
Scott: I need that link in my RSS reader.

543
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:44,570
Scott: See I would have died without that one.

544
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:48,044
Rym: I don't mind seeing news that I don't actively care about.

545
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:49,430
Rym: I like to get just a picture of the world.

546
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,243
Rym: That's why I generally just read Google News for my world news.

547
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:55,337
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing though Is that there is news I care about.

548
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:56,683
Scott: that is not world news.

549
00:36:56,844 --> 00:36:59,434
Scott: So it's not in Google News, you know Like news about.

550
00:36:59,454 --> 00:37:03,024
Scott: you know computers and video games and all these sorts.

551
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:05,875
Rym: Yeah, you know what I go to multiple sites I do.

552
00:37:06,217 --> 00:37:08,409
Scott: I RSS many many sites Seattle and RSS.

553
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:18,845
Scott: But the thing is is that when you RSS something like say in gadget right and gadget reports on gadgets You know, but and they they're pretty good.

554
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:19,870
Scott: They're all really smart.

555
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:24,429
Scott: Everything they say is pretty respectful and intelligent and complete pretty much.

556
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:27,098
Scott: But there are a lot of things they don't cover.

557
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:30,830
Scott: and if I you know, I don't care about everything on engage.

558
00:37:31,131 --> 00:37:33,061
Scott: I only care about some of the things on a gadget.

559
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:44,548
Scott: and in order to get all the gadget news I cared about I would need like 15 gadget blogs and then a filter on each one to only get the bit of news on each blog that I want and That is why I don't use RSS.

560
00:37:45,172 --> 00:37:51,469
Rym: It's useless if I want to get all my news because all the sites I go to Have some unique news and then they dupe everything else.

561
00:37:51,891 --> 00:38:06,924
Rym: yep, but much more dear to me is simply the idea the comments because Usually a tech article is either crap or long or boring or doesn't have all the information or is biased or whatever And that's the reason I prefer to get all my tech news still from slash dot.

562
00:38:07,426 --> 00:38:19,356
Rym: if I go to slash dot I'm guaranteed that if I read the article and then I go to the comments if There was something wrong in the article or someone miss cited some comment will say this is wrong Every time.

563
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:26,664
Rym: the comments in slash dot will give me the whole story almost every single time and I don't need to do the research because it's there.

564
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:30,980
Rym: and I found over the years that I can generally Trust most of the research I find on slash dot.

565
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:45,690
Scott: We should have some sort of system where instead of commenting right we people will actually write the Text that should go up there as the description and then people moderate to see which description should be the one that replaces.

566
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:49,922
Scott: That way you'll get the whole story without having to read a second thing.

567
00:38:50,283 --> 00:38:50,965
Scott: That would be cool.

568
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,128
Rym: now dig.

569
00:38:52,208 --> 00:39:05,497
Rym: on the other hand The I learned that the only way to read dig comments is to immediately block Basically ban from you ever seeing again Anyone who is stupid immediately.

570
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:09,750
Rym: and I used to think that dig was this chaotic sea of jibbering idiots.

571
00:39:10,412 --> 00:39:27,068
Rym: And one day I decided that anytime I see someone who writes with poor grammar and spelling Writes a crap post like just like lol FTW OMG or something crap like that or just writes in Unpunctuated no capital letters garbage sentence or write something stupid.

572
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:34,609
Rym: or Anyone who believed in the autism vaccine link or anyone who was religious and espoused it on dig.

573
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:39,608
Rym: now I say and there they had to do both or I didn't care or in general just said anything stupid.

574
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,718
Rym: now Not something I disagreed with just something stupid.

575
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:49,547
Rym: if someone says something interesting about religion or posted something interesting Arguing for or against autism vaccines, whatever cool.

576
00:39:50,492 --> 00:39:56,036
Rym: But if what they said was stupid regardless of whether or not I agreed with them in principle I blocked them.

577
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,950
Rym: My block list is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds hundreds of people.

578
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:10,560
Rym: I blocked five or six people every single time I go to dig and I realized when I first did this I went into an article about autism and vaccines and I blocked everyone who was stupid.

579
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:22,399
Rym: and I noticed that I started seeing a good percentage fewer posts when I went to any other discussion and I realized that the majority of the crap on dig is caused by a Very small minority of the people on it.

580
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:24,630
Scott: Yeah, there are just a few people.

581
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:30,750
Scott: We've got nothing better to do and they're dumb and they write a bunch of shitty comments all over dig like crazy.

582
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:37,190
Scott: And if you just block those people all the comment sections start to clear up pretty nicely And it's not perfect.

583
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:38,450
Scott: But it's pretty it's not bad.

584
00:40:38,531 --> 00:40:47,534
Rym: It appears that if enough people block a person The person will end up being banned or something in some sort of algorithm that seems to be semi hidden But people have referenced it before.

585
00:40:47,554 --> 00:40:51,827
Rym: I implore all of you if someone is stupid on dig block them together.

586
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,916
Rym: We can end this Yep, not the general.

587
00:40:54,996 --> 00:41:00,030
Scott: the way I see it is that you know slashdot isn't perfect and dig isn't perfect.

588
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,606
Scott: They're really still even after getting what we wanted after all those years of slashdot.

589
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:05,308
Scott: We want to dig.

590
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:06,291
Scott: we asked for it We got it.

591
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:08,598
Scott: We still don't have exactly what we want.

592
00:41:08,658 --> 00:41:10,383
Scott: Nobody's really a hundred percent happy.

593
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:13,612
Rym: even better people complain just as much Slashdot.

594
00:41:13,652 --> 00:41:17,343
Rym: they always complain that the editors pick everything and they still complain to a degree.

595
00:41:17,604 --> 00:41:20,816
Scott: and now they complain the editors are The people.

596
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:23,470
Scott: the masses on dig are too stupid posted a bunch of crap.

597
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:33,690
Rym: Yep I mean if you go to dig so many people are just so fed up and they complain like how come everything on dig is pro Atheist how come everything on dig is left-leaning and how come everything on dig is sensationalist?

598
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,229
Rym: Yeah, and the answer is because that's what the people on dig believe.

599
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:42,265
Scott: I think while slashdot should stick around because we need something that does that.

600
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:46,058
Rym: Oh slashdot is still the best site All of them as far as I dig.

601
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:52,401
Scott: we need dig to stick around and it's in its pure democracy Forms so that we can see what people on the internet are feeling.

602
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:54,429
Scott: we can get the vibe of the mass, right?

603
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:58,566
Scott: I propose we need a third thing a third way.

604
00:41:58,747 --> 00:42:01,905
Rym: a third way Not the straightaways not the corners, but the third place.

605
00:42:01,945 --> 00:42:02,548
Scott: the third place.

606
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:04,990
Rym: You see the tires slash out of this whole thing.

607
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:09,330
Scott: There is one part that has no problems and that is the slashdot comment system.

608
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:15,737
Scott: The reason the slashdot comment system works is because it is democratic in a way Not purely democratic but democratic.

609
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:19,610
Scott: there is voting by the people using it as to what should go up and what you go down.

610
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:25,074
Scott: But not everyone gets to vote only the representatives get to vote Huh?

611
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:29,550
Scott: That's a really good idea of filtering out stupidity by having a representative democracy.

612
00:42:29,731 --> 00:42:30,213
Scott: I don't know.

613
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:33,045
Scott: has anyone ever thought of that crazy idea before?

614
00:42:33,065 --> 00:42:34,030
Scott: I don't think so.

615
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:40,750
Scott: Maybe some people that might have started a country that's been around for like 200 years and now isn't going away anytime soon.

616
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,693
Rym: There's nothing like that.

617
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:42,917
Rym: No, no, no.

618
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:43,359
Scott: Okay.

619
00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:44,904
Scott: Well since there's nothing like that.

620
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:53,329
Scott: No one can sue us for patent infringement That Uses a representative form of democracy to determine what should go up and what should go down.

621
00:42:53,972 --> 00:43:03,949
Scott: I guess people would only be able to vote on other people and then people who have a lot of votes from other people Would then actually get to vote on stories and comments and those sorts of things.

622
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:09,455
Rym: However, I mean, it'd be very difficult to pull that off Like diggin slash dot.

623
00:43:09,475 --> 00:43:14,108
Rym: I have to deal with the problems of people gaming the system to get more influence and things like that.

624
00:43:14,128 --> 00:43:21,630
Scott: Yep There are quite many more questions to answer before something like that is feasible possible and not broken.

625
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:31,123
Scott: But I think that is the the way to go in the long run is some sort of maybe you know I mean Netscape tried it where they just paid people to be the.

626
00:43:31,224 --> 00:43:32,308
Scott: you know, the influencers.

627
00:43:32,348 --> 00:43:32,930
Scott: that doesn't work.

628
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:34,215
Scott: You can't pay people.

629
00:43:34,235 --> 00:43:41,225
Scott: it has to be people doing it because they want to because those the only people who are gonna do it You know because if you're paid to do it, you don't really care how it turns out.

630
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:43,115
Scott: only people using it care How it turns out.

631
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:49,410
Rym: Yep, so like Wikipedia my worry though I mean slash dot does have that in the not really it's representative.

632
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:54,350
Rym: It's not a democracy in that moderators are chosen and then those moderators have power for a time.

633
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,610
Scott: Yes, but those moderators are chosen by an algorithm not by a human.

634
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:03,350
Rym: Oh, yeah, but the point is that people who moderate slash dot get sick of it and then don't bother anymore.

635
00:44:03,973 --> 00:44:13,860
Rym: And any time you rely on people to do something like that Where they have to make an effort as opposed to dig where it takes zero effort People eventually get sick of it and just stop doing it.

636
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,470
Rym: You have to always keep bringing in the flesh the fresh blood.

637
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:19,183
Scott: Well, you know this all comes into exactly.

638
00:44:19,244 --> 00:44:20,450
Scott: How are you going to implement this?

639
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:26,570
Scott: For example, I could implement a system that looks just like dig where everyone puts in the small effort of digging stories, right?

640
00:44:27,193 --> 00:44:30,690
Scott: But what it does is instead of every dig is one vote.

641
00:44:31,112 --> 00:44:35,930
Scott: What it could do is it could say all right who submitted that story and it got a lot of digs.

642
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:45,164
Scott: That must be a person that people like and then the people who submit stories that people like Their digs will actually matter in terms of putting things on the front page.

643
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:46,669
Scott: Whereas other people won't matter.

644
00:44:46,709 --> 00:44:51,749
Rym: really Well, the problem with that is that most people I think who post things on day or things that get dug up.

645
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:56,768
Rym: Basically do nothing all day but sit there and try to find the stories that'll get them dug up.

646
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:57,350
Scott: That's fine.

647
00:44:59,011 --> 00:45:05,030
Rym: But as a result they cater toward the sensationalist crap audience instead of I don't know me they do.

648
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:11,745
Scott: But I think having some sort of you know system like this or something I you know, I'm not gonna come up with the perfect answer here on the show.

649
00:45:11,785 --> 00:45:12,227
Scott: Forget about.

650
00:45:12,247 --> 00:45:14,459
Rym: well, you'd better Otherwise your crap your ideas crap.

651
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:15,243
Rym: You're a bad person.

652
00:45:15,444 --> 00:45:16,630
Scott: Yeah, my idea is crap.

653
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:18,805
Scott: It's only kept us going for how long.

654
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:20,334
Scott: and yeah It's only the.

655
00:45:20,374 --> 00:45:23,669
Scott: you know, the form of government used in most of the civilized world.

656
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,421
Rym: Scott we pay our representatives.

657
00:45:28,064 --> 00:45:28,708
Scott: That's true.

658
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:30,034
Scott: Yes We only pay them.

659
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:38,996
Rym: in fact decide that we're who we're going to pay Except that we don't really decide because the incumbency rate is in the 90% surround here I know but no one.

660
00:45:39,297 --> 00:45:40,220
Rym: most people don't decide.

661
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,484
Rym: No one cares on paper.

662
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,030
Rym: besides do you want?

663
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,009
Rym: I mean you see how the American government works?

664
00:45:45,532 --> 00:45:49,769
Rym: Do you want a site to end up as corrupt as that?

665
00:45:52,391 --> 00:45:58,030
Scott: Yeah, there I think there are ways we could do about it like maybe keep who the representatives are secret stuff like that.

666
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:03,810
Rym: The way you go about it is you have dig but behind the scenes you just completely rig the system secretly.

667
00:46:04,552 --> 00:46:09,308
Scott: That'd be alright, but I still I think but if you just rig the system you basically just made slash that.

668
00:46:09,348 --> 00:46:09,950
Scott: that looks like dig.

669
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,718
Rym: Yes, but then people don't complain as much.

670
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:17,070
Rym: yeah because they think they have control but they don't know.

671
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:22,990
Scott: I want to have you know, a representative system where you have people voting democratically to choose what goes there.

672
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:32,520
Scott: So that way you get a large quantity of content filtered down to just have the meat and potatoes But at the same time you're filtering out all the stupidity.

673
00:46:32,761 --> 00:46:36,955
Scott: So even if something is incredibly popular, but it's stupid as all hell It doesn't get up there.

674
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:38,321
Rym: You know what dig needs.

675
00:46:38,402 --> 00:46:41,897
Rym: very simply right now I can block a person and not see their comments.

676
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:46,658
Rym: if I block someone I shouldn't see their submitted digs No matter how dug up they get either.

677
00:46:46,759 --> 00:46:47,804
Scott: Maybe it works that way.

678
00:46:47,824 --> 00:46:48,810
Rym: No, I don't think it does.

679
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:52,107
Rym: Well, it should if it does because I see the same Doug stories as everyone else.

680
00:46:52,428 --> 00:46:58,909
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I mean you can filter out categories Which is huge because I don't want to see that stupid medicine and health category.

681
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:05,936
Rym: I know it's full of bullshit because all the time I bury everything and then I go in and block everyone who boasts Yeah, but that's not I don't.

682
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:07,221
Scott: I can't click that many times.

683
00:47:07,322 --> 00:47:09,310
Scott: I basically does not look at the bullshit.

684
00:47:09,571 --> 00:47:12,682
Rym: I stomp around dig with a sword just cleaving people left and right.

685
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:13,666
Scott: I don't have time.

686
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:14,730
Scott: I just want the fucking news.

687
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:16,754
