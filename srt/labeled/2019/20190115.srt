1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,666
Rym: It's Tuesday January 15th 2019.

2
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,188
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:15,198
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:22,113
Rym: tonight We are back to talk about the hot tabletop game root Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:25,466
Rym: So something very important happened.

6
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:31,945
Rym: I wad a bridge north of us was blown up The Tappan Zee bridge.

7
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,994
Rym: yep now there was nothing wrong with it's weird.

8
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:38,383
Rym: a lot of people kept saying like oh that bridge sucked like How?

9
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:42,760
Rym: what was bad about it other than the fact that it's way too far north because of nonsense politics.

10
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:45,540
Rym: So that bridge was old and falling apart.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,820
Rym: But that didn't a falling apart, but it being old and falling apart never actually affected one's experience driving over it.

12
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:55,233
Scott: There was mad traffic as didn't have enough lanes.

13
00:00:55,535 --> 00:01:01,540
Scott: the new one I don't think it has significantly more capacity is twice as much and it has a bike lane and a pedestrian path.

14
00:01:02,724 --> 00:01:04,388
Scott: But the old one was one bridge.

15
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:07,840
Scott: the new one is two bridges each larger than the previous bridge.

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,319
Rym: The thing is I am in no position to ever take advantage of that bike lane anytime soon.

17
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:13,588
Scott: Why not just bike up there?

18
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,359
Scott: It's a ways up as soon as it's warm.

19
00:01:15,723 --> 00:01:17,499
Rym: What's on the other side of it if you bike over it?

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,001
Scott: What do you mean?

21
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:20,952
Scott: on one side is Westchester and the other side is like Nyack?

22
00:01:21,113 --> 00:01:22,939
Scott: Yeah, it's like Nyack to Piermont.

23
00:01:23,222 --> 00:01:24,879
Rym: Yeah, I want to buy.

24
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:27,750
Scott: I've biked farther than that frequently.

25
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,220
Rym: I would rather bike over the Verrazano Narrows bridge.

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,525
Rym: That's the one I want a bike lane.

27
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:32,810
Scott: Oh that bike that bridge sucks.

28
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,312
Scott: It's tall.

29
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:34,356
Rym: I'm into it.

30
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:37,500
Scott: Yeah It's hard to bike over the Verrazano.

31
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:39,783
Scott: We've both done it.

32
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:40,306
Scott: It sucks.

33
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:40,969
Rym: Yep.

34
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:42,234
Scott: This bridge is not tall.

35
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:43,560
Rym: Yeah, there was a live stream.

36
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,264
Rym: It got blown up.

37
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:47,080
Rym: bridges blowing up is actually not that interesting to watch.

38
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:49,673
Scott: So originally they were like, let's blow up the whole damn thing.

39
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,040
Scott: then they're like, no, no, no, we'll hurt the fishes.

40
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:59,460
Scott: So they were taking it apart one piece at a time slowly And then there and then using the pieces to make reefs for the fishes down near Rockaway and other places.

41
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:07,562
Scott: But then they're like, oh no We were taking apart this one piece and we heard a really loud bet noise and we checked it and the structure might not be Too good.

42
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,774
Scott: So if we take it apart slowly, it might just collapse.

43
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:16,040
Scott: while we're taking it apart slowly So we're gonna have to blow up this one piece and then we can take it apart after it's fallen in the water.

44
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:20,220
Rym: But no to be fair that bridge was an old piece of shit in terms of engineering.

45
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:23,232
Rym: Maybe next they gotta work on the white stone in the frogs neck.

46
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:24,860
Rym: Yeah, right those things are held up.

47
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:25,924
Scott: They blow those up.

48
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:26,788
Scott: that'll be something to say.

49
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:29,440
Rym: those two are held up as far as I can tell entirely by paint.

50
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:39,500
Scott: I feel like what they should do for the white stone and frogs neck Right is they should make new bridges that go straight across Yeah, and then make two more bridges in it because they're so close to each other.

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,280
Rym: Oh, yeah, just make one two three and then get rid of the old two, right?

52
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,289
Scott: Well make two get rid of the old two then make two new ones in an X shape so you could start at one end right.

53
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:53,920
Scott: Make like an like a bow tie shape with four bridges with like loops at all the corners.

54
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:58,380
Scott: That way you can start on like the white stone and an end on the other side of the frogs neck or vice versa.

55
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,088
Scott: They're so close.

56
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:00,040
Scott: Yeah, but they're like.

57
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,539
Scott: They're like, you know They might as well be next to each other.

58
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,219
Rym: The only reason I ever used one or the other because one of them had more traffic than the other.

59
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,166
Rym: one Like it was pretty random which one I ever used.

60
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:12,400
Scott: I would choose based on where I'm going on the other side.

61
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,156
Scott: So if I'm going northeast, I'm gonna use a frogs neck is a little further out.

62
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:18,039
Scott: Yeah, right.

63
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:21,634
Scott: and If I'm going to like the baseball stadium, I'm using the white stone.

64
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:22,459
Scott: cuz it's right fucking there.

65
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,488
Rym: Yep I was usually going northwest.

66
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:25,795
Rym: So I ended up using the white stone.

67
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:29,230
Scott: Yeah, you know It's like where you're going is which one you're gonna use.

68
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,937
Rym: Yeah, that GeekNights' quality content.

69
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:31,480
Rym: You're looking for.

70
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:32,700
Rym: We're back talking about bridges.

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,404
Rym: We haven't done a show in a while because it was the holidays and we were all traveling and doing stuff and then it was Magfest.

72
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:38,787
Rym: Yep.

73
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:40,459
Rym: We had the New Year's party that we had to go to.

74
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:42,129
Scott: We're going to PAX South.

75
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:43,074
Scott: So you're not getting another show.

76
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:43,758
Scott: It's like next week.

77
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:44,641
Rym: Yep We can.

78
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:48,694
Rym: basically we can only fit in one show between all these cons and not too far.

79
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:52,105
Rym: after PAX South is paxis Kind of far out.

80
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:55,457
Scott: you're gonna be getting shows in February and March.

81
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:56,320
Scott: Yeah, it's far enough out.

82
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,400
Scott: We will be doing shows and the rest of January you're gonna get shows.

83
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,468
Scott: All right, Jen rest of January February and March.

84
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:02,190
Scott: They'll be nice.

85
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:04,680
Rym: So we are back from super mag fest.

86
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:05,789
Rym: So I think it's worthwhile to.

87
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,072
Rym: we don't.

88
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:12,060
Rym: in the old days We would do a whole show on every kind we went to but go to a lot of cons not a lot changes.

89
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:15,430
Rym: But there's always notable things to talk about for any big con we go to.

90
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,269
Rym: so mag fest 2019 was better than Previous mag fests in a lot of ways.

91
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,979
Rym: but mag fest has a problem that's starting to grow.

92
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:25,645
Scott: Man, this has always had a problem.

93
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:26,830
Rym: Yeah, but it's getting worse.

94
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:28,094
Scott: It's always been getting worse.

95
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:28,978
Rym: Yeah, it's getting worse.

96
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:29,640
Scott: worse, right?

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,180
Scott: Well, I mean that's the thing with getting worse is that every time it's worse than the last time.

98
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,103
Rym: So here's the deal.

99
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:38,577
Rym: mag fest is like the only non pax gaming con we like.

100
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:47,618
Rym: like Magfest is better than the worst pax in terms of the attendee experience But it's not quite on the level of like a pax West.

101
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,800
Rym: no But I really like mag fest and also mag fest is unique.

102
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:59,099
Rym: Some of the things that mag fest you make mag fest unique are really awesome Like the panel content at mag fest like especially if you want like academic.

103
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:07,251
Scott: Well, because mag fest is a nonprofit has to justify its nonprofit status So it does a lot of awesome things to justify its nonprofit status.

104
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:14,634
Rym: like mag fest panels are mostly fan panels Non gaming or like just fun stuff or they're like really like.

105
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:16,059
Scott: they're the kinds of panels that we do.

106
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,391
Rym: There's other people doing the kind of stuff.

107
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:21,223
Rym: We do at pax's at mag fest It's not just us.

108
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:22,649
Rym: so the panels are great.

109
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,399
Rym: Like I go to more panels at mag fest than I do at pax's.

110
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:30,053
Rym: But what they don't have are like big serious industry panels.

111
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:32,380
Scott: so much and a big serious industry presence at all.

112
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:40,840
Rym: Yeah, but it is it is all fan all the time Which is both a pro anacond because like there's better content in many regards.

113
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,580
Rym: But that content is often less polished a little more raw like pax will have a super polished panel.

114
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,885
Scott: The industry came to mag fest.

115
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:49,310
Scott: They'd be like we gotta shut this shit down.

116
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:50,595
Scott: Yeah, it's cannot have.

117
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:51,237
Scott: this cannot be.

118
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:54,993
Rym: yeah Like mag fest you'll go to a fire mag fest.

119
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:55,776
Rym: They'll go to a panel.

120
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:56,579
Rym: That's really good.

121
00:05:57,121 --> 00:06:03,260
Rym: But it's a little unpolished because the panelists are literally hungover or possibly still drunk from the night before.

122
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,684
Rym: But I love mag fest.

123
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:15,292
Rym: I love going to mag fest and generally like the arcade was rocking this year mag fest Traditionally had a problem where Thursday was pretty weak and Sunday was pretty weak.

124
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:18,100
Rym: this year Thursday was a full-on goddamn day.

125
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,955
Scott: Yeah, usually it's like I told people right show up to mag fest late Thursday.

126
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:22,557
Scott: Nothing happens.

127
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:25,708
Scott: early Thursday I got there and leave mag fest early Sunday.

128
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:28,618
Scott: Everyone checks out of the hotel and then the whole place is empty.

129
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,240
Scott: on Sunday There's no reason to hang around get home get home.

130
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,600
Rym: Yeah, I got there at noon and like tabletops already bumping like there's already panels going.

131
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,772
Scott: Yeah, so next year got to get to mag fest earlier on Thursday The expo Hall said it would open it too and it opened it too.

132
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,779
Scott: Yeah, it was bumping and last year mag.

133
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:50,157
Scott: Well, yeah last year at mag fest on Sunday morning tabletop was a hundred percent empty.

134
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:51,240
Scott: It was just a ghost town.

135
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,847
Scott: No one was there this year.

136
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:55,920
Scott: It wasn't bumping on Sunday, but it was there.

137
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,620
Scott: It was activity on Sunday and that was like the library was open.

138
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,465
Scott: There were people there.

139
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:01,009
Scott: would you could?

140
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:02,780
Scott: you could play games in there on Sunday?

141
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,740
Scott: There was also not feel like you were wasting your time or that you should have gone home like on Thursday.

142
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,479
Rym: Sorry on the last day on Sunday when I went in the the arcade was still bumping and like I still had to wait In line to play DDR.

143
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:17,479
Scott: You always have to wait in line to play DDR or initial D.

144
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,913
Rym: The time where you don't have to wait in line to play DDR or initial D is between 5 a.m.

145
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:23,137
Rym: And 10 a.m.

146
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,207
Rym: That is the magic moment.

147
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:27,693
Scott: All right, I'll try to wake up early.

148
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:31,087
Rym: as I've said I remember last year I was like, well 2 a.m.

149
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,131
Rym: It's too crowded.

150
00:07:32,392 --> 00:07:36,689
Rym: So if I wait till like 4 a.m There's no way anyone's playing DDR.

151
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:36,930
Rym: Nope.

152
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,155
Rym: There's still a line.

153
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:39,359
Rym: good God people.

154
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:47,230
Rym: But really the only problem with mag fest now like the fundamental problem The only thing that I have to say mag fest you got to do something about this.

155
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:53,535
Rym: Is that there are way Way too few staff for that crowd.

156
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:54,600
Scott: You can't get more staff.

157
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,160
Scott: It's not possible as long as it from mag fest remains mag fest.

158
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:05,170
Rym: Hey, well, I think they could but it's not my place to say because I am NOT staff at mag fest I don't officially represent mag fest.

159
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:06,720
Rym: I am just a guest to mag fest.

160
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:08,779
Rym: I show up to do panels and have a good time.

161
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:13,753
Rym: But the fundamental problem however mag fest solves it is a thing that packs has got.

162
00:08:14,174 --> 00:08:15,738
Scott: so saw it packs is not 24 hours.

163
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,732
Scott: It's not you guys has money.

164
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:23,977
Scott: It's not a non-profit But in order for mag fest to fix it It has to a stop being non-profit and B stop being 24 hours.

165
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:28,660
Rym: I do think there are other ways to solve it because it's not get a lot of money from a generous donor.

166
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:36,168
Rym: It's not just that they don't have enough staff because they have a lot more staff than people realize due to the nature of how they deploy their staff.

167
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:41,986
Rym: the staffer and the way the stat like their staff uniform and like the Staff are largely invisible.

168
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:44,560
Scott: They could make minor improvements in that regard.

169
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,091
Scott: But because it's 24/7 you need so many more staff.

170
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:51,148
Rym: But you need moves to those staff.

171
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:55,910
Scott: like the problem time seems to be right to do the job I think about like one enforcer at packs.

172
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,700
Scott: They do an eight hour shift each day, right?

173
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,049
Scott: Yeah, it's like okay at mag fest.

174
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,940
Scott: You need three people to do the same job.

175
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,908
Scott: Yep, because it's 24 hours packs in the back.

176
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:07,533
Rym: when packs went till 2 a.m.

177
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:11,725
Rym: We needed three full shifts Her day.

178
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:16,240
Scott: Yep, and that fast when it needs like five or six shifts to packs is three.

179
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:25,973
Rym: Yep, now they could get away with a lot less staff if they had the staff that they had were deployed a little more broadly and More importantly they have to be way more visible.

180
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:41,971
Rym: because a big part of why packs has so many fewer problems of harassment and nonsense going on is that Even if there aren't a ton of enforcers like in an area doing stuff There's always an enforcer within eyesight pretty much anywhere you go.

181
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:49,490
Scott: Like even if it's a little it's also less physically sprawling than All the packs is except for maybe West right.

182
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,559
Scott: but in West it's like any if you're in any of the official packs areas.

183
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,311
Scott: indoors There's enforcers about standing but there's.

184
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,080
Rym: but as part of this is even mag fest fault.

185
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:06,920
Rym: So for example mag fest did have a much better staff presence in the arcade Expo hall console free play like that area had a good as the main zone.

186
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:09,920
Rym: Yeah, it had a good staff presence and they'd handled things pretty well.

187
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:23,240
Rym: The problem is is one the general Convention Center area has if there are staff I literally never saw any and to Magfest is not responsible for having staff in the hotel lobby and bad shit was happening in that hotel lobby.

188
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,907
Scott: Well, the hotel lobby is just an you know an area that's connected to mag fest.

189
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,332
Scott: that has nothing to do with mag fest.

190
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:36,880
Rym: the hotel needs to be on top of that and Mag fest needs to bring the hotel accountable to deal with harassers and like though there are panels in the hotel part.

191
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,277
Rym: Oh, no I'm talking like the hotel lobby itself.

192
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,200
Rym: Magfest can't like the staff aren't gonna maintain order in that area.

193
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:48,618
Rym: The hotel seemed to be just turning a blind eye to it and there were harassing pieces of shit.

194
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:58,540
Rym: It was mostly like I want to say 16 to 20 year old white dudes who were just like didn't even have mag fest badges mostly and we're just harassing people.

195
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:01,460
Rym: And it didn't seem like anyone was on top of that.

196
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:15,131
Rym: But other than that mag fuzz was great and like every other area of mag fest Stepped up its game like the arcade started on time because most of the staff of mag fest are Curating and managing the content of mag fest.

197
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:19,489
Scott: It's like, you know, there's you go to a panel room and it's like yeah There's people they're running the panel room.

198
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:21,320
Scott: Yep, right you go to the arcade.

199
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,722
Scott: There's people.

200
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:24,015
Scott: they're fixing arcade machines to go to the tournaments as people.

201
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:24,840
Scott: They're running tournaments.

202
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,140
Scott: Yeah, you know go you go to a place in mag fest for this mag fest content and there are mag fest staff.

203
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:35,740
Scott: We're running that content there just aren't excess mag fest staff just walking around.

204
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,313
Scott: Yep, every mag fest staff member is like do it?

205
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,580
Scott: you go to the the museum.

206
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:42,108
Scott: There's mag fest staff in the museum running the museum.

207
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,774
Scott: There's no mag fest staff.

208
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:45,460
Scott: Just walking around the hallway being staff.

209
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:46,625
Scott: They don't have people for that.

210
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:48,976
Rym: Yep, and I think the shortest term solution would be mag.

211
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:53,707
Rym: This needs like ten people Per eight hours.

212
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:56,980
Rym: so spread that over 24/7 and make sure that you know feel like it breaks.

213
00:11:57,282 --> 00:12:07,248
Rym: They need a dedicated group of people whose sole job is to wear a very visible IMA mag fest staff person shirts and just Walk slowly around and be visible.

214
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:14,630
Rym: that alone would probably solve a huge percentage of mag fest remaining problems that are visible to the attendees.

215
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:21,503
Rym: and in terms of the invisible problems who cares like Stack on staff just hides all that stuff and it's fine Right.

216
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:27,409
Rym: I remember all the problems attendees never found out about back when I ran everything at Connecticut Mm-hmm, and that's that's right.

217
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:28,093
Rym: That's how to do it.

218
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:29,660
Rym: But mag this was a good time.

219
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,200
Rym: We will definitely be back for super mag fest.

220
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,845
Scott: Well, he's running mag fest.

221
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:38,480
Rym: as long as mag fest stands we will be there because I see how long it stands.

222
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,123
Scott: What's the over under?

223
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:40,289
Scott: I love this shit.

224
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,851
Rym: I think mag fest can survive the long run Mm-hmm.

225
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:50,060
Rym: I think it's the thing that the biggest danger to mag fest is probably beyond mag fest control and it's the same thing.

226
00:12:50,100 --> 00:13:00,040
Rym: That's a danger to all nerd stuff big mass shooting big Incident like the incident that happened at ALA that anime con that we're gonna talk about on our next Wednesday show the fire.

227
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:10,659
Rym: Yeah we're basically One of those shitty harassing dudes set a bunch of cars on fire in the con parking lot Because he was mad that a girl he was stalking wouldn't talk to him.

228
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:14,391
Rym: Essentially, yep shit like that is a big danger.

229
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:15,354
Rym: I'm really shocked.

230
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,440
Rym: incidents like that have not happened more often.

231
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:21,955
Rym: They do happen but big ones haven't happened as much as I expected.

232
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:28,655
Rym: it's gonna happen someday Mm-hmm, and I don't know what the con world as a whole is gonna do when it happens.

233
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:30,883
Rym: metal detectors are not the answer I point out.

234
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,940
Rym: this is one area where mag fest is objectively superior to packs.

235
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:39,161
Rym: mag fest does not have security theater or metal detectors and probably Neville never will Mm-hmm.

236
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:42,980
Rym: I really really am disappointed that packs has these bullshit metal detect.

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,760
Scott: Yeah, and you think it's like mag fest probably needs if it wasn't theater.

238
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:53,620
Scott: Yeah, if I could art you it's argue that mag fest needs it more than faxed us being half music festival half gaming con.

239
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:57,900
Rym: If any nerd thing needed metal detectors that were real, it's mag.

240
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:01,391
Rym: Yet mag fest is the one con that's doing it right.

241
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:04,400
Rym: if they're not gonna have they're not gonna have fake security.

242
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:09,460
Rym: They're gonna have no security or the right amount of security, but they're not gonna have fake security.

243
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:13,291
Rym: That's one area where packs I think has deeply failed us is the fake security.

244
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:23,100
Rym: Yeah, so there is so much game industry news centered Specifically around Activision Blizzard that we can't even talk about all of it.

245
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,692
Rym: There's too much and it's all evolving like a lot of it.

246
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:28,820
Rym: We don't even know all the details yet, right?

247
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,596
Scott: So the trigger I think is the Moreheim the CEO of Blizzard.

248
00:14:32,716 --> 00:14:33,519
Scott: This was a while ago.

249
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,184
Scott: There's a lot.

250
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:38,168
Scott: he announced he was leaving but now he's actually Really left like he gone.

251
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:42,726
Scott: Yep, and I think because of that it's like, alright now The whole boat is gonna get turned over.

252
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:46,379
Scott: you got CFOs getting like kicked out like one or two of them.

253
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:50,091
Rym: Yeah for and it's like one of them ended up at Netflix.

254
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:51,074
Rym: It's not really like.

255
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:53,080
Scott: it's not some kind of shenanigans going on.

256
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:57,119
Rym: So it's not yet clear Why these people left?

257
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,600
Rym: Specifically if they left because they were leaving or they were pushed out, right?

258
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:05,700
Scott: Some suggestions though.

259
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,478
Scott: No proof because it's you know, HR private info that like the one who went to Netflix was like kicked out for bad.

260
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,992
Scott: You know behavior and it's like Netflix.

261
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:19,770
Scott: You shouldn't be you know, people were like, hey Netflix Why are you hiring this person who had was badly behaving right?

262
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,456
Scott: There were some suggestions of that.

263
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:22,560
Scott: who knows if it's true?

264
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,228
Scott: Yeah, no idea.

265
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:27,984
Scott: Don't call me with your lawsuits of Slander or whatever.

266
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:32,720
Rym: Yep, but the Moreheim leaving was interesting partly because Moreheim.

267
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,463
Rym: Yeah, Moreheim.

268
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:34,527
Rym: I've never met him.

269
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,676
Rym: I don't know really a lot about him.

270
00:15:36,696 --> 00:15:37,580
Scott: He's the blizzard guy.

271
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,739
Scott: He's like the number one other guy, but basically the has been until now.

272
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,582
Scott: now He's not a blizzard guy.

273
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:46,295
Rym: all the statements about like his leaving are just super neutral generic.

274
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:48,542
Rym: Like he is leaving Period.

275
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:51,912
Scott: Yeah, really read what gaming sites have to say about it.

276
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:54,120
Scott: Now ESPN has to say maybe you'll get more info.

277
00:15:54,341 --> 00:16:03,433
Rym: Yep, according to the filing submitted this week on Monday He's leaving the company on April 7th Like he's actually leaving right because when he announced his departure he was then.

278
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:09,759
Rym: but then this is typical in many companies He stuck around as an advisor for various, you know ease the transition, etc.

279
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:14,932
Rym: There was no news release accompanying the filing which simply read.

280
00:16:14,952 --> 00:16:18,904
Rym: I'm gonna read the entire filing short as Previously disclosed.

281
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:28,560
Rym: on October 3rd 2018 Michael Moreham entered into an agreement with a blizzard Yeah, Moreheim pursuant to which he would provide strategic advice to the company in an advisory capacity.

282
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:33,901
Rym: Anyway, employment to the company will conclude on April 7th 2019.

283
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:34,745
Rym: Full stop, right?

284
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:35,106
Rym: That's it.

285
00:16:35,387 --> 00:16:38,137
Scott: And also so in somewhat related news.

286
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:43,560
Scott: There was this Unemployee of blizzard who's working in the Hearthstone eSports department, right?

287
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:59,860
Scott: wrote this big like story of how awful their job was and how you know It drove them to be have so much stress and be depressed and contemplate suicide And all this stuff and our HR didn't do anything and how blizzard presents itself as one of those companies that's doing it.

288
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,121
Scott: Right.

289
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:02,449
Scott: It's like yeah, we're inclusive.

290
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:02,971
Scott: Look at us.

291
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:08,670
Scott: We're not evil like those bad game companies But on the inside still is not near perfect.

292
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:09,252
Scott: Yeah, right.

293
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:11,839
Scott: So it's just an account by the employee.

294
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:15,719
Scott: You can go read it for yourself and gather from it what you will.

295
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:19,558
Scott: I read the whole thing because it was actually written somewhat compelling way.

296
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:23,019
Rym: Yep I'm linking to the variety article, but there's a lot of articles about writing.

297
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:26,400
Scott: Okay, so that's also in here in the blizzard shakeup, right?

298
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,179
Scott: Yeah, and on top of that you got the newest news, which is sort of a double news.

299
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:31,460
Scott: news.

300
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,506
Scott: Number one is that you know Activision Blizzard.

301
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:38,562
Scott: they brought Bungie in when after it got booted out of Microsoft or left Microsoft or whatever Happened there.

302
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:43,760
Scott: Yeah, right and they got the so and then they went through all the trouble of getting destiny and to battle net.

303
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,745
Scott: So it's like you're looking there.

304
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:49,482
Scott: It's like Warcraft Starcraft our stone Destiny Right.

305
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:50,044
Scott: It's like what's that?

306
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:50,947
Scott: What is?

307
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:52,132
Scott: one of these is not like the other.

308
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:53,075
Scott: right.

309
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,930
Scott: and now They kicking did the bungee out.

310
00:17:57,131 --> 00:17:58,620
Scott: It's like I went through all the trouble bringing it in.

311
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:01,047
Rym: What what's really happening?

312
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:04,096
Rym: Are they kicking bungee out or is bungee escaping Activision?

313
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:05,380
Scott: I don't know what's happening.

314
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:08,156
Scott: It seems like that, you know, there's so many shakeups going down there.

315
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:08,960
Scott: Who knows what the hell?

316
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,743
Rym: Yeah, I'm back.

317
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,873
Rym: We were talking about like bungee and what's their deal?

318
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:20,114
Scott: because as Scott said well You don't know bungee is the company that made marathon which was an FPS for the Mac.

319
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:26,412
Scott: all the people on Windows and DOS had Wolfenstein doom and quake right the Mac people had marathon.

320
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:27,756
Rym: I never played marathon.

321
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:33,690
Scott: marathon was Basically like slightly better than doom and nowhere near quake.

322
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:37,060
Rym: I literally never knew anyone who played marathon.

323
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:41,274
Scott: Anyone had a Mac had marathon because it wasn't on PC.

324
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:41,495
Rym: what?

325
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:44,886
Rym: and remember this is 1994. so who had a Mac in 94?

326
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:57,408
Scott: and then ironically the people who made the Mac FPS ended up going to Microsoft to make Halo the windows, you know xbox FPS Oddly enough before marathon there.

327
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,796
Rym: I didn't realize they made operation desert storm.

328
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:00,860
Scott: I never heard of it.

329
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:03,138
Scott: I mean I heard of the actual operation desert.

330
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:08,997
Rym: Yeah I thought it's not a game of the same name and a minotaur labyrinths of Crete and pathways into darkness.

331
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:11,948
Rym: 91 92 93 and then marathon 94. right marathon marathon.

332
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,476
Rym: So, I mean full disclosure.

333
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:22,411
Rym: I Never liked any game bungee made but I think they're good at like.

334
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:28,320
Rym: destiny and halo are very good at being What they are like if you like that kind of game.

335
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,064
Scott: I've also never.

336
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:41,260
Scott: I have also never been a fan of any bungee game other than marathon But I respect which I played because when I went to schools and summer camps They usually had max and they usually had lands and we could play a marathon in land mode.

337
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,850
Rym: See, I just remember when halo came out.

338
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:50,660
Rym: all I could think was wow That is really sad compared to every PC FPS that I already play.

339
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:52,006
Rym: Like what is this game?

340
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:55,260
Scott: and well people who only had consoles in the US mostly?

341
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:03,683
Scott: Yeah, who had played Goldeneye, which was worse than also When gold and I came out all I remember thinking was wow Goldeneye came out.

342
00:20:03,723 --> 00:20:05,229
Scott: We had quake one quake two.

343
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:09,663
Scott: We're like, wow, what's up with that Goldeneye, but and then when Marathon came.

344
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:11,571
Scott: Oh, no when halo came out.

345
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:13,239
Scott: It's like we got quake three and counter-strike.

346
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,899
Scott: Yep What's with this halo garbage?

347
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,860
Rym: But if you didn't have if you weren't a PC gamer cuz back then PC gaming was not like even today.

348
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,426
Rym: It's not that accessible though back then.

349
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:23,811
Rym: It was really not accessible.

350
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,638
Scott: So at least in the u.s.

351
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,106
Scott: Other countries They only had PC gaming.

352
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:29,520
Rym: but basically like I don't like these games.

353
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,340
Rym: But these games are very important to gaming and are very well made in the US.

354
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:35,445
Scott: Yeah, I don't think anyone.

355
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:38,559
Scott: I don't think Bungie even today has like audience outside the u.s.

356
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,744
Scott: It's it's right.

357
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:43,640
Rym: what I've gathered even in places any is mod is pretty popular outside of the u.s.

358
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,400
Scott: Yeah, cuz I mean even in places that do consoles like Japan, I don't think they're playing but he wasn't good.

359
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,044
Scott: Ah, I don't know what that is.

360
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:51,127
Rym: You don't remember Oni.

361
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:52,410
Scott: Let's show me a picture.

362
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:54,115
Rym: You probably remember Oni.

363
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:56,344
Scott: I Don't know.

364
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:57,194
Rym: It's gonna remember Oni.

365
00:20:57,295 --> 00:21:00,364
Scott: I don't know The box art.

366
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:01,750
Scott: I remember that wasn't.

367
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,296
Scott: it wasn't just a third-person action.

368
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:04,160
Scott: walk around hit things game.

369
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:05,370
Rym: Yeah, I never actually played it.

370
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:06,359
Scott: I don't know.

371
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:10,493
Rym: But yeah, so a lot of the gaming press like the.

372
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:11,758
Rym: the undercurrent is that?

373
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,340
Rym: Activision has the worst reputation of the Activision Blizzard Bungie.

374
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,093
Scott: Why can't we go back to the Activision that published pitfall for the Atari 2600?

375
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:19,655
Scott: That's my Activision.

376
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,265
Scott: Yeah, that's the good Activision.

377
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:24,713
Rym: It was all down from there ever raid.

378
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:27,502
Scott: That's good Activision right there To.

379
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,589
Scott: even then it was still good good Activision yet.

380
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:33,320
Rym: Shockingly River Raid holds up better than you would expect.

381
00:21:35,482 --> 00:21:39,634
Scott: But I mean Activision published mech warrior - right that was still good Activision in those days.

382
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:40,296
Scott: are 90s right mid 90s.

383
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,889
Scott: Yeah, these you know that activism went to poop.

384
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:49,147
Rym: So on top of all this Investors into Activision Blizzard.

385
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:49,869
Rym: full disclosure.

386
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,979
Rym: I own a. I own a decent amount of Activision Blizzard stock.

387
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:01,859
Rym: Investors are launching a possible fraud like there's a fraud investigation around the bungee split.

388
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:02,802
Scott: Why?

389
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:05,931
Scott: because they invested because bungee came in and how bungees leaving.

390
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:10,970
Rym: so there because I own some stock and I work in finance I don't want to comment on this at all.

391
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:12,480
Scott: Okay, so don't I'll comment.

392
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:18,587
Scott: So I guess they're accusing them of fraud to say I guess the argument would be I bought your stock Because you were getting.

393
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:24,440
Scott: you told me bungee was coming in Right, and now they're going out and now the stock price went down.

394
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,843
Scott: That's you.

395
00:22:25,863 --> 00:22:27,569
Scott: you lied to me, right?

396
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,014
Scott: I didn't get what I was paying for.

397
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:29,536
Scott: I'm mad.

398
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:30,680
Scott: And so I'm suing.

399
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:37,403
Rym: Yep, essentially and variety variety had all the good articles about this, but there's an article about this Specifically.

400
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:43,299
Scott: you can read and they get and then when they go to court They'll probably like you said this during the earnings call and it's not true.

401
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,130
Scott: That's probably the kind of stuff that they're gonna go for right?

402
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:48,600
Rym: Yeah, you know, there's all sorts of nonsense.

403
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:52,657
Scott: This is in your annual report, but look reality bungee gonna bye-bye.

404
00:22:52,817 --> 00:22:56,580
Scott: Yeah So it's about your stock based on false information.

405
00:22:57,283 --> 00:23:06,799
Rym: This is the kind of stuff that happens when false or misleading info a bunch of Separate game companies each of which is good at what they do end up being together in the same company.

406
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:18,420
Rym: and all of this is happening in parallel with the Massive rise of eSports where actually I think Blizzard is doing the most prudent thing.

407
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,568
Scott: Well, they're actually so for hearthstone.

408
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:26,219
Scott: They completely restructured the way hearthstone eSports works this year Yeah, and drastically and they haven't even announced all of it yet.

409
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,731
Scott: It's gonna be nothing like it was last year, right?

410
00:23:28,752 --> 00:23:30,520
Scott: Who knows what the hell's gonna happen with overwatch League?

411
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:33,200
Scott: Yeah, but oh also a side news.

412
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:37,079
Scott: Overwatch League did one thing a small thing but a big thing.

413
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:41,470
Scott: Small small in scope but large in effect.

414
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,215
Scott: now that no sports league.

415
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,658
Scott: I know of not even like NFL.

416
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:48,587
Rym: Oh, yeah Right, I had a Gomer Gator coming at me.

417
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:50,071
Scott: that is fantastic.

418
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:52,980
Scott: They made a single page that you can go to a web page.

419
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,710
Scott: That's just a web page a small thing.

420
00:23:55,113 --> 00:24:10,540
Scott: that web page lists every instance of Overwatch League players being suspended reprimanded Punished why they were punished what their penalty was in, you know, the whole history of everything all the players have done bad.

421
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,340
Scott: Can you show me like a page that's publicly accessible?

422
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,417
Scott: That's like every NFL player all the fines and suspensions they got all year forever, right?

423
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,645
Scott: No, there's no such thing right.

424
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:24,440
Scott: show me the list of like all the hockey players who got fined or suspended this year.

425
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,210
Scott: How much what it was for right?

426
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:27,438
Scott: No, it doesn't exist right?

427
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:27,820
Scott: not eat?

428
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,706
Scott: Not at least not available to the general public.

429
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:33,520
Scott: I'm like one easy-to-use page, but for Overwatch League, they got it.

430
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,845
Scott: Good job a plus.

431
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:40,429
Rym: so along those lines something really funny happened and I'll say This will be the last news.

432
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:42,039
Rym: then we'll get into route that you're all waiting for.

433
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:46,240
Rym: So we one of our magfest panels like we put the YouTube video out.

434
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:49,522
Rym: It's there and it was the top 40 games You should play.

435
00:24:49,743 --> 00:25:04,169
Rym: like the 40 games you should play and one of the ones we said was overwatch because it is the modern incarnation of like action quake 2 and weapons factory and TFC and like all those other games like it's the It's the iteration of that kind of game that is playable today.

436
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:04,671
Rym: Mm-hmm.

437
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:06,958
Rym: And this Gomer Gator came into my mentions.

438
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:09,838
Scott: hard Mm-hmm, and they're like just block them.

439
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:14,060
Rym: So because because they're because they followed the template and it was pretty funny.

440
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:23,590
Rym: but basically I discovered based on this Gomer Gator that a ton of Shitty people are really mad that they're.

441
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:28,597
Rym: they have been banned from overwatch because they were harassing people outside of overwatch.

442
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:39,445
Rym: Because blizzard in turn not in just an eSports thing But they will go after people like they're pro players who do shitty things Even outside of the game.

443
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:42,274
Scott: blizzard is doing a thing where you they're gonna.

444
00:25:42,655 --> 00:25:47,851
Scott: I think it's a. I'm not sure if it's a hundred Percent implemented yet, but the story I heard was to go.

445
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:53,009
Scott: it you'll be watching say some overwatch League on Twitch Yep, and you want to chat in the chat room.

446
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,760
Scott: You have to have in order to chat in the chat room.

447
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,688
Scott: They got like a plug-in that will prevent you from chatting in the chat room unless you have your battle net account Connected to your twitch account with Oh off.

448
00:26:02,848 --> 00:26:05,900
Scott: so if it means then you can chat in the chat room.

449
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:10,153
Scott: But if you say some racial slurs say for example, they can now.

450
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,440
Scott: they now have your battle net account.

451
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:13,968
Rym: They don't just ban you from the twitch chat.

452
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:14,129
Rym: Now.

453
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:16,220
Rym: They ban you from playing overwatch, right?

454
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,940
Scott: They could just ban you from battle net and all you lose all your blizzard games.

455
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:25,500
Scott: But won't people just like make a separate battle net free account because the accounts are free and use that for twitch chatting

456
00:26:26,063 --> 00:26:26,926
Rym: Another actual

457
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:33,251
Scott: account where they bought a thousand dollars of skins and Crates when they not use that one for twitch chatting,

458
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,657
Rym: so I'm not a hundred assuming

459
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:35,280
Scott: they're intelligent.

460
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:40,684
Scott: But as best I can tell, you know, they're probably not that smart if they're racial slurring but you get the idea.

461
00:26:40,744 --> 00:26:48,173
Rym: the best I can tell is that if you are banned and Blizzard identifies that you have another account and it's actually yours.

462
00:26:48,494 --> 00:26:50,160
Rym: They'll ban them all they have to find them though.

463
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:58,966
Scott: Yeah, if I if I made a separate account called like Rym Yeah, and I use the VPN to go on Twitch How would they ever know that?

464
00:26:59,006 --> 00:26:59,267
Scott: that's?

465
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:01,335
Scott: you know, what my real battle net account is.

466
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:08,640
Rym: Yep, but It appears to be working because a lot of gummer giddy shitheads are really really mad about this.

467
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,917
Scott: I mean you can get suspended from school if you're robbed liquor store.

468
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,058
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

469
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:21,285
Rym: so a GDQ 2019 just happened.

470
00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:25,260
Rym: It was a. it was an a-plus hype.

471
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:28,056
Rym: I Really enjoyed the first.

472
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:35,370
Scott: the only thing the only negative thing I can say about the most recent a GDQ No, was that I was less impressed with the prizes.

473
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:38,147
Scott: They're usually there's some prizes that I want.

474
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:43,610
Scott: the grant I usually pay like I usually donate the amount to qualify for the grand prize, even though I know there's no chance to win.

475
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,876
Scott: I'm donating what do I write?

476
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:47,510
Scott: but because the grand prize is still something like man.

477
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,778
Scott: It would be cool to have that yo, right this year.

478
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,910
Scott: The grand prize was kind of admittedly amazing.

479
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:57,282
Scott: It was like this replica Master Sword like to scale plus Hylian shield.

480
00:27:57,603 --> 00:28:07,898
Scott: that was like super legit like Wow And definitely was more valuable than the amount you had to donate to qualify which I think was 250 But I only donated a hundred.

481
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:08,381
Scott: cuz like.

482
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,747
Scott: I really don't need that master short.

483
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:11,336
Scott: if I got the master What was I gonna do with it?

484
00:28:11,538 --> 00:28:13,068
Scott: I'd probably eBay and donate the money.

485
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:14,352
Scott: It's like.

486
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:18,310
Scott: it's like what I'm gonna do with a fucking master sword not yourself with it, right?

487
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,552
Scott: It's like they didn't have you know in the past It would.

488
00:28:20,613 --> 00:28:22,584
Scott: I would always be like, ooh, I want that this time.

489
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:29,310
Rym: Yeah, but Scott Imagine a younger you where the want swords meter is still really high.

490
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:40,670
Scott: Thankfully young Scott did not have two hundred and fifty dollars to donate Only maybe like fifty dollars, but one of the AGQ 2019 speed runs stood out above and beyond me and Rym.

491
00:28:40,911 --> 00:28:42,417
Scott: So I've side haven't seen all the runs.

492
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:47,492
Scott: obviously there could be a better one, but me and Rym of the runs Unanimously agree.

493
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:59,250
Rym: Lord my best run of the week was my comment appears to be one of the top comments because basically Right after because I didn't watch this one live, but I caught it live and then I watched it again.

494
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,756
Rym: I caught the tail end of it live.

495
00:29:00,796 --> 00:29:02,102
Scott: show someone else how good it was.

496
00:29:02,162 --> 00:29:04,010
Rym: and as soon as they YouTube I watched it.

497
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,082
Rym: I've watched it two and a half times now.

498
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:08,453
Scott: Well, you watch it more than me Time more.

499
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:12,690
Rym: my comment on YouTube on this video will say literally everything needs to be said.

500
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:16,360
Rym: He is the most entertaining runner in AGDQ history, that's true.

501
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:19,610
Rym: quote there ain't no quiet time in this run.

502
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,296
Scott: That's right.

503
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:25,209
Scott: and quote god damn So big up shoutouts to grandpa and grandma.

504
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,142
Scott: Genesis, dr.

505
00:29:27,203 --> 00:29:34,985
Rym: Fatbody has injected a new level of hype and Just amazing commentary.

506
00:29:35,005 --> 00:29:35,589
Rym: He is.

507
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:40,310
Scott: It's not just that he is right cuz you I could go to GDQ and be hype.

508
00:29:41,032 --> 00:29:43,240
Scott: You know, I have that skill at least to some degree.

509
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,990
Scott: maybe not as much as the master fatbody but I could do that.

510
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:50,385
Scott: He had the hype and he was pulling off the sub pixel frame.

511
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:52,388
Scott: perfect tricks left and right Yep.

512
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,788
Rym: and meanwhile You know cuz a DDQ like there's a culture and the culture up to this point all the runs have a similar cadence.

513
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:03,030
Rym: like they're doing The thing the couch is talking and then the runner will be like, all right time for the quiet.

514
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:11,849
Scott: And the thing is when the run started he brings out this enormous couch full of people and I got this vibe of oh It's like one of those anime panels with too many people on it.

515
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:15,670
Scott: He's even got a guy on a webcam on a laptop on the couch.

516
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:21,225
Scott: He's busy on the virtual couch and I'm like, oh no, I'm like, I'm like, oh, oh.

517
00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:24,101
Scott: and then within five seconds I'm like, oh, yeah.

518
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:29,366
Rym: Oh, yeah He takes a slower strat at one point to hit something because I do this for my little.

519
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:36,874
Scott: he crashes the game Because it's funny because he just to show you that it's a thing even though it costs time and then goes back to the beginning Level select screen.

520
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:38,340
Rym: it was the best balance.

521
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,641
Rym: I cuz.

522
00:30:38,761 --> 00:30:45,124
Rym: I do enjoy runs that are like a Super technical like for our run where the the commenter is literally.

523
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:46,770
Rym: just let's explain this glitch.

524
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,758
Rym: Let's explain this sub pixel nonsense.

525
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:57,452
Rym: This run was the perfect balance of amazing display of skill coupled with amazingly entertaining Situation.

526
00:30:57,552 --> 00:31:00,223
Scott: I would say if you want someone to like introduce them to like.

527
00:31:00,263 --> 00:31:00,745
Scott: why do it?

528
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:02,030
Scott: why does everyone watch this GDQ?

529
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,918
Scott: Why do they raise two million dollars every year?

530
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:04,762
Scott: What's the deal with this?

531
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:06,269
Scott: This is your first run to go to?

532
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,555
Scott: Yeah, go for this run.

533
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:08,640
Scott: the second run out if you.

534
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:09,484
Scott: if not this one.

535
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:10,550
Scott: there was one.

536
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:13,070
Scott: I don't know if it was the last summer games done quick.

537
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,772
Scott: I think it was.

538
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,157
Scott: if not, it was the one before.

539
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:17,967
Scott: that was definitely last year where they did a strider run.

540
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:19,813
Rym: Oh Yes,

541
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:36,010
Scott: Strider and the guy doing it had never done it before but someone was sitting next to him teaching him how to do it And this dude he was a speedrunner but it never speedrun any a Strider in his life and They taught him the speedrun and then made him do it himself and it's like a five-minute run.

542
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:41,770
Scott: So it's not a big deal and that is like the perfect intro for anyone watching to the world of speedrunning.

543
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,463
Scott: Yeah, and like how do you learn a speedrun?

544
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:44,088
Scott: How do you do it?

545
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:56,050
Rym: Right like imagine if up until this point like you go to the PGA Tour and everyone gets quiet on the important putt and then Someone walks up and they're about to golf and they're just as good as everyone else like they're a contender and they turn around.

546
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,420
Rym: They're like everybody allowed before I make this putt.

547
00:31:58,601 --> 00:31:59,324
Scott: Yeah, everyone is good.

548
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:03,255
Rym: Hey gonna make the putt This speed you gotta watch this.

549
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:05,242
Scott: I think the rules of golf actually disallowed that.

550
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:11,346
Rym: yeah, you probably but dr Fatbody has elevated the bar of AGDQ commentary.

551
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:11,828
Rym: Mm-hmm.

552
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:13,439
Rym: So what do you got?

553
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,209
Rym: What's your thing of the day?

554
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:20,230
Scott: So, you know how y'all, you know go to museum right and they're like, oh such and such is restored, right?

555
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,064
Scott: They restore stuff at museums, right all kinds of old artworks.

556
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:24,210
Rym: Oh, that's your thing of the day.

557
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:25,450
Rym: I saw that tab open.

558
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:36,330
Rym: I didn't realize you sent it to me cuz I had it open myself already cuz I was saving it to be a day later, you know, you know Restoring, you know historic artworks, you know sculptures paintings, right?

559
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:40,365
Scott: But it's like you unless you do that or unless you're in the museum business.

560
00:32:40,546 --> 00:32:41,550
Scott: It's like wait a minute.

561
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:46,850
Scott: I actually had no idea how they restore a thing like right how what what do you actually do?

562
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:49,221
Scott: Right, like what is the physical process?

563
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:49,804
Scott: What happens?

564
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:50,869
Scott: Here's a guy.

565
00:32:51,695 --> 00:32:53,890
Scott: He works at Baumgartner restoration.

566
00:32:53,890 --> 00:33:01,682
Scott: I think it's like his company and his job is restoring artworks and There's a lot of videos on his channel showing him restoring mostly paintings.

567
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:05,323
Rym: and after I found the video you're linking to I watched Like ten of his videos.

568
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:05,970
Rym: They're really good.

569
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:15,586
Scott: But this one is a really good one because the painting is a painting on a piece of paper that is glued to a piece of wood and is ridiculously old and grody.

570
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:18,816
Scott: and he You're like, what are you gonna do?

571
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:22,170
Scott: like imagine me trying to restore this painting like what do I do clean it with?

572
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:25,762
Rym: He's like, I gotta I gotta move the wood.

573
00:33:25,902 --> 00:33:27,590
Scott: I gotta get the paper off the wood.

574
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,545
Scott: It's just like imagine I can't even get a sticker off something.

575
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:32,712
Scott: I bought an Amazon Right.

576
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:35,502
Scott: This guy's gonna get a piece of paper with a painting on it.

577
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:38,871
Scott: That's glued to an ancient piece of wood Right.

578
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:49,269
Scott: Anyway, so he's got this painting which is the assassination of Archimedes, which is an awesome frickin painting actually And he takes it from its grody state and restores it to a magnificent state.

579
00:33:49,289 --> 00:34:03,218
Scott: is It's a lot like watching those knife sharpening videos and you get that same feeling of like ah the cleaning and the restoring ah, but also a fascinating explanation of the process and what goes into it and A plus to this whole channel.

580
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:03,741
Rym: Yep.

581
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:05,552
Rym: One of the other ones I watched It's the.

582
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:10,594
Rym: I think it's the restoration of the Mother Mary, which is another one that's on wood But he doesn't.

583
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:12,181
Rym: he wants to leave it on the wood for reasons.

584
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:20,190
Rym: He talks about why but Anyway, he starts and he's like so I'm starting with the face and normally professionals do the face last because it's the most important part.

585
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:25,596
Rym: But this video will be more entertaining if I start with the face and also I'm really good at this So that's not gonna be a problem.

586
00:34:25,636 --> 00:34:29,330
Scott: Also he has to like touch up the paint and he's like, yeah We got this erasable paint.

587
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:30,175
Scott: It's like.

588
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:37,348
Scott: I'm like what he's like if someone in the future decides that you know I didn't do a good job because like he's like obviously not trying to paint over any of the.

589
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:37,909
Scott: the paint.

590
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:40,385
Rym: It's not like that famous Jesus that the lady messed up.

591
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:41,270
Rym: real bad, right?

592
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:52,190
Scott: And he's you know, he's just trying to fill in the blanks as closely to what the real artist did right, you know Taking instructions from the person who owns the thing who's paying for him his services, right?

593
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,234
Scott: So it seems like the bike.

594
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:53,614
Scott: he's like.

595
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:53,917
Scott: he's like.

596
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:55,382
Scott: I always use erasable paint that way.

597
00:34:55,402 --> 00:35:00,330
Scott: if someone buys this painting in the future And then doesn't like what I did they can erase it and do a different different thing.

598
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:04,563
Scott: So the theme without without erasing the paint from the original original.

599
00:35:04,663 --> 00:35:06,890
Rym: I want to try a new thing Grebel's style the.

600
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:12,240
Rym: So regardless of what our things that they are I think we can always come up with a theme based on what we both pick.

601
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:23,362
Rym: the theme this week was or this episode Masters displaying the height of their craft In the meta moment the book club book that we haven't gotten there.

602
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:24,527
Rym: cuz we've been busy as 2001 a Space Odyssey.

603
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:27,662
Scott: I said we would read it and I lied.

604
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:28,306
Scott: I was wrong.

605
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:29,050
Scott: We did not read it.

606
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,009
Scott: Haven't read up any pages of it since I said that I've been too busy.

607
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:32,873
Rym: Stay tuned.

608
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:34,158
Scott: way too much shit going down.

609
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:35,343
Rym: None of you read it either.

610
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:36,789
Rym: I know you didn't.

611
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:38,935
Scott: Someone has someone.

612
00:35:38,955 --> 00:35:41,103
Scott: the thing is I feel like people are either.

613
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:43,090
Scott: I don't feel like there's people like us listening.

614
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:49,517
Scott: I feel like the listeners who care about book club read it right away and listeners who don't care about book club Don't read.

615
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:50,809
Scott: I found a lot of their bed.

616
00:35:51,171 --> 00:35:53,785
Scott: The people I've talked a lot of people like us who read.

617
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,071
Scott: eventually people Don't.

618
00:35:55,493 --> 00:36:00,231
Rym: the people who really care about our book club don't tend to check what we're doing now and read it because they know our History.

619
00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:03,020
Rym: instead they'll go into the archive of the book club.

620
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:06,310
Rym: pick a book that look good read it and then listen to that episode.

621
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,836
Scott: That's good because at least you're reading.

622
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:10,285
Scott: as long as you read books you get an A+.

623
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:11,470
Scott: if you don't read you get an F-.

624
00:36:11,811 --> 00:36:13,217
Scott: There's not like a lot of in-between.

625
00:36:13,317 --> 00:36:16,149
Scott: even if you read eventually like we do you still get the A+.

626
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:18,275
Rym: So we were just at magfest.

627
00:36:18,315 --> 00:36:19,579
Rym: We did three panels there.

628
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:23,370
Rym: one of them, which is a brand new panel is already on YouTube.

629
00:36:23,471 --> 00:36:24,096
Rym: I'm gonna link to it.

630
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:25,467
Rym: You can just go watch it right now.

631
00:36:25,488 --> 00:36:30,787
Rym: Wow The other two panels will be on YouTube at some point in the near future.

632
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:31,370
Scott: That's good.

633
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,650
Scott: We're gonna record at least a panel at PAX South and put that online.

634
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,087
Rym: Yep, I don't think we're gonna record learn and win Carcassonne because we already did that.

635
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:39,770
Rym: We already did it.

636
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,294
Rym: We don't need another video of it.

637
00:36:41,354 --> 00:36:43,220
Scott: No, we'll just concentrate on teaching Carcassonne.

638
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,624
Rym: Yep, but that one's online.

639
00:36:44,644 --> 00:36:55,210
Scott: So also We were supposed to do this towards the end of last year and I told Rym about it months in advance But he still didn't make time even though I was on vacation all week.

640
00:36:55,711 --> 00:37:07,050
Scott: So after we got back from magfest no or just before yeah after he got back from magfest We recorded judging anime by its cover which somehow this show has lasted like over a year.

641
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,818
Scott: I guess we actually it's really fun to do.

642
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:11,630
Scott: we're keep doing it even though it's you know, whatever.

643
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:14,770
Scott: But yeah, we did it for the winter at season of anime.

644
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:20,210
Scott: There's already like two episodes out of most of the shows for the season of anime, but we haven't seen any of them.

645
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:28,469
Scott: So we still we're doing a pre affair pre judging and I guess that's kind of okay because once I upload it I've only got a little bit of work to do.

646
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,072
Scott: Hopefully I'll do it tonight and get uploaded tonight if I can if not tomorrow No.

647
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:45,342
Scott: and then Once that's up You will be able to see our pre judges of the anime coming out this season and there's some good stuff coming - they'll be like Two or two maybe even three episodes for you to just watch right away.

648
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,149
Scott: If you something we talked about sounds good.

649
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:51,182
Rym: And last and least well not least this weekend.

650
00:37:51,223 --> 00:37:59,781
Rym: The reason there's gonna be no show on Thursday We are gonna be at Pac South where we mention that already we are going to do two panels But specifically the new one.

651
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,350
Scott: So we're doing learn to win Carcassonne.

652
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,766
Rym: We talked about that and we're doing a new one nostalgia versus game design.

653
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:05,510
Scott: It's Rym's idea.

654
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,878
Scott: I'm not too hyped on it, but I get a free badge.

655
00:38:07,878 --> 00:38:11,030
Scott: 40 games was also Rym's idea and I wasn't too hyped on it.

656
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,893
Rym: I was hyped on it.

657
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:13,198
Scott: Yeah, you're hyped on anything.

658
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:14,985
Rym: I there have been panels.

659
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:16,290
Rym: I've not been hyped on anyway.

660
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:17,454
Scott: I really want to do.

661
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:20,706
Scott: my games are harmful panel, but no one in for PAX East.

662
00:38:20,806 --> 00:38:23,014
Scott: All right, let's do it But big stage.

663
00:38:23,195 --> 00:38:31,579
Rym: so at PAX South we will be doing two panels so they will be our fiftieth and 51st packs panels and it will both be on panels total.

664
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,066
Rym: my birthday job panels total.

665
00:38:34,588 --> 00:38:37,615
Rym: So I Have the list of all of them.

666
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:41,570
Scott: everyone, please bring edible birthday gifts for Rym that I should eat.

667
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,099
Scott: Yes that I will eat them.

668
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,689
Scott: Yes, and now Rym will not eat them.

669
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:50,410
Scott: Bring a cake a birthday cake that says Rym and has what 37.

670
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,564
Scott: I want to say number 37 on in 37 candles and then I will eat the cake.

671
00:38:54,845 --> 00:38:56,049
Rym: I feel like we have done.

672
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:59,796
Rym: I want to say 370 panels total.

673
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:03,370
Scott: ever so you can watch a GeekNights panel every day for a year and not run out.

674
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:08,190
Rym: It's terrifying because remember there were time there were old days where we go to an Otakon and do like a panels.

675
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:11,881
Rym: There's one ConnectiCon where we did like 20.

676
00:39:11,881 --> 00:39:14,096
Scott: So yeah Go and find us on the internet.

677
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:19,497
Scott: if you maybe discovered us at magfest or something or who knows or discovered us through YouTube I don't know.

678
00:39:19,698 --> 00:39:20,926
Scott: go go to Google.

Scott: We even got an Instagram which I keep saying I'm gonna start using it and I forget we even have a G+ even though That's going away imminently.

682
00:39:31,614 --> 00:39:32,578
Scott: We don't have that anymore.

683
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:46,199
Scott: We had a tumblr - I stopped updating the tumblr and the Facebook updates automatically, but even though you should probably delete your Facebook that's the only reason I don't delete my Facebook is so that page doesn't disappear and Even the Instagram is owned by Facebook.

684
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:48,690
Scott: I'm pretty sure we got Twitter's.

685
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,961
Scott: We're most active on Twitter and our forum.

686
00:39:50,982 --> 00:39:52,027
Scott: you should go to and sign up.

687
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:53,309
Scott: in our forum There are no Nazis.

688
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,673
Rym: I'm pretty sure the yeah There are.

689
00:39:54,955 --> 00:39:57,252
Rym: our forum is rocking and there are no Nazis.

00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:57,634
Rym: if you.

691
00:39:57,654 --> 00:39:58,135
Rym: that's far.

692
00:39:58,176 --> 00:39:58,617
Rym: if you try

693
00:39:58,637 --> 00:40:09,474
Scott: to apply to the forum and get rejected apply again and just make sure when you write Your reason for applying you write something that makes me know that you're a human who listens to GeekNights and not you know Robot from Russia,

694
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:14,170
Rym: yep, so and our tumblr is probably flagged as porn and gonna be deleted.

695
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,859
Scott: Anyway, I want to have it in my pixel.

696
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:16,341
Scott: meet tumblr.

697
00:40:16,763 --> 00:40:17,990
Rym: I'm pretty sure that's also poor.

698
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,181
Scott: All right, what people waiting for we're now?

699
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,830
Scott: we're gonna talk about route for the rest of the show.

700
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,597
Rym: Yep, Scott has finally played route.

701
00:40:23,778 --> 00:40:25,023
Scott: Well, I played it many times.

702
00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:26,630
Scott: I played it at least three or four times.

703
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:28,110
Rym: Yep, I've played it a bunch of times.

704
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,823
Scott: I can't remember was I've either been green twice.

705
00:40:31,044 --> 00:40:33,079
Scott: if I've played it four times I was green twice.

706
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:39,690
Scott: if I played it three times I was green then I was the raccoon and then I was the otters.

707
00:40:40,132 --> 00:40:43,310
Rym: I've been the woodland Alliance and I've been the birds multiple times.

708
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:48,525
Scott: I get the idea of how the birds work though I don't know the super details because I haven't been the birds.

709
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:49,530
Rym: the birds are so fun.

710
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:57,809
Scott: I only vaguely get the idea of how the cats work because I've seen I've played against the cats every time but I've never been the cats and I know nothing about the lizard folk.

711
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:01,270
Rym: I Didn't even read the rules about the lizard folk.

712
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:05,566
Scott: I know nothing about the lizard folk other than that.

713
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:06,490
Scott: There are lizard folks.

714
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,279
Scott: So here's the deal and that's supposedly they're not.

715
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,590
Rym: that good route is the new hotness.

716
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,824
Rym: It came out last year in 2018 and it like sold out immediately.

717
00:41:13,844 --> 00:41:14,687
Rym: It keeps getting reprinted.

718
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:17,344
Scott: It's unplugged It's sold out even sold out of the raccoon plushies.

719
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:25,102
Rym: Yep the vague the vagrant plushies vagabond route got Real real big and popular in a hurry.

720
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:27,310
Scott: It is popular big time.

721
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:33,811
Rym: Yeah, and that's interesting for a number of reasons because if I had to the before we talk about what root is Like.

722
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:40,158
Rym: you have to understand that the designer of root is Cole Worrell And if you don't know who that is from letter games.

723
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:54,728
Rym: all the other games that Cole Worrell is done are the ridiculous weird nonsense historical games that we play almost as Experiments like John company or an infamous traffic which Scott hasn't played.

724
00:41:54,768 --> 00:41:57,915
Rym: but you should Pax Pamir which I haven't.

725
00:41:58,055 --> 00:41:59,259
Scott: Oh, what are the Pax ones?

726
00:41:59,279 --> 00:42:01,125
Rym: Yeah, you played Pax Pamir.

727
00:42:01,165 --> 00:42:03,896
Scott: I think no, I've paid Pax Porphyriana.

728
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:04,865
Rym: Oh porphyriana.

729
00:42:05,168 --> 00:42:08,641
Rym: Yeah Anyway, those kinds of games old

730
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:16,790
Scott: crusty war games that you would only expect Someone with a long beard and a large belly and a broken chair to take off the shelf at the game store

731
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:17,674
Rym: but not the

732
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:24,115
Scott: ones that are on the shelf near the Napoleon's and the the Rommel's Right in the back.

733
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:25,160
Rym: They're not war games.

734
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:28,351
Rym: Like here's a bunch of chips that represent the Rommel's.

735
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:44,270
Rym: these are more like here is a detailed simulation of the opium trade in China and you play European shitbags who are trying to literally buy fancy hats to increase their social standing and the terrible cost to China.

736
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,614
Rym: Right and the opium trade.

737
00:42:45,794 --> 00:42:54,290
Scott: basically any game that this person made other than root is something you would never get on any table Of normal non crusty gore gamer.

738
00:42:54,752 --> 00:43:06,470
Scott: You know grog nard players our friend Chris will bring these to the table and I love these games But they are an acquired taste right mostly because as we've now learned the theme of them is crusty.

739
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,141
Scott: Root is just another one of those games.

740
00:43:10,302 --> 00:43:12,430
Scott: It isn't really mechanically different at all.

741
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:21,473
Scott: It's just that they put cute animal forest critters on it instead of putting crusty old war generals on it Or crusty old.

742
00:43:21,634 --> 00:43:23,097
Rym: literally there's no war involved.

743
00:43:23,177 --> 00:43:24,801
Rym: It's just training opium, right?

744
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:38,668
Rym: So this game root is a combination of a highly political Extremely asymmetric kind of war game where literally every player is playing with completely different rules.

745
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:40,133
Scott: There's.

746
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:43,150
Scott: there are a few rules you share in common with other players, right?

747
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,674
Scott: Which is that?

748
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:45,347
Scott: like you're just trying to get to 30 points?

749
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,390
Scott: It's like the default victory condition get to 30 points and win.

750
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:56,690
Scott: Yeah but you and the default rules are like if you Do something on the board like every piece of cardboard on the board you you hit gives you like a point.

751
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:58,350
Scott: Yeah, and that's like true for everyone.

752
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,430
Scott: But like everyone has similar like combat fighting rules because you can just fight your dudes.

753
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:10,250
Rym: But like one faction gets points by building things on the board another faction gets points by just selling things in their shop.

754
00:44:10,652 --> 00:44:12,562
Rym: Yep, another faction gets points.

755
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:13,246
Rym: They're just.

756
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:13,930
Rym: they're not a faction.

757
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:24,087
Scott: They're one dude Just one raccoon wandering around in the woods and they get points for helping other people or potentially just fucking Murdering people in the night or just getting items.

758
00:44:24,348 --> 00:44:26,999
Rym: Yep One of the factions is a lizard called.

759
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,642
Rym: I don't know what they do.

760
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:28,567
Rym: I've never read their rules.

761
00:44:28,587 --> 00:44:29,029
Scott: I don't know.

762
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:34,003
Rym: So it's it so like everyone's playing with these completely different rules.

763
00:44:34,024 --> 00:44:35,690
Scott: It's like you're playing your own game.

764
00:44:36,057 --> 00:44:42,298
Scott: Yeah, right You just happen to be on the same board and the only thing you share in common with the other players Is that board.

765
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:42,842
Scott: we're like.

766
00:44:42,882 --> 00:44:44,149
Scott: the rules are all the same.

767
00:44:44,872 --> 00:44:46,057
Scott: Right like that raccoon guy.

768
00:44:46,077 --> 00:44:47,041
Scott: It's like you're at your whole.

769
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:53,970
Scott: your whole game is controlling this one, dude But if you fight you're a dude, yep now the game's not super complex.

770
00:44:54,351 --> 00:44:57,884
Rym: Most of the people who say it's complex have just never actually played a complex game before.

771
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,410
Scott: I think it's complex for normal people.

772
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,990
Rym: It's complex for normal people a lot.

773
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:05,990
Scott: It is definitely above the heads of a lot of people but it is not above the heads of someone who was a nerd who?

774
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:11,644
Scott: Can listen to a GeekNights, but I've also realized having played it You can go to a gaming convention.

775
00:45:11,664 --> 00:45:12,650
Scott: it is not above your head.

776
00:45:12,852 --> 00:45:13,770
Rym: Well, here's the more important thing.

777
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:23,130
Rym: The reason so many people think it's so complex is that it is a very difficult game to teach Simply by the fact that it's so asymmetric.

778
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,997
Scott: Yes, you teach this game.

779
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:29,596
Scott: you have to teach like if you got three players, yeah It's like you teach three games.

780
00:45:29,616 --> 00:45:32,850
Scott: you to teach someone how to be the the the woodland alliance.

781
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:35,809
Scott: You gotta teach someone how to be the cats and someone had to be the birds.

782
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:51,190
Rym: So my advice to you if you want to play this game is to regardless of any other circumstance even if you don't like to read the goddamn rules yourself to understand how to play and Force the people you want to play with to read the rules themselves.

783
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:56,241
Scott: and the other thing is that once you've learned one or two of the the You know the.

784
00:45:56,262 --> 00:46:00,039
Scott: yeah Yeah, I was able when I played the otters.

785
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,224
Scott: I'd never played them before.

786
00:46:01,364 --> 00:46:02,890
Scott: I didn't get a new rules explanation.

787
00:46:03,312 --> 00:46:08,010
Scott: All I did was pick up the otter card, which is this the trading otters the river traders.

788
00:46:08,492 --> 00:46:09,375
Scott: They sell stuff right.

789
00:46:09,635 --> 00:46:11,020
Scott: and I just started reading the card.

790
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:24,437
Scott: I had already played the game two or three times as other Races and reading this card just reading it I 90% knew how to play the otters because I had played a few times before and I can read Right, and then I just had.

791
00:46:24,558 --> 00:46:35,210
Scott: I only needed an explanation of these details That I probably could have got if I had read every single word on the card instead of just reading You know the major important words in the card.

792
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:44,669
Rym: So we've got this like asymmetric political like kind of crazy game But it's skinned with the cutest animal art my favorite art in the whole game.

793
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:44,950
Rym: Okay?

794
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:45,492
Rym: I'm curious.

795
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:49,630
Rym: is the card with the bunny Bank bunny Bank the bun the better Borough Bank?

796
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:56,495
Scott: Yes, the bunny Bank as the cutest bunny inside the bank is the bunny that's in the bank is like hey money I think for me.

797
00:46:56,635 --> 00:46:57,377
Rym: It's the one.

798
00:46:57,518 --> 00:46:58,942
Scott: it's the given a second carrots.

799
00:46:59,103 --> 00:47:02,196
Rym: birdie bindle is really good already been on my bed But there's one.

800
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:03,789
Scott: not a lot of bad art at all.

801
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:06,043
Scott: But there's one card and the people's are way good.

802
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:07,230
Scott: all the meeples are way good, too.

803
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:11,710
Rym: It's the rabbit ambush card where the rabbit rise the rabbits rise up and kill all the troops.

804
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:18,488
Rym: Cuz it's just these really cute little rabbits like hey, but there were a little cloaks and they've just got this big fucking bomb.

805
00:47:18,788 --> 00:47:21,438
Rym: Yeah This game is so cute.

806
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,210
Scott: So alright, so that's another the race.

807
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:25,182
Rym: Let's talk about the real deal with the game.

808
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,630
Rym: Let's talk about like how it plays out, right?

809
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:38,065
Scott: So you got this map and the maps depending on which races you got in the game Right that you're gonna deploy you dudes onto the map Right, and then you're gonna take turns and on your turn based on who you are.

810
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,490
Scott: Your turn is completely different.

811
00:47:39,692 --> 00:47:41,228
Scott: Yeah, right what you do on your turn?

812
00:47:42,252 --> 00:47:49,412
Scott: Usually you have some sort of you know Actions you can take of various kinds and different ways of paying to take the actions You know.

813
00:47:49,452 --> 00:47:54,390
Scott: any actions usually involve moving dudes fighting, you know getting stuff there.

814
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:58,244
Scott: You have cards and the cards are multi-purpose cards have text on them.

815
00:47:58,264 --> 00:47:58,926
Scott: that does stuff.

816
00:47:59,207 --> 00:48:04,770
Scott: you can like build Cards, you can use cards to profess to pay costs of certain actions.

817
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:08,190
Rym: Oh, the screenshot has both birdie bindle and better bureau bank on it, right?

818
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:11,110
Scott: You can get some cards, you know by doing certain actions.

819
00:48:11,311 --> 00:48:16,630
Scott: Sometimes draw a card will be an action right and you got to pay for those actions using various resources.

820
00:48:16,731 --> 00:48:19,045
Scott: Sometimes cards are the resource used to pay for the action.

821
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:19,810
Scott: Yep, right.

822
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:24,670
Scott: So, of course, you know everything I said was super vague because every race is super different, right?

823
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:29,110
Rym: So the high level like we'll go through the races and kind of explain their high level deal, right?

824
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:33,066
Scott: So the first one you got to learn about is the red one the maquis de cat.

825
00:48:33,126 --> 00:48:37,863
Scott: the maquis de cat Which is like he's basically like the Empire right?

826
00:48:37,883 --> 00:48:39,890
Scott: He starts with cats all over the board.

827
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,979
Rym: Yeah, he's got his whole economy going on.

828
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,868
Scott: He's got this giant castle, right?

829
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:49,030
Scott: He's like deploying like all these wooden structures around and you know building stuff.

830
00:48:50,152 --> 00:48:52,108
Scott: I'm not sure how the cat wins cuz never been the cat.

831
00:48:52,692 --> 00:48:57,110
Rym: Okay, whenever I see that it's hard for the cat to win when everyone's skilled, right?

832
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,383
Scott: It's like whenever I've played I've only played against the cat and the cat's always been there.

833
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:04,000
Scott: and the feel I get from the cat Is they start spread out all over the board.

834
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,870
Rym: They start strong and slowly decline.

835
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:13,921
Scott: They slowly decline as basically everyone else is playing races that come on to the board Right, like all the birds start in one nest and spread out right.

836
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:24,214
Scott: the cat starts out like a blanket over the whole thing And then everyone rises up and pushes them back, but they're still pretty strong because they're all you know, they're the marquee They're like the Empire.

837
00:49:24,555 --> 00:49:25,157
Scott: so they still.

838
00:49:25,418 --> 00:49:33,930
Scott: they participate in a lot of combat a lot of making sure other people don't win Right while also building up resources and doing whatever their thing is.

839
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:38,725
Rym: So imagine like a big Empire that starts strong is beset by all sides.

840
00:49:38,826 --> 00:49:49,581
Rym: think like Rome almost And slowly collapsing, but they can win by consolidating their power Holding all these enemies at bay and making the red alliances to eventually.

841
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:55,023
Scott: they definitely need alliances because if everyone goes against them they got Nothing, I guess it's true of anything in a political game.

842
00:49:55,143 --> 00:49:55,425
Scott: demo.

843
00:49:55,445 --> 00:49:57,715
Rym: weasel in the chat points out That's the card we all forgot about.

844
00:49:58,077 --> 00:50:00,687
Rym: mouse in a sack might be the cutest card.

845
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:01,350
Scott: That is a good one.

846
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,007
Scott: I forgot all about that car is a good one.

847
00:50:03,591 --> 00:50:07,241
Rym: So the birds are sort of like the antagonist like imagine.

848
00:50:07,282 --> 00:50:10,792
Rym: the story is the cats are the Empire and there is Decline.

849
00:50:10,812 --> 00:50:13,161
Scott: the birds are like the elf and for the elves.

850
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:15,168
Rym: right there the ancient proud race.

851
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:18,450
Scott: right there They're hidden away, and there's one spot in love laureate.

852
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,803
Scott: And then they got out of the world they got angered and they then they bust out.

853
00:50:22,024 --> 00:50:27,182
Rym: yeah imagine like they're the old Empire That's trying to come back out of the scene now that the cat Romans are in decline.

854
00:50:27,222 --> 00:50:27,463
Rym: right.

855
00:50:27,564 --> 00:50:31,981
Rym: so their deal is they start in One spot and they expand and expand.

856
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:34,150
Scott: they have a shit ton of birds in that one spot.

857
00:50:34,552 --> 00:50:38,050
Rym: So you've got this bird Empire and this cat Empire.

858
00:50:38,191 --> 00:50:39,415
Rym: They're at war and that is the.

859
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:42,166
Rym: the primary crux of the game is the war between these two.

860
00:50:42,186 --> 00:50:42,688
Scott: you don't have to.

861
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:47,880
Scott: you could play Without either of these two things, but in most all the games I've played both of them that you look.

862
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,469
Rym: in the rulebook depending on the number of players There's a list of the options that work.

863
00:50:51,871 --> 00:50:57,130
Rym: Yeah, like mean you could this many players have the birds the cats and any of these other factions.

864
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,164
Scott: It's best if you obey those right.

865
00:50:59,446 --> 00:51:00,030
Rym: it doesn't really.

866
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,301
Scott: Vagabonds is not gonna be too great.

867
00:51:02,482 --> 00:51:08,290
Rym: depend if you have a lot of players You could have two different vagabonds two different raccoons that are independently wandering around stabbing people.

868
00:51:08,431 --> 00:51:15,808
Scott: Yeah, but like if you only have two raccoons and a trading company That's gonna be a weird weird game, so the crux of the game is in the woodland.

869
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:18,858
Rym: in the woods There's this big war going on between the birds and the cats.

870
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:22,370
Rym: the third main faction is the woodland alliance.

871
00:51:22,691 --> 00:51:24,358
Scott: These are basically the cute mice.

872
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:26,566
Rym: These are the forest communists right.

873
00:51:26,807 --> 00:51:29,540
Scott: so what they do is They start not on the board at all really.

874
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,430
Rym: They're just the normal woodland citizens.

875
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:31,891
Rym: They're the.

876
00:51:32,192 --> 00:51:38,090
Rym: they're the bunnies and the foxes but all the other people living in the woods and they get points by placing.

877
00:51:38,531 --> 00:51:42,342
Scott: Basically when other people do stuff right they get these cards.

878
00:51:42,483 --> 00:51:46,996
Scott: other people's cards end up in the mouse Stack on the mouse card.

879
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:56,050
Scott: the mouse the mouse playing mat right like your other people's cards And they use them will end up over there because they got to pay the mice and then the mice will put.

880
00:51:56,551 --> 00:52:04,775
Scott: Use those cards to perform actions, and they'll put their little fists in different cities on the board like the little little you know in Insurrection fists.

881
00:52:04,815 --> 00:52:06,742
Scott: so the might think of what are they actually called?

882
00:52:06,762 --> 00:52:08,710
Scott: I forget the actual name for the woodland alliance.

883
00:52:08,852 --> 00:52:12,413
Scott: No that name for the fist of the sympathy Wars going.

884
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:14,619
Scott: that city is now sympathetic to the rebellion.

885
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:15,722
Rym: the war is going on.

886
00:52:16,043 --> 00:52:24,466
Rym: the more warring nonsense is happening between the birds And the cats the more sympathy the woodland alliance the rebels who are trying to kick everybody out right.

887
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:26,374
Scott: so the main action That you know.

888
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:32,609
Scott: they put these fist tokens out on the board and they get a lot of points And then they put little like you know a little bases out and they get a lot of points for that too.

889
00:52:33,031 --> 00:52:34,918
Scott: And so they can win just like putting these tokens out.

890
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:38,010
Scott: so everyone else has to constantly quell the rebellion.

891
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:39,483
Scott: So and if you don't they will win.

892
00:52:39,684 --> 00:52:42,499
Rym: so though so This is how the game gets political.

893
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:53,214
Rym: the cats and the birds are at war with each other But they will both sort of tacitly agree to maintain martial law in like the non disputed Territories.

894
00:52:53,456 --> 00:52:55,568
Rym: so the woodland alliance can't get a foothold right.

895
00:52:55,729 --> 00:52:57,450
Rym: so I got a war with Scott.

896
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:02,485
Rym: But we both have to while we're warring with each other keep the communists down right.

897
00:53:02,525 --> 00:53:04,290
Scott: and what happens is it's like okay?

898
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,169
Scott: I got a fist here and a little base here.

899
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:10,026
Scott: I'm playing green, but there's a whole bunch of troops here from the birds.

900
00:53:10,347 --> 00:53:11,433
Scott: well, okay I can't.

901
00:53:11,474 --> 00:53:11,796
Scott: they're gonna.

902
00:53:12,038 --> 00:53:16,830
Scott: not only can I not do much about it But they can totally destroy my stuff and get points and jump right.

903
00:53:17,212 --> 00:53:21,982
Scott: But let's say I get my fist up and there's not a lot of guys There is not too strong.

904
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:25,865
Scott: now I can basically rise up in that place and kick ass.

905
00:53:25,946 --> 00:53:29,586
Scott: so suddenly suddenly There's a bunch of mice on the board in that spot because they revolted.

906
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:33,541
Rym: the last game I played I was the birds and Chris was the cats and I was like.

907
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:35,328
Rym: suddenly the woodland alliance busted out.

908
00:53:35,368 --> 00:53:40,430
Scott: real bad Yeah, so we you cannot let that happen too often otherwise They're just gonna.

909
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:47,359
Rym: So we basically had a truce to go fuck up the wood commune the woodland communists Before they presented a threat to all of us.

910
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,725
Rym: so we had to pause our war.

911
00:53:48,966 --> 00:53:49,970
Rym: yeah for the greater good.

912
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:51,677
Scott: So then you got the vagabond.

913
00:53:51,697 --> 00:53:56,638
Rym: so the vagabond is we've got three big warring factions And the vagabond is just one raccoon.

914
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:59,870
Scott: literally you get one token that you move around the map individually.

915
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,394
Scott: You're just a cute record or you're like an adventurer But actually you're not.

916
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:06,789
Scott: you can choose a sort of a subclass when the game starts.

917
00:54:07,231 --> 00:54:08,395
Scott: Tinkerer is op.

918
00:54:08,435 --> 00:54:09,779
Scott: not even gonna lie it just is.

919
00:54:10,181 --> 00:54:11,485
Scott: I didn't even know it was op.

920
00:54:11,846 --> 00:54:14,716
Scott: and then I looked through all that I was The one time I played vagabond.

921
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:21,930
Scott: I was looking through all the different choices, and I was like I Kind of want to be this one for theme, but tinkerer seems strong to me.

922
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,285
Scott: And then I googled it like which one is best.

923
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:27,105
Scott: and it was like tinker Oh my god, and I was like oh, I guess I was right.

924
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:27,730
Scott: Let me be tinker.

925
00:54:28,911 --> 00:54:30,776
Scott: So the tinker is about making stuff right.

926
00:54:31,157 --> 00:54:35,450
Scott: so the way that the vagabond works is you have all these items right now other?

927
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:39,324
Scott: People can craft items in in the game for various purposes.

928
00:54:39,364 --> 00:54:40,950
Scott: they get victory points for crafting items.

929
00:54:41,493 --> 00:54:48,166
Scott: But if you get a vagabond in the game suddenly the items do stuff Every all the items the vagabond has let them perform actions.

930
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:52,630
Scott: the more items They have the more actions they can perform right and do stuff.

931
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:53,414
Scott: They got hammers.

932
00:54:53,656 --> 00:54:55,587
Scott: they can craft things and make their own items.

933
00:54:55,647 --> 00:55:01,930
Scott: if they got Swords they can stab people and do attack actions if they got you know the boot they can move around better, right?

934
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:03,057
Scott: It's all the you know.

935
00:55:03,077 --> 00:55:06,096
Scott: they start with a few items But there's more that they get.

936
00:55:06,176 --> 00:55:10,878
Scott: some of them they get by going around and questing and some of them they get by trading with other players.

937
00:55:11,506 --> 00:55:17,070
Scott: also The main way the vagabond gets victory points is not just by building and getting these items.

938
00:55:17,592 --> 00:55:21,750
Scott: It's actually just by helping other people and other people can't refuse your help.

939
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:23,380
Scott: You just help them if you want to.

940
00:55:23,722 --> 00:55:24,346
Scott: right you can.

941
00:55:24,386 --> 00:55:27,228
Scott: you can deal with them I guess, but I just went around helping people.

942
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:29,820
Scott: yep And when you help people you get mad victory points.

943
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,563
Scott: so that you got this.

944
00:55:30,623 --> 00:55:36,843
Scott: you're in it like a sole adventurer Whether you're a tinker or and you know a fighter or whatever you are.

945
00:55:37,184 --> 00:55:38,567
Scott: you just one little raccoon token.

946
00:55:38,587 --> 00:55:43,604
Scott: you go around the board And you know you do stuff to help people and you get points for that.

947
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:48,145
Scott: and if you can do more helping Before anyone else can win then you can win.

948
00:55:48,306 --> 00:55:48,950
Rym: so think about this.

949
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:53,970
Rym: You're just this one little raccoon wandering around in the midst of this giant cataclysmic war.

950
00:55:54,435 --> 00:56:01,669
Rym: You're just trying to make your way And you're trying to help everybody enough to where no one quite wins the war and then eventually you come out on top yep.

951
00:56:02,553 --> 00:56:06,950
Scott: So then we got this the otters, so I played the otters most recently.

952
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:10,110
Scott: I came super close to winning.

953
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:13,403
Scott: I could have won if I would add just like a couple more victory points here.

954
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,856
Scott: there couldn't quite pull it off if I would Have micromanaged and fought a little harder.

955
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:18,903
Scott: I could have gotten two points somewhere right.

956
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,090
Scott: I could have built a card or something right yeah.

957
00:56:21,231 --> 00:56:24,739
Rym: But at the same time if you'd been doing better I was gonna just pause my war.

958
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:26,910
Scott: you had no idea that I had that many points in the pocket.

959
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:27,352
Scott: Yeah, I did.

960
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:27,875
Scott: I put out.

961
00:56:27,935 --> 00:56:34,890
Scott: I pulled out like what like eight points in the last turn like BAM Yeah, but I could have destroyed basically all of your things.

962
00:56:35,371 --> 00:56:37,138
Scott: Yeah, but if I was you would you.

963
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,765
Scott: I was ten points away from winning.

964
00:56:38,805 --> 00:56:40,989
Scott: if I was eight away from winning you would have destroyed all my things.

965
00:56:41,892 --> 00:56:43,018
Scott: Come on anyway.

966
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:44,205
Scott: The otters are traders.

967
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,122
Scott: There's a river on the board and you can't really.

968
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:53,884
Scott: the river doesn't really mean anything unless the otter Means a little bit, but if the otters are in the game the river means a lot.

969
00:56:53,945 --> 00:56:55,310
Scott: the otters live along the river.

970
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:57,670
Scott: They can help people travel on the river.

971
00:56:57,811 --> 00:56:59,056
Scott: They can travel on the river.

972
00:56:59,137 --> 00:57:00,021
Scott: kind of right.

973
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:03,755
Rym: basically the otters put up their prices like hey It'll cost you X to use.

974
00:57:03,815 --> 00:57:06,343
Scott: the otters have various services that they sell.

975
00:57:06,403 --> 00:57:08,850
Scott: the services that they sell are like river traveling.

976
00:57:09,472 --> 00:57:15,170
Scott: They sell the cards in their hand face outwards on a little thing and they set those cards are for sale.

977
00:57:15,471 --> 00:57:16,777
Scott: You can't deny some.

978
00:57:16,797 --> 00:57:18,484
Scott: you set a price every turn.

979
00:57:18,504 --> 00:57:19,950
Scott: you set your prices for your services.

980
00:57:20,392 --> 00:57:23,990
Scott: But if someone wants to buy one of your cards, you can't say no they buy them, right?

981
00:57:25,212 --> 00:57:27,202
Scott: And what's the other service you have that you sell?

982
00:57:27,222 --> 00:57:29,636
Scott: I think oh, it's fight It's we fight with you.

983
00:57:29,676 --> 00:57:31,890
Scott: You can hire us as mercenaries and we'll fight with you.

984
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:37,677
Rym: So if the otters have some people on the board and I need like say they're on a place and there's some cats there and on The birds I got to deal with the cats.

985
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,109
Rym: I could just pay the otters and now the I'm the otters.

986
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:50,184
Scott: I just leave some otters standing around in a city that I know is gonna have some warring and Someone else comes along and my services cost whatever.

987
00:57:50,224 --> 00:57:51,410
Scott: I set the price at that turn.

988
00:57:51,812 --> 00:57:52,716
Scott: Someone pays the price.

989
00:57:52,897 --> 00:57:55,569
Scott: suddenly the otters get their Spears and join the fight, right?

990
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:59,078
Scott: So the thing is about the otters.

991
00:57:59,098 --> 00:58:02,890
Scott: is that when you pay the otters you pay them with your own dudes.

992
00:58:03,572 --> 00:58:09,135
Scott: You you don't pay them with like money or cards your dudes that are not on the board right now Just like your wooden meeples.

993
00:58:09,536 --> 00:58:11,846
Scott: you give them to the otter player, right?

994
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,296
Scott: So it's like, okay I want to buy a card from you.

995
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:14,778
Scott: Mr.

996
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:15,179
Scott: Otter.

997
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:18,452
Scott: All right, give me three of your dudes that aren't on the board Okay.

998
00:58:18,593 --> 00:58:20,604
Scott: Well, first of all, your dude supply starts running low.

999
00:58:20,644 --> 00:58:21,730
Scott: if you do this, right?

1000
00:58:22,053 --> 00:58:23,490
Scott: You only have a limited number of dudes.

1001
00:58:23,611 --> 00:58:33,430
Rym: So for example in our last game The cats got kind of desperate and they gave you basically all their dudes to pull off a big play Which means even if they want to put a bunch of dudes on the board?

1002
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,369
Scott: Well, I'm holding on to those dudes too bad.

1003
00:58:35,952 --> 00:58:44,301
Scott: And then when you're the otters and you want to perform actions you spend the dudes that you've got Not only the dudes other people gave you but also your own dudes.

1004
00:58:44,341 --> 00:58:55,650
Scott: if no one gave you any dudes you basically get two of Your own dudes into your into your purse for spending Right, and then it's sort of like buying nothing from yourself for two dudes automatically, right?

1005
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,484
Scott: So you're gonna be able to do stuff and you spend these dudes in various actions.

1006
00:58:59,725 --> 00:59:11,790
Scott: some actions that you might perform just sort of put the dudes into a holding pen and then they go back to the purse next turn and Sometimes when for certain actions you actually have to give the dudes back to the player they came from in order to spend the dudes.

1007
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:20,110
Rym: so basically imagine like I don't know Corsica or Venice you know, there's a big war going on and you're outside like not in the forest.

1008
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:34,090
Rym: You're like, hey There's a war going on and you slide in along the river and start selling weapons to everybody and then eventually Everybody fighting the war owes you so much money that you are in fact control of the content in control of the country.

1009
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:39,230
Scott: The primary way you score victory points when you're the otters is you know the same way everyone else's scores victory points.

1010
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:45,190
Scott: but the number one way is Building trading posts which give you mad points when you put them out on the board.

1011
00:59:45,712 --> 00:59:50,630
Scott: So I basically and building a trading post cost you other people's dudes, right?

1012
00:59:51,191 --> 00:59:54,050
Scott: You just like every all your other actions building a trading post cause dudes.

1013
00:59:54,572 --> 01:00:01,330
Scott: So I basically had a bunch of dudes and it was getting close to the end of the game And I put out like three or four trading posts all at once.

1014
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,780
Scott: I got a pile of points and was too short of winning.

1015
01:00:04,182 --> 01:00:07,515
Scott: if I just gotten two points earlier in the game Boom, I would have had it.

1016
01:00:07,555 --> 01:00:13,419
Rym: but you only had that capability because the cats who were desperate Spent a ton of money with you.

1017
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:19,125
Scott: Well, they right they would have had to either right it They would have still done that if I had two more victory points, right?

1018
01:00:19,145 --> 01:00:20,491
Scott: I Don't know.

1019
01:00:20,772 --> 01:00:21,355
Scott: Yeah, maybe they.

1020
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:24,290
Scott: maybe you would have looked carefully, but that's the thing the game.

1021
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:26,850
Scott: But also if I looked carefully I would have had two more points by then.

1022
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:42,387
Rym: So basically what this comes down to is it's a pretty abs like well abstracted asymmetric kind of realistic war gamey game With cute animals and the theme works really well and the game is just really fun to play.

1023
01:00:42,407 --> 01:00:43,751
Rym: It doesn't even take that long Mm-hmm.

1024
01:00:44,152 --> 01:00:49,190
Scott: Yeah, it's like people were so hype about root when it first came out and I was like my mood on.

1025
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:52,976
Scott: It was like I like the cute animals You know, but I'm not unlike.

1026
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:54,283
Scott: why is everyone so excited?

1027
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:55,388
Scott: How great can it be?

1028
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:00,610
Rym: And I saw other people who weren't our friends playing it and their games were taking like four hours, right?

1029
01:01:00,852 --> 01:01:01,400
Scott: You know, I was like.

1030
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,070
Scott: I was like, all right.

1031
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:05,869
Scott: I got to see what the deal is obviously right and then I played it once and I was like, all right.

1032
01:01:07,255 --> 01:01:09,190
Scott: And then I played it again and I was like, all right.

1033
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:15,315
Scott: The second playthrough is when you see the fun of this game and then the third time I'm like, you know I think you know you.

1034
01:01:15,536 --> 01:01:23,450
Scott: the first few games of it that I played it was sort of like, all right I'll play root the the time I played most recently with the otters.

1035
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:27,065
Scott: Yeah That was the first time where I was like bust out the root Scott.

1036
01:01:27,106 --> 01:01:29,155
Rym: wait till you try the birds Next time we play.

1037
01:01:29,195 --> 01:01:30,380
Scott: I don't really want to be the birds.

1038
01:01:30,762 --> 01:01:32,470
Scott: They have that whole failing thing.

1039
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:37,270
Rym: So here's an example of like a detail because I played the birds twice and I really like the birds.

1040
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:37,814
Rym: They're fun.

1041
01:01:38,197 --> 01:01:43,304
Rym: Their deal is that they're a Free so you choose a leader depending and there's two.

1042
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,850
Rym: there's four things you can do on your turn.

1043
01:01:45,253 --> 01:01:46,929
Rym: You can recruit like make more birdies.

1044
01:01:47,472 --> 01:01:57,130
Rym: you can move your birdies around you can fight people with the birdies and you can build stuff and Depending on the leader you pick you have a wild card in two of those spots.

1045
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:00,570
Rym: So say I have I start with a wild card and recruit in battle.

1046
01:02:01,472 --> 01:02:02,259
Rym: Every turn.

1047
01:02:02,279 --> 01:02:07,450
Rym: you must do Everything in the decree or your government collapses, right?

1048
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:09,277
Scott: So in the first turn I recruit and I battle.

1049
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:12,170
Rym: the next turn I have to add another card to the decree.

1050
01:02:12,351 --> 01:02:15,310
Scott: So now every single turn your decree keeps getting bigger.

1051
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:19,350
Scott: So you have to do everything you did last turn and more every turn.

1052
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:21,150
Scott: So now I have to recruit move in battle.

1053
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:28,818
Scott: No next turn after recruit move battle battle and I have to recruit recruit move battle battle and even better a decision You can make at the start of your turn.

1054
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:30,789
Rym: you must add one card to the decree.

1055
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:34,299
Scott: Yeah, you may add two right now.

1056
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,964
Scott: This is basically each turn.

1057
01:02:36,004 --> 01:02:38,210
Scott: It's like wow, I get more actions every single turn.

1058
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:42,184
Scott: It's like you just keep getting stronger and stronger and stronger, but then that's true.

1059
01:02:42,244 --> 01:02:43,950
Rym: Oh, no, there's no one to fight.

1060
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,435
Scott: It's like I have to do.

1061
01:02:46,836 --> 01:02:47,839
Scott: I recruit recruit.

1062
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,410
Scott: Oh, I don't have enough guys to recruit recruit recruit recruit move.

1063
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:53,018
Scott: I don't have any legal moves.

1064
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:55,690
Scott: recruit recruit move battle battle.

1065
01:02:56,212 --> 01:03:00,210
Scott: There's no dudes in a spot that can battle because I didn't have enough move.

1066
01:03:00,356 --> 01:03:04,574
Scott: Yeah And as soon as you can't do all of the actions You fail.

1067
01:03:04,594 --> 01:03:05,799
Scott: your government just collapses.

1068
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:06,682
Rym: you lose a bunch of points.

1069
01:03:06,722 --> 01:03:08,730
Rym: You got to pick a new leader and fun stuff happens.

1070
01:03:08,854 --> 01:03:14,470
Scott: Yeah So usually people fail a couple of times every game except for the game.

1071
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:16,418
Rym: I just talked about where I never failed.

1072
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:23,520
Scott: my family somehow managed to play the whole game and Never failed at the decree and therefore won.

1073
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:27,032
Scott: I think I think if you're the birds and you never fail the decree You're gonna win.

1074
01:03:27,233 --> 01:03:29,042
Rym: Yeah, that is real hard to pull off.

1075
01:03:29,143 --> 01:03:30,550
Scott: It's sort of like a foregone thing.

1076
01:03:30,751 --> 01:03:37,576
Rym: I got to a point to where I literally needed someone to attack me to give me an opportunity to attack them back Or I was gonna fail in the.

1077
01:03:37,616 --> 01:03:38,662
Scott: you would have failed the next turn.

1078
01:03:38,823 --> 01:03:40,190
Rym: I would have definitely failed the next turn.

1079
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:43,423
Scott: There's no way you could have because I had built everything I could possibly build.

1080
01:03:43,805 --> 01:03:45,130
Rym: all my roosts were on the board.

1081
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:47,624
Rym: Oh, I literally could not have built another roost.

1082
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:48,067
Scott: Yep.

1083
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:50,079
Rym: Yeah So my government would have collapsed.

1084
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,934
Scott: even if you fail just once with the birds You're still likely.

1085
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,442
Scott: you're still close to winning.

1086
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:56,130
Scott: you need to so you need to fail twice.

1087
01:03:56,310 --> 01:04:07,690
Rym: I feel like a normal strategy for the birds is to pick a leader have a strategy push it hard fail Strategically at the right moment start your decree over and then use that to win the game.

1088
01:04:08,092 --> 01:04:11,874
Scott: The thing is when you start the decree over too late It will.

1089
01:04:12,055 --> 01:04:14,210
Scott: it won't become big and strong enough that right?

1090
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:20,423
Scott: You're taking too few Points, you're trying to put yourself when you when you fail, right?

1091
01:04:20,563 --> 01:04:21,647
Scott: It's like oh shit.

1092
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:22,830
Scott: I don't have enough actions.

1093
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:25,226
Scott: It's late game and I'm taking like piddly actions.

1094
01:04:25,247 --> 01:04:25,750
Scott: There's no good.

1095
01:04:25,831 --> 01:04:33,163
Scott: I think you need to get big and fail fast So that way you could those the the second decree that I got reset.

1096
01:04:33,444 --> 01:04:39,509
Scott: the weak actions are still early enough in the game And you'll have strong but barely doable actions towards the end.

1097
01:04:39,851 --> 01:04:42,510
Scott: But assuming you can't pull off a miracle like never fail.

1098
01:04:42,831 --> 01:04:56,150
Rym: But then when stuff gets interesting is like other players like maybe the cats will work hard by buying the otters support to Make it impossible for the decree to work at a point when the birds did not prepare for that.

1099
01:04:56,452 --> 01:04:58,250
Rym: I think that can be fun and weird.

1100
01:04:58,451 --> 01:05:10,510
Scott: So I think that the thing with this game is right is like even though I've played it three four times It's still like a low-level like understanding even though I understand everyone's but the lizard folk and the cats kind of how they work.

1101
01:05:11,152 --> 01:05:12,355
Scott: Is that you're?

1102
01:05:12,515 --> 01:05:14,501
Scott: you have this so such an asymmetric?

1103
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:16,186
Scott: you're playing your own game thing.

1104
01:05:16,226 --> 01:05:27,126
Scott: going on that until you completely understand everyone else's thing and Everyone else understands everyone else's thing then you can get into the play of like aha.

1105
01:05:27,146 --> 01:05:31,118
Scott: I Know how decrees work as I've played birds like three times.

1106
01:05:31,138 --> 01:05:35,350
Scott: Yeah, I'm not the birds now, but I know how to fuck those birds up.

1107
01:05:35,491 --> 01:05:37,690
Scott: Let's make sure Rym's decree fails next turn.

1108
01:05:38,071 --> 01:05:40,720
Scott: I don't think he can make three moves if we do this.

1109
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:41,823
Rym: cuz like I wasn't.

1110
01:05:41,863 --> 01:05:42,666
Scott: Rym's like shit.

1111
01:05:42,847 --> 01:05:48,627
Rym: watch a first playthrough with naive players and three or four players like the wooden alliance just always wins because it wasn't.

1112
01:05:48,648 --> 01:05:52,567
Scott: Alliance is very Straightforward gets a lot of points and automatically wins if it's not quelled.

1113
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:53,070
Rym: if yeah.

1114
01:05:53,291 --> 01:06:01,555
Rym: So you watch advanced players play this game and like the cats and the birds will both be like, all right Let's pause hostilities first.

1115
01:06:01,595 --> 01:06:02,458
Scott: take out the communist.

1116
01:06:02,478 --> 01:06:04,624
Scott: the first order of business is like always.

1117
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:06,089
Scott: don't let green win now.

1118
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:07,587
Scott: Let's see who else will win.

1119
01:06:08,692 --> 01:06:10,605
Scott: But then say some ingredients in the game.

1120
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:11,230
Scott: You might have a green.

1121
01:06:11,552 --> 01:06:14,650
Scott: Yeah, you could play red, you know, you could play otters and red and blue.

1122
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:15,737
Rym: I forget the list of like.

1123
01:06:15,858 --> 01:06:17,469
Rym: what are all the combinations that work?

1124
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,814
Rym: Yeah But don't let any.

1125
01:06:19,914 --> 01:06:26,090
Rym: this game only takes a super long time to play if the people at your table just suck at playing game.

1126
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:29,830
Scott: I'm sure there must also be teaching videos on YouTube to help you learn.

1127
01:06:29,991 --> 01:06:38,320
Scott: Yeah, you know cuz it is, you know Like I said if you're a gamer if you're listening to a podcast if you're going to a gaming con if you play other Board games you can play this game.

1128
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:39,829
Scott: Don't be scared away by it.

1129
01:06:40,472 --> 01:06:44,668
Scott: The cute animal creatures should help you but it's not the simplest.

1130
01:06:44,728 --> 01:06:51,225
Scott: you do need You know some help learning it, but someone to teach you read the rules read them again Watch a video.

1131
01:06:51,751 --> 01:06:58,841
Rym: Do one thing I noticed that works that I like about this game like a big part of why I think it was fun even Though those learning games and I've never seen a game do that.

1132
01:06:58,881 --> 01:06:59,605
Rym: I've seen a few games.

1133
01:06:59,645 --> 01:06:59,926
Rym: do this.

1134
01:06:59,946 --> 01:07:00,750
Rym: Well, but it's rare.

1135
01:07:01,572 --> 01:07:04,310
Rym: You only need to to like to have fun with the game.

1136
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:15,590
Rym: you only need to fully understand how to play your character and You only really need the flavor text of the rest of the characters to have a vague idea of how to handle them.

1137
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:22,170
Rym: Yep Like just knowing that you can trade with the otters and the otter player will explain how to trade with them.

1138
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:23,015
Rym: It's really straightforward.

1139
01:07:23,055 --> 01:07:25,550
Scott: knowing that if you do this that will help that play.

1140
01:07:25,573 --> 01:07:31,766
Rym: Yeah If I play with if I trade with the otters too much It'll make them strong is enough for me to play in a game where there are otters.

1141
01:07:31,846 --> 01:07:34,460
Scott: if I do this stuff I'll be giving too many cards to green.

1142
01:07:34,501 --> 01:07:36,010
Scott: Stop giving so many cards to green.

1143
01:07:36,211 --> 01:07:40,330
Scott: Yeah, if I do this then you know, the birds decree will be too easy.

1144
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:40,973
Scott: Don't do that.

1145
01:07:41,254 --> 01:07:44,649
Rym: And that's the thing the game the fiction of the game.

1146
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:45,693
Scott: Don't give.

1147
01:07:45,733 --> 01:07:49,186
Scott: don't give the vagabond all the good items that they want and this only give them some.

1148
01:07:49,247 --> 01:07:50,130
Rym: this what I think coal.

1149
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:59,398
Rym: We're brought to that world brought to the table that the fiction of the game itself and the flavor text gives you Reasonably effective heuristics to play the game.

1150
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:00,021
Scott: Absolutely.

1151
01:08:00,121 --> 01:08:02,330
Rym: Like that is a rare thing in games.

1152
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:04,495
Rym: Treasure that when you find it.

1153
01:08:04,696 --> 01:08:04,896
Rym: Yep.

1154
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:09,189
Scott: So yeah, there's expansion which adds the otters and lizards, right?

1155
01:08:09,229 --> 01:08:11,183
Scott: Yep The game's super hot.

1156
01:08:11,324 --> 01:08:16,069
Scott: Yeah, the lizard There's keep printing these things as long as people keep buying them.

1157
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:21,358
Scott: The only reason I'm not buying one is because anytime I would play the game I would be with someone who already owns it.

1158
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:29,010
Scott: So there's no reason for me to buy my own copy You know unless suddenly I've got like some people who want to play it with me who don't have one.

1159
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:33,950
Rym: Yep, and if you find the game takes way too long like even after teaching games get better again.

1160
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:35,337
Rym: Yeah, find better people to play with.

1161
01:08:35,841 --> 01:08:37,169
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't take that long for us to play.

1162
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:40,550
Rym: I'm sure someone's implemented this in tabletop simulator or something.

1163
01:08:47,237 --> 01:08:49,760
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
