1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,372
Rym: It's Thursday February 14th 2019.

2
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:12,813
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:15,420
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:19,787
Rym: We're talking about doing laundry because that's exciting.

5
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:22,547
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,714 --> 00:00:25,923
Rym: So I was setting up to do GeekNights.

7
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:30,730
Rym: so a little while ago And I'm creative cloud like was open and I saw it had a notification.

8
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:35,616
Rym: So I figured out there's probably some update to like Photoshop or so Notifications for other shit.

9
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:37,850
Scott: now that are not updates to software.

10
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,886
Rym: I've made some configuration changes to where that I think I only get the ones I care about.

11
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:44,997
Rym: but I click on it just to see and Sure enough.

12
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:48,437
Rym: There was a new version of like Media encoder and premiere.

13
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:51,350
Rym: so I clicked on that and I noticed something I hadn't noticed.

14
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:56,448
Rym: I noticed that the last round of updates left the old versions in place.

15
00:00:56,468 --> 00:01:12,330
Rym: So I had Photoshop and then I had the newer Photoshop that all the people who are bad at Photoshop We're complaining about because they fixed one of the most glaring UX problems in Photoshop where you don't have to hold control if you want to keep the aspect ratio and a transform by default.

16
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:14,495
Rym: People are really mad about that change.

17
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:15,337
Rym: I don't understand why.

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,630
Scott: so I noticed that for whatever reason I people get mad about any change.

19
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:19,811
Scott: Right.

20
00:01:19,832 --> 00:01:21,570
Scott: We've talked about that a thousand times, right?

21
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,508
Scott: Oh sicko sign.

22
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:31,160
Rym: but I noticed that the creative cloud had done a thing where it kept the old stupid version of Photoshop and Audition and all these things I just never noticed.

23
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:35,819
Rym: so I found the option That says fucking just keep me up to date.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,124
Rym: Never keep old versions.

25
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:37,867
Rym: full steam ahead.

26
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:38,670
Rym: Damn the torpedoes.

27
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,349
Scott: Yeah, I've had that version that for a while.

28
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:46,210
Rym: So I enabled it and I uninstalled manually every old the old audition the old everything.

29
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:56,130
Rym: So because I just hit the windows key and type like a you and I said enter I've been used in audition 2018 for a while now, like even though 2019 has been out for a while.

30
00:01:56,713 --> 00:02:12,070
Rym: so this is the first GeekNights and recording 2019 and it highlights the audio that's being recorded currently in like Super red and it took me a second to realize that that was because I have a new version not because something's going wrong.

31
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:16,340
Scott: Yeah, you know in terms of thing people getting mad about changes.

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,470
Scott: It's like remember people are so mad about the Twitter redesign.

33
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:26,996
Scott: Oh, yeah, we're so mad about Microsoft Office ribbons Just a couple weeks ago.

34
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:31,350
Scott: people are mad about the new slack logo and I'm sure someone out there just now said it's still ugly.

35
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:31,913
Scott: But guess what?

36
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:34,305
Scott: Everyone stopped giving a shit and slack still works.

37
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:35,190
Scott: You're still using slack.

38
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,335
Scott: So what the fuck does it make?

39
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:47,690
Rym: the new slack logo is bad because it is primarily lazy Too derivative of every other goddamn logo these days and somehow incorporated like what both a swastika and a dick.

40
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:48,915
Scott: Yeah, but you know what?

41
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,240
Scott: Uh, it doesn't matter.

42
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:51,767
Scott: It's of course doesn't?

43
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:52,470
Scott: it's not a problem.

44
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:58,790
Scott: It's like you're gonna in in five years if they try to change it again, you'd be like, ah change it back to the dick swastika.

45
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,650
Rym: Well Look at Long Island City.

46
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,670
Rym: There's this giant like ugly neon Pepsi like ad from a long time ago on the waterfront.

47
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,639
Scott: It's like I say same thing with a sicko sign of Boston.

48
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,970
Rym: the same thing with the tour de fell, right?

49
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,503
Scott: All right, so but yeah, don't get mad just cuz there's something changed.

50
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:15,924
Rym: Yep.

51
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:22,750
Rym: I'm not change yourself I was startled by the fact that there's all this red in the interface that I'd never seen before but it's fine.

52
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:23,314
Rym: I just had to.

53
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:27,850
Scott: red is not a good color to use for something scary But I guess red does mean recordings that make sense.

54
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,338
Rym: Yeah, especially cuz that red matches the red of the.

55
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,480
Rym: I have activated this channel to record from some of you know That all that biz.

56
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:34,926
Rym: Mm-hmm.

57
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:46,150
Rym: Anyway, actually before we start the show, I'm curious all of you out there if I was to do a patreon like exclusive thing Would you like like a real talk tutorial how to use audition?

58
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:54,284
Scott: I mean, yes anything you say would you like someone's gonna say yes and and no one who's gonna say no is even gonna say I only want to do it if a lot of people say yes.

59
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:58,341
Rym: if one person says yes You can go Google for someone else who did a less good tutorial.

60
00:03:58,542 --> 00:03:59,084
Scott: I'm pretty sure.

61
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:02,274
Scott: if you have Adobe audition Adobe has like.

62
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:04,623
Scott: this is an Adobe tutorials like app.

63
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:06,330
Scott: Oh that is it on the iPhone.

64
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:07,238
Rym: So I've looked at those.

65
00:04:07,258 --> 00:04:14,370
Rym: it's totally an aside But I have watched the Adobe videos and they're pretty good and I've watched a lot of tutorial videos for this kind of software.

66
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:15,985
Rym: What I've noticed is that?

67
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,736
Rym: Almost no one talks like.

68
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:27,838
Rym: they talk about how to use audition, but they don't tell you how audio works and Nothing seems to tell you that.

69
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:37,230
Rym: I can't find tutorials that actually explain to people Sufficiently like how to use an auto ducker like what a compressor really does and how to tune it or any of that stuff for podcast.

70
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:38,549
Scott: I think you generally go to school.

71
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:41,445
Rym: Yeah, but it's not that hard to learn.

72
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:45,822
Scott: I learned it by reading Every single computer, you know thing even Stack Overflow.

73
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:48,230
Scott: nothing teaches you how a computer works.

74
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,228
Scott: They're all teaching you except for unless you take like the MIT open courseware, right?

75
00:04:53,150 --> 00:05:03,500
Rym: I guess what I noticed is that the only good resources I found for that stuff are the way I learned which is Literally all these textbooks I bought used from the 90s from like schools on how to do audio.

76
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:13,005
Scott: Yeah People who have educations and know things Don't often end up actually teaching the fundamentals of those things in it for free.

77
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:14,770
Scott: Yeah, it's just a thing.

78
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:18,370
Scott: But as a result online you find specific tutorials to do specific things.

79
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,970
Scott: You can find plenty of like baking videos that are like hey, here's how to bake this specific thing.

80
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,596
Scott: But you can't find something that is like.

81
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:28,086
Scott: here is the fundamental theory of baking.

82
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:32,497
Scott: I Can't find that on you If you know where that is on the internet like how.

83
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:36,850
Scott: I can you know like just from knowing about the chemistry of flour.

84
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:43,314
Scott: Invent a recipe for a thing without having to like take a recipe from a cookbook Right.

85
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:44,579
Scott: I've never found any.

86
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,370
Scott: I figured the only way to do that is to go to culinary school, right?

87
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,878
Scott: Oh, yeah, I guess there's no other way to learn that.

88
00:05:50,079 --> 00:06:07,947
Rym: but I guess it's that I specifically see a lot of tutorials that explain How to do a specific thing in Photoshop or a specific thing in audition, but they kind I don't want to say they teach it wrong but they teach it in a way to where it explains why so many YouTube videos and So many podcasts sound like such absolute dog shit,

89
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:08,409
Scott: man.

90
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:11,979
Rym: So yeah, there's actually some really good news.

91
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,744
Rym: This got leaked a while ago.

92
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:15,410
Rym: Like no not a while ago a week ago.

93
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,414
Scott: Well a week ago.

94
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:23,289
Scott: They were like they threatened it was out and then today they're just like, alright We're going through with our threat and we're like, well good.

95
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:29,730
Rym: So if you didn't know because it's important that I live in LIC like where Amazon was gonna build their stupid headquarters.

96
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,190
Rym: It's like right there.

97
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,629
Scott: We can see it from the window where if they built it we would be able to see it like from here.

98
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:37,450
Scott: You know block our view of fireworks.

99
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,634
Scott: That's why it's a good like.

100
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:43,290
Rym: I literally walk past that thing on a regular basis like the place where it is, right?

101
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:49,110
Scott: So basically Amazon was they created this big hullabaloo like we're gonna build a building.

102
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:50,935
Scott: Every city and state.

103
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:56,530
Scott: please fight to see who will pay us the most to build our building there as opposed to somewhere else.

104
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,916
Rym: Yep, so you have cities being like.

105
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:08,530
Rym: we will kill every adult male child in our city for you right like Cities were willing to be like you don't ever pay taxes will give you land.

106
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:12,050
Scott: Please just come right because Amazon won't pay the taxes.

107
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:18,310
Scott: But the theory is that all the employees of Amazon Amazon still has to pay the payroll tax stuff like that.

108
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:24,430
Rym: Well, the New York incentive was they would actually give Amazon like a 40k credit against payroll.

109
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:36,890
Scott: Basically The way the way it would work theoretically right is that you don't care about paying them to come Because in the long term right you every all these cities and states are afraid of becoming Detroit, right?

110
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,214
Scott: Which is?

111
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:40,519
Scott: it's like oh, no We lost all our industry and now our town is a crap hole.

112
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:43,490
Scott: you want businesses where you live because then it makes you where?

113
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:51,707
Scott: You live a flourishing place with lots of revenues Things you've got seeing stuff you've got.

114
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:52,430
Rym: live in there.

115
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:58,430
Rym: You've got like low like mid mid-tier cities that don't want to become low-tier cities.

116
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:04,247
Rym: You've also got low-tier cities and non cities that are hoping this will put them on the map, right?

117
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:07,535
Scott: So obviously Amazon was only planning.

118
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:08,197
Scott: it was all it was.

119
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:18,607
Scott: obviously was only ever gonna go to New York, you know San Francisco Brooke right places where there are people want to.

120
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:19,612
Scott: you know We're tech.

121
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:24,890
Scott: people want to live and work and DC to be close to the government and the Washington Post that visas owns.

122
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,183
Scott: So yeah, they already already weren't gonna go anywhere else, right?

123
00:08:28,244 --> 00:08:29,710
Scott: Oh, they have Nashville office too, right?

124
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,510
Scott: Yeah, the locations were bracing already decided like, you know, Nebraska you had no chance.

125
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,116
Scott: That doesn't matter what you were gonna give them.

126
00:08:36,157 --> 00:08:39,150
Scott: You could have been like, yeah free rent for a million years free land.

127
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,907
Scott: They would have not gone to Nebraska in New York.

128
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,910
Rym: now I can't hire good engineer Like.

129
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:44,854
Rym: I cannot hire people.

130
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:49,270
Rym: there aren't enough people in New York City doing these kinds of jobs to hire right anyway.

131
00:08:49,651 --> 00:09:07,350
Scott: So the what happened in New York is that the governor and the mayor usually don't get along despite being in the same political party actually came together and Bribed not bribed the legally but created an a plan to you know an offer like Amazon.

132
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:13,839
Scott: here's all the great things we will give you if you come to New York and They did that with zero input from anyone else.

133
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:19,874
Scott: It was completely the executive branch of government all in its own in secret Developing this offer.

134
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:23,287
Rym: polling for the idea of hey, would you like Amazon to come to New York?

135
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:23,930
Rym: was pretty high.

136
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:27,330
Scott: Supposedly 70% of people were in favor.

137
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,337
Rym: Supposedly, well, here's the thing.

138
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,950
Rym: I am in favor of Amazon coming to New York.

139
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,628
Scott: Well, I mean anyone who wants to come to New York.

140
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,837
Scott: It has enough money to do so.

141
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:40,005
Rym: you're allowed to buy land, but that's the thing.

142
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:41,230
Scott: you're allowed to build buildings.

143
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,040
Scott: I can't stop you.

144
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:42,890
Rym: Here's the thing.

145
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,619
Rym: The only reason Google has offices.

146
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,790
Scott: they're buying all of Chelsea market whether you like it or not.

147
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:55,621
Rym: The only reason a couple Amazon wants to come to a place like New York is because this is where all the people who can Do that work live but you come to New York because it's New York.

148
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,770
Scott: That's the only incentive you should need to come here.

149
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:00,710
Scott: Yep, so apparently that was the incentive they needed to come here.

150
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,601
Rym: 100% fine with Amazon coming like any company.

151
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:05,370
Scott: could I mean there are a lot of negative?

152
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,629
Scott: Consequences of them coming like all kinds of gentrification fucking up the neighborhood etc, etc.

153
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,765
Scott: Which is gonna happen anyway, but in principle, I can't stop you from coming if you buy land.

154
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:25,390
Rym: you you're you're allowed to buy land I mean, but here's the thing New York City or really no city should give the richest company in the world tax incentives to move to their city.

155
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,610
Scott: It's like the examples I used right for analogies, right?

156
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,489
Scott: The first analogy I came up with was like, all right, you're throwing a party.

157
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:34,197
Scott: Yeah, you it's in no invitation.

158
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,550
Scott: Anyone can come to my party and someone is like, oh your party looks pretty good.

159
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:45,389
Scott: I'd come in there if you gave me ten bucks and I'd be like you can come in the party But like not giving you ten bucks, dude.

160
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:52,584
Rym: But the dudes like oh, but if I come to your party like cool people will come because they heard I was here Well, then you can fuck off.

161
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:53,610
Scott: I'm not giving you ten dollars.

162
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,660
Scott: Yeah, you don't want to come to my party don't come.

163
00:10:55,681 --> 00:11:01,869
Scott: and in this case instead of saying Alright, don't pay me ten bucks, but I'll come in your party and they just took their ball and went home.

164
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:03,455
Scott: Yes, it's the other the other.

165
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:06,364
Rym: and so what I read is that basically it's not.

166
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:08,350
Rym: oh, they're moving HQ to somewhere else.

167
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:10,528
Rym: As far as I can tell there's not fucking doing it at all now.

168
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,690
Rym: So I guess hire the same people they were gonna hire anyway, probably in New York just in different buildings.

169
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,302
Scott: They even admitted in their thing like yeah, we'll continue our expand our existing New York office.

170
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:24,050
Rym: It's like okay because here's the deal.

171
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,076
Rym: Amazon needs New York.

172
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:30,410
Rym: There's probably no other city in America where they could hire that number.

173
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,252
Scott: Seattle.

174
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:33,676
Scott: that's pretty much the area.

175
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:38,920
Rym: there are a handful of places in the entire country where you could hire a large number of people with that kind of skill set.

176
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,797
Rym: and New York doesn't need Amazon.

177
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:42,961
Rym: Amazon needs New York.

178
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:49,929
Rym: like someone pointed out that they were worried about Amazon over like just existing in Long Island City our neighborhood over developing it.

179
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:55,407
Rym: The place that Amazon's gonna is already overdeveloped is literally that gentrification.

180
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:56,270
Scott: there is no stopping that.

181
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,390
Scott: you.

182
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:58,130
Rym: I found a funny map that showed something interest.

183
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,924
Rym: There is no stopping that train that the place Amazon was gonna build is Literally the only undeveloped place left in the.

184
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:05,910
Scott: it's not undeveloped.

185
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,566
Scott: It's you know where they have the LIC flea next to the plaques all and the art thing.

186
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:10,490
Rym: Well, it's underdeveloped.

187
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,373
Rym: There's everything there.

188
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:12,456
Rym: It's still right still.

189
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:12,637
Scott: Yes.

190
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:14,282
Rym: It's not the plaques all itself.

191
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:16,610
Rym: It's the thing across that little canal, right?

192
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,202
Rym: Yeah, right over that building is pretty much empty.

193
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:20,688
Rym: It has a bunch of small like.

194
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:24,290
Scott: I went There was that there was like an Instagram ish candy.

195
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:24,832
Scott: It wasn't?

196
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:30,210
Scott: it was one of those events where it's like come here eat free eat food and take Instagram photos.

197
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:32,037
Rym: Oh, actually that gives me.

198
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:33,544
Scott: I went to one of those in that building.

199
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:34,930
Rym: You know, what else was there the other day?

200
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,047
Rym: I don't think you weren't with us.

201
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:45,680
Rym: So me and Emily were walking with the girls and we're gonna go get some food like walk over to like Vernon Jackson area and we're walking by that spot and you know, there's a fence with like that There.

202
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,528
Scott: good luck getting a seat at.

203
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:54,283
Rym: So that one of the one of the lots.

204
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:55,109
Rym: that's part of all this.

205
00:12:55,614 --> 00:13:01,727
Rym: There was a hole cut in the fence Mm-hmm, and there was a bunch of lights in there and a sign that basically said like the secret park.

206
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:02,209
Scott: Mm-hmm.

207
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,312
Rym: So we go in.

208
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:16,089
Rym: a bunch of hipsters had set up a bar with free drinks and a bunch of Christmas lights And a bunch of art installations and we're illegally running a like fancy park party in the vacant lot.

209
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:18,459
Rym: Yep That's what's there right now.

210
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,070
Scott: Anyway, so The argument, you know a lot of people on the internet are actually fighting back at it.

211
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,250
Scott: It's isn't like, you know an onslaught of hooray.

212
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:35,225
Scott: The internet is like half hooray and half boo because all the boo I see are people who don't live in New York and have No, I saw a lot of New York people who are boo, but they were all.

213
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:36,913
Scott: you know, they're all Staten Island I don't know.

214
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:39,830
Scott: some of them were satin on for sure because they were saying come to Staten Island.

215
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:47,170
Rym: Anyway, anyone who says oh no New York won't get those jobs That number of jobs is a drop in the bucket in New York City.

216
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:53,590
Scott: The point is the argument that they were making was like look, you know, you give them three billion But it's only X dollars over whatever.

217
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:59,535
Scott: But if they come we're gonna get you know X dollars and it's like I'd say one We're gonna get the X dollars.

218
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:03,150
Rym: Anyway, my land is gonna turn into something equivalent to HQ.

219
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:12,204
Scott: So my argument my argument against that is like alright, so I'm gonna go into the Apple store and I'm gonna say yo Apple Give me that and brand new top-of-the-line iPhone for $1.

220
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:12,806
Scott: now hear me out.

221
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:22,230
Scott: I know Alright, that's a big discount you're giving me But if you don't you could get is $1 for me or you can get zero dollars, so I'll go get Android.

222
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:25,244
Scott: Yep, and you know, you're missing out on all the money.

223
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:26,169
Scott: I'm gonna spend on apps.

224
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:26,974
Scott: still It's not like I can get.

225
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:27,598
Scott: apps are free.

226
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,786
Rym: So to say no further, right?

227
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,456
Scott: So it's like to take your.

228
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:33,596
Scott: now if you go to the Apple store and try that What does the Apple store say?

229
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:34,802
Scott: they say fuck off and iPhones $1,000.

230
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:35,044
Scott: eat a dick.

231
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:40,330
Scott: So if you come to New York and you're like, oh, I'll give you a whole bunch of money.

232
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,419
Scott: You're gonna get so much taxes if I move in here.

233
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,870
Scott: Just let me have all this stuff tax-free.

234
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:52,169
Rym: It's like so if I paid the same price as everyone else It's long Island City is the Apple store and you pull that shit and we kick you out.

235
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:55,070
Rym: Long Island City the way it's being developed already.

236
00:14:55,371 --> 00:15:00,288
Rym: There are like a thousand people in line behind you who will give me hundreds of dollars for that iPhone.

237
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:01,655
Scott: Yeah $1,000 an iPhone.

238
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:05,132
Rym: Yeah, it's like we don't need Phone.

239
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:05,735
Rym: that's just as good.

240
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:06,819
Scott: It's like it's like bro.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,510
Scott: This is gonna be other people going in that spot.

242
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,255
Scott: It was not you.

243
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,162
Scott: that's let law.

244
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,230
Scott: something's going there.

245
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,979
Rym: That spot is literally the only.

246
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:18,530
Rym: it's like a tiny percentage of the developable land in Long Island City.

247
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:20,650
Rym: It's the only one that isn't yet developed.

248
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:25,090
Rym: Everything else is already like planned for giant skyscrapers and giant buildings.

249
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,126
Rym: Amazon would have been a drop in the bucket and would have ruined the subway.

250
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:35,989
Rym: Yeah, I am Completely great that this happened and it's mostly thanks to our state senator.

251
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,717
Scott: Is he your state senator also?

252
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:39,862
Scott: Yeah, I thought he's.

253
00:15:39,882 --> 00:15:40,686
Scott: I thought he's mine.

254
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:41,670
Rym: I forget we're right on the edge.

255
00:15:42,011 --> 00:15:43,037
Rym: I forget I haven't voted in a while.

256
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,650
Scott: But yeah, so my state senator is this guy Gianaris?

257
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,694
Rym: Exactly where the line is.

258
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:48,377
Rym: I got a look at that.

259
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:53,415
Scott: I don't freaking know but basically he He is like always trying.

260
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:55,302
Scott: he's always in like the New York News.

261
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:57,390
Scott: He's like this in the New York State Senate.

262
00:15:57,531 --> 00:15:59,439
Scott: He is like the second person right?

263
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,087
Scott: Cuz Andrea Stewart cousins is like number one.

264
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:01,589
Scott: He's number two.

265
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,413
Rym: Oh, yeah, we're there.

266
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:02,915
Rym: Look, it's it.

267
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:06,853
Rym: the line actually goes all the way down to The Pulaski.

268
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:07,134
Rym: No.

269
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:17,150
Scott: Anyway, I voted for this guy like twice already, right and Basically Before this whole Amazon thing gerrymandering.

270
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,638
Scott: Yeah before this whole Amazon thing.

271
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,090
Scott: His number one issue was bail reform.

272
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,430
Scott: He was like, let's get rid of cash bail completely.

273
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,426
Scott: That was his number one thing which is a good thing among his many things.

274
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:33,658
Scott: pretty much any time He ever said anything It was always good and he's always like.

275
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,170
Scott: he feels like he's someone who's trying to become governor or something big.

276
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:48,177
Scott: Yes It feels like he's an aspirational Politician because he's always on like the local TV stations like New York one and channel 12 and like local radio Always talking about everything.

277
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,883
Scott: but anytime I ever see him.

278
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:51,810
Scott: He's always saying the right thing.

279
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:55,790
Scott: I hope he it doesn't have like some secret me to stuff like every other white dude.

280
00:16:56,151 --> 00:17:02,610
Rym: You know, I'm in New York does not have a good track record of seemingly awesome white dudes getting to a higher level of government.

281
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,146
Rym: And then immediately I like our past few attorneys general.

282
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:10,463
Rym: Yeah We've had a rough run of attorneys general so far.

283
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:12,450
Scott: He has been a plus dude.

284
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:16,890
Rym: In fact, if you listen to old GeekNights, we talk a lot about New York State attorneys general.

285
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:18,498
Scott: We used to talk a lot about.

286
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:19,743
Scott: that's a real important job.

287
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:20,790
Rym: It is a real important job.

288
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:22,255
Rym: Don't forget there.

289
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,598
Scott: You got Latisha James in there.

290
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:26,990
Rym: There's a special election at the end of the month for what the city advocate.

291
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,515
Scott: No one's gonna vote for that.

292
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:30,101
Rym: That's a really important position.

293
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:33,557
Scott: It's not that important, but it's pretty important I'm still gonna vote for.

294
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:34,364
Rym: well more importantly.

295
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:36,714
Rym: It's kind of Non-partisan.

296
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,079
Rym: there's like 20 people running.

297
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,869
Scott: It's really go look whether you live in New York or not.

298
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,530
Scott: Go search and look at the ballot for the special election because there are no parties in this election.

299
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:50,429
Scott: So everyone running writes in their own party.

300
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:53,657
Scott: So people have written hilarious things.

301
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:57,006
Scott: Yeah as their party like the first person on the ballot.

302
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:58,450
Scott: Their party is fix the MTA.

303
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:01,181
Scott: That is the least funny of them.

304
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:02,570
Rym: I feel like I want to vote for that one.

305
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,561
Rym: I got to do my research and decided to vote basically the hardest left or the hardest for social.

306
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:15,830
Scott: the problem is is I looked at everyone and Basically, most of the choices are pretty left and every single person on the left has like something wrong with them.

307
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:18,039
Scott: It's always they all have a different thing.

308
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:18,460
Scott: That's wrong.

309
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:23,117
Rym: It's like we need to fix climate change Yeah, and vaccines are bad.

310
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,070
Scott: Ah, it's pretty much everything and they're all crook slightly slow.

311
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:31,810
Scott: See, I guess you're gonna have to prioritize which thing you think is more important.

312
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:39,373
Rym: So I think the thing that's most important about this is that the government was like the the effectively the government of the state and the city Wanted this.

313
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:41,140
Rym: the business interests wanted it.

314
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,730
Rym: the richest the executive branch wanted it.

315
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,852
Scott: yep, the legislative the new legislative branch Did not.

316
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:48,115
Rym: the richest met.

317
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:53,428
Rym: the richest and most powerful man and company in the world wanted it and pretended to on it.

318
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:59,784
Rym: Yep and Basically the people who live here and one state senator were like, you know what now?

319
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:00,907
Rym: and that was enough.

320
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:04,397
Rym: a lot of state centers Yeah, but this state senator was on the committee.

321
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:08,690
Rym: that as far as I can tell I know he was because of the Amazon thing.

322
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:12,317
Scott: right Andrea just appointed him.

323
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,364
Scott: Yep to get a seat on the committee.

324
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:15,850
Scott: that would give him veto power.

325
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,575
Rym: Yes, he had veto power He didn't.

326
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:23,769
Scott: he's not on the committee yet Cuomo would have had to put him on the committee and there would have been some crazy fighting if he would have been like.

327
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,503
Scott: no I don't want to sign you off on the right.

328
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:26,764
Scott: Yeah.

329
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:34,185
Rym: Anyway, so Direct action by the people affected worked against one of the most powerful things on earth.

330
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:47,016
Rym: That's actually kind of amazing I'm and it goes to show when we talked on geek dance a little while ago like the Latin most recent election New York State's government fixed a bunch of issues and Same.

331
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:48,390
Scott: it's the same state Senate.

332
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:53,630
Rym: Yes The same state Senate that might give us single-payer health care in the state and fix a bunch of issues.

333
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:57,203
Rym: This is like the first thing they could accomplish since the election.

334
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:57,725
Rym: That's big.

335
00:19:58,408 --> 00:19:59,070
Rym: So it's big news.

336
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,690
Rym: The moral is if you're mad about something like also we we avoided setting a precedent, right?

337
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,964
Scott: It's like alright if we pay them and then they come it sets this precedent like alright.

338
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:19,185
Scott: now every company in the world can create Sort of fight and competition between all the different You know local governments to see where they go to sort of run down their tax bill.

339
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:20,730
Scott: and it's like no you can't do that.

340
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,946
Scott: If you try to do that, you're just gonna say no fuck off.

341
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:23,570
Rym: I want to go further.

342
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:28,670
Rym: I want to say if a company makes too much money They're gonna pay an extra tax to have the privilege of even opening an office here.

343
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,623
Scott: I think you should have to pay extra money.

344
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,190
Scott: had the privilege of even doing business here.

345
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:33,685
Rym: Yeah.

346
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:40,450
Scott: And if you pass the cost of money above a certain size you gotta pay and you try to pass the cost off onto consumers.

347
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:42,043
Scott: We don't know the tech.

348
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:48,730
Scott: you can't do that If you're charging people in New York more money than you're charging people in Indiana, then we'll find you the difference.

349
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:50,909
Rym: Like here's a very specific example of that.

350
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:55,702
Rym: So the traditional wisdom among libertarians who don't know what they're talking about.

351
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,890
Rym: Is that so all libertarians all libertarians?

352
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:07,150
Rym: Is that small businesses don't start in New York and there's not a good startup culture here because state taxes and city taxes are so high.

353
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,070
Rym: So they incorporate in other places.

354
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:18,303
Rym: But the reality is a shit ton of those companies incorporate here and gladly pay those taxes because the benefits of being in New York Far outweigh that cost.

355
00:21:18,383 --> 00:21:19,330
Scott: Yeah, I pay my company.

356
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:20,776
Scott: I pay my huge ass rent.

357
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:23,790
Scott: it gets people say oh your huge ass rent gets you this tiny apartment.

358
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:27,370
Scott: No, and I'm like central goddamn part and it's like yeah, but my huge ass rent.

359
00:21:27,531 --> 00:21:33,458
Scott: I can just walk over and see every single movie ever even really Super rare ones that get a limited run.

360
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:35,084
Rym: I could just go see free opera.

361
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,690
Rym: I just free opera here.

362
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:40,970
Scott: I can go to the Madison Square Garden and it's a subway ride home and I'm gonna deal with the parking.

363
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:43,018
Scott: Yeah or driving I can.

364
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:45,890
Rym: I can walk over there and laugh at the spot that was gonna be Amazon.

365
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,048
Scott: I can see legendary historic works of art for free.

366
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:50,973
Rym: just up there They are.

367
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:51,757
Rym: I can watch.

368
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:53,870
Scott: that's all included in my rent and tag.

369
00:21:54,030 --> 00:22:03,009
Rym: I can watch the Rangers lose and then it's only like a 10-minute subway ride home instead of an hour drive and I can get Any cuisine of food immediately after the game even though it's super late at night.

370
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:09,134
Scott: Haha It's like those are all the things you're getting for that money and you're basically Sagar it don't?

371
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:10,521
Scott: you could pay the same money.

372
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:17,870
Scott: and if you got all those things Yeah Guess what your apartment in podunk would just be equally small because you spent your money on that other stuff.

373
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,275
Rym: Look at that from a business perspective.

374
00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:20,760
Rym: You need someone who knows.

375
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:29,950
Rym: I don't know IBM webs fair MQ horse like animal husbandry and I'm trying to think of another third thing and audio engineering.

376
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:34,766
Rym: You'll probably get ten resumes inside of an hour if you're in New York and hiring for that.

377
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,940
Scott: Yeah, but if you're in, Nebraska You're gonna get one guy.

378
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,270
Scott: I got a guy who knows about corn.

379
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,582
Scott: You'll get a guy who knows the horse guy the horse guy probably.

380
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:42,904
Scott: Yeah.

381
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:44,450
Scott: Good luck with the web sphere guy.

382
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:52,406
Rym: Also if anyone knows of IBM web sphere MQ Edmund in New York, I'm actually looking for one.

383
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:53,570
Scott: you actually use that.

384
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:57,219
Scott: Yeah, I got There's reasons.

385
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,290
Scott: I thought you knew web sphere.

386
00:22:59,453 --> 00:23:01,504
Rym: Do not let anyone know that I know about was fair.

387
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:03,454
Scott: I thought you knew it though You were at IBM.

388
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:06,425
Rym: as far as far as people in my company.

389
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,769
Rym: No, I don't know anything about web.

390
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,797
Rym: sure I want to keep it that way.

391
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:11,075
Scott: I Should let them know.

392
00:23:11,196 --> 00:23:12,969
Rym: do not tell anyone that I know about web sphere.

393
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:25,847
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

394
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:33,048
Rym: so if you're a longtime GeekNights listener one thing you might know is that I'm a Super rollercoaster nerd like.

395
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:37,614
Rym: I'm that guy where you're like, oh, that's a really tall rollercoaster and I'm like, yeah That's a B&M.

396
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:43,929
Rym: You can tell because of the sound it makes and how it's got that little bit at the beginning and see how the tracks are Shaped differently like it's.

397
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:44,956
Rym: it's a problem.

398
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:47,572
Rym: So This video is really good.

399
00:23:47,612 --> 00:23:58,665
Rym: You don't need to be a weird rollercoaster to understand it, but it basically talks about how B&M roller coasters this one company that makes a certain kind of roller coaster They have one to find.

400
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:01,780
Rym: one of their defining characteristics is that they're really loud.

401
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:09,747
Rym: They make this like it's hard to describe but they make this really smooth resonant whooshing sound When they come over that first hill like.

402
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:11,595
Rym: it's a very distinctive and loud sound.

403
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,920
Scott: wouldn't you want it to be quiet though?

404
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,240
Scott: Why would you want a loud rollercoaster?

405
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,620
Rym: Cuz it's loud in a fun way like when you're riding in a like you're driving a sports car.

406
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:19,039
Rym: That is a really fun loud sound.

407
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:23,299
Scott: Just use speakers and make a fake sound.

408
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:24,943
Rym: Why this isn't?

409
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:29,561
Rym: it's not like a Harley where they make it shitty on purpose so it makes the sound it's more like The.

410
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:34,020
Rym: the engineering of the roller coaster had this side effect where it sounds a particular way.

411
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:44,339
Rym: That's fine in a normal amusement park But if you have an amusement park that has a bunch of houses around it You can't have this loud ass roller coaster at the edge of the park.

412
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:52,720
Rym: So this video explains how this problem is solved and it literally involved filling the tracks with sand.

413
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:54,346
Scott: Hey, we're running out of sand.

414
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:55,229
Scott: Don't use sand on that.

415
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:55,670
Rym: Yeah.

416
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,915
Rym: Well, they're using sand for this.

417
00:24:56,935 --> 00:24:59,786
Rym: Yeah, and you know, it's even worse They got to use the good sand.

418
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:02,540
Scott: No, but put that sand back on the beach.

419
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:05,151
Rym: So what it talks about rather be on the beach.

420
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:11,838
Rym: the cool thing is they for this one roller coaster They filled the whole fucking thing with sand but because like the shoot like the metal tubes.

421
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,080
Rym: Yeah Well, no, uh, let me find the diagram.

422
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,220
Rym: So they didn't fill the metal tubes because they would have to cut every tube open fill it with sand and close it.

423
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,839
Rym: So they filled the box that holds the tubes up.

424
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:24,799
Rym: That's a lot of sand.

425
00:25:25,384 --> 00:25:34,965
Rym: but then because of this all the Future version of this days that they designed if they built a roller coaster that uses this particular type of like setup and they knew It had to be quiet.

426
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,766
Rym: They fill the tubes with sand from the beginning Using a way less sand.

427
00:25:39,107 --> 00:25:40,813
Rym: and this talks about how like.

428
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:44,300
Rym: here's an example of a job That's hard to hire for the road.

429
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:50,440
Rym: The Canada Water Land needed to hire an acoustical engineer to tell them how to make a roller coaster quieter.

430
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:57,334
Scott: Imagine having that job grease it up Make a faster okey-dokey just cover the whole thing in grease.

431
00:25:57,635 --> 00:25:58,679
Rym: Have you got any grease?

432
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:01,189
Scott: Really fish like.

433
00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:12,340
Scott: imagine if like, you know The roller coaster had like the top quality instead of like wheels just like the top quality ball bearings as wheels like sealed in on the track and the track was super lubricated.

434
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:22,251
Scott: and Um, like it's like so grease that I could like push the coaster along because it was so so Surprised how easy it is to move a coaster car.

435
00:26:22,492 --> 00:26:31,037
Scott: I'm just saying like, you know Yeah If it was like if you even if you just take like a penny and grease it up and put it on a flat piece Of plastic and grease it up and slide it around.

436
00:26:31,077 --> 00:26:32,887
Scott: It's like Right.

437
00:26:32,928 --> 00:26:34,519
Scott: So just imagine a roller coaster like that.

438
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:40,458
Rym: But anyway, this video is like the right level of explaining this without going too deep into the roller coaster.

439
00:26:40,478 --> 00:26:41,200
Rym: grog nard stuff.

440
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:42,546
Scott: Yeah, it's a good video.

441
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:55,816
Scott: So I found a video that was so Rym Oh That I had to claim it as thing of the day so that Rym would not perhaps stumble upon it on his own and use It as thing of the day before me because it is a a plus tier thing of the day.

442
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:56,660
Rym: that has happened before.

443
00:26:56,801 --> 00:26:59,214
Rym: Scott'll be like hey check out this thing the day and I'll be like.

444
00:26:59,274 --> 00:27:00,340
Rym: I saw that we could go on Fark.

445
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:01,103
Rym: I claim it.

446
00:27:01,144 --> 00:27:01,686
Rym: It's mine.

447
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:02,450
Rym: Here's proof.

448
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,863
Rym: I saw it before you anyway, so It's also.

449
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:08,033
Scott: I'm a rewatching it adventure time for the bidding.

450
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,400
Scott: I'm like in season 5 somewhere.

451
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:11,890
Rym: That's when it starts that the plotty stuff start.

452
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:19,880
Scott: now the plotty stuff actually starts in season 1 does But there's a few people keep having this feeling that like adventure time is like is not plotty from the beginning.

453
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,274
Scott: No, it's pretty much all the plot stuff is like in like super early.

454
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:24,880
Rym: It's like right after the gun grinder.

455
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:27,019
Scott: It's like when you watch it for the second time.

456
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:31,559
Scott: It feels like that they had the entire show planned from the start even though they probably did.

457
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,649
Rym: Where a Marceline's dad is like.

458
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:36,298
Rym: you are the most evil thing I've ever

459
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:57,340
Scott: encountered Exactly anyway, so here is the famous bacon pancakes Famous bacon pancake song which is amazing In like a zillion different languages, so it's great because a you get to hear this in zillion different languages And they're all using the same tune, but B You get to hear the Jake voice actor from every different country.

460
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:00,592
Rym: Yeah, because the Jake voice actor is a very important voice actor for this show.

461
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,940
Rym: Oh, yeah, this video is real good.

462
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,144
Rym: This is my jam.

463
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:11,705
Scott: the problem is is like it's that same guy was a Joe DiMaggio, not Joe DiMaggio John DiMaggio John DiMaggio, I think right.

464
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:13,270
Scott: and it's like now.

465
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,976
Scott: It's whenever I see bender.

466
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,320
Rym: I hear Jake I hear Jake.

467
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:24,080
Scott: So because I watched more adventure time more recently than future I when I so it used to be that Jake was bender when I first started watching adventure time.

468
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,632
Scott: But now but now bender is Jake was it's all.

469
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:32,060
Scott: it's like 90% the same voice Even though he is a talented voice actor who can do other voices.

470
00:28:32,622 --> 00:28:35,593
Scott: He uses that same almost exact same voice to those two characters.

471
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:35,874
Rym: Yep.

472
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:37,520
Scott: It's not exactly the same.

473
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,649
Scott: It is slightly different, but it's very similar.

474
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:40,311
Rym: Yeah, you're running.

475
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:45,027
Rym: There's a few characters between like Archer Steven universe adventure time.

476
00:28:45,048 --> 00:28:47,795
Rym: there's a few voice actors that you just can't not hear them.

477
00:28:48,116 --> 00:28:48,257
Scott: Well.

478
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:49,843
Scott: There's a There's a.

479
00:28:49,864 --> 00:28:51,837
Rym: there was a Benjamin you hear him an archer.

480
00:28:51,878 --> 00:29:00,294
Scott: then here There was an adventure episode I rewatched recently where there was a character that was obviously John Hodgman Who was just doing his own voice yeah, and not acting.

481
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:02,103
Scott: and there's also What's the?

482
00:29:02,846 --> 00:29:05,154
Scott: the woman who does Mabel in Gravity Falls?

483
00:29:05,435 --> 00:29:05,576
Rym: Oh?

484
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:06,098
Rym: Yeah?

485
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:06,680
Scott: What's her name?

486
00:29:07,923 --> 00:29:08,104
Rym: She's.

487
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,915
Scott: I knew her name, and then I forgot it.

488
00:29:10,197 --> 00:29:21,388
Rym: well also I'm pretty sure the Fluttershy voice actress did the ponies in the new DuckTales, maybe but anyway Mabel I forget the the woman's name But like she did I was.

489
00:29:21,408 --> 00:29:24,100
Scott: I was watching an adventure time and randomly I hear her voice.

490
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,040
Scott: I'm like a single episode character.

491
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:29,934
Scott: Oh, I know what you're talking about, and I'm like oh, that's that's who that is and she.

492
00:29:30,356 --> 00:29:31,480
Scott: she always does the same exact voice.

493
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:32,811
Scott: I don't think she doesn't voice.

494
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:33,980
Scott: act to do different voices.

495
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,586
Scott: Yeah, just act acts with her own voice.

496
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,273
Rym: funny enough total random aside.

497
00:29:37,313 --> 00:29:41,714
Rym: I've been rewatching Star Trek Voyager, and Who cares it's a good Star Trek.

498
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:42,379
Scott: so okay?

499
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:49,067
Rym: The thing about Star Trek is they like most episodes love like one guest star just like they do a roll all right Cuz.

500
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:50,118
Scott: it's like our actual TV.

501
00:29:50,343 --> 00:29:50,529
Scott: Yeah.

502
00:29:51,143 --> 00:29:59,927
Rym: So there's one episode where there's this other Hologram of a doctor who's kind of weird and neurotic, and they just old thing and I remember thinking Kind of looks like a young Andy Dick.

503
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:00,489
Rym: all right.

504
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:00,951
Rym: That's funny.

505
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:02,617
Rym: Whatever probably it was it was.

506
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:03,320
Rym: it was literally.

507
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:04,624
Rym: It's just.

508
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:07,213
Rym: that was a long time ago that show was on TV.

509
00:30:07,534 --> 00:30:09,319
Rym: It literally was just a young Andy dick.

510
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,966
Rym: In the meta moment the GeekNights book club book which we will read at some point is so.

511
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:23,020
Scott: I've been getting bored on the train with the various games I have because most of the good games I have in my phone like need some kind of internet to be worth a shit.

512
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:29,640
Scott: And there's not enough if people out there make good games for mobile.

513
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:34,844
Scott: I don't need internet such right such as Narosha Mahakson race for the galaxy Which are both great.

514
00:30:34,884 --> 00:30:38,800
Scott: still if you haven't played those yeah, but at this point, but the point is I've played them both so much.

515
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,723
Scott: I need a new one.

516
00:30:39,743 --> 00:30:44,660
Rym: I can play an entire race for the galaxy between hunters point and Vernon Jackson, right?

517
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,366
Scott: It's like between.

518
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:52,996
Scott: so it's like I need a new Low mobile app of that caliber for gaming that I can play on the toilet or train.

519
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:56,828
Scott: and since I couldn't find one I was like all right.

520
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,100
Scott: I'm supposed to use the can read a book.

521
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,820
Scott: I was supposed to use the Kindle app on the train not the game apps.

522
00:31:03,222 --> 00:31:03,925
Scott: Oh, I forgot.

523
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:05,854
Scott: I've had that plan, and I forgot that plan.

524
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:07,441
Rym: should I actually start reading 2001?

525
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:11,535
Scott: I remember that plan and on the one subway ride from home to here just now.

526
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:12,679
Scott: I read like three chapters.

527
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:14,647
Rym: all right I'll start reading it to them tomorrow morning.

528
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:16,375
Scott: It's all about the monkeys.

529
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:17,379
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

530
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:18,864
Scott: So 2001 is space odd.

531
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:29,831
Scott: Also The monolith in the book is not black It's like a translucent crystal thing.

532
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:30,776
Rym: yeah, that makes sense.

533
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:34,284
Scott: anyway What else is meta?

534
00:31:34,585 --> 00:31:36,172
Rym: so what is so?

535
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:38,040
Rym: PAX East is coming the hell up.

536
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,410
Rym: We will be there doing at least one panel.

537
00:31:41,113 --> 00:31:42,117
Rym: It's a brand new one again.

538
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:42,760
Rym: We're on a roll.

539
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:49,120
Rym: Sometimes PAX is like even though we have a new panel They'll be like do the one you already did twice because people really like it.

540
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,806
Rym: But we've been on a roll of.

541
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:58,570
Rym: PAX has given us our brand new panel, so we've got Friday March 29th 3 30 p.m.. In the Cuttlefish theater.

542
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:01,860
Rym: We are doing the real harm of games.

543
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:04,508
Rym: It's gonna be a real talk panel right?

544
00:32:04,528 --> 00:32:07,818
Scott: so usually what happens is I come up with something weird happened.

545
00:32:07,978 --> 00:32:13,473
Scott: right usually I come with a thesis and then I Explore a research and get a whole bunch of supporting stuff.

546
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,920
Scott: Just like when I was writing papers in school.

547
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,472
Scott: Yep, right, so I was.

548
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:17,258
Scott: I had a thesis.

549
00:32:18,523 --> 00:32:20,258
Scott: Mostly I wanted to complain about gambling.

550
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:24,260
Scott: Yeah, children gambling and I was like I can't just do a panel on children gambling.

551
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:26,780
Scott: I have to do it or make it a broader thing.

552
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,100
Rym: Yeah, I have so many panels that are only like 20 minutes worth of material.

553
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,261
Rym: So

554
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:45,364
Scott: I started researching other harms of games besides children gambling and you know what a lot of the things I have to slightly change the thesis to be like look games are The

555
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:50,266
Rym: moral is gonna be along the lines of games have some harms But they're not the ones everyone thinks they are.

556
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:54,460
Scott: and here's the one thing that might actually for actually be a harm of games.

557
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,787
Scott: Let's not make this mistake.

558
00:32:55,827 --> 00:32:57,375
Scott: Let's keep games from being harmful.

559
00:32:57,516 --> 00:33:05,800
Scott: Yes Instead of I was the my original plan was going to be this is you know violence isn't a harm of games Sex isn't a harm of games.

560
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,744
Scott: But this is this isn't?

561
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:07,106
Scott: this isn't?

562
00:33:07,126 --> 00:33:07,488
Scott: this isn't?

563
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:07,869
Scott: this isn't.

564
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:10,139
Rym: so as children get it turns out there's probably only one.

565
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:13,049
Scott: Now my thesis is look at right.

566
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,694
Scott: They said violence was a harm.

567
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:15,396
Scott: They were wrong.

568
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:16,620
Scott: They said this is a harm.

569
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,060
Rym: They were wrong and D&D made me a Satanist, but there's nothing wrong with that.

570
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,087
Scott: This also this nope, not harmful.

571
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:23,030
Scott: this not harmful.

572
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,953
Scott: this not harmful.

573
00:33:24,113 --> 00:33:24,334
Scott: Yep.

574
00:33:24,434 --> 00:33:28,065
Scott: Games are super good and not harmful Except children gambling.

575
00:33:28,185 --> 00:33:28,366
Rym: Yep.

576
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:32,018
Rym: So let's fix that shit the exploitative nature of the industry that makes game.

577
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,268
Rym: Yes This will be a good panel.

578
00:33:34,328 --> 00:33:35,273
Rym: Yeah, so stay tuned.

579
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,358
Rym: you notice the other thing.

580
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:36,740
Rym: that's weird.

581
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,059
Rym: We're on a roll of doing panels that required a bunch of research.

582
00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:46,020
Scott: We I think we might have tied aid an amount of research to where I went one level deeper than Wikipedia.

583
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:52,220
Scott: Oh for like a number of minutes that had two digits in it Scott for a rare game mechanics.

584
00:33:52,381 --> 00:33:53,846
Rym: I was actually reading essays.

585
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:58,040
Scott: Oh, no, I read an article on psychology today, which is actually legit website.

586
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,439
Rym: I found an essay like a legit fucking essay talking about Rondell's.

587
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:04,687
Rym: It's actually really good.

588
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:06,800
Rym: I feel like I could turn that into a panel on its own.

589
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:08,987
Scott: I don't think your Rondell panel is gonna get accepted.

590
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:12,860
Rym: I if it PAX Unplugged might accept a panel.

591
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,860
Rym: That's literally just an hour of Rondell's.

592
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:23,438
Scott: maybe we should Rondell's and orthogonal adjacency and hexagonal grids anyway.

593
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:31,320
Rym: Anyway, we will be doing that at least that panel and otherwise we're just four days of PAX like go to PAX East.

594
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,107
Rym: It's real fun.

595
00:34:32,127 --> 00:34:32,833
Rym: Mm-hmm.

596
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:41,480
Rym: Beyond that This is actually the end of our long run of PAX's and then we actually have a break from PAX's before PAX West.

597
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:53,876
Scott: So spend your warm summer months if you're in the northern hemisphere enjoying bicycles or Playing video games cuz you're out of school or whatever or skiing because skiing is great in the summer.

598
00:34:54,317 --> 00:34:56,824
Scott: Well, it's not summer yet I'm talking about between PAX East and West.

599
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:01,200
Rym: this summer between PAX East and West there is still a little bit of skiing anyway.

600
00:35:01,704 --> 00:35:03,640
Rym: Early April skiing spring skiing is fine.

601
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:11,049
Scott: so today's episode is about laundry because I had an opening bit about laundry that I Decided to turn into the main bit.

602
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,020
Scott: So that way I'm gonna give you the opening bit right now.

603
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,856
Scott: So I was doing my laundry yesterday night yesterday.

604
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:17,177
Scott: Yeah.

605
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:21,054
Rym: Yes two days Laundry like I do in it like downstairs in your apartment building.

606
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:22,200
Scott: Yeah, I was doing it two days ago.

607
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:29,572
Scott: And you know, I was just reading the laundry instructions on various articles of clothing And I was reading the the tech.

608
00:35:29,632 --> 00:35:33,509
Scott: I realized, you know I just I was reading on things that didn't know how to wash.

609
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:35,336
Scott: right to like this would be delicate.

610
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:36,380
Scott: or can I dry this?

611
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,246
Scott: No dryer.

612
00:35:37,327 --> 00:35:38,114
Scott: I try to make a decision.

613
00:35:38,175 --> 00:35:38,538
Scott: I've done that.

614
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,520
Rym: I have some weird articles of clothing that actually had surprising instructions.

615
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:43,104
Rym: I did not.

616
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,360
Rym: I had I not read that label out of ruin them.

617
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,860
Scott: So I just I looked at the tag on some jeans, which I'd never looked at the tag on.

618
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,172
Rym: So I'm gonna guess cuz jeans usually say modern jeans.

619
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:56,800
Rym: wash inside out machine wash cold God line dry do not tumble.

620
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,991
Scott: Yeah It was that first part the inside out inside out Scott never in my hands.

621
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:04,180
Rym: inside out is like the secret to happiness.

622
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:05,458
Rym: I didn't know this.

623
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:08,509
Scott: I've got 36 years of life doing laundry.

624
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:15,840
Scott: for half those years at least more than half right and Never have I washed the pants inside out on purpose.

625
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:17,800
Rym: Logically, I figured this out as a kid.

626
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,116
Rym: I've always washed them inside out and here's why reason number even before labels would say it.

627
00:36:22,177 --> 00:36:25,168
Rym: reason number one The stinky bits are on the inside.

628
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:26,593
Scott: I don't stink.

629
00:36:26,914 --> 00:36:28,460
Rym: Well, sometimes you might stink.

630
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:35,780
Scott: Yeah, if if you don't wash your jeans my clothes get dirtier on the outside where dirty things in the world touch my clothes.

631
00:36:35,981 --> 00:36:38,489
Rym: But there is sweat like filth of New York.

632
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,914
Scott: Yeah filth of New York.

633
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:41,660
Scott: Here's the thing dirt from the street.

634
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:43,246
Scott: So one hobo pee.

635
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:46,240
Rym: sweats will come in from the inside not the outside.

636
00:36:46,341 --> 00:36:48,460
Rym: So if you want to tear it inside out, you're gonna wash the sweat out.

637
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,523
Rym: Don't have that.

638
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:56,249
Rym: other pieces of clothing and buttons and shit and the sides of your dryer and the agitator are gonna Scuff up your pants over time.

639
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:56,932
Scott: I don't care about that.

640
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:58,017
Rym: if they're inside out.

641
00:36:58,037 --> 00:36:58,500
Rym: They'll scuff up.

642
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,500
Rym: I never had that problem, but that's the reason you wash them inside out.

643
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:03,165
Scott: No The reason I wash them inside out.

644
00:37:03,185 --> 00:37:10,153
Scott: see when I used to wash jeans not inside out until this week You think this now.

645
00:37:10,213 --> 00:37:12,417
Scott: well, you might not know this because you've never washed them out.

646
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,300
Scott: you I guess you always knew to be inside.

647
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,210
Rym: I've never washed my jeans outside in in my time.

648
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:24,194
Scott: when you wash jeans not inside out What happens is they actually come out of the dryer right kind of stiff.

649
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:25,859
Rym: Well, you never put your jeans in the dryer.

650
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:26,542
Scott: Yeah, I do.

651
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:27,888
Scott: No, you shouldn't why not?

652
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:29,133
Rym: Where's the mouth faster?

653
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:29,896
Scott: They're fine.

654
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:30,780
Scott: I never had that problem.

655
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,047
Rym: I never put my jeans in the.

656
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:34,360
Scott: well, so we'll talk about dryer in a second.

657
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,553
Rym: But first have my jeans look like jeans, but they're actually just spandex.

658
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:41,217
Rym: So I can't put them in the dryer.

659
00:37:41,337 --> 00:37:48,773
Scott: Anyway, so they come out all stiff and The pockets on the inside of the jeans still wet.

660
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:49,857
Scott: No, they're not.

661
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:50,520
Scott: they're not wet.

662
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:51,344
Rym: No, they'll be.

663
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:52,209
Rym: we're just there.

664
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,839
Rym: if you watch humble dry low, they'll be.

665
00:37:53,879 --> 00:38:01,039
Scott: well No, they're all bunched up and like when you put them on the for the first time They're all like it and you have to write.

666
00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:03,578
Scott: I've never experienced that cuz you never watched inside.

667
00:38:04,102 --> 00:38:06,420
Scott: But now I soon I'm like, oh it says inside out.

668
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,610
Scott: So I put them all inside out just to see if there's a difference.

669
00:38:09,072 --> 00:38:21,020
Scott: and when I took them out of the dryer They were all smooth and the pockets were straight looking like I had just bought these jeans at the store five minutes ago And I was like, whoa, I guess I've never put in jeans not inside out ever again.

670
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:23,228
Rym: So here's an important nuance to that.

671
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:26,319
Rym: if we're talking about laundry because this laundry we're just gonna stream of consciousness.

672
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:28,532
Scott: this So well, let's talk about the dryer.

673
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:29,800
Rym: Oh, yeah, so well, we'll get to the dryer.

674
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,223
Rym: What you should and should not put in there There are three.

675
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:35,556
Rym: there are three effective kinds of genes in the modern world when when we're isn't like.

676
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:43,896
Rym: when I was in middle school There was as far as I knew there's only one kind of jeans Heavy ass denim jeans that you can put in the dryer that are invincible and lasts forever.

677
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:45,180
Scott: That mean that's yeah.

678
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:49,935
Rym: So nowadays I have a couple pairs of jeans that are like that like old super heavy denim.

679
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:52,676
Rym: They're the same jeans I've had since middle school.

680
00:38:54,002 --> 00:38:56,360
Rym: Okay, there's the exact same jeans unchanged.

681
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:05,100
Rym: Most of my jeans now are Fashion jeans that are not that durable and they look like jeans and they're fashionable and they're tight and they're comfortable.

682
00:39:05,725 --> 00:39:10,310
Rym: but if I like Crawl around in my knees working on stuff.

683
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:12,800
Rym: It'll just ruin them where old jeans are invincible to that.

684
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:16,034
Rym: And these jeans do not work well in dryers.

685
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,582
Rym: So they're all like line dry Mmm.

686
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:24,879
Rym: These are denim interwoven with spandex.

687
00:39:25,623 --> 00:39:27,733
Scott: Yeah, I have some of those but they're just fine in the dryer.

688
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:28,134
Rym: I didn't.

689
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:29,280
Rym: these do you put in the dryer?

690
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,822
Rym: They'll ruin them.

691
00:39:30,043 --> 00:39:31,109
Scott: No, they haven't been ruined yet.

692
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,155
Scott: I've been doing it for a long time.

693
00:39:32,175 --> 00:39:33,140
Rym: Have you had them years?

694
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,277
Rym: How often do you wear them?

695
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:37,430
Scott: You know and when it's cold, okay.

696
00:39:37,651 --> 00:39:39,719
Rym: Anyway, so should we talk about the dryer?

697
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:43,060
Scott: So the thing I learned actually from loot crane a burning wheel.

698
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:44,529
Scott: So I just want to point out.

699
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,080
Rym: me and Emily been telling you this for years.

700
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:52,523
Scott: You always ignored us and then randomly Luke crane says no one ever told me that you came back to us and said hey Guess what?

701
00:39:52,584 --> 00:39:53,026
Scott: I learned.

702
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:53,810
Scott: I have no memory.

703
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:59,384
Scott: Yes Anyway, no memory whatsoever Pointing this out.

704
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:01,754
Scott: So Luke crane was wearing a shirt from like.

705
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:07,136
Scott: it was like an old concert t-shirt But it looked like he had bought it the day before even though the concert was many years earlier.

706
00:40:07,478 --> 00:40:08,919
Scott: and I was like How's your shirt?

707
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:15,257
Scott: You know, yeah Does your printed nerdy t-shirt look like it's fucking brand new even though it's clearly not brand new?

708
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:17,570
Scott: and I've seen you wear it Before and he's like you.

709
00:40:17,611 --> 00:40:18,880
Scott: just don't put it in the dryer, right?

710
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,660
Scott: So any t-shirt like a nerdy t-shirt that is stuff printed on it if you want to.

711
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:36,872
Scott: I got bit in pristine like a concert t-shirt or a PAX t-shirt or a t-shirt you bought for fan gamer calm or the Yeti Screen printed in the old way like the thick way Yeah, but I mean pretty much any shirt with anything printed on it.

712
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:38,700
Scott: period your favorite webcomic.

713
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,093
Scott: You bought a t-shirt from to pay to go.

714
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:40,799
Scott: whatever it is.

715
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,120
Rym: It depends on this on the process because there are some modern methods of printing.

716
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:45,811
Rym: Don't suffer from the point.

717
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:56,675
Scott: is all those t-shirts right that you if you want to keep them in a plus condition and not have the print get all cracked or break apart or Fade away or generally get ruined wash them cold.

718
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:57,760
Scott: I was already doing that.

719
00:40:57,925 --> 00:41:00,881
Scott: Yeah Don't put them in the dryer at All.

720
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:09,690
Scott: the dryer will even if it won't melt the the printing like immediately like you put in the dryer once you come this out It's like oh, it's fun It's a little crease it a few times and weaken it right.

721
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,203
Scott: be like if you put in the dryer just like one time you Notice any problems at all.

722
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:13,725
Scott: look perfect.

723
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:25,353
Scott: two times you won't notice, but over time so gradually that it escapes your notice It will start to fall apart and not be in good condition anymore And you won't realize it was because of the dryer because it's not like you.

724
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:27,804
Scott: put it in the dryer and take it out and suddenly It's messed up Scott.

725
00:41:27,824 --> 00:41:28,488
Rym: I'm gonna blow your mind.

726
00:41:28,508 --> 00:41:29,412
Rym: There's a third thing you need.

727
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:30,920
Scott: you hang that shit to dry.

728
00:41:31,582 --> 00:41:33,200
Scott: I'm like a some sort of drying.

729
00:41:33,382 --> 00:41:35,160
Scott: You know if you have the drawing rack hang it straight.

730
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:36,006
Scott: I haven't a rack.

731
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:38,100
Scott: or if you had the string out behind your house the clothesline.

732
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:42,079
Rym: So there's a third piece that I feel like you should have been able to infer.

733
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:47,115
Rym: When you put it in the washer, especially if you have a top loader that has an agitator.

734
00:41:47,697 --> 00:41:48,640
Rym: put it in inside out.

735
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,607
Scott: It's inside out.

736
00:41:49,627 --> 00:41:50,654
Scott: I said it doesn't really matter.

737
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,017
Scott: It does.

738
00:41:51,037 --> 00:41:55,531
Rym: well It does if it's thick screen printing hmm if it's like.

739
00:41:55,571 --> 00:42:04,004
Rym: if it's like the more die style as opposed to the thick paint style That's not a concern, but if it's the thick style like the mosey shirt if you don't wash it inside out It'll cut.

740
00:42:04,044 --> 00:42:05,395
Rym: that's what causes that cracking.

741
00:42:05,415 --> 00:42:10,580
Scott: well I haven't had a problem since I learned to go without the dryer on those.

742
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,467
Rym: Let's talk about the dryer.

743
00:42:11,507 --> 00:42:14,944
Rym: because one thing I did Draw a lot of countries.

744
00:42:14,984 --> 00:42:20,359
Scott: people seem to not use dryers and well usually hot places and dry places You don't need dryers.

745
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:26,025
Rym: But I saw my whole life having to wash her in a dryer and basically my use of the dryer is Towels cheats.

746
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,254
Rym: you put them in the dryer on high.

747
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:32,177
Rym: yeah Gotta make sure that you put them in the dryer to kill all the mildew.

748
00:42:32,197 --> 00:42:33,221
Rym: mm-hmm Cuz.

749
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:34,185
Rym: you get fabric ones.

750
00:42:34,225 --> 00:42:38,159
Rym: if you're good don't get those like nasty plastic ones the weird smell.

751
00:42:39,873 --> 00:42:47,078
Rym: and Clothes you don't care about like shitty socks old like proper denim jeans that are invincible anything.

752
00:42:47,118 --> 00:42:54,271
Rym: I wear to sleep underwear like Shirts that I'm gonna wear out work clothes anything like that.

753
00:42:54,532 --> 00:43:02,019
Rym: the things I don't feel like like a collared shirt that can go in The drain yep, or shirts that are old enough to where I don't care or like a plain old pant like a pant.

754
00:43:02,723 --> 00:43:12,422
Rym: So I did the thing a long time ago Not a long time ago like about a year ago where I I declared bankruptcy on my socks And I decided that I will only have Like.

755
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:17,829
Rym: I'll get one type of sock that I like and get a ton of pair of that exact sock Mm-hmm and no other socks.

756
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,755
Rym: all the weird socks go.

757
00:43:18,775 --> 00:43:19,500
Scott: put socks in the dryer.

758
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,832
Rym: Uh I put my regular as black socks in the dryer.

759
00:43:24,273 --> 00:43:26,480
Rym: I do not put my smart wool socks in the dryer.

760
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,248
Scott: No, no, that's I put some more socks in here.

761
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:28,992
Scott: I think it'll ruin them.

762
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,238
Rym: It wears them out way fast.

763
00:43:30,258 --> 00:43:31,424
Rym: They're fine They'll wear.

764
00:43:31,585 --> 00:43:32,389
Scott: they've lasted years.

765
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,500
Rym: Yeah years mine will last the rest of my life.

766
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:36,488
Rym: Okay, is my plan also minor?

767
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:39,220
Scott: people socks not smart wool brand, but it's basically the same.

768
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:44,003
Rym: Yeah, well so the thing is I I have to kind of this extra usage in that I have a lot of smart Well socks.

769
00:43:44,023 --> 00:43:45,818
Rym: they wear every day like at work because they're really comfy.

770
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:54,270
Rym: But I also have a bunch of like fancy sport socks to use for like Running long distances and things that like special ski socks.

771
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:57,400
Rym: those all get hung up to dry because they're really expensive.

772
00:43:57,641 --> 00:44:01,440
Rym: Hmm like I don't want to buy ski socks more than a few times in my life.

773
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:10,079
Scott: Yeah When it comes to like something that is a delicate item some of them I look at the label and I look at like my Circumstance like am I in a hurry right now?

774
00:44:10,702 --> 00:44:13,339
Scott: How much space do I have in my drying rack right now?

775
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:19,017
Scott: And it's like sometimes I'll put some things tumble dry low if it says they can tumble dry low.

776
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:26,340
Scott: Yep, right like Like if I got a hoodie, right if I'm washing the hoodie, I'm usually gonna want to hang up the hoodie.

777
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,507
Scott: I don't want to put that in the dryer.

778
00:44:27,627 --> 00:44:29,840
Scott: Yep, but hoodies do take a long time to dry.

779
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:32,850
Scott: Yeah, and it says you can tumble dry low.

780
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:33,973
Scott: So it's like I'll hang it up.

781
00:44:34,033 --> 00:44:38,485
Rym: if I can tumble dry it inside out Zip it up inside out.

782
00:44:38,526 --> 00:44:39,389
Rym: I'm not I'm not kidding.

783
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:40,092
Scott: It doesn't matter.

784
00:44:40,192 --> 00:44:40,674
Rym: It matters.

785
00:44:40,694 --> 00:44:41,557
Rym: It doesn't in the dryer.

786
00:44:41,758 --> 00:44:44,887
Scott: The point is Tumble dry low is the option for some.

787
00:44:44,907 --> 00:44:46,231
Scott: it's like the borderline between.

788
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:48,600
Scott: I could dry it, but I don't want.

789
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:57,668
Rym: Here's what I don't put in the dryer fancy expensive weird socks that have like wool and stuff in them Nerd shirts that I actually want to keep.

790
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:58,753
Rym: uh-huh nurtures.

791
00:44:58,793 --> 00:45:00,380
Rym: I don't give a shit about they just go in the dryer.

792
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,485
Rym: That's right.

793
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:04,900
Rym: and all my like technical fabric like sports nonsense.

794
00:45:05,141 --> 00:45:15,195
Scott: Yeah, if I got all my heat techs and my clothes my like that all Russian shirt the thing is most of those things are so like hydrophilic bobic.

795
00:45:16,101 --> 00:45:20,100
Scott: That like they're not even that wet when they come out of the wash like my microfiber towels.

796
00:45:20,702 --> 00:45:23,636
Rym: They dry within 30 seconds of me being done with them, right?

797
00:45:23,676 --> 00:45:24,640
Scott: So it's like in the air.

798
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,222
Scott: It's like they're.

799
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:34,190
Scott: they're all weird fabrics that don't like absorb water like cotton does and they don't come out like of the washer like a Sponge that's soaking full of water like a towel does.

800
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,140
Scott: so I can just hang those up and they'll be dry in like an hour.

801
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:39,380
Rym: No, I would why I would dry all my cotton stuff.

802
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,780
Rym: But actually as time goes on cotton kind of sucks for most uses.

803
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:44,829
Rym: So I've gotten rid of almost all my cotton.

804
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:46,677
Rym: like I don't really wear a lot of cotton anymore.

805
00:45:46,737 --> 00:45:48,846
Scott: t-shirts again That's it t-shirts.

806
00:45:49,127 --> 00:45:54,423
Rym: But even then most of my t-shirts are a cotton like rayon blend Or a cotton nylon.

807
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:58,435
Rym: like they're always a blend and I prefer to wear technical fabric so I can get away with it.

808
00:45:58,776 --> 00:45:59,017
Rym: Hmm.

809
00:45:59,879 --> 00:46:04,020
Rym: So Here's here's the thing I was thinking about in terms of anecdotes.

810
00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:20,840
Rym: one thing that bothered me a lot at RIT and it still bothers me because I encounter it kind of often is I encounter a Lot of people who don't understand how to do laundry and I observe people when I'm doing laundry Doing laundry or really badly and clearly ruining their clothes and not understanding.

811
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:27,225
Scott: Well, I think it may not necessarily not understanding but it could just be not caring not caring Especially at college.

812
00:46:27,305 --> 00:46:30,600
Scott: A lot of people are just like they just fucking throw everything in one washing machine.

813
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,604
Scott: No, it's like.

814
00:46:31,684 --> 00:46:32,668
Scott: it saves them money.

815
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:33,592
Scott: It works.

816
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:35,097
Scott: At least their clothes don't smell.

817
00:46:35,118 --> 00:46:42,595
Rym: but like Who were afraid to do laundry because they didn't know how and they took all their laundry home every.

818
00:46:42,615 --> 00:46:44,544
Scott: well, that's bad upbringing That's not.

819
00:46:44,604 --> 00:46:45,408
Scott: yeah, that's not.

820
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,172
Scott: no I had it.

821
00:46:46,253 --> 00:46:46,756
Scott: There's nothing.

822
00:46:46,796 --> 00:46:51,552
Scott: laundry specific Society problem that is not topic even in high school.

823
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:53,640
Rym: Like my family just did laundry in a big unit.

824
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,468
Rym: So I never really did my own laundry in high school.

825
00:46:55,528 --> 00:46:58,160
Rym: even I mean laundry just got done.

826
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,026
Scott: I didn't think yeah, I didn't do laundry.

827
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:05,699
Scott: that often when I was a kid and my you know, family did my you know My mother did the laundry for everybody.

828
00:47:07,862 --> 00:47:12,000
Scott: Thing is when I was moving away, I'm like, oh I guess I have to do my own laundry now.

829
00:47:12,301 --> 00:47:14,308
Scott: Hey mom, show me how to do laundry.

830
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:14,569
Scott: Wow.

831
00:47:14,871 --> 00:47:22,020
Scott: I mean when I went to cut when I went to RIT You know the first day I got there I said, all right, you showed me how to do laundry.

832
00:47:22,121 --> 00:47:23,047
Scott: I remember what you said.

833
00:47:23,067 --> 00:47:28,620
Scott: I did it once but I'm like Let's go to the laundry room just to look at it and you tell me which buttons to push.

834
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,757
Scott: Yeah, and it's just like oh, yeah use that one in that one I'm like, okay.

835
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:38,639
Rym: And then I knew how to do laundry at RIT the first time I did laundry when I like that and basically the first week We were there after anime club at our wag.

836
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:46,059
Rym: I went down into the tunnels and I went to do laundry and I just looked at the tag and all my clothes And I sorted them based on what the tag said.

837
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:49,492
Rym: Yeah, that was it.

838
00:47:49,774 --> 00:47:50,420
Rym: it works fine.

839
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:52,867
Scott: I mean we basically in our goddamn building.

840
00:47:52,907 --> 00:48:03,719
Rym: the point is we tried but in our goddamn building the building we live in now on two separate occasions and Possibly the same person started a fire in the dryer.

841
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:04,800
Scott: That's that's a problem.

842
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:09,216
Rym: That is weirdly common because people don't know the dumbest thing.

843
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:11,570
Scott: if we're talking about dumb things I've seen other people do.

844
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:18,025
Scott: I saw dumbest thing I've seen someone do in a laundry room is they were drying their clothes and They were putting in.

845
00:48:18,446 --> 00:48:19,710
Scott: you know, they have those dryer sheets.

846
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:20,352
Scott: I don't use those.

847
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:22,660
Scott: Yeah, but I mean they have a valid use sometimes.

848
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,415
Rym: Yeah, generally I would avoid those things.

849
00:48:24,475 --> 00:48:25,020
Scott: I don't use them.

850
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:25,402
Scott: I used to.

851
00:48:25,442 --> 00:48:27,792
Scott: I use them at the beginning cuz I thought like it was a necessity.

852
00:48:27,932 --> 00:48:30,366
Scott: but I've stopped a lot years and years ago, I stopped.

853
00:48:30,689 --> 00:48:38,910
Scott: but it's like When I did use them, I put one sheet in the dryer and that was all I did Right, and I guess it's supposed to reduce static or something.

854
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:39,773
Scott: Yep, theoretically.

855
00:48:39,893 --> 00:48:40,435
Scott: Maybe it works.

856
00:48:40,475 --> 00:48:41,760
Scott: Maybe it doesn't have a static problem.

857
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,086
Scott: So I guess I don't need them right?

858
00:48:43,106 --> 00:48:45,880
Rym: Yeah, I saw someone ram sticks around ever, right?

859
00:48:46,062 --> 00:48:47,680
Scott: I saw somebody doing laundry.

860
00:48:47,921 --> 00:48:52,760
Scott: They open up the dryer and they were putting in like tons and tons of dryer sheets.

861
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:53,844
Rym: Oh and one.

862
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:54,646
Scott: what it was like.

863
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:58,078
Scott: they put in like maybe 20 sheets for like one dry.

864
00:48:58,199 --> 00:48:59,866
Scott: and I'm like What the fuck are you doing?

865
00:48:59,987 --> 00:49:06,360
Rym: I watched someone in colony at RIT I remember this moment Chris with with crystal alacrity.

866
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:12,814
Rym: So I'm like doing my laundry and I hated doing laundry Like I tried to minimize the number of times I do.

867
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:14,120
Rym: what is that fucking laundromat?

868
00:49:14,562 --> 00:49:24,780
Scott: Point that I think because of having to use pay laundry I tend to build up a big old pile and then do it Whereas if I had my own machine like in my apartment or house.

869
00:49:24,901 --> 00:49:25,587
Rym: I just do one load.

870
00:49:25,607 --> 00:49:29,999
Scott: I would be doing it like, you know As soon as I had enough to fill the washing machine, I would do it.

871
00:49:30,381 --> 00:49:30,822
Rym: So I was.

872
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:37,345
Rym: I was over there like doing an infinite amount of laundry because I had waited until I literally had nothing left to Wear exactly.

873
00:49:37,445 --> 00:49:46,440
Rym: I was wearing the loincloth boxers on that day Under some jeans that were dirty that I wanted to wash but I didn't have anything else to wear to go to the laundromat.

874
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:47,747
Rym: Yeah, they weren't getting washed.

875
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:58,988
Rym: Yep, and while I was there I saw someone Basically take a like two cup like kitchen measuring cup pour Completely fill it with detergent.

876
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,280
Rym: Oh, no pour it into the top of the washer.

877
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,146
Rym: No, so I was.

878
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,933
Rym: I was thinking I should stop them.

879
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:06,920
Rym: They were already too far into the process.

880
00:50:07,724 --> 00:50:10,440
Rym: I just decided to ignore that bubble flood.

881
00:50:11,012 --> 00:50:18,458
Rym: So yeah I Came back to get my clothes out of the dryer and I see that person is now sitting standing there in a panic.

882
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:23,119
Rym: the water There are suds Covering the floor of the entire laundromat.

883
00:50:23,328 --> 00:50:23,499
Scott: Yep.

884
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:29,460
Rym: And that person is standing there like trying to figure out how to get their clothes and sneak away before they get in trouble.

885
00:50:29,641 --> 00:50:30,002
Scott: So I don't.

886
00:50:30,102 --> 00:50:32,931
Scott: I don't entirely blame that moron for their that mistake.

887
00:50:33,052 --> 00:50:35,480
Scott: I also blame the laundry detergent industry, right?

888
00:50:35,861 --> 00:50:37,186
Scott: You buy laundry detergent.

889
00:50:37,507 --> 00:50:40,819
Scott: I buy that the yellow one that the arvin hammer one with no smells on it.

890
00:50:43,101 --> 00:50:47,097
Scott: That's what I've used my whole life and I a few times and I've used other things.

891
00:50:47,137 --> 00:50:49,464
Scott: I think I got a rash So I always use that same one.

892
00:50:49,484 --> 00:50:51,931
Scott: Yep, but basically it comes on.

893
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,460
Scott: the cup is a lid to the bottle the jug.

894
00:50:55,883 --> 00:50:57,072
Scott: That is also a measuring cup.

895
00:50:57,132 --> 00:50:57,918
Scott: It's super convenient.

896
00:50:57,938 --> 00:51:13,853
Scott: and Inside that cup there's like if you just look at it It's like a ring and I got you know Like a darker ring where like the screw part is and like you sort of feel like your OCD wants to fill up to that Line, right and it sort of like feels like the right amount for that cup.

897
00:51:14,354 --> 00:51:23,258
Scott: But actually if you look in the cup There's like these very hard to see Measurements right and they're labeled a one two, three, maybe even four.

898
00:51:23,298 --> 00:51:25,625
Scott: I forget I only ever use a or one.

899
00:51:25,645 --> 00:51:29,495
Scott: I use one if I like completely jam-packed.

900
00:51:29,655 --> 00:51:31,500
Scott: the whole washing machine full of towels.

901
00:51:31,942 --> 00:51:35,460
Scott: It's like full and I use a pretty much for everything else.

902
00:51:35,681 --> 00:51:39,760
Rym: We use concentrated and is a big like a teaspoon in this one load.

903
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,488
Scott: Yeah, it's like there's a big sign in the laundry room.

904
00:51:42,528 --> 00:51:44,153
Scott: That's like use a quarter cup.

905
00:51:44,314 --> 00:51:45,016
Scott: Oh my god.

906
00:51:45,357 --> 00:51:48,985
Scott: I'm using less than that Laundry detergent like take some of it.

907
00:51:49,025 --> 00:51:49,787
Scott: It's just like soap.

908
00:51:50,048 --> 00:51:52,475
Scott: It's like whatever and like mix it with water.

909
00:51:52,495 --> 00:51:56,384
Scott: It goes bananas Like crazy.

910
00:51:56,404 --> 00:52:01,600
Rym: part of this is that top loaders need more detergent and are way less good at washing.

911
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,910
Scott: Oh, yeah, I get side loaders.

912
00:52:03,031 --> 00:52:04,120
Rym: top loaders are the worst.

913
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,986
Scott: I've only actually ever used side loaders.

914
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:09,760
Rym: top loaders are mostly only common in the American Midwest and they're bullshit.

915
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:15,604
Scott: like In my house growing up the dryer was a side loader But the washer was a top loader.

916
00:52:15,664 --> 00:52:16,768
Rym: uploaders are just ass.

917
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:19,055
Scott: but it's like ever since I left home.

918
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:20,380
Scott: I've only ever used a side load.

919
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:29,920
Rym: Some side loaders use less energy clean your clothes better damage your clothes less and require less detergent to clean the clothes.

920
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:39,502
Rym: so a lot of people are used to When they lived in their house with their parents the old top loader that actually needed a lot of detergent and kind of sucked at Washing your clothes.

921
00:52:39,703 --> 00:52:43,694
Rym: Hmm modern washers need like a tenth that amount of detergent.

922
00:52:43,714 --> 00:52:45,579
Scott: But anyway, it's like yeah, you don't need that much.

923
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:52,520
Scott: and Rym see we were talking about detergent before the show we use super concentrated like a teaspoon in.

924
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:57,360
Scott: Yeah, Rym is using not only the super concentrated stuff, which is fine using like a bunch of different things.

925
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,196
Scott: I just use one thing one detergent to clean absolutely every clothing in the universe.

926
00:53:02,256 --> 00:53:03,520
Rym: We have two kinds of wash it.

927
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:10,080
Rym: Well, we have normal clothes to wash and we have weird sports clothes that get stinky and need to be washed differently.

928
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,290
Rym: Sports clothes are hard to wash for reasons.

929
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,474
Rym: I don't want to get into.

930
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:17,270
Scott: I have weird sport clothes for biking And I wash it with the same shit.

931
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:20,940
Scott: I don't put it in the dryer But I just wash it with the same stuff and it's just fine.

932
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:25,034
Rym: This is like the compression shirt that I wear running where I make.

933
00:53:25,195 --> 00:53:29,500
Rym: I make one of these stinky and dirty I had almost every day because I run almost every day.

934
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:35,884
Scott: I have like a base layer II shirt for biking when it's cold and I always I just wash that with regular Detergent just fine.

935
00:53:36,065 --> 00:53:36,869
Rym: Yeah, what's it made out of?

936
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:37,512
Rym: What's the fabric?

937
00:53:37,693 --> 00:53:38,879
Scott: It's some kind of weird fancy.

938
00:53:40,726 --> 00:53:42,640
Scott: Anyway, I don't look I don't pay that much attention.

939
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,684
Scott: I just said shit.

940
00:53:43,744 --> 00:53:48,700
Scott: I have to bike when it's cold, and I really don't want to let me buy every possible thing That will keep me warm.

941
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:52,560
Rym: These are I have gym clothes that every time I use them I drench them in sweat.

942
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,980
Rym: So they need to be washed and technical fabrics are hard to wash.

943
00:53:56,241 --> 00:54:00,114
Rym: So we use a different detergent and some borax for that because borax just makes laundry.

944
00:54:00,214 --> 00:54:00,455
Rym: Awesome.

945
00:54:00,495 --> 00:54:01,740
Scott: It just borax is good for Play-doh.

946
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,144
Scott: That's a borax is great.

947
00:54:03,164 --> 00:54:07,015
Rym: Just dump some borax in with your detergent and it'll wash your clothes way better.

948
00:54:07,437 --> 00:54:10,289
Rym: borax also costs Basically nothing.

949
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,660
Scott: it's like free like on Amazon.

950
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:15,755
Scott: It's like when you're going to buy baking soda and it's like oh, how much is this baking soda?

951
00:54:15,775 --> 00:54:16,759
Scott: It's like 30 cents.

952
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,885
Scott: It's like oh, okay.

953
00:54:19,025 --> 00:54:24,120
Rym: I bought a package of borax that will last us for years possibly and cut it cause nothing.

954
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:31,540
Scott: Yeah, it's like no matter how poor you are You can back if you're poor or certain things you can afford if you're legit poor and like really need to save money.

955
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:33,646
Rym: Use borax instead of detergent.

956
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:35,452
Rym: It'll wash your clothes pretty good.

957
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:38,080
Rym: Like it's it works and it cost nothing.

958
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:52,317
Scott: Not like expensive as tied like a lot other laundry detergents like are so expensive that like I was reading stories about like people using laundry detergent as like Currency, it's like buy drugs and other black market stuff.

959
00:54:52,418 --> 00:55:08,071
Scott: I believe it Is the same thing where it's like they would rob a drugstore steal detergent or formula because that was valuable stuff right and then buy drugs just instead of like Selling the formula and then getting money and then buying drugs.

960
00:55:08,112 --> 00:55:10,760
Scott: They would just give the formula to the drug dealer.

961
00:55:11,261 --> 00:55:14,630
Scott: Yeah, and it's like laundry detergent was also a very expensive item.

962
00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:15,673
Scott: So the fires.

963
00:55:16,255 --> 00:55:18,562
Rym: so one day the dryer fire one day We're just.

964
00:55:18,622 --> 00:55:22,000
Scott: I guess someone had a flammable clothing and put it in there and on high.

965
00:55:22,181 --> 00:55:24,150
Rym: So I'm not sure because there are.

966
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:27,688
Rym: there are three with there's three main ways Dryers will start a fire.

967
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:35,127
Scott: the main way not cleaning the lint room Yes is in a house there's someone in my apartment building who does not clean the lint trap because every time I Go to the dryer.

968
00:55:35,147 --> 00:55:36,539
Scott: I have to clean it up before I dry.

969
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:46,275
Scott: I was down there drying and like my neighbor was also down there washing after me and then I go and I go to the Dryer and cuz they were doing they were putting their wash in.

970
00:55:46,315 --> 00:55:47,140
Scott: I just took the wash out.

971
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:58,869
Scott: So I was going in the dryer and before I go in the dryer I take the lint wrap out and I go to clean it and she's like, ah, I guess you're not the person Someone who doesn't clean the fucking lint wrap.

972
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:01,260
Scott: and they were checking to see if it was me and it wasn't me.

973
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:05,419
Scott: And it wasn't them either because they're accusing me.

974
00:56:05,479 --> 00:56:07,612
Scott: they were Suspecting I might be the one and I wasn't.

975
00:56:07,672 --> 00:56:08,477
Rym: that narrows it down.

976
00:56:08,578 --> 00:56:09,423
Scott: It does It's not either.

977
00:56:09,443 --> 00:56:11,776
Scott: it's someone of the other 12 apartments in the building.

978
00:56:11,876 --> 00:56:12,580
Rym: good fucking god.

979
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,860
Rym: Do you know how many house fires that kill people are caused by lint traps not being cleaned out?

980
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,160
Rym: Yeah, every time people don't know the lint trap exists, right?

981
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,227
Scott: There's a lint thing in your dryer.

982
00:56:21,347 --> 00:56:24,699
Scott: every single dryer in the world has this every single kind before it.

983
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,061
Rym: Well,

984
00:56:25,323 --> 00:56:36,510
Scott: hopefully if you tell if you're the only one using it You don't have to do before only after right but before and after a public dryer you take it out You go to the trash and you put all the lint in the trash

985
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:36,951
Rym: because

986
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:38,757
Scott: lint is and then you put it back.

987
00:56:39,018 --> 00:56:39,922
Rym: lint from Modern.

988
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:45,102
Scott: your air conditioner has a filter like this pretty similar to clean that out like once or twice a year Yep.

989
00:56:45,543 --> 00:56:50,700
Rym: So also if you have a you know, if you have a stove, there's a little grease trap in the fume hood.

990
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,605
Rym: Change that periodically.

991
00:56:52,665 --> 00:56:53,408
Rym: Oh, yeah at the top.

992
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:53,869
Rym: Yeah.

993
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,957
Scott: Also your drip your dishwasher.

994
00:56:56,178 --> 00:57:00,557
Scott: some dishwashers I think most dish washes like a filter have like a thing at the bottom that you got to clean out.

995
00:57:00,577 --> 00:57:01,866
Scott: go to YouTube to Read about that.

996
00:57:02,068 --> 00:57:03,119
Scott: Yep watch about that.

997
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,580
Rym: But a huge number of fatal fires in the US are caused by people who literally don't know the lint trap exists.

998
00:57:08,841 --> 00:57:18,320
Scott: If you eventually start a follow if you follow New York Fire Department on Twitter They're always tweeting good fire safety tips Like know where the stairs are check the batteries and your smoke detector.

999
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:23,319
Scott: It is clean out your fucking lint trap in the dryer Flammable if you smell gas fucking run.

1000
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:33,113
Rym: So a corollary that the other thing that lint will cause a fire in is if you have a house The lit you probably have a tube the exhaust exhaust tube.

1001
00:57:33,735 --> 00:57:36,864
Rym: lint gets into that tube as well Yep And that tube will slowly.

1002
00:57:36,885 --> 00:57:42,392
Rym: if every now and then you got to take that tube down and clean it out someday that tubes just Gonna explode in a fireball.

1003
00:57:42,634 --> 00:57:42,755
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1004
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:45,328
Scott: So lint is super flammable.

1005
00:57:45,348 --> 00:57:52,633
Scott: If you want to start a fire like you're going camping bring some lint with you And then you can start your fire way easy with some lint way better than twigs.

1006
00:57:52,954 --> 00:57:55,041
Rym: I had a. I had an emergency fire starter Kit.

1007
00:57:55,102 --> 00:57:56,368
Rym: I put in a couple of ziplock bags.

1008
00:57:56,629 --> 00:58:03,824
Rym: It was a bunch of lint a bunch of basically, like wire foil and A 9-volt battery.

1009
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,269
Rym: Mm-hmm those three together.

1010
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:06,794
Rym: You can start a fire in any weather.

1011
00:58:06,815 --> 00:58:08,340
Scott: Yeah lint is like whoo.

1012
00:58:09,621 --> 00:58:12,972
Rym: So the second thing that starts fires is the other most common thing.

1013
00:58:13,414 --> 00:58:15,300
Rym: people are just dumb and they don't.

1014
00:58:16,123 --> 00:58:16,966
Rym: They don't connect.

1015
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:25,534
Rym: the action they took like I am putting this thing in a box That's gonna get hot for an hour with maybe this thing if it gets hot will be dangerous.

1016
00:58:25,554 --> 00:58:32,333
Rym: So they'll put like fake leather Clothes that have like rubber on it or flammable shit.

1017
00:58:32,353 --> 00:58:34,240
Scott: a lot of times that stuff will just melt and get ruined.

1018
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:38,659
Rym: But I'm not so often fired or it'll melt and ruin the dryer.

1019
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,245
Rym: Oh and the clothes another thing.

1020
00:58:40,265 --> 00:58:44,298
Scott: so I worked in a dry cleaner for like many years during high school, right?

1021
00:58:44,579 --> 00:58:48,865
Scott: And Basically, we didn't do any of the cleaning in the place I was working.

1022
00:58:48,885 --> 00:58:59,640
Scott: so I didn't get cancer from dry cleaning chemicals but people would give me clothes and they have to sort out their clothes and tag them and stuff so that we'd give the right person their Clothes back because everything goes in one giant washing thing, right?

1023
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,820
Scott: So one thing I had to do was check everyone's fucking pockets on everything to make sure you didn't leave anything in there.

1024
00:59:06,261 --> 00:59:16,460
Scott: Right, and I found a lot of pens that would have exploded with ink a lot of wallets full of money And a lot of other weird stuff that people left in their pocket before they did laundry.

1025
00:59:19,004 --> 00:59:23,900
Scott: That would have not been good if it got went into the washer and especially the dryer or the dry cleaning machine.

1026
00:59:24,041 --> 00:59:33,120
Scott: So now whenever I do laundry Basically as I'm sorting my laundry like into the different loads, I'm gonna do I always check the pockets on fucking everything?

1027
00:59:33,301 --> 00:59:38,620
Rym: Oh every now and then I miss something and then the laundry comes out and it's like oh there was a business card in those.

1028
00:59:39,507 --> 00:59:44,231
Scott: Never missed anything because I worked But I see it happen to other people.

1029
00:59:44,272 --> 00:59:44,573
Scott: I'll go.

1030
00:59:44,654 --> 00:59:49,240
Scott: when I open the dryer I'll see like a receipt that's all wadded up and was clearly washed and dry.

1031
00:59:49,361 --> 00:59:54,909
Rym: Yeah, basically, I'll see coins in there or sitting in that I was sitting in the apartment and Emily I we both kind of smell smoke.

1032
00:59:55,332 --> 01:00:00,360
Scott: Yeah, so I'm like well So we I walk around the apartment like see like I don't leave on the fire alarm, but I leave if I sell smoke.

1033
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,910
Rym: So it's definitely not coming from anything in the apartment.

1034
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:03,351
Rym: That's good.

1035
01:00:03,612 --> 01:00:05,440
Rym: So I got a hallway and it gets stronger.

1036
01:00:06,022 --> 01:00:11,420
Rym: Okay, so I go to the stairwell and I open it and it's like the stairwell is full of smoke.

1037
01:00:11,601 --> 01:00:18,280
Rym: Oh, so I'm like, well, we're either gonna stay in our bill We're gonna I'm gonna go barricade myself in my apartment because it's a fireproof building.

1038
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:19,360
Rym: Like I'm safe in the apartment.

1039
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:24,871
Rym: You can take the different the other stairwell or I'm just gonna leave the other side of the building other stairwell also filled with smoke Both stairwells.

1040
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:25,174
Scott: Yep.

1041
01:00:25,295 --> 01:00:33,332
Rym: Oh But so I hold my breath and I walk down the stairwell Just seeing because the alarm hasn't gone off anywhere.

1042
01:00:33,352 --> 01:00:45,028
Rym: and I get to the ground floor and I come out and I see a girl who looks like she's in her early 20s and The doorman and the girl is crying and saying just let me go in I didn't do anything wrong.

1043
01:00:45,088 --> 01:00:46,274
Rym: and the doorman just like nope.

1044
01:00:46,314 --> 01:00:47,259
Rym: You're staying right here.

1045
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:52,163
Rym: And this basically what happened was she put something in a dryer She shouldn't have.

1046
01:00:52,183 --> 01:00:56,840
Rym: yeah, she didn't know how to do laundry and she turned the dryer on high and it fucking caught on fire.

1047
01:00:57,081 --> 01:00:58,765
Scott: Yeah, I hope she's got renters insurance.

1048
01:00:58,945 --> 01:01:04,580
Rym: Yep, cuz she was responsible for like many thousands of dollars of damage to the laundry room.

1049
01:01:04,742 --> 01:01:05,557
Scott: Yeah, of course you are.

1050
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:14,260
Rym: She really wanted to go and get something out of the dryer So she wouldn't get in trouble and it was clearly not her fault because it was clearly her fault.

1051
01:01:15,561 --> 01:01:19,637
Rym: So the other thing this happened again, just cleaning clothes is suddenly so dangerous.

1052
01:01:19,998 --> 01:01:22,488
Scott: a few months I just cleaned some clothes back in the old day.

1053
01:01:22,508 --> 01:01:25,340
Scott: Just taking clothes get him wet in the river rub him on a board.

1054
01:01:25,822 --> 01:01:30,882
Rym: so a few months later this happened again starting fires and I Saw.

1055
01:01:30,942 --> 01:01:37,492
Rym: that's what I'm pretty sure is that same woman like in the room When they were like trying to sort out what started.

1056
01:01:37,512 --> 01:01:38,979
Rym: the small fire wasn't as big a fire.

1057
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:41,533
Rym: Pretty sure it was the same person who caused the problem.

1058
01:01:41,553 --> 01:01:42,819
Scott: Did you make the same mistake twice?

1059
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:51,286
Rym: So pull me one time after that by two time the laundry room put up all these signs that were basically like oh my god Don't fucking fuck up your laundry.

1060
01:01:51,346 --> 01:01:53,794
Rym: Jesus Christ - here's how to use a dryer.

1061
01:01:53,895 --> 01:01:59,999
Rym: Oh my god, so The third thing that will cause a fire in your dryer is something gasoline?

1062
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:03,729
Scott: Well, yes throw a battery in there if you're.

1063
01:02:04,231 --> 01:02:13,340
Rym: if your clothes are dirty with say Flammable oils because you were doing bike maintenance do not put them in the dryer unless they've been thoroughly washed.

1064
01:02:13,613 --> 01:02:17,012
Scott: Yeah Well, why would you put something in the dryer before you put it in the wash?

1065
01:02:17,032 --> 01:02:19,972
Rym: because it's wet because they got rained on And they're dumb.

1066
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:20,419
Scott: I don't know.

1067
01:02:20,604 --> 01:02:28,640
Scott: I guess yeah I guess if you were working on a car you got oily and then it rained and you're like Oh my clothes are wet and you just put it in the dryer immediately instead of going in the wash first.

1068
01:02:28,761 --> 01:02:37,627
Scott: Yeah, but yeah The washing detergents are really good at getting rid of oil like actually whenever I get all greasy from like You know messing with my bike chain or something like that.

1069
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,796
Scott: What I always use is Dawn dish soap.

1070
01:02:41,097 --> 01:02:42,059
Scott: then it's like whoosh.

1071
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:43,466
Scott: It's like oh man.

1072
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:46,080
Scott: So what laundry detergent similarly strong?

1073
01:02:46,482 --> 01:02:49,500
Scott: It's just even more concentrated than dish detergent.

1074
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,046
Scott: So I don't use that but I could.

1075
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:55,121
Rym: but there is a third thing that will cause fires in dryers that people don't know About.

1076
01:02:55,141 --> 01:02:59,103
Rym: I think I talked about it on GeekNights a while ago when I told the story of the fire because I was mad About it.

1077
01:02:59,284 --> 01:03:01,600
Scott: suddenly this is about dryer fires and not about laundry.

1078
01:03:01,961 --> 01:03:08,440
Rym: Well, the more if you have old jeans that have especially we had to talk about the different moods on the washing machine.

1079
01:03:08,622 --> 01:03:09,812
Rym: Oh, yeah, we can finish on that.

1080
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:10,579
Rym: you can end on that.

1081
01:03:10,981 --> 01:03:25,110
Rym: Anyway, if you got jeans that have a button fly don't wash your jeans on high and then let it sit for a while Because those buttons will be hot enough if the dryer isn't spinning to potentially ignite Some other piece of clothing that's touching them.

1082
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:25,693
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1083
01:03:25,974 --> 01:03:27,640
Rym: That is a way that you can start a fire.

1084
01:03:27,663 --> 01:03:29,726
Scott: Yeah I don't watch things with metal on high.

1085
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:33,700
Rym: you can avoid all of these problems by never putting anything but towels in on high.

1086
01:03:35,064 --> 01:03:37,151
Scott: Pretty much I do towels on high everything else.

1087
01:03:37,232 --> 01:03:38,817
Scott: medium, but also delicate things.

1088
01:03:38,978 --> 01:03:39,640
Scott: tumble dry loaf.

1089
01:03:39,901 --> 01:03:42,411
Rym: Yep, if you're gonna put a nerd shirt in lowest possible.

1090
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:44,760
Scott: Those are the dryer modes pretty much high medium low.

1091
01:03:44,881 --> 01:03:45,906
Scott: No other dryer mode matters.

1092
01:03:45,926 --> 01:03:47,475
Scott: You got a fancy dryer with other modes.

1093
01:03:47,656 --> 01:03:48,440
Scott: They basically don't matter.

1094
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:52,712
Rym: You only need high unless you get the drying rack dryer that doesn't tumble you literally.

1095
01:03:53,154 --> 01:03:53,916
Rym: I want one of these.

1096
01:03:54,217 --> 01:03:57,505
Rym: you hang your clothes on Hangers in this thing.

1097
01:03:57,545 --> 01:04:01,096
Rym: you close the doors and it just circulates air over them without tumbling.

1098
01:04:01,317 --> 01:04:03,948
Scott: to dry them without heat I just use the drying rack at that point.

1099
01:04:03,988 --> 01:04:04,993
Rym: That's a fancy dryer.

1100
01:04:05,013 --> 01:04:06,360
Rym: You only have if you have a fancy house.

1101
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:06,943
Scott: I guess so.

1102
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:10,420
Scott: But anyway, so the washing machine modes, right depends on what kind of washing machine.

1103
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:17,938
Scott: Yeah, there are a lot of washing machines a lot of different modes But the the main mode that people I think don't use correct because people I think people know it's like.

1104
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:29,994
Scott: yeah if it's like if it's like white and you don't care about the colors getting torn out of the clothes and you don't care about the Clothes like shrinking or something cuz they're a sweater Yeah, you can go hot towels hot will clean clothes better.

1105
01:04:30,135 --> 01:04:31,680
Scott: white undershirt times, right?

1106
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,038
Scott: White undershirt stuff like that.

1107
01:04:33,282 --> 01:04:41,645
Scott: You can go hot or warm if you want Right, if it's something that you don't want messed up like say your nerdy t-shirts that you're not gonna put in the dryer Normal wash but cold.

1108
01:04:42,107 --> 01:04:42,488
Scott: Yeah, you go.

1109
01:04:42,508 --> 01:04:50,192
Rym: Well, here's the thing normal washers like cheap ones or like sideloader industrial ones Like in our building, there's only three modes hot medium cold right.

1110
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:52,180
Rym: what that actually means is six modes.

1111
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:53,862
Rym: Well, yeah So what the minimum?

1112
01:04:53,883 --> 01:04:57,732
Rym: what it actually means hot means wash hot rinse cold.

1113
01:04:58,193 --> 01:05:00,299
Rym: medium warm means wash warm.

1114
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:00,840
Rym: rinse cold.

1115
01:05:01,121 --> 01:05:02,524
Rym: Cold means wash cold.

1116
01:05:02,585 --> 01:05:03,948
Rym: rinse cold because it fills with water.

1117
01:05:04,008 --> 01:05:06,315
Rym: drains fill the water again fancy dryers.

1118
01:05:06,515 --> 01:05:15,140
Scott: lets you set the wash and the dry Independently, so there's also something you got to check is in the back of a washing machine is not complicated.

1119
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,740
Scott: It's two hoses a hot water hose and a cold water hose.

1120
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:24,442
Scott: Yeah, a lot of washing machines are hooked up wrong because the washing machine don't know the washing machine doesn't know the temperature of the water It's.

1121
01:05:24,603 --> 01:05:36,054
Scott: it just says well if you tell me to use hot water I use hose a and if you tell me to use cold water I use hose B It's the hose.

1122
01:05:36,095 --> 01:05:36,399
Scott: a joke.

1123
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:39,100
Scott: But yeah.

1124
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,572
Scott: So a lot of times people put the wrong hose on the wrong thing.

1125
01:05:42,612 --> 01:05:45,282
Scott: and you tell your washer do cold does hot tells you Hot this cold.

1126
01:05:45,323 --> 01:05:46,267
Rym: No, this is extra bad.

1127
01:05:46,327 --> 01:05:51,509
Rym: So you say you tell your washer to walk do a hot wash It's gonna wash this closed cold.

1128
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:53,960
Scott: So you get none of the benefits of that hot rinsing.

1129
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,560
Rym: It's gonna hot rinse it which just ruins them for nothing.

1130
01:05:56,721 --> 01:05:59,352
Scott: But anyway, so other modes in the washer.

1131
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:00,939
Scott: you got to get this delicate mode.

1132
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,083
Scott: Which those only.

1133
01:06:02,183 --> 01:06:04,211
Scott: so those most use that for some sweater action.

1134
01:06:04,452 --> 01:06:12,618
Scott: those tend to only exist in either shitty Toploaders and what that means the ones the ones in my building have they have hot which I don't use.

1135
01:06:12,638 --> 01:06:13,380
Scott: Yeah, they have.

1136
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:14,722
Scott: Though they have.

1137
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:15,284
Scott: they've white.

1138
01:06:15,384 --> 01:06:15,986
Scott: white is hot.

1139
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:18,112
Scott: They've whites colors brights.

1140
01:06:18,252 --> 01:06:20,719
Scott: bright is cold, right color is warm.

1141
01:06:21,681 --> 01:06:22,484
Scott: White is hot.

1142
01:06:22,765 --> 01:06:26,760
Rym: I do not as I don't like washers that say like what the mode is for.

1143
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:28,166
Rym: I like what does this say?

1144
01:06:28,186 --> 01:06:29,049
Scott: There's like what they do.

1145
01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:31,560
Scott: There's a guide on the wall that tells you what the modes do.

1146
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:32,907
Rym: Yeah, but I need to know what it does.

1147
01:06:33,007 --> 01:06:35,400
Rym: I want to know like it's gonna tumble like this, right?

1148
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:41,220
Scott: So then it has delicates Woolen's which are far as I can tell are identical.

1149
01:06:42,162 --> 01:06:48,333
Scott: And then the final mode is the mode I think people use wrongly or don't know or scared of like don't use because they don't know.

1150
01:06:48,353 --> 01:06:50,118
Scott: what it means is permanent press.

1151
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:55,320
Rym: Ah Permanent press was a mode I use for most of my clothes back when I had a dryer that had that option, right?

1152
01:06:55,420 --> 01:07:01,416
Scott: So permanent press is basically this mode where there's like this like cold rinse at the end.

1153
01:07:01,456 --> 01:07:02,680
Scott: I don't know exactly how it works.

1154
01:07:03,745 --> 01:07:04,292
Scott: I'll be honest.

1155
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:04,798
Scott: I could go it.

1156
01:07:05,235 --> 01:07:16,316
Scott: Yeah The reason you use permanent press is basically to for a clothes that you would normally iron and you don't want it to be too Wrinkly, it washes them in such a way that they won't be too wrinkly.

1157
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:17,199
Scott: They won't right.

1158
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:21,058
Rym: So those are only relevant to top loaders with agitators.

1159
01:07:21,118 --> 01:07:23,576
Scott: No Loader as permanent.

1160
01:07:23,617 --> 01:07:24,542
Rym: Yes here's the problem.

1161
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:28,314
Rym: the differences between them are way less with the side loader because the.

1162
01:07:28,535 --> 01:07:33,580
Rym: the main reason there's so many extra modes in Top loader is that if the agitator spins it fucks up your clothes.

1163
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:41,864
Rym: Anyway, like I read right now on what permanent press cycle washes the clothes that wash and warm rinse cool not cold cool.

1164
01:07:42,485 --> 01:07:49,364
Rym: and the agitator is set to low and the spin cycle at the end that rings the water out is Also not that fast.

1165
01:07:49,605 --> 01:07:53,799
Rym: So the clothes get dried less in the washer because that last cycle.

1166
01:07:54,402 --> 01:07:56,027
Rym: I just I don't want to get into all this.

1167
01:07:56,067 --> 01:08:13,298
Rym: but basically the actual parameters you can set in a top loader are That's the heat of the wash the heat of the rinse whether or not there is a secondary rinse how fast the agitator spins or moves how fast the thing moves at the end when All the waters drain to ring the water out.

1168
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:18,279
Rym: Some modes will not do the ring at all because that'll mess up like a woollen for anyway.

1169
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:20,711
Scott: So permanent press is great for like dress shirts.

1170
01:08:20,832 --> 01:08:24,667
Rym: Yeah dress pants khaki pants Yeah, pretty much pants with the crease.

1171
01:08:24,707 --> 01:08:28,319
Scott: you put permanent press right anything that's gonna get wrinkled and you're gonna have to iron it.

1172
01:08:28,602 --> 01:08:31,058
Scott: Or you hopefully maybe want to try to avoid ironing.

1173
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,270
Scott: That's when you use the permanent press mode.

1174
01:08:33,712 --> 01:08:38,800
Scott: if you've got clothes like that Maybe save up enough of them to fill the whole washer and wash them all together.

1175
01:08:39,121 --> 01:08:44,782
Scott: So it's more economical and you don't want to like wash a bunch of jeans and then put in one dress shirt at its own Wash.

1176
01:08:45,144 --> 01:08:46,370
Rym: Oh, there's one more parameter.

1177
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:46,912
Rym: I forgot about.

1178
01:08:47,013 --> 01:08:48,460
Rym: it really only applies to top loaders.

1179
01:08:48,901 --> 01:08:51,812
Rym: How how full is the load like you only wash in one shirt?

1180
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:53,899
Rym: You'll fill the tank with less water.

1181
01:08:53,899 --> 01:08:57,340
Scott: Yeah, don't put too many clothes in either a washer or a dryer.

1182
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,223
Scott: They have a capacity.

1183
01:08:58,243 --> 01:09:00,934
Scott: It's only designed to clean so many clothes at once.

1184
01:09:00,953 --> 01:09:01,796
Rym: you put more in your stuff.

1185
01:09:01,817 --> 01:09:02,420
Rym: Just won't get clean.

1186
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:07,544
Scott: Yeah, it's like it cleans better when you put the right amount of clothes and you put too many clothes in it Can't clean all them.

1187
01:09:07,845 --> 01:09:12,825
Scott: They don't all really get clean, you know, if you put it too much stuff in the dryer It won't all get dry.

1188
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,932
Scott: Yeah, you got it right put in the right amount.

1189
01:09:14,971 --> 01:09:17,100
Scott: Don't put in some ridiculously tiny amount.

1190
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:21,460
