1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,472
Rym: It's Thursday August 1st 2019.

2
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:16,483
Rym: I'm Rym guy and this is the GeekNights' cheese episode.

3
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:17,445
Rym: I am pretty confident.

4
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:20,504
Rym: We have never talked about cheese as a topic.

5
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:23,006
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:28,809
Rym: In fact all I could find was a GeekNights' episode from a long time ago.

7
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:30,515
Rym: Where I'm.

8
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:50,090
Rym: the show node say something to the effect of Rym got ahold of some Christmas cheese And it's a link to a tweet and the tweet is just a picture I took on my phone of Emily standing somewhere holding in her hands like two pounds of wrapped Vermont cheddar With no other context no replies no thread no follow-up.

9
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:54,350
Rym: I have no way to know what this Christmas cheese is except to go listen to this old episode of GeekNights.

10
00:00:55,072 --> 00:01:04,549
Rym: Uh-huh, so I'm gonna link to that and I hope one of you will listen to this episode or maybe you're insane And you remember this old episode and you can tell me what the deal is with my Christmas cheese.

11
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:08,970
Scott: Yeah, I feel like you just deleted our cheese episode.

12
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:13,070
Rym: I mean it took you a while to get here, so that's definitely what I did.

13
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,115
Scott: Everybody's got no episode ideas.

14
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:19,210
Scott: he finds an old episode deletes it and then it's like oh, we never did a cheese show.

15
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:23,468
Scott: It's like someone out there has an archive of that cheese show.

16
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:26,114
Rym: yeah Well, we'll see.

17
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,090
Rym: so I got a bunch of travel you know, but I had my old job.

18
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,506
Rym: You may remember pretty often GeekNights should be derailed for a week or two at a time because I would just I had to.

19
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:38,510
Rym: And when I took the new job one of the nice things was as much as I enjoyed all that travel.

20
00:01:39,153 --> 00:01:42,929
Rym: It was nice to just not have to travel when I wasn't a hundred percent feeling it.

21
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:43,995
Scott: well I mean, that's the thing is like.

22
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:46,470
Scott: you know traveling going on vacation is like great.

23
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,839
Scott: Not a lot of people get to do it at all right.

24
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,470
Scott: most people like stuck where they are and can't move around too far.

25
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,447
Scott: Yeah in general regardless of whether they want to or not like if

26
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:57,870
Rym: you have a job That doesn't travel and your company like sends you to London for a week

27
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,319
Scott: But

28
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:02,399
Rym: Every month or in London well,

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,863
Scott: it's like if you keep going into the same place Then it's sort of like well, you're kind of living in a different place.

30
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:08,009
Scott: You're not really tourists in there.

31
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:16,233
Rym: Yeah, you're part-time living there Which is not as great like for all the time I spent in London this year or like it last year when Emily I went on a vacation there.

32
00:02:16,474 --> 00:02:20,689
Rym: It was the first time I'd ever been to London in my life as a tourist.

33
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:24,664
Scott: right It's like if you go somewhere, and you're not even if you don't do touristy things.

34
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:26,149
Scott: when you're a tourist you're smarter than that.

35
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:30,725
Scott: You're still having free time there where you can do whatever check out stuff during the day.

36
00:02:30,745 --> 00:02:35,759
Scott: if you're sent to a place to Work and they actually have a lot of work for you to do there And not a lot of bullshit

37
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:36,547
Rym: that you're working all

38
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:44,430
Scott: day Then it's just a fucking different office in a different time zone with it Maybe a different language or different accents or different food or something like that.

39
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,691
Scott: It's.

40
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:52,923
Scott: it's slightly novel maybe the first time because of the you know those kinds of differences But it's like the first few times just doing we're gonna dig in a different office.

41
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:53,204
Scott: it might.

42
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:54,630
Scott: it's as novel as it's almost.

43
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:57,390
Scott: It's not too different just working a different office across the street.

44
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:02,513
Rym: Yeah, well the first few times you do it though one thing That's fun is that you're in a place like when you get out of work You don't like.

45
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,176
Rym: what are you gonna do?

46
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:04,000
Rym: go back to the hotel?

47
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,506
Scott: right you go like check out the city But it depends how much time you got if you're working too much.

48
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:09,170
Scott: It's like okay.

49
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,688
Scott: Well, it's like I've worked eight hours in this other city And then I ate a dinner at a new restaurant and I went to it.

50
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:20,230
Scott: I checked one thing out, and then I went to bed because I got to work tomorrow in the same place.

51
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:34,506
Scott: You know it's like come on But if you're sent on business travel with lots of bullshit time like go to this conference give a talk and you're there for three Days yeah, it's like oh well Then I guess I'll be spending day two looking at the tempestries.

52
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:43,286
Rym: yep And or like a lot of my travel was not work all day It was you have to meet with these important people in this city go there for like n days.

53
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:53,450
Rym: and or like go to all These European cities and you have one meeting in each one of them And I didn't really have like work that had to be done during those trips other than those meetings and the follow-up to those meetings.

54
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,554
Scott: Yeah, so that's good travel.

55
00:03:54,875 --> 00:04:03,244
Rym: and more importantly like you got like do a trip to Paris and you're working the whole time But your work is go visit people like all over the city.

56
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:05,230
Rym: It's almost like a scavenger hunt.

57
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,730
Scott: Another thing that can happen is you know so there's the bullshit business travel where you don't get to do anything.

58
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,230
Rym: You've got a different office or the travel to the travel to a low tier American city.

59
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:23,209
Rym: If you're like we're gonna go traveling in the same country as me Yeah, like I've done business trips in the past where it's like go to Chicago for a week that sucks, right?

60
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,829
Scott: Business travel where you actually get to do to have time that's good.

61
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:38,990
Scott: But sometimes the business travel either has you away from home for a consecutively long time or even if it's not consecutive It's home back home back home back, and it's just the number of date.

62
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,310
Scott: You're not home enough, and it's like why I'm even paying for this home.

63
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:45,125
Scott: You know it's like even if I went on vacation.

64
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:46,190
Scott: just come vacation.

65
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:50,570
Scott: It's like if I went to the tropical island, and it wasn't my home, and I was there for like a month.

66
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:52,459
Scott: I'd be like this is too long.

67
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:53,242
Scott: I want to go home.

68
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:54,850
Scott: Yeah, my home was here.

69
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,866
Scott: That would be amazing, but it's not.

70
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:57,370
Scott: yeah.

71
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:57,752
Scott: It's like.

72
00:04:57,812 --> 00:05:01,710
Scott: you know you're not home sick necessarily like a child who misses their home.

73
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,950
Scott: It's just like you got shit at home.

74
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,994
Scott: You kind of want to do.

75
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,419
Scott: you don't want to be away too much.

76
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,290
Scott: you want to be home and away with the right proportions?

77
00:05:09,752 --> 00:05:11,421
Scott: Otherwise it's like I can't see my people.

78
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,069
Scott: I can't take care of my biz.

79
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:15,302
Rym: But now due to the nature of my job.

80
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:16,529
Scott: I don't got my stuff with me.

81
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,163
Scott: I need I want to use some of my stuff.

82
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:18,829
Scott: I don't got it.

83
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,050
Rym: So it looks like I'll be traveling again, but for a very different company, and that will see how that all goes.

84
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,183
Rym: But it's gonna be mostly London which I've spent so much time in London.

85
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:29,246
Rym: like I know.

86
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:34,084
Scott: I still don't understand what the modern Technologies of video conferencing and such and such like.

87
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:35,530
Scott: why is there this real?

88
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:44,010
Scott: There are cases where you need to send a person somewhere But like if you're just a business II person who talks and discusses and things like routine work.

89
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,615
Rym: There's no reason for that kind of try.

90
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:56,349
Scott: as opposed if you just meeting with people if you have a business if you're doing something Like I'm a Formula One engineer, and the race is in Germany I need to go to Germany to work on the car.

91
00:05:56,592 --> 00:06:03,040
Rym: It's also like saying a new team And you're gonna let you want to like meet the team in person and get to know them And then you don't really travel back there that often.

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,245
Scott: Yeah, maybe something like that.

93
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:05,712
Rym: That's the kind of travel I'm doing.

94
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:07,218
Rym: or like meeting clients or something.

95
00:06:07,238 --> 00:06:07,539
Rym: I'm not.

96
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,005
Rym: it's not like meeting clients.

97
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,290
Scott: I'll just meet you on the fucking phone.

98
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,880
Scott: Do you know what?

99
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:26,909
Rym: For whatever reason almost every interaction I've ever had in commercial like stuff over all these years meeting people in person just ends up being way more effective than using Utterly perfect video conferencing technology, and that's just how it is.

100
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:28,320
Scott: Oh, you're you're.

101
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:32,988
Scott: the damage to the environment I think outweighs the effectiveness of all the extra travel that's going up.

102
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:34,516
Rym: But do the nature of my job.

103
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:35,601
Rym: Not to mention the other costs.

104
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:37,591
Rym: I gotta do like carbon offsets and stuff Like.

105
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:41,890
Rym: I actually got this report of how much carbon I'm wasting by doing the strip and I gotta like offset it.

106
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,620
Rym: There's all this stuff.

107
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:45,780
Scott: Uh-huh Well, you could be eating lettuce then on the trip.

108
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,825
Rym: Yeah, but the problem is.

109
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:49,834
Rym: well, not the problem But I'm going to London, which whatever I like London like.

110
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:53,210
Rym: going to London for a week is always fun because I know a lot of people in London.

111
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,373
Rym: There's stuff to do in London.

112
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:56,620
Rym: It's like being in a slightly different, New York.

113
00:06:57,081 --> 00:07:04,701
Rym: People talk a little funny, but then I gotta go to Nothing against Frankfurt, but I've been to a lot of German cities and Frankfurt.

114
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:10,919
Rym: visiting Frankfurt is like that is the least German city I want to visit.

115
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,710
Scott: Are you gonna get some great Frankfurters though?

116
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:16,570
Scott: I like the best the original Frankfurt's known for having an airport.

117
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:18,478
Scott: I know that like.

118
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:21,050
Scott: that's what I know it for the airport and its name.

119
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:30,347
Rym: Yeah hot dog like if I had to rank German airport if I had to rank German cities that I've spent a lot of time in in terms Of how much I like them like Munich is number one.

120
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:30,790
Rym: by far.

121
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,315
Rym: Hamburg is like a close.

122
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:34,001
Rym: the Hamburg is like a distant second.

123
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:36,550
Rym: Berlin's like close like pretty close to Hamburg.

124
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,849
Rym: I think I like Hamburg more than Berlin, but I haven't spent a lot of time in Berlin.

125
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:50,470
Rym: list almost every other major German city and then Frankfurt at the bottom was just an Airport and a bunch of meetings that are within walking distance of said airport.

126
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:53,402
Scott: Oh, it's that the airport's like downtown the airport's like right there.

127
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:53,763
Rym: Wow.

128
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:54,547
Scott: That's pretty good.

129
00:07:54,848 --> 00:08:00,630
Rym: So yeah Sometime at basically after PAX there'll be a week of no GeekNights and then we'll be back to our regular schedule.

130
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,453
Scott: No, that's good for me.

131
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:02,879
Scott: I got free Rym goes on trips.

132
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,003
Scott: I got time to do shit.

133
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,549
Rym: Yeah, so you got any news.

134
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:07,444
Scott: Maybe I'll do shit related to my news.

135
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:15,710
Scott: So Ninja who I guess is still maybe like not if not the number one like one of the top video game streaming people on the Earth.

136
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:18,276
Scott: Yeah, and doesn't I mean, I don't know.

137
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:24,034
Scott: I guess he's still popular and he hasn't Fucked up majorly like some other streamers have.

138
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:25,440
Scott: he hasn't PewDiePie himself.

139
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:27,469
Scott: So I guess I'm not gonna call him.

140
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:28,413
Scott: I'm not gonna call him good.

141
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:29,196
Scott: But I know he isn't.

142
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:30,000
Scott: he's not evil?

143
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,005
Scott: I guess not yet.

144
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:34,119
Rym: We are we are reasonably is plus only watching.

145
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,344
Scott: then I've watched one ninja stream for five minutes and he was like, yeah a guy that the kids would like I guess Yeah Not someone I need like.

146
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:48,520
Rym: I'd watch his stuff and I can see like you're watching one of his dreams and you can imagine Exactly the kind of kid who's into that anyway.

147
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:53,680
Scott: So he has decided to move from twitch to exclusively mixers.

148
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,528
Scott: If you don't know mixer is another site.

149
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:56,893
Scott: maybe does what twitch?

150
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,500
Scott: does you stream yourself playing games?

151
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,211
Scott: But it's obviously much less popular than twitch much less.

152
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:02,672
Scott: Well known.

153
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:05,180
Scott: It's not owned by Amazon or some giant company?

154
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,441
Scott: I don't.

155
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:08,175
Scott: I think it's probably some startup that's losing money hand over fist.

156
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:10,852
Scott: I'm not sure about that I don't but that's what I guess.

157
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:11,839
Scott: it's probably correct.

158
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:21,560
Scott: But it has a ton of features that twitch doesn't have like built right in and plugins and I like share your controller like let Your listeners fuck with your controller, right?

159
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,898
Scott: you can do quizzes and all kinds of crazy interactive stuff with your audience.

160
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:29,960
Scott: and Whereas on twitch you would have to like do development work to get a lot of these features.

161
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:34,040
Scott: Yeah mixer makes it a lot easier and they provide a lot of them out of the box.

162
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,598
Scott: You don't get to do anything really other than use mixer now.

163
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:37,465
Rym: Mixer like.

164
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:47,261
Rym: I don't care about mixer at all yet But I'm glad it exists and it's getting some traction because it's forcing Twitch and YouTube to up their game a little bit Right.

165
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:48,625
Scott: So YouTube's competition.

166
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:59,058
Scott: YouTube shut down YouTube gaming which was really just a different UI for YouTube and a different home page That would filter out just gaming content Filter to just gaming content and they shut that.

167
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:02,767
Scott: dad You can still live stream on YouTube But I don't think a lot of people do really.

168
00:10:02,848 --> 00:10:08,120
Rym: what seems like most people do is they live stream a live stream on Twitch And then they put up the polished VOD on YouTube.

169
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:16,752
Scott: They and if they're a big streamer They have someone who edits for them like the the best clips of the day of their day-long Stream and makes YouTube videos out of them.

170
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:17,194
Scott: and they get.

171
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:18,400
Scott: they get to revenue streams.

172
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,600
Scott: Yeah, some people are and you follow them on YouTube some follow on Twitch some do both, whatever.

173
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,409
Scott: Apparently I was.

174
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:25,700
Scott: I wasn't fully aware of this.

175
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:34,978
Scott: I knew Facebook had live streaming right, but I figured it was mostly used for things For example, like, you know mayor press conference is usually streamed on Facebook.

176
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:38,085
Scott: Yeah Apparently that Facebook gaming booth.

177
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:39,009
Scott: It's always at PAX.

178
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,420
Scott: I thought that was about things like oculus because twitch owns oculus.

179
00:10:42,521 --> 00:10:44,197
Scott: I mean Facebook owns oculus, right?

180
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:56,109
Scott: and I thought it was about things like games you can play on Facebook or you know games that like link to Facebook or That Facebook developers are developing.

181
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:59,948
Rym: I thought that that's what that booth was about and you might say but room is God Aren't you journalists one?

182
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:00,593
Rym: No and two.

183
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:06,519
Scott: Anymore that's a booth that I walk past and glance and that's about it.

184
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:07,618
Scott: I know I'm useless.

185
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,353
Rym: I've been to a lot of PAX is if I look at a booth for more than a second that already means I am deeply Invested in whatever it is.

186
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:17,758
Scott: They got yeah So that booth apparently was actually about people who?

187
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,020
Scott: Use Facebook to stream themselves gaming instead of or in addition to twitch and I didn't realize anyone did that.

188
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,688
Scott: But apparently people do and have some number of viewers.

189
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:29,297
Scott: Facebook is like a competitor in that arena, I guess.

190
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:29,718
Scott: Yeah.

191
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:34,402
Rym: All right Yes, I guess I don't think the kinds of streams I watch would be popular I suppose.

192
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:36,589
Scott: but it seems like YouTube failed to compete with twitch.

193
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,520
Scott: Facebook is trying but I guess it hasn't succeeded.

194
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:45,520
Scott: But mixer actually seems to be doing better than YouTube or Facebook at least just by my feeling.

195
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:47,440
Rym: But it seems like it's competing with twitch.

196
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:54,436
Rym: I think it's just because of two simple factors one They added some features that twitch is probably just gonna also implement eventually.

197
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:58,046
Scott: and two Until now YouTube would be wise to get.

198
00:11:58,087 --> 00:12:08,394
Rym: until now most of the people I've seen moving to mixer seem to be people who aren't that popular and Going to a platform that's like kind of popular at least doing okay.

199
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:10,139
Rym: You'll be a much bigger fish.

200
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,011
Scott: That's I mean, that's always the dilemma here right?

201
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:17,417
Rym: is an ad gives you that algorithm boost.

202
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,484
Scott: you might think so But think about this, right?

203
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:22,860
Scott: Let's say you're uh, you know above zero on twitch, right?

204
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,346
Scott: You have a small following.

205
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:28,140
Scott: you go to mixer on mixer like you're on front page of mixer.

206
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:30,120
Scott: So literally everyone on mixer you're getting there.

207
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,359
Rym: I think you're better off getting front pages on mixer than having like under five thousand subscribers.

208
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,006
Scott: a lot of it depends on numbers.

209
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:42,599
Scott: first of all exact numbers, but also it's like That mixer pond is so small.

210
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,533
Scott: Are you real like you're not getting additional viewers because no one's on there button.

211
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:48,440
Scott: twitch for example, right?

212
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,354
Scott: I've been watching a lot of Mario maker streaming cuz it's.

213
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:52,037
Scott: it's really.

214
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:58,340
Scott: first of all If you want to watch a game streamed Mario maker is the best because it's always something different.

215
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,940
Scott: Yeah keeps changing constantly.

216
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:20,980
Scott: But also I found this Irish dude who's in second place for endless mode and he's just like this quiet cool Irish, dude Who just casually plays Mario maker 12 to 16 hours a day like that, but it's totally chill And he is in second place in endless mode Always trying to catch the crazy Spanish person in first place who apparently doesn't stream or at least you haven't found their stream.

217
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:24,180
Scott: We don't know who they are And his stream is totally Jill.

218
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:40,160
Scott: But I found him because what I did is I went to twitch and I clicked on Mario maker Which showed me all the Mario maker streams on twitch and I scrolled up and down and I looked at them all and I saw One that said like second place endless blah blah streak and I clicked on that one right on mixer.

219
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:42,528
Scott: There's a lot less people doing that.

220
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:47,386
Scott: so true if you are in like not on front page of twitch You're on middle page.

221
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:50,740
Scott: You might pick this just so much more people there.

222
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,308
Scott: You might pick up some.

223
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,007
Scott: you know, I guess what we would call it Street traffic.

224
00:13:56,288 --> 00:14:02,744
Rym: Yeah, it's hard to say though because discover traffic eyeballs Really low.

225
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:09,577
Rym: in this space you have to already be big to be big Right, so in this case ninja who's enormous?

226
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:13,835
Rym: well You say he's enormous, but this article actually says something specific.

227
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:18,192
Rym: He reportedly has 14,900 ish subscribers.

228
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:20,562
Rym: Okay down from his peak of 285,000 last year.

229
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:27,475
Rym: So that's an order of magnitude and if you look at twitch tracker, you see him.

230
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:28,900
Scott: He's all living off it.

231
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,920
Rym: Yeah, but you see him peak in a March of 2018 and just a constant steady decline.

232
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,100
Scott: Dove just since then like he's losing I mean a lot of the people were probably watching him when he was the hottest shit.

233
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:49,400
Scott: Right and like in those days when he was at his peak He was getting celebrities on there like fortnight was new but his number of active subscribers has dropped.

234
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,980
Scott: It's really to maintain that is just so, you know untenable, right?

235
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,980
Scott: You would have to constantly be like the hottest shit all the time constantly doing something new grabbing attention.

236
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:05,840
Scott: People get bored of watching the same guy do this, you know, yeah And the thing is it's like, okay people are getting bored.

237
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:11,180
Scott: I'm just keep doing what I'm doing So I mix it up and then you lose people who are into you for the thing you were doing.

238
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,386
Scott: Yeah, so you you can't really win isn't?

239
00:15:13,486 --> 00:15:19,783
Scott: it's unsustainable to just when your content is a person sitting there playing game Right.

240
00:15:19,823 --> 00:15:27,080
Scott: This is why you know, if you're a TV network, you can sustain by having new programming and new Yeah, there's more than one television show on a net, right?

241
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:40,549
Scott: You can do you doing things to like sustain constantly if you're if you're for if your entire network Hours and hours and hours a day is your face and a video game and you can't sustain the high counts They're gonna be fluctuations and variations.

242
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:41,332
Rym: Maybe I will say though.

243
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:44,785
Rym: This article says something that he's Still very large.

244
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:49,639
Scott: So moving to another platform his he has a significant portion of his following.

245
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,590
Scott: people Go to wherever he goes.

246
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,520
Scott: So once you're big enough, you don't need the platform anymore.

247
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:56,645
Scott: You have an audience.

248
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,560
Scott: you can go wherever you want to go and bring them with you.

249
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:05,662
Scott: I wonder if mixer paid him to go there to help them or if he's just going because of the features and it won't hurt Him to leave.

250
00:16:05,783 --> 00:16:10,440
Rym: or maybe he's going because if he's like he's losing popularity and he's trying to consolidate or make a movie.

251
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,280
Scott: I mean, you know, there are definitely people who if they left twitch would lose a ton right of their following.

252
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,680
Rym: Yeah, but this article also says something interesting.

253
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,720
Rym: It says that a lot of you basically says that mixer is also said to have a much more friendly community than twitch.

254
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:25,723
Scott: Smaller.

255
00:16:25,863 --> 00:16:27,567
Rym: yeah, that's a ridiculous thing to say.

256
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:34,587
Rym: all small platforms have better communities than big platforms except like a Chan and Gab and all those Nazi platforms.

257
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:38,800
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you know it gets big then it'll get worse.

258
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,547
Rym: Yeah It'll get just as bad as twitch.

259
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:43,500
Rym: twitch is not bad because of much of the design of twitch.

260
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,460
Rym: I can argue that twitch could design its plan its interactions to be less time.

261
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,364
Scott: It's just.

262
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:51,834
Scott: it's not even a social network or platform thing.

263
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:53,260
Scott: That's just a human society thing.

264
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,860
Rym: Way way back if you have a small there was live-streaming Scott and I did a live stream of GeekNights one night.

265
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:01,848
Rym: Remember that on what you stream?

266
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:04,520
Scott: Yeah, and there were like is you stream still exist?

267
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:05,079
Rym: I don't know.

268
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,550
Rym: There were like a dozen people watching because it was a live stream.

269
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,819
Rym: like people didn't have bandwidth to watch stuff like that back then.

270
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:16,520
Scott: So yeah, it's like we had you know Like ten of our listeners watching that one live stream and they had like ten was enough to hit the front page.

271
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:20,332
Rym: Halogen lamps on us cuz LEDs weren't really like like it was.

272
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:23,040
Rym: it was a long time ago really non HD webcam.

273
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:28,227
Rym: But for whatever reason you stream like about a third of the way through the stream Just put us on the front page.

274
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:29,854
Scott: cuz we had like ten people watching.

275
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:30,698
Scott: so then we had like 100 people.

276
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,925
Rym: Maybe we have many hundreds.

277
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:41,187
Rym: and then what happened was the chat filled with just garbo rage and bullshit and Racism and Nazi shit like instantly.

278
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:43,373
Scott: Yeah, not all kinds of just random typing.

279
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:45,480
Rym: Yeah, just random shit posting, right?

280
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,280
Scott: So like the guy I was saying the Irish guy playing Mario maker He's got tens of people watching him at any given moment.

281
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:56,756
Rym: The average number of viewer views per channel is 10 on mixer, right?

282
00:17:56,776 --> 00:18:04,160
Scott: But his twitch chat It's like you can talk in it, but you even someone who just has like hundreds or thousands of people in their twitch chat.

283
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:05,486
Scott: It's a useless twitch chat.

284
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:06,773
Scott: It's just a emoji flood.

285
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:07,778
Scott: It's useless.

286
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:11,408
Rym: Yep so speaking of following someone.

287
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:18,328
Rym: so I will not link to this story because I do not want to give this Probably questionable dude any Google juice, right?

288
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,836
Scott: So there was this dude that I had heard.

289
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:26,139
Scott: his name sounded familiar Colin Moriarty, so I had his name sounded like.

290
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:28,367
Scott: Basically when I heard the name I was like.

291
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,820
Scott: that reminds me of name of bad YouTube shouty, man.

292
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:33,810
Rym: So you look at his you his Twitter?

293
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,659
Rym: Yeah, he seems like a bad.

294
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:37,210
Scott: Nothing about him.

295
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:43,318
Rym: I couldn't pick him out of a lineup But his Twitter icon is like the Gadsden flag and his name is like no tax.

296
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,940
Rym: something Appears to be a bad person.

297
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:53,928
Scott: Anyway, so this person was on some sort of panel that was accepted at PAX West this year Which we have panels at surprise.

298
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:56,360
Scott: Yeah, and he got an acceptance email.

299
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:08,188
Rym: I think the panel was pretty much his podcast or the podcast He was on which fun fact panel packs asked us for like five years running to do a GeekNights panel And we refused because we didn't want to do anything.

300
00:19:08,228 --> 00:19:09,633
Scott: brandy in 2025.

301
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:11,740
Scott: We could do 20 years of GeekNights the panel.

302
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:15,800
Rym: Yeah, the listener it'll be a pride a luxury experience for you anyway.

303
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,136
Scott: But yeah, there was a panel that seems to be effectively their podcast the panel.

304
00:19:21,397 --> 00:19:24,568
Scott: It was accepted Before the schedule is not out yet.

305
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:25,753
Scott: There's no public.

306
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,780
Scott: but they did send out acceptance emails.

307
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:37,595
Scott: They sent them then another email that said sorry you're canceled But you're still getting free badges free special guest badges just like all the other panelists now

308
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,437
Rym: before we're taking

309
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:39,682
Scott: your panel off the schedule now

310
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:45,933
Rym: before we go on at Professional conferences at fan conferences like that happens all the time that

311
00:19:45,993 --> 00:19:48,680
Scott: it happened for an insane number of reasons.

312
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,058
Rym: How many times I have canceled someone's panel at the last minute for just random reason even the last minute.

313
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:58,620
Rym: It's a month away Yeah, but I've canceled people's panels like the day before they arrived.

314
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,864
Scott: There are so many reasons.

315
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:05,140
Scott: it could be it could be they had to schedule another panel in that specific time for some reason.

316
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:13,351
Rym: Maybe that's the only time that the company held the representative had Clicked and he got and he got the like acceptance email by accident.

317
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:17,549
Rym: like the CMS is that we all use to manage this kind Of stuff for conventions are not great.

318
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:23,580
Scott: Yeah, there's so many reasons It could have been canceled, but we are pretty sure it's because he's bad person.

319
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:29,440
Rym: So it's even better cuz he's flipping out now and getting his fans to like flip out at pack, right?

320
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,813
Scott: So clearly his reaction is proof.

321
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:34,480
Scott: Oh, yeah, you were a bad person.

322
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,840
Scott: Yep, a good person who received that email would not react this way.

323
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:43,356
Scott: So the fact that you received the email and reacted in this way is only proof that you were.

324
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:47,284
Scott: it was good that you received The email in the first place, but it's extra funny like I'm not gonna like.

325
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:56,280
Rym: I'm just gonna tear down some of the points you might see around this because You're this is gonna be a big enough like shit show on the internet to where you're gonna run into people who care about this.

326
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:06,680
Rym: Yeah, I think this will go away as soon as I think it'll get like a good Whatever I don't like all of them to my block.

327
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,993
Scott: It's only noticeable for us because we're so close to packs panels.

328
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:11,198
Scott: I think most people don't even know.

329
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:11,780
Scott: this is whatever.

330
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,560
Rym: Yeah, but so point number one this dude is like but that's bullshit.

331
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,380
Rym: People are like they bought plane tickets and packs badges to see me there.

332
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:33,067
Rym: well now first of all there is but there is no universe where that is true because They packs didn't even send acceptance emails out for the panels until after the badges were on sale and the badges sold out like Instantly.

333
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:40,659
Scott: that is true, but also Even if he was the one who said I have a packs panel guys come to packs to see me.

334
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:42,833
Scott: Right and people bought badges.

335
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:43,819
Scott: that was him.

336
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:49,619
Scott: Advertising packs did not advertise that he was coming yet They did not put the schedule alive yet.

337
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:53,093
Scott: So to sue packs for that would be false.

338
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:54,940
Scott: packs didn't say come buy tickets.

339
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,822
Scott: This guy is coming.

340
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:58,109
Scott: you said buy tickets to facts.

341
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,940
Scott: I'm coming which clearly was a lie on your part.

342
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:03,503
Scott: It's on you.

343
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:04,426
Rym: so

344
00:22:04,446 --> 00:22:10,187
Scott: - if anything you should have to pay those people back for telling them you were gonna Have a do a panel and you're

345
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:21,257
Rym: not now - this dude is like Emailing back and forth with packs, and he's posting the emails and he is using words Like promissory estoppel.

346
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:22,623
Scott: yes He is clearly.

347
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:26,193
Rym: those are the words that crazy dangerous people say right now.

348
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,780
Rym: that is sovereign citizen adjacent shit.

349
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:32,476
Scott: Yeah, it is not the sovereign citizen language, but it is very adjacent to it.

350
00:22:32,657 --> 00:22:33,420
Scott: very very.

351
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,380
Scott: It's like right next to it in this next lane on the highway sovereign citizen in the right lane.

352
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,667
Scott: He's in the second to right lane.

353
00:22:39,748 --> 00:22:45,314
Scott: Yeah looking out that he looks to his right He sees a sovereign citizen in a rusty old car with fringe on it.

354
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:55,092
Rym: Yep, so three He made a big deal about how I even had access to the back-end system to like Confirm the details of my panel and update my like.

355
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:57,320
Rym: yeah fucking everyone has access to that.

356
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,090
Rym: Yeah, like anyone can submit a panel.

357
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,555
Rym: Yep, anyone.

358
00:23:01,575 --> 00:23:02,820
Rym: Yeah, it just works.

359
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,545
Rym: You can you listening right now.

360
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:05,228
Scott: You can do it.

361
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:05,830
Rym: Yep.

362
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:09,040
Rym: How do you think we started doing shows at PAX one day?

363
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:16,751
Rym: I went to the PAX website, and I clicked on a button and I made an account and then I typed in hey I want to do this panel.

364
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:17,759
Rym: that was it.

365
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:28,123
Rym: so this is This is something to avoid and anyone who is mad about this and is mad at PAX about it is a person To avoid

366
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:35,231
Scott: the only criticism that I have right of PAX's side Which is actually a larger criticism I have of wells in general

367
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:37,900
Rym: where the caveat that we don't actually know the reason.

368
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,863
Scott: Yeah, we don't know the reason.

369
00:23:39,224 --> 00:23:42,395
Rym: if the reason is that is because this dude is a bad person.

370
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:43,900
Scott: is I hope that's the reason.

371
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,480
Rym: We're just guessing we have no inside.

372
00:23:46,900 --> 00:24:09,752
Scott: But wait, I feel that even if it's because the person's a shithead and they are a shithead right that if you kick ban Evict Suspend punish another person in any way for any reason under any system whether it's private public whatever That you should just tell the reason at least to the person right.

373
00:24:09,993 --> 00:24:10,795
Scott: Magna Carta.

374
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:11,838
Scott: What am I being arrested?

375
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:12,440
Scott: Yeah, right?

376
00:24:12,781 --> 00:24:21,800
Scott: It's like they should have at least told the guy your panel is cancelled because and you can you know Hide some of the details if necessary.

377
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:36,000
Rym: I have told people when I ran ConnectiCon for a decade like the panel stuff like, you know I scheduled because every scheduling conflict because yep, uh, you know because we determined that We had too much content of your type.

378
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,296
Rym: We would love you to submit this next year, right?

379
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,400
Rym: But with too much content of their type was basically code for I accidentally accepted a homestuck panel.

380
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,010
Scott: So you get banned from the night's forum, which is super super rare.

381
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:49,254
Scott: We tell you why.

382
00:24:49,274 --> 00:24:50,096
Scott: yeah, right?

383
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:51,420
Scott: You're a Nazi get out of here.

384
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,791
Scott: Yeah, we don't just say you're banned and then you're like why?

385
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:54,474
Scott: why was I bad?

386
00:24:54,515 --> 00:24:55,580
Scott: It's like because you're a Nazi.

387
00:24:55,902 --> 00:24:58,740
Scott: Yeah, because you you you're spelling is bad.

388
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,419
Scott: It wasn't because English is you're not first language and you didn't try to fix it.

389
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:10,040
Rym: now I will say that Every con I've worked with including packs or a panel that might have been scheduled got cancelled or rescheduled or something.

390
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:11,945
Rym: They have told me why.

391
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:16,140
Rym: mm-hmm the fact that no one told this guy why probably means is a bad person.

392
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,137
Rym: But again, we don't know we don't know but we probably know he's probably a bad person.

393
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:33,714
Scott: the only other Criticism I have and this is this is the one that's only true if like if he was kicked off if this panel was kicked out of the schedule because Him or other people on it were bad and therefore they don't want those people on panels at packs.

394
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:38,028
Scott: if that was the reason Why are you giving them the free badges?

395
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:39,294
Rym: You should hand them from packs.

396
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:43,660
Rym: when I scheduled ConnectiCon You know, that was I said I was hundreds of panels.

397
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:47,795
Rym: I like googled and searched social media and poked around the wall.

398
00:25:47,936 --> 00:25:52,560
Scott: for the to be fair You were familiar with the vast majority of the people submitting those panels.

399
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:54,751
Scott: Yeah, if you're hey, you're managing anyone.

400
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,640
Rym: I didn't know like if I saw a panel like huh?

401
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,891
Rym: That one looks interesting, but that's the majority of them.

402
00:25:58,931 --> 00:25:59,393
Scott: You did know.

403
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:02,689
Scott: Yeah, or they had been panelists But not the vast majority.

404
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,513
Rym: more like 60% tops majority.

405
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:11,680
Scott: The point is if you're doing it for the vast majority for packs You don't know none of those people, but you know what I would say - that's gonna be a research project.

406
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,472
Rym: Oh, hey does not have that many panels.

407
00:26:15,255 --> 00:26:15,837
Scott: That's true.

408
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,890
Rym: I Like research.

409
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,280
Scott: a lot of them are industry also.

410
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,363
Rym: Yeah, like you don't need like.

411
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:22,089
Rym: is Square Enix evil like?

412
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,795
Rym: well not in the way that would affect us.

413
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:26,953
Scott: Yeah, right but you know.

414
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:34,599
Scott: Yeah, if someone is a problem to where you're not going to allow them to have a panel at packs because of who they are.

415
00:26:35,342 --> 00:26:38,620
Scott: You should not allow them to be at packs period if they're a problematic human being.

416
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:45,939
Rym: Yep Or in the very least you should say this the P this kind of content is not welcome at our show or this kind of Person is not welcome to present at our show

417
00:26:47,121 --> 00:26:52,800
Scott: Content because it seems like as far as I can tell the panel was literally just their podcast the panel.

418
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,429
Scott: now That may have been a problematic podcast.

419
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,020
Scott: I never have and never will listen to it.

420
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,530
Rym: Yeah, but I mean your podcast.

421
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:04,269
Scott: the panel is not in and of itself a problematic panel Especially when we have specifically been asked to do GeekNights.

422
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:04,871
Scott: the panel.

423
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:14,403
Rym: Yep, but looking at this dude's Twitter If I were scheduling a convention like when I was at Connecticut and I saw this Twitter I wouldn't die.

424
00:27:14,443 --> 00:27:16,290
Rym: This guy would be on my secret blacklist forever.

425
00:27:16,672 --> 00:27:18,338
Rym: Yeah, I did have a secret blacklist.

426
00:27:18,358 --> 00:27:21,176
Rym: Yeah there are a lot of people who were.

427
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:22,042
Rym: Who are?

428
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:26,500
Rym: I made sure they would never get a panel scheduled in case I got hit by a buzz and someone finished the schedule.

429
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:28,373
Scott: But yeah, if you're a bad person who's not?

430
00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:31,948
Scott: if you know You should have the same list for attendee and panelists.

431
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,500
Scott: who who is a person such that you're bad?

432
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,431
Scott: We're not gonna let you speak at this con, but we'll let you come.

433
00:27:38,712 --> 00:27:40,358
Scott: It's like that doesn't line up girl.

434
00:27:40,378 --> 00:27:55,580
Rym: Yeah, well I feel like usually when that happens It's because someone made a mistake and accepting something in the first place and they're trying to just Back out as quietly and drama free as possible, but if the person actually is a problem Well, they're making themselves a problem.

435
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:58,870
Rym: Yeah but that's just evidence that they are the way this dude is reacting.

436
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:03,535
Rym: if I were the in charge of a like if GeekNights started The convention which kind of working on?

437
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:08,057
Scott: stay tuned Kind I kind of one we said we would have in this year.

438
00:28:08,077 --> 00:28:12,732
Rym: Yeah I'm putting more effort into it now that we're finishing up another project.

439
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:13,535
Rym: We were working on.

440
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:16,304
Scott: we are the Branding stuff.

441
00:28:16,585 --> 00:28:18,331
Rym: Oh, yeah now that that is progressed.

442
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:26,198
Rym: Well, I'm actually poking at this again, but Anyway Stay away from this bad, dude.

443
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,162
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

444
00:28:34,222 --> 00:28:36,050
Rym: This is an old thing that you may not have seen.

445
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:48,610
Rym: The something awful forums are not gonna get into the things about those forums, but there's an important part about them In that they were very important to the formation of modern internet culture.

446
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:59,609
Scott: Yeah, good and bad a lot of people, you know It's like it was a very inside group that had an outside influence on Just web culture and a lot of people don't realize the things that spawned from it.

447
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:00,633
Scott: And but it is.

448
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:01,656
Scott: you did as many things.

449
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:02,017
Scott: there are

450
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:25,570
Rym: two very famous stories that are related to each other From something awful and this is a Twitter thread of someone Who basically went into these archives pulled the like an oral history of One of the epic threads from something awful and explain the deal with photos and stuff on Twitter.

451
00:29:25,852 --> 00:29:28,250
Scott: This is actually a thing that you can just do in general for fun.

452
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:37,926
Scott: Just find online communities that have archives like I don't know GeekNights forum Which is archived back to 2005 and go find like a drama thread find a thread of stuff.

453
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:44,490
Rym: That is like an interesting Incident like we did with one of our most popular panels of all time the ballad of dude, bro.

454
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:47,270
Scott: But that was a recent incident at the time, but now it's historic incident.

455
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:53,438
Scott: Yep, and you know dig it up do some like our fact We are still doing digital archaeology.

456
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:56,470
Scott: in most places people talk about the story of what happened.

457
00:29:56,591 --> 00:29:59,209
Rym: We are cited as a like primary source.

458
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:01,103
Scott: I'm just we're not.

459
00:30:01,124 --> 00:30:01,650
Scott: we're a secondary.

460
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,810
Rym: Yeah We're a secondary but we're like cited as the source of the data.

461
00:30:05,152 --> 00:30:08,450
Scott: I went to the actual forum where the thing happened and then did a thing about it.

462
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,365
Scott: I'm a secondary source.

463
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:12,680
Scott: Yeah Anyway, but the point is digital archaeology.

464
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,162
Scott: Cool.

465
00:30:13,383 --> 00:30:21,090
Rym: So this is the story of Something that is affectionately referred to as the machine to kill children.

466
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:25,995
Rym: All right, or the rest in peace line Aka the rip line.

467
00:30:26,296 --> 00:30:29,364
Rym: Okay, the story is like a zipline that's broken.

468
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:31,370
Scott: So is it an action park?

469
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:34,470
Rym: I'm gonna quote this tweet tomorrow.

470
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:39,027
Rym: I'll record recount the story of a dude who built a zipline for a summer camp.

471
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:48,479
Rym: Okay with a 143 foot vertical drop tower to tower bringing a test sandbag up to around 55 to 65 miles an hour How do you stop at the other end?

472
00:30:49,004 --> 00:30:49,105
Scott: Uh

473
00:30:49,770 --> 00:31:05,469
Rym: the story is this dude had got a bunch of like a big budget to make a fun thing at his summer camp like a bunch of money and He and a bunch of people who knew a lot about construction and knew fuck all about engineering or safety Built a zipline that they thought would be cool.

474
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:16,651
Rym: Having imagined someone making a roller coaster who didn't know how roller coasters actually work He made a zipline that if any human being used it in any capacity would kill them All right.

475
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:17,975
Scott: Did anyone actually use it and die?

476
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:26,323
Rym: No, so he basically got he posted in the forum and he was like yo guys I need some got any suggestions on how to make this work.

477
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:33,420
Rym: The kids would come in too fast and the people in something awful Responded basically saying you dumb shit.

478
00:31:33,902 --> 00:31:35,930
Rym: This could never work, right?

479
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,964
Scott: You are an idiot who will kill children as someone who is at a summer camp.

480
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:41,730
Scott: several summer camps with ziplines.

481
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:43,939
Scott: They were lame-o ziplines.

482
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,670
Scott: You don't have a fancy zipline at a summer camp.

483
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,901
Scott: It wasn't the kind where you go across the top of the rainforest.

484
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:49,006
Scott: It was the kind we've done.

485
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:49,870
Rym: that it's real fun.

486
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:52,090
Scott: It was the kind where you just go we and then get off.

487
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,030
Rym: It's the kind it's the South Park guys, right?

488
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,202
Scott: And the way that they worked was you went into the woods.

489
00:31:57,242 --> 00:31:59,330
Scott: you climbed a tree at the top of the tree.

490
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,742
Scott: You tied yourself safely to the rope, right?

491
00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:09,785
Scott: You they let you go And you would go down But then there was a whole bunch of rope after you hit the bottom that was going up.

492
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:11,010
Scott: It was like a sagging rope.

493
00:32:11,332 --> 00:32:14,590
Scott: Yeah, and you didn't end at the other end of the rope, right?

494
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:20,750
Scott: You would sort of hit the bottom of the curve go up a little bit and then come backwards.

495
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:28,470
Scott: So yeah Eventually you'd rest in the middle and then they would let the main rope down with like a pulley system and then they'd unhook.

496
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:33,610
Scott: Yeah, this is and they would pull the zipline back up and it was a saggy rope, right and you would land in the middle.

497
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:39,870
Scott: It's not a straight rope from high to low where you end at the other end and crash into the opposite post and die.

498
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:50,952
Rym: Well, so this is very similar to an adjacent story called Grover house, which is about a dude who Effectively posted a bunch of photos like hey, I'm renovating my house cuz I'm so cool Check this out.

499
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:56,149
Rym: and something awful people responded saying things like wasn't that a load-bearing wall?

500
00:32:57,715 --> 00:32:58,870
Rym: It's a similar situation.

501
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:00,755
Rym: It did so.

502
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:03,684
Rym: well, you can read about Grover house.

503
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,388
Scott: I'm not going to read over.

504
00:33:05,408 --> 00:33:08,074
Scott: house is Amazing I'm sure it is.

505
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:09,719
Scott: I will amazingly stay away from.

506
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,410
Rym: yeah, so this is an oral history of the rip line.

507
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,061
Rym: So what do you got?

508
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:17,710
Scott: Oh, yeah, this is a really simple thing of the day.

509
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,288
Scott: It's just a little tiny video on Twitter.

510
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:24,510
Scott: The caption is Street Fighter is getting a new fan creative with its merch.

511
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,901
Rym: I was gonna say Street Fighters got a new fan.

512
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:28,910
Scott: But yeah, I don't know if this is fan merch.

513
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:33,267
Scott: I don't know if this is actual merch or just something someone made and it doesn't matter what it is.

514
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:36,720
Scott: is You know imagine a stick fan right?

515
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,230
Scott: Yeah, you know an old-school one the kind I have in my bedroom.

516
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,942
Scott: It's a stick at the top of the stick as a circular fan.

517
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:43,710
Scott: Yeah, but the fan oscillates.

518
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,290
Rym: So it turns left and right and she's got that little nub in in the back to control the oscillation like fans head.

519
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:55,204
Scott: So what they have done is at the top of the fan They have put a little thing that is Blanca and he looks like he's getting hit.

520
00:33:55,726 --> 00:34:05,609
Scott: and right next to him They've got Ken doing a hurricane kick on a stick and the stick is in the part of the fan a little nub the little Nub that spins to control the oscillation.

521
00:34:05,971 --> 00:34:09,478
Scott: So Ken is actually doing a hurricane kick next to the Blanca.

522
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,915
Scott: and then really the delicious icing on the cake is the e Honda Attached to the front of the fan.

523
00:34:15,935 --> 00:34:18,723
Rym: the first reply to this tweet that e Honda is fucking dope.

524
00:34:18,902 --> 00:34:23,938
Scott: right the wind from the fan Right is blowing into the Honda.

525
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,763
Scott: He's attached to the front grill.

526
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,909
Scott: His wind is hitting his back.

527
00:34:28,371 --> 00:34:32,327
Scott: They've cut his hand off and attached it with some kind of spring or a pipe cleaner.

528
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:37,030
Scott: It might be a pipe cleaner, but a pipe cleaner has got to be strong or anyway paper.

529
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,072
Rym: I used to be papercraft.

530
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:39,679
Scott: maybe it because of the wind?

531
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:42,909
Scott: his hey, it might actually be three separate hands.

532
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,221
Rym: It looks like it's three separate hands flapping back and forth in the wind.

533
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,408
Scott: But yeah, he's doing a hundred hand.

534
00:34:48,428 --> 00:34:50,375
Scott: slap there Thanks to the wind from the fan.

535
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:54,609
Scott: It is impressive and they added Street Fighter music to the little video.

536
00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:57,309
Scott: I create a masterpiece work of art.

537
00:34:57,751 --> 00:35:01,510
Scott: Enjoy it for it's like 30 seconds and then push rewind and watch it again in the moment.

538
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,310
Rym: Book is the first novel the tale of Genji.

539
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,670
Rym: We'll be live at PAX West with not one but two panels one on Friday on one on Saturday.

540
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,198
Scott: You're really getting through this meta moment quickly.

541
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:11,204
Rym: Yeah, cuz I got stuff to do.

542
00:35:11,687 --> 00:35:12,290
Scott: It's a real moment.

543
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,996
Scott: I'm going somewhere not even a minute.

544
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:18,250
Rym: It's a minute moment and we are not going to talk about the Democratic primary debates.

545
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:23,310
Rym: No, but I will just remind you that GeekNights did formally endorse back in May Elizabeth Warren.

546
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:27,350
Scott: I have not changed my mind after watching the debate only reinforced my decision.

547
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,424
Rym: I did watch the debates and I am now even more solidly in Warren's game.

548
00:35:31,444 --> 00:35:32,648
Rym: Well, there we go.

549
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:33,150
Rym: So that's it.

550
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,256
Rym: Let's talk about cheese.

551
00:35:34,558 --> 00:35:36,348
Scott: All right, so I think we've done a cheese already.

552
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:36,770
Scott: Let's go home.

553
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:38,237
Rym: I don't think we've done a cheese show.

554
00:35:38,278 --> 00:35:40,710
Scott: him deleted the cheese show so we'll have to make a replacement cheese.

555
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:57,065
Rym: So if I had to rank the classes of food that are my favorite foods like broad categories number one is breads And number two is cheeses and then like other stuff is after that like Bread and cheese are some of my favorite things.

556
00:35:57,105 --> 00:36:03,336
Scott: and combining the two I mean, I can't rank like what you got me a rank bread cheese Sugars meat.

557
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:05,470
Rym: so you think about in terms of what if you had to give one up?

558
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,869
Rym: Like I would give up meat before I'd give up cheese.

559
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,979
Rym: Yes, I would give up meat before I'd give up bread.

560
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:13,102
Rym: Yes.

561
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:14,687
Rym: Yeah, that's that's my ring.

562
00:36:14,707 --> 00:36:16,975
Rym: Okay That's how I rank this.

563
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:18,701
Rym: like there is almost nothing.

564
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:24,238
Scott: I would be willing to Give up first cheese or ice cream.

565
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:27,465
Rym: I would give up ice cream first cheese or cookies.

566
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:29,290
Rym: I would give up cookies first.

567
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,502
Rym: Oh, I fucking love cheese.

568
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,286
Scott: You love cookies.

569
00:36:33,306 --> 00:36:33,446
Scott: I do.

570
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:47,091
Rym: It's a regular Sophie's choice here Not that so So Cheese.

571
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:54,109
Rym: I am very thankful that I am NOT lactose intolerant And if I was I would I would just like drink shots of lactate.

572
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:57,656
Scott: Yeah I don't understand why people who are lactose intolerant Maybe like I've heard.

573
00:36:57,696 --> 00:36:59,630
Scott: maybe doesn't work that well now we're getting off topic.

574
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,638
Scott: But like I would just the streamer the stream.

575
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,409
Rym: someone just said how we went from cheese to this.

576
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:08,224
Scott: Anyway, I would take I would just take the lactate pill then eat the cheese.

577
00:37:08,284 --> 00:37:09,450
Scott: I wouldn't give up the cheese ever.

578
00:37:09,823 --> 00:37:16,716
Rym: Yep Never you know like that guy right listen to an NPR show a long time ago with the talk to this dude Who is deathly allergic to shellfish.

579
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:17,880
Rym: and once a year?

580
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:21,010
Rym: He basically eats a bunch of shrimp and then goes to the hospital.

581
00:37:21,591 --> 00:37:22,637
Rym: That's how much he loves shrimp.

582
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:23,281
Scott: That's a guy.

583
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:24,770
Rym: I feel like I would be that way with cheese.

584
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,858
Scott: Why do you need to go to the hospital?

585
00:37:25,878 --> 00:37:25,979
Scott: Then?

586
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:27,249
Scott: Why don't eat it at the hospital?

587
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,504
Rym: Oh, yeah, just go to the hospital and be like.

588
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:33,788
Rym: so listen I'm about to eat all that because the hospital might stop you from eating the shrimp.

589
00:37:34,931 --> 00:37:35,774
Scott: Do eat it in the waiting room.

590
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,804
Rym: So what's your favorite kind of cheese?

591
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:40,370
Scott: can't pick just one kind of cheese.

592
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,181
Rym: We'll treat this more like movies cuz I don't like.

593
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:48,830
Rym: what are your top five movies is a question But I do like name some of your favorite movies.

594
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:56,810
Scott: Oh, I like a gorgonzola cheese because it is a stinky cheese But it is not one of those stinky cheese that is so ridiculously stinky.

595
00:37:56,971 --> 00:38:00,110
Scott: Like you're just trying to prove how ballsy you are by eating the stinkiest cheese.

596
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:06,190
Rym: Well, it's not that like rancid stinky or that ammonia stick exactly and it's not that fungus II blue thing.

597
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,350
Rym: It's like take a little bit because like straight blue cheese, which I love it's good.

598
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:13,924
Scott: But like I guess gorgonzola is like a subset of blue cheese.

599
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:15,430
Scott: That's just like superior, right?

600
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,150
Scott: So I was like when someone says like a little spicier, right?

601
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,430
Scott: So when I see something that's like blue cheese dressing or blue cheese on a burger, I'm kind of mad.

602
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,347
Scott: But when it says gorgonzola, I'm like, I'm in.

603
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,292
Scott: yep I love.

604
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:29,407
Rym: so I'll just cut up gorgonzola and put it on crackers sometimes.

605
00:38:29,448 --> 00:38:42,159
Scott: That's okay Yeah, but that's the thing is even though it is a stinky cheese and it's stinkiness is not ridiculously powerful You know that needs to be like, you know, whatever I do mostly I think maybe 100% of the time I don't eat gorgonzola straight.

606
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,646
Scott: It's got to be in a salad.

607
00:38:43,726 --> 00:38:45,317
Scott: salad is like the best Salad.

608
00:38:45,438 --> 00:38:48,916
Scott: we used to get those two letters Right, that's like the best but you got it.

609
00:38:49,097 --> 00:38:51,385
Scott: It has to have some sort of vehicle.

610
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:52,749
Scott: Yeah for it, right?

611
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:56,770
Scott: You just eat like but with the spoon.

612
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,630
Rym: I'm sure someone does make a French onion soup, but melt gorgonzola instead of mozzarella over the top.

613
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:04,523
Rym: Oh that is that is a powerful soup.

614
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:06,009
Scott: That is literally hot shit.

615
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:22,230
Rym: Well, not shit though, literally hot But good shit, yep, or or you make a grilled cheese with another more like mild gennaro cheese But then you put a little bit of gorgonzola in that you can't just have gorgonzola sandwich gorgonzola cheese with just gorgonzola.

616
00:39:22,432 --> 00:39:23,625
Rym: I don't think that's a good idea.

617
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:32,287
Scott: No, no No, if you did make like a big sub right with say likes You know some deli meats and some maybe some even some other cheeses maybe lettuce tomato onion something like that.

618
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:36,842
Scott: You could Sprinkle gorgonzola bits down the middle of the sandwich.

619
00:39:36,862 --> 00:39:38,429
Scott: Yeah, that's good - and that would work.

620
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:42,682
Rym: Also, I like gorgonzola on a burger a lot.

621
00:39:42,802 --> 00:39:45,090
Scott: It's okay as long as not more so than blue cheese.

622
00:39:45,573 --> 00:39:50,561
Scott: Oh, yeah, but I mean like I just said if I saw blue cheese burger I would pass but if I saw a gorgonzola burger, I would order.

623
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:51,364
Rym: Yep.

624
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:52,690
Rym: I'm trying to find lists of cheeses.

625
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,537
Rym: There's just too many cheeses, right?

626
00:39:54,677 --> 00:39:58,270
Scott: I mean, so I know right let's talk about the elephant in the room, right?

627
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,577
Scott: Obviously fake cheese, we're not even gonna go to fake cheese.

628
00:40:00,657 --> 00:40:02,422
Scott: Fuck your easy cheese.

629
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:05,070
Scott: Fuck your Velveeta's get that shit out of here.

630
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:05,975
Scott: I don't even eat that stuff.

631
00:40:06,016 --> 00:40:06,519
Scott: It's garbage.

632
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:14,347
Scott: So I also hate anything Like Cheetos or cheese puffs where it's like this nasty cheese powder that's on there.

633
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:15,149
Rym: I was cheese.

634
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,352
Rym: It's cheese.

635
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:17,355
Scott: It's our real cheese.

636
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:18,839
Scott: They taste actually like cheddar.

637
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,622
Scott: It's real cheddar.

638
00:40:19,922 --> 00:40:21,286
Scott: same thing with cheddar goldfish.

639
00:40:21,748 --> 00:40:22,530
Scott: I can eat those two.

640
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,333
Scott: Yep, it's not.

641
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:26,525
Scott: those aren't a matter of like a cheese poof where it's like this powder.

642
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:27,690
Scott: that's like blasted on.

643
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:28,995
Scott: It's a matter of like.

644
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:31,506
Scott: no the cheese is integrated into the cheese at cracker.

645
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:32,490
Scott: is real cheese.

646
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,593
Scott: It tastes like real cheese.

647
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:34,375
Scott: It's good.

648
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:36,039
Rym: So I basically won't.

649
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,070
Scott: it's not a cheeto or dorito where it's like orange fire of poison.

650
00:40:40,432 --> 00:40:45,537
Rym: I will never seek out on purpose or eat by design American cheese.

651
00:40:45,678 --> 00:40:47,207
Scott: Okay, so this is just too bland.

652
00:40:47,308 --> 00:40:47,610
Scott: Well, okay.

653
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:48,954
Scott: So here's the thing with America.

654
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:50,479
Scott: I got some American cheese.

655
00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:52,867
Rym: You can always do better in any situation.

656
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:59,245
Scott: Most people Have experienced only Kraft singles American cheese, which tastes like nothing.

657
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,314
Scott: Yeah, they don't taste bad They just taste like nothing.

658
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:04,381
Rym: even a good American cheese is no.

659
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:07,350
Rym: Kraft single is not as good as literally any other cheese.

660
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,730
Scott: There are good better American cheeses.

661
00:41:10,937 --> 00:41:15,739
Rym: If you want a generic American cheese Just get like a Colby Jack or a Jack cheese instead.

662
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:24,593
Scott: if you were to buy like Lando lakes or Boar's Head American cheese Which I guess are normal higher-end brands that are available at every deli counter in America It's still not worth it.

663
00:41:24,613 --> 00:41:25,818
Rym: There's no reason to eat that shit.

664
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,630
Scott: They are not the same.

665
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:30,762
Rym: Trying to defend American cheese.

666
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:32,109
Rym: You really tried to set this up.

667
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:34,279
Scott: I know why you're trying to attack American cheese.

668
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:36,670
Rym: not an elephant in the room to understand that American cheese.

669
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,490
Rym: It's just not worth eating any circumstances.

670
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:43,590
Scott: It is not an exciting fancy cheese by any stretch of the imagination.

671
00:41:43,931 --> 00:41:48,149
Rym: Monterey Jack the like most flavorless generic cheese.

672
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:52,546
Scott: It is not a strong flavor that these good American cheeses have.

673
00:41:52,566 --> 00:41:53,650
Rym: but what are you?

674
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,762
Rym: Gonna wrap a hot dog in American cheese.

675
00:41:55,802 --> 00:41:57,230
Rym: Like is that we're gonna eat that your meal now?

676
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,155
Scott: That's not we use it for.

677
00:41:58,657 --> 00:42:06,306
Rym: but that good not All right Crap, you use American cheese for other than a Philly cheesesteak, which is the only acceptable place.

678
00:42:06,346 --> 00:42:15,150
Rym: because that's what a Philly cheesesteak A lot of things with it because why would you waste bread on a grilled cheese?

679
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,288
Scott: It is not a strong flavor, but it is a flavor.

680
00:42:19,332 --> 00:42:21,330
Rym: I'm only gonna not disagree that it is a flavor.

681
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:24,078
Scott: That is not a flavor that you will find with other cheese.

682
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,944
Scott: American cheese does have a distinct.

683
00:42:25,964 --> 00:42:31,890
Scott: you gave me a real not craft Singles, I mean, I guess I could tell a craft single just by the texture because it has like this plastic enos to it.

684
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,463
Rym: You gave me an American cheese and I was blindfolded.

685
00:42:34,543 --> 00:42:38,410
Rym: I would say this tastes like Nothing, this must be American cheese.

686
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:44,430
Scott: No If you gave me an American cheese Right, it has a distinct flavor a real American cheese.

687
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:50,150
Scott: That is not the same as say a quite adjacent Munster cheese, right?

688
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:55,870
Scott: Even though they're pretty close in their power levels, right and it is a sometimes useful cheese.

689
00:42:55,971 --> 00:43:01,879
Scott: I will not often choose it But I will also not you know Put it down as much as Rym.

690
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,850
Scott: who wants to just wipe it off the face of the earth?

691
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:14,041
Rym: So in the I found a mental floss article about American cheese, okay in the old days, you know, though, however First white is complete bullshit.

692
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:14,845
Scott: They taste the same.

693
00:43:14,865 --> 00:43:15,830
Scott: It's just food coloring.

694
00:43:16,132 --> 00:43:17,298
Scott: You should order the yellow cuz.

695
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,022
Scott: it's cheaper cuz.

696
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:18,626
Scott: for some reason.

697
00:43:18,646 --> 00:43:22,725
Scott: stupid Americans Just are want the white color and not the yellow color.

698
00:43:23,027 --> 00:43:23,750
Scott: Just save money.

699
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,940
Scott: It tastes exactly the same get yellow American if you're gonna get American.

700
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:29,890
Rym: so pretty much almost all American cheese is just cheese food.

701
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:30,833
Rym: It's not actually cheese.

702
00:43:31,114 --> 00:43:31,375
Scott: Uh-huh.

703
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:34,185
Rym: Like it like even the fancy stuff is processed.

704
00:43:34,225 --> 00:43:34,526
Rym: It's not.

705
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:35,710
Rym: actually they can't call it.

706
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,358
Scott: I mean, I mean what's your team?

707
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:39,770
Scott: All these other cheese at the telecounter are also processed.

708
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:43,783
Rym: Yeah, but Munster has a flavor and is in American cheese.

709
00:43:43,844 --> 00:43:44,526
Rym: Yeah, nothing.

710
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:45,770
Scott: No, it has a flavor.

711
00:43:46,372 --> 00:43:49,803
Scott: So I'm gonna quote you just hate American cheese so much you avoid it.

712
00:43:49,823 --> 00:43:50,345
Scott: So you don't even know.

713
00:43:50,385 --> 00:43:50,726
Scott: it's late.

714
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:58,287
Rym: classically before Factory processed stuff at the market American cheese was actually just a blend of cheddar and Colby.

715
00:43:58,628 --> 00:44:09,082
Rym: Okay If if you give me a blend of cheddar and Colby sure that is fine I dare you to find an American cheese that is called American cheese.

716
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:12,170
Rym: That is actually just a blend of cheddar and Colby.

717
00:44:13,331 --> 00:44:15,658
Rym: Also, what's with outside of the Midwest?

718
00:44:15,698 --> 00:44:16,561
Rym: No one has Colby cheese.

719
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:18,628
Rym: Like I rarely find Colby cheese anywhere.

720
00:44:18,648 --> 00:44:19,230
Rym: That's true.

721
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,927
Scott: It is not a thing here in the north in New York area.

722
00:44:21,947 --> 00:44:24,941
Rym: as a kid I guess go to the deli and buy like a brick of Colby.

723
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,810
Scott: Colby is not a frequently used cheese.

724
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,717
Scott: I don't really see it on restaurant menus.

725
00:44:28,757 --> 00:44:29,701
Scott: I don't see it on burgers.

726
00:44:29,741 --> 00:44:31,006
Scott: You can get Colby Jack.

727
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:32,130
Scott: I don't see it at the grocery.

728
00:44:32,511 --> 00:44:39,610
Scott: I think that the Italian cheeses are sort of like have most of the the market share here in the New York zone.

729
00:44:41,356 --> 00:44:43,162
Scott: Your parmesans your provolone.

730
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:47,870
Rym: pure Colby cheese is not that good for a lot of applications Like it's good on a salad maybe or something, but it's kind of crumbly.

731
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,955
Scott: I think it's the kind of cheese you'll see a lot of times and like maybe like a Cobb salad Which is not my favorite.

732
00:44:53,297 --> 00:44:55,066
Rym: Cobb salad is one of my favorite kinds of salads.

733
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:55,729
Scott: not into it.

734
00:44:56,091 --> 00:45:02,390
Rym: But that's the reason why if you find Colby cheese in most of the coastal cities in America It's always Colby Jack.

735
00:45:02,531 --> 00:45:10,058
Rym: It's Colby cheese and Jack sort of mixed together because Jack makes it more meltable and like usable like it makes it more generic and easy to cook with.

736
00:45:10,118 --> 00:45:17,343
Scott: yeah, Jack is like the number one cheese you see on the Plate to put cheese on crackers because it's like the generic cheese.

737
00:45:17,403 --> 00:45:18,366
Scott: right that will not.

738
00:45:18,526 --> 00:45:19,570
Scott: that will not offend.

739
00:45:20,453 --> 00:45:21,838
Scott: They'll be right everybody.

740
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:23,744
Rym: It's no one's sensibility, right?

741
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:27,280
Scott: It doesn't taste like nothing Right, it doesn't.

742
00:45:27,481 --> 00:45:28,710
Rym: it tastes close to nothing.

743
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:31,679
Rym: Jack is only a step above American cheese.

744
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,141
Scott: also.

745
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:35,070
Scott: people usually would use like a pepper jack for that that has peppery stuff in it.

746
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,380
Rym: Well, yeah, cuz you got to add something to it.

747
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,670
Rym: cuz the cheese by itself is not that good.

748
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:40,863
Rym: It's actually kind of springy and a little rubbery like it's not good doesn't know?

749
00:45:40,883 --> 00:45:41,647
Scott: it's a little tough.

750
00:45:41,928 --> 00:45:47,650
Scott: Yeah Fight into it or like, you know to get the knife through is a little bit of a little bit effort.

751
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:52,630
Rym: Yep, and a Janae Jap your jack cheese grilled cheese sandwich not really better.

752
00:45:53,832 --> 00:45:56,210
Scott: It's not a cheese for grilling it's just the cheese you're putting on a cracker.

753
00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:01,770
Scott: Yeah, no, so it's like you have that and it's like people who would avoid your powerful stinky cheese.

754
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,505
Scott: Right and you know don't want to eat a cheese.

755
00:46:04,546 --> 00:46:05,310
Scott: It's a weird color.

756
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:07,042
Scott: That's what that Jack cheese is for.

757
00:46:07,303 --> 00:46:08,250
Rym: Jack cheese is for boring.

758
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:10,742
Scott: It goes on the cheese plate to be eaten by the boring people.

759
00:46:10,803 --> 00:46:11,627
Scott: It has a flavor, right?

760
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,804
Scott: It's a stronger flavor than an American cheese, but it's not.

761
00:46:15,965 --> 00:46:19,156
Scott: you know, I'm not Buying at the store really.

762
00:46:19,397 --> 00:46:20,562
Rym: so in terms of a cheese.

763
00:46:20,642 --> 00:46:22,490
Rym: I like to just eat by itself.

764
00:46:22,651 --> 00:46:31,580
Rym: I'm pretty much if I. actually while I do like some stinky cheeses the cheeses I like to eat the most are like a port salut a Cheddar like just straight-up cheddar.

765
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:33,150
Rym: I will just eat on crackers cheddar.

766
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:36,210
Scott: I feel like I got a like, you know, I use it to like melt onto something.

767
00:46:36,411 --> 00:46:41,047
Scott: Usually I like cheddars when there's some kind of barbecue sauce involved.

768
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:50,963
Scott: Oh, yeah I can see that like if you're making a burger or it's like a chicken sandwich and you're getting some barbecue sauce on it and Maybe some onion and it's like the cheese that's got to get.

769
00:46:51,023 --> 00:46:52,730
Scott: the only cheddar cheese goes in that mix.

770
00:46:52,911 --> 00:47:02,216
Rym: No other cheese fits in that like the cheese by itself I like just like a white goat cheese, but a cheddar cheese doesn't work on like a sub sandwich But like a port salut.

771
00:47:02,798 --> 00:47:05,707
Rym: or I also like manchego and like that class of cheese is a lot.

772
00:47:05,847 --> 00:47:09,949
Scott: Mm-hmm I mean if I'm not going down the barbecue road.

773
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:16,119
Scott: Alright, if I'm melting a cheese onto a thing It's got to be the best possible cheese is something.

774
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,145
Scott: and like the Gruyere family.

775
00:47:18,185 --> 00:47:21,616
Rym: Oh, all right That means we got to talk about grilled cheeses.

776
00:47:21,897 --> 00:47:25,653
Rym: The best grilled cheese is Gruyere plus a different cheese Anything.

777
00:47:25,693 --> 00:47:27,990
Scott: there are other cheeses that are like in the Gruyere family.

778
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:32,343
Rym: Take a Gruyere or a Gruyere adjacent because they put one other cheese.

779
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:36,397
Rym: It's not only their flavor that works So well, they melt is so good.

780
00:47:36,497 --> 00:47:39,849
Scott: It's the way they melt makes it perfect for the function.

781
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:45,050
Scott: Yeah It's like there are a lot of cheeses that might actually taste great if you were to say grilled cheese them.

782
00:47:45,591 --> 00:47:49,002
Scott: But you they don't melt nicely and they make a mess.

783
00:47:49,102 --> 00:47:56,354
Rym: or they get too messy or maybe they don't melt enough Or they take a lot of effort like you could make a grilled cheese with them But it takes a lot of effort.

784
00:47:56,635 --> 00:48:00,430
Rym: with like a Gruyere like Gruyere Swiss together works really well.

785
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,215
Scott: It was like designed for melting.

786
00:48:02,496 --> 00:48:02,757
Rym: Yep.

787
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,290
Scott: So, uh in terms this is more of a cold sandwich cheese.

788
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:12,770
Rym: Yeah, if I make a lot of time or a burger cheese, yeah, sometimes Swiss is good on a burger by the mushroom.

789
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:16,197
Rym: I like Emma Emmental better than Swiss for that.

790
00:48:16,398 --> 00:48:20,778
Scott: Yeah, what I tend to use Swiss for is like a lot of times what I'll do when I'm Lazy is for dinner.

791
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:21,745
Scott: I'll make a cheese sandwich.

792
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:23,734
Scott: I'll buy a bread Yeah, and I'll just not.

793
00:48:23,794 --> 00:48:25,501
Scott: not a hot sandwich a cold sandwich.

794
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:28,170
Scott: I'll put on you know, no meats, right?

795
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:35,345
Scott: I'll just put on like cheese cheese cheese cheese lettuce tomato onion Maybe not even lettuce peppers salt and pepper maybe a dressing right?

796
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:40,144
Scott: It's basically a salad on a bread But that I like a salad on a bread and that's where I bust out my Swiss.

797
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:41,690
Scott: I'll bust out provolone.

798
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,257
Scott: Yeah bust out Munster.

799
00:48:43,518 --> 00:48:46,130
Scott: Those are the kinds of cheeses that go on the cold sandwich.

800
00:48:46,473 --> 00:48:53,790
Scott: Also, if I am getting a sandwich even with meats Yeah, right and I do do and it's it's kind of sandwich where I am gonna put cheese with the meat together.

801
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:57,500
Scott: Those are the same cheeses that I will go to right, you know.

802
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:01,450
Scott: provolone plus, you know, some kind of Italian meats together.

803
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:03,337
Scott: This is how it works.

804
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:04,503
Rym: Yep in turn.

805
00:49:04,543 --> 00:49:11,808
Rym: I'm a big fan of Like the breeze and all the like fungusy cheeses, but I actually do not like the rind like.

806
00:49:11,828 --> 00:49:13,534
Rym: that's just a thing I don't know.

807
00:49:13,634 --> 00:49:14,618
Scott: I do not eat the rind either.

808
00:49:14,638 --> 00:49:16,445
Rym: I love brie, but I'm this dude.

809
00:49:16,525 --> 00:49:17,910
Scott: I gotta eat the mushy part.

810
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,054
Scott: That's like you can good part.

811
00:49:19,094 --> 00:49:19,836
Rym: You can spoon it.

812
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:22,184
Scott: It's so mushy right that inside the rind.

813
00:49:22,224 --> 00:49:26,644
Scott: Yeah, but like the rind itself It's like it's all hard and it tastes too strong and weird.

814
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:30,375
Rym: Well, it tastes too Fungusy and like musty.

815
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:31,399
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

816
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:35,110
Rym: I mean, I don't like people can like that like I can see the appeal.

817
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:37,100
Rym: I just don't personally enjoy that.

818
00:49:37,382 --> 00:49:46,564
Rym: that's partly why as much as I like brie I tend to go with port salut because it's similar to the brie in terms of like how you would eat it and like why You'd like it, but there's like an inedible rind.

819
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:50,889
Rym: You just don't eat You just get the good port salut in the middle and you get a lot more of it.

820
00:49:52,751 --> 00:50:01,500
Rym: I'm also a fan of like Huntsman cheeses and like all the sort of like really strong flavored cheeses that aren't that stinky But they have a really strong flavor like or like Stilton.

821
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:02,985
Rym: Love me a still.

822
00:50:03,005 --> 00:50:08,830
Rym: the Stilton is like the dreaming cheese Arguably probably just because it causes significant indigestion.

823
00:50:10,011 --> 00:50:11,377
Rym: It may or may not have chemicals.

824
00:50:11,417 --> 00:50:12,221
Rym: that mess with dreams.

825
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,587
Rym: It's jury's still out.

826
00:50:13,888 --> 00:50:14,270
Rym: I do like it.

827
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,518
Scott: Oh, I think wasn't like Comte.

828
00:50:16,538 --> 00:50:18,164
Scott: I think that was the Gruyere adjacent cheese.

829
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:18,565
Rym: I think so.

830
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:19,850
Rym: Yeah, that was good for me.

831
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:20,880
Rym: I'm not a cheese expert.

832
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,970
Rym: Our friend Natalie is way.

833
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:26,158
Scott: Yeah Shop in New York Murray's cheese.

834
00:50:26,479 --> 00:50:29,110
Rym: Not only can know they're opening one right next like right down the street.

835
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:30,114
Rym: Oh like right there.

836
00:50:30,134 --> 00:50:30,777
Scott: It's a chain.

837
00:50:30,837 --> 00:50:36,530
Scott: I've only seen it in New York City, but it is a chain and their outlet is Oh, yeah over by the rail yard in this neighborhood.

838
00:50:36,611 --> 00:50:39,450
Rym: You can go there and buy like they're defected a whole wheel.

839
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:44,250
Rym: You can buy a whole wheel that's defective because it got dented for like 10% of the normal price.

840
00:50:45,693 --> 00:50:46,920
Scott: But yeah, it's it's a chain.

841
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,126
Scott: I've only seen in New York City.

842
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:48,870
Scott: It might be elsewhere.

843
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:56,090
Scott: They have such a crazy variety of cheeses there like it's amazing top-flight cheeses down to the cheapy cheeses.

844
00:50:56,492 --> 00:50:59,365
Scott: Right, you know, it's just a cheese shop.

845
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:04,110
Scott: It's amazing and Natalie goes there and like that's like her favorite stuff.

846
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,185
Scott: She's all into the cheese as I go and I'm just like let's try that cheese.

847
00:51:08,225 --> 00:51:09,410
Scott: I never heard of whatever.

848
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:13,241
Rym: Yeah, I do like the smoked cheese is like the Gouda.

849
00:51:13,543 --> 00:51:14,326
Scott: Yeah, that's a good one.

850
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:15,050
Scott: It's a good.

851
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:15,773
Scott: It's a good one.

852
00:51:15,974 --> 00:51:18,265
Rym: I tend to only like Gouda like by itself though.

853
00:51:18,305 --> 00:51:21,444
Rym: Like I don't really cook with it I don't really like try to make things out of it.

854
00:51:21,484 --> 00:51:33,590
Rym: I just eat it Like I do separate cheeses and do the cheese they put on salads the ones I put on sandwiches the ones I'll just eat As a primary thing and the ones I will cook with Mmm like mozzarella.

855
00:51:34,273 --> 00:51:40,141
Rym: Actually, I will cook with and I'll just eat because I love mozzarella Mmm, especially like a good and I like.

856
00:51:40,383 --> 00:51:47,845
Rym: I really like cheese curds like just gennaro cheese curd, but I think the mozzarella right is like growing up.

857
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:51,175
Scott: that was when like the the String cheese was invented.

858
00:51:51,396 --> 00:51:52,279
Scott: Yeah, right.

859
00:51:52,399 --> 00:51:55,830
Scott: So it's like first of all, you're in love with mozzarella cuz on pizza, right?

860
00:51:56,111 --> 00:51:57,335
Scott: It's like you can't really.

861
00:51:57,355 --> 00:52:02,817
Scott: you mean you can you can and maybe mix some other cheeses onto the pizza But mozzarella has got to be there.

862
00:52:02,897 --> 00:52:03,399
Scott: Yeah, right.

863
00:52:03,439 --> 00:52:08,250
Scott: It's just like that wet cheese, you know It melts on to the pizza at the high temperature.

864
00:52:08,971 --> 00:52:11,825
Scott: Right, you don't let it go so far that it gets burnt and crusty.

865
00:52:11,906 --> 00:52:19,969
Scott: Yeah, right It's like, you know, but when it's more dried out you you know You can you can pull it into the strings you can tear apart with your hands, right?

866
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,193
Scott: It's like that's.

867
00:52:21,434 --> 00:52:26,770
Scott: it's you know, but definitely I'm all about buying the the raw mozzarella.

868
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:31,670
Scott: It's still in some kind of liquid or a ball or something like that the fresh mozzarella.

869
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:34,157
Scott: I don't buy, you know, the shredded stuff anymore.

870
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:34,619
Scott: Really?

871
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:35,882
Scott: Yeah, it's all dried out.

872
00:52:35,943 --> 00:52:38,390
Scott: It's not as you know, not as good like that.

873
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:42,990
Rym: I usually get a big block of feta usually Greek but sometimes French or Bulgarian like they're fine.

874
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:43,677
Scott: I mean, I'm in the.

875
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:47,382
Scott: I live in Greek land so like every grocery store has like several different feta.

876
00:52:47,442 --> 00:52:47,764
Scott: so

877
00:52:48,025 --> 00:52:56,770
Rym: I'm not gonna lie I Enjoy Bulgarian feta more than Greek feta and I'll make Greek and Turkish salads with Bulgarian feta primarily

878
00:52:57,032 --> 00:53:06,289
Scott: For me, I mean it is a situation for me where Sometimes I'll get feta cheese like, you know Like you'll get a salad a Greek salad and they'll be the feta wrapped in the leaves in there.

879
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:07,232
Scott: Yeah, and like.

880
00:53:07,293 --> 00:53:09,460
Scott: sometimes it's like, oh, this is so great.

881
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:20,094
Scott: this feta cheese, you know, it's working great crumbled up in this salad it's you know, but sometimes I get it and he's just like, uh, and I'm since it's always been the case the more expensive feta is just Better right?

882
00:53:20,275 --> 00:53:26,890
Scott: It's like I wasn't the one who chose the feta But there were like times where I eat it and it's like ew and times I eat it where it's like.

883
00:53:27,753 --> 00:53:28,697
Rym: So this is one of those.

884
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:31,550
Scott: pretty sure it's a. I only like expensive feta.

885
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:40,998
Rym: And yeah, cheese is one of those things where except for like these basic cheeses that are very ubiquitous in America Most cheeses the more money you pay up to a point.

886
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:42,202
Rym: It is just better.

887
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:44,870
Rym: Yeah, like way better and that sucks.

888
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,015
Rym: But that's the reality.

889
00:53:46,075 --> 00:53:49,088
Scott: I think there's that series of videos with like food expert.

890
00:53:49,832 --> 00:53:52,304
Scott: I think they'd one just went up today with mustard expert.

891
00:53:52,364 --> 00:53:58,004
Scott: Whoo, but Yeah, I think we made it thing of the day when we discovered it because there was cheese.

892
00:53:58,064 --> 00:53:59,888
Scott: expert was like one of their first videos.

893
00:54:00,973 --> 00:54:01,478
Scott: So watch that.

894
00:54:01,659 --> 00:54:05,446
Rym: Yeah, so on that note I think we're gonna stop here cuz I gotta go eat some cheese is happier before.

895
00:54:05,466 --> 00:54:08,280
Scott: I talk about some Parmesan and sprinkly cheese.

896
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:09,590
Rym: All right, we'll do one last bit.

897
00:54:09,891 --> 00:54:14,384
Rym: So these are the the accent cheeses that you sprinkle on to another dish, right?

898
00:54:14,404 --> 00:54:15,386
Scott: You get your parmesan.

899
00:54:15,447 --> 00:54:16,630
Scott: It's usually Italian, right?

900
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:19,798
Scott: It's parmesan pecorino slash romano.

901
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:22,265
Rym: I tend to do this lately with Manchego.

902
00:54:22,485 --> 00:54:24,250
Rym: I'll just read Manchego over stuff.

903
00:54:24,491 --> 00:54:28,450
Scott: Yeah, if you get the microplane you can do it with a lot of cheeses that you normally couldn't do it.

904
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,504
Scott: We know it as long as the cheese is hard enough.

905
00:54:30,787 --> 00:54:32,252
Rym: Yeah, which Secret?

906
00:54:32,534 --> 00:54:38,111
Rym: if you got a cheese that isn't hard enough just put it in the freezer for like a minute Yep, and then you can shred it right.

907
00:54:38,172 --> 00:54:45,556
Scott: sometimes though you shred it and then like if your dish is hot it melts and Disappears and sort of mixes into the dish Like with the chili.

908
00:54:45,636 --> 00:54:48,748
Scott: you want that sometimes with the chili, but sometimes you want the coating.

909
00:54:48,768 --> 00:54:56,590
Rym: no I wanted to mix in usually anyway, but yeah the Parmesan cheese You definitely I never get it grated anymore.

910
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:01,910
Scott: I will grate it at definitely have to watch out for the ones with the sawdust filler and stuff like that.

911
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,235
Scott: It's not gonna hurt you.

912
00:55:03,355 --> 00:55:09,799
Scott: but it's like yeah the already grated Parmesan even if it's fancy brand It's like no there's filler and stuff in there.

913
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,870
Scott: It's not the best cheese and it goes bad quicker, right?

914
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:17,730
Scott: You want to get the solid piece of Parmesan even if it's just a little sliver triangle.

915
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:20,399
Scott: You can grate it yourself if there's mold on there.

916
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,330
Scott: You can scrape it off and start shredding underneath, right?

917
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:24,733
Scott: That's the way you go.

918
00:55:24,853 --> 00:55:30,070
Scott: And if you got the monies, it's like actually yes be like special product.

919
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:34,021
Scott: Parmesan o reggiano is just better.

920
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:40,545
Scott: Yeah, it's like just go for it Buy like a tiny slivery triangle of it cuz a lot of money and shred it yourself.

921
00:55:41,128 --> 00:55:41,730
Scott: It's worth it.

922
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:42,132
Scott: So one thing

923
00:55:42,152 --> 00:55:56,789
Rym: I like about living in New York is that it's very easy to just on my way home Like if I want a fancy cheese for something I will buy like a Tiny bit of that cheese at a cheese shop and have it home and I eat it all in that meal And there's no chance of it going to waste just no chance of it going bad.

924
00:55:57,332 --> 00:56:00,286
Rym: I'm not gonna try to explain to you how to not let your cheese go bad.

925
00:56:00,326 --> 00:56:06,385
Scott: Just like Google it Right, and I guess we're not gonna talk about any sort of creamed cheeses here, right?

926
00:56:06,425 --> 00:56:07,067
Rym: No, we can't.

927
00:56:07,107 --> 00:56:08,130
Rym: that's a whole topic.

928
00:56:09,498 --> 00:56:10,523
Rym: I feel like we talked about that.

929
00:56:10,563 --> 00:56:11,690
Rym: We have to do a whole show about it.

00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:14,539
Scott: This is the bagel show just on cream cheese the bagels.

931
