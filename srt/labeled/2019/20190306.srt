1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,650
Rym: It's Wednesday, March 6th, 2019.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,512
Rym: I'm Rym Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,860
Rym: We're reviewing the anime tatami galaxy.

4
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:25,044
Scott: Let's do this All right.

5
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:31,991
Scott: So today I'm sitting at my desk like you do and usually, you know, I have headphone problems But that's usually with earbuds because the wire gets all messed up.

6
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:41,227
Rym: when you got in your pocket on the subway and walk I actually just left a good pair of headphones that are noise isolating On my desk in Japan.

7
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:41,890
Rym: It's the same ones.

8
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,533
Rym: I got hanging here.

9
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:44,200
Rym: So I got two pair of these fancy headphones.

10
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:52,000
Scott: So yeah at work I got some over-ear ones with a replaceable cable and no an active noise cancelling with a triple-a battery.

11
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:54,550
Scott: So those should not have any problem.

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,037
Scott: the wire breaks I can replace it.

13
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:59,730
Scott: if the battery dies I recharge it, you know, it's all good right there over the ear.

14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,999
Scott: They shouldn't be fragile and break, you know little You know, there's no fragile bits, right?

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,339
Scott: But today I'm sitting there on my desk and like the right ear cuts out and I'm like what the fuck?

16
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:14,945
Scott: So then I like, you know check it and it's fixed and then it cuts out Huh?

17
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:17,840
Scott: That is so I was sitting there.

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,380
Scott: So first of all, I'm like what is going on with this Caesar analog, right?

19
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:24,126
Rym: Yeah, okay.

20
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:25,695
Scott: Well, I mean the noise cancelling it.

21
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:26,540
Scott: I guess yeah, they're analog.

22
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:29,338
Scott: It doesn't have its own sound card in it, right?

23
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:37,600
Scott: But anyway, so total the wire I plug it, you know, I'm like wait a minute and I realized what was happening was so strange.

24
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:40,766
Scott: There's nothing wrong with my headphones.

25
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:42,371
Scott: So problem number one.

26
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:44,277
Scott: I was chewing some gum while listening.

27
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:49,167
Scott: Oh Only on the right side Right.

28
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:52,869
Rym: I've had something similar happen I think to what you're about to sound like.

29
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,075
Scott: am I messing up my ear?

30
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:55,663
Rym: cuz my Animotics?

31
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,040
Rym: not not the earbud the earbuds but the actual ear plugs.

32
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:11,130
Rym: If I put it in my right ear in my left ear a particular way My right ear will do something weird where if it's pushed in slightly too far it like closes My ear entirely and I hear nothing like that.

33
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,812
Rym: ears just dead.

34
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:13,860
Scott: Well, this is nice is over ear not in ear.

35
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:15,447
Rym: Oh, yeah, okay the plot thickens.

36
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:18,480
Scott: So, you know, I'm like, there's nothing wrong with my right ear.

37
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,920
Scott: So I take them off and I'm listening to stuff doing the Archer thing mop, right?

38
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,919
Scott: It's like you're making noise like I guess my right ear works or I can hear you.

39
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,766
Scott: I'm pretty sure my right ear is working.

40
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:27,710
Scott: I'm not I'm not going.

41
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,400
Rym: I remember I had faster than expected when I was young.

42
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:34,913
Rym: I had a small Explosive go off kind of close to me and I remember like sitting there for a while.

43
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:35,576
Rym: Like is this here?

44
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:36,620
Scott: Yeah, right ear works.

45
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:37,318
Scott: Okay, I'm good.

46
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:39,087
Scott: What was happening?

47
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:40,132
Scott: I finally solved it.

48
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,458
Scott: Is that problem?

49
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:41,759
Scott: one?

50
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:43,346
Scott: Chewing gum.

51
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:46,889
Scott: All right problem two I'm bald.

52
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:53,155
Scott: So the the pad Right around my ear like as I was chewing.

53
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:59,260
Scott: somehow air was Evacuating either into my ear hole or out and then it was creating like a suction.

54
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:01,427
Scott: So there was no air in.

55
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:05,580
Scott: it was sealed around my ear and there was no air in there anymore.

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,768
Scott: So the speaker was vibrating.

57
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:10,840
Scott: nothing or almost not enough air molecules.

58
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:16,989
Scott: So even though the speaker is still vibrating in the headphone It wasn't shaking anything.

59
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,539
Scott: so it couldn't shake anything inside my ear.

60
00:03:20,182 --> 00:03:21,205
Rym: That's plausible.

61
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:22,249
Scott: so I couldn't hear nothing.

62
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:28,914
Scott: cuz basically I tested this improved it because every time it happened I just broke the seal and it suddenly it started working again.

63
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:32,465
Rym: That's uh That's like reverse farting.

64
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:32,927
Rym: that's right.

65
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:36,140
Scott: if I had air if I had hair wouldn't have a problem.

66
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,880
Scott: If I wasn't chewing gum wouldn't have a problem because it wouldn't be like squeezing the air out.

67
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,229
Rym: Well depends on what hair.

68
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:50,038
Scott: because you're talking about hair in the air Any hair that would break the seal of the pad on an over the ear completely surrounding the ear headphones.

69
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:51,724
Scott: Yeah, right I have no hairs.

70
00:03:51,865 --> 00:04:01,069
Scott: Yeah, and and I guess if I wash the side of my head Even though I just like a shower last night if I just wash the side of my head I guess maybe in the grease wouldn't.

71
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:23,991
Rym: I'm not gonna to go into details on the thing I'm about to reference but you may remember a thing We read or that based from poop report at RIT about the dangers of shaving certain areas and the suction and resulting suction related issues that can occur Shaving your butt hair that story when he broke the seal.

72
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:24,472
Scott: Yeah, I know.

73
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:27,640
Rym: Yeah that one feel like it's an adjacent problem.

74
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:30,986
Rym: So, what are you gonna do anything about?

75
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:32,392
Rym: cuz my over-the-air headphones?

76
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:33,275
Scott: No, it's not gonna chew gum.

77
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:38,389
Rym: My over-the-air headphones are really good.

78
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:40,940
Rym: They don't form a complete suction.

79
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,430
Scott: You have hair right above your ear true.

80
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:43,932
Rym: I do have.

81
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:45,740
Rym: I have sideburns and such.

82
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:49,299
Scott: how would how would the headphone form a perfect seal against your?

83
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:56,710
Rym: The side of your head thing is my headphone even though I put it up against a completely flat surface Does not form a suction.

84
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,650
Rym: I can't just like push it in and stick it to the wall Like it'll deflate it'll let air in.

85
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,639
Rym: it's not perfect like grease it up a little bit.

86
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,880
Rym: Uh, I don't know if I want to grease up my fancy headphones.

87
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,867
Rym: Don't feel like it could happen with these headphones.

88
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:11,212
Scott: You have it with the ones I had.

89
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:15,888
Rym: Yeah, I don't know your pet That's are they like a plunger like?

90
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,040
Rym: could you hurt your ear by like compressing them on your head?

91
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,238
Scott: No, I don't think it's like a perfect vacuum cuz like there was.

92
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:23,425
Scott: you know It was just.

93
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:26,100
Scott: I would just break the seal and then it would suddenly work again.

94
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:26,923
Scott: It might.

95
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:30,400
Scott: also I don't know if there's any interaction with the active noise cancelling either.

96
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:38,880
Rym: Maybe that was involved in some way because active noise cancelling could get it if it got into a state where the signal it's using.

97
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:46,600
Rym: To decide to basically make the noise cancelling signal ended up being the input that's coming into the headphone in the first place.

98
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:48,059
Rym: It would cancel itself out.

99
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:53,795
Rym: Yeah That can happen in like regular old podcast audio engineering say.

100
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:59,154
Rym: I record myself on two microphones And for whatever reason the phase of those is 180 degrees.

101
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:00,820
Rym: They'll just cancel out to nothing.

102
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:19,588
Rym: Yep This will commonly happen to people use an OBS to stream who don't know what they're doing and they'll some Stereo inputs to mono and they'll literally end up cancelling out their sound and then they'll see a really tiny volume there and they'll drag the gain up and The road you're on if you're dragging the gate up in that situation.

103
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:24,260
Rym: Oh, no, it goes somewhere filled with screeching agonizing sounds.

104
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:26,450
Rym: It goes somewhere.

105
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:27,299
Rym: it goes to jikoku.

106
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:29,624
Rym: So you got any anime news?

107
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:32,252
Scott: Yeah, I got some little anime news.

108
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:41,170
Scott: It's basically yeah, so first news is that Brian cave on this is the dude who writes saga.

109
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:41,852
Scott: He wrote.

110
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:43,497
Scott: why the good comics he wrote?

111
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:44,540
Scott: why the last man?

112
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,046
Scott: He wrote pride of Baghdad.

113
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:49,173
Scott: He wrote the original runaways.

114
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:49,815
Scott: He wrote.

115
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:51,580
Rym: I kind of just stopped reading saga.

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,929
Rym: I feel like I got a pick it back up ex machina.

117
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,595
Rym: He's still going.

118
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,498
Rym: Oh, it's still going.

119
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:58,590
Rym: Okay I haven't read it in a while.

120
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:02,213
Scott: Oh, yeah, I got all the trades Shaky, which I just catch up.

121
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:07,998
Scott: Oh, yeah, okay It's probably still the best comic that's currently being published in the United States.

122
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:11,432
Scott: next time I'm over there you at United States over there to judge anime.

123
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,173
Rym: I'll pick up the trades where I left off and the.

124
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,147
Scott: Anyway, really good comic book writer.

125
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:18,692
Scott: He's also written other things.

126
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:19,915
Scott: He worked on some TV shows.

127
00:07:19,976 --> 00:07:21,260
Scott: I think whatever he.

128
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:25,740
Scott: Apparently, I don't know this hasn't been confirmed or something, but it's being reported.

129
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:29,312
Scott: But there's gonna be a live-action Gundam movie, which is almost.

130
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,319
Scott: you hear that and you're like well shit show.

131
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:36,519
Scott: Granted, I mean on one hand every lie every like most Gundam stuff is recent is yeah.

132
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:44,400
Scott: On one hand my default random that isn't like just a TV series is definitely gonna be chitchat.

133
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,640
Rym: My default reaction to they're making a live-action of an anime is it's bad.

134
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,671
Rym: But then I was surprised because battle angel Alita was good.

135
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:53,553
Rym: You see it.

136
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:54,817
Rym: I did not see it.

137
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:55,920
Scott: How do you know so?

138
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,616
Rym: Everyone I trust who has seen it has said middling to great reviews.

139
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:02,820
Rym: No one has said it is bad.

140
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:07,280
Scott: So people said about a lot of things that's but I am that is shocking.

141
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:19,447
Scott: The problem is it is yeah The point is the problem is that the flaw of the thing a Gundam things that suck right is Usually the bad writing.

142
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:26,269
Scott: so the fact that they have put an excellent writer on it Means that there is some potential here.

143
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:31,465
Scott: if this is real and it happened the problem is for this Gundam because it's Gundam.

144
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:34,232
Rym: how much leash will Brian gave on have?

145
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:36,860
Scott: how much does Brian cave on know about Gundam?

146
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,504
Scott: Yeah, I imagine he's right watching Gundam right now to get up to speed But what if he'd?

147
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:43,412
Rym: what if no one told him which got him to watch?

148
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:45,319
Rym: what if he's just watching like f90?

149
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:51,720
Scott: Feeling that a dude who has written such comics as ultimate x-men knows what a Gundam is and knows how to watch a gun?

150
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:53,692
Scott: Yeah, I don't think he needs help.

151
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:54,094
Scott: I don't.

152
00:08:54,114 --> 00:09:03,002
Scott: I think he knows how to internet Yeah, but at the same time he might know he might be like how war in the pocket And I'm sure he can ask them for like you know access to any Gundams He needs to see.

153
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,905
Scott: they'll just give them to him.

154
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:06,573
Rym: Let's see tentatively titled mobile suit Gundam.

155
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:09,382
Scott: you see - Right so this would come.

156
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:12,251
Scott: this is a unicorn - so that already is not.

157
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:14,157
Scott: it happens in the universal century.

158
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:20,595
Rym: like you know Original Gundam is a project that would have an quote overseas drama format.

159
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:22,300
Rym: the hell is an overseas drop.

160
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,942
Scott: Well, that's what.

161
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:24,047
Scott: no the for the jet.

162
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:30,229
Scott: the Japanese see it as overseas drama so for them It basically means live-action American thing.

163
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:35,565
Rym: yeah, right because they take place in the UC 0104.

164
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,815
Scott: okay, so if you think about original Gundam is what 78?

165
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:42,191
Scott: yeah 104 is like 30.

166
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:46,055
Rym: I prefer the Gundam seed calendar The cosmic era.

167
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,944
Rym: yeah That was what.

168
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,530
Rym: just gonna see it and gonna see destiny.

169
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,936
Rym: There's nothing else in that one rights.

170
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:51,820
Scott: It's cosmic era.

171
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:53,470
Rym: Yeah, there's nothing else in cosmic era.

172
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,898
Scott: Universal Century is real Gundam.

173
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:55,240
Scott: nothing.

174
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,760
Rym: Nothing happened in that era since what I saw and what I chose it doesn't say seed in the title.

175
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,239
Scott: It didn't happen in the cosmic era.

176
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:08,497
Scott: I mean there's a probably bunch of mangas that happened in the cosmic era that you were never gonna read.

177
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:09,140
Rym: all right cosmic.

178
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,532
Scott: I got a Bunch of manga like astray whatever and yeah, it's just.

179
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:15,736
Rym: it's what I know.

180
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:19,133
Scott: there's nothing new there, right It's all and everything has the word seed in the title.

181
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:23,509
Rym: if it's in cosmic era yep Yeah, bunch of manga side stories.

182
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,815
Scott: Yeah, they're all like.

183
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,860

Scott: Okay, sure okay.

185
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:28,759
Rym: Yeah, anyway.

186
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:37,853
Scott: Second news is Galaxy Express 3 9. one of the best animes there is right my one of my favorite.

187
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:40,220
Scott: Maybe my favorite lazy Matsumoto thing.

188
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:46,617
Rym: Scott likes the slow space drama long shot of someone just walking.

189
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:48,465
Scott: anyway It's the galaxy.

190
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:49,833
Scott: sister 9 is a TV series.

191
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:51,160
Scott: You can still watch it on crunchyroll.

192
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:52,145
Scott: There's movies.

193
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:55,803
Scott: they came out discotheque put them out on DVD ways back Right.

194
00:10:55,883 --> 00:11:18,218
Scott: but recently and here's a Twitter thread of the people who did it they worked real hard To basically redo the movies and put out brand new HD bureaus that are like perfect and amazing better subtitles all kinds of extras included in the burei like you can get a Ticket to ride on the galaxy express in the D. It's like an extra in the DVD box like a little piece of paper, right?

195
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,734
Scott: Really cute to do that.

196
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,507
Scott: So that's pretty amazing.

197
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,880
Scott: I you know you read the thread of the people who did it.

198
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:33,280
Scott: They clearly tried really hard cared a lot did a good job right makes you want to watch them again all redone and stuff.

199
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,754
Scott: But they put it out on burei only.

200
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:42,300
Scott: so I'm like hey I don't never gonna buy a burei in my life where I want to watch it streaming or downloading.

201
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,004
Scott: I'll even pay.

202
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,839
Scott: I'll pay money for this because you you have done great works.

203
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,640
Scott: And this is out now by the way in the United States in English.

204
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,248
Scott: Where can I watch it like go to Amazon Prime.

205
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:54,980
Scott: so good Amazon Prime and I see an Amazon Prime.

206
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,188
Scott: I got the DVD that I already own from discotheque.

207
00:11:57,248 --> 00:12:00,640
Scott: Yeah, I see the burei that was just released for 20 bucks, right?

208
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:09,546
Scott: And it's - it's this two movies this galaxy Express, and then this I do Galaxy Express yep, so it's like two movies anyway I don't know if they did.

209
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:11,635
Scott: there's like another thing that I've never watched.

210
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:18,440
Scott: the third thing That's like something destiny something I forget whatever the point is.

211
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,811
Scott: Or is it Endless Odyssey or something like that?

212
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,178
Scott: I don't know.

213
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:25,466
Scott: I forget I've never seen it doesn't?

214
00:12:25,486 --> 00:12:27,640
Scott: you don't need to see that these two movies are what's important.

215
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,549
Scott: And then I see like watch the movie.

216
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:33,515
Scott: There's multiple prime video links.

217
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:40,960
Scott: Yeah, and one of them Looks like it's clearly based on discotheque because the art is similar to the art.

218
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:42,455
Scott: That's on the DVD and the burei.

219
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,992
Scott: But is it from the new burei?

220
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:52,460
Scott: because if it's from the new burei, then I'll watch it But if it's from the DVD then I'm not gonna watch it cuz I already have the DVD.

221
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,460
Rym: Yeah, we've already seen that a long time ago, right, and it just works.

222
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,510
Scott: It's just like an Amazon Prime thing, but then this is other link to watch the movie that has completely different Artwork on Amazon.

223
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:07,091
Scott: right and if you click on that You can't watch it even if you have Amazon Prime.

224
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:11,926
Scott: It says get viewster anime Included with viewster for some.

225
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:19,908
Scott: what $4 a month a month after a seven-day free trial, but it's like What if this is on Amazon Prime?

226
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:20,450
Scott: Why is it?

227
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,180
Scott: Why is it like this viewster thing going on?

228
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,932
Rym: I never heard of viewster right the head anime.

229
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,869
Rym: Oh wow if I go to viewster calm It's got a fucking broken certificate.

230
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:32,780
Scott: Yeah, okay, okay, but it's like okay.

231
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:35,065
Scott: They got rid of that anime.

232
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,232
Rym: Sorry the CN is like not valid.

233
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:39,440
Scott: they got rid of the anime strike thing.

234
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:41,668
Scott: so what the hell's up with this viewster thing?

235
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:48,000
Scott: and how can I tell if you've got a Movie that's on prime viewster might be compromised?

236
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:48,642
Rym: There's something.

237
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:59,785
Rym: this actually the certificate here for viewster calm is from viewster calm dot something dot simple helix dot net You don't?

238
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,411
Scott: it sounds like they're really bad at the web.

239
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:02,998
Rym: They're either really bad, or they got hacked.

240
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:03,520
Rym: I don't know.

241
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,295
Scott: I think they're just bad.

242
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,897
Scott: Simple helix is probably their hosting company.

243
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:11,052
Scott: they prob That's the certificates bright based on the original hostname not in their DNS.

244
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:13,280
Scott: Yeah, anyway that happens a lot because people are dumb.

245
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:30,176
Scott: The point is I feel like they need to do a better job of telling you when you go to watch something on You know a streaming site or a download place like hey This is ripped from this bure or this DVD or this film or

246
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,138
Rym: but usually they don't.

247
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:31,800
Rym: there's no way to know.

248
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,900
Rym: You'll see multiple streaming options multiple physical options and the streaming options are just the movie.

249
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,110
Rym: They might even all be called the exact same thing.

250
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:39,532
Scott: so it's like.

251
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,100
Scott: I've seen this movie many times.

252
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:46,786
Scott: I only want to rewatch it if I get to see that great new Remastered redone bure version.

253
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:50,460
Rym: and if that period is that other one is eternal fantasy, okay?

254
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,829
Rym: You can buy a DVD in English.

255
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,755
Scott: Yeah, I've never seen it.

256
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:53,863
Scott: It's I wonder I want.

257
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:56,900
Scott: I don't know if they redid that one also or not, and I don't know what happens in it.

258
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,740
Rym: We get a new one for a hundred and ten dollars.

259
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:01,085
Rym: Yeah No Based on the original story by L.A.

260
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:04,496
Rym: Drew Matsumoto picks up one year after the events of ado right.

261
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:11,352
Scott: so if you don't know if You've never seen any Galaxy Express Right the three movies are sort of separate from like.

262
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:13,940
Scott: they don't tell exactly the same story as the TV show.

263
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:15,988
Scott: It's almost like if you had.

264
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,920
Scott: you know this is the original manga, and then it's like all right.

265
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,109
Scott: We'll make it into three movies all right.

266
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,659
Scott: We'll make it into a TV show and they really have like nothing to do.

267
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:28,120
Scott: It's like it's like two separate adaptations that like that.

268
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,329
Scott: It's not like they're inserted or anything right.

269
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,840
Rym: very their experiences in and of themselves.

270
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,927
Scott: Yeah, it's like in the TV show.

271
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:36,794
Scott: Tetsuro is a potato in the movie.

272
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,817
Scott: He is not a potato.

273
00:15:37,998 --> 00:15:40,357
Rym: yep He is such a potato though.

274
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:47,247
Rym: So and the manga is a potato, but this will remember this question of wait How do I watch this?

275
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:48,553
Rym: which one of these do I click on?

276
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,160
Rym: because it's gonna come up again in this episode.

277
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:57,600
Rym: Another interesting news is that Funimation said they're gonna release a Dragon Ball Z blu-ray collector's edition.

278
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:59,959
Scott: So is that all of the original Dragon Ball Z?

279
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:03,835
Rym: Yeah the 30th anniversary collector's edition.

280
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:12,768
Scott: so a full set of blu-rays So you can watch all of Dragon Ball Z. not Dragon Ball not Dragon Ball GT or any other Dragon Ball But just Z every episode.

281
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:20,702
Scott: I believe so original Japanese unedited original music Titles.

282
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:22,408
Rym: they're like changing the aspect ratio.

283
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,519
Rym: there was some debate about four by three or sixteen by nine.

284
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:27,911
Scott: The original last video show is four by three.

285
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:29,579
Scott: I feel like you shouldn't be stretching was it?

286
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:32,718
Rym: Are you sure it was on Japanese television?

287
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:32,980
Rym: Yeah?

288
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,264
Scott: Which is square television.

289
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,590
Rym: Funimation announced they release it.

290
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,040
Rym: the release had planned to keep the four by three aspect ratio.

291
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,898
Rym: Yeah But Funimation only released the first two volumes for suspending production.

292
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:47,560
Rym: on that They said they had to suspend it due to technical challenges of restoring from the original film frame by frame.

293
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:48,985
Rym: It was too expensive.

294
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:49,547
Rym: they gave up.

295
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:56,752
Rym: they later released it on a nine blu-ray disc thing in 2013 But that changed it to a 16 by 9 aspect ratio.

296
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:59,220
Scott: So is it like cropping the top and bottom off of everything?

297
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:01,479
Rym: Hell if I know I don't need to watch Dragon Ball Z again.

298
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:03,365
Rym: Okay, but the news.

299
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:06,114
Scott: even watch Dragon Ball Z to begin with I only see.

300
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:08,099
Scott: I've only seen like a few episodes here and there.

301
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:12,440
Rym: I watched every episode where Krillin is laying on the ground yelling while someone else is fighting.

302
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:16,220
Scott: I've watched episodes where people are up in the air glowing yellow and going.

303
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:20,528
Rym: I saw episodes where Frieza was in them.

304
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:23,275
Scott: Yeah, those are the ones and I never saw.

305
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:24,920
Scott: that's like the white lizard II dude, right?

306
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,340
Scott: Yeah, that's like the Mewtwo, yeah, yeah, it's like I'm not gonna lie.

307
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:30,324
Scott: I haven't seen that.

308
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:36,489
Scott: I've seen maybe less than 20 Dragon Ball Z's and none of them None of those episodes were adjacent to each other.

309
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:42,852
Rym: I saw hunks of Dragon Ball Z because it was on like right before Sailor Moon, which I was watching when Dragon Ball Z was on.

310
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:45,000
Scott: I usually went to a different channel to watch something else.

311
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:47,300
Rym: Yep, usually I'd catch the end of a Dragon Ball Z episode.

312
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:57,159
Scott: Yeah, because I wanted to I usually wanted to watch what was before or after Dragon Ball Z. I think I don't remember exactly but I think it was Dragon Ball Z would end it and then I would watch Vitesse.

313
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:58,143
Scott: I don't remember.

314
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:59,207
Rym: Yeah, I think that was.

315
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:02,260
Rym: it might have been a different era because I remember it was Dragon Ball Z and then Sailor Moon.

316
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:07,585
Scott: Yeah, no Sailor Moon was on like our local but anyway Yeah it depends on when you're watching.

317
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:14,971
Rym: because remember that Sailor Moon R came out and then there was the episodes after the Tree saga that like people hadn't seen in the u.s.

318
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:28,720
Scott: On Toonami at the beginning of Toonami I would watch the old shows the thundar the barbarian and the Voltron and then I would stop watching when it was the Tenchi Dragon Ball zone in the middle and then I would come back after dinner for B-TAS and other stuff.

319
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,305
Rym: I didn't watch Tenchi because I'd already seen every Tenchi by then Fucking fansubs of Tenchi.

320
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:38,374
Rym: Yeah, so that was Tenchi was a show.

321
00:18:38,394 --> 00:18:40,140
Rym: I was really into in like high school.

322
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:45,176
Rym: Yeah, I was even reading that pretty bad manga with like yakage or whatever.

323
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:46,399
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what that is.

324
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:51,500
Rym: It's the villain who's pretty remarkably similar to the villain in the villain in the second OAV.

325
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:55,580
Scott: I only know what Tenchi looks like and what the girl with the big blue hair looks like and that's it.

326
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,692
Scott: I don't know any other characters.

327
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:00,032
Rym: Was it the one who seemed kind of evil?

328
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:00,514
Rym: Yes.

329
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:01,057
Rym: Yeah, that was.

330
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:01,640
Rym: that's the good one.

331
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:02,323
Scott: That's the only.

332
00:19:02,363 --> 00:19:03,710
Scott: I was the only characters I know from that show.

333
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,800
Rym: There's another girl with big blue hair who was different.

334
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:09,720
Rym: So if I see those characters, there's a third character with big blue hair who was different still.

335
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:12,373
Scott: Oh, I know and that's the girl who's technically way too old, right?

336
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:15,040
Rym: Yeah, Sasami That's the other girl with blue hair.

337
00:19:15,462 --> 00:19:16,024
Scott: It was the only.

338
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:19,216
Scott: and those the only things that I will recognize and say that's Tenchi.

339
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:20,782
Scott: if I don't see any of those Things I don't know.

340
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:21,063
Scott: It's ten.

341
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,932
Rym: You'd probably recognize the little cat thing.

342
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:25,838
Rym: Maybe like the Cabot half rat rabbit.

343
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,875
Rym: That's from that show, but technically she is a spaceship.

344
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,566
Rym: So okay Also, she also tries to bone Tenchi.

345
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:35,188
Scott: Okay.

346
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,575
Rym: Anyway, the news is not.

347
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:39,160
Rym: I don't get anything to say about Dragon Ball.

348
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:47,250
Rym: The news is that Funimation said they're only gonna even make This collector's edition if they get 2,500 pre-orders.

349
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,715
Rym: I'm sure they'll get 2,500 pre-orders.

350
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,391
Rym: Yeah I think that's.

351
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:52,240
Scott: I saw a lot of nerds.

352
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,220
Scott: It makes sense cuz like there's not too much demand for this and clearly it's a pain in the ass for them to make it.

353
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:58,825
Scott: Dragon Ball Z is a lot of work.

354
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:00,070
Scott: There's a lot of episodes.

355
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,853
Scott: Yeah, right.

356
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,920
Scott: It's like it seems seems like a lot of work.

357
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:07,235
Scott: I feel like you wouldn't do it unless you knew for sure you had that enough nerds.

358
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,580
Scott: That's not a very large number.

359
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,332
Scott: I feel like there's definitely enough Dragon Ball fans.

360
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:11,117
Scott: They'll meet the number.

361
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:17,805
Rym: Yep so they pointedly said they're not gonna do like a Kickstarter or something because They don't want to just like.

362
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:20,595
Rym: like that would be asking fans to fund new content.

363
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:21,117
Scott: Yeah, that's through.

364
00:20:21,157 --> 00:20:21,900
Scott: now just do pre-orders.

365
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,193
Scott: Yeah, just like until there's enough pre-orders.

366
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:28,652
Rym: We won't start working on it Yeah, which I think more companies should do for this kind of thing.

367
00:20:28,673 --> 00:20:29,215
Rym: This is great.

368
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:30,560
Scott: You don't have to pay a fee to Kickstarter.

369
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,736
Scott: So someone's claiming there's a problem with this.

370
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:33,179
Scott: They're mad.

371
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:40,869
Rym: The people I saw who seemed to be mad about this seem to be people who are best ignored in all cases in all things.

372
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:46,000
Scott: in all cases I mean, I seem to remember the exact same thing happening or a similar thing.

373
00:20:46,324 --> 00:21:04,332
Scott: I could be wrong about this But I remember when I bought the Macross DVDs from anime ego way back in the early 2000s You know, I pre-ordered those for like $300 Of 2000s money when I was pouring in college, but I had to order that anyway, which is I don't regret that I still have those.

374
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:05,020
Rym: I remember that.

375
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,700
Scott: Well, I mean up until then there was no no way to get that right.

376
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:11,910
Rym: There wasn't even like YouTube.

377
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:12,635
Scott: Right?

378
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:13,320
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

379
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:20,640
Scott: And I seem to remember them like not having I could be wrong but a vague, you know, 20 year old memory.

380
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:29,562
Scott: But I seem to remember them like having I got a number and like if they didn't get that many then they wouldn't Wouldn't like, you know do it God What was?

381
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:30,186
Rym: I don't.

382
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:33,000
Scott: or maybe that was just the number of that they were gonna make.

383
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,747
Scott: They would sell out.

384
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:36,857
Scott: Yeah, I can't remember which one it was.

385
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:37,580
Rym: I have no idea.

386
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:42,160
Rym: That was so long ago that that was such a different era of reality from today.

387
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,882
Scott: That's what.

388
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:48,020
Scott: I kept all the discs, but and I ripped I think all the discs to digital.

389
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,245
Scott: But I still have them.

390
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:52,920
Scott: and but I I kept all the there's like there was like liner notes.

391
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:53,486
Scott: They came with.

392
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:54,173
Scott: I kept those.

393
00:21:54,214 --> 00:22:00,460
Scott: they were fancy Yeah, but all the DVD boxes and the the cardboard box that they all went in I got rid of that.

394
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:02,480
Rym: Yeah, I ended up getting rid of too much space.

395
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,540
Rym: I got rid of every cardboard box for every DVD I own and put them in sleeves.

396
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:12,330
Rym: But now I have a two inch thick binder of sleeves with a shit ton of DVDs That I feel like I should just rip and then throw away.

397
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:14,680
Scott: I just keep it, you know in a place.

398
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:15,600
Rym: I keep it in a place.

399
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:24,735
Rym: But I feel like it might be worth it to just set up a PC and just Script it where I just put a DVD and it just rips it and puts it on the NAS Rip every DVD I own and just get rid of the last of them and

400
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:27,750
Scott: some of those DVDs I feel like I need like my Windows 95 B CD.

401
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:34,052
Rym: Yeah I'm only talking about my moon-based commander CD wrong.

402
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:35,577
Rym: I mean, I have my tribes to see these.

404
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:41,572
Scott: don't have that.

405
00:22:41,913 --> 00:22:42,555
Scott: I got the code.

406
00:22:43,498 --> 00:22:44,060
Scott: I don't have the joke.

407
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:46,045
Rym: I've also got that too.

408
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:47,891
Scott: I'm a career to CD room.

412
00:23:06,113 --> 00:23:06,654
Rym: I still have that CD.

413
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,620
Rym: Maybe I should put all those on YouTube if they're not there.

414
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:19,778
Rym: But first things of the day, what do you got?

415
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,671
Scott: What do I got?

416
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,199
Rym: All right.

417
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:25,050
Scott: So if you don't know who Fritz Lang is you got problem.

418
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:32,720
Scott: Fritz Lang is like one of the best movie directors there ever was Directed such great famous films like metropolis like the original one.

419
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:39,179
Scott: Yeah M just the letter M that's the name of the movie when the greatest movies there is and a movie I've more recently just.

420
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,122
Scott: I mean Not.

421
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:42,350
Scott: I mean not saying I personally discovered this movie.

422
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,899
Scott: I'm saying other people knew about this movie.

423
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:47,827
Scott: clearly I didn't know about it until maybe like a year ago.

424
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:49,552
Scott: the testament of dr.

425
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:52,240
Scott: Mabu is a which is like amazing this movie.

426
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:55,103
Rym: Oh, yeah, you mentioned that I didn't watch Series.

427
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,230
Scott: of three movies one was made in the late 20s.

428
00:23:57,611 --> 00:24:02,096
Scott: the one that I saw was made in like the early 30s And then there was a third one that was made in like that 60s.

429
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,760
Scott: I only saw the middle one and it was amazing.

430
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:08,440
Scott: He's also made a lot of other very very famous amazing movies.

431
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:12,698
Scott: not a lot of them are listed on this page not all of which I've seen because it's hard to see them.

432
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:24,571
Scott: but Fritz Lang was famous for not being interviewed very often because he said look if your artwork Doesn't speak for itself and you need to give like an interview to explain your work You didn't do a very good job.

433
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:24,895
Scott: Did you?

434
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,420
Scott: Right.

435
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:27,827
Scott: That was his philosophy, right?

436
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:29,072
Rym: So he did that philosophy, right?

437
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:32,354
Scott: He wasn't about trying to make himself famous He was about trying to just make movies.

438
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:35,278
Scott: So There weren't a lot of interviews with him.

439
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:38,410
Scott: maybe there was only one and there was this.

440
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:52,552
Scott: basically there was this one interview with him ever and and I think no one had seen this interview or you know the contents of it until like early 2000s and I Remember seeing it around then and it wasn't.

441
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:53,115
Scott: it was like.

442
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:54,360
Scott: it wasn't the whole thing.

443
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,897
Scott: It was like just a portion right and now in 2019 15 years later.

444
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:00,860
Scott: It's like, all right.

445
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:04,710
Scott: Here's the whole the transcript of the whole interview the whole thing.

446
00:25:05,252 --> 00:25:10,806
Scott: So this is pretty much all you're gonna get Is long.

447
00:25:11,068 --> 00:25:11,570
Rym: I'm gonna read this.

448
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:22,168
Scott: it's pretty much like the only time Fritz Lang ever sat down and talked to anyone on the record that it was recorded While skimming these already Comparing him to say Kunihiko Ikuhara.

449
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:25,360
Rym: He gives the exact opposite kind of answer.

450
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:29,300
Rym: Oh, yeah, Ikuhara would be like you'd have to ask Toga.

451
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:35,744
Rym: There's no way for me to answer that question because I can't speak for Toga Fritz Lang here.

452
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:38,217
Rym: It's just like if the movie didn't say it like what do you want?

453
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:45,328
Rym: Hey Yeah, I Don't know what he's got a Monica.

454
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,051
Rym: I don't know.

455
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:47,317
Rym: That's a real good picture.

456
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,371
Scott: Yeah exactly what you expect him to look like.

457
00:25:50,512 --> 00:25:59,640
Rym: yep, so If you like all good sane people read the first do novel possibly because you know, it's a classic of all time.

458
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,929
Rym: I didn't read it until recently both of us.

459
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:02,652
Rym: We did a book club.

460
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:04,560
Scott: I tried to read it in middle school and did not like.

461
00:26:05,441 --> 00:26:07,731
Scott: Yeah, I'm still only you know, it's I.

462
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:15,433
Rym: I like it a lot but Unlike every other but like many of its ideas every other book club book.

463
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,035
Scott: We're not all.

464
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:17,439
Rym: yeah, not all the games.

465
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:17,640
Scott: better.

466
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:24,451
Rym: yeah, some of the ideas that had were just a product of their time and a Could be done better shall we say.

467
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:27,710
Scott: but everything I've heard about the other dune books I haven't read has been bad.

468
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,616
Scott: So I'm not gonna read them.

469
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:37,478
Rym: Yep I think someone did I someone in our forum described the further dune books as a train wreck that you want to look away from But you just can't and you have to.

470
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:38,965
Rym: yes I can I don't.

471
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:42,440
Rym: I'm not force yourself to look away and go read a newspaper the next day instead.

472
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,585
Scott: I have not looked at it.

473
00:26:43,907 --> 00:26:45,595
Scott: I haven't had to force myself anything.

474
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:55,460
Rym: It is telling that There's a trend in the gig nights book club where we read the first book of a series and then I just go on and Read the entire wheel of time after that like just instantly.

475
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:58,237
Rym: I did not read any more dune books after we did dune.

476
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:01,860
Rym: I feel like dune ended at a place where I did not need more dune.

477
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:10,189
Rym: But if you are the kind of person who wants to know what happened in the dune universe But is smart enough to not read all the dune books.

478
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:12,116
Rym: Here's a 10-minute YouTube video.

479
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:13,180
Scott: No only 10 minutes.

480
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:15,740
Scott: When you say I saw you were choosing this is a thing of your day.

481
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,226
Scott: I'm like, I am NOT watching this but now that I know it's only 10 minutes It's like I got 10 minutes.

482
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:24,684
Rym: and what it does is it doesn't just go through the books It's actually much broader.

483
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:26,649
Rym: It just takes from all the books.

484
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:30,400
Rym: What is the entire chronological order of events?

485
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:37,140
Rym: from the beginning of Anything mentioned in the series beginning of time well to the Roman Empire.

486
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:40,231
Rym: That's when that's the earliest thing that happens in dune.

487
00:27:40,352 --> 00:27:42,600
Rym: Okay happens in the Roman Empire.

488
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:43,704
Scott: That's news to me.

489
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:44,347
Scott: But all right.

490
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:50,891
Rym: Yep, and this just moves along and covers the 34,000 years of the dune universe.

491
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:53,060
Rym: the Butlerian Jihad is like right away.

492
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:55,907
Scott: Okay, so the Roman part isn't a lot of content.

493
00:27:56,228 --> 00:28:00,880
Rym: No, the Rome part is yeah Rome then the Land Strad in space.

494
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:06,680
Scott: Okay Only because none of the time in between was covered in any of the books.

495
00:28:06,883 --> 00:28:07,757
Scott: So there's nothing to say about.

496
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:11,130
Rym: yeah It'd be like if I was covering human history and I was like so.

497
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:17,293
Rym: a monolith fell down then monkeys discovered warfare Then World War two happens moon landing.

498
00:28:17,935 --> 00:28:20,763
Scott: So that brings us to things Met a moment.

499
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:21,065
Scott: Yep.

500
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:24,598
Rym: So the meta moment the GeekNights book club book is 2001 a space Odyssey.

501
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,257
Scott: I finished reading it for Thursday, but then Rym bailed and didn't finish reading it.

502
00:28:29,478 --> 00:28:29,960
Scott: He's bad.

503
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:34,140
Rym: I will be done with this book because I've been mostly done with it as of now.

504
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:36,811
Scott: Guess what next Thursday when we do an episode on it.

505
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,840
Scott: We're doing that episode whether you read it or not.

506
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:39,923
Rym: Yeah, fine.

507
00:28:40,204 --> 00:28:54,517
Rym: The funniest thing about this book so far because I'm near the end is Every time a character talks about it mostly happens only in the first half of the book the price of something Like oh that was it.

508
00:28:54,557 --> 00:28:55,865
Rym: That's a $50,000 person we invested in.

509
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:56,649
Rym: it's really funny.

510
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:04,843
Scott: But I mean, it's not funny enough that it's 2001.

511
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,314
Scott: Everything in it still seems futuristic even though it's currently 2019.

512
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:12,936
Rym: Yeah Well everything in it feels futuristic except information technology and the book is from like the 60s.

513
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:14,402
Rym: Yeah It's.

514
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:23,967
Scott: this is another thought cuz I mean if you look at the the rate of space technology Progression that was happening at that time right pre Person on moon time.

515
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:27,239
Rym: Yep, like before we kind of paused that work, right?

516
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:29,769
Scott: They saw the space race.

517
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:32,000
Scott: It's accelerating and they projected forward.

518
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,730
Scott: He's like, well, we keep developing our space technology at the rate We're doing it now, you know that we should be.

519
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,521
Scott: this is what the kind of stuff we'll have by 2001.

520
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:42,276
Scott: We should be going to Jupiter and Saturn Rym only make sense.

521
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:48,556
Scott: Yeah Typewriters didn't foresee that we would space shuttle and then not even space shuttle.

522
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:52,679
Rym: We still got casual sexism and typewriters.

523
00:29:55,564 --> 00:30:01,206
Rym: So, yeah Otherwise, we will be in Two weeks three weeks three weeks.

524
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:04,737
Rym: Well two weeks at zenk icon GeekNights will be doing panels.

525
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:16,465
Rym: I still have to Remember to look up what panels I'm doing So I know to prepare them and to show up for them and I have to repair the panel for PAX East the week after Yeah, but PAX East on Friday.

526
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:19,980
Rym: We will be doing the real harm of games.

527
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:24,010
Rym: What harm did people tell us games would do that?

528
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,153
Rym: They may or may not have done.

529
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,198
Scott: and what harm do games do?

530
00:30:27,218 --> 00:30:32,039
Rym: Yep, and The answers may surprise you they may shock and alarm you.

531
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:35,720
Scott: Yeah, I had what I wanted to say, but then I found that I was wrong.

532
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,048
Scott: It's not changing what I'm gonna say.

533
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:39,923
Rym: Holy shit GeekNights panel that Research.

534
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:42,672
Scott: usually it's come up with my ten minutes of research.

535
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,240
Rym: Usually our panel structure is come up with an idea.

536
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:56,580
Rym: Do come up with the thesis that we're going to present then cherry-pick evidence cherry-pick evidence and find all the images We need and all the things to talk about it and then we're good.

537
00:30:56,861 --> 00:31:00,614
Rym: But in this case, it was come up with the thesis then do research then.

538
00:31:00,634 --> 00:31:01,477
Rym: Oh shit.

539
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:02,460
Rym: Our topic is now.

540
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,032
Scott: Oh, no, I couldn't even find any evidence that I agree with.

541
00:31:06,172 --> 00:31:06,574
Scott: Oh, no.

542
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:08,380
Scott: Yeah, I guess I'll change my thesis.

543
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:09,246
Rym: I guess I got.

544
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:11,199
Rym: I guess I gotta change my world view.

545
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:12,002
Scott: I can't.

546
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:12,986
Scott: I can't.

547
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:16,500
Rym: I can't just say the games don't cause the panels already been accepted.

548
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:17,965
Scott: Oops, I guess I can't.

549
00:31:18,005 --> 00:31:19,510
Scott: I can't do a different panel.

550
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,132
Rym: short answer.

551
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:25,854
Rym: games do and have caused harm But it is as far as we can tell not the harm.

552
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:28,392
Rym: Anyone said it was Pretty much.

553
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:32,111
Rym: Yeah You'll see it's gonna be a good panel brand new panel.

554
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:33,618
Rym: So we're excited about it real fan.

555
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:38,873
Scott: Yep And you know that Grimm's panel do it, you know, clickbait for top 40 list.

556
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:41,239
Rym: Well top 40 list is a pretty popular panel.

557
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:52,440
Rym: Clickbait not real because I think what someone impact said that was interesting is the the clickbait title panel.

558
00:31:52,821 --> 00:32:04,054
Rym: That tricks people into a more serious discussion like people come to the panel who wouldn't otherwise come and oh shit It's actually serious or it's actually the real harm of games is click baity enough.

559
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:05,900
Scott: Yeah, it's click baity and it's right.

560
00:32:06,502 --> 00:32:09,777
Scott: You're gonna need you're gonna need someone to save you a click and tell you what the harms were.

561
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:16,119
Rym: Yeah But our nostalgia first game design panel was very well received and I haven't uploaded all the top 40 lists.

562
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:16,762
Rym: We've done.

563
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:18,250
Rym: I gotta edit one of those together.

564
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:20,120
Rym: The board game one is pretty popular.

565
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,599
Rym: Actually, my co-workers have all been looking at that one because they all want to play better games.

566
00:32:24,783 --> 00:32:25,185
Rym: All right.

567
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:25,868
Rym: Here we go.

568
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:32,740
Rym: Let me close this nonsense about the cosmic era because The more I learn about the cosmic era the less I care about the cosmic era.

569
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:39,318
Scott: You may know, uh Tomohiko Morimi is someone who we've talked about a lot recently.

570
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:49,360
Rym: Yep So it's one of those authors where you see a bunch of media and then later you find out there's a creator that is related To all of them and you've like you find a thread and you start tugging on right?

571
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,965
Scott: So there's been a bunch of anime right eccentric family.

572
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:56,654
Scott: Yep, eccentric family - yep night on Night is young walk on girl.

573
00:32:56,815 --> 00:33:01,070
Scott: Yep Tommy galaxy - Tommy galaxy, which we're gonna talk about now.

574
00:33:01,592 --> 00:33:02,976
Scott: Wasn't there another one penguin highway?

575
00:33:02,996 --> 00:33:04,540
Scott: That's coming soon, right?

576
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:04,820
Scott: Yep.

577
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:08,066
Rym: Anyway, we've seen anime was written in 2010.

578
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:14,940
Scott: We've seen anime based on all these things and Some of those anime have been animated by the same teams, right?

579
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:29,920
Scott: So like Masaki Yuasa, he animated what we're gonna talk about today, which is Tommy galaxy on the galaxy, but also he did walk on girl, which is Very related but also not an eccentric family eccentric family - obviously animated by the same studio.

580
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,853
Rym: I just want to point out if you haven't watched eccentric family.

581
00:33:34,274 --> 00:33:35,418
Rym: We reviewed both seasons.

582
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:36,100
Rym: You should go watch it.

583
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,518
Rym: It's one of the best shows to come out.

584
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:41,094
Rym: It is one of the best anime there is right now.

585
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:55,560
Scott: frog in a well anyway But all of these are based on novels written by Tomohiko Morimi and Hopefully these novels will be just translated so I can read them directly and not just have to watch anime adaptations.

586
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:01,140
Scott: I really want to read the eccentric family novel based on all these anime adaptations of Morimi's work.

587
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:06,228
Scott: I am a fan of Morimi's work indirectly indirect key.

588
00:34:06,248 --> 00:34:11,630
Scott: so once I found out because we were when we saw Night a short walk on girl in the theater at the end.

589
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,420
Scott: There's the interview with Yuasa.

590
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:18,408
Scott: He kept bringing up Talking about the time a galaxy and I'm like.

591
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:21,940
Scott: I've heard of tatami galaxy and I haven't watched it.

592
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:23,768
Scott: I think I will go home and watch it.

593
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:26,600
Scott: So I did and I watched like a handful of episodes.

594
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,728
Rym: I've seen like three and a quarter episode.

595
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:29,953
Scott: I've seen a similar amount.

596
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:40,117
Scott: I'd have to you know, and I haven't finished it, but I've definitely done enough to talk about right because I mean That's more than we usually talk about anime watching less episodes than yep.

597
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:41,862
Rym: Basically, it's we.

598
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:47,858
Rym: either we talk about an anime scene a few episodes or we watch the whole thing as fast as possible And then we talked about it, right?

599
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,080
Scott: The only reason I didn't watch this as fast as possible is because I had so many other things to do.

600
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,634
Scott: It's like it, you know, it was con season.

601
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:56,580
Rym: We had a lot of conventions.

602
00:34:56,781 --> 00:35:07,057
Scott: It's like there's other things that kept taking up my time So I couldn't just sit down and watch a whole bunch of anime But every time I got a chance I like squeezed in one episode I only just got like four or five chances.

603
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:13,104
Scott: Yep And now when I want to watch even more of it because I was like, oh, let me go refresh We're gonna do an episode.

604
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:16,156
Scott: I go in crunchyroll and Rym message me today.

605
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:17,120
Scott: He's like, yeah, it ain't there.

606
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,875
Rym: Yep, cuz last night I was like, I've only seen like three episodes.

607
00:35:21,116 --> 00:35:21,799
Rym: I should watch a bunch.

608
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:22,879
Rym: tonight I go to crunchyroll.

609
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:28,260
Rym: Just couldn't find it and I googled around a little bit and I could not find anywhere to watch it legally.

610
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:37,990
Scott: Yeah, if I would have known it was gonna go off crunchyroll I would have like bailed on something else to watch it before I got taken off and now I'm gonna have to Resort to like piracy or something to watch the rest of the show.

611
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:55,958
Rym: Yep, and I really like it's I. There might be a place to watch it legally, but in a cursory search I was not able to find it and in this day and age if you can't find the legal place to watch it by typing The name of it into Google everyone involved has failed and you can pirate it at that point,

612
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:56,280
Scott: right?

613
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,752
Rym: But so actually it says availability.

614
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,000
Rym: I think it got taken down.

615
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:09,938
Scott: Sorry due to licensing limitations videos are unavailable in your region All right, so they just I guess the US distribution thing expired maybe whatever.

616
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:16,560
Rym: Yep So that was a shame because I really like this show and I want to watch the rest of it I feel like I'm gonna have to pirate it right.

617
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:23,920
Scott: So the thing is like I said when we were talking about Even though I hadn't watched all this and still haven't watched all of it Like I said, we were talking about walk on girl.

618
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:34,134
Scott: I've said man, you know because I watched a couple episodes of this before we did our walk on girl episode I was like man, you got you it's hard to talk about walk on girl the anime if you haven't seen the time.

619
00:36:34,154 --> 00:36:57,591
Scott: the galaxy the anime because Both by you also both based on works from the same author but what you also does here the most notable thing is Similar to Tezuka manga where he'll have the same Characters playing the same quote actors playing different act characters in different things The same exact character designs and maybe even voices.

620
00:36:57,611 --> 00:36:58,935
Scott: I have to go verify that.

621
00:36:59,095 --> 00:36:59,697
Rym: I didn't verify.

622
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:03,127
Scott: I didn't verify the voices But there was no disjointedness.

623
00:37:03,168 --> 00:37:05,134
Scott: So I feel like it's the same voices.

624
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:07,060
Scott: It's 100% the same character design.

625
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:14,089
Rym: yep, so in walk on girl in both right in walk on girl, there's a dude who is 0.1 steps above being a bum.

626
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:20,149
Rym: Yep, who may or may not Be a magical creature may not.

627
00:37:20,169 --> 00:37:21,634
Scott: he's Tengu adjacent.

628
00:37:21,694 --> 00:37:23,320
Scott: Yeah, he's got like a big old chin.

629
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:27,580
Rym: Yep, he might just be a bum who through who acts like he's a Tengu, right?

630
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,323
Rym: He might actually be a Tengu.

631
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:31,266
Rym: But anyway, there's a tatami galaxy.

632
00:37:31,386 --> 00:37:31,567
Scott: there.

633
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:36,467
Rym: that person plays someone who's 0.2 steps above being a bum right?

634
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,960
Rym: It's a very similar character who is probably a god.

635
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:48,040
Scott: Yeah You can imagine an eccentric family that you could tell eccentric family with that same character being the Tengu grandpa guy.

636
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,027
Rym: Oh my god that character could you only older.

637
00:37:51,408 --> 00:37:59,091
Rym: if you saw any character from eccentric family or tatami galaxy or walk-on girl In the background of the other shows, it just makes sense.

638
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,255
Rym: They're all in the same universe.

639
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:03,675
Scott: for example eccentric family There's the girl who's always like turning into objects.

640
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:04,259
Scott: You never see her.

641
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,504
Scott: yeah, that could be.

642
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:12,936
Scott: you could use the character design for the girl from walk-on girl or The girl in tatami galaxy for that character.

643
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:19,719
Scott: Yep, right You know main guy in eccentric family main tanuki guy could be main college dude from right, right?

644
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:30,118
Scott: It's like you can see that the author sort of has you know characters that feel similar adjacent ish personalities and roles in their stories.

645
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:37,120
Scott: and Because the same animation team did you know these two anime the time of galaxy and walk-on girl?

646
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,593
Scott: They use the same character designs, right?

647
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:48,737
Scott: There's like devil II guy You know, yeah definitely guy bum buff, dude Buff jock dude earnest male protagonist.

648
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:57,399
Scott: Yep There's a lot of reused character designs from both and the characters that share the designs share personalities quite a bit.

649
00:38:58,281 --> 00:39:01,329
Scott: Anyway, so what's the time in galaxy actually freaking about?

650
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:07,876
Scott: so there's this dude and he is looking to have like the perfect Most wonderful college existed.

651
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:08,500
Rym: Yeah, what does he say?

652
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,433
Rym: He wants to go to college and find a raven-haired girlfriend, right?

653
00:39:12,874 --> 00:39:14,580
Scott: So he's got these ideas about college.

654
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:16,772
Scott: He wants college to be like amazing.

655
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,380
Scott: He's he goes to college.

656
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,211
Scott: He's trying to fulfill his dream of you know, what's gonna happen in college.

657
00:39:22,231 --> 00:39:25,018
Scott: So each episode it's an episodic show.

658
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,940
Scott: surprisingly Yeah, I'm sure it's not episodic at the end, but it's episodic at least most of the way.

659
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:32,373
Scott: I've read some like episode descriptions.

660
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:35,889
Scott: each episode He joins a club at the college.

661
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,777
Scott: So this is my favorite so far.

662
00:39:37,817 --> 00:39:38,620
Scott: is the bicycling club?

663
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:44,091
Scott: Yeah, the bike one's good because of how badly it goes Right, but there's other clubs.

664
00:39:44,112 --> 00:39:46,000
Scott: He joins like a drama club, right was one of them.

665
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,613
Rym: I think the first three episodes are tennis club a film club film club.

666
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:51,038
Rym: Remember with the pervert guy, right?

667
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:56,925
Scott: Right, right yeah, anyway, each episode he joins a different club and Crazy stuff happens

668
00:39:57,346 --> 00:39:59,593
Rym: but all in like the same circle like but

669
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:00,375
Scott: the girl

670
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:05,677
Rym: he likes that he Can't talk to is like in the club or right here by

671
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:12,200
Scott: the same Each even though each episode is different in terms of the club he joins and the exact drama that happens.

672
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:26,724
Scott: There's the same format of how the episode breaks down right early and he makes a promise to this girl right and then he's got her like little thing hanging from the from the Pole string on.

673
00:40:26,764 --> 00:40:30,840
Scott: his land is low and is thick right and he can't remember to give it back to her.

674
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,612
Scott: You know even though she has the rest of the set he has the.

675
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,758
Scott: he is the one that she's missing.

676
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:40,440
Scott: and Then there's the evil dude comes and makes mischief which looks like a demon.

677
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:50,430
Scott: Yeah, he mess up the clean messes up the club's business right the crazy old Tengu adjacent guy Gets in the who is the best and my favorite character.

678
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:52,496
Scott: Yeah the most Rym like character.

679
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,463
Rym: Yeah, it's a very Rym adjacent I love.

680
00:40:54,684 --> 00:41:08,580
Rym: so the description of him in the in this Wikipedia is And it is similar how he's described in the show an eighth-year super senior Mm-hmm, very similar to some people we knew in college ourselves who were still around.

681
00:41:09,921 --> 00:41:26,158
Scott: Maybe what point one steps above being a homeless bum somehow still in the school Yeah, but anyway, and I guess you know that character that Tengu ish character is sort of like the mentor master Ish in a way like he's learning from him sort of.

682
00:41:26,379 --> 00:41:26,540
Scott: anyway.

683
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:32,100
Rym: I mean the vague gist of it is he sort of gives this ultimatum to the main guy of yo, I'm a god, right?

684
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:36,862
Rym: You're either I'm gonna have you date this girl or that shithead, you know And don't like.

685
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:38,630
Rym: but you're also best friends with dater, right?

686
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:42,968
Scott: So the episode, you know as he joins the club He's you know, he's trying to do stuff in the club.

687
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:45,057
Scott: He's usually bad at whatever the club is.

688
00:41:45,077 --> 00:41:46,829
Scott: He's bad at biking He's bad at filming.

689
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:47,980
Scott: He's not helping much, right?

690
00:41:48,361 --> 00:41:49,223
Scott: He's sort of failing.

691
00:41:49,243 --> 00:42:05,848
Scott: and then you know as things are sort of collapsing because of his failure despite his attempts to succeed in his You know devolving into making mischief instead of participating and being nice and doing a job like the first episode He bumps into the fortune-teller.

692
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:06,551
Rym: Yep.

693
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:14,867
Rym: I think the first every time I'm pretty sure the fortune-teller Raised her price every episode.

694
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:18,940
Scott: I didn't notice the fortune-telling part is like usually identical every episode.

695
00:42:19,021 --> 00:42:27,780
Scott: She says basically the same thing right, yeah every time He feels like he remembers this fortune-teller, but he doesn't do what she says.

696
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:30,150
Scott: He doesn't do what the fortune-teller says does what else.

697
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,114
Rym: who says instead?

698
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:35,296
Scott: then the whole thing Collapses in a giant climax clusterfuck.

699
00:42:35,316 --> 00:42:36,278
Scott: That's amazing Yep.

700
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:39,386
Scott: and then There's the end of the show.

701
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:49,540
Scott: at the end of the episode happens and the end of the episode is this animation of like time Rewinding and then the next episode it's like he's back at the beginning of college again.

702
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,711
Scott: So he's replaying sort of a Groundhog Day situation Trying to live this perfect college life.

703
00:42:56,455 --> 00:43:04,030
Scott: and even though it's each episode He's joining a different club and things are a little different getting a little crazier a little more Twisted a little more advanced.

704
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,350
Scott: each time you feel like with each episode He's getting closer to not fucking up.

705
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:20,640
Scott: Yep, so far at least in the for, you know I imagine he's not gonna figure it out to the last episode, but You know for the four or five episodes I've seen it's pretty the same structure just different clubs every time.

706
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:26,595
Scott: But it's it's still Fascinating and I can imagine you can just imagine that at the end.

707
00:43:26,635 --> 00:43:29,970
Scott: He's finally gonna get it, right Yep, but what is right?

708
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,760
Rym: What is a perfect college experience?

709
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,572
Scott: Remembering the thing he's forgetting you're doing with the fortune teller says to do because

710
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:40,519
Rym: not to spoil walk-on girl Which has a similar story in some ways

711
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:42,061
Scott: It

712
00:43:42,523 --> 00:43:58,598
Rym: sort of has this moral of like your rose-colored glasses of what you wanted versus what you actually wanted versus the complexities of a real world and what actually happens all set to the backdrop of All the kinds of crazy people and crap that happens in college.

713
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:04,821
Scott: Yep So the structure of you know, like walk-on girl isn't doing the time rewinding thing It's the.

714
00:44:04,962 --> 00:44:07,690
Scott: it's it's this four seasons thing.

715
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:11,180
Scott: this four seasons that play out in one night is the structure.

716
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:19,765
Scott: so here it's a similar thing where there is a time based structure of College playing out and rewinding Right.

717
00:44:20,267 --> 00:44:23,380
Scott: So I you know, I guess eccentric family doesn't have this structure.

718
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:42,255
Rym: But the two novels that Yuasa Adapted have some sort of you know time based thing going on, but I guess this and walk-on girl both Really really capture this vague nostalgic feeling I have for my own college life.

719
00:44:42,315 --> 00:44:52,660
Rym: and like RIT anime and like that Kind of environment where everything feels bigger and more important than a walk-on girl Also did have a college with a club that was significant, right?

720
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,919
Rym: In the sense of like you see people in clubs who were treating it like it's way more important than it really is.

721
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,209
Scott: Which also makes you think of you know, Utena.

722
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,800
Rym: Yep, but then you see the people post-college.

723
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,429
Rym: Reminiscing on that makes you think of Mahotsukaita.

724
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,158
Scott: Yep, or any of the other anime with clubs.

725
00:45:09,379 --> 00:45:10,073
Scott: Yeah El Hazzard?

726
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:13,912
Rym: Nah, El Hazzard just turns into Escaflowne.

727
00:45:13,972 --> 00:45:15,740
Scott: El Hazzard was just a weird thing in the basement, right?

728
00:45:15,941 --> 00:45:17,907
Rym: Yep, El Hazzard doesn't really get back.

729
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:21,138
Rym: El Hazzard, the good ol' EV, not the TV show.

730
00:45:21,158 --> 00:45:21,680
Rym: that's bad.

731
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,891
Scott: I'm just trying to remember animes that have school clubs.

732
00:45:24,273 --> 00:45:27,908
Scott: Yeah, but the one The one I didn't watch all of Haruhi.

733
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:29,253
Rym: Oh, yeah, Haruhi.

734
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,080
Rym: Haruhi does some stuff.

735
00:45:31,822 --> 00:45:34,973
Scott: Anyway, also a time-based situation, right?

736
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:40,171
Rym: Where this one fits more with Utena Is these more ideas of the thing?

737
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:53,580
Rym: the way you see the world when you're in college Is very different from the way you see it outside of college and you overestimate the importance and the grandeur and scale of the things you're doing and the people around you like.

738
00:45:54,163 --> 00:45:56,760
Scott: You see these legends when your world is small, right?

739
00:45:57,161 --> 00:46:04,710
Scott: Your pond is small that lily pad seems huge and then when you know You don't see the whole world until you leave college.

740
00:46:05,192 --> 00:46:06,056
Scott: Oh, yeah.

741
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,040
Scott: No one cares about that.

742
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:10,375
Scott: Yep, like the world is big only big things are big.

743
00:46:10,496 --> 00:46:11,400
Rym: like when you're in college.

744
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,640
Rym: This the eight-year super senior is like this legendary figure in the local community.

745
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:19,054
