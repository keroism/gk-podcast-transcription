20
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:10,390

Scott: Yeah, just by choosing it.

22
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:18,420

Scott: would a song to replay a song.

24
00:01:21,193 --> 00:01:23,910

25
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,985

26
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:30,400

28
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:36,446

31
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,720
Scott: He looks like an HD PC with a CD-ROM.

32
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,829
Rym: Yeah, it looks like that giant compressor up there.

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,335

34
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:52,294

36
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,464

00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:05,445
Rym: Okay good I bought a collection of Vince Guaraldi piano music.

38
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,789

39
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:07,210

40
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:09,999
Rym: The second CD I ever bought was a Michael Jackson CD.

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:23,978
Scott: The third one I ever bought was mental Metallica and justice for all there is no first CD that I bought because as soon as I had the ability to play CDs and Get money and buy my own stuff, right?

42
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,543
Rym: Didn't you do the six CDs?

43
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,432
Scott: I went to Columbia house 10 CDs.

44
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:34,379
Rym: My dad was like, yeah, it's kind of a scam.

45
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,905
Scott: it actually was not a scam.

46
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:42,650
Scott: I worked out the math super hard on it before during and constantly because I was like cancel anytime, right?

47
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,730
Scott: So I was always constantly working on the math and basically the way it worked.

48
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:50,170
Scott: Is it in order to maintain membership you had to buy a certain amount, right?

49
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,271
Scott: And they would charge you like 20 bucks for a CD which was slightly more than like 17 or 18.

50
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:56,909
Scott: You'd buy it like FYE in the mall, right?

51
00:02:58,452 --> 00:03:00,523
Scott: But every you know, first of all, you got the 10 at the beginning.

52
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:01,970
Scott: you to pay nothing for right?

53
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:10,430
Scott: So you're amortizing those right and then every once in a while when they sent you your monthly, you know envelope There'd be a little piece of paper in there.

54
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,782
Scott: They'd be like hey write a CD code on this and we'll send you a free CD.

55
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:17,762
Scott: and I got so many just like free CDs the number that I had.

56
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:23,790
Scott: I basically had to buy Like six CDs a year for 120 bucks something like that, right?

57
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,198
Rym: Which was back then actually not like.

58
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:27,282
Rym: that's what CDs cost.

59
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:31,642
Scott: and then you got the ten CDs at the beginning and you got Maybe three to four more free a year.

60
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:43,616
Rym: now what I did to make money on the side is I Would take CDs that I had access to and because we had this really expensive high-fi system with like dubbing bits and like multi Tape copy.

61
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:44,018
Rym: Yeah.

62
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,611
Rym: Yeah, I would make tapes and sell them Right.

63
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:55,920
Scott: The other thing is that the the seek the real secret of Columbia house back in the day the 90s was box sets Box sets at the mall.

64
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,610
Rym: Oh, yeah, like a zeppelin box set, right?

65
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:03,336
Scott: Well, gee, well specifically if you went to that that box set Circles on it right.

66
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:07,415
Scott: if you bought that shit at the mall like every other kid It was like 120 bucks - I was it was exactly 120 dollars.

67
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,680
Scott: I remember wanting it desperately.

68
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:16,664
Scott: Yeah, Columbia house the box sets were like just dirt as cheap.

69
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:19,291
Scott: I think I got that thing for like $30.

70
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:31,063
Rym: The worst part was that box set cost the same as record of lotus war when it came out on DVD Mm-hmm, and uh, you mean the first DVD of record of Not all of record Actually the box set.

71
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:33,716
Rym: Yeah Okay, but that was way later.

72
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:38,690
Rym: Anyway, so I have been scrawly, but actually I'm a big fan of that music independent of peanuts.

73
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:42,079
Scott: Yeah It's like people think it's the peanuts music but no.

74
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:43,725
Scott: Yeah, there's other music.

75
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,090
Scott: Yeah, that all sounds like that.

76
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:47,589
Rym: Yeah, it was a band for real normal band.

77
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:51,870
Rym: Anyway Also, it's raining and the powers rain a lot.

78
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:55,986
Rym: Yeah, the power is supposed to go out in my building today for like five minutes.

79
00:04:56,026 --> 00:05:01,129
Rym: So like this morning I was like, oh shit, so I actually like power down the NAS cuz I got a UPS.

80
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,043
Rym: I'm good I don't have a UPS cuz the power has never gone out ever in a decade.

81
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:06,168
Scott: It's still good to have UPS.

82
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:08,677
Rym: No, fuck it I'm not gonna waste money and time on that.

83
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:12,375
Rym: my old UPS the Atlanta has the battery died and I just said fuck it I threw it away.

84
00:05:12,517 --> 00:05:15,220
Scott: Yeah, I got that old UPS I did get rid of but I got a newer one.

85
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,829
Scott: that's been super great for many years.

86
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:19,129
Rym: Yeah, but I've literally never had a power outage.

87
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,034
Scott: It's it's.

88
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:24,062
Scott: I think it's activated twice in all the time I've had it.

89
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:35,131
Rym: So, uh, yeah The power is supposed to go out today for five minutes cuz I guess the building's getting smart readers Will have no impact on my life in any way, but it did not in fact happen because the kitchen is not blinking 12.

90
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:35,877
Rym: So now I'm worried.

91
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,470
Rym: today was the last day they could do it.

92
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,454
Rym: So either they're gonna do it while we're recording GeekNights Or they're not gonna do.

93
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:42,678
Scott: it only had a UPS.

94
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:45,148
Scott: We could record units for five minutes while the power is out.

95
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,479
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I don't think a UPS could actually power this.

96
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,586
Scott: this mixer actually takes a oh, yeah, okay Yeah, I thought mine just powers the computer and one monitor.

97
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:55,534
Rym: and yeah Yeah, the Marantz could run.

98
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:57,018

101
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:08,773

00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:10,197
Rym: I have not wired it up.

103
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:14,758

Rym: So If you're not aware of disenchantment, it's on Netflix.

154
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:10,607
Rym: It's basically Futurama esque like Matt Groening thing in a fantasy world.

155
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,157
Scott: It was okay It's just Futurama in a fantasy world.

156
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:16,970
Rym: as far as I know it's pretty clear that it is canonically.

157
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,391
Rym: You know that.

158
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:20,800
Rym: you know the in Futurama where fries frozen.

159
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:31,330
Rym: you see the background like aliens destroy the world and castles get built And then aliens destroy the castles and then like civilization goes back again pretty clear that it's set during that castle period right?

160
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,216
Scott: I mean, that's a thing.

161
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:33,788
Scott: I've seen happen a lot lately.

162
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:51,870
Scott: is People taking different, you know fictional universes Canonically saying they are actually the same universe But it's actually the the using time to separate them so much like for example Star Wars right and a long time ago in a galaxy far far away, right?

163
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:52,652
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

164
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:57,070
Scott: well Star Wars is canonically the same universe as like you could take fucking anything.

165
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,214
Scott: Yeah, you could just be like.

166
00:09:58,235 --> 00:10:02,050
Scott: yeah Star Wars is canonically in the same universe as Prince of Nothing.

167
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,908
Scott: Pretty well and the Prince of Nothing.

168
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:11,020
Scott: and Futurama and yelp entangled and Buggin, so fine Lucy.

169
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,770
Scott: and it was like in the cult.

170
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,955
Scott: No one can argue with you.

171
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:15,884
Rym: You didn't read them all in the culture series.

172
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:26,513
Rym: earth is Canonically like present-day earth is canonically in that universe directly and they even visit our earth at one point in the future or past In the 80s.

173
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:40,595
Scott: Wow, so so as the culture ships are floating around but earth is in the 80s Yes, and Reagan's walking around the earth is and they're just the culture is just avoiding earth and not the culture basically actually Canonically fucks with earth.

174
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:46,430
Rym: now the culture's idea is earth is relatively backward compared to the rest of the hominids.

175
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:54,775
Rym: So let's just leave it alone and use it as the reference point for how hominids progress because we were watching them Before they spaced.

176
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,164
Rym: Let's see if they actually space and how they do it.

177
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,770
Scott: Well, if they're looking in the 80s you spaced.

178
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:00,947
Rym: Yeah, we spaced a little a little bit.

179
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:02,887
Scott: Go cute space cut.

180
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,310
Scott: Check out my space.

181
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:12,683
Rym: It's funny though because the culture Asian is like wow their eyes suck and they can't see for shit And they're all slow and they're all kind of dumb.

182
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:16,598
Rym: Hmm Anyway, so disenchantment.

183
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:26,410
Rym: if I had to say rank season one of disenchantment, it's Funnier than the entire run of Futurama on average, but it is not as funny as well.

184
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:32,186
Rym: That's not very original run of Futurama before they brought it back with those increasingly dire movies.

185
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:36,762
Scott: I was gonna say like You know Futurama is just averaging out.

186
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:41,956
Scott: The whole thing is kind of not use Simpsons you gotta separate right?

187
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:43,702
Scott: It's like a really not useful yardstick.

188
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:45,066
Scott: is some parts are way better than other.

189
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:49,386
Rym: I would say disenchantment is 75% as funny as the original Futurama.

190
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:51,434
Rym: run like take that That funny.

191
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:51,896
Rym: It's okay.

192
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:52,819
Rym: It's not great.

193
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:53,260
Rym: Not bad.

194
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:53,842
Rym: I enjoyed it.

195
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:55,287
Rym: wouldn't particularly seek it out.

196
00:11:55,648 --> 00:12:14,257
Rym: However At the end of the season it kind of did something crazy in it on a cliffhanger And season two was actually really good pretty serious surprisingly heartwarming and I'm actually very invested in Third and final season.

197
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:24,290
Rym: Yeah after it like season two was Weirdly good and I did not expect to give a shit about these characters or give a shit about this universe.

198
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:26,242
Scott: And now why did you watch season two?

199
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:29,304
Scott: Yeah now that I've watched season two Why did you watch season two if you didn't give a shit?

200
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:37,620
Rym: Well because We finished another show and then it was on Netflix like oh Let's see where this was going because season one had ended on a cliffhanger.

201
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:47,450
Rym: Mmm, and honestly in terms of an animated comedy show 75% as funny as the original Futurama still above the line of like worth watching at some point.

202
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,220
Rym: But not I'm not above the line of go.

203
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,385
Rym: seek it out as soon as possible.

204
00:12:52,770 --> 00:13:03,509
Rym: Uh The problem is you got kind of gotta know what happened in season one to really follow season two and that's sort of how these things work, but Season two has a recap that pretty much tells you everything you need to know.

205
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,958
Rym: Okay, you don't need to know about anything else else.

206
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:06,560
Rym: Just watch it.

207
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:14,170
Rym: And if you've seen the show what I'll say is that How do I suddenly have an emotional attachment to King fucking Zog?

208
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,302
Rym: like for real.

209
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:21,169
Rym: so Disenchantment if you avoided it because of mediocre middling reviews of season one.

210
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:31,170
Rym: Watch this trailer for season two kind of like how I used to tell people who weren't into antenna based on the first few episodes to watch a random episode from black rose.

211
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:32,600
Rym: Watch this trailer.

212
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,050
Rym: if this trailer intrigues you at all.

213
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:35,855
Rym: This show is worth watching.

214
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,964
Rym: if you still don't care after watching this trailer.

215
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:38,607
Rym: Just don't bother.

216
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:39,049
Rym: Mmm.

217
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:51,288
Rym: So, uh, yeah, let's get right on into Things of the day you got for me.

218
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:54,840
Scott: So here's somebody you know, this is a lot of people out there.

219
00:13:55,407 --> 00:14:02,360
Scott: They can do Fancy card tricks not magic tricks where they're like pick a card and they magically make your card go through like a pane of glass.

220
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,360
Scott: Not that kind of card trick.

221
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:13,017
Scott: Yeah tricks where they're just handling the cards in a fancy way doing like, you know, smooshing them out smoothly Yeah, you know flipping them through the air right throwing cards.

222
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:18,619
Rym: in middle school I really wanted to learn how to do card close-up sleight of hand and I tried to practice.

223
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,692
Scott: now watch This isn't like necessarily sleight of hand.

224
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:29,680
Rym: It's more like, you know Cool thing I want to do like the one-handed shuffle and like the fan out fan back and all that kind of stuff.

225
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,604
Scott: That stuff's really hard.

226
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:32,150
Rym: and I gave up that forget the word.

227
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:32,894
Scott: There's a word for it.

228
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,285
Rym: Yeah, whatever really hard to do I gave up immediately.

229
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:42,410
Scott: So this person they made this video using You know stop-motion animation.

230
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:50,839
Scott: Yep, and basically to video Increasingly unrealistic and impossible tricks of that nature.

231
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:54,067
Scott: But it looks like they're really happening.

232
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:55,272
Scott: cuz stop-motion animation.

233
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:57,280
Scott: It's it's really slick, right?

234
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:11,160
Scott: So it's like when you start watching it you can sort of get this feeling like whoa Is there is someone really doing this trick and they're just sort of you know videoed it and then slowly You know just cut a lot of frames of video out to make it look like, you know, stop-motion animation.

235
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:12,978
Scott: It's like no, no one can do this.

236
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:19,374
Scott: It's like it's all stop-motion animation tricks, but it's really impressive.

237
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:21,940
Scott: and mostly I think what makes this video great?

238
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:27,420
Scott: the creativity and Things they thought to do right?

239
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,200
Scott: It's a how many ideas can you have for how to do stop-motion with a deck of cards?

240
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:36,620
Scott: That would look cool and be fun and visually interesting.

241
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:43,259
Scott: And it's like every time you think you're they ran out of ideas They got more ideas, even though it's only less than three minutes of ideas.

242
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,298
Scott: so fun to watch one time.

243
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:57,600
Rym: So I was poking around on YouTube and I saw something that is that is the kind of thing that me and Scott would be Like who and want to watch a YouTube channel that has animated Hungarian folk tales.

244
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,060
Scott: I mean we had good success with the Japanese folk tales, even though they were pretty repetitive a lot of times.

245
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:08,280
Rym: Yes, so Hungarian folk tales and the one I'm gonna link to is the one that we've that Emily and I watch the Fox Princess.

246
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,027
Scott: No, that's definitely one I would choose.

247
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:20,789
Rym: Yeah, and based on title alone it The way I will describe this is that it swerves and you might be thinking of course Why would you make it to think of?

248
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:21,799
Rym: David didn't do something weird?

249
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,973
Rym: every time you think okay, that was the swerve just keep watching it because This is a trip over the course of ten minutes.

250
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:31,700
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I haven't watched it.

251
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,144
Scott: I've only looked over Rym shoulder.

252
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:35,511
Scott: This is worth watching on the one hand.

253
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:38,340
Scott: It gives me good yellow submarine vibes.

254
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,874
Rym: It definitely feels like yellow submarine animation.

255
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:45,019
Scott: on the other hand It gives me bad Zelda Phillips CDI vibes.

256
00:16:45,382 --> 00:16:46,149
Rym: It's also got that.

257
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:52,420
Rym: and the worst part about it But also the best part is that it has a narrator in English like it's just in English that a dub.

258
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,908
Scott: I guess the original one was Hungarian.

259
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:54,753
Scott: I'm not sure.

260
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:58,207
Scott: or was it originally Hungarian folk tales for an english-speaking audience.

261
00:16:58,428 --> 00:17:06,676
Rym: I'm not sure I could have looked into like where this came from and I started to research Description say I decided I didn't care that made by the what it was, right?

262
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:08,660
Rym: Yeah, I know I'm saying I didn't care that much.

263
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,959
Rym: It was made looks like by some Hungarian people and I guess they got someone to do this voiceover.

264
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:20,138
Rym: Pretty sure they got the lowest possible bidder because the voiceover is like someone reading a storybook to you, which is fine.

265
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:27,362
Rym: the pacing of the narration at no point changes Sentences.

266
00:17:27,502 --> 00:17:34,220
Rym: just roll into other sentences in this straight line of inflection regardless of who's talking or what's happening.

267
00:17:34,342 --> 00:17:41,185
Rym: Like it is weird But it's also definitely worth watching Because it's also weird.

268
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:42,550
Rym: and that's all I'm gonna say.

269
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,516
Rym: you gotta see where this goes.

270
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:51,860
Rym: I defy you To predict where this will end based on anything that happens in the course of it.

271
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:58,564
Scott: Please send us folk tales from all countries that are not the United States Japan or Hungary.

272
00:17:58,585 --> 00:18:00,210
Rym: I do like that.

273
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,640
Rym: the good characters all have this really rye smile.

274
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:05,190
Rym: They all look like they're fucking up to something.

275
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:05,734
Rym: cuz they are.

276
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:09,953
Rym: Oh, yeah Like the princess is up to something the Fox is something.

277
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,580
Rym: the good guy is up to something.

278
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:13,889
Rym: The bad guys are smiling in a different way.

279
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,073
Rym: Everybody's up to something.

280
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,740
Scott: the point is send me all your folk tales.

281
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,978
Rym: Yeah, but this one just watch this.

282
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:22,860
Scott: Which country has best folk tales?

283
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:25,046
Rym: Well best and best.

284
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:27,455
Scott: Argentinian folk tale Nigerian folk tale.

285
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:27,877
Scott: Bring it on.

286
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:34,820
Rym: Yeah In the meta moment you guys book club book is still the tale of Genji, I feel like the tale of Genji.

287
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:37,080
Scott: I don't know if we should actually do this crazy idea.

288
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,420
Rym: I just had really two seconds ago want to break it up and like chapter by chapter do a little mini show.

289
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:46,762
Scott: No, that would be too many shows Is so big Giving up.

290
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:47,303
Rym: Did you bail?

291
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:49,189
Scott: No, okay, not bailing it.

292
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:49,510
Scott: Never.

293
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,252
Scott: Why would I do that?

294
00:18:50,272 --> 00:18:51,014
Scott: That would be the worst.

295
00:18:51,797 --> 00:19:00,991
Scott: I feel like we should do another book club not delay tale of Genji Right, but I feel like I could.

296
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:02,680
Scott: it's gonna take me so long to read this.

297
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,088
Scott: I could read other books at the same time.

298
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:06,573
Rym: I could see that like we could in.

299
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:11,860
Scott: so we could do another book club within Right, we'd be like, alright, we're doing tale of Genji.

300
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,560
Scott: The book club episode is going to be so long from now, but we'll have a rest just to have book club episodes.

301
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:21,200
Scott: We're gonna read this other shorter book in the meantime.

302
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:27,420
Scott: All right Cuz I actually do that and so that will have a book club episode like a few a month or two from now.

303
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:32,020
Rym: I did make that promise that my next book club choice cuz it's my choice next was gonna be pretty short.

304
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:35,796
Scott: So maybe I'm talking like a tiny book like one of the ones is like this.

305
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:36,619
Rym: Yeah.

306
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,688
Rym: Yeah Yeah, like this is that this would be like like flat land short.

307
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:40,952
Rym: Yeah, I'm not.

308
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:41,714
Rym: no Dumas.

309
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:42,556
Scott: Don't pick flatland.

310
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:45,152
Rym: I Don't need to read flatland again.

311
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:45,840
Rym: I read flatland.

312
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,588
Scott: That's a short book that comes to mind.

313
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:49,512
Scott: Yes, really tiny.

314
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:51,360
Rym: I got plenty of books that are about that.

315
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:51,741
Rym: I

316
00:19:51,761 --> 00:20:07,480
Scott: feel like we should do a tiny ass book that we can you know and Tale of Genji is still the book club book But just have other tiny books that we can do real quick Just to have episodes while we read this massive Tale of Genji that is literally changing while we're reading.

317
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:10,065
Rym: Also coming up soon.

318
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:17,332
Rym: as I said many times recently and I'm gonna post up our schedule soon We will be at PAX unplugged in December doing not one but two events.

319
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:18,456
Rym: They're gonna be awesome.

320
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:19,460
Scott: Go to both of them.

321
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,320
Scott: I think if you have the PAX app that you can know this that schedules up.

322
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:35,574
Scott: I think there's like some amount of schedule for PAX Unplugged that is already up and I know the date time and room of our Panel, I just like yeah I think there is public availability of some portion of the PAX Unplugged schedule.

323
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:36,517
Scott: seek it out.

324
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:37,600
Scott: if you are going to pack some.

325
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:40,597
Rym: Yeah, but our panel is take your fucking turn.

326
00:20:40,637 --> 00:20:43,863
Rym: That's right Because I'm real excited about this one.

327
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:47,669
Rym: Also, if you didn't notice Emily and I are doing a sideshow.

328
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:50,798
Scott: we are Discussing sideshow, is it a?

329
00:20:50,938 --> 00:20:52,904
Scott: is it a bearded lady a fire eater?

330
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:53,406
Rym: It's more.

331
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:54,790
Rym: it's more melonless Bob.

332
00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:03,232
Rym: Okay, so we are watching every single Disney theatrical feature animation in chronological order of release and doing a full podcast on each one.

333
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:09,249
Rym: we just recorded peachy Oh and Having watched Benichi means adaptation.

334
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:19,766
Rym: There's actually a really good Obsessive pop-culture disorder that crack show that was on a while ago about how fucked up Pinocchio Pinocchio is.

335
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:27,864
Rym: Okay, and anyway Having I had not seen Pinocchio since I was a really little kid watching it again.

336
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:29,710
Rym: There's some things I did not notice.

337
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,181
Rym: They were actually pretty funny and I remember only portions.

338
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:34,565
Scott: mostly most of the stuff remembers.

339
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,110
Scott: from the beginning and from the ocean.

340
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:37,035
Rym: I was impressed.

341
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:38,401
Scott: I don't remember too much.

342
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:39,507
Rym: That is the part.

343
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:43,290
Rym: I didn't remember About the horny fish that tries to see Jiminy Cricket's dick.

344
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:48,688
Scott: Yeah, pretty much unless it's from the beginning like in the workshop or in the ocean I don't remember it.

345
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:51,980
Rym: But as a kid Jiminy Cricket was just think I remember visit.

346
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:54,870
Rym: remember Jiminy Cricket is hilarious cuz he's just a hobo.

347
00:21:55,392 --> 00:22:00,709
Scott: Yeah, I vaguely remember like some seedy part of town near the ocean, but that's it.

348
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:02,795
Rym: You're thinking of Pleasure Island.

349
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:04,300
Scott: Okay, I guess that was false memory.

350
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:12,648
Rym: But yeah, I remember the ocean and now the beginning Nothing else I was pleasantly surprised by is that old Disney movies have a lot of racism in them.

351
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:25,166
Rym: Oh, yeah There's really only two racist things in Pinocchio only two Ones in the background and one's pretty front and center, but only one only a couple of scenes.

352
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:38,530
Rym: Stromboli is pretty racist But the weird thing is you'd think is it also racist against Italians, but while it's ostensibly said in Italy Everything feels German like Austrian.

353
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:45,130
Rym: Yep, like the way everything's drawn the way all the characters talk everything feels Austrian, which is just weird.

354
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:47,069
Rym: But anyway, I will link to that.

355
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:47,958
Rym: We're gonna put it.

356
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:53,444
Rym: the episode will appear Imminently and there's a whole playlist on even though it's posted to the Ignites page around.

357
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:56,556
Rym: you do not do need not give us Even a single dollar.

358
00:22:56,838 --> 00:22:57,662
Rym: they are all public.

359
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:58,827
Rym: You can just listen to them.

360
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:01,925
Rym: Mm-hmm They're just posted on the page around because that's an easy place to put them.

361
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:02,287
Rym: Mm-hmm.

362
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:04,856
Rym: Otherwise we should get right into this.

363
00:23:05,037 --> 00:23:08,050
Rym: So Scott hasn't seen Carolyn Tuesday yet, so we can't do a show on it.

364
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:16,681
Scott: Well, I have time to watch it right now and I was like, hey, it's Halloween month D nights anniversary What we used to do like full month-long spooky shit.

365
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:19,068
Scott: Well, I was like what Halloween thing can we talk about this?

366
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:19,590
Scott: animated?

367
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,445
Rym: Let's not take the x-train, right?

368
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:26,500
Scott: Let's do Nightmare, you know never before Christmas we could do that sometime.

369
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:28,547
Rym: Yeah, I didn't watch it again.

370
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:31,475
Scott: then I was like, wait a minute That's you know, that's like 90 minutes long.

371
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,662
Rym: I guess right and we're busy right?

372
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:38,859
Scott: Why don't we do a Great pumpkin like I try to think of Halloween specials.

373
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:41,068
Scott: That's like the first one except your fields this heck on.

374
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:43,638
Rym: I remember Yeah, the the Halloween specials.

375
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:45,325
Rym: I remember the things that as a kid.

376
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:54,689
Rym: I remember watching on Halloween Specifically are it's the great pumpkin Charlie Brown that terrifying Garfield thing where the ghost pirates literally tried to murder Garfield.

377
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:55,773
Scott: for real Love that one.

378
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:56,677
Rym: I do love that.

379
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:58,545
Scott: Well, my favorite part is where he goes up to the house.

380
00:23:58,566 --> 00:23:59,108
Scott: He's like, gimme.

381
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:05,496
Scott: Yep No trick-or-treat just like gimme and The actual movie Halloween.

382
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:10,130
Rym: Mm-hmm, which is just a slasher film, but I would often see that just on Halloween.

383
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,838
Scott: So I haven't seen this thing.

384
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:13,867
Scott: So to give it some background, right?

385
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:16,152
Scott: So first of all 1966.

386
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:18,560
Rym: it's a 25-minute TV special, right?

387
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,030
Rym: So the second Charlie Brown animated special ever, right?

388
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,060
Scott: So first of all, I thought was the third one ever double-checking here.

389
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:27,950
Rym: Oh, it was the second holiday themed one, right?

390
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:28,640
Scott: It's the third.

391
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:39,049
Scott: So this is a thing that my parents saw when it was brand new when they were like You know 10 11 12 something like that somewhere around there.

392
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:43,090
Scott: And so for them it was like a huge deal.

393
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:50,370
Scott: So them having children watch it every year was like us trying to make our children watch whatever.

394
00:24:50,731 --> 00:24:58,391
Rym: Yep, anime that yep, so we will be like, all right kid It's time to watch take the x-ray and they know dad now Right.

395
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:07,630
Scott: and this thing was literally on broadcast television every year every year And we everyone would sit like we would all watch it the night games like an event.

396
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:08,917
Rym: We don't be talking about it.

397
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:09,239
Rym: Right?

398
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,179
Scott: You didn't see this again Until next year there was not.

399
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:15,850
Rym: really we would see it with your VCR.

400
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:20,110
Rym: Yes, because one thing I've talked to this for one thing my family did my whole thing is the VCR too much.

401
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:25,370
Rym: Yes, well the rule was we had ed blocking in the 80s because no one wants to watch commercials.

402
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:29,269
Rym: So the rule was anything that was on TV that anyone wanted to watch.

403
00:25:30,076 --> 00:25:31,870
Rym: One of the chores someone in the family afternoon.

404
00:25:32,011 --> 00:25:44,459
Rym: We rotated it just like picking up the dog poop or taking the garbage out or mowing the lawn Was record the thing everyone wants to watch on VHS tapes, but pause it when the commercials come on So the rest of the family does not have to see the commercials.

405
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,350
Rym: We did that for fucking everything.

406
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:53,390
Rym: We have every single episode of like every major TV show for my entire life up until high school on VHS tapes.

407
00:25:53,672 --> 00:26:01,410
Scott: Anyway, pretty sure we threw them all away, but point is This is like an event right because there weren't ways to see things back then easily.

408
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:09,217
Scott: Yeah I wasn't sold on VHS until I think way late in the 90s and we lent our tape to other families Sometimes except you unless you're a rims family, right?

409
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:10,381
Scott: It's like it was.

410
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:13,651
Scott: it was like oh, it's on everyone went to watch it Right.

411
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:18,856
Scott: Yeah, so also, you know peanuts at the time Was still really big.

412
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:23,814
Scott: Well, I mean, it's still kind of big but it's like it was this thing Where it's like.

413
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:29,414
Scott: I didn't know too many people who were like huge peanuts true but everybody knew who.

414
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:36,334
Rym: Charlie everybody knew it and they knew like the deal with Peppermint Patty and Lucy and Linus and everyone.

415
00:26:36,354 --> 00:26:37,278
Scott: it's like you didn't.

416
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:38,502
Scott: there weren't like haters.

417
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:47,338
Scott: there might be haters of it somewhere but like their warrant It's felt like it was a thing that everyone knew and liked, you know It's like you'd be watching the the Thanksgiving Parade.

418
00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:48,561
Scott: you'd be like a snoopy balloon.

419
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:51,209
Scott: Yeah, or you'd have like, you know.

420
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:56,065
Rym: So we had the original books like when they're basically the trade paper bags of every peanuts.

421
00:26:56,145 --> 00:27:01,157
Scott: I got those from my school Elementary school library had those.

422
00:27:01,177 --> 00:27:03,345
Rym: Oh, my parents just had like the original printings.

423
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:04,810
Scott: Yeah, these were those at the school.

424
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:07,540
Rym: They were so yellow and so crackly.

425
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,510
Rym: Yep, and they smelled like mildew is from elementary school library.

426
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:18,683
Rym: I think I read every single peanuts comic that was published up until like the late 80s.

427
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:22,300
Scott: Anyway, so but it was like this thing.

428
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,149
Scott: It was just like, you know everywhere everyone kind of liked it.

429
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,876
Scott: But no, you know, it wasn't in nor.

430
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:28,723
Rym: so I have a suspicion.

431
00:27:28,743 --> 00:27:31,012
Rym: I can't prove this I don't know.

432
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:35,490
Rym: I don't think younger people today actually know much about peanuts.

433
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,783
Rym: I think they just know that peanuts is the Charlie Brown thing.

434
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:46,270
Rym: recognize Snoop, you know Snoopy And Charlie Brown, but I think they will literally not recognize any other character.

435
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,040
Scott: Well, I mean they might recognize that as a Snoopy character.

436
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,610
Rym: Yeah, but those kids don't fucking know who Pigpen is.

437
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,189
Scott: No, they probably don't know anything right or early lesbian representation in comics, right?

438
00:27:57,472 --> 00:28:02,964
Scott: I think also is that I sorta in my life I sort of went through a phase of on the.

439
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:05,195
Scott: at the beginning It was sort of that feeling right.

440
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:06,278
Scott: everyone like Snoopy.

441
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:07,001
Scott: It's Snoopy.

442
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,647
Scott: Yay, but not mega.

443
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,330
Scott: Yay, right?

444
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:14,346
Scott: And then later when I was like older it was sort of like man.

445
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:15,209
Scott: What's you know?

446
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,157
Scott: What's the deal with Snoopy's the board?

447
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:17,821
Scott: It's a boring.

448
00:28:17,842 --> 00:28:20,197
Scott: the boring newspaper comic It's no.

449
00:28:20,217 --> 00:28:21,930
Scott: Calvin and Hobbes is no far side.

450
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,989
Rym: The reason I got man, it was specifically that I would see peanuts in the newspaper and it was garbage pablum.

451
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:33,570
Rym: But I had the original books and I really liked the old peanuts comics a lot anyway.

452
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,470
Rym: So I remember I had this impression as a young kid that it was something that used to be great and is terrible now.

453
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:43,950
Scott: I mean I just had the impression that the quality of it it hadn't changed.

454
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:50,357
Scott: That simply I had changed and realized that it was just sort of you know This mad boring.

455
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:54,775
Rym: the only reason I knew the difference was that because I had all those old books I didn't keep them.

456
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,681
Scott: I checked my library.

457
00:28:55,882 --> 00:28:59,886
Rym: Oh, we own them because the family Oh anyway, Charlie Brown looked so different.

458
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:06,768
Rym: in the old car Felt this very clear distinction between old peanuts and new peanuts, but now being even older right?

459
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:24,967
Scott: I have a completely different view of it Which is like wow that when I was less intelligent, but thought I was smarter than I was I thought that this you know peanuts thing was just sort of like this mad Boring milquetoast deal and I had just liked it when I was a kid because I didn't know because I was you know a kid.

460
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:30,490
Scott: But now it's like oh now I can see what this actually is saying.

461
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:35,650
Scott: Yeah, now that I'm way old and I can see the genius of it and how great it is.

462
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,185
Rym: But it's tricky because on one end there's some genius to it, but there is also some milquetoast.

463
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:41,189
Rym: Yeah, we'll get to that.

464
00:29:41,269 --> 00:30:00,789
Rym: but this Also has an aspect of and I'm gonna compare it to the sanctuary anime OAV In the sense that there you know those 90s anime OAVs where there was a really popular Manga a comic yeah, and then they wouldn't just take the entire comic and make a cartoon

465
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:01,090
Scott: no

466
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:07,650
Rym: But they would take like a set of scenes from the comic and make like a special that you could watch.

467
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:17,899
Rym: That would just let you see some fun stuff assuming that you've already read the comic and know these people are and This has a lot of that in it in the sense Oh, yeah, you don't know anything about peanuts.

468
00:30:18,322 --> 00:30:21,581
Scott: this like you got it This animation makes all not a lot of sense.

469
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:30,710
Rym: like you literally have to know Linus's full deal and peppermint patties full like it's no peppermint patties and even there is no character development or introduction whatsoever.

470
00:30:31,493 --> 00:30:41,289
Rym: Oh, there's one tiny piece of character development because a character Suckered into this made-up religion and then realizes it's a scam and goes home early, right?

471
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,318
Rym: Okay, so your development, right?

472
00:30:43,338 --> 00:30:45,230
Scott: So there was so the setup right?

473
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,228
Scott: This is Christmas one.

474
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:49,241
Scott: Then there was some baseball one and these things were airing every year.

475
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:56,946
Scott: the baseball one they stopped but the Christmas one in the Halloween They continue to air on television every year non-stop until this day and into the future.

476
00:30:57,327 --> 00:30:58,190
Scott: It's so American.

477
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:04,342
Scott: I don't even know people outside America ever seen these things or heard of them Maybe the English-speaking world, but I don't like.

478
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:07,093
Scott: I can't imagine that like yeah There's any of these.

479
00:31:07,113 --> 00:31:09,240
Scott: even hat places don't even have Halloween.

480
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:11,387
Scott: Maybe the Christmas one airs in other places.

481
00:31:11,407 --> 00:31:12,170
Scott: I don't even fucking know.

482
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:19,912
Scott: But and then my parents we watch it every year because it was their thing from when they were kids Right,

483
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:20,654
Rym: and now

484
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:25,910
Scott: I haven't seen it in forever and I go back to take a look at the Halloween one because it's Halloween month

485
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:31,089
Rym: And the first thing I noticed was as a kid I felt like this was like an hour and a lot.

486
00:31:31,471 --> 00:31:35,530
Scott: Now the first thing is I go download it and I look and it's 20-something minutes.

487
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,916
Scott: I'm like, why is this show short?

488
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:38,161
Rym: and I looked up.

489
00:31:38,221 --> 00:31:40,270
Rym: I double-checked to make sure I didn't get a bad file.

490
00:31:40,713 --> 00:31:42,570
Scott: No, yeah, I thought I might have got a bad file.

491
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:55,890
Scott: Nope, what at the come there were so many commercials on it when we were kids Because it did get like an hour time slot Time slot with big ads because it was a TV event back in the day.

492
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,164
Scott: It was a big deal and they stretched it the fuck out.

493
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:03,458
Scott: Yeah over a whole hour We watched 30 minutes ads and 30 minutes of Charlie Brown.

494
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,184
Scott: I just watched a Charlie Brown.

495
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,086
Scott: It's short as hell.

496
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:06,648
Rym: Yep.

497
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:20,130
Rym: So What's interesting is I don't know if kids today should really watch it because without the context of the characters I don't think they would even see the fairly complex like interesting meta-narrative, right?

498
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:30,068
Rym: but what they should definitely watch without even watching the whole thing is the Snoopy side story because that is really good like atmospheric storytelling and we're gonna get today.

499
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:31,173
Rym: Holy shit That's the part.

500
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:31,756
Rym: I remember the most.

501
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:34,528
Rym: as a kid that part was scary to me.

502
00:32:34,608 --> 00:32:36,970
Rym: Oh, yeah I was really terrified for Snoopy.

503
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:44,033
Rym: Oh, yeah Partly because I was kind of also into World War one and like that like really resonated up with was yes I did.

504
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:45,601
Rym: I knew the Red Baron was.

505
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:47,390
Rym: I actually knew a lot about World War one.

506
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:49,624
Scott: Charlie Brown says the word stop with like.

507
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:57,429
Rym: yeah, I've times Like the bit where Snoopy is like getting starting up is stop.

508
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:00,477
Rym: That's kind of how it was to start those fucking.

509
00:33:00,738 --> 00:33:01,039
Scott: Yeah.

510
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:03,447
Scott: All right, so is a deal, right?

511
00:33:03,507 --> 00:33:10,087
Scott: So they This thing is animated Surprisingly well for 60s television.

512
00:33:10,127 --> 00:33:13,487
Scott: It's better Even better than 70s 70s and 80s cartoons.

513
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:14,070
Scott: that was cheap.

514
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:16,758
Rym: Yeah It's still very badly but not.

515
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:20,650
Scott: but like you gotta think Looney Tunes are way older this and way better animated.

516
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,924
Rym: Yeah by miles and miles a lot of Looney Tunes were intended to be shown in the theater.

517
00:33:24,944 --> 00:33:25,345
Rym: Exactly.

518
00:33:25,385 --> 00:33:26,870
Rym: That's not a TV special, right?

519
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,823
Scott: So for television animation, this is way above par.

520
00:33:31,225 --> 00:33:34,135
Scott: but for animation as a whole it's way below par.

521
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:46,751
Rym: but kind of like we talked about averaging out Futurama the Snoopy part is Really well animated and with a very minimalist palette tells a pretty terrifying and complex story Right.

522
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:53,095
Scott: So what you have here in this 20 minutes is really let's see one Two.

523
00:33:53,276 --> 00:34:07,530
Scott: you have like three or four different storylines That don't individually get a lot of screen time and they're all sort of tied together by the main Great pumpkin storyline, which is the beginning and the end and all sort of throughout.

524
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:11,304
Rym: So let's talk about them all in order cuz Snoopy's is the easiest Snoopy.

525
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:12,949
Scott: So Snoopy is a dog.

526
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:18,844
Scott: Yeah, right heat for Halloween He's gonna dress up as a World War one fighting ace.

527
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:21,574
Rym: and that if you haven't read the comics There's this is a whole.

528
00:34:21,835 --> 00:34:22,799
Scott: it's a whole thing.

529
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:24,847
Scott: It's a whole thing that Snoopy always does.

530
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:28,136
Scott: All right, so Basically Snoopy just appears.

531
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:31,790
Scott: he doesn't really appear in it until he's dressed up as the flying ace as his costume.

532
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,577
Scott: Everyone else is a ghost or a witch or something.

533
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:37,010
Rym: Yep, right and then well, they're either ghosts or ghost witches.

534
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:38,676
Rym: Those are the two costumes.

535
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,290
Scott: and then Snoopy goes like often as complete tangent.

536
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:46,301
Scott: You know, that's not like Charlie Brown narrates.

537
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:47,505
Scott: cuz they're like, where is Snoopy?

538
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:48,730
Scott: and Charlie Brown narrates?

539
00:34:49,010 --> 00:35:03,103
Rym: Well, he only narrates a little bit adventure that Snoopy is on as the fighting ace But he only narrates a tiny bit of it and the rest of it is just told by Snoopy pantomiming Being shot down behind enemy lines in World War one in France.

540
00:35:03,123 --> 00:35:08,825
Scott: right and the animation of this whole Scene that has nothing to do with Halloween except for the fact that Snoopy's in a costume.

541
00:35:08,926 --> 00:35:17,130
Scott: Yep, right Is a. it's animated in sort of a. it gives me almost like a tiny bit of like a Ralph Bakshi kind of.

542
00:35:18,055 --> 00:35:25,017
Rym: I feel that it's kind of surreal And dark But in and scary.

543
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:36,470
Rym: and yet it tells a very specific story like the way Snoopy's Reacting and it's clear like when he's shooting at someone When he's in trouble when someone's shooting it when you get shot down like all these you also got to keep in mind that when?

544
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,479
Scott: This is made in the 60s, right?

545
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:47,570
Scott: Yeah, this animation itself is Now as old as about as old as World War one was when the animation was new.

546
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:49,415
Scott: Yep, so you could think of this.

547
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:54,508
Scott: animation is almost a pretty close midpoint between today and World War one.

548
00:35:54,829 --> 00:36:04,600
Scott: Yep and like I think a World War one when this is a new animation was as Good in the memory of people as this animation is.

549
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,270
Scott: but look at Snoopy story as distant history.

550
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:09,688
Rym: So Snoopy basically has there's two parts of his story.

551
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:18,000
Rym: okay, he has this whole fantasy where he gets shot down behind enemy lines and has to make his way back through this war-torn world and Then he makes it home.

552
00:36:18,281 --> 00:36:19,245
Rym: He makes it back to the party.

553
00:36:19,285 --> 00:36:20,430
Scott: Well, he's not home.

554
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:24,827
Scott: He's at this Halloween party suddenly well but in the apple bombing water.

555
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:27,477
Rym: This is where it's kind of subtle and interesting.

556
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:31,733
Rym: because then the second part of his story is there's a joke where he kisses Lucy Whatever.

557
00:36:31,894 --> 00:36:49,991
Rym: Mm-hmm, but then there's this really melancholy bit where he sits down with the brush rotor in the piano and Just like is basically having these PTSD flashbacks as the music shifts between light-hearted music and sad music both evoking World War one era music mm-hmm and That.

558
00:36:50,171 --> 00:36:54,324
Rym: that arc is really compelling and it's surprising that that is just this little.

559
00:36:54,364 --> 00:37:02,130
Scott: and somehow they fit that whole Thing in in the 20 minutes where all this other stuff is even though the pacing feels real slow.

560
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:08,350
Scott: People are walking slow talking slow doing stuff slow, right and they managed to cram all that in there.

561
00:37:08,571 --> 00:37:13,870
Rym: And yet Snoopy does not say a word and Charlie Brown does not even narrate anything other than the very very very beginning.

562
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:20,470
Scott: It feels like this extended, you know side sequence right and the piano thing goes on for what feels like a while.

563
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:24,022
Rym: Yeah, and it's right just really melancholy and scary.

564
00:37:24,082 --> 00:37:24,845
Scott: and what the hell is that?

565
00:37:24,885 --> 00:37:26,330
Scott: Why is this in a Halloween special?

566
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,170
Scott: Yeah, it's like they you know, they just use the Halloween.

567
00:37:29,351 --> 00:37:39,360
Scott: The only connection to Halloween is the fact that Snoopy's in a costume Yeah, even though he does that on non Halloween occasions frequently in other Peanuts things Yeah, but that alone makes this work.

568
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,070
Scott: That is the highlight of the entire thing.

569
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,515
Scott: That's like the reason to watch this.

570
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,607
Rym: I would consider that an extremely important piece of animation.

571
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:48,292
Scott: Yes, indeed All right.

572
00:37:48,312 --> 00:37:57,608
Scott: So the actual the main story, okay, right is That Linus for some reason believes in this great pumpkin, which is basically Santa Claus in pumpkin form.

573
00:37:57,668 --> 00:38:08,150
Scott: Yep And he believes that if you stay on the pumpkin patch all Halloween night and are the most sincere The great pumpkin will come to your pumpkin patch and not some other pumpkin pad.

574
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:10,579
Rym: What I like is that it is very clear.

575
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,748
Scott: he writes a letter to the great pumpkin just like Santa.

576
00:38:12,828 --> 00:38:13,230
Rym: it's very clear.

577
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,535
Rym: He's done this his entire life.

578
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:16,361
Rym: It has never come to pass.

579
00:38:16,803 --> 00:38:22,058
Rym: His faith is unshaken and Literally everyone else on earth thinks he is a moron.

580
00:38:22,098 --> 00:38:26,650
Rym: Yep, except Sally who doesn't know that this is a thing yet, right?

581
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:32,205
Scott: Well Sally Charlie Brown's little sister right in love with him doesn't believe in the great pumpkin.

582
00:38:32,285 --> 00:38:33,590
Scott: She's skeptical, right?

583
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,804
Scott: She's in love with Linus and trust him.

584
00:38:35,844 --> 00:38:36,590
Scott: So she's like, you know what?

585
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,284
Scott: I'm gonna go for this great pumpkin thing one time.

586
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:39,847
Scott: I'll see.

587
00:38:39,907 --> 00:38:40,269
Scott: I'll see.

588
00:38:40,672 --> 00:38:46,237
Scott: Yeah, you know just to be with Linus in the pumpkin patch all night And you get this whole like literally everyone's like Linus.

589
00:38:46,578 --> 00:38:47,340
Rym: What the fuck?

590
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:48,302
Rym: Stop it.

591
00:38:48,322 --> 00:38:49,004
Rym: Sally.

592
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,307
Rym: Don't he's crazy.

593
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:51,230
Scott: Don't go with him.

594
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,213
Scott: Yeah, trust us.

595
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:55,104
Rym: Yeah, and in the very end the moral is religion is fake.

596
00:38:55,425 --> 00:38:56,208
Rym: Don't waste your time.

597
00:38:56,448 --> 00:38:59,358
Rym: Yep Dude, you missed out on real life.

598
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,846
Scott: Yeah, she missed out on trick-or-treating.

599
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,050
Scott: She missed out on the party.

600
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,662
Scott: She gets away mad right and you know tells him off.

601
00:39:06,823 --> 00:39:11,550
Scott: and it also even the fact that she you know Would you know wanted to hang with him or and get close to him?

602
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,869
Scott: No, that wasn't you know?

603
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,760
Scott: That didn't make up for the fact that her Halloween is completely ruined.

604
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,997
Rym: and meanwhile Linus immediately just says well It'll definitely happen next year.

605
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:21,082
Rym: Like that's the end.

606
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:25,973
Rym: like Linus did not learn his lesson Probably got sick.

607
00:39:26,154 --> 00:39:38,829
Rym: Yep, right and then there's this little not aside part where Lucy is sick of his shit But clearly has set her alarm for 4 a.m Knowing that this will happen every year and takes care of him.

608
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:43,128
Rym: Anyway, despite the fact that this is a hundred percent his fault.

609
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:51,256
Rym: Mm-hmm And that's that's heartwarming but also kind of sad and it's that's a pretty complex Story.

610
00:39:51,518 --> 00:39:54,272
Scott: Well, the real ending is the next day Right.

611
00:39:54,373 --> 00:39:55,977
Scott: the true ending right is?

612
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:00,210
Scott: you know Linus and Charlie Brown are both talking about how shitty their Halloween's were right?

613
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:00,792
Rym: Charlie?

614
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:01,936
Rym: well, we'll get to Charlie Brown.

615
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:05,488
Rym: last Charlie Brown's Halloween was shitty because everyone's shitty to him for no reason.

616
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,505
Rym: That's right But it's like all there is everyone shitty to Charlie Brown.

617
00:40:08,525 --> 00:40:09,350
Rym: the end, right?

618
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,050
Scott: So Charlie Brown is doing you know, the normal Halloween, right?

619
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:17,642
Scott: He you know has to kick a football falls for the trick again.

620
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:18,605
Scott: Yeah, right.

621
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,090
Rym: His friends are all just pieces of shit.

622
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:25,180
Scott: Yeah, well, especially, you know, yeah Everyone no one helps them.

623
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:26,530
Rym: Everyone's making fun of him.

624
00:40:26,712 --> 00:40:27,439
Scott: They're either.

625
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:33,230
Scott: they're either Directly, but Lucy's the only one who's like directly bullying him and I guess violet and maybe right.

626
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:38,447
Scott: Yeah, everyone else is just sort of chilling and going along but they don't come to his aid.

627
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:44,470
Scott: Yeah, right They don't like defend Charlie Brown They just sort of stand there and look and laugh and don't do anything.

628
00:40:44,911 --> 00:40:48,099
Rym: All the other parents in the neighborhood are in on this bullying.

629
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,002
Scott: Well notably.

630
00:40:49,122 --> 00:40:49,663
Scott: Well, that's true.

631
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:52,050
Scott: But notably I got there is there is no.

632
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:57,846
Rym: Yeah, I say that a lot whenever we're playing a game or anything it's like what'd you get?

633
00:40:57,866 --> 00:40:59,230
Rym: I got 15 victory points.

634
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,156
Rym: I got nine victory points.

635
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:01,022
Rym: I got a rock.

636
00:41:01,404 --> 00:41:02,330
Rym: This is what I'm quoting.

637
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,955
Rym: Yeah, this is what I've been quoting my whole life.

638
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:07,467
Rym: The moral is everybody hates Charlie Brown for no good reason.

639
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:08,470
Rym: the end, right?

640
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:15,370
Scott: So Charlie Brown they go trick-or-treating Right, and of course at every house some people get cookies some people get candy.

641
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,823
Scott: They have three houses in a row to give them a rock.

642
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:19,250
Scott: There was actually I read online.

643
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:20,677
Scott: They discussed this.

644
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,130
Scott: at first they only wanted him to get a rock at one house.

645
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:23,469
Scott: Yeah.

646
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:28,010
Scott: And then they were like no there was like Aria and apparently he ended up getting the rock at all three houses.

647
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:35,250
Scott: And then people sent candy to the production company like candy for Charlie Brown because they felt so bad.

648
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:37,175
Scott: Real life.

649
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:38,441
Scott: people sent real candy.

650
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:40,250
Scott: Yep, right for Charlie Brown anyway.

651
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:42,035
Scott: And then he was.

652
00:41:42,055 --> 00:41:45,390
Scott: he was so happy that he got invited to the Halloween party.

653
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:48,358
Scott: He's only invited to the Halloween party, right?

654
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:48,960
Scott: It's implied.

655
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,182
Scott: He wouldn't have been invited except for the fact that they could use his head as The perfect drawing surface because he's got a big brown bald head.

656
00:41:57,202 --> 00:42:03,479
Scott: Yeah come up with jack-o'-lantern ideas Right and he wasn't having a big bald round head.

657
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:04,784
Scott: He probably wouldn't have gotten invited.

658
00:42:04,804 --> 00:42:12,230
Rym: Yeah, which is well It's hard to say because what we don't actually know our violence motivations is probably violent.

659
00:42:12,311 --> 00:42:15,070
Rym: Actually just invited him and everyone else is just being shitty to him.

660
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:24,089
Scott: maybe the only thing that Charlie Brown has it's his fault is he Fucks up cutting the holes in his ghost costume because again, no one will help him.

661
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,534
Scott: Well, he's also right, but it's like.

662
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:30,730
Scott: it's true that you know, most of his problems are caused by other people, right?

663
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:31,795
Rym: But he does also have his.

664
00:42:31,855 --> 00:42:34,070
Scott: there were two self-inflicted problems, right?

665
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,489
Scott: It's a victim blaming to say that he fell for the football kicking thing.

666
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:41,067
Scott: You're right because he was skeptical of it at first, but I guess he believed in the paper.

667
00:42:41,449 --> 00:42:43,717
Scott: Yeah But you know the cutting.

668
00:42:43,757 --> 00:42:46,170
Scott: he couldn't cut holes in his own got a ghost costume.

669
00:42:46,552 --> 00:42:49,890
Scott: So he is you know, kind of kind of doofy on his own, right?

670
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,120
Scott: Yeah, everyone else was able to cut holes in the ghost costume.

671
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,050
Rym: just fine, but then the final scene.

672
00:42:54,551 --> 00:43:01,250
Rym: So Charlie Brown's like yeah at a shitty Halloween like I always do and then like a bunch of rocks had a shitty costume.

673
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,889
Rym: They drew on my head and Linus is like great pumpkins coming next year.

674
00:43:05,412 --> 00:43:08,810
Scott: Well, he was like yeah at a shitty Halloween - I was freezing cold all night.

675
00:43:09,011 --> 00:43:11,761
Scott: Yeah, you know your sister got mad at me remember.

676
00:43:12,082 --> 00:43:15,856
Scott: and then you know, Charlie Brown is like, you know At least you got a great pumpkin.

677
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:17,683
Scott: Yeah, I got religion.

678
00:43:17,924 --> 00:43:20,796
Scott: Yeah, he's like no It's a great bumpkin still.

679
00:43:20,816 --> 00:43:25,039
Scott: Charlie Brown thought that Linus had finally come to set his senses But he had not.

680
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:26,330
Scott: he still was confident.

681
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:28,156
Rym: He does what woo people do.

682
00:43:28,196 --> 00:43:30,985
Rym: where Linus his whole arc is doubly doubles down.

683
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,864
Scott: Yeah, he doubles down and finds Oh, you thought the world was gonna end and it didn't.

684
00:43:35,186 --> 00:43:44,715
Rym: but specific In even to the point of making specific excuses like oh, I was an if instead of way wasn't sincere enough Yep, it was my fault.

685
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:58,424
Rym: So really this is just three like parables That all of which have the same moral welcome to the cruel realities of an evil world Like the end yet presented as this Halloween special.

686
00:43:58,464 --> 00:43:59,949
Scott: that's barely Halloween, right?

687
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,017
Scott: Yeah, not the Garfield once full hollow.

688
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:05,350
Scott: This one's like partially just happens to be during Halloween.

689
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:08,910
Rym: So on one end, I'm very pleased that this kind of thing was made and released.

690
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:16,890
Rym: But on the other hand, it's hard to recommend that Younger people today watch it because if you don't know these characters are it just feels a little bit capricious.

691
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:18,054
Scott: Well, it's also.

692
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:22,890
Scott: I just think that it's like like I said when I was a kid, it clearly just went over my head.

693
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:29,510
Scott: Yeah when I was Older it went under my head because I only saw the surface level of it.

694
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:37,200
Scott: And now that I see like the high brownness of it like it's secret high brow Right now.

695
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,209
Scott: I feel like it's wasted.

696
00:44:39,853 --> 00:44:44,210
Rym: I mean, we've got a person who tries to make you wouldn't understand the great the great pumpkin.

697
00:44:44,631 --> 00:44:50,330
Rym: We've got Charlie Brown a person who tries to make the best in light of the cruel realities of an evil world because that's just that.

698
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:51,489
Rym: That's what this is about.

699
00:44:51,831 --> 00:45:02,222
Rym: You've got the war veteran who can't enjoy the good parts of the real world like this Halloween party Because he's having PTSD and flashbacks to the horrors of war.

700
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,930
Rym: and then you've got the religious fanatic who?

701
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:08,960
Rym: Drags other people down with him and cannot be reasoned with and then it ends.

702
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:17,589
Scott: Yeah, so it's like what first appears to just be a secular generic Milk-toast, you know how commercial?

703
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:21,519
Scott: Commercialized holiday special to sell Snoopy crap.

704
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:22,160
Scott: right?

705
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:32,329
Scott: is actually this like three Aesop's fables Some gravels right that probably go over the heads of most people right and is actually has really something going on here.

706
00:45:33,893 --> 00:45:36,433
Scott: But also is It's not.

707
00:45:36,574 --> 00:45:39,344
Scott: it's like it's still timeless as long as Halloween is a holiday.

708
00:45:39,365 --> 00:45:46,110
Scott: Yeah, there is nothing That's not timeless about this except for maybe the World War one, but I guess that is not is also timeless.

709
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:47,598
Scott: Yeah, I mean war is war.

710
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,846
Scott: I still remember World War one.

711
00:45:48,866 --> 00:46:01,014
Rym: Yeah But I feel like people know what it's up with camel is - maybe but people not knowing enough about peanuts is Exactly There's long segments.

712
00:46:01,054 --> 00:46:04,246
Rym: We're like Linus uses the blue blanket to get the to mail the letter.

713
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:04,767
Scott: I guess like.

714
00:46:04,808 --> 00:46:11,107
Scott: I guess you could Introduce this could introduce you to peanuts, but then it might not be that effective.

715
00:46:11,287 --> 00:46:15,930
Scott: Yeah So like there's a joke like everyone knows is you pig pen?

716
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,191
Scott: It's like.

717
00:46:16,211 --> 00:46:20,170
Scott: well if you don't already know pig pen, you didn't see pig pen outside the ghost costume.

718
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:22,529
Scott: Yep, I guess you know, the name is pig pen.

719
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:28,630
Scott: So that gives you something cuz they say it Don't know about Charlie Brown in the football.

720
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:29,394
Scott: It's like.

721
00:46:29,696 --> 00:46:31,989
Scott: it's like they hit you with that football joke.

722
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:36,810
Rym: course If you don't know it still works because that introduces the fact that Lucy is a piece of shit.

723
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:38,304
Scott: It does but it's early.

724
00:46:38,324 --> 00:46:45,488
Scott: Brown is not Presented as if you already know the football joke and that you've seen Charlie Brown not kick a football before.

725
00:46:45,508 --> 00:46:47,638
Scott: and he's like I'll get it this time.

726
00:46:47,658 --> 00:46:56,701
Rym: Yep, and so you could still infer that The only one thing that really doesn't make sense is Linus and the blue Blanket because that and that is not explained to you at any point.

727
00:46:56,742 --> 00:47:01,742
Rym: That's just there anyway, everything else you could infer It's only 20 something minutes.

728
00:47:02,285 --> 00:47:06,203
Scott: So maybe You know put it on instance.

729
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,350
Scott: There's no television anymore.

730
00:47:08,012 --> 00:47:13,910
Scott: It's pretty easy to find on your calendar every Halloween to just set aside 20 something minutes.

731
00:47:14,693 --> 00:47:17,748
Rym: Yeah, if you've never seen it, I do recommend you go watch it.

732
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:19,013
Scott: Yeah, if nothing.

733
00:47:19,174 --> 00:47:24,515
Scott: but for if you only if you don't know anything about it can't just skip everything with the Snoopy parts And you'll still get something.

734
00:47:24,535 --> 00:47:33,050
Scott: the other parts on a pure animation level The Snoopy part is like legendary and worth the five minutes it takes or whatever.

735
00:47:38,845 --> 00:47:41,380
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
