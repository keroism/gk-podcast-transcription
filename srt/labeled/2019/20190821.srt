Scott: Stone Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:37,809
Rym: So I was feeling for a little bland Monday and got kind of a like a low-key cold like not quite even sick level just like low-key a Little flam and I was annoyed on Monday, and I'm like poking around and just doing my life.

7
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,770
Rym: and Then I'm in the living room, and I stepped in some water.

8
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,799
Scott: Okay, water in the house again water in the ceiling.

9
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:48,106
Rym: we gotta go back not in the ceiling this time.

10
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:49,229
Rym: so water by the TV.

11
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,385
Scott: Oh, that's a dangerous place where there'd be water with electricity.

12
00:00:52,405 --> 00:01:00,528
Rym: The rug is wet uh-huh, so I'm like I didn't spill anything and I look and I poke around and basically the radiator had just broken.

13
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:02,374
Scott: not you need The p-tach unit.

14
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:06,090
Rym: yeah the hvac unit the p-tach that has a radiator in it.

15
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,658
Rym: It's just a radiator in there.

16
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:11,958
Rym: Yeah, yeah It basically it looks like what happened.

17
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:12,641
Rym: is the what?

18
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,909
Rym: the thing that takes condensed water out of it?

19
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:19,198
Rym: We had clogged somewhere And it had completely filled with water.

20
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:19,338
Rym: the

21
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,790
Scott: water that should have been leaking out the side of the building to be mystery water on Someone's head was slowly

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,024
Rym: In the apartment

23
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:26,990
Scott: was filling in your house

24
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:42,129
Rym: And it looks like it been doing this for a while and it eventually because it was so humid Only like this like recently as humid consistently long enough that it actually filled that reservoir Entirely and then just started leaking everywhere.

25
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:49,029
Rym: Luckily because that's a very self-contained thing They just came in and like completely fixed it and like replaced a bunch of parts, and I'm good to go.

26
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:51,396
Rym: So it wasn't like the ceiling leakage.

27
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:55,190
Rym: it actually was resolved quickly and did not actually cause any damage.

28
00:01:56,034 --> 00:02:02,079
Rym: I just had to leave the rug out to like dry before I put everything back And it was an opportunity to dust behind the TV.

29
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:09,630
Rym: I haven't dusted under there in like four or five years All right, so you got any news on this Wednesday.

30
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:17,230
Scott: I mean, it's not exactly any animation or comic news, but I guess it's close enough.

31
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:21,030
Scott: So the Hugo Awards happened right?

32
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,221
Scott: And it seems that you know don't they happen it.

33
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:25,630
Scott: those the ones happen at Worldcon.

34
00:02:26,891 --> 00:02:32,370
Scott: Yes Worldcon in Dublin this time double this time, okay, so you know there was some drama in the past.

35
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,515
Rym: There's always some drama at Worldcon.

36
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:36,740
Scott: the most drama ish con on earth.

00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:40,108
Rym: second most drama ish non anime con on her.

38
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:58,240
Scott: anyway You know there was always drama involving Hugo Awards But it seems that the terms of Hugo Awards that the the good side has managed to win out And this time they have won even more than in the past The Hugo Award for what best related work, I believe

39
00:02:58,581 --> 00:02:59,944
Rym: yep best related work has

40
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:06,123
Scott: been given to awarded to Archive of our own which is also known as a o3.

41
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:17,976
Scott: so if you don't know Archive of our own is basically the number one premier central like hub of fan fiction Ever right?

42
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:21,890
Scott: it's like all the fan is like the fan fiction community above all others.

43
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:22,777
Scott: You know it's like.

44
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:28,340
Scott: you know if it was 1996 this would be the geocities of fanfiction.

45
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,769
Rym: yeah with it does have all of the drama you might expect.

46
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:32,210
Scott: oh, yeah.

47
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:38,785
Scott: But you know even despite whatever you may you know think about fan fictions right.

48
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:48,270
Scott: the point is is that hey a A lot of people that you consider you know to be like quote real writers write a fucking lot of fan fiction.

49
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:49,013
Scott: Right?

50
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:53,250
Scott: someone who's like job it is to write say spider-man comics.

51
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:55,176
Scott: They're just writing fanfiction for a living.

52
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:56,821
Scott: basically they didn't invent spider-man.

53
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:57,303
Scott: They're not.

54
00:03:57,463 --> 00:04:04,115
Scott: you know Stanley died right now Although they're writing all spider-man all every Marvel But they're writing canonical fiction.

55
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:08,747
Scott: sure every Marvel movie that you have seen is basically fan fiction right.

56
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:09,569
Scott: It's just great.

57
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:12,540
Scott: It's like this magic wand.

58
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:21,890
Rym: it is entirely possible that some of the works You've just talked about were made by people who are not in fact fans of the subject matter So they might not be fanfiction.

59
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:30,370
Scott: But also that you know regardless of the legitimacy of fanfiction which it is super legitimate although not all of it may be high-quality.

60
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:37,390
Scott: The number of quote real right because everyone who writes is a real writer.

61
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:48,776
Scott: Number of writers who are even professional or even amateur or whatever Got their start writing a lot of fucking fan fiction Right and wet the Hugo Awards.

62
00:04:48,817 --> 00:05:02,710
Scott: what happened is after they gave the award you know to archive of our own Right they asked anyone in the crowd a room full of basically sci-fi Fantasy authors and such people who care about Hugo Awards or we're going you know nominated for them.

63
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,188
Scott: They were voting on them and stuff like that.

64
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:05,534
Scott: Please stand up.

65
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:18,022
Scott: if you know your archive of your own like you know you're a member of the community if you did stuff there If it you know impacted you and cetera and a lot of fucking people stood up Like at the room, so it's basically like this.

66
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:26,755
Scott: You know the award didn't go to a single You know individual or anything like that, but it acknowledged Fanfiction is legit is not?

67
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:31,968
Scott: you know something to be looked down upon or yep scraped away.

68
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:38,049
Rym: I mean we've all Made fun of things like Sailor Moon saves the furries and that kind of thing.

69
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:44,130
Scott: I think fanfiction people also do yeah, right, but at the end of the day you're writing stories.

70
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:52,409
Scott: Yeah Just cuz your characters might be characters that someone else thought of and you modified or kept the same or added to or you know You're well.

71
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,770
Rym: I mean what we always say even if you make some to be honest some hot garbage at least you made something.

72
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:06,125
Scott: Yeah anyone who made even the crappiest fanfiction made more than someone who sat around making nothing and just playing games and Reading and watching yep.

73
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:19,287
Rym: also I get the impression that a lot of the drama and the fanfiction community is mostly people who don't actually write much fanfiction beefing with people who do write fanfiction Because they want the fiction to go differently and they don't want to write it themselves.

74
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:19,809
Scott: who knows?

75
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:28,808
Rym: So in some other news you may have seen all this spider-man stuff and I don't want to talk about it too much because I don't really care that much but basically Disney and Sony.

76
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,882
Rym: Uh Some of the few remaining entertainment companies, right?

77
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:36,210
Scott: So if you don't know brief briefly, right?

78
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,450
Scott: There's all the projects all the Marvel characters, you know, right?

79
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,795
Scott: Almost all of them belong to Marvel.

80
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:45,826
Scott: Yeah Disney because that's where they started and no one else ever really bought them away.

81
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:46,368
Scott: Yeah, right.

82
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:49,777
Scott: However Fox is making x-men movies.

83
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:59,970
Scott: They had those rights and they kept making them and as long as they kept x-men movies, which I like none of Do I like any x-men movie?

84
00:07:02,182 --> 00:07:04,760
Rym: Do I like any x-men anything other than the original?

85
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,653
Rym: Oh, well, not the original the cartoon the Fox cartoon.

86
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:09,302
Scott: There are x-men things I like.

87
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:11,613
Rym: I like a few of the story arcs in the comics.

88
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:13,160
Rym: I like individual characters.

89
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,180
Scott: Anyway, the point is that that was Fox but Fox is now Disney.

90
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:25,200
Scott: Yeah, so that has been rejoined heard right, but someone's fantastic for I don't know what the fuck happened with that garbage.

91
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:26,731
Scott: And then spider-man.

92
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:29,846
Scott: spider-man was hanging at Sony But they reached some sort of.

93
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:41,620
Scott: they reached some sort of agreement at some point that I don't know the details of that allowed Spider-man to appear and I actually saw it wasn't on a plane or was it on TV or someone happened to be near a TV.

94
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:42,242
Scott: I saw.

95
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,150
Scott: not I don't know what it was.

96
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:54,047
Scott: It must have been like the end of a Marvel movie I don't even fucking know which one it was and it was like Iron Man and then like Peter Parker was there and he was Really young.

97
00:07:54,067 --> 00:08:01,114
Scott: he was like teenage Peter Parker version and You know Iron Man was like, oh come be an Avenger and spider-man was like nah.

98
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:02,800
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's I saw that one under there.

99
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:03,951
Scott: I saw that one scene.

100
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:04,556
Scott: That's all I saw.

101
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:16,255
Rym: So in a world where so at some point they reached an agreement that allowed spider-man to be in the same movies in a world Where spider-man into the spider-verse doesn't exist that might be the best spider-man movie.

102
00:08:16,516 --> 00:08:16,817
Scott: I don't know.

103
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:17,420
Scott: I didn't see it.

104
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,827
Scott: Anyway, I only saw that one scene.

105
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:26,537
Scott: the point is that Sony obviously is still under that agreement had the right to make other spider-man movies because they made.

106
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:32,840
Rym: as you said Spider-man to the spider-verse like I cannot express enough is the best spider-man movie ever made.

107
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,692
Rym: Maybe it's one of the better movies ever made.

108
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:39,508
Scott: No, no, no, it's one of the better movies Better superhero movies ever.

109
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:41,193
Rym: It's the best ever.

110
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:42,097
Scott: I don't know about that.

111
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,746
Scott: It depends Counts as a superhero movie.

112
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:47,713
Scott: Yeah, is that even a genre?

113
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:52,411
Scott: Yeah, or is it just like, you know Any sci-fi movie where someone is powerful.

114
00:08:52,511 --> 00:09:00,768
Scott: It's like best spider movie a superhero movie because Maybe Iron Monkey is right.

115
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,257
Scott: It's like what you know, we're not gonna talk about that right now.

116
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:16,046
Scott: Yeah The point is the news that everyone's yapping about is that there seems to be some breakup of disagreement and spider-man may have to exit Marvel movies and a bunch of fanboys or Non-fan just fan.

117
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:20,846
Scott: people in general are upset about this and I don't give a shit cuz I Watching his fucking movie.

118
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:21,489
Rym: Here's a good.

119
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,756
Rym: Here's a pretty good take on this.

120
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:28,409
Rym: So basically Disney is now a Monopoly on pop culture and needs to be broken up.

121
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,393
Rym: I mean stop.

122
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:33,069
Scott: that is also true for Several other companies need to be broken up.

123
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:41,070
Scott: the Google but the Apple Amazon almost of all Yes is merging with like Viacom.

124
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,960
Rym: that should be stopped yeah, but forget about that.

125
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:46,522
Scott: Disney right now because Disney is on the list List.

126
00:09:46,783 --> 00:10:01,229
Rym: Disney in particular has a lot of just general goodwill among regular people And I believe the company is deeply taking advantage of that to pit Disney fans Against the remaining holdouts to the Disney Empire.

127
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:15,742
Rym: I feel like Disney is relying on the fact that Their fans will defend their monopoly because they're more excited about Star Wars Potentially being able to cross over with Disney shit and all these like fan stuff They want.

128
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:20,541
Rym: they care about that way more than they care about a healthy entertainment ecosystem with competition Mm-hmm.

129
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:24,512
Rym: So I think Disney is kind of actively weaponizing Disney fans.

130
00:10:24,813 --> 00:10:27,440
Scott: Well, it's crazy how you know the fans, right?

131
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:30,530
Scott: It's like they really want things to happen.

132
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,220
Scott: They'd be like, oh my god Star Wars crossover with the thing.

133
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,690
Scott: Oh my god, please make it happen.

134
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:43,600
Scott: And then when it happens, they'll be like, whoo Whoo and they'll still spend the money on it and then right and then the next time around Right.

135
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:47,115
Scott: and I basically I basically never fall for that.

136
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:48,360
Scott: I'm always like right.

137
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,780
Scott: It's like I think I remember a time where someone was like, hey Scott, you like Megaman you like board games.

138
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,985
Scott: They're making a Megaman board game.

139
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:55,190
Rym: That game is guaranteed bad.

140
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,817
Scott: And I said immediately that's garbage.

141
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:57,500
Scott: I don't give a shit.

142
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,968
Scott: I can tell us garbage rat right?

143
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,991
Scott: Whereas I think most fans would be like, oh, yeah That logic would be correct for most fans.

144
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:17,500
Scott: but yet just like Yesterday, I found myself doing the normal fan thing where they're like, hey, we're making matrix 4 and I'm like, all right Yeah, yeah, just take me with your garbage.

145
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:23,131
Scott: Second movie Reason you skip two numbers you just take my money.

146
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:24,275
Rym: He's rigid your wallet.

147
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:25,319
Rym: You slap down the table like.

148
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,143
Scott: but It's like.

149
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:34,367
Scott: I'm vulnerable, but I think I'm just less vulnerable than the other fans Frequently vulnerable to be fair.

150
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,797
Rym: The matrix was a phenomenal movie and I look forward to there being a sequel.

151
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:42,051
Scott: Yes Three times that's in under a minute.

152
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,696
Rym: That's one of my most go-to jokes.

153
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:53,900
Scott: The point is You know even being less vulnerable, I believe at least about myself perhaps egotistically, you know to this sort of phenomenon.

154
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,573
Scott: I think that you know, I can still occasionally vulnerable.

155
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:03,739
Scott: so I can understand, you know That feeling I have when I see matrix 4 and I'm like up you got me.

156
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:08,300
Scott: It must be what people feel like who like superhero movies like every fucking time

157
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:18,700
Rym: yep, but that the problem here is just that Disney is going to continue to get a huge amount of support and a huge number of people are going to

158
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,002
Scott: Pointedly

159
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:30,814
Rym: ignore the real dangers of this monopoly to our pop culture and just to the entertainment industry as a whole Because they want these crossover fan things to happen.

160
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:47,100
Scott: and bringing it back to my first news stick away from the big-time Industry arts and stay in the fanfiction fanzone in the indie arts and you won't have these issues Particularly when it comes to tabletop RPGs.

161
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,579
Rym: That's for a different time.

162
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:51,590
Rym: This is Wednesday.

163
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:59,120
Rym: news is related to animation But as you know my little pony which was a pretty phenomenal success all things considered it ended its end like it's over.

164
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:00,767
Rym: They're gonna milk it forever.

165
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:01,449
Rym: They'll probably.

166
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:03,980
Rym: they'll probably do another series someday in the future.

167
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:14,560
Scott: Like I mean, they're not gonna kill off a successful money-making property, but the TV show That airs on whatever the fuck that channel is called these days the Pirate Bay.

168
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,320
Scott: Yeah, it's not called whatever it was the hub or whatever the fuck it was called when yeah, we talked about.

169
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,372
Scott: I only watch like three to four seasons and maybe three.

170
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:24,140
Rym: I've seen all but the last two seasons.

171
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:26,691
Scott: I'll maybe one day go back and watch.

172
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:28,760
Scott: actually the point is the show's ending.

173
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,572
Scott: Yeah, the show's ending but the property will live on.

174
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:33,340
Scott: who knows how long the comic will gone.

175
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,390
Rym: Yeah, just like Adventure Time like Adventure Time is not gonna disappear.

176
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,756
Rym: Adventure Time is a cornerstone of like animation Which reminds me?

177
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,805
Scott: I was listening to Guaranteed audio.

178
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,660
Scott: Oh, they reviewed a podcast that almost never has an episode.

179
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:58,026
Scott: They talked about the recently Netflix released Rocco's modern life movie.

180
00:13:58,367 --> 00:13:59,049
Rym: Oh, I was.

181
00:13:59,069 --> 00:13:59,531
Rym: oh we were.

182
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,376
Rym: we should do it the next Wednesday show on that.

183
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:12,111
Scott: invaders in movie Yeah, and they talked about how invaders in was on Nickelodeon for like as long as a fart Yeah, and meanwhile they've been selling merch for the thing for like 20.

184
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:13,996
Rym: that's it my little pony.

185
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:15,540
Scott: and my little pony is.

186
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,664
Scott: It's like it doesn't have they don't?

187
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:21,020
Scott: they weighed way more my little pony seasons that it ever deserved no matter how good it was.

188
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:28,888
Scott: Yeah Cuz you only needed like two and then it's you just get enough to have people interested in the property and then you can just Sell merch forever.

189
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:31,666
Scott: You don't need to actually make Story shit.

190
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:37,611
Rym: Yep, but speaking of fan stuff So the fans of my little pony had made BronyCon.

191
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:42,919
Scott: BronyCon's been around as long as the show's been around pretty much 2011 hundred people attended.

192
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:52,098
Rym: supposedly the most recent one had 10,000 attendees But the not the site tell all the citations of that are not like they're gone.

193
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:57,560
Rym: Mm-hmm I don't necessarily trust it but BronyCon is also ending and apparently sense.

194
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:00,875
Scott: Yeah, it's funny because when's the last one gonna be?

195
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:01,779
Rym: it already happened.

196
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:03,552
Rym: Previous one was the last one.

197
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:04,419
Scott: so it is already done.

198
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:09,620
Rym: So what's funny is at the last one they basically announced the dates for the next two BronyCon's.

199
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:12,150
Scott: Oh, and then they changed their mind right after that.

200
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,137
Rym: They're like, oh, yeah, BronyCon's got gone.

201
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:16,218
Rym: big mistake I'm at the two times ago.

202
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:19,091
Rym: so they so people knew that the one that was coming up.

203
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:33,676
Rym: that just happened was the last one and Part of the reason it had been canceled was that starting in 2015 attendance declined at a steady rate Partly because it moved like it moved to Baltimore and then it cuz it was too big to fit anywhere

204
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:33,937
Scott: else

205
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:35,382
Rym: and then it moved Dates.

206
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:38,900
Rym: Baltimore was desperate to get any convention after Otakon left.

207
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:40,185
Rym: There's a lot going on.

208
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:43,760
Scott: I have a convention in Baltimore to give me that convention center real cheap, and I'll go right in there.

209
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:45,580
Scott: Yeah, you got to lower the price a lot.

210
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:50,240
Rym: I don't know how much construction happened because that convention center had some structural issues.

211
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,826
Rym: I don't know what this.

212
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:56,940
Scott: I actually do not know what the state I mean it has its issues, but it's still enormous space and it's not big enough for our convention.

213
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,766
Scott: We could use one room.

214
00:15:57,786 --> 00:15:59,258
Rym: Yeah, but also one of those rooms.

215
00:15:59,278 --> 00:15:59,901
Scott: We're good This.

216
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:11,275
Rym: this was a. this is a moderately unpopular opinion, but when PAX first announced there's gonna be a PAX East I would but The Baltimore Convention Center was literally the best possible place to put it.

217
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:12,720
Rym: and they put it in Boston.

218
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,231
Rym: I remember being pissed about it.

219
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:15,379
Rym: I'm still pissed about it.

220
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,640
Rym: But now the BCC is pretty good, but back then it had a lot more problems.

221
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:23,518
Scott: But the Baltimore first PAX East was in the Heinz.

222
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:35,809
Rym: Awful, but the Baltimore Convention Center for all of its like problems of age the physical space is Literally one of the best possible spaces for a nerd convention.

223
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,774
Rym: Just the way it was laid out.

224
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:42,106
Rym: like no other convention center is like that And it's kind of a shame.

225
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:45,220
Scott: But anyway, you know to kind of left that building a long time ago already.

226
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:53,174
Rym: so Bronycon was declining in attendance rapidly because as Popular as My Little Pony was.

227
00:16:53,194 --> 00:17:00,915
Rym: it is really hard to dedicate a fan convention of size to not just one Genre, not just one thing.

228
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:07,114
Scott: Yeah one IP right and usually there are conventions like say BotCon I'm pretty sure is still going.

229
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:08,137
Scott: I haven't heard that it died.

230
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:11,369
Scott: Yeah, but just about transformers, but it's not a big convention.

231
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,517
Scott: It's kind of you know, it's medium smallish.

232
00:17:13,577 --> 00:17:14,621
Scott: It's not a big thing.

233
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:16,045
Rym: and Star Wars Celebration.

234
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,933
Rym: Well, it's just Star Wars Star Wars.

235
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:20,618
Scott: doesn't that only happen every two years?

236
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,980
Scott: and isn't it also like run by Disney like it's official stuff It's like super official.

237
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:32,444
Rym: Yeah, so Basically what happened is this con was just declining in attendance and rather than downscaling They were just gonna shut it down.

238
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:38,566
Rym: But because people knew was the last one I think the last one was the highest attended one ever.

239
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:41,233
Scott: Oh Okay, not rich.

240
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:47,470
Scott: They should say this is the last packs and everyone goes up and then just kidding except packs already sells out.

241
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,595
Scott: yeah, and Last news.

242
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,470
Scott: I can see that phenomena actually is happening.

243
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:56,264
Scott: This year is the 30th and fine.

244
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:56,686
Scott: It's right.

245
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:57,490
Scott: the week after packs.

246
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:03,888
Scott: This year is the 30th and final New York City century, which is not the greatest bike ride in the universe.

247
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:08,141
Scott: Yep But if it's the last one, but it's like it's the fucking last one.

248
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:09,927
Scott: So I think people are gonna come out in droves.

249
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:13,589
Rym: I intend to be able to go to the last packs.

250
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:17,945
Scott: You Have to survive yeah, I.

251
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:20,579
Rym: So we actually here's an over/under.

252
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:22,949
Rym: will we outlive packs or packs outlive us?

253
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,310
Scott: Well, I think it's more of a question of the problem.

254
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:31,650
Scott: We outlive Mike and Jerry and we'll packs well penny arcade corporation under or outlive them.

255
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:42,337
Rym: You know five or six years ago just based on their per not I would have assumed we would outlive them but they're both a lot more fit than they used to be and like no one is There is nobody who can.

256
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:46,127
Scott: there is no more Robert coup to keep Mike from getting a motorcycle.

257
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:47,210
Rym: that is true.

258
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:50,424
Rym: Why does he not realize he can just buy a motorcycle?

259
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:51,168
Scott: don't tell him.

260
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:52,896
Rym: no Nobody nobody.

261
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:54,043
Rym: tell my crew like that.

262
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:54,988
Rym: He can buy a motorcycle.

263
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:57,440
Rym: Good God That would be the last.

264
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:58,950
Scott: or do do tell.

265
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:01,413
Scott: The point is right.

266
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:10,719
Scott: the penny arcade company the convention culture in general those two jerks us two jerks Right, it's like which of these things will die first.

267
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,442
Rym: so race against.

268
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:12,225
Scott: none of them.

269
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,730
Scott: None of them are immortal.

270
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:15,330
Rym: Nothing lasts forever.

271
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:22,189
Rym: But packs as a convention has done a good job of trying to make a structure that will outlive the people that created it.

272
00:19:22,691 --> 00:19:24,135
Rym: Anime cons in particular.

273
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:25,519
Scott: it has yet to be tested.

274
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:33,163
Scott: Oh, yeah, but that's like having a backup plan and you've never done a restore Yep, but they're trying most fan cons don't.

275
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:34,567
Scott: even I got a bunch of backup tastes.

276
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:35,329
Scott: Have you looked at him?

277
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:38,479
Rym: No But most fan cons are like backup tapes.

278
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,850
Rym: our con chairs been the con chair for 40 years he will live forever.

279
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:44,829
Rym: Why do we need to teach anyone else how to do this job?

280
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:55,245
Rym: but uh brony con and that kind of con I've we've like pointedly as GeekNights like a lot of these Single-issue cons try to get us to appear.

281
00:19:55,265 --> 00:20:00,068
Rym: I Just cannot make that specific amount of content.

282
00:20:01,094 --> 00:20:05,394
Rym: But more to the point when it comes to fan stuff I see this happen a lot.

283
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:13,666
Rym: when a particular fandom gets very big a huge ecosystem of fan podcasts and fan video analysis things appear.

284
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:20,638
Rym: but Too many of the people who make those sorts of things get way too Invested in that thing growing forever.

285
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,730
Rym: and I see them like every time this kind of thing happens.

286
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:31,270
Rym: You see like a whole swath of podcasters Like not know what to do with themselves and aren't able to like make a show about something else.

287
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:39,239
Scott: Well, I mean even we have GeekNights where we have so much things that we can podcast about with our wide variety in four Shows we run out of ideas.

288
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,750
Scott: I remember in the earliest days of podcasting I wouldn't listen to them because they didn't care about Harry Potter.

289
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:52,348
Scott: but I saw a lot of Harry Potter podcasts in the mid 2000s, you know and All of them quote-unquote pod faded because they ran in our fucking material.

290
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:54,337
Scott: Yep It's like even if they're another book.

291
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:58,112
Scott: that was before all the books are out, but it's like yeah What do you?

292
00:20:58,152 --> 00:21:00,361
Scott: how many podcasts you gonna make between books?

293
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:02,530
Scott: It's like you already talked the shit out of that book.

294
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:05,302
Scott: How many Harry Potter news is there per week per month?

295
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:07,210
Scott: We need to make one podcast per book.

296
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:09,470
Scott: It's like we will wait a year for another episode of your podcast.

297
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,436
Rym: It's like I wonder if there are still.

298
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:15,769
Rym: firefly was the biggest one for that firefly fancraft was coming out.

299
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:17,174
Rym: Yeah I wonder.

300
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:17,957
Rym: okay.

301
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:18,980
Rym: Yeah, I think the last.

302
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:21,670
Rym: I don't think there are any more Firefly podcast, right?

303
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,101
Scott: You could do a my little pony podcast and you could.

304
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:28,030
Scott: you know, there are still one season of episodes left, right?

305
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,772
Scott: Yep, right.

306
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:33,590
Scott: You can talk about those you can talk about, you know, there have been different other you can about some merch stuff.

307
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:35,470
Scott: There was that card game that came out at one point.

308
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:52,942
Rym: But you turn into just like comics come out every month pretty consistently turn into what all those firefly things turn into which were literally just scraping the bottom of the barrel of any news like ah, No, no, but at least for something like my little pony.

309
00:21:52,982 --> 00:21:54,570
Scott: there is stuff that comes out, right?

310
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,505
Rym: I mean, I guess the best you could do is do a. I mean look we have even finished.

311
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,650
Rym: GeekNights presents utenna.

312
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:01,596
Rym: No, so we were doing.

313
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:05,830
Scott: the other thing that you can do in that situation is you can resort to reporting on the meta.

314
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:11,428
Rym: Right, so that's what all those firefly podcast turned into and they just turned into like the community meta like.

315
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:12,130
Scott: so it's like.

316
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,241
Scott: Oh, you know check out someone made this awesome rarity cosplay.

317
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,244
Scott: Oh check this out.

318
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:18,010
Scott: Someone made this awesome Applejack quill.

319
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,814
Rym: So, you know, it's funny.

320
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:22,110
Scott: Oh so and so is having a meet-up in this town.

321
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,557
Rym: I looked at photos of the last BronyCon.

322
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:29,070
Rym: the far majority of the cosplay I saw was just random anime con crap.

323
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:30,646
Rym: Nothing to do with my little pony.

324
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:37,585
Scott: No So yeah I guess I haven't seen the too much pony cosplay at other cons that I go to.

325
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,732
Scott: they do have cosplay even though I used to see a bunch.

326
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:44,248
Rym: I see the most still in magfest but mostly in like the people who are going to like the.

327
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:49,223
Rym: not because Basically have raves but I see it a lot in the concert areas and I don't see it a lot in the rest of the con.

328
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:51,057
Scott: That's where there's a lot of room.

329
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:56,700
Rym: Yeah, so, uh last Many I feel like the anime community just sort of forgot this.

330
00:22:56,841 --> 00:23:04,430
Rym: but it was sort of an open secret a long time ago that Neil Gaiman basically penned the English adaptation of Princess Mononoke.

331
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:08,984
Scott: See, I didn't even know I didn't know that I mean those, you know manga.

332
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,970
Rym: I feel like we've talked about this on GeekNights.

333
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:12,677
Scott: You know translations.

334
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:21,877
Scott: if people don't realize this do have writers, right, you know It's usually the translator does sort of like, you know Just turning it into like what is the meaning?

335
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:30,050
Scott: and then the writer will sort of edit slash rewrite it and say, okay That means that let me rewrite that sentence in a better way, right?

336
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,683
Scott: And that's what the writers job is when you're doing an adaptation.

337
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:33,929
Scott: Yeah that right, you know.

338
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:42,854
Scott: Um Yeah, anyway, so, you know, I knew that somebody did this for pretty much any Anime movie ever.

339
00:23:42,975 --> 00:23:47,290
Scott: that's been translated right, but you never think a famous person would have that job.

340
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:55,124
Scott: Like name name the English writer of like any manga or other anime like yeah I guess someone someone did it for Naruto.

341
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:55,728
Scott: who the hell did it?

342
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:04,159
Rym: But like I feel like there was a person when anime nerds just knew it was one of those things people would talk about like I did not know this.

343
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,185
Rym: Okay, interesting.

344
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:18,610
Rym: So I Feel like everyone forgot because the news of this broke again recently and I saw a whole bunch of people losing the shit about it Which is really funny, but Neil gave me I didn't know about it before but why would I lose my shit about it?

345
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:27,513
Rym: So but there is some interesting stuff because one thing that I never knew Because this is one of those things like before the internet was like kind of what it is today You could.

346
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:31,170
Rym: it was often hard to research these kinds of things to find out the full story.

347
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:37,748
Rym: There's a lot of like Tribal knowledge in the anime community that like no one can go research.

348
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:43,548
Rym: Hmm So Neil Gaiman started talking about it like now and revealed some things.

349
00:24:43,588 --> 00:24:44,210
Rym: I didn't know so.

350
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,237
Rym: So now I'm yeah on Twitter.

351
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:54,710
Rym: Now we know why this wasn't quote open secret and like why it was seen as this like sort of secret knowledge.

352
00:24:55,073 --> 00:24:55,497
Scott: I'm just gonna.

353
00:24:55,518 --> 00:25:09,350
Scott: I mean I did know that when Disney was a debt did have the license and was adapting the Ghibli movies for the US that pretty much for every job Involved they were hiring like top tier famous people all the voice actors they got for those things.

354
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:12,439
Scott: Super famous people not the regular anime voice actor.

355
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:20,390
Rym: and it's right it showed because those dubs they had their problems, but they were Light years beyond the best like traditional anime dub in the rest.

356
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,407
Scott: So all those Ghibli's that Disney had adapted as you know, not that G kids do a bad job.

357
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:32,490
Scott: They do a great job Yeah, but Disney when they did it, they hired the famous just famous people cuz remember back like Disney did this through Miramax.

358
00:25:32,591 --> 00:25:33,577
Rym: They didn't do it directly.

359
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,725
Scott: No, but it's Disney.

360
00:25:35,128 --> 00:25:39,329
Rym: So I'm just gonna read Neil Gaiman's tweet because it's actually fascinating.

361
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:40,876
Rym: now We know why this was.

362
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,020
Rym: scenes like a weird secret.

363
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,774
Rym: quote my biggest secret Biggest secret.

364
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,526
Rym: Wow studio Ghibli asked for some of not about his biggest secret.

365
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:50,790
Scott: isn't something that happened if I'm gonna?

366
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:55,150
Rym: Yeah, I met these two jerks and this guy named Steve.

367
00:25:57,531 --> 00:26:00,520
Rym: Studio Ghibli asked for some of the Miramax execs.

368
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,627
Scott: I forget the guy who fell asleep while I was telling my story.

369
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:02,989
Scott: How rude.

370
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:09,750
Rym: Studio Ghibli asked for some of the Miramax execs to be removed from the poster and credits.

371
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:12,337
Scott: Okay, the execs he's not an exec.

372
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:14,181
Rym: He was in this purpose.

373
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:16,547
Rym: Here's the thing the execs looked at.

374
00:26:16,648 --> 00:26:24,291
Rym: all the names Determined that theirs would remain and realize that mine was contractually expendable Mm-hmm.

375
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:33,949
Rym: So basically the Ghibli wanted to reduce the number of English names and put more Ghibli names on Like the posters and in the front credits and all that stuff.

376
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:41,435
Rym: So the executives were like I'm not taking my fucking name off of this and they basically removed all the names of people Who did not have contracts.

377
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:46,210
Rym: that specifically gave them the rights to be in the credits and Neil Gaiman was one of those people.

378
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:48,439
Rym: They took his name fucking off of it ever like.

379
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:49,584
Rym: they took it off of everything they could.

380
00:26:49,604 --> 00:26:50,810
Rym: Okay, that's it.

381
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,513
Rym: That's the story.

382
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:52,800
Scott: It couldn't fit another name on there.

383
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,424
Scott: Is not a room.

384
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,168
Rym: No, they were.

385
00:26:54,188 --> 00:26:58,759
Rym: the Ghibli executives wanted fewer American names.

386
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,260
Rym: Mm-hmm.

387
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,864
Rym: Like that's just something they wanted.

388
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:01,626
Rym: Okay.

389
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:03,450
Scott: Why didn't they just say no American names?

390
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,032
Scott: That's what.

391
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:06,867
Scott: if I was Studio Ghibli, I'd be like you can't put your fucking name on that.

392
00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:07,370
Scott: We made it.

393
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,720
Scott: You're just adapting it and putting it out there in English.

394
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:11,890
Scott: You don't get to put any fucking names on it assholes.

395
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,655
Rym: Yeah, this was part of the negotiations.

396
00:27:13,695 --> 00:27:14,036
Scott: Yeah.

397
00:27:14,136 --> 00:27:17,767
Rym: Well, uh, so there's a further thing here.

398
00:27:17,827 --> 00:27:18,850
Rym: That is crazy.

399
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,458
Scott: Okay, that doesn't see cuz that part just is normal Hollywood bullshit.

400
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:28,066
Rym: Neil Gaiman also confirmed that he received the opportunity upon recommendation from Quentin Tarantino.

401
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:29,835
Scott: Apparently why was even?

402
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:31,420
Scott: why did he not have anything to do with?

403
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,390
Rym: so the rumor was Miramax went to Quentin Tarantino.

404
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,140
Rym: Okay, who said what?

405
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:39,230
Rym: No go to Neil Gaiman?

406
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,209
Rym: Okay, so Adam Turley asked Neil Gaiman.

407
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:47,786
Rym: Is it true that they first asked Quentin Tarantino who then suggested you instead?

408
00:27:48,088 --> 00:27:48,750
Rym: and Neil Gaiman?

409
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:54,347
Rym: Official Twitter account said yes Okay, so they went to Quentin Tarantino.

410
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:56,355
Scott: who said What?

411
00:27:56,776 --> 00:28:01,049
Rym: I get the impression that Quentin Tarantino's reaction to this was about the same as yours like.

412
00:28:05,512 --> 00:28:12,829
Rym: Somehow this became news and it became fascinating news but anyway It's time for.

413
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:20,888
Rym: So things of the day.

414
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:28,660
Rym: this is a Japanese YouTube channel and Basically, it is a professional pianist performing in her house.

415
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,073
Rym: It looks like Chopin's a - like what is your palms works?

416
00:28:32,374 --> 00:28:33,780
Scott: You'll know like a good show fun.

417
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:35,586
Rym: Yeah, you'll know which one it is.

418
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:37,152
Rym: It's the one that everyone knows.

419
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:38,476
Rym: Yeah, you'll hear it.

420
00:28:38,496 --> 00:28:39,480
Rym: You'll be like, oh that song.

421
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,588
Scott: Okay, so what's special about this thing of the day then?

422
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:44,599
Rym: so the video doesn't start with the pianist.

423
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:48,133
Rym: It starts in her house and there's there's another.

424
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:51,523
Rym: there's someone else in the house and this person's like this.

425
00:28:51,804 --> 00:29:02,139
Rym: they're going around doing stuff and they're slowly moving toward the room where the where the practice session is happening and They interfere with the practice.

426
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,263
Scott: Okay,

427
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:22,164
Rym: and this happens several times because this is in fact a video of the cat one of her two cats Getting bored and Apparently is pissed that she is practicing the piano instead of playing with him and slowly goes into the room waits for his moment Jumps up on the key

428
00:29:22,204 --> 00:29:22,966
Scott: on the piano

429
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:26,977
Rym: and messes up the performance over and over and over again.

430
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:27,860
Scott: This is normal cat shit.

431
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,148
Rym: Yep, it's really really really cute.

432
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,357
Rym: Okay, that's my thing of the day.

433
00:29:32,377 --> 00:29:45,800
Scott: All right, so If you've ever seen anyone play drums There's a very important thing next to drums almost always That people maybe who aren't musicians don't pay enough attention to and those are cymbals.

434
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,663
Scott: Yeah, right.

435
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:48,349
Scott: Usually think about cymbals.

436
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:52,878
Scott: you think about like a marching band with a guy banging two cymbals together like Yeah, right.

437
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:58,600
Rym: So what I can say is when we were in marching band in high school the cymbals that we care that the band would carry.

438
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:06,320
Rym: Those cost more than any other instrument the school owned except for a handful of silver French horns.

439
00:30:06,983 --> 00:30:17,427
Scott: But also, you know cymbals are like one of the most important instruments There are that I guess I don't get enough credit like I'm like even like, you know Don't that's part.

440
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:17,971
Scott: Yes.

441
00:30:18,353 --> 00:30:19,560
Rym: That's part is symbols.

442
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,060
Rym: Well percussion in general if you're not a musician it off and it often blends into the background.

443
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:25,694
Rym: You don't realize how important it is.

444
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:26,037
Scott: Think about.

445
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:31,840
Scott: well I think it's just that like if someone's playing guitar you go ah guitar so it's playing bass You're like wicked bass solo, right?

446
00:30:32,223 --> 00:30:39,820
Scott: But it's like if someone plays a drum solo you go You hear a drum set Drum solo, even though there's plenty of and and all kinds of in there.

447
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,520
Rym: Well, depending on the drum set there could be like 14 different instruments that that one person is playing.

448
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:47,270
Scott: And but no one does a cymbal solo, right?

449
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:47,973
Scott: So it's not.

450
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:49,880
Rym: well, it's hard to do a cymbal solo.

451
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:51,800
Scott: Uh, you could do pretty good stuff.

452
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,815
Scott: Anyway, well and a lot of cymbals aren't even called cymbals.

453
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:55,800
Scott: like you someone's got a hi-hat.

454
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,896
Scott: That's fucking cymbals, but you know and say, you know, it's don't you don't call it cymbals.

455
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:00,578
Scott: Go ahead.

456
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:04,719
Rym: anyway Buddy has done some cymbal solos.

457
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,615
Scott: You could even argue that like a gong is a somehow a cymbal cousin or something.

458
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:10,337
Scott: Well, yeah fucking know.

459
00:31:10,377 --> 00:31:14,519
Rym: Well gongs, uh, Gongs are actually hard to play.

460
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:18,760
Scott: Regardless if you've ever it now that you're thinking about cymbals more than you have in the past 10 years.

461
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:20,626
Rym: You've ever thought about cymbals, right?

462
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:22,733
Scott: You might think common sense.

463
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:27,215
Scott: every cymbal you've ever seen almost Almost every cymbal you ever seen says Zildjian on it.

464
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:31,493
Scott: Yep, right It's super rare to see a cymbal that does not say Zildjian on it.

465
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:33,199
Rym: It's saving it otherwise, right?

466
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,100
Scott: It's like there's one other company that make like that.

467
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,060
Scott: You may have seen maybe and it maybe looked like a knockoff cymbal.

468
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:42,175
Scott: Maybe people who really do know about drums are like wait a minute.

469
00:31:42,195 --> 00:31:42,637
Scott: There's more.

470
00:31:42,718 --> 00:31:46,250
Scott: I know them Yeah, but 90% of the cymbals you've seen say Zildjian on them.

471
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:51,480
Rym: I've seen three kinds the two we just talked about or unlabeled garbage cymbals.

472
00:31:51,621 --> 00:32:05,570
Scott: So my thing of the day is a video from the Zildjian cymbal factory that shows the 100% entire process of making a cymbal out of a lump of fucking metal all the way to a Playable cymbal with Zildjian printed on it.

473
00:32:06,032 --> 00:32:07,217
Scott: It is an incredible video.

474
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:09,063
Scott: That is amazing How they mass-produced them.

475
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:16,479
Scott: the highlight of the video is the guy whose job it is as his only job cymbal tester.

476
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:20,230
Scott: Fuck he's had the job for decades.

477
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,380
Scott: There's one dude as a fucking amazing.

478
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,717
Rym: I want to give this guy on that show of which of these two things is more expensive.

479
00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:27,512
Scott: That's the dude That's the cymbal testing dude.

480
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:32,243
Rym: Yeah, right That's the guy also That's the face of an expert.

481
00:32:32,324 --> 00:32:39,811
Scott: after you watch the cymbal testing video go and read the Wikipedia page about Zildjian cymbals the company.

482
00:32:40,254 --> 00:32:41,140
Scott: it is fascinating.

483
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,507
Scott: It is one of the oldest companies there is.

484
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:53,376
Scott: they do make an absurdly large percentage of the world's cymbal supply And the history is somewhat similar to the history of Adidas.

485
00:32:53,557 --> 00:33:01,660
Scott: your do your man Adi Dassler right who made shoes and then his brother was like and his brother went and made Puma, right?

486
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:10,653
Scott: So Zildjian is a family the Zildjian right and they chose one Person at one point among the generations of Zildjian's right?

487
00:33:10,693 --> 00:33:12,660
Scott: I guess it says who the current ones are.

488
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:20,658
Scott: There's still Zildjian still family company, but at one point in the history of you know, they're I guess You know, what's it called?

489
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:23,346
Scott: Arid What's the word for that?

490
00:33:23,506 --> 00:33:24,411
Rym: what the dynasty?

491
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:35,938
Scott: Yeah, I guess at one generation someone was chosen to take over to be the Zildjian guy and The one who wasn't chosen went and went off and made a different cymbal company, which is something else.

492
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:42,132
Rym: Yep I mean I was watching that, you know that winter garden guy who's making the crazy marble machine X Right.

493
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:49,680
Rym: He Recently like not too long ago chose the cymbals for the new machine and he he has very similar opinions.

494
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:54,516
Rym: He got a bunch of Non name-brand symbols shall we say and they were all shit.

495
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:57,530
Scott: Yeah But yeah, awesome to see how.

496
00:33:57,551 --> 00:34:02,334
Scott: I remember on Sesame Street back in the day There was like a video they would always show of like a saxophone being made.

497
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:03,420
Rym: I remember that one.

498
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,669
Rym: I remember I have like kid memories of that one, right?

499
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:08,540
Scott: And it was fascinating seeing you like get bent right and like.

500
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:10,418
Scott: It was really fun.

501
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,195
Scott: Yeah But this is this is equally good and they don't hide nothing.

502
00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:15,120
Scott: like you watch this video.

503
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:18,980
Scott: If you have enough money, you could probably copy that factory from this video.

504
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:20,465
Scott: They're not hiding nothing.

505
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:23,717
Scott: They're so confident that you cannot beat them at the same game.

506
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:31,120
Rym: They're like, yeah here We'll show you everything like a night like watching I don't know a super like watching it one of the best hockey players on earth play.

507
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,245
Rym: It's not like they have to hide their technique So someone doesn't steal right.

508
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:37,900
Scott: one of the most fun parts of the video also is you know, they're making the symbol.

509
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,900
Scott: They're flattening out this big piece of metal me a perfect circle putting a lump in the middle poking the hole in it.

510
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,844
Rym: All this real important.

511
00:34:43,884 --> 00:34:49,139
Scott: Yeah all this stuff right and then it's at the whole time It looks like it's all filthy and disgusting.

512
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,916
Scott: It's like when are they gonna polish it and then only like very close to the end do they?

513
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:54,960
Scott: they don't polish it.

514
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:58,533
Scott: They throw it on the lathe and the dude lathes it by hand.

515
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:00,580
Scott: How many symbols is a dude lathe?

516
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,306
Scott: That's dangerous as fuck.

517
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:02,889
Scott: Holy shit.

518
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,975
Scott: He does it really fast.

519
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,000
Scott: Yeah, watch this video.

520
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:10,385
Rym: I mean one of the comments on the YouTube video is part two is held in symbols retail $400 to $900 each.

521
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:19,269
Rym: part three my friends not believing me when I tell them that my kit is worth $10,000 and It's only $1,000 if I didn't own symbol right.

522
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:27,372
Scott: you look at like a few hundred dollars per symbol and in this video there's like Thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars just float and on buys.

523
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:29,460
Scott: because like symbol symbol symbol symbol symbol.

524
00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:31,771
Scott: But I guess each one was laid by hand.

525
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:33,660
Scott: That's what you're paying for and tested by hand.

526
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,005
Scott: Yeah, that's what you're paying for.

527
00:35:35,025 --> 00:35:39,320
Rym: cuz a cheap symbol sounds bad like garbage like you have to Mike.

528
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:48,433
Scott: You're better off you don't take a piece of metal right and hit it and take a hammer Right and maybe a forge and try to make it sound like any fucking thing.

529
00:35:48,473 --> 00:35:50,459
Scott: try to even make like a cast a net.

530
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,323
Scott: good Fucking luck.

531
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:59,116
Rym: if you want to make if you can't afford to make a tambourine If you can't afford a real sound even a whole tambourine just one part of the tambourine you're better off.

532
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:00,099
Rym: Just using a drum machine.

533
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,099
Scott: Yeah, you know what's in the drum machine recording is of Zildjian symbols.

534
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:09,934
Rym: yep In the moment the GeekNights book club book is the tale of Genji.

535
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:11,459
Scott: I actually started reading tale of Genji.

536
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,024
Scott: all right I really are reading.

537
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:16,960
Scott: I read the introduction and I'm in the beginning of the first chapter of a very long book.

538
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,178
Scott: So it's still gonna be a while.

539
00:36:18,862 --> 00:36:21,876
Rym: I gotta fly to Seattle soon, and then I gotta fly to London by way of.

540
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,639
Scott: you will read Maybe the introduction and a few chapters.

541
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:34,680
Scott: Yeah I will read the introduction because usually that gives us a lot of introduction gives a lot of info whenever you're reading these Translated slash old books like when you read the Odyssey.

542
00:36:34,761 --> 00:36:43,758
Scott: so here again is another translated old book and Therefore you need to read the introduction to get all the historical meta info and translation meta info from the translator.

543
00:36:43,898 --> 00:36:47,710
Rym: real soon We'll be at PAX West 2019 the true packs.

547
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:04,612
Rym: each probably at least yep Cuz packs has some nonsense metal detectors.

548
00:37:04,673 --> 00:37:11,335
Rym: now, I feel like At this point magfest is the only con we go to that doesn't have like ridiculous fake security.

549
00:37:11,515 --> 00:37:11,696
Scott: Yep.

550
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,566
Rym: It's the only one yep Alright, let's get into it.

Scott: I went and I looked on crunchyroll.

556
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:24,748
Scott: I looked at what we judged.

557
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:25,332
Scott: dr.

558
00:37:25,372 --> 00:37:26,600
Scott: Stone was near the top.

559
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:28,023
Scott: Let's watch that.

560
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:30,573
Scott: it sounded like the premise had possibilities.

561
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,260
Scott: everyone earth gets turned to stone.

562
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:32,883
Scott: That's all I knew.

563
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:35,676
Scott: so I watched enough episode.

564
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:36,560
Scott: I watched a set of it.

565
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:56,799
Scott: I watched three episodes, and I said all right how I usually we watch four But I kind of want to learn exactly this much stuff before I talk about it, and I learned exactly that much stuff I think in episode six, and I think seven episodes were out, but I decided not to watch anymore ever And I'll just read spoilers when the show is done.

566
00:37:57,641 --> 00:37:59,347
Rym: Sim that's my my similar.

567
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:01,114
Rym: That's how I handled attack on Titan.

568
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,600
Rym: after the first two seasons.

569
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:04,105
Rym: I was like you know what.

570
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:07,380
Rym: I'm gonna read the spoilers to find out what the secret of space is.

571
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:09,129
Rym: I know the secret of space.

572
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:11,159
Rym: do not watch any more of that show.

573
00:38:12,442 --> 00:38:14,637
Rym: I don't know if you even want to know what the secret of space is.

574
00:38:14,657 --> 00:38:17,399
Rym: yeah But I do want to know what the secret of space is in dr.

575
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:17,942
Rym: Stone.

576
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:18,706
Scott: so here's the deal.

577
00:38:18,787 --> 00:38:22,703
Scott: there's a high school kid is in typical Japan high school.

578
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:23,245
Scott: yeah, he.

579
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:24,368
Scott: obviously all that.

580
00:38:24,488 --> 00:38:28,520
Scott: most of the other people in the high school are non characters because they don't look cool.

581
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:29,765
Scott: Yeah, he looks cool.

582
00:38:29,905 --> 00:38:30,447
Scott: It's weird though.

583
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:44,640
Rym: They character design of these two main characters are like a cross between Yugioh and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, they're pretty extreme characters like crazy hair Dumb guy the real main guy who isn't the doctor yeah?

584
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,546
Scott: He is the only guy's not a doctor either.

585
00:38:46,606 --> 00:38:48,334
Scott: the stone is the doctor.

586
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:49,479
Rym: the soap is the doctor.

587
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:50,546
Scott: well There's another doctor.

588
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:52,300
Scott: the stone itself is that anyway yeah?

589
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,324
Rym: But there's.

590
00:38:54,048 --> 00:39:01,657
Rym: it's weird because they when I saw his face And he looked weird and I realized that he is a weird amalgamation of the

591
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:02,640
Scott: most generic

592
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:05,140
Rym: possible anime high school protagonist

593
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,409
Scott: crossed

594
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:14,118
Rym: with Basically the golden boy face kinda like he makes the golden boy face a lot like to the point that

595
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:16,471
Scott: I think it's based on The art style of the manga creator.

596
00:39:16,551 --> 00:39:21,302
Rym: yep as soon as he frowned I was like it's just a golden boy holy crap Yeah Golden boy.

597
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:25,515
Scott: and then you they briefly introduce cuz he stops in the science lab for like two seconds.

598
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:29,540
Scott: this clearly other main character Who is like science guy who's a genius yep?

599
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:34,380
Scott: And then they introduce the girl the main guy is into is obviously also a main character.

600
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:36,455
Scott: So and then you do this in about a minute.

601
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:37,200
Rym: Yes, here's the thing.

602
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:38,069
Rym: I'll break in here.

603
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:42,796
Rym: as we described this shot This was the first make-or-break moment for what I was gonna say about the show cuz.

604
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:48,437
Rym: my worry was There's like five episodes of build-up to all the crap and introduce all the people.

605
00:39:48,517 --> 00:39:49,320
Scott: nope one minute.

606
00:39:49,743 --> 00:39:57,800
Scott: And then as soon as he's gonna confess his love to this girl Outside by the tree the girl you just saw for the first time who he's been talking about for the past.

607
00:39:58,221 --> 00:40:04,197
Scott: Maybe minute the whole entire earth everyone every human being on earth some mysterious green wave.

608
00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:05,380
Scott: it comes and turns everyone to stone.

609
00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:08,510
Rym: Yep, but in the co-stars, but then it's just him.

610
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,915
Rym: he's still conscious, and he's just like I can't pass out What if I die and for?

611
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:19,392
Rym: 3,700 years he's just laying there just trying to stay conscious.

612
00:40:19,473 --> 00:40:23,040
Scott: right he really really really wants to somehow stay conscious.

613
00:40:23,602 --> 00:40:25,467
Scott: Get out of this rock that he's been.

614
00:40:25,768 --> 00:40:28,335
Scott: the people clearly have not been turned to stone.

615
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:40,136
Scott: like Medusa turns people to stone He there he's like alive inside a stone shell which is already Terrifying now because it also makes no sense because that would be worse than solitary confinement.

616
00:40:40,156 --> 00:40:41,059
Scott: you would just go insane.

617
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:47,780
Rym: very In a real world the this doctor kid probably would have woken up fine, and everyone else would have woken up insane.

618
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:48,742
Scott: Dr..

619
00:40:48,783 --> 00:40:52,140
Rym: Kid would also know because the doctor kid with his second counting.

620
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:58,928
Rym: Not that any of you listening to Wednesday GeekNights have read the prince of nothing But that's some kellis shit right there kind of.

621
00:40:58,968 --> 00:40:59,690
Scott: but I still don't do.

622
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,836
Scott: anyway the point is very unrealistic.

623
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:07,595
Scott: It's an anime so the one guy concentrates on the girl that he wants to confess to.

624
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:10,587
Rym: the other guy just For four or five thousand years.

625
00:41:10,607 --> 00:41:22,959
Scott: the other guy literally counts every single second while Simultaneously having thoughts in the other half of his brain see us about the situation whatever and he's science guy.

626
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:29,120
Scott: and Basically yeah, they wake up thousands of years later, and no one else is awake.

627
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:44,853
Rym: So my second point when they wait now you've got brains guy and bronze guy Teaming up to rebuild civilization from scratch, and I'll point out up to this point not only is it moving fast And but it's also pretty funny like right away.

628
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:46,257
Rym: The science guy is like hey.

629
00:41:46,277 --> 00:41:47,340
Rym: I made you a love potion.

630
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,735
Rym: I'm the science guy And he's like I would never use such a thing.

631
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:51,339
Rym: and he pours it out.

632
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,728
Rym: And then the kids like good thing he poured it out.

633
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:55,113
Rym: That was just fucking gasoline.

634
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:57,000
Rym: Yeah, I didn't make a love potion.

635
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,914
Scott: He's like I was like I was 100% sure he wouldn't take it.

636
00:42:00,054 --> 00:42:00,979
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

637
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:02,284
Scott: anyway He does that a lot.

638
00:42:02,304 --> 00:42:08,190
Scott: where he does the I'm X percent sure yep, and it's actually pretty like he's a pretty funny character Like it's a little bit of c-3po.

639
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:26,811
Scott: It is so yeah, so this anime I see it as a combination of aspects of other animes, so the the comedy Aspect right that's sort of the wackiness there that you see right really reminds me of you know Not of like a chromardie, which is sort of like the.

640
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,256
Scott: you know it's.

641
00:42:28,457 --> 00:42:29,119
Scott: it's just like.

642
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:31,708
Scott: You know it's just sort of like these the.

643
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:37,149
Scott: you know the extreme not as D Art wise like extreme reactions like.

644
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,759
Scott: you know someone says something and someone's like holy shit.

645
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:46,914
Rym: It's like the shonen equivalent of like the SD stuff that happens in like for she writing all the characters.

646
00:42:46,955 --> 00:42:51,587
Scott: reactions to things like are Extreme and like when they're emotional.

647
00:42:51,647 --> 00:42:56,935
Scott: It's like you know they cry and like a river of tears come out right you know That kind of thing.

648
00:42:56,996 --> 00:42:58,607
Rym: yep This was the next point.

649
00:42:58,647 --> 00:42:59,190
Rym: now they don't.

650
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:03,575
Scott: then the set the other anime I think is a combination of right isn't?

651
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:05,565
Scott: it's not even anime it's still a manga is?

652
00:43:05,645 --> 00:43:13,790
Scott: it has the sort of storytelling structure of Delicious in dungeon where it's like you're there.

653
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,016
Scott: You know this is this this plot.

654
00:43:16,056 --> 00:43:18,886
Scott: That's happening right You know?

655
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,600
Scott: oh the world has turned to stone.

656
00:43:20,721 --> 00:43:21,285
Scott: What do we do?

657
00:43:21,386 --> 00:43:23,140
Scott: or trying to accomplish this or trying right?

658
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:30,643
Scott: But they pause and explain science things the same way that delicious in dungeon pauses and Explains.

659
00:43:31,004 --> 00:43:34,537
Scott: you know recipes of monsters the same way that any of those.

660
00:43:34,557 --> 00:43:38,033
Scott: you know I guess Mushishi pauses and explains a mushi made-up.

661
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:39,440
Rym: nonsense of mushishi right.

662
00:43:40,142 --> 00:43:46,070
Rym: But and it's pretty accurate to the point that the show has all these warnings at the end like kids don't fucking eat mushrooms in the wild right.

663
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:51,660
Scott: The other thing it combines with I think is obviously attack on Titan.

664
00:43:52,522 --> 00:43:55,972
Scott: You know what is this the big secret of this world?

665
00:43:55,992 --> 00:44:03,460
Scott: then obviously attack on Titan isn't the first one to do it But it does it in the you know attack on Titan way like Evangelion also has.

666
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,312
Scott: What is the secret of this world, but it doesn't come across the same way?

667
00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:09,640
Scott: This is overt ham-fisted?

668
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:15,599
Rym: What is the secret of this world, but in another point one thing that I do enjoy a lot about it is that?

669
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:23,249
Rym: Like in a Western fandom people like especially fanboys really like the zombie apocalypse like okay Basically all the people are gone.

670
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:25,300
Rym: You got a small amount of people in there zombies everywhere.

671
00:44:25,822 --> 00:44:26,928
Rym: What do you do like?

672
00:44:27,028 --> 00:44:29,460
Rym: how do you survive, but in this case?

673
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,792
Rym: How do you survive like the enemy is just like the conflict?

674
00:44:33,853 --> 00:44:35,037
Rym: is science like all right?

675
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:36,711
Rym: We gotta make food We gotta make shelter.

676
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:37,861
Rym: We gotta make fire We gotta make.

677
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:41,251
Scott: that is a final anime that I think this is a combination of.

678
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:47,759
Scott: is that it is a combination of also the MMO Anime, how is this a combination of MMO anime where there's no video games involved?

679
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:47,860
Scott: well?

680
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,568
Scott: I'll tell you I hit the time.

681
00:44:49,608 --> 00:44:56,311
Scott: they simply have replaced the MMO with a game like don't starve or even minecraft.

682
00:44:56,331 --> 00:45:01,445
Scott: you know any of these games the survival type games you start or You know one hour one life.

683
00:45:01,526 --> 00:45:02,188
Scott: any of these games?

684
00:45:02,228 --> 00:45:13,299
Scott: you start with nothing and you build up from the the only things that you can gather from the environment and Create full things by combining and combining and combining and combining so fast.

685
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:18,018
Rym: there It's always literally like a video game like they once they start picking mushrooms.

686
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,292
Rym: now They just have mushrooms all the time.

687
00:45:20,312 --> 00:45:30,240
Scott: We never even look at that again, right It's it has that same structure of one of those games And it comes across the same way as when an MMO is adapted to an anime.

688
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:37,224
Scott: And you know say hack sign it just is one of those different game slightly different game genre Adapted to anime.

689
00:45:37,244 --> 00:45:51,986
Scott: slash manga right and take all those all those elements right the the wacky comedy the pause aside to explain science, you know the big secret of this world and the survival game and Put them all together.

690
00:45:52,107 --> 00:45:52,971
Scott: and that is dr.

691
00:45:52,991 --> 00:45:53,193
Scott: Stone.

692
00:45:53,454 --> 00:46:00,520
Rym: It's got a two-sauce of Fist of the North Star In the sense that it's our some action scenes.

693
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:11,295
Rym: It's a post-apocalyptic world, but the action scenes when when humans conflict with each other Which I was wondering if that would even happen I was wondering if the show was literally just gonna be we science for 24 episodes?

694
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:15,270
Scott: no But you know it does move quickly to its credit.

695
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:20,749
Scott: so like they wake up another person like almost right away Yeah, they do not hesitate and also the girl right.

696
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:23,359
Scott: so the statue of the girl the guy finds it right away.

697
00:46:25,402 --> 00:46:30,177
Rym: If the statue of the girl had been a statue for more than like five or seven you assume that like.

698
00:46:30,258 --> 00:46:32,590
Scott: oh waking up the Girl is gonna be like the last episode.

699
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:37,660
Scott: No he wakes her up in episode three Yep, and he was gonna wake her up earlier or something like that like right away.

700
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,066
Rym: But they wake up muscle guy instead.

701
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:41,114
Scott: and to wake up muscle guy because lions come.

702
00:46:41,295 --> 00:46:42,480
Rym: so that's the fist of the North Star.

703
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,214
Rym: Because muscle guy basically immediately turns into a fist of the North Star villain.

704
00:46:47,615 --> 00:46:48,097
Scott: right well.

705
00:46:48,157 --> 00:46:49,665
Scott: He's not really a villain He's a good.

706
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:52,939
Rym: He's good, but well He's good.

707
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:58,960
Rym: He's got one bad good idea, but he's dangerous, and he's making the Society of muscle men.

708
00:46:59,261 --> 00:47:02,914
Scott: Yeah, kinda like right away like I'm stronger than all of you, and he's like.

709
00:47:02,934 --> 00:47:03,757
Scott: he's like row.

710
00:47:03,998 --> 00:47:05,447
Scott: he's bad But he's not yeah.

711
00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:07,340
Rym: He's I said fist of the North Star villain.

712
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:07,703
Rym: He's not.

713
00:47:07,723 --> 00:47:09,818
Scott: that's why I thought of round, but there are other villains like that.

714
00:47:09,899 --> 00:47:10,561
Rym: yeah But there are.

715
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:14,571
Rym: he's not one of those like Skeletory fist of the North Star villains more.

716
00:47:14,972 --> 00:47:20,265
Rym: He's a conflicted villain right but This is where the show gets a little.

717
00:47:20,526 --> 00:47:27,689
Rym: he fucking punches a lion to death and then turns its skin into a outfit like Instantly like he can just fight lions.

718
00:47:27,729 --> 00:47:29,859
Scott: Yeah, it's is immune crossbows.

719
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,062
Scott: This guy is all sciency right the science guy And he tries to.

720
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,415
Scott: he's trying to figure out the mystery of you know why everyone turned to stone?

721
00:47:36,455 --> 00:47:37,860
Scott: which and how come only people?

722
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:39,224
Scott: Sparrows turned to stone?

723
00:47:39,284 --> 00:47:41,190
Scott: yeah, right, and it you know it's like okay.

724
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:42,655
Scott: You know see everything's cool here.

725
00:47:42,715 --> 00:47:44,300
Scott: Everything's really legit science.

726
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,503
Scott: There's no bullshit going on.

727
00:47:45,544 --> 00:47:46,386
Rym: is nitric acid?

728
00:47:46,426 --> 00:47:47,549
Rym: wake people up right?

729
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:48,572
Scott: it Bob Emily's.

730
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:50,899
Scott: at least it's real science for the acid you know.

731
00:47:52,084 --> 00:48:03,316
Scott: But the thing is it's like he doesn't question his own Superpowers the superpowers of his best friend the superpower of the guy they wake up or the apparent lack of superpower so far That's obvious of the girl.

732
00:48:03,336 --> 00:48:09,039
Rym: now That's what I don't know I did because like in a show like you're trying Are this a little bit of Lord of the Flies here right?

733
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:24,815
Scott: We're each person trying to survive and each person is a specialty, but they're all super powered in that specialty beyond all reality Except the girl who buy has a secret superpower, and they're not questioning these superpowers And it seems they did have the superpowers pre everyone turning the stone.

734
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:27,991
Scott: yeah, right It's like whoa, so that's what I wonder.

735
00:48:28,011 --> 00:48:36,522
Rym: because in shows like utenna The weird super power crap that happens that you might just write off as anime crap Plot.

736
00:48:36,783 --> 00:48:40,055
Rym: it is explained specifically, but then in some other anime.

737
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:43,746
Scott: It's also the plot in one punch, man Yeah, but then exactly why?

738
00:48:43,827 --> 00:48:44,529
Rym: what is one punch?

739
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:52,013
Rym: man's deal that anyway, but in other anime Yeah, this person just randomly has powers because it's an anime.

740
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:52,395
Rym: That's it.

741
00:48:52,415 --> 00:48:53,700
Rym: There's no explanation.

742
00:48:53,881 --> 00:48:55,067
Scott: That's the only thing that's like.

743
00:48:55,107 --> 00:48:57,279
Scott: not they didn't even try to explain in any way.

744
00:48:57,721 --> 00:49:00,823
Rym: My based on the like six a few episodes I saw.

745
00:49:00,903 --> 00:49:02,977
Rym: cuz not even there aren't even that many episodes out.

746
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:07,451
Rym: yet There are gonna be 24 episodes total a grand total of seven.

747
00:49:07,592 --> 00:49:10,600
Scott: is that gonna cover the whole thing which I assume is the manga.

748
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,829
Rym: Doubtful because the manga is 13 volumes.

749
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,433
Rym: it started in 2017.

750
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:16,596
Rym: It's already got 13 volumes.

751
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:17,499
Rym: It's ongoing.

752
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:22,815
Rym: okay So the manga is still going and there are 13 volumes of it.

753
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:24,039
Scott: alright, but yeah.

754
00:49:25,301 --> 00:49:27,709
Scott: So that's that explains what the show is.

755
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,040
Scott: the thing is I don't think I really want to watch more of this show.

756
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,386
Scott: Interesting because it's so.

757
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:35,000
Scott: the characters are so two-dimensional.

758
00:49:35,161 --> 00:49:37,950
Scott: They may be the most two-dimensional characters have ever seen.

759
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:44,751
Rym: I was almost inclined to keep watching just because Despite that it was moving so fast.

760
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:47,559
Scott: the plot moves at a very rapid pace.

761
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:50,437
Rym: like I said They're already like trying to make gunpowder.

762
00:49:50,598 --> 00:49:58,871
Rym: Yep It's like they move it right fucking along in the same time waiting Despite how fast is moving based on the opener alone.

763
00:49:59,293 --> 00:50:01,139
Rym: They're a shit ton of characters.

764
00:50:01,662 --> 00:50:02,487
Scott: Well, I mean you didn't.

765
00:50:02,607 --> 00:50:07,900
Scott: if you watch two more episodes like I did yeah You'd have seen they meet someone who is not awoken by them.

766
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:14,878
Scott: There are other people who have already been awake When basically when they set off the gunpowder it makes smoke and then they'll see a smoke signal in the distance.

767
00:50:14,918 --> 00:50:15,360
Scott: and like what?

768
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,209
Scott: Other people oh my god.

769
00:50:17,532 --> 00:50:38,820
Rym: so on one end I'm very happy to see a lot of the things you could normally get out of it like fantasy world isekai or out of a like Zombie apocalypse type thing, but instead it's more like kind of real kind of real science-based like it's a very different like Setting for this kind of story.

770
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:43,419
Rym: Yeah, but but it's still in the end a shonen show.

771
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:45,266
Scott: yes The two-dimensional characters.

772
00:50:45,286 --> 00:50:50,894
Scott: to think of the number one thing that turns me off the rapid pace is good because you're not Sit around doing nothing.

773
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:58,962
Scott: Yeah But just like stop by your rap you're rapidly plowing through a really flimsy kind of meh plot You're not?

774
00:50:58,982 --> 00:51:03,155
Scott: you're not rapidly plowing through a deep meaty plot that gives not to think about.

775
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:09,503
Rym: it's not like escaflowne Which is just like every episode is a two-hour movie 23 minutes.

776
00:51:09,563 --> 00:51:17,728
Scott: the thing is that I think stands out most about this show is it definitely feels like somebody created this for Japanese children, which is all.

777
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:26,246
Scott: anime is great for Japanese children almost all of it right, but And there's so much stuff that Blatantly reeks of.

778
00:51:26,607 --> 00:51:30,760
Scott: we are trying this show is trying to teach Japanese children how to be right.

779
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:36,380
Scott: It's like you know oh that guy who is you know only wants to get rid of the old people.

780
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:37,523
Scott: He's bad looks.

781
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:39,489
Scott: you can solve anything with science.

782
00:51:39,549 --> 00:51:40,431
Scott: science is good.

783
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:41,715
Scott: Oh, you know.

784
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,480
Scott: I'm not amazed with your science.

785
00:51:43,561 --> 00:51:46,344
Scott: I'm amazed with your hard work And how you know you didn't?

786
00:51:46,525 --> 00:51:50,497
Scott: you just patiently kept working until you you know got the job done.

787
00:51:50,537 --> 00:51:54,158
Scott: you see took you hours but you see a lion to death with your own hands.

788
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:54,259
Rym: and

789
00:51:55,762 --> 00:52:06,020
Scott: It's like the show reeks of like Pausing constantly, and they say things that really sound like things that like would be after like the more you know star

790
00:52:06,982 --> 00:52:07,545
Rym: To their

791
00:52:07,646 --> 00:52:08,128
Scott: credit

792
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:13,872
Rym: in a lot of shows that teach stuff They tend to like like my Ashima had this problem a little bit.

793
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:19,366
Rym: They spend a lot of time talking about Very little when they actually explain stuff.

794
00:52:19,406 --> 00:52:26,785
Rym: in this show they explain pretty accurate things very quickly, and then they move on like hey Here's the chemical.

795
00:52:26,825 --> 00:52:28,656
Rym: Here's what it does 30 seconds later.

796
00:52:28,696 --> 00:52:29,420
Rym: They're fighting a lot.

797
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,240
Scott: Did you know you can use seashells for yeah?

798
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,632
Scott: You can make sodium bicarbonate, and you can use that for this.

799
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,979
Scott: you can use it for that and you can you.

800
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:35,220
Scott: it's like.

801
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:40,599
Rym: I'm curious where they're really gonna go in the long run with gunpowder though because gunpowder is not hard to make.

802
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:42,674
Rym: you know It's hard to make a cannon.

803
00:52:42,956 --> 00:52:50,519
Rym: Yeah Explosives are way easier to make than things to harness explosions, right well the show is called dr.

804
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,417
Scott: Stone and the first time they mentioned dr.

805
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,740
Rym: Stone when he makes soap, and he's like this is the only thing that will keep us alive.

806
00:52:58,401 --> 00:53:00,952
Scott: He's like without society we have no medicine if we get sick.

807
00:53:00,972 --> 00:53:01,554
Scott: We're fucked.

808
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:07,057
Rym: this so is our doctor Dr.. Stone, but I love it when shows say the name of the show.

809
00:53:07,158 --> 00:53:15,540
Scott: in the show They say the name of the show again because as it turns out right When they're covered in stuff you'll notice all the characters of these cracks on their faces.

810
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:22,294
Scott: Yeah, that's because first you think it's just character design But no it's because the stone was cracked when they were turned to stone.

811
00:53:22,314 --> 00:53:31,218
Scott: and apparently when you get unstoned that Unstoning like heals you in that part that you got unstoned in.

812
00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:34,140
Rym: so wait They're gonna restone someone at some point.

813
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,267
Scott: I don't know maybe but there's actually the girl.

814
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:47,656
Scott: they unstoned her and like her foot is still stoned and then they unstoned the foot And then like like her foot is like healed Like somehow when I get hurt and then when they and then it got healed by the unstoning.

815
00:53:47,917 --> 00:53:52,860
Scott: so and they're like Maybe this stone that everyone turned into is the doctor stone.

816
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:57,220
Scott: Maybe what turned the world to stone wasn't malevolent, but was benevolent.

817
00:53:57,621 --> 00:54:00,833
Rym: So these are my working theories having seen a little bit of this show.

818
00:54:00,873 --> 00:54:06,512
Scott: so they already have two meanings for dr Stone if you maybe count the third one and that the science guy.

819
00:54:06,793 --> 00:54:08,137
Scott: he's not a doctor, but it's like.

820
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:10,345
Scott: you know It's the stone age.

821
00:54:10,405 --> 00:54:11,449
Scott: Maybe you could call him.

822
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:14,160
Scott: You know because he's a smart science guy doctor stone.

823
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,780
Rym: Maybe kind of see the stone doctor doctor stone anyway.

824
00:54:18,382 --> 00:54:22,135
Rym: So my idea number one is this is a wind of amnesia situation.

825
00:54:22,195 --> 00:54:26,664
Rym: if any of you watch old anime Aliens did this to see if well It's actually.

826
00:54:26,704 --> 00:54:29,420
Scott: I don't know if you saw the scene where the science guy is thinking.

827
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,664
Scott: What are the possibilities?

828
00:54:30,704 --> 00:54:31,727
Scott: number one aliens.

829
00:54:31,988 --> 00:54:34,074
Scott: number two evil mad scientist.

830
00:54:34,655 --> 00:54:36,260
Scott: number three like foreign government?

831
00:54:36,521 --> 00:54:38,840
Scott: Yeah before some sort of in environmental.

832
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,843
Scott: He's like going through the list of all the things that you would think of could be an oryx and Craig Situation.

833
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:43,043
Scott: he's like.

834
00:54:43,063 --> 00:54:43,325
Scott: he's like.

835
00:54:43,345 --> 00:54:51,913
Scott: he's like could been a virus that did this to that to the humans and only if in the virus Only affected swallows in human or better Explain the light right, but it's like he's trying to.

836
00:54:51,953 --> 00:54:55,900
Scott: he comes up with all the explanations It's that you're thinking of too, and he runs down them all.

837
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:57,990
Scott: Yeah, he doesn't settle on.

838
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:58,513
Scott: he doesn't know yet.

839
00:54:58,534 --> 00:54:59,420
Scott: He's still trying to figure it out.

840
00:54:59,481 --> 00:55:06,116
Rym: But my real thinking is either It's a wind of amnesia situation of aliens like testing to see if humans are worthy to the world.

841
00:55:06,497 --> 00:55:12,160
Rym: our actual world is Actually a fantasy world from a long time ago, and this is the world resetting in some way.

842
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:15,677
Rym: Mm-hmm like I could see that like some weird thing happening with that.

843
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:18,005
Scott: But everything is not.

844
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:19,149
Scott: everything is science though.

845
00:55:19,209 --> 00:55:22,040
Scott: yep true there is no is not a fantasy world.

846
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,705
Scott: This is a science world.

847
00:55:23,805 --> 00:55:33,215
Rym: I could see benevolent aliens doing this to protect us from some cosmic event that was going to kill us Like radiation storms coming through and the aliens like do this to save us.

848
00:55:33,335 --> 00:55:34,379
Scott: That's the only thing they could think of.

849
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:48,700
Scott: yeah Anyway, so if you're the kind of anime fan who likes you know like the most popular You know shonen type animes, then you're probably gonna like this type of show.

850
00:55:49,101 --> 00:55:51,287
Rym: I like this way more than any other shonen show.

851
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:57,131
Scott: yeah, I guess it's better than like a Naruto or something that goes into a Tournament and drags on.

852
00:55:57,151 --> 00:55:58,520
Scott: yeah, but it's still you know.

853
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:04,669
Scott: But it's it's better than an attack on Titan because it seems like it might actually be going somewhere But I don't.

854
00:56:04,831 --> 00:56:08,286
Rym: it's going like both Shallow as all fuck.

855
00:56:08,607 --> 00:56:14,590
Rym: bokurano was another show that was a. bokurano was legit though Yeah, but it was characters in a predicament.

856
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:18,461
Rym: those characters were not two-dimensional true They were not two-dimensional but it was still.

857
00:56:18,502 --> 00:56:27,908
Rym: it was characters in a like very contrived freaking predicament who intelligently worked to solve the problem and Bokerano was going somewhere.

858
00:56:27,948 --> 00:56:35,278
Scott: that would make you cry a lot right by those Characters all had their own deep backstories with things they had to deal with.

859
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:35,680
Rym: this shows.

860
00:56:37,484 --> 00:56:39,473
Scott: You are science guy you are girl.

861
00:56:39,554 --> 00:56:40,659
Scott: you are you know?

862
00:56:42,141 --> 00:56:43,460
Scott: Brawny guy you are.

863
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:48,073
Rym: Your fighting guy is literally 40 seconds on screen of.

864
00:56:48,093 --> 00:56:50,280
Rym: a long time ago an adult hit me.

865
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,195
Scott: no No, there actually is a whole like half an episode that shows his backstory, so it's more than that It's litter.

866
00:56:55,216 --> 00:56:56,103
Scott: no It's literally just.

867
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,210
Scott: dad bought him a bunch of science stuff and he always science.

868
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,775
Scott: do you want to go to space?

869
00:56:59,835 --> 00:57:01,180
Rym: because fighting guy?

870
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,945
Rym: His backstory is literally.

871
00:57:03,106 --> 00:57:06,260
Rym: one time an adult hit me when I was a kid, so I'm going to murder all the adults.

872
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:11,118
Scott: Yes, but that is it is the mug I said is the most maybe even one-dimensional characters.

873
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:12,882
Scott: Yeah, right They don't have it there Just literally.

874
00:57:12,942 --> 00:57:15,770
Scott: science guy brawny guy fighting guy girl.

875
00:57:16,091 --> 00:57:18,818
Rym: yep at one point that might even just be zero-dimensional.

876
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:19,480
Rym: There's no dimension.

877
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:27,005
Scott: It's just also You know super sexist that obviously I don't even need to be mentioned that it's super sexist that the girl Is.

878
00:57:27,466 --> 00:57:31,520
Rym: if the girl characters superpower and she only nurturing healing yeah?

879
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:35,759
Scott: She only exists as love interest and thing to be protected defended etc.

880
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,372
Rym: Though in the opener there are a lot of other motivation for men.

881
00:57:39,573 --> 00:57:42,144
Rym: there are clearly a bunch of other female care They did.

882
00:57:42,164 --> 00:57:49,993
Scott: the person that they met who is not Who is not you know thousands of years old was a girl.

883
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:58,700
Rym: so if I were you though like if you're an anime fan at All just watch the first episode because move your anime fan who wants the highbrow animes stay far away.

884
00:57:58,801 --> 00:58:07,500
Scott: But if you're okay with the lowbrow popular animes Then this is the lowbrow popular anime of the season, and it's better than other similarly equally lowbrow anime.

885
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:14,539
Rym: Oh god on control views are like this also liked log horizon Majin bone taboo tattoo and bleach.

886
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:17,366
Scott: yeah So that's that's it.

887
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:19,716
Scott: I'm not gonna watch anymore because I've seen what I got to see.

888
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:20,560
Rym: I'm gonna read.

889
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,294
Scott: I'm gonna read a spoiler when I really want to know.

890
00:58:23,314 --> 00:58:24,500
