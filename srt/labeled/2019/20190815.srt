Scott: Let's do this All right, so my company right.

6
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,640
Scott: when I for uh, when I first got there like over a year ago Yeah, they were in this office.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:39,512
Scott: It was like, you know above a place where a store would usually go right but if you know pretty big But it was filling rapidly because they keep hiring people like crazy.

8
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,618
Scott: Ah, so they got a space.

9
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:47,460
Scott: that's not we It's not like a we work but it's basically like similar ish you rent a space from another place.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,739
Scott: That's rent ads actually renting the space and they put someone on the other team in there.

11
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:56,113
Scott: But then a new manager came in and they did some stuff.

12
00:00:56,153 --> 00:01:04,120
Scott: So now my team has been in there all year, basically And the company was like, yeah, this is a problem and they've been working on getting a new space.

13
00:01:04,602 --> 00:01:06,900
Scott: So at the end of the month, we're gonna move to a new space.

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,220
Scott: Basically, they're moving while I'm at pecs and when I come back from pecs, I'll go to this new office.

15
00:01:11,365 --> 00:01:13,149
Rym: Yep I'm not way back my old company.

16
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,300
Rym: we moved to the fashion district And we went to a nice building from the kind of crappy building we used to have downtown.

17
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,191
Scott: So they got like two whole floors at the top of this building.

18
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,760
Scott: It's you know, so there's a few issues, right?

19
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:25,146
Scott: So good.

20
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:26,352
Scott: I mean going to the new building.

21
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:28,000
Scott: good in general, right?

22
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:30,647
Scott: Slightly bad news.

23
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:42,508
Scott: when I moved to where I live now to over 10 years ago because I was working in an office and right outside the office was the yellow train and I said Well better get an apartment near yellow train.

24
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,907
Rym: so I can just go straight to our funny similar thing when I moved here Like not too long after you moved here.

25
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:51,740
Rym: I worked at next to Grand Central right on the purple train.

26
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:58,417
Rym: Yeah So I Moved to an apartment that was also on the purple train and then I changed jobs that work way downtown.

27
00:01:58,438 --> 00:01:59,481
Rym: take the fucking yellow Train.

28
00:01:59,622 --> 00:01:59,863
Rym: Yes.

29
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:03,459
Rym: Anyway, but now I work back next in the exact same place with the purple train again.

30
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,986
Scott: So then cut place.

31
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:10,800
Scott: I work now also yellow train and the temporary place they put us in this year also yellow train.

32
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:14,317
Scott: But now the new office are going to blue train.

33
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,286
Rym: You're taking the E to work.

34
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:18,009
Scott: Well, I get.

35
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:18,993
Scott: maybe I don't know I could.

36
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:20,038
Scott: we got to figure it out.

37
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,840
Scott: It's not great I could just keep taking the yellow train and then just walk a bunch once I get there.

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,395
Scott: So, you know what sucks the E for biking is no issue.

39
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:29,820
Scott: right by bike to work No problem, but in the winter or if it's raining, right?

40
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:37,768
Rym: So issue number two I asked about the E would be really good for me to get to work if I like because living here the E is right There anyway from the seven.

41
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:45,060
Scott: next issue is asked about biking to work and they said yeah Apparently this loading dock at this new office building has bike racks that are first come first serve.

42
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:47,149
Scott: Oh, so I got to go check it out to see.

43
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:49,420
Scott: how early do I have to get there?

44
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:51,651
Rym: Seven and it's already full.

45
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:52,575
Rym: that's not gonna work.

46
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:53,520
Scott: No, it's not gonna work.

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,359
Scott: So I got to check that out, but it's promising at least right?

48
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:05,113
Scott: So issue number three when I got there and to the way, you know in the previous office right the one that's too full Yeah, they had real shitty chairs.

49
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:07,856
Rym: Oh That's a deal breaker, right?

50
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,189
Scott: So What I did is I found I got lucky.

51
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,320
Scott: someone in near my near where I live Was moving to California and sold me a legit Aeron chair.

52
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:20,471
Rym: Oh, so you're gonna do the thing that I did it a pretty $200.

53
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,900
Rym: You're gonna bring your own chair to hold on.

54
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:24,809
Scott: They sold me this Aeron chair for $200.

55
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:26,275
Scott: I don't need it at home.

56
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,748
Scott: I got a freedom chair at home I don't know right.

57
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:35,989
Scott: So I dragged that fucking chair all the way on the subway all the way to that office and then when they moved us to The temporary office this year.

58
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,620
Scott: Yeah, I dragged my chair.

59
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:39,659
Scott: There's also shitty chairs, right?

60
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,589
Scott: So they told us, you know, we're doing.

61
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,840
Scott: they're doing like a companies, you know companies move.

62
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:53,960
Scott: They always do a thing where they put a box on your desk you fill the box You can't put more stuff in the box than fits right and then they bring it to the new office.

63
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,851
Rym: I've done this three times in my current job.

64
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:58,096
Rym: Just moving between it's always.

65
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:59,020
Scott: it's always the same.

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,460
Scott: I've been doing this to just move between floors of the same building Yeah, and you show up at your new desk on the new day and all your stuff is there.

67
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,354
Scott: Yeah, and that's how it works when you're a company that moves, right?

68
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:12,860
Scott: But I'm like, hey How do I get my chair to get moved to this new place?

69
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:15,954
Scott: So I'm like, do I just put a sticker on it.

70
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:17,339
Scott: cuz I already put a sticker on the bottom.

71
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,047
Rym: This is probably gonna move your chair.

72
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,790
Rym: So

73
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:38,110
Scott: I I'm like, I really don't want to drag it Right, and so I asked and they said him they said yeah in the new office we got these really great chairs and if you don't have a medical reason bring your chair home, and I'm like I don't care what chair you got unless it's air on chair.

74
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,440
Scott: Yeah, right if it's not air on chair freedom chair, right?

75
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,223
Scott: I'm gonna fight you.

76
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:47,661
Rym: so now like I cannot stress enough the air on chair is the second best chair there is on earth Right.

77
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:53,280
Scott: So now I have to fight I guess tomorrow to send an email just get a crooked doctor to give you a medical.

78
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:56,113
Scott: I don't want to happen but it's like I shouldn't have to do that.

79
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:59,347
Rym: Oh, yeah, Scott in the real world There's a lot of things we shouldn't have to do.

80
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:02,099
Rym: I shouldn't have to choose between two political coalitions.

81
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:11,222
Scott: before Before I go get a crooked doctor I'm gonna go to the HR person and look I'm gonna say look don't make me go to a crooked doctor cuz I Will.

82
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:13,430
Scott: that's right and just let everyone bring their gut.

83
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,180
Scott: there's people in my office, you know, we're all programmers, right?

84
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,845
Scott: Someone's got the bouncy ball.

85
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:20,855
Scott: Yeah, someone's got the weird like knee chair that rocks with.

86
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:22,802
Rym: no are we're the same way Don't you?

87
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:25,173
Rym: my engineers have the balls that they sit on.

88
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:26,620
Scott: everyone's got weird-ass chairs.

89
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,767
Scott: You're really gonna make everyone drink their fucking chairs.

90
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:33,000
Scott: Almost everyone has giant standing - it's like it's like those chairs that you got.

91
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:34,429
Scott: They might be good chairs.

92
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:38,526
Scott: I'm willing, you know, they haven't sat in them In them or seen them.

93
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,897
Scott: they could be good I don't fucking know but they're not.

94
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,506
Scott: Aaron, you know They're not my $200 air hunt chair.

95
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:44,108
Scott: That's worth 800.

96
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,796
Scott: Yeah, maybe six at the lead, right?

97
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:52,068
Scott: So I'm not sure which model it is.

98
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:54,660
Scott: It was in amazing condition, but I don't think it's the newest model.

99
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,516
Rym: Oh, yeah, cuz there's been a lot of versions, but I mean it's legit.

100
00:05:58,536 --> 00:05:59,500
Scott: Herman Miller air on chair.

101
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,546
Scott: That's a knockoff one.

102
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:00,827
Scott: Right?

103
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:03,200
Scott: So and it has all the possible adjustments.

104
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:06,941
Scott: It's not that one because that one has a different back thingy There's.

105
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:10,796
Rym: so there are a ton of - mine just has the horizontal rubbery back thingy.

106
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,285
Scott: other than that It's exactly the same as that only black.

107
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:13,807
Rym: Yep.

108
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,659
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't have the modern style back thingy where it's like vertical.

109
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,249
Rym: ish It's more trying to figure out how much they're on.

110
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,000
Scott: chair actually costs a brand new one.

111
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:25,440
Scott: It costs a lot depending on what model you bought this brand new one.

112
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,388
Rym: I still have the receipt.

113
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:32,175
Rym: brand new ones are gonna be at least Whoa, the air on chair no longer has a lifetime warranty.

114
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:32,977
Scott: That's interest 12 years.

115
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:37,580
Scott: All right, how much is a new one cost for the minimum model minimum?

116
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,781
Scott: 1275.

117
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:39,002
Rym: Yeah.

118
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:39,343
Scott: Okay.

119
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:41,691
Scott: That's not what you if you actually went to an office store.

120
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:42,654
Scott: It wouldn't cost 1275.

121
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:46,305
Rym: That's I paid 1100 I think for this one.

122
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:50,080
Scott: Yeah, I think if you buy them new at like a store, they're gonna be eight or nine hundred.

123
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:50,842
Rym: Yeah.

124
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,289
Rym: Oh if you get the basic back, it's cheaper.

125
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,051
Rym: It's 11.

126
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:55,695
Rym: It saves you like 70 bucks.

127
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:57,380
Scott: That's not a big savings now.

128
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:00,256
Rym: Yeah, anyway, you can get a leather armpad.

129
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:00,900
Rym: Why?

130
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,103
Scott: Because you're just.

131
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:03,289
Scott: you know, why?

132
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,280
Scott: why do people get leather and all kinds of stuff?

133
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:09,498
Rym: Yeah, maybe leather shoes leather jacket not a vegan errand chair anymore.

134
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:17,500
Scott: No Anyway, yeah, I'm curious about this 12-year warranty and I think the thing that I really don't understand about it right is it's like.

135
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:20,009
Scott: Okay, maybe you know, it's like.

136
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:20,270
Scott: it's like.

137
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,534
Scott: just tell me your reason right?

138
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:22,739
Scott: It's like there's a reason.

139
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:27,460
Scott: What is the reason that you don't want me to bring my own and everyone else to bring their own guy?

140
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,048
Scott: Why do you insist on me using this chair you bought?

141
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:35,899
Rym: I have learned in my life that there are exactly two possible reasons Why anything like that happens in the world?

142
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:45,774
Rym: Reason number one is the people in charge do not want to deal with anything That isn't uniform because they just don't want to have any hassle in any capacity.

143
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:46,596
Scott: No hassle for you.

144
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:47,560
Scott: Just bring up.

145
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,042
Rym: No, there's.

146
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:49,106
Rym: everyone has the same chair.

147
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,049
Rym: We control the chairs.

148
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,575
Rym: There's no exceptions to that.

149
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:57,051
Rym: So we don't have to ever think about it Making me your consequences unhappy employee.

150
00:07:57,131 --> 00:08:01,447
Scott: Yeah, you know because it's not like it's such a minor issue Why would I be so upset?

151
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:08,300
Scott: It's not the chair that I'm actually upset about It's I'm upset that the company makes a big deal about such a minor issue.

152
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:14,635
Scott: They can't just say yes Right the fact that they're gonna be such sticklers about something so minor is what makes me upset.

153
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:17,685
Scott: not actually sitting in that other chair Which would probably actually be a fine.

154
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:18,087
Scott: Just got.

155
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:24,349
Rym: if you worked in more like in more companies over your career You'll find that most places are way worse than that.

156
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,035
Scott: That's why I don't work in most places?

157
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:36,059
Rym: because reason number two is Someone made an arbitrary decision and no one who has decision-making power is willing to make a different arbitrary decision.

158
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:43,500
Rym: they want to defer to someone else and Everyone will collectively defer to the last person in power who made an arbitrary decision.

159
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:50,937
Rym: Well the last reason I make so much money is that I am very willing to make Incredibly capricious and arbitrary decisions very quickly.

160
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:52,549
Rym: well I may not be right.

161
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,969
Scott: when I got to this company They had that policy of like sick day.

162
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:01,047
Scott: if you if you're sick if you take a sick day you lose a vacation day Yeah, and then I complained and then they changed it.

163
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:09,040
Scott: so to their credit that has been different than every other place I've ever worked well, and they've also been very open right all their meeting.

164
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:11,340
Scott: You know it's like they share everything with all the employees.

165
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:13,007
Scott: They don't keep a lot of secrets.

166
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:16,120
Rym: so do you care enough to be like let me bring my chair or I quit.

167
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,366
Scott: I care enough to send an email.

168
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:20,551
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna send an email tomorrow

169
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:27,284
Rym: because long ago in a different different company I was literally like I'm going to PAX and they're like oh But you don't have enough if

170
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:29,416
Scott: they said you can't go to PAX out and I literally

171
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,079
Rym: was like well

172
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,605
Scott: I wouldn't I wouldn't quit.

173
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:32,770
Scott: I would say I'm going.

174
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,352
Scott: that's basically.

175
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:36,869
Scott: I said if you fire me all right Whatever you're gonna.

176
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,479
Scott: Do you're gonna do, but I'm going.

177
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:45,648
Scott: And I would say I'm going and if you punish me in a way that is less than firing like dock my pay Then I will quit.

178
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,799
Rym: yep Or the alternative is I will just show up until you fire me.

179
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:53,726
Rym: So in some news.

180
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:56,417
Rym: There's a bet a whole bunch of stories.

181
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:57,280
Rym: I've been seeing about this.

182
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,687
Rym: They're all kind of the same story.

183
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:01,300
Rym: there have been multiple incidents of this at different places.

184
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:01,602
Rym: I

185
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:22,309
Scott: saw a one tweet about it And the tweet was pretty much a cover of a saga issue with the relevant princey like character yeah, and then a link to this video of Someone seemingly cosplaying as you know the prince from saga with a big TV on their head yeah, putting a TV on a porch and running away

186
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:25,780
Rym: just showing up at people's houses in the middle of the night and just

187
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:26,964
Scott: Leaving

188
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:27,606
Rym: and old teeth.

189
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:30,335
Rym: now the news articles are often saying vintage TVs.

190
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:32,061
Rym: These are not vintage TVs They're just.

191
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:33,767
Scott: these are shitty TVs.

192
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:38,892
Rym: There's a very clear distinction if someone dropped off like a 50s era TV.

193
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:39,820
Rym: that would be awesome.

194
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,326
Rym: Yeah, I would take that.

195
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,900
Rym: but these are basically what these are my suspicion.

196
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,427
Rym: I have a read into what's going on here.

197
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:53,130
Rym: this person or these people have all realized that They have a bunch of old TVs, which are basically toxic waste.

198
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,840
Rym: yep old CRT's are filled with dangerous toxic shit.

199
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:58,406
Rym: It's difficult to throw them away.

200
00:10:58,446 --> 00:11:00,032
Rym: It's often expensive to throw them away.

201
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:03,607
Rym: They can't be recycled like Depends on where you live right.

202
00:11:03,627 --> 00:11:06,280
Scott: so for example in New York you could bring them to the safe disposal.

203
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:07,608
Scott: Yeah, once a year right.

204
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:12,980
Scott: and where my mom lives in Connecticut You can drive to the transfer station and put them there in a special place.

205
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:18,366
Scott: But they're generally difficult to get rid of if you have a lot of them Especially if you're like commercial.

206
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,997
Scott: like if you're a commercial business you can't go to either of those disposal places right.

207
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:27,574
Scott: also If the TVs are not good quality CRT's no one wants them.

208
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:33,580
Scott: if they are good quality Maybe some Smash Brothers players who need game cubes would want them.

209
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:37,640
Scott: But they only want them if they work really well and are good.

210
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:38,963
Scott: so it's like odds.

211
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:42,674
Scott: are most CRT's you have are broken or bad.

212
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:46,025
Scott: the very very few are good and Working.

213
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:49,147
Rym: I remember trying to get rid of that 1974 color RCA.

214
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,180
Scott: yeah a lot of arcade machines actually old arcade machines.

215
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,560
Scott: It's like the boards all still work great or can be fixed, but it's like well the CRT's busted.

216
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,626
Scott: I guess I had to.

217
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:00,477
Scott: you know I can't play Dig Dug now yep.

218
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:11,194
Rym: So I suspect that whoever is doing this very cleverly realized that if they make it look like a prank They can basically just leave their toxic waste at people's houses.

219
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,800
Scott: This is just totally get away with right?

220
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,162
Scott: It's like.

221
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:14,087
Scott: I'm not sure.

222
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:16,520
Scott: you know we don't know what the real thing is going on here.

223
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,537
Scott: But my first my immediate reaction was oh illegal dumping.

224
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:22,563
Scott: yeah It's illegal Should I?

225
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:27,077
Rym: I should dress up as a book and just start leaving all my old books on people's porches.

226
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:33,835
Scott: and like outer queens Yeah, like yeah, I mean there's a place in Brooklyn ish known as the hole which is.

227
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:38,285
Rym: we just ran a u-haul drive upstate Place to go, but it's.

228
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:47,019
Scott: it's basically this triangle of land where people kind of live that floods a lot Connected to any utilities really well and is really bad place.

229
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:50,557
Scott: Yeah, you could go dump your shit there.

230
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:55,100
Rym: So I'm pretty sure that is the full extent of what is going on here.

231
00:12:55,441 --> 00:13:03,640
Scott: But in the meantime it is also in addition to illegal dumping helping them the illegal dumpers It has also provided the world with some great videos.

232
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:11,671
Rym: Yep Like it is and it's kind of like there was a trend a while ago where people would like dress up as clowns or dress up as scary things or like leave weird dolls on people's porches.

233
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:18,280
Rym: these kinds of pranks are happening more and more because It's really easy to pull them off and now everyone has a camera on their door.

234
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:22,877
Rym: So it's really easy to like get people to spread your viral message.

235
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:23,619
Rym: Whatever it might be.

236
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:30,980
Rym: So in some other news As you all know Twitter is mostly filled with like Russian bots and Nazis and stuff.

237
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:41,400
Rym: there are some people talking but it's mostly bots and As you know China is trying to destroy Hong Kong and these kids are fighting for their lives to maintain some level of democracy there.

238
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:47,548
Rym: so China unlike Russia Does not know how to play the bot game.

239
00:13:48,170 --> 00:14:06,462
Rym: So basically over like the last few days The Chinese government it looks like they have just made thousands and thousands and thousands of bot accounts on Twitter and they're all tweeting the same Propaganda and it's so ham-fisted and so pathetically done Like.

240
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:12,863
Rym: it's like they're not even trying like they're doing the kind of bot attack that you would try to do in the 90s of social Media existed.

241
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:17,880
Rym: so there's this legion now of these accounts with like random art.

242
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,840
Scott: I mean it could just be really poorly skilled Chinese sympathizers and not China itself.

243
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,971
Rym: Yeah I do doubt it right.

244
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:31,614
Scott: like if you see in Australia There are like some students who are pro-china who are getting rowdy and I'm pretty confident.

245
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:33,360
Scott: Like I'm not have obvious information.

246
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,088
Rym: Oh, they're more like a standalone complex type situation.

247
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:36,991
Scott: I think that they're lit.

248
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:38,757
Scott: I think that they are just honestly.

249
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,563
Scott: they're from China They're Chinese.

250
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,520
Scott: They're in Australia and I think they're they're honestly just pro China.

251
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,680
Scott: Well, I like if some Trump people from America just went to France and got rowdy it's like they're just legitimately.

252
00:14:52,601 --> 00:15:00,626
Rym: However, I I would make the counter-argument that much like stochastic terrorism that is simply stochastic stochastic Memetics.

253
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:01,576
Rym: Yes, that is.

254
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:16,440
Scott: second But the point is there is still a difference between that and an actual government explicit directive like the CIA Operation to overthrow a government or something true, but then there's the weird gray line Like what about when the government just encourages people to do that?

255
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:22,963
Rym: And then there's unrelated to the government entities that funded and there's a shadowy circle of money Like.

256
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:23,967
Rym: what's the exact line?

257
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:25,011
Scott: It depends on a lot of things.

258
00:15:25,252 --> 00:15:34,505
Rym: so details if you see Twitter accounts talking about how bad these protesters are in Hong Kong Click on one or two of them.

259
00:15:34,746 --> 00:15:35,428
Rym: They probably.

260
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:39,440
Rym: you'll probably literally find thousands of accounts that are identical with no followers.

261
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,392
Rym: They were all created in August.

262
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:47,295
Rym: They have no followers They're following no one and they've all tweeted one thing which is a tweet with the same text.

263
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:52,240
Rym: and these like really obvious terrible propaganda images that are anti Hong Kong freedom.

264
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,732
Rym: What's really bothering me is that Twitter lets this shit happen.

265
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:59,060
Rym: Like this is so easy to stop, right?

266
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,020
Scott: It's like really you're this like one of the most major websites in you know applications in the world.

267
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:13,093
Scott: You have an army of talented programmers Some of them right and in the developers and designers and all kinds of people working there are huge and get all this money Even though you're not making money.

268
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:21,165
Scott: you got money And you can't just stop people from just making a bunch of fake accounts like the simplest thing that you can do with the WordPress Blog.

269
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:22,380
Scott: stop you from making fake accounts.

270
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,065
Scott: I mean you can't stop that.

271
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:36,760
Rym: click on any tweet by like any Democratic politician in the US and the replies are just thousands and thousands and thousands of obvious bots maybe hundreds, but the point is On the to make a Twitter account.

272
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:43,160
Scott: It shouldn't be so easy to just make an account and start tweeting that without being a real person.

273
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:43,918
Scott: How hard is this?

274
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,340
Rym: Well, I've said this on Twitter on Twitter a bunch of times But it's harder to make an account on our forum than it is on Twitter.

275
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:55,416
Rym: So what people seem to forget because it's before the living memory of most people online today.

276
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:56,740
Rym: Is that email?

277
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,455
Rym: Was kind of like Twitter and all these things anyone could just make an email server.

278
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:04,619
Rym: in the early days All email servers just trusted all other email servers.

279
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:13,073
Scott: Now you could well because in the beginning the only email servers were the few people that were on the internet And they were all sophisticated yep like colleges and labs and shit.

280
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:16,905
Rym: and then spam appeared and spam Literally overnight destroyed email.

281
00:17:16,984 --> 00:17:28,835
Rym: and the only reason the sole reason that we can still use email even exists today is because AI's Automatically block like ninety nine point nine nine percent of all email.

282
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:35,700
Scott: right a mad go to your email And I dare you to dump your spam folder on Gmail into your inbox, and it's unusable alright.

283
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:48,300
Scott: So the only reason email even exists today is because we invented and perfect or almost perfect And we didn't need to perfect people right very willing to lose the real emails just to Nazis right.

284
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:51,733
Scott: We made a good enough that got even better to be.

285
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:53,098
Scott: it's now really really good.

286
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,765
Scott: not perfect But extremely good.

287
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:58,080
Scott: spam filters and now email is usable and good again.

288
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:01,991
Scott: What in the meanwhile Twitter Facebook etc.

289
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:02,552
Scott: etc.

290
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,300
Scott: there's no spam filter on in the other way.

291
00:18:06,022 --> 00:18:09,716
Rym: Because you know in the early when spam first became a thing there were big debates about what to do.

292
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:16,540
Rym: people worried like oh Free speech like you can't block email content and we realized blocking email content was literally the only way.

293
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:23,160
Rym: The alternative was to charge a nominal amount of money to send an email and there was no way to make that happen.

294
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:32,660
Rym: No, but with something like Twitter Twitter could just say it costs one US dollar per year to have a Twitter account.

295
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:43,515
Rym: almost every bot account would disappear overnight because a dollar a year times millions of fake accounts is Not feasible for anyone to pay for and to be able to pay now.

296
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,904
Rym: There's an accountability traceability Aspect.

297
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:47,655
Scott: I think a better idea, right?

298
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,460
Scott: Which I've wanted to do for some time is to just have fines the same way that fines exist in like sports leagues.

299
00:18:55,841 --> 00:19:01,522
Scott: It's like I you did performance dancing drugs for game suspension and million-dollar fine or a hundred thousand dollar fine Whatever.

300
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:05,680
Scott: and the way you do this is you force everyone to have a credit card attached to their account.

301
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:09,500
Rym: So poor people can't use Twitter because they don't have credit cards or some kind of thing attached.

302
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,388
Rym: People can't use Twitter they don't have a bank account.

303
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:16,760
Rym: it's a positive some kind homeless person can't afford any amount of money.

304
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:18,110
Scott: You got to do something.

305
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:19,460
Scott: You got to have some amount of money.

306
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,890
Rym: That's why I'm saying the real way to do this point is have a eyes like literally just shadow ban 99.9% of all.

307
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,459
Scott: Twitter should be doing that also.

308
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:33,920
Scott: Yes fan filtering but just make people have some kind of deposit or some sort of thing linked to their account.

309
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:37,640
Scott: Check it to make sure it never like closes or goes away or anything.

310
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,880
Scott: So you don't just like use a stolen credit card, right?

311
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:44,889
Scott: And then if the person ever misbehaves if I can take all their money I do also still like the idea.

312
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:48,692
Scott: it's like you could do it for counter-strike like, okay You have to have a valid credit credit card.

313
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:54,578
Scott: you can play a free counter-strike But if you cheat we take you take the fold up and we take your full balance of credit card.

314
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:56,324
Scott: That's it Cheated.

315
00:19:56,485 --> 00:20:00,248
Scott: you got us $1,000 now cheater So the other even better.

316
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:03,360
Scott: give that cheating money to all the people you cheated against.

317
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:06,059
Scott: That'll make people want to play and not cheat.

318
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,651
Rym: Oh, did you see I was gonna save this news for Monday?

319
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,916
Scott: everyone who saw your spam.

320
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:10,900
Scott: now you owe them all a dollar.

321
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,269
Rym: Did you see all those kids who have fucking owned?

322
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:21,266
Rym: because all the counter-strike cheats on the internet are like really bad malware Mmm, and a bunch of?

323
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:24,980
Scott: I mean, I'm pretty sure like there are plenty of ways to get cheats for games.

324
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,039
Scott: But I imagine if you go to Google and type in fortnight cheats, you're not getting any fortnight sheets that work.

325
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:40,469
Scott: or To get the real fortnight sheets You got to go to the secret webs, you know and get in the IRC channel with the people who make the fortnight And be their friend.

326
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,319
Rym: these kids don't know what it was like to get wares.

327
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:43,298
Scott: No, they don't.

328
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:49,098
Rym: but I always think back to that idea we've had that we've never really tried to do anything with of you.

329
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:50,386
Rym: have you have a thing like Twitter.

330
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:56,093
Rym: that's invite only and Whoever invited you can cut you off if they want.

331
00:20:56,113 --> 00:21:04,840
Rym: so they're responsible for you And if - and basically if too many people you invited end up being pieces of shit you get kicked off the network.

332
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:05,605
Scott: Well, I think it's just.

333
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:07,540
Scott: you're responsible for the people under you, right?

334
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:14,767
Scott: So if I invite you and you invite Joey Jojo and Joey Jojo invites his uncle and the uncle invites a Nazi Right, Joey.

335
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:15,651
Scott: Jojo is just right.

336
00:21:15,711 --> 00:21:17,299
Scott: The uncle is responsible for getting rid of the Nazi.

337
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,573
Scott: Yeah, if he doesn't do it Joey Jojo is responsible for getting rid of the uncle.

338
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:22,060
Scott: Yeah, Joey Jojo doesn't do it.

339
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:25,919
Scott: You're responsible for getting rid of Joey Jojo and if you don't do it, I'm responsible for getting rid of you.

340
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:41,779
Scott: Yeah so it's like you're basically under this pressure from the top of whoever invited you because they're vouching for your Goodness on the network and you basically if you misbehave on the network Then you lose your standing and if no one is vouching for you on the network, then you're out.

341
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:43,539
Scott: Yeah, and it's it's really good.

342
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:50,180
Scott: The reason the system is good is because it solves this problem of prevent bots from joining and mass.

343
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:54,395
Scott: Because okay, Joey Jojo invites his uncle the uncle wants a Nazi.

344
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:59,520
Scott: the Nazi invites a bot network Although that you can just ban the Nazi and the whole bot network falls off.

345
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:05,160
Scott: You don't need to like, you know figure out individually with some advanced AI or spam filter type stuff.

346
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,089
Scott: Advanced AI though!

347
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:07,179
Rym: You don't need an advanced AI.

348
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,853
Rym: Just have something that looks for anyone who tweets the hashtag.

349
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,360
Rym: I stand with Vic and they're gone.

350
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,624
Scott: But the point is you can just.

351
00:22:12,644 --> 00:22:22,200
Scott: you can just drop huge numbers of accounts with like a single click really easily And it's very hard for anyone to flood the network with that biz.

352
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:22,761
Scott: But what's

353
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:34,716
Rym: funny about this China thing is that the Russian bots like all these Russian bot accounts have all this like Almost normal-looking activity that's scripted and you really got to look at it to find the trend of like, oh

354
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,361
Scott: they try hard Yeah,

355
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:39,452
Rym: but China's like not even trying like.

356
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,040
Scott: I don't know if China itself is doing it stuff.

357
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:45,092
Rym: It's either China directly or China stochastically.

358
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:46,598
Rym: It's one of those two.

359
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,796
Rym: So in some other news YouTube is changing how copyright claims work.

360
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:53,840
Scott: Well sort of right?

361
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,266
Rym: So they're only to read this article at all.

362
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:58,020
Scott: So the only way they're changing it is with regards to music, right?

363
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:03,260
Scott: So the way it works now is let's say you got a little bit of music in in your YouTube video.

364
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:05,327
Scott: I may be a little I don't know a little.

365
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:06,591
Scott: Rolling Stone maybe right?

366
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:09,320
Scott: So currently the Rolling Stones come along.

367
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:14,619
Scott: They could be like, all right Take that shit out of your video or we're gonna put ads on your video and make money.

368
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:19,000
Rym: And they can do that even if it's just like two seconds of the audio in the background of a four hour long.

369
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:23,257
Scott: So the new what they're changing it to is it basically gives them two choices.

370
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:29,894
Scott: now right choice Number one is They can prevent you from making money on the video which okay, but you can't.

371
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:39,220
Scott: they can't make any money that I like Right, so it's basically like okay We're you know more money for you person who made the video with my music in it, but no money for me either.

372
00:23:39,463 --> 00:23:40,320
Scott: I didn't make this video.

373
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,125
Rym: Oh, yeah, the article says this really well.

374
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:47,400
Rym: now when a copyright claim is manually filed specifically for very short clips, right?

375
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,468
Scott: So it's only manual Takedowns not the automatic takedowns.

376
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:54,220
Scott: Those are still the same and it's only for short clips.

377
00:23:54,904 --> 00:23:55,509
Scott: There's only two.

378
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:56,859
Scott: there's gonna be fewer choices.

379
00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:01,880
Scott: choice One is no money for anybody on this video and choice two is take the video down.

380
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,879
Scott: Now the problem is well the thinking behind this change is alright.

381
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:17,526
Scott: people who want to make money are incentivized to sort of go out and find any video with even a clip of their music in it and Claim it so they can make a lot of money Primarily because it's like a money.

382
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:22,048
Rym: those claims like if like all I a lot of my antenna videos have claims like that on them That I gave up on.

383
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:30,868
Scott: there's a monetary incentive like go out and claim every video that you can possibly claim and you will make some money and Clean them out and you'll make enough money.

384
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,233
Rym: Just go and do it.

385
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:43,520
Rym: There's also a disincentive from people who have Legitimate fair use rights like say me with do ten of videos to fight those claims because those claims don't actually take your video down.

386
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:46,220
Rym: You just lose ad revenue and someone else is making money.

387
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:51,280
Rym: But if you fight those claims you could get a copyright strike and you could lose your whole account.

388
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,940
Rym: Yeah, you lose my whole gig nights account by fighting one of those.

389
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:54,603
Rym: I usually don't.

390
00:24:54,644 --> 00:25:02,931
Scott: somehow YouTube does a good job of keeping people from making a thousand accounts Or at least you never see them right.

391
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:05,118
Scott: you just see the Nazis who have made real accounts.

392
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:08,260
Scott: Yeah Yeah, not bought Nazis anyway.

393
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:12,520
Scott: so The other option is to just take your video down.

394
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,400
Scott: So the thinking is people will stop take bothering with manual takedowns of short clips because they won't make money on it.

395
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:26,627
Scott: There's no incentive for them to go do this Manually, but the other thinking is like yeah People will probably just take down all these.

396
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:30,620
Scott: there'll be more takedowns and let instead of letting videos be up with.

397
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:36,160
Rym: Everyone involved in this doesn't understand about these music companies.

398
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:39,070
Rym: They would rather fucking just destroy you.

399
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,840
Scott: Well, some of them would write to them in my experience, right?

400
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,281
Scott: Well, I think it.

401
00:25:42,382 --> 00:25:43,787
Scott: you know, they're really aggressive.

402
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:46,195
Scott: America depends on the Japanese ones.

403
00:25:46,236 --> 00:25:47,480
Scott: They just want to take down everything.

404
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,604
Rym: Yeah, Japan like.

405
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:50,129
Rym: it's interesting when I get Japanese.

406
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,413
Rym: They're the worst against my videos.

407
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:53,400
Rym: They never monetize.

408
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,672
Rym: They just globally block instantly, right?

409
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:57,080
Rym: And actually a lot of my youtube videos.

410
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:04,399
Scott: Well, we just thought about Nintendo is aggressively going after videos that contain Nintendo music them and trying to take them down, right?

411
00:26:05,682 --> 00:26:09,942
Scott: But you know, it's clearly if you look at the evidence that is a dumb strategy Right.

412
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:18,280
Scott: Japan is a country with many people in it Right and creates as a lot of money and creates many things both physical and artwork and otherwise, right?

413
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:22,745
Rym: Yet kids ain't talking about j-pop these days They're talking about kpop.

414
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:28,866
Scott: Korea South Korea a very tiny country that may actually Mathematically people are concerned.

415
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:34,540
Scott: It's not a joke may run out of people because they're not making enough babies Right or they could allow more immigration.

416
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:43,550
Scott: Right a miniscule country on the scale of things with way less stuff than Japan Right has made a huge global impact.

417
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:50,847
Scott: right with music and our things that are popular worldwide simply because There are many reasons.

418
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:54,140
Scott: but the number one reason is they just let their shit spread.

419
00:26:54,422 --> 00:26:57,640
Scott: They just dump every to constantly uploading everything to YouTube.

420
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:05,080
Scott: They're constantly letting all their TV shows be KBS Which is basically like the the the national TV station, right?

421
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,800
Scott: They put most of their shows on YouTube with subtitles for free.

422
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:12,518
Scott: Oh, it's just like they just do it worldwide.

423
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:12,820
Scott: everyone.

424
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,825
Scott: Please watch Korean TV with subtitles.

425
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:21,566
Scott: and they just have been doing this for years and years and years like Ted like almost 10 years Maybe even that long.

426
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,209
Scott: I don't even know.

427
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:24,180
Scott: since 2012 when I started paying attention.

428
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:37,177
Scott: They become a global media phenomenon and Japan still to this day is like yeah Nintendo We're not gonna release mother 3 in the u.s Well, it's like yeah, you're making a remake or whatever.

429
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:37,840
Scott: you take that shit.

430
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,010
Scott: Oh, we're gonna take down every live stream.

431
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,597
Rym: Anyone's ever done of Zelda.

432
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:42,260
Scott: Yeah, j-pop.

433
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,195
Scott: We don't want anyone outside Japan to listen to that.

434
00:27:44,215 --> 00:27:44,840
Scott: take all that down.

435
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,352
Scott: No one's allowed to listen to j-pop unless they live in Japan.

436
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:47,835
Scott: j-rock.

437
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:48,156
Scott: Nope.

438
00:27:48,176 --> 00:27:48,820
Scott: Can't listen to it.

Scott: yes buy an $80 CD or $50-100 DVD.

00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:05,456
Scott: Maybe you know manga.

447
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:06,400
Scott: Yeah, I have ten bucks.

448
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:08,065
Scott: It's like Jesus Christ.

449
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:12,417
Scott: if Japan if I was like, but you know the I guess what?

450
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:16,111
Scott: Prime Minister Japan I would just be like.

451
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:16,960
Scott: look everybody.

452
00:28:17,722 --> 00:28:22,255
Scott: Put all media online with subtitles in every language possible for free.

453
00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:22,876
Scott: We're doing it.

454
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:23,177
Scott: Now.

455
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:24,180
Scott: This is the new policy.

456
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,603
Scott: Just government And Japan.

457
00:28:28,684 --> 00:28:34,480
Scott: if they did that they could even still even after all this bad juju of all these years of holding back.

458
00:28:35,142 --> 00:28:41,240
Scott: They could become like how almost Hollywood level media worldwide power if they just did that.

459
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:50,452
Scott: Imagine if you just watch all Japanese TV with subtitles all those wacky shows all the not wacky shows All the animes all the musics all the video games.

460
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:51,816
Scott: Just like just fucking do it.

461
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:52,880
Scott: Jesus Christ.

462
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:55,379
Rym: So there is a big problem with this change.

463
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:57,324
Rym: Quote from the article.

464
00:28:57,345 --> 00:29:00,576
Rym: youtubers themselves will have no say in the process.

465
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:01,499
Scott: No, they never do.

466
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,607
Rym: No No this you can't even dispute these.

467
00:29:03,627 --> 00:29:04,129
Rym: Uh-huh.

468
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:11,420
Scott: You cannot dispute these claims anymore All right, so I mean if you're trying to make money, so if I have a legitimate fair use video, I'm just fucked.

469
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,220
Scott: Well, I mean you can get your lawyer.

470
00:29:13,702 --> 00:29:23,611
Rym: Yeah, you have to get your lawyer which and by YouTube I can get my lawyer and I might be able to win because these are pretty clear-cut cases, but Random livestream kid cannot afford a lawyer.

471
00:29:23,751 --> 00:29:27,966
Scott: No, I think if it's a if your video gets taken down I feel like then you should be able to dispute.

472
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:33,405
Rym: but if they're removing the dispute process for this particular kind of claim Yeah, that's that's BS.

473
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:36,399
Scott: But if you're just get D monetized, right?

474
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:38,288
Scott: You know, there's a lot.

475
00:29:38,328 --> 00:29:41,086
Rym: if you just get D monetized honestly I don't care.

476
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:43,960
Rym: because right you're not making enough money from YouTube to live.

477
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:49,960
Scott: Well, even people who are making enough money from YouTube to live I basically have no simply like, you know people get all up in arms.

478
00:29:50,040 --> 00:30:04,980
Scott: Okay, that money comes from advertising which is already unethical right but or YouTube premium, but point is is like People because YouTube started paying creators, which I guess they should or shouldn't depending on how you feel about it, right?

479
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:11,860
Scott: It's like, you know Twitter doesn't pay me for my fucking tweets Facebook doesn't pay me for Facebook posts, right?

480
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,236
Rym: Maybe I should nationalize YouTube and just make it the national.

481
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:16,140
Scott: that would be a good thing.

482
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:25,993
Scott: But regardless it's like you don't have some right to be paid for putting your content on voluntarily Putting content on this other platform.

483
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:27,320
Scott: It's like you put it there.

484
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:28,746
Scott: It's like you're not get it there.

485
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:31,679
Scott: You're lucky that they're agreeing to pay you.

486
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,431
Scott: Well even right so they decide not to pay you.

487
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:36,640
Scott: I don't really think you have a lot of calls to complain.

488
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:39,680
Scott: You're lucky that it's even possible to make a penny from that.

489
00:30:39,961 --> 00:30:45,200
Rym: Yeah, like people don't seem to remember that the fact that I can just upload videos to the internet is still crazy.

490
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:47,828
Scott: Yeah, it's like you're lucky that they're even letting you do this.

491
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:48,751
Scott: That's great.

492
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:51,420
Scott: Yeah, it's like but yeah, it's of demonetization.

493
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:53,140
Scott: I have no, you know sympathy.

494
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:53,964
Scott: I think this is demon.

495
00:30:54,024 --> 00:30:57,480
Scott: I think they were as actually maybe a mistake to add any monetization to YouTube.

496
00:30:58,463 --> 00:31:05,774
Rym: And just you know, they should have provided API's for people who want to do whatever they're gonna do to self monetize or and then.

497
00:31:06,015 --> 00:31:13,999
Scott: but if you want to self monetize you Got to pay for the account Yeah, or something and all the bandwidth and or you share revenue with YouTube or something like something like that.

498
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:19,400
Rym: But well, we've talked about this before and I wanted to rail it because they take you down.

499
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,045
Scott: There should be a way to complain.

500
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:22,811
Rym: there isn't so we'll see how this goes.

501
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:32,884
Rym: Yeah, but it's time for things Of the day.

502
00:31:33,165 --> 00:31:37,556
Rym: so, you know, I like weird internet shit, I like shit posting like.

503
00:31:37,797 --> 00:31:38,438
Rym: I just enjoy that.

504
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:44,860
Rym: I enjoy Consuming a certain type of shit posting on the internet, but like old-school shit posting.

505
00:31:46,162 --> 00:31:52,040
Rym: So I found this weird hole on the internet of you know, like Simpson wave became kind of its own thing.

506
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:56,360
Rym: Yeah, I found a video that was called Simpsons old Jewish man posting

507
00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:57,143
Scott: Okay,

508
00:31:57,243 --> 00:32:12,000
Rym: and it was very specifically scenes from the Simpsons and then they would Re-cut the audio or like composite the scene or do something to insert that one old Jewish grandpa Who dances once in one episode?

509
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,846
Rym: Into the scene somehow.

510
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:16,739
Rym: Okay, and It was moderately funny.

511
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:28,390
Rym: but what stood out to me was the incredibly like high attention to detail and Craft that was put into this like this was whoever did this put way more effort effort than was warranted.

512
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,649
Scott: Well, it doesn't look like a long video, right?

513
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,086
Scott: If you had some Adobe software, it's not too much work skilled at it.

514
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,110
Scott: So I take me a while, but someone who was good at it would not take a while.

515
00:32:38,654 --> 00:32:46,154
Rym: I saw the one video and I thought maybe it was one of those situations Like I made one AMV and I put a lot of effort into it and I thought it was really good But I only made one.

516
00:32:46,174 --> 00:33:04,314
Rym: I thought someone made this shit posting joke once but then I saw Simpsons old Jewish man shitpost or man posting two and three and then I found a ton of videos made by a bunch of different people that are different kinds of Simpsons something.

517
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:05,700
Scott: they haven't been taken down.

518
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:18,369
Rym: They haven't been taken down and they're all really really like high production value for the type of content that it is and They're way funnier than they should be like way funnier.

519
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:23,552
Rym: So I'm gonna link to this one and I want to find out if you think this is funny as funny as I think it Is.

520
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:24,179
Rym: Mm-hmm.

521
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,249
Rym: So what do you got?

522
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:35,230
Scott: So one of the original nerderies from even before the time of personal computers before the time of vidya games But even before the time of tabletop RPGs.

523
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:48,120
Scott: You know back in the day if you were a nerd and the only things you had were maybe like miniatures war games like working on Cars or something collecting golden age comic books.

524
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:55,657
Scott: Yeah, something like that in those people didn't even really collect comic books in the golden Kids buying them and then throwing them out right.

525
00:33:55,898 --> 00:33:59,963
Scott: the collecting didn't happen till later really which is why golden aid comic books are rare and valuable.

526
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:07,810
Scott: Back in those days the key nerdery what we would have been doing if we were alive then is model trains.

527
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:11,231
Scott: Yep, model trains is like one of the core Nerderies.

528
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:15,885
Scott: the word hacking comes from the MIT model train club because somebody said that.

529
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:23,550
Scott: I don't know how true the story is But it's just story that's always told is that someone made a comment like ah those, you know, those train guys hacking away?

530
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:29,290
Scott: Right, because when you're working on model trains all the electronics are underneath the train board, right?

531
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:36,545
Scott: Where all the tracks are mounted and there's a whole bunch of wires and shit under there So you usually crawl under there and you hack away at all, you know shit.

532
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:37,989
Rym: I was really into this as a kid.

533
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:44,250
Rym: I had a whole bunch of big hardcover books that were like this instructional guides on how to do the train stuff.

534
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:45,835
Scott: I had an oval train.

535
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:47,161
Scott: we had a chain in a box.

536
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:49,130
Rym: So we had some liquid smoke.

537
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:52,969
Rym: We had a bunch of HO scale stuff, but that was just too small to work with and got him a pain in the ass.

538
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:59,210
Rym: We had a really old set of O scale and I had one of those like triple track ones, right?

539
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,779
Scott: So it's like Gundams.

540
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:08,190
Scott: if you do Gundam gunpla They have they always measure things and how big it is compared to how big a real Gundam would be.

541
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,641
Scott: So in Japan that giant Gundam, that's a 1-1 Gundam.

542
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:12,510
Scott: That's how big a Gundam would be if it was real.

543
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:25,630
Scott: Yeah, and when you make Gundams at home, you're usually doing like one one hundred one one thirty three Which means it needs to be a hundred or more times bigger than it is and then it would be the size of a real Gundam model trains have that same sort of scaling one slash number.

544
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,989
Scott: Yeah, it's like yeah If this was ten times bigger it would be the size of a real.

545
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:34,010
Rym: well We just looked up the one because there's like O and HO and there's this whole system, but they have a system of letters.

546
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:37,801
Scott: So it's like O. HO corresponds to numbers, right?

547
00:35:37,821 --> 00:35:40,850
Rym: So we looked up that's 1/5 scale, right?

548
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,490
Scott: So Gundams sort of do something similar, but not exactly the same.

549
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:55,140
Scott: We're like HG is 133 but so is RG but MG and NG are one hundred and like perfect grade of like 166 sometimes really big ones something like that.

550
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,304
Scott: I don't remember the exact numbers.

551
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:58,310
Scott: But yeah trains have the same thing.

552
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:06,360
Scott: So HO is one of the sizes of train that is standard and usually if you're a train person All the trains you get are in the same scale.

553
00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:08,690
Scott: because then you all your tracks work with the same.

554
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,563
Scott: All right, you get the tree all your trains link together, right?

555
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,049
Scott: Your trees won't be too big.

556
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:13,973
Scott: You're you're.

557
00:36:13,993 --> 00:36:14,455
Scott: you're.

558
00:36:14,595 --> 00:36:16,784
Scott: the station that you build would be the right size.

559
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:23,390
Scott: if you mix the stuff together Then it just doesn't work like you have a giant fucking tree or a. really your track will be too small.

560
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,930
Scott: All right, you want to buy all the stuff you buys in the same scale?

561
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:36,050
Rym: I wonder I gotta see if I can find someone who does like really advanced craft in model trains, but Does it all in the wrong fucked up scale?

562
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,606
Rym: So it looks weird and dystopian.

563
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:42,945
Scott: anyway My thing of the day is a video a train video and this person in the HO scale train set.

564
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:44,129
Scott: Is this Junji Ito?

565
00:36:45,715 --> 00:37:00,750
Scott: they made Just not like the usual thing that people make with trains which is like a fancy set with all sorts of finely crafted You know towns and people and all no no into any that they just made a huge ass fucking spiral of track.

566
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:07,150
Rym: Yeah They filled it with like the most basic sheep like coal and they made the longest fucking train.

567
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:23,470
Scott: That pretty much fills up the whole goddamn spiral and it's sort of I don't know Hypnotic and calming and whatever to watch because it's just so, you know Interesting and and to look at this is perfect spiral this train going around at a constant speed.

568
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:32,249
Scott: I think the most interesting thing is how many engines they had to intersperse between the coal cars To give it enough power to because one engine ain't pulling this train.

569
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:42,315
Rym: You need a lot of engine Right to move all them cars depending on the scale because of the smaller scales like sometimes all the cars will have motive power Just for reasons.

570
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:46,792
Rym: Yep depends, but this one looks like the trains themselves are motive and the cars are not There.

571
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:48,739
Scott: if you look at the person's channel, what's their name?

572
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:50,827
Scott: James Risner James Rizzi?

573
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:55,610
Scott: if you look at their channel It is full of you know similar kinds of videos.

574
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,359
Rym: Hot Wheels minecraft cars converted to HO scale.

575
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,730
Rym: long triple crown trailer train with HO ski up.

576
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,589
Scott: This is a train this person is making good stuff happen with HO scale trains.

577
00:38:07,112 --> 00:38:09,770
Rym: Tyco pulls long triple crown crane from dot dot dot.

578
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,212
Rym: There's a lot.

579
00:38:10,393 --> 00:38:14,209
Scott: this is a person who owns a lot of HO track and train and goes nuts with it.

580
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:19,701
Rym: So this is a hobby that as a kid I always wanted to get into and I like I'd make stuff and we had a little set.

581
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:27,936
Rym: but as I got even a little Bit older it like it went from being really interesting to being Terrifyingly boring.

582
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:28,178
Rym: my

583
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:43,850
Scott: friend's dad was big into it You know in the 90s early 2000s and they had a huge setup in the basement and would part when was part of like You know old-school mailing list forums with like AOL email To talk to the other old guys who didn't know how to use technology.

584
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:46,713
Scott: so I Think they were.

585
00:38:46,934 --> 00:38:49,690
Scott: he was doing bigger than HO scale though in the meta moment.

586
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,359
Rym: The GeekNights book club book is the first novel the tale of Genji.

587
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,730
Rym: We'll be live in Seattle real soon.

588
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:59,432
Scott: Oh, no on Friday, August 30th We'll add news.

589
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:00,456
Scott: some are coming to an end.

590
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:04,650
Scott: good news packs coming to a start and then this packs followed by packs and packs.

591
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,030
Scott: Yeah, I have some news.

592
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,575
Rym: Just booked my travel to packs.

593
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:07,996
Rym: unplug.

594
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:16,716
Scott: if you are going to PAX West to see or to see or not see us In 2019 in a couple few weeks Make sure you go and read.

595
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,884
Scott: there are lots of changes logistically to PAX West.

596
00:39:19,905 --> 00:39:21,870
Rym: They have added a ton of bullshit security.

597
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:32,190
Scott: Really fuck up your nose notable of which is a bunch of bullshit security And the consolidation of all tabletop stuff into the Hyatt Regency.

598
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:36,370
Rym: We're gonna be in the Hyatt for almost the entire time that is right.

599
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:42,910
Scott: Make sure you figure this stuff out before you go whether you or not you are a PAX veteran to get your shit together.

600
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:53,715
Rym: I'm a little sad because like a lot of my nostalgia of packs is just memories of being in the WCC in that tabletop area with the good small rooms that were quiet Yep, and now we'll now.

601
00:39:53,755 --> 00:40:02,937
Rym: basically I'm literally only gonna go into the WCC once Yep to do the expo hall video thing and then maybe not maybe Literally, that'll be the only time I go in.

602
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,017
Rym: that also means I probably won't go to that bodega because there's no reason to go To that bodega unless you're in the WCC.

603
00:40:09,177 --> 00:40:10,521
Scott: Yeah, we'll see.

604
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:29,017
Rym: Yeah, uh, if you are a Brave and normal person who realizes the security is all fake I highly urge you to complain to packs about this because based on a leak on a reddit It appears that it is read and the patent packs that wanted this fake security Not the city.

605
00:40:29,419 --> 00:40:30,745
Rym: No one forced this on them.

606
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:31,689
Scott: They asked for this.

607
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:39,530
Rym: Yep Which is a narrative that has people have tried to argue the opposite and we seem to have evidence that it is.

608
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:44,245
Rym: In fact Reed wanted this unlike say Boston where Boston forced it on conventions.

609
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:45,148
Rym: who did not want it.

610
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:48,038
Rym: Mm-hmm Thankfully magfest has none of this nonsense.

611
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,169
Scott: Yep, and hopefully anyone at magfest.

612
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:55,910
Scott: Yep I feel like if magfest afraid to go to I mean there are some reasons to be afraid to go to magfest.

613
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:00,650
Scott: Honestly, if magfest instituted this you should be more afraid of creepy dudes just creeping at magfest.

614
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:05,010
Rym: Then you are afraid of guns because magfest is a con that I go in and out of a lot.

615
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:08,450
Rym: Mm-hmm, if magfest added metal detectors, I would stop going to magfest.

616
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:09,996
Rym: I literally I would just stop going.

617
00:41:10,056 --> 00:41:14,553
Rym: probably would not be willing to because I go in and out of magfest like 20 times in The course of a day.

618
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:15,295
Scott: Yep packs.

619
00:41:15,335 --> 00:41:18,647
Rym: I tend to settle in the tabletop for like seven hours.

620
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:20,893
Rym: Yep All right.

621
00:41:20,933 --> 00:41:22,419
Rym: Let's talk about some fruits.

622
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,350
Scott: Yeah, so I tried to see if we did a fruit show.

623
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,810
Scott: We probably did in Rym deleted it, but we did do an Apple show way back in the day.

624
00:41:29,873 --> 00:41:30,250
Rym: Well, yeah.

625
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:37,151
Rym: So we did a show on apples to apples the game and we did a show on apples on the fruit on November 13th 2014.

626
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:37,513
Rym: Mm-hmm.

627
00:41:38,216 --> 00:41:39,260
Rym: So we can.

628
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,810
Rym: we are not allowed to talk about apples.

629
00:41:42,372 --> 00:41:44,984
Scott: I mean, we we obviously said everything we need to say about apples.

630
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,170
Rym: So just assume New York.

631
00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:47,585
Scott: Apple is the thing in New York.

632
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:53,140
Rym: Yeah And part of the reason why we're doing this show is that one People seem to really like it.

633
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,650
Rym: when we do like food episodes.

634
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,839
Rym: That's just like people love that and do.

635
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:04,426
Rym: Scott did not want to do any my other show ideas Which include such things as let's rank American cities from best to worst.

636
00:42:04,527 --> 00:42:05,510
Scott: I haven't been to that many.

637
00:42:05,611 --> 00:42:07,849
Rym: Let's talk about when you should call the cops.

638
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:09,594
Scott: Almost never.

639
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:12,301
Rym: let's talk about being stolen from cuz.

640
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:12,743
Rym: I've had a lot.

641
00:42:12,803 --> 00:42:14,387
Rym: I've had things stolen from me recently.

642
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,570
Scott: All right locks.

643
00:42:17,172 --> 00:42:19,349
Rym: I feel like we could do a whole show just on cured fish.

644
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:22,096
Scott: I don't ever need that many cured fish.

645
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:25,084
Rym: spices good spices bad spices that cardamom.

646
00:42:25,184 --> 00:42:26,548
Scott: action fruits are better than spices.

647
00:42:26,568 --> 00:42:30,940
Rym: luggage The worst we've ever been on car accidents.

648
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:31,561
Scott: Yeah.

649
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:33,266
Rym: Anyway, we're gonna talk about fruit.

650
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:38,664
Rym: Okay, so Scott What is your favorite fruit related joke in media?

651
00:42:38,925 --> 00:42:39,266
Scott: Why why?

652
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:39,849
Scott: no, no, no, no.

653
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,960
Scott: Let's talk about the actual fruits that you eat.

654
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:43,562
Scott: right?

655
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,810
Scott: melons, you know stone fruit.

656
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:47,965
Rym: So I gotta get this out of the way cuz we have to.

657
00:42:48,005 --> 00:42:51,902
Scott: we've argued a lot I gotta say I gotta say something in general about all fruits.

658
00:42:52,143 --> 00:42:56,601
Rym: right it applies even to Apple I think not allowed to talk about Apple son.

659
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:01,637
Scott: a lot of people out there right are You know have opinions, you know, they like some fruits.

660
00:43:01,657 --> 00:43:02,439
Scott: They don't like others.

661
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:02,700
Scott: Right?

662
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:08,074
Scott: The thing is just about every fruit is Delicious except for a few.

663
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:10,160
Scott: and the thing is though.

664
00:43:10,241 --> 00:43:11,204
Rym: I think there are a lot of fruit.

665
00:43:11,224 --> 00:43:11,926
Rym: You have never eaten.

666
00:43:12,307 --> 00:43:14,196
Scott: That's true also There.

667
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:18,717
Scott: but any one of those delicious fruits Can be gross.

668
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:23,010
Scott: a fruit is only delicious when it is at the correct level of ripeness.

669
00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:24,649
Scott: I don't think a lot of people

670
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:25,532
Rym: form

671
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:41,954
Scott: an opinion about a fruit when they eat one that is not a good example of that fruit and then are Unwilling, you know if it is actually depending on where they live may or may not be hard to get a good Version or variety of that fruit They go.

672
00:43:42,055 --> 00:43:43,825
Scott: Oh, I hate that fruit and they won't even eat it anymore.

673
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:44,590
Scott: Cuz they're closed-minded.

674
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:45,733
Rym: I think they don't.

675
00:43:46,234 --> 00:43:50,766
Rym: that has this to the highest degree of any fruit in the United States.

676
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:55,860
Rym: is the pair the pair Absolutely the pair because a bad pair it tastes like sand.

677
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,241
Scott: That's right.

678
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:59,410
Scott: a pair that is not good basically tastes like nothing.

679
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:03,475
Scott: It's just like you're eating fruit Cellulose material.

680
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,944
Rym: this was even a long-form joke on.

681
00:44:06,025 --> 00:44:12,890
Rym: it's always sunny in Philadelphia Cuz there's a character Charlie who they're like on a road trip and it comes out that he has never had a page.

682
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,701
Rym: He doesn't know what a pair is never heard of.

683
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:16,209
Rym: a pair never eaten a pair.

684
00:44:16,852 --> 00:44:20,508
Rym: So they go to get him a pair and he just like oh and he's really excited.

685
00:44:20,528 --> 00:44:20,910
Rym: He bites it.

686
00:44:21,011 --> 00:44:23,469
Rym: He's like, uh, it just tastes like sand and nothing.

687
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:25,990
Rym: And then there's this whole bit about oh, it's not right.

688
00:44:26,572 --> 00:44:30,650
Rym: Pears are real dangerous because I would argue that most pairs are bad.

689
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:33,423
Scott: Yeah, most pairs are bad not varieties of pairs.

690
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:34,790
Rym: all varieties of pairs are great.

691
00:44:35,111 --> 00:44:39,565
Rym: It's that most pairs are either not ripe overripe package poorly.

692
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:41,190
Rym: They there's some problem with.

693
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:41,553
Scott: Why is it?

694
00:44:41,573 --> 00:44:42,379
Scott: you get there hard?

695
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:43,950
Scott: They're not juicy enough.

696
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:49,610
Rym: Usually it's probably something was done to prevent them from ripening so they could ship them right and then they never like ripen.

697
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,653
Scott: well that is that is.

698
00:44:50,673 --> 00:44:58,610
Scott: the number one reason that people end up with bad fruits that don't taste good is because If you buy a fruit, let's say, you know a banana, right?

699
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:07,330
Scott: What they do is that banana is grown way near the equator, right, you know If you don't live down in tropical areas, no bananas fucking growing in New York.

700
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:11,185
Scott: Yes, you got some kind of crazy greenhouse set up for some shit, which I don't think anyone does.

701
00:45:11,245 --> 00:45:12,430
Scott: so they got to use chemicals.

702
00:45:14,352 --> 00:45:24,786
Scott: They spray things right to trick the banana into ripening or not ripening and The result is that they ship the banana to you super green.

703
00:45:25,148 --> 00:45:27,979
Scott: then, you know It gets yellow and then it turns brown right away.

704
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:42,279
Scott: You can actually do some tricks, you know Using these gases on your own if you can acquire them To you know control the ripening of the fruit like the old trip of putting in trick of putting an apple in a bag With certain other fruits things like that.

705
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:42,560
Rym: Yep.

706
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,525
Rym: There's all sorts of tricks.

707
00:45:43,545 --> 00:45:43,806
Rym: You can do.

708
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:44,510
Rym: look at the fun line.

709
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,736
Scott: We're not just that.

710
00:45:45,856 --> 00:45:52,590
Scott: it's simply because a fruit that travels Just loses flavor period regardless of how good it was to begin with.

711
00:45:52,771 --> 00:46:00,081
Scott: If you go to Florida and you go to the grocery and get some pineapples It's like that came from a nearby pineapple place.

712
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:03,918
Scott: if you go to Hawaii where there's a pineapple farm and eat a pineapple It's fucking delicious.

713
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,488
Scott: See the same pineapple in New York.

714
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:08,598
Rym: So usually what happens there?

715
00:46:08,618 --> 00:46:09,784
Rym: because there's two factors of play.

716
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:10,870
Rym: It's actually pretty complex.

717
00:46:11,011 --> 00:46:11,332
Rym: I don't want to.

718
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,669
Rym: I don't think we should try to get too deep into it because we are not experts in this.

719
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:21,950
Rym: But on one hand these techniques end up giving you a very narrow window where it will actually be the right amount of ripe.

720
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:31,210
Rym: So you can get a really good pineapple in New York But the odds of any given pineapple being at that moment of ripeness at the time you cut it up to eat it pretty low.

721
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,890
Scott: I've actually learned how to tell when a pineapple is ready if it's all green obviously too soon.

722
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,740
Scott: Yeah, if it's all brown, it's obviously mushy and bad.

723
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,790
Scott: You want the pineapple because you know has a little like little hexagons.

724
00:46:42,371 --> 00:46:46,903
Scott: You want each hexagon to be brown with green around the edges.

725
00:46:46,943 --> 00:46:49,530
Scott: you want green on the edges and you want brown in the middle.

726
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:50,618
Scott: And that's a pineapple.

727
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:51,968
Scott: open that shit up eat it right now.

728
00:46:52,471 --> 00:47:01,564
Scott: but every time I go to the grocery store in New York, the pineapples are either green usually green and Occasionally super brown super rare to find one that's in between.

729
00:47:01,624 --> 00:47:03,050
Rym: That's why I end up with pineapple.

730
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:06,225
Rym: I tend to get a like package pre-cut pineapples.

731
00:47:06,245 --> 00:47:07,190
Scott: It's so much more money.

732
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:10,077
Rym: If you buy a whole pineapple is four dollars.

733
00:47:10,378 --> 00:47:14,850
Scott: a tiny can of delicious canned pineapple will be like two or three dollars.

734
00:47:15,051 --> 00:47:15,633
Scott: Yeah, right.

735
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:17,703
Scott: It's like you put a whole pineapple for a dollar more.

736
00:47:17,723 --> 00:47:18,988
Scott: if you can only find it's got it in my 30s.

737
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,261
Rym: Wait a whole pineapple.

738
00:47:20,322 --> 00:47:20,950
Rym: I'm gonna be sick.

739
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:24,869
Scott: I share I cut it up and I put it in a container and I eat it slowly or share it.

740
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:40,443
Rym: No, but the other factor is that What constitutes a forgiven fruit is a really complicated question because there are a lot of Technically fruits We can head.

741
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:58,181
Rym: that technically very We can head that off because and uh, if you go to the Wikipedia article just go there's a section it's the first section in the fruit page of Wikipedia that talks about the difference between Fruit as a botanic term and fruit as a culinary term.

742
00:47:58,241 --> 00:47:59,083
Rym: Haha.

743
00:47:59,204 --> 00:47:59,966
Rym: We are saved.

744
00:47:59,986 --> 00:48:02,233
Scott: we can avoid that fucking art Talking for that.

745
00:48:02,274 --> 00:48:04,022
Scott: We are talking about culinary fruits.

746
00:48:04,323 --> 00:48:05,750
Scott: I don't give a shit about your botanic fruits.

747
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:07,736
Rym: Here's the definition of culinary fruit.

748
00:48:07,776 --> 00:48:12,230
Rym: in case you want to be a pet in a fruit is usually any sweet tasting plant part.

749
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:13,478
Scott: Yeah, fuck.

750
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:14,143
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

751
00:48:14,223 --> 00:48:16,133
Scott: Take that full Definition.

752
00:48:16,153 --> 00:48:17,056
Scott: stop me now.

753
00:48:17,156 --> 00:48:19,222
Rym: if it came off a sugary plant I eat it.

754
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:22,134
Rym: It's like yeah, if it's even remotely sweet It's a fruit.

755
00:48:22,597 --> 00:48:22,899
Rym: Fuck it.

756
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:23,927
Scott: Take that.

757
00:48:24,088 --> 00:48:26,536
Scott: Yeah Yeah, go fruits.

758
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:34,690
Rym: All right, but with all these cultivars and everything What that means is that you look at ten different apples ten different sets of grapes.

759
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:40,708
Rym: they could have drastically different tastes drastically different ripening periods everything.

760
00:48:40,868 --> 00:48:49,170
Rym: oh, yeah, and Generally the things that make a fruit easier to transport long distances tend to make it less flavorful.

761
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:54,449
Rym: That's why the grapes you get in the grocery store are all like Concord grapes because they have a really thick skin.

762
00:48:54,753 --> 00:48:55,550
Scott: Oh, that's where we live.

763
00:48:55,672 --> 00:49:00,550
Rym: They can make Concord grapes near here But also because they have a really thick skin and they're really easy to transport.

764
00:49:00,931 --> 00:49:06,746
Rym: But like the best grapes are the ones that have such thin skins that if you look at them the wrong way They just disintegrate.

765
00:49:08,092 --> 00:49:21,001
Scott: I think it's just part of the way that the history of you know fruit growing and generally, you know Agriculture in general is that they have been breeding, you know Things to you know have lots of features.

766
00:49:21,342 --> 00:49:30,290
Scott: right like doesn't get killed by bugs Grows real big, you know, you know stays in good shape and condition looks nice.

767
00:49:30,632 --> 00:49:38,622
Scott: they've been breeding for all these factors and Somehow flavor was not one of the factors that was emphasized in the u.s.

768
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:39,966
Scott: In particular all the others.

769
00:49:40,006 --> 00:49:45,630
Rym: There was a trend to focus on Consistency over good flavor, right?

770
00:49:45,991 --> 00:49:49,836
Scott: So the result is that you know It's like they could and they probably.

771
00:49:49,896 --> 00:50:02,936
Scott: there are people who probably are working on right cultivating fruits vegetables Whatever that have all the other good qualities like durable easy to grow Those Right Zima tomatoes or whatever.

772
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:07,270
Rym: They're way more flavorful than just like red cherry tomatoes, but also tastes great.

773
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:21,350
Scott: But the fact is most of the great tasting varieties of things that are grown Do not have those other features already bred into them and they end up being rarer more expensive can only get them locally.

774
00:50:22,551 --> 00:50:24,918
Rym: They end up being difficult to grow.

775
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:29,189
Scott: Yeah, I tried to grow a fancy strawberry and it didn't work out Shitty.

776
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:42,001
Rym: Apparently, this is a big thing among people who grow cannabis like hobbyists because the really high quality cannabis plants They call them prima donnas because they're just.

777
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:43,487
Rym: if anything goes wrong like fuck it.

778
00:50:43,547 --> 00:50:45,053
Rym: I'm just gonna die I give up.

779
00:50:45,655 --> 00:50:48,124
Rym: but if you get a shitty cannabis plant, it's just invincible.

780
00:50:48,164 --> 00:50:49,650
Scott: It's like the weed it makes us crappy.

781
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:50,797
Rym: Yeah, the weed it makes us crappy.

782
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:51,442
Scott: Like you don't want that.

783
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:52,669
Rym: we fruits are the same way.

784
00:50:52,891 --> 00:50:54,602
Scott: Oh, I think all agriculture is the same.

785
00:50:54,662 --> 00:50:54,904
Scott: Yep.

786
00:50:54,984 --> 00:50:59,530
Scott: That's just how it goes At least in terms of things we're eating or consuming like potatoes.

787
00:50:59,872 --> 00:51:06,210
Rym: We bred potatoes to be less poisonous so we can eat them But that makes them prone to being eaten by other animals and bugs and stuff.

788
00:51:06,451 --> 00:51:12,456
Rym: If you go in the wild and dig up like a random to mate like a random potato out in the woods It'll probably fucking kill you.

789
00:51:12,476 --> 00:51:14,142
Scott: Yeah, I thought that was a rumor.

790
00:51:14,222 --> 00:51:16,229
Rym: No wild potatoes are dangerous as shit.

791
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:21,689
Rym: Anyway, lots of wild like things that look like carrots in the wild can be very toxic as well.

792
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,919
Rym: Lots of wild or the worst are squashes.

793
00:51:25,441 --> 00:51:34,140
Rym: if your garden if you're growing squashes in your garden The kinds of squashes we eat tend to taste really good But they you need to do a lot of care to make them grow.

794
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,092
Scott: All right, so worst possible fruit Grapefruit.

795
00:51:38,372 --> 00:51:39,636
Rym: Well grapefruits are delicious.

796
00:51:39,716 --> 00:51:41,161
Scott: The fuck's wrong is the worst.

797
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:44,270
Rym: free grapefruit juice is my favorite juice.

798
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:47,123
Scott: Now a grapefruit is first of all granted.

799
00:51:47,183 --> 00:51:48,570
Scott: I'm even if it tasted good.

800
00:51:48,911 --> 00:51:54,449
Rym: Really have the the xkcd strip called quote fuck a grapefruit up on the screen right now?

801
00:51:56,172 --> 00:52:00,306
Rym: No, okay, I'll talk about this chart in a minute cuz it's important.

802
00:52:00,426 --> 00:52:01,470
Scott: so a grapefruit, right?

803
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:02,936
Scott: Here's all the problems with a grapefruit number one.

804
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:03,478
Scott: It tastes bad.

805
00:52:03,499 --> 00:52:04,181
Rym: It tastes delicious.

806
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:05,065
Rym: Your is your.

807
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:06,070
Scott: it is sour.

808
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:09,299
Rym: Bad way it is sour in a wonderful way.

809
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:10,102
Scott: I could eat a lemon.

810
00:52:10,182 --> 00:52:13,412
Scott: I could eat a lime just um, but a grapefruit It's just like.

811
00:52:13,432 --> 00:52:15,219
Scott: it's like it's like acid.

812
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,725
Scott: It's like burning nasty.

813
00:52:17,186 --> 00:52:18,130
Rym: I think I battery.

814
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:22,170
Rym: I think I could eat an entire grapefruit before you could eat an entire lemon.

815
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:27,170
Scott: Alright, so second problem with grapefruit right is that it's kind of big.

816
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:29,244
Scott: It's like an orange is a good size.

817
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:30,050
Scott: I could eat a whole orange.

818
00:52:30,271 --> 00:52:33,061
Rym: There are oranges that are as big as grapefruits.

819
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:35,690
Scott: You don't eat those look like a navel orange a navel orange.

820
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:36,714
Scott: I can eat a whole navel orange.

821
00:52:36,855 --> 00:52:38,642
Rym: There's some grapefruits are about that size.

822
00:52:39,124 --> 00:52:40,410
Scott: Yeah, grapefruits are too big.

823
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:41,937
Scott: You can't eat the whole grapefruit.

824
00:52:41,997 --> 00:52:44,910
Scott: usually end up chopping it in half and the other half goes in the fridge.

825
00:52:45,153 --> 00:52:47,156
Scott: It gets even more sour Right.

826
00:52:47,176 --> 00:52:47,700
Scott: All right.

827
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,597
Scott: number three to eat a grapefruit You can't just like an orange.

828
00:52:50,617 --> 00:52:52,889
Scott: you can peel it and then break it into wedges and eat it.

829
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:53,712
Scott: Yeah an apple.

830
00:52:53,732 --> 00:52:55,117
Scott: you can just bomb into it.

831
00:52:55,197 --> 00:52:58,769
Scott: a banana peel it just on right a watermelon or a pineapple.

832
00:52:58,789 --> 00:52:59,130
Scott: you cut it.

833
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,455
Rym: Yeah to your credit.

834
00:53:00,495 --> 00:53:00,756
Rym: There is.

835
00:53:00,776 --> 00:53:03,064
Rym: there's a reason why there's a fruit you got.

836
00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:04,570
Scott: you need a fucking weird-ass spoon.

837
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:06,096
Scott: There's a holy grandma has.

838
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:09,390
Rym: there's a pop culture meme from the 80s that mostly disappeared.

839
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,238
Rym: Like it's not in modern media really.

840
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:20,229
Rym: if you watch old 80s movies old TV shows There will always be a joke about someone in the family is eating a grapefruit for breakfast and it squirts someone else in the

841
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:31,108
Scott: eye Right and you use the grapefruit like sharp like serrated spoon and it'll still squirt you in the eye Right, which is the thing that really happens in a special spoon for this fucking fruit and only grandma

842
00:53:31,148 --> 00:53:31,570
Rym: has one.

843
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:32,574
Rym: All right, so Scott I'm gonna.

844
00:53:32,715 --> 00:53:34,142
Rym: actually I'm gonna almost agree with you.

845
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:35,710
Rym: We are talking about fruit.

846
00:53:35,991 --> 00:53:47,854
Rym: We are not talking about fruit juice because and this gets me to this chart fruit juice Removes like there are fruits that are a pain in the ass to eat or prepare that Prickly pear.

847
00:53:47,874 --> 00:53:53,904
Rym: that being said quickly pair one time delicious fruit And I will never try to prepare you again in my life.

848
00:53:54,125 --> 00:54:00,150
Scott: that being said one time I went and I bought some orange juice and I didn't realize it was orange grapefruit juice and it tasted like poison.

849
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,673
Scott: I threw it out.

850
00:54:00,994 --> 00:54:02,784
Rym: No grapefruit juice is delicious.

851
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,990
Rym: No, but I'll agree with you here.

852
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:08,409
Rym: I do not like to eat grapefruit as a fruit, but I love grapefruit juice.

853
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:12,410
Scott: Yeah So this xkcd see me in a perfect one is grow.

854
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,818
Rym: This is the most important thing to talk about fruit.

855
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:15,561
Rym: We discount juice.

856
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:18,190
Rym: This xkcd strip is called fuck grapefruit.

857
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:19,656
Scott: Oh a wise person.

858
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:22,870
Scott: Randall Monroe knows how great fruit is disgusting.

859
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:28,090
Rym: But the important thing is this is the most important one Scott plus Randall Monroe versus Rym.

860
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:35,885
Rym: There are only two axes you to one for which you there only two axes to describe fruit.

861
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:38,353
Rym: one axis is Difficulty.

862
00:54:38,655 --> 00:54:40,683
Rym: how easy it is it to prepare and eat?

863
00:54:40,984 --> 00:54:42,530
Rym: how difficult is it to prepare and eat?

864
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:46,485
Rym: The other axis is is it tasty or is it on tasty?

865
00:54:46,927 --> 00:54:47,530
Rym: case in point?

866
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:53,890
Rym: Seeded grapes very tasty but much more difficult to eat then unsee than seedless grapes.

867
00:54:54,331 --> 00:55:03,100
Rym: Seedless grapes not as tasty but so much easier to eat that most people prefer seedless grapes Yeah, but like seedless watermelon.

868
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:14,260
Scott: whenever I go to the grocery whenever I get grapes At the grocery is one of the only things at the grocery It's you're allowed to eat one of each color grape Yep at the grocery to test to see if they're good.

869
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,710
Scott: and then if they're good then you buy great.

870
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:20,824
Scott: Yeah But you can always eat one green grape and one red grape at the grocery to test them out.

871
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:25,564
Scott: because this chart shows a lot Of times you go to the grocery you eat a great but it's like that's tasteless not buying those.

872
00:55:25,765 --> 00:55:28,070
Rym: but this chart then allows us To make four quadrants.

873
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,699
Rym: So in the upper right quadrant are the magic fruit.

874
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:38,665
Rym: the fruit are the tasty ones that are easy to eat and the king Of those on this chart is a combination of peaches strawberries and blueberries, right?

875
00:55:38,685 --> 00:55:40,250
Rym: So I don't disagree with no.

876
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,578
Scott: So the thing with peach though, it's like strawberry.

877
00:55:42,658 --> 00:55:43,661
Scott: It's like you can it's.

878
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:45,206
Scott: you can kind of get good strawberries.

879
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:48,015
Rym: Oh good peach Good peach.

880
00:55:48,256 --> 00:55:50,630
Scott: if you live in Georgia, you're just like buried in them, right?

881
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,360
Scott: You can just get them all over in New York.

882
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:54,030
Scott: It's hard to get good peach.

883
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,724
Rym: Oh my if I get a good if I get a peach as a rock.

884
00:55:56,925 --> 00:55:59,194
Rym: and when I say this good It goes when I say peach.

885
00:55:59,335 --> 00:56:00,218
Scott: I don't just mean peach.

886
00:56:00,378 --> 00:56:03,830
Scott: I mean all varieties of peach white peach yellow peach, California peach.

887
00:56:04,132 --> 00:56:05,680
Scott: I mean nectarine, which is just a peach.

888
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,363
Scott: It's not fuzzy.

889
00:56:06,383 --> 00:56:07,550
Scott: Yeah, I mean plum.

890
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:08,674
Scott: I mean pretty much.

891
00:56:08,874 --> 00:56:10,018
Scott: all those are not peaches.

892
00:56:10,299 --> 00:56:14,836
Scott: all of the I know but I mean all the same things all those stone fruits Okay, so yes, I do.

893
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:17,024
Scott: all of those have the same problem there.

894
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:23,170
Scott: I when you go to the grocery in New York they're either hard as a fucking rock or mushy and disgusting.

895
00:56:25,434 --> 00:56:27,350
Scott: If you take one home that's hard as a rock.

896
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:33,530
Scott: You have to sit there and look at it and wait for it to be a little squishy then eat it immediately and the second One you bought will already be mush.

897
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:38,882
Rym: No and whenever you say look at it you have to literally just sit in the room with it and wait if you like leave the Room to go to the bathroom.

898
00:56:38,923 --> 00:56:39,309
Rym: We come back.

899
00:56:40,655 --> 00:56:41,399
Scott: No pile of mold.

900
00:56:41,419 --> 00:56:43,809
Scott: So I buy one at a time and I wait for it to be good.

901
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:44,491
Rym: now I eat it.

902
00:56:44,612 --> 00:56:46,739
Rym: So this is where Randall Monroe made a mistake.

903
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,304
Rym: There is a third axis.

904
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:49,648
Rym: The axes is risk.

905
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:52,118
Rym: How risky is this fruit?

906
00:56:52,299 --> 00:56:55,150
Scott: Yep, so I fruit and then well it goes bad.

907
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:55,753
Scott: You just lost it.

908
00:56:55,913 --> 00:57:02,269
Rym: and if you take risk into account or even if it doesn't go bad like grapes They don't really go bad so much as some grapes are just bitter.

909
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:05,765
Scott: Well, yeah, those are bad, but you don't you don't risk it cuz you taste like.

910
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:06,870
Rym: oh they got like it.

911
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,265
Scott: So taste them before you buy them.

912
00:57:08,286 --> 00:57:14,290
Rym: Yeah But as a result, but strawberries tend to just be good or rotten, but they tend to be good a lot longer.

913
00:57:14,491 --> 00:57:16,297
Scott: I've heard about a special strawberry.

914
00:57:16,338 --> 00:57:17,582
Scott: That's like the best driver.

915
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,610
Rym: Oh, I saw people tweeting about that the other day.

916
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:20,595
Scott: Well, no, that was a melon.

917
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:21,640
Scott: They were tweeting about.

918
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:23,410
Rym: I also saw people tweeting about the melon.

919
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:27,086
Rym: I didn't see strawberry the head the heirloom melon that has gone from this earth.

920
00:57:27,126 --> 00:57:28,130
Rym: and there's another melon.

921
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,598
Rym: That's the closest thing you can get to it.

922
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:30,182
Rym: Yes.

923
00:57:30,222 --> 00:57:31,368
Scott: I'm gonna try to get that melon.

924
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:33,904
Rym: Oh, yeah I was thinking about that kind of like how they gross me Cal.

925
00:57:33,924 --> 00:57:34,810
Rym: It's hard to get.

926
00:57:35,112 --> 00:57:37,105
Rym: Yeah, and that's what old bananas taste like.

927
00:57:37,206 --> 00:57:40,777
Rym: Yep Bananas are complicated because bananas are pretty good.

928
00:57:40,797 --> 00:57:41,359
Rym: They're not great.

929
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:42,041
Scott: I love banana.

930
00:57:42,281 --> 00:57:42,863
Rym: I like bananas.

931
00:57:42,923 --> 00:57:46,536
Rym: Okay, I actually prefer plantains But that doesn't count as fruit.

932
00:57:46,637 --> 00:57:48,627
Scott: It depends because that is something I just eat.

933
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:49,210
Scott: a fucking plan.

934
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,678
Rym: Plantain is something you cook that is savory.

935
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,570
Rym: It does not count because we were talking about botanical fruit whatever.

936
00:57:56,794 --> 00:57:57,989
Rym: So what about the melons?

937
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,040
Scott: There's a lot of good melons out because I was talking.

938
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,340
Rym: I was at work literally a couple days ago because where I work You know money melon.

939
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:08,057
Rym: every morning There's just four cups of fruit for anyone who wants them.

940
00:58:08,257 --> 00:58:12,509
Scott: Mm-hmm and bring me home for those people that I talked to hate honeydew.

941
00:58:13,132 --> 00:58:17,454
Rym: Okay, like people don't like honeydew and I don't understand why the money I mean honeydew.

942
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:22,448
Rym: the money melon is a great melon, but I think the problem is honeydew is like other.

943
00:58:22,508 --> 00:58:23,150
Rym: it's like pears.

944
00:58:23,472 --> 00:58:24,661
Rym: Most people have bad honeydews.

945
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:28,112
Scott: That's also true But I do think you know It is.

946
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:35,541
Scott: even though a good even a good honeydew the flavor of the good honeydew is not Powerful right handy if you get a really ripe one.

947
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:37,810
Scott: Yes, but it's mostly a milder fruit.

948
00:58:38,272 --> 00:58:42,550
Scott: So when you eat it, even if it's you know, it's it's like alright, I taste delicious honeydew.

949
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:46,182
Scott: But it's like, you know, most honeydews are not the most delicious.

950
00:58:46,202 --> 00:58:48,530
Scott: They're often a little firm and tough.

951
00:58:48,994 --> 00:58:56,290
Scott: They don't like Like say watermelon or cute or even cantaloupe, but if you get a good honeydew, it's a strong flavor.

952
00:58:56,835 --> 00:58:58,290
Rym: It just melts in your mouth.

953
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:02,341
Scott: Most people not had a good honeydew and even the best honeydew.

954
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:04,006
Scott: It's like it's great.

955
00:59:04,126 --> 00:59:04,928
Scott: It's the money melon.

956
00:59:04,989 --> 00:59:10,650
Scott: I want it I want to eat it Yeah, but it's just not it like if it can put the best honeydew in the best cantaloupe and the best watermelon.

957
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:12,397
Scott: The honeydew is less powerful.

958
00:59:12,497 --> 00:59:13,240
Scott: It's less sweet.

959
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,589
Scott: It's less delicious less sugary, you know.

960
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:20,230
Rym: Watermelon is interesting because it doesn't have that strong a flavor either.

961
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,501
Rym: But what I like about watermelon is I can just eat.

962
00:59:22,762 --> 00:59:27,521
Rym: well good watermelon has a strong flavor Yeah, but you can eat as much what you could just eat watermelon forever.

963
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:29,227
Scott: Well, it's mostly water exactly.

964
00:59:29,267 --> 00:59:29,749
Scott: He's got a fee.

965
00:59:31,211 --> 00:59:32,858
Scott: That's why it's mushier than the honeydew.

966
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,390
Rym: I have an anecdote from when I was a young child.

967
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:37,606
Rym: I was like six or seven years old maybe younger.

968
00:59:37,626 --> 00:59:38,150
Rym: I don't know.

969
00:59:39,352 --> 00:59:40,679
Rym: I could try to figure out how old I was.

970
00:59:40,901 --> 00:59:46,949
Rym: But basically we had a Gigantic watermelon like a huge one and we cut the whole thing up.

971
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:48,830
Scott: sure He doesn't remember it being big cuz you were small.

972
00:59:48,971 --> 00:59:49,355
Rym: No, it was.

973
00:59:49,416 --> 00:59:58,800
Rym: it was big like the whole thing Like we were talking about like this is a big watermelon like, uh-huh so anyway, the per that what it was all this man was I Basically ate the whole fucking thing.

974
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:06,389
Rym: Mm-hmm and the family I kind of mad at me cuz I like literally just ate the whole thing Over the course of like the morning and I kept having to pee.

975
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,298
Rym: Mm-hmm I had to pee so much that I kept going.

976
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:28,630
Rym: I went to the bathroom peed again and again and again and again cuz I Basically drank like a gallon and a half of watermelon juice And I was young and at some point apparently I started crying Because I was peeing so much that I thought I was gonna pee forever And I was worried that I wouldn't be able to go play with my friends anymore because I kept having to pee.

977
01:00:29,132 --> 01:00:30,759
Scott: Just go play in the pool and pee.

978
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,944
Rym: Yeah, that might have worked.

979
01:00:32,386 --> 01:00:33,872
Rym: I didn't think about that I didn't.

980
01:00:33,952 --> 01:00:35,236
Scott: I was playing the ocean and pee.

981
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:38,949
Rym: kid brain couldn't figure out that I should just go stay in the pool all day.

982
01:00:40,192 --> 01:00:43,190
Rym: Kid brain just kept crying and going back into the bathroom and peeing.

983
01:00:44,393 --> 01:00:45,265
Scott: Bring a big ring game boy.

984
01:00:45,285 --> 01:00:45,386
Scott: Yeah.

985
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:53,790
Rym: But I think actually if I have to say my favorite fruit It is not as easy to eat as say strawberries peaches seedless grapes.

986
01:00:54,392 --> 01:00:57,483
Rym: But the mango mangoes good.

987
01:00:57,503 --> 01:00:58,426
Rym: I love the mango.

988
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,470
Rym: I'll just eat mangoes all day.

989
01:01:00,411 --> 01:01:05,730
Rym: Mmm, the problem is the best mangoes are the ones you get right off a tree in a tropical place.

990
01:01:06,254 --> 01:01:07,244
Rym: we don't have access to those.

991
01:01:07,627 --> 01:01:09,879
Rym: or For the grocery store by us.

992
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:12,090
Rym: every now and then they'll have champagne mangoes.

993
01:01:12,992 --> 01:01:13,838
Rym: They're really good.

994
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,228
Rym: They rot instantly.

995
01:01:16,432 --> 01:01:17,518
Rym: It's not like ripe.

996
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:24,789
Rym: It's not like rock ripe a badge Like if they're in the grocery store, they're always ripe and they will be bad by the end of that day.

997
01:01:25,552 --> 01:01:30,950
Rym: So if you ever see champagne mangoes in the grocery store, just buy them and eat them all that night.

998
01:01:31,452 --> 01:01:33,664
Scott: It's hard for me to have a favorite fruit because it's like.

999
01:01:33,684 --> 01:01:38,082
Scott: there's so many delicious fruits I love whichever one is in season and high quality, right?

1000
01:01:38,122 --> 01:01:40,230
Scott: It's like I'm not you know, it's like I love fucking Apple.

1001
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:41,058
Scott: It's Apple season.

1002
01:01:41,078 --> 01:01:42,370
Scott: I'm like, yeah, give me all the Apple.

1003
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:52,148
Scott: But then it's like, you know if I'm sitting there in the summer and it's like, okay Here's an apple and then here is you know an in-season like fucking strawberry.

1004
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:52,730
Scott: That's perfect.

1005
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:54,300
Scott: It's like oh, I don't want the fucking Apple.

1006
01:01:54,522 --> 01:01:55,750
Rym: That is one thing I took with fruit.

1007
01:01:55,870 --> 01:02:01,030
Rym: I tend to eat seasonally and I tend to avoid out of season fruit, even though I could get them.

1008
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,198
Rym: I live in New York and get any fruit.

1009
01:02:02,238 --> 01:02:07,930
Rym: I want just about if you spend money Yeah, but even then like I tend to like to eat the things that are most in season.

1010
01:02:08,031 --> 01:02:11,650
Rym: So like when it's blackberry season, I'm just eating blackberries in the winter.

1011
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,617
Rym: I'm eating whatever fruits you can get in the winter.

1012
01:02:13,899 --> 01:02:14,400
Scott: Another fruit.

1013
01:02:14,461 --> 01:02:16,348
Scott: I don't like is the cherry, right?

1014
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,734
Rym: So I love wrong with you cherries are great.

1015
01:02:19,276 --> 01:02:20,158
Rym: Every cherry is great.

1016
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:21,603
Scott: Yeah, I love cherries.

1017
01:02:21,623 --> 01:02:22,906
Rym: I like sour cherries.

1018
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:24,250
Rym: I like black cherries.

1019
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:29,230
Scott: You know cherry the red the red cherry that they put on like ice cream sundae that's discuss.

1020
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:29,915
Scott: Those are so good.

1021
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:30,680
Scott: Those are the words put.

1022
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,270
Rym: those think I just gotta get the good ones.

1023
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:33,725
Rym: The fancy one the looks right.

1024
01:02:33,806 --> 01:02:37,617
Scott: then It's like but cherry flavored stuff is great.

1025
01:02:38,118 --> 01:02:42,590
Scott: Right cherry like juice on stuff or like in stuff like a cherry pie.

1026
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:43,232
Scott: That's great.

1027
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:44,656
Scott: I could eat that right?

1028
01:02:44,696 --> 01:02:45,298
Scott: No problem.

1029
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:47,645
Rym: That's got your head the Luxardo cherry.

1030
01:02:47,886 --> 01:02:49,230
Scott: No, but maybe it's good.

1031
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:50,657
Scott: I don't know the Luxardo cherry.

1032
01:02:50,677 --> 01:02:52,806
Rym: It's basically like that's black cherry.

1033
01:02:52,867 --> 01:02:53,289
Scott: I can eat.

1034
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,219
Scott: right We're talking about the red ones are the ones that I can't do.

1035
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,183
Rym: why they're so good.

1036
01:02:57,564 --> 01:03:07,469
Scott: and it's like I can do them Pretty much in any form except I can't just eat them directly Right, so it's like even a red cherry, which I know I love the black cherry in all forms, right?

1037
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:11,589
Scott: But the red cherry if you put it into some other form I can eat it.

1038
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:17,973
Scott: But if it's just sit in there like a Mario fucking - right where it's just like - little I'll eat those all day Right, just like.

1039
01:03:17,993 --> 01:03:19,219
Scott: um, I can't eat that.

1040
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:19,722
Scott: Why not?

1041
01:03:19,943 --> 01:03:20,526
Scott: No, I can't eat like.

1042
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:21,370
Rym: what don't you like about him?

1043
01:03:21,671 --> 01:03:22,614
Scott: I'm just no good.

1044
01:03:22,815 --> 01:03:23,718
Rym: What's not good about them.

1045
01:03:23,818 --> 01:03:26,930
Rym: I just I don't know like you can't articulate the specific thing that bothers you.

1046
01:03:27,331 --> 01:03:28,938
Rym: No, that's okay.

1047
01:03:28,958 --> 01:03:36,570
Rym: I just don't like weird why I'd like, okay I'll give you a Luxardo cherry and you can try one of them.

1048
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:37,602
Scott: I mean that looks like a black cherries.

1049
01:03:37,663 --> 01:03:38,189
Scott: I probably love it.

1050
01:03:38,411 --> 01:03:39,013
Rym: Yeah, but they're.

1051
01:03:39,254 --> 01:03:40,460
Rym: they're soaked in the sweet like.

1052
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,650
Rym: they're basically like the cherries you'd put on a Sunday.

1053
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:44,936
Rym: They're just the fancy version of that.

1054
01:03:45,177 --> 01:03:47,102
Rym: Okay, they're not it's only.

1055
01:03:47,142 --> 01:03:51,994
Scott: the only ones I don't like are the red ones in their Unprocessed form.

1056
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:57,349
Rym: No, I do really like pomegranates But they're too much of a pain in the ass.

1057
01:03:58,091 --> 01:03:59,176
Scott: Yeah, I do pomegranate.

1058
01:03:59,196 --> 01:04:02,150
Scott: when someone else does the pain in the ass someone else does the pomegranating.

1059
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:06,306
Rym: I will eat the pomegranates, but I'm not willing to do the pomegranating myself anymore.

1060
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:09,241
Rym: Yeah Prickly pear is the same deal like.

1061
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:13,930
Rym: I'll just eat prickly pear But someone else has to make it for me and no one is willing to do that.

1062
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:17,545
Scott: Another fruit that I don't like that everyone else seems to love is the lychee.

1063
01:04:17,846 --> 01:04:18,710
Rym: Lychee is delicious.

1064
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,463
Rym: It's got someone just brought up the lychee in the forum in the live stream.

1065
01:04:22,744 --> 01:04:24,069
Scott: Oh interesting like she's really good.

1066
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,110
Scott: Everyone else seems to love lychee, but I'm not into it.

1067
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:29,964
Rym: The thing is the lychee is one of those fruits kind of like pear.

1068
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:31,170
Scott: It tastes too much like a flower.

1069
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:33,939
Scott: I love you like to eat flowers.

1070
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:34,822
