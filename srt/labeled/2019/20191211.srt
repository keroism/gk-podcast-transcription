00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:17,026
Scott: Yeah, at least DC right.

00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:05,319
Scott: They come out of the sky.

30
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:13,426
Scott: No, they stop at the same place because the bus just the bus stop is literally in front of the Amtrak train station All right in New York.

31
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:13,727
Rym: Where is?

00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:38,860
Scott: Anyway, so On the way in right it's like I don't know where the hell any thing fucking is in Philadelphia Which is weird to me and what I know or anything is there.

38
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,807
Rym: I was making funny afford at the con partly cuz.

39
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:47,912
Rym: like I don't know a lot about like every city on earth But any place I go I have a vague idea of the geography.

40
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:51,589
Rym: Like I know generally what I know the local West I know uptown and down.

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,580
Rym: So I know around no I'm talking like Philly There's Center City like to order away from Center City.

45
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,123
Rym: Like you don't like.

46
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:11,114
Rym: I know the not know anything about that like Boston.

47
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:12,280
Rym: I know where Southie is Like.

48
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:14,147
Rym: I know like I imagine it's.

49
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:15,271
Scott: I imagine it's south.

50
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:16,957
Rym: That's actually where PAX East is.

51
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:22,354
Scott: Okay Well, anyway, I you know, I know where I walk rights like in Seattle.

52
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,320
Scott: I walked over like most of Seattle.

53
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,758
Scott: That's why I know my way her and I've done it so many times.

54
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:32,508
Scott: I haven't gone up that hill right and I've ridden the light rail Which I can see out the window and that sort of.

55
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:36,000
Scott: let me know right know the general relation of some things.

56
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,080
Scott: Yeah, right in Seattle, but like Philly, you know, it's like alright.

57
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,286
Scott: Well, I know there's the train station and I know where things are around the convention center But I don't know.

58
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:53,506
Scott: in between is like black empty space It's like it's like a RTS and it's all black right train station always out of town I don't know.

59
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:56,520
Scott: Anyway, all I know is where I've walked and removed the fog of war.

60
00:03:57,162 --> 00:04:01,760
Rym: How do you I don't know how you go to a city and not know like basic things about that city.

61
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:14,620
Scott: But anyway, so yeah like Rym was saying he made fun of me because I used a cab to go from the train to the Con when there is both to navigate the fog of war zone when there is but one quickly and with low effort.

62
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:26,160
Rym: There is a subway line that goes from the train station to the convention Connected to our hotel and there's a trolley line that runs like every three minutes that also goes between those two places.

63
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:27,320
Scott: He made fun of me for that.

64
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:32,855
Scott: So on the way home We go down into the subway or trolley or whatever the hell down into whatever.

65
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:36,552
Scott: we used it to get to the train station that Night, all right, and we looking around and I'm like, all right.

66
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:37,860
Scott: I would try to figure it out.

67
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:38,984
Rym: All right, you buy a ticket.

68
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:40,792
Scott: so we go to the ticket machine.

69
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,520
Scott: Yeah, you take a machine has two options.

70
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:45,059
Scott: Yeah, we push the option on the left.

71
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:47,090
Scott: It does not none of these choices out.

72
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,015
Scott: there were three choices.

73
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:51,180
Scott: after pushing that one None of them were to buy an individual ride.

74
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,720
Scott: The cheapest one was a full day pass for $6 and I'm like that is not right.

75
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,128
Scott: So I chose the one on the right one.

76
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:59,857
Scott: that was for refilling some kind of other pass.

77
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:00,860
Rym: just get a pass.

78
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,750
Rym: That's like a metro card.

79
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:02,357
Rym: It just works.

80
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,784
Rym: The screen were to get a single ride pass.

81
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,575
Scott: They were all more than the two.

82
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:10,059
Scott: so one.

83
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:16,360
Rym: There are different machines that are aimed at tourists that sell the single ride like magnetic stripe.

84
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,943
Scott: There's only one kind of machine in that Back.

85
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,807
Rym: that is not true.

86
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:25,100
Scott: Well in the why had this first one there were only one kind of machine.

87
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,748
Rym: I have bought single rides there.

88
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:29,160
Scott: in the spot that we were there was only one kind of.

89
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:35,158
Rym: Same went into Grand Central went to a random like Metro card only machine and couldn't figure out how to buy a ticket.

90
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,190
Scott: then Went to right.

91
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,680
Scott: Amanda had the same problem, too.

92
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,905
Scott: we could not figure out.

93
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:45,678
Rym: just bought the Philly equivalent of a metro card and put like a Dollar or two on it and would have been good to go.

94
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:54,219
Scott: That is that was not clear how to do this and not without buying a. the only option I could find that was not a zillion Way too expensive using six dollar day.

95
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,060
Rym: But you are never allowed to make fun of tourists having trouble with the metro.

96
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:58,485
Scott: Figure it out either.

97
00:05:58,506 --> 00:05:59,369
Scott: Why are you making fun of me?

98
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,092
Scott: Like I'm stupid.

99
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:02,160
Scott: I'm pointing I'm saying is I'm saying this was not hard?

100
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,080
Scott: And I know I'm saying we are not stupid.

101
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:07,017
Scott: I'm saying the Philly system is as awful as I said, it was.

102
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:07,319
Scott: I'm right.

103
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,048
Rym: I'm saying I use those same machines.

104
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,440
Scott: are you saying a man is stupid also, she couldn't figure it out?

105
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,108
Rym: You two definitely have a problem with.

106
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:15,720
Scott: you couldn't figure out how to buy a single ride ticket.

107
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,010
Scott: We could not figure out which side of the map was on.

108
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,775
Scott: the wall was like some partial map.

109
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:22,862
Scott: that didn't show like a map Of the city.

110
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:28,985
Scott: it just showed like a line and some dots and it didn't say which one we were at or we couldn't tell Which one's got all over.

111
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:32,116
Scott: that we couldn't show which direction was east or west we couldn't.

112
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:34,560
Scott: it says on the platform We looked on the platform.

113
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,720
Scott: We couldn't tell which side of the platform was going east or west or whether we should be going east or west or what kind?

114
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:40,980
Scott: Of train was coming to that guy.

115
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:44,180
Rym: All I'm saying is you sound like a tourist and I don't know why you had all these problems.

116
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,947
Scott: I'm saying that the system was garbage.

117
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:49,200
Rym: We used the subway to get it to get back and forth.

118
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,800
Rym: We also use the subway to go to the restaurant which was east in the other side of the city.

119
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:58,877
Rym: Well, and then we took it from there back to the hotel and then back to the train station.

120
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:03,112
Scott: the Philly Public transit is great garbage and has awful design.

121
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:09,074
Rym: All right, uh, I Don't understand how you had these problems because I use the exact.

122
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:10,560
Scott: Amanda had also had these problems.

123
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:16,538
Scott: So when there are also other people coming in who also couldn't figure out what the fuck to do and they had a booth with No one in it to ask for help

124
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:22,761
Rym: Okay, so I you are never allowed to make fun of people in New York having trouble with the Metro cards machine That

125
00:07:22,782 --> 00:07:25,720
Scott: your card is very well designed and has no problems.

126
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:27,467
Rym: I think they're equal.

127
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:30,017
Rym: And in fact, actually the Philly system is pretty easier to use.

128
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:32,375
Scott: Yeah, okay I'll go next time I go down there.

129
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:32,900
Scott: I'll take a video.

130
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,495
Scott: I'll make a video comparison of the Metro card machine versus whatever fucking machine they had down there.

131
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:41,105
Scott: Okay, Metro card machine It's like by Metro card.

132
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,634
Scott: one ride boom done.

133
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:46,585
Scott: There was no one Got.

134
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:50,389
Rym: you realize New York is phasing out the one Ride and they charge a premium for that.

135
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,660
Rym: it cost more than buying a normal Metro card and filling up.

136
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,255
Scott: I was taking one ride for the whole year.

137
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:56,442
Scott: I want to pay 275.

138
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,690
Scott: There was no to seven.

139
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,736
Scott: That was what was promised.

140
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,751
Scott: one ride 275 there was no option on that screen.

141
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,077
Scott: got for a single 275 ride.

142
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,342
Rym: You realize New York.

143
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,435
Scott: anyway, I navigated every menu on the device.

144
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:11,200
Rym: not you realize in New York You have to pay an extra dollar to get a Metro card.

145
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:13,068
Scott: Yeah, well, that's a different thing.

146
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,660
Scott: But the point is there was the same way in Philly.

147
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,891
Rym: You could have just spent the extra.

148
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:16,920
Rym: it's like a dollar 20.

149
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,831
Rym: There is no time the equivalent of a measure.

150
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,558
Scott: No, I navigated every menu.

151
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:22,973
Scott: There was not option.

152
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,834
Rym: My wallet that I bought from one of those machines.

153
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:28,799
Rym: like three years ago.

154
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,900
Scott: There was no option on that men in any menu on that machine to buy one ride and Scott.

155
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,807
Rym: Well, like I said the one ride.

156
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,573
Rym: machines that sell a paper ticket.

157
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:39,100
Rym: Those are only used by tourists.

158
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:40,645
Rym: That's an item part of the station.

159
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:41,847
Rym: I've used them.

160
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:42,350
Rym: They're.

161
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,700
Scott: there's also no option to buy a card with one ride on it.

162
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,226
Rym: Uh, yeah, there is.

163
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:50,220
Scott: I did so and also see that you have the card.

164
00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:54,468
Scott: But I'm telling you two intelligent people tried to use this machine.

165
00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:01,393
Scott: even if it was possible to get that card from the machine the Design of the machine and the design of the system was to blame.

166
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:03,020
Scott: we could not figure it out.

167
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,224
Rym: I think that's really funny.

168
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,712
Rym: I don't understand what your problem was.

169
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:09,380
Scott: I think it is an awful garbage public transit system.

170
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,028
Scott: So we had plenty of time so we walked.

171
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:11,490
Rym: All right.

172
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,720
Rym: I think the Philly transit system is great.

173
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,640
Scott: I think it's I think it's trash and their whole city's trash burn it down.

174
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,340
Scott: But they seem to do that on purpose so I don't have to really encourage them.

175
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,080
Rym: I would say that Philly probably has the third best transit system in America.

176
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,131
Scott: I mean that's like saying oh the third least smelly tire.

177
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:33,960
Scott: I would also say that Philly's Even the New York subway, which is great is garbage compared to actual transit in other countries.

178
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,937
Scott: But I'm saying so if you're third best that's like wow, you're worse than the garbage.

179
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:38,740
Scott: That's tolerable.

180
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,502
Rym: I'm also saying that Philly's is better than Boston's and it's way better than DC says equal to Boston's Probably.

181
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,386
Rym: what if you ever use?

182
00:09:45,447 --> 00:09:48,360
Scott: Boston sucks ass it does and Philly also sucks ass.

183
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:52,187
Rym: Well, maybe if you couldn't figure it out for some reason I can't figure out fucking the tea either.

184
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:54,678
Scott: you go down there try to buy a Charlie card and it's like the machines.

185
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:55,100
Scott: don't spit.

186
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:56,008
Scott: You can't even find me.

187
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:57,319
Rym: I've never had a problem like that.

188
00:09:58,061 --> 00:09:59,768
Scott: I've had the same problems in Boston.

189
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:01,555
Scott: You like try to get a charlie card stations.

190
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:04,262
Scott: Don't have a machine Scott.

191
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,149
Rym: I've used the tea a bunch of times.

192
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,213
Rym: That's not a problem.

193
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:07,916
Scott: I have used it.

194
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:11,033
Rym: I've used it with you Yeah, and I've had no problems with it.

195
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:12,080
Scott: It's bad sucks.

196
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:21,300
Rym: The only problems with the Boston tea is that doesn't go anywhere that I want to go and that transferring between lines is Usually like a 40 mile walk in an underground tunnel.

197
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:24,555
Rym: But other than those two problems the machines the ticketing that all works fine.

198
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:25,620
Scott: It also doesn't run late.

199
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:28,514
Rym: Yeah, Philly's does so again.

200
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:30,003
Rym: Philly better I don't?

201
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:32,494
Scott: you said the thing comes every three minutes the whole time.

202
00:10:32,534 --> 00:10:33,860
Scott: with this Scott many minutes.

203
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,379
Scott: We were down there trying to figure it out.

204
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,704
Scott: That sounds like you came.

205
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:41,360
Rym: that's because you went to the fucking subway that runs every 11 minutes as opposed to the trolley.

206
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:44,800
Rym: That's on another track right there that runs every three or four minutes.

207
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:47,520
Scott: We could not tell where the difference between a trolley or a subway.

208
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,388
Rym: We could have looked at one of the many maps.

209
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:52,440
Scott: the labeling of the system and the maps were so awful.

210
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,360
Scott: They were incomprehensible.

211
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:56,551
Rym: I'd say they're actually easier to read than the New York ones there were.

212
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:59,564
Rym: and we're just blinded by the fact that you've studied the New York one a lot.

213
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:00,953
Rym: I guess you can't use a subway.

214
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:01,839
Scott: What is much more?

215
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,360
Scott: Comprehensible and well-designed in its typography and maps.

216
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:13,236
Scott: You never see like a map in the New York City subway that just shows a yellow line For the end and doesn't actually have a picture of New York behind it.

217
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:17,676
Rym: Yeah, Scott That's what's in the actual subway cars that strip at the top.

218
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:18,620
Rym: that just shows the last.

219
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,326
Scott: I'm saying before I even get on.

220
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:21,652
Scott: imagine if that's all you saw.

221
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:22,274
Rym: Yeah Scott.

222
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,820
Rym: There are just normal maps.

223
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,350
Scott: It's usually not already on the trains got.

224
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,635
Rym: there's normal maps.

225
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:28,559
Rym: No design anyone.

226
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:36,059
Scott: Well again, I know for a fact they're there and I think we saw did not even indicate which station we were at.

227
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:41,233
Rym: Okay, that was on like every sign when you go in.

228
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:41,715
Rym: All right.

229
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:44,768
Scott: Well next time we go there Well, let's go in for a next unplug.

230
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,338
Scott: We'll go down into a little subway and you can explain it to me.

231
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:47,780
Rym: Okay?

232
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,407
Rym: I was not too intelligent.

233
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:50,814
Rym: adults could not figure it out.

234
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:51,900
Rym: It is not me.

235
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:55,012
Rym: I will gladly teach you how to ride subways.

236
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:56,257
Rym: That is what you're asking me to do.

237
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:57,100
Scott: I know how to ride subways.

238
00:11:57,261 --> 00:12:03,691
Scott: I just don't know where the fuck I'm going or how the hell the Philly subway is designed because it's designed By a crazy person.

239
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:10,300
Rym: All I'm gonna say is one I think you just only know how to ride the New York transit system and literally can't deal with it anywhere else on earth.

240
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:14,394
Scott: I think that other places on earth are just really shitty - I think I blame the system.

241
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:15,197
Scott: I don't blame the rider.

242
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:22,732
Rym: I Can't wait to see you try to ride the Tokyo subway I'm sure it'll show or the Paris underground.

243
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:24,480
Rym: I've seen the London underground.

244
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:29,780
Scott: I've seen signs in Tokyo and I know that the train also has words in English, so I should be able to ride it.

245
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,420
Rym: Yeah I don't think you're gonna be able to buy a ticket because the Tokyo system is not as well documented in like outside.

246
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:38,347
Rym: It kind of assumes, you know more about it.

247
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:41,379
Rym: The Philly one has a whole bunch of signs and things to help you everywhere.

248
00:12:42,802 --> 00:12:44,440
Scott: Everyone did not have helpful signs.

249
00:12:45,103 --> 00:12:48,940
Rym: Feel like I need to go down there and make like a POV video of like.

250
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:51,089
Rym: Oh, look another map of the subway station.

251
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:51,752
Rym: Let's walk.

252
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,640
Rym:  oh look another map of the subway station.

253
00:12:54,681 --> 00:13:00,080
Rym: Also, you could have just asked Google if you'd put in Google.

254
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:05,162
Scott: We looked at Google and it was not helpful because Google told us, you know It was like.

255
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,270
Scott: oh take any of these green numbers.

256
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,093
Scott: Yeah, right.

257
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:09,880
Rym: They all stop it with the same platform.

258
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:10,812
Rym: That was early.

259
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:11,480
Rym: no numbers.

260
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,060
Scott: They're at the platform to tell us that these numbers are showing up in this place or which direction I'm going.

261
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,269
Scott: We were in a green place.

262
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:17,893
Scott: It's like, okay.

263
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:18,377
Scott: No you guys.

264
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,234
Rym: No You weren't because what you fucking said that you said you waited that long.

265
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:24,740
Rym: you were waiting for the MFL.

266
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:25,988
Rym: You are not waiting for the trolley.

267
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,900
Rym: You were in a different part of the subway station.

268
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:31,400
Scott: There was no explanation of how are you supposed to know what we were waiting for?

269
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:33,229
Scott: Google Maps said MFL on it.

270
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,785
Scott: the letters MFL did not appear in the station We were in.

271
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:37,319
Scott: that is why we could not match up.

272
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,265
Scott: Well Google Maps said with what the fuck was going on because the things that were labeled on Google Maps were not labels that Appeared anywhere in the station.

273
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:47,840
Rym: as Google Maps says like go to this platform get on the train that says it's going here.

274
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,905
Rym: It arrives at this time.

275
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:50,692
Rym: Does your Apple Google Maps not do that?

276
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:52,400
Scott: That is not what we saw on Google Maps.

277
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:53,564
Rym: Is your does your?

278
00:13:53,584 --> 00:14:00,027
Scott: Google Maps had a list of a strip with several numbers and it said yeah One of these numbers there were.

279
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,554
Scott: none of those numbers appeared in the station.

280
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:02,740
Rym: Scott, New York.

281
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:06,020
Rym: The four five and six all go to crazy fucking different place.

282
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,900
Scott: Yeah, but if you go in the station the station says four five six on it.

283
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:18,440
Scott: This is like if I looked at Google Maps and it said four five six and I went up to the station and all it Said was Lexington Avenue and didn't actually say four five or six on the station.

284
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:20,720
Scott: Well, how do I fucking know if a four five or six station?

285
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,720
Rym: I think you just hate mass transit in her bed.

286
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:33,588
Scott: Imagine if I removed all of the colored numbers and letters from the M from Metro from the subway Only I. But yet on Google Maps there were.

287
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:44,089
Rym: yeah when you search for things that would be the colored circles I'm all I'm saying is I was able to and for three years in a row go to Philly Go down into that subway buy a ticket.

288
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:45,454
Scott: Congratulations.

289
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:46,698
Scott: We were not right.

290
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:47,480
Scott: We are not stupid.

291
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,524
Scott: The system is garbage.

292
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:52,760
Scott: just cuz you can successfully navigate a garbage system doesn't make it not a garbage system.

293
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,447
Rym: I think you can't navigate subways.

294
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,896
Rym: I think you can only navigate the New York City subway.

295
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:02,457
Rym: Yeah, okay Okay, I you have said things that are objectively not true about that station.

296
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:04,163
Scott: They are extremely Station.

297
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:05,711
Scott: that how come Amanda couldn't do it either.

298
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,420
Scott: Are you calling Amanda stupid as me?

299
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,566
Rym: You both had a problem with.

300
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:09,873
Scott: are you saying that she is stupid?

301
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:11,000
Rym: I didn't say anyone's stupid.

302
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:11,687
Rym: I'm saying uh-huh.

303
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,080
Scott: That seems to be what you're saying.

304
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,508
Scott: Oh, you know, we must be stupid.

305
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,460
Scott: if either were stupid or the system is broken.

306
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,644
Scott: You can't be on one of the other.

307
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:20,514
Rym: I think you had some problem.

308
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:22,060
Rym: That is not coming to everyone else.

309
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:22,703
Scott: That.

310
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:25,460
Scott: meanwhile other people in the station were all equally confused.

311
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:28,985
Rym: I just tourists cuz I see Many people come.

312
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:32,800
Scott: anyone else in that station was also confusing couldn't figure out how to use that machine.

313
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,185
Rym: They were probably all tourists like you.

314
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,057
Rym: I see thousands of confused people in the New York subway every day.

315
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:38,544
Rym: They're all tourists Mm-hmm.

316
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,380
Rym: I think you were just a tourist and you couldn't use the subway.

317
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:44,320
Scott: Yeah, if they removed all the letters and numbers from the stations.

318
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:46,240
Scott: But those letters and numbers appeared on Google Maps.

319
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:48,139
Scott: How the fuck would you know if you're in a six station?

320
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,280
Rym: Because it says all over the place what the station is, right?

321
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,606
Scott: But imagine if it all didn't.

322
00:15:52,707 --> 00:15:56,726
Scott: you looked at Google Maps and said take the six and when you go to the station There are no sixes anywhere.

323
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:58,997
Scott: How do you know that you're in the fucking six station?

324
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:06,159
Scott: I mean, yes I know the six is coming here Yes in a made-up situation where there weren't exactly what happened in the Philly subway where Google said all these numbers on it.

325
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:09,280
Scott: take one Of these numbered trains and none of those numbers are on the station anywhere.

326
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:14,709
Scott: So, I don't know if I'm in the fucking right station All right and Google Maps didn't say to go east or west.

327
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:15,492
Scott: so I couldn't tell.

328
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:19,980
Scott: and I couldn't tell if I was in the east or West side of the track because it was so mislabeled Scott.

329
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:23,572
Rym: You didn't know which direction was east or west down there.

330
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:25,360
Rym: It was on labeled.

331
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:26,629
Scott: It did not say this.

332
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,200
Scott: it like in New York City subway you go down.

333
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,670
Scott: It says this is uptown track.

334
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:31,120
Scott: other side is downtown track.

335
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:35,877
Scott: There was no such label in the station telling you which side of the track was upward downtown.

336
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:39,708
Rym: god or Easter I'm gonna say is those signs are definitely there signs.

337
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,250
Scott: We're not there.

338
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:40,952
Scott: I looked all over.

339
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:41,914
Scott: Okay.

340
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:48,042
Rym: Anyway in anime news So studio trigger is Coming out.

341
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:50,993
Rym: They've announced like right away right on the heels of promare.

342
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:52,680
Rym: We don't know a lot of details yet.

343
00:16:53,261 --> 00:17:00,080
Rym: I think they did the initial announcement anime Expo, but there's gonna be a new trigger anime called BNA.

344
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:04,220
Scott: I mean they pretty much as continuously make shows one after the other right?

345
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,839
Scott: It feels like almost they've got like a parallel processing going on.

346
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:20,176
Scott: We're like they make a movie and they got like a team on a movie and a team on a show and when when the shows Coming out they're working on the next thing and like this is like a constant production going on Which is I guess how you have to overwork people to make money.

347
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:22,170
Scott: in anime He's just constantly things out.

348
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:26,339
Scott: if you have a gap where you're not putting anything out You're not making any money to pay anyone during that time, right?

349
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,262
Rym: So here's what we know.

350
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:30,475
Rym: it is called BNA which stands for a brand new animal.

Rym: Yeah, it looks like there's a cute.

356
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:39,020
Rym: Maybe she's a raccoon girl.

357
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:39,667
Rym: I can't quite tell.

358
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:40,838
Rym: there's some sort of wolf guy.

359
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:44,009
Rym: Looks like they're putting their good people on it.

360
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,515
Scott: I mean all their people are good people.

361
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:46,580
Scott: so they have bad people.

362
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:51,812
Rym: So, let's see They list a whole bunch of people who are any bad people that trigger.

363
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:52,977
Rym: I'm sure there are others.

364
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:53,680
Scott: What did they put out?

365
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,255
Scott: That's no good.

366
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,907
Rym: There's got to be like a beat.

367
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:59,260
Scott: I mean some of its better than others, right?

368
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,887
Scott: But like have they put out anything bad?

369
00:18:00,907 --> 00:18:02,494
Rym: No, they definitely have not.

370
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:06,566
Rym: Okay, so So I'm pretty excited about this.

371
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,731
Scott: when's it actually gonna be out?

372
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:09,115
Rym: Uh, let's see.

373
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:10,340
Rym: It's not clear yet.

374
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,466
Rym: Actually, they've just announced that it exists.

375
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:15,255
Rym: It's gonna be on Fuji TV plus ultra in 2020.

376
00:18:15,255 --> 00:18:16,699
Rym: Okay, so you got a while.

377
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,663
Rym: That's all we know.

378
00:18:17,904 --> 00:18:18,265
Scott: No rush.

379
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:20,375
Rym: Uh, so we'll see how this goes.

380
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:22,043
Rym: I'm just assuming it's gonna be great It's not.

381
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,340
Scott: is it based on anything existing or is it completely original?

382
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,166
Rym: I have no idea.

383
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:27,180
Scott: Like is there already a brand new animal manga?

384
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,480
Rym: There are one, two, three, four, five paragraphs on this article two of which are just like one sentence.

385
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:37,399
Scott: I imagine it is then not based on an existing thing because they would have mentioned that existing thing and linked to it.

386
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,766
Rym: Yep, it looks like it's just its own thing.

387
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:41,131
Rym: They have a script writer.

388
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:43,638
Rym: It's the Kellok Hill strip script writer.

389
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:45,103
Scott: Mm-hmm All right.

390
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:49,077
Scott: So this is sort of it's not really a news org.

391
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:52,472
Scott: I guess kind of a geek But I don't know if I can know how to describe what I'm about to talk about.

392
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:54,040
Rym: So you're talking about something.

393
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,600
Scott: Yeah, so there's some nerds in New York City, right?

394
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,272
Scott: Who are like, you know, one of them's even like a like a profess like.

395
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:04,291
Scott: the main person is like a professory Like a manga professor a person who like teaches somewhere.

396
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:12,920
Scott: I don't even know somewhere in the city Like classes like about manga like studying, you know, there's always that professor at college who's teaching all the weird stuff, right?

397
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,020
Scott: Yeah, small class somewhere the thing that they're they're just really interested in it personally and since they're professor they can do classes on it.

398
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,583
Scott: Right, you know what.

399
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:22,220
Scott: you know that everyone who's been to college knows about that professor, right?

400
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:29,860
Scott: So They run this club that I found out about called the manga reading and research network, right?

401
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,382
Scott: So I went.

402
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:32,871
Scott: some of its meetings were literally a block away from here.

403
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:35,060
Scott: There's this place or a recording, right?

404
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,233
Scott: So I went to those meetings in 2017 two years ago.

405
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,573
Scott: They then had a meet a couple meetings in downtown Manhattan.

406
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:44,360
Scott: So I didn't go to those because those are far away.

407
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:50,081
Scott: But then they had another meeting a block away from here suddenly in 2019.

408
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:56,160
Scott: So a club that started in 20 May of 2017 had its last meeting in November 2018.

409
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,305
Scott: So it hasn't met for a year.

410
00:19:57,786 --> 00:20:01,540
Scott: suddenly had a meeting a block away from here again in 2019.

411
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,404
Scott: I thought it was dead, but then I got an email and the reason I went Emily went also is They had.

412
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,790
Scott: it was a special meeting.

413
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:15,714
Scott: Usually most of the other meetings were like Rita manga You know show up and then talk about the manga.

414
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:25,634
Scott: right this meeting They had an actual editor of actual manga whose current job is editor of manga at weekly young magazine, which is not.

415
00:20:25,694 --> 00:20:33,320
Scott: it's not like a You know, it's not a show a show to jump level, but it's like that's the magazine of Kara was in right?

416
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:34,746
Rym: Yeah, I miss this.

417
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:35,450
Rym: It sounds like it was fun.

418
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:37,019
Scott: It's a big-time, you know.

419
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:40,893
Scott: Editor of real current mangas to come and talk to us.

420
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:42,418
Scott: The dude was in New York.

421
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:44,243
Scott: We had.

422
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:45,750
Scott: we submitted questions.

423
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,060
Scott: they asked him the questions he asked us questions.

424
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:49,848
Scott: It was a good time.

425
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:51,238
Scott: I learned a lot of interesting stuff.

426
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:53,570
Scott: We saw some interesting mangas.

427
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:55,500
Scott: We didn't know about that are in that magazine.

428
00:20:56,861 --> 00:21:06,799
Scott: I read there was a sampler for this one called starving anonymous, which is sort of in that horror terrible secret of a space genre.

429
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:19,583
Scott: And then he talked about one that he's editing also which is it's like witch and beast I think is what it's called and it's sort of like a beauty and beast reversal.

430
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:22,656
Scott: where is this girl who's the beast?

431
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:33,420
Scott: and she's trying to Kill all the witches and each which has like a different magic power of some kind You know, but I guess it's it's probably still has some fighting tournament aspects to it, right?

432
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,614
Scott: You know go to the next witch kind of deal.

433
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:39,556
Scott: Yeah, right but yeah, it was interesting time.

434
00:21:39,576 --> 00:21:46,906
Scott: and So if you're in New York, you should you know, see if this thing ever meets again, maybe next year It'll have a meeting.

435
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:47,533
Scott: who knows right?

436
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:48,058
Scott: You never know.

437
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:49,728
Scott: And show up to it.

438
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:51,180
Scott: Oh, yes, you know this.

439
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:54,745
Rym: I mean if I wasn't like in Asia on this like big work trip I definitely would have got.

440
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:57,440
Scott: you know, a bunch of weebs will show up and you can learn about some mangas.

441
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:59,046
Rym: I actually was in London during this.

442
00:21:59,448 --> 00:21:59,990
Rym: I don't know.

443
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,612
Rym: I was somewhere.

444
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,539
Scott: I don't know if this ever happens again.

445
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:04,556
Scott: Show up come on show up.

446
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:14,776
Scott: And Otherwise it gave us the show idea for today because the guy was asking about you know how to distribute mangas digitally, so

447
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:22,359
Rym: Yep, the well, we'll get you to the main bit because the alternative was I wanted to review Beavis and Butthead But Scott doesn't remember it that well

448
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:24,649
Scott: I haven't seen a Beavis and Butthead since.

449
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,380
Scott: I mean, I can't remember when I saw that's how long ago.

450
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:33,700
Rym: I feel like we will need to Watch more Beavis and I'm pretty sure you've seen all of it repeatedly.

451
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:36,213
Rym: I watched it like on TV from the beginning.

452
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:37,440
Rym: I was probably too young.

453
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,891
Scott: I've watched episodes here and there definitely not even all of it.

454
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:43,660
Rym: Like the family would sit around and watch Beavis and Butthead.

455
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,668
Scott: Yeah, no, we did not do that.

456
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:47,476
Rym: I saw the Beavis and Butthead movie in the theater.

457
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:48,199
Rym: That movie is phenomenal.

458
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:49,259
Scott: I did not do that.

459
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:55,600
Rym: I feel like we should at least you should watch the movie at some point like this year next year because I got better movies.

460
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,714
Rym: Beavis and Butthead movie is an underrated film.

461
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:02,360
Rym: It is really funny.

462
00:23:02,702 --> 00:23:04,169
Scott: It's a solid poop and not a diary.

463
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:04,551
Rym: Oh, it's.

464
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:08,479
Rym: no I would say that it is a standout solid movie.

465
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:10,186
Scott: It's a godfather.

466
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:12,560
Scott: Watch out my godfather Beavis and Butthead movies coming.

467
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:14,820
Rym: It's the godfather of Beavis and Butthead movie.

468
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,107
Rym: like if you take all the content of Beavis and Butthead.

469
00:23:17,588 --> 00:23:24,444
Rym: the Beavis and Butthead movie is like the height of what that could be and It is laugh out loud Hilarious, uh-huh.

470
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:27,860
Rym: Also that quote that never gonna score thing that we play to the hockey game.

471
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,928
Scott: I know that that is from them.

472
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:29,816
Rym: It is from that movie.

473
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:30,320
Scott: I am aware.

474
00:23:31,063 --> 00:23:40,386
Rym: So, uh in some other brief news at anime cons you know have their artist alleys and I saw a Kind of interesting internet kerfuffle.

475
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:51,520
Rym: because the problem with artist alleys at anime cons as time goes on is that a lot of people make it a Like professional like necessary part of their lives and treat it very seriously.

476
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:54,780
Scott: Well, I think even if it's not a necessary part of your life, right?

477
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:10,180
Rym: There's so many conflicting things going on in an artist alley Originally mostly in comic cons for like like in America like that like a comic-con would have like the person working on spider-man Will like sit there and like sign things for money, right?

478
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,240
Scott: It was and it was also for independent comic creators or people who are just ill it right?

479
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,605
Scott: It's like you could sell your art.

480
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:16,730
Scott: You're an artist right?

481
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,160
Scott: Your name is on comic books or whatever, right?

482
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:32,460
Scott: but you're not at a you know, Exhibitor booth right, you know that like at a comic-con the the expo floor Wouldn't be where artists would sit right, you know and do you know commissions and that sort of thing.

483
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,170
Scott: It would be where people were selling comics, right?

484
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,720
Scott: It was like mostly merch booths collector booths, right?

485
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,764
Scott: That sort of thing right.

486
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:48,480
Scott: and then the actual artist was sitting the artists alley So anime cons which spawned from comic cons had artists alley, but it wasn't full of actual anime artists.

487
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:49,223
Scott: Yeah, right.

488
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:50,709
Scott: It was full of fan artists.

489
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:53,320
Scott: So you got the fan art issue going on, right?

490
00:24:54,323 --> 00:25:05,405
Scott: But you've also got the issue these days and that The there's so many fan artists and the anime cons, you know, even though they're past their highest of heydays They're still huge.

491
00:25:05,847 --> 00:25:13,099
Scott: and if you have a table in an artist alley whether you do You know are you know depending on your income level you make depend on this money or not?

492
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:15,147
Scott: You can if your art is good.

493
00:25:15,187 --> 00:25:18,220
Scott: You can make a lot of money on an artist alley table.

494
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:28,511
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't cost a lot to get the table and you can sell a lot of merch if you have a table but Most of that merch is technically violating copyrights, right?

495
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:28,732
Scott: Right.

496
00:25:28,772 --> 00:25:29,855
Scott: So there's that's that issue.

497
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:30,376
Scott: There's tax.

498
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:31,560
Rym: people are not paying taxes.

499
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,810
Scott: You could do times we could.

500
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,940
Scott: there's so many topics.

501
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:36,953
Scott: You could do a podcast like.

502
00:25:37,415 --> 00:25:44,183
Scott: I think there are artist alley Podcasts that talk about artists alley issues and you can make an episode a week for like ever and never run out of things To talk about.

503
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:48,780
Scott: yeah, and you like in your news part you could talk about like the next con coming up and what they're doing.

504
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,573
Scott: you know, you could just go forever.

505
00:25:51,057 --> 00:26:04,800
Rym: but so I saw on Twitter like randomly like I saw a bunch of Controversy like oh, but people were referring to pretty much anytime any artist alley does something does right opens or does something weird or changes?

506
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,482
Scott: Anything.

507
00:26:05,502 --> 00:26:16,045
Scott: the people who are going in that artist alley, you know go crazy about it Positively or negatively because it's a big deal because you know for the people going to the con They don't even know this is happening.

508
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:20,000
Scott: Yeah, but for the people who are in that alley a lot of money is at stake.

509
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:25,740
Scott: Yeah Whether they get or don't get a table and the rules around what they can sell and all those yelps

510
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,643
Rym: But meanwhile huge

511
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:27,866
Scott: deals for those people

512
00:26:27,947 --> 00:26:39,080
Rym: companies like real vendors like like the people who are like selling like legit Goods that aren't in an artist alley They don't have any of these hassles because they just like have a contract relationship with the convention.

513
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:45,093
Scott: The difference is is that you know The if you're if you want to be a dealer at an anime con you just pay.

514
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:46,458
Scott: just buy a dealer booth.

515
00:26:46,478 --> 00:26:51,160
Scott: you buy Expo space by the foot from their grid of space and they're happy to sell it to you.

516
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,373
Rym: Yeah or depending on the gun like I won't share the details of how packs works.

517
00:26:55,474 --> 00:26:56,678
Rym: and also it might have changed because I haven't.

518
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,085
Rym: I Haven't tried to buy Expo Hall space at a PAX in a while But the like.

519
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:07,280
Rym: oftentimes you'll like have a rep who like works with you to fit you in the right spot.

520
00:27:07,661 --> 00:27:09,810
Scott: But I mean the point is that doesn't usually sell out.

521
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:12,100
Scott: and if it does sell out the con raises their rates.

522
00:27:12,502 --> 00:27:15,620
Scott: Right in that area the artist alley to keep it viable.

523
00:27:16,223 --> 00:27:18,956
Scott: Right as a thing because it's definitely a draw for fans.

524
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:19,700
Scott: You don't want to get rid of it.

525
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,400
Scott: It brings Pete by it sells badges.

526
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:24,820
Scott: All right, people would be very upset and not come to your con if you didn't have one

527
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,161
Rym: Yep,

528
00:27:25,782 --> 00:27:27,387
Scott: or if it wasn't any good though

529
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:42,855
Rym: counterpoint having run conventions and seen like the stuff like Not for nothing and I'm not gonna name the con that I'm referring to and it's not the one you might all be thinking of uh Shutting down the artist alley at that con would probably have solved a lot of the problems.

530
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,140
Rym: the kind of head maybe.

531
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:50,440
Scott: but anyway, the point is You're running the con right the artist alley.

532
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,860
Scott: You need to charge a low flat rate for the tables and no one can buy more than one or two tape, right?

533
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,685
Scott: There's like a little right.

534
00:27:56,705 --> 00:27:58,839
Scott: you're either buying a one tabler or a two tabler, right?

535
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,322
Scott: You're not.

536
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:00,089
Scott: you can't like.

537
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:01,340
Scott: let someone make a mega booth in there.

538
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,960
Scott: Otherwise, it's just more expo space, right?

539
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,900
Scott: You have to have a flat rate and you need some other system of decide if the demand to go to those tables is high.

540
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:13,555
Scott: You need some sort of system to distribute the limited supply just like you do it.

541
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:14,960
Scott: badges at a sold-out con.

542
00:28:15,643 --> 00:28:23,740
Scott: Right, you have so many people who want artist alley tables because it's basically you're handing out thousands of dollars but hundreds or thousands of dollars to people.

543
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,150
Scott: Yep, right and exchange for like.

544
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,162
Scott: I don't know what an artist alley table cost these days hundreds Time.

545
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:30,006
Rym: I paid for one.

546
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:31,793
Rym: it was 70 bucks, right?

547
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:32,797
Scott: That's pretty cheap.

548
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:33,460
Scott: I think yeah.

549
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:45,978
Scott: But the point is you're selling these extremely cheap tickets each of which if someone gets one if they have art and merch to Sell which they probably do will you know net them a hot a great profit and more people want them.

550
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:47,268
Scott: then You're right to your choice.

551
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:48,561
Rym: It's just like badges They're.

552
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:56,920
Scott: the supply is way lower than the demand and if you raise the price Well, then people are gonna be super pissed and not buy them because they'll be suit, right?

553
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,687
Scott: It's like yeah, we're not it's just.

554
00:28:58,707 --> 00:28:59,731
Scott: they'll just be more expo Hall.

555
00:28:59,752 --> 00:29:01,760
Scott: then it won't be an artist alley, right?

556
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,219
Scott: So rather than raise the price you got to do a lottery or you got to do a first-come first-serve.

557
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:10,915
Scott: You got to do something right and none of its fair.

558
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:24,280
Scott: and as the con Arguably the random like f5 system is as fair as it's gonna get unless you raise the prices somewhat fair Right, but like the con just wants it to be easy right and to work and to fill their artist alley.

559
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:26,847
Rym: There's a fundamental point.

560
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:30,080
Scott: but the artist people they all want them to get a table funded.

561
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:30,866
Rym: This is the problem.

562
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:31,772
Rym: same with badges.

563
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,463
Rym: no tells at cons artists That was the same thing.

564
00:29:33,784 --> 00:29:37,940
Rym: There is no way to make the artist happy because there is no solution.

565
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:41,551
Rym: You cannot make enough space for all of them.

566
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:47,740
Rym: if you did make enough space So everyone who wants the table got one there'd be so many artists that the artist themselves wouldn't make money.

567
00:29:48,143 --> 00:30:00,500
Rym: I have data from another con again Not the one you might be thinking of where I looked at dealer space and it turned out that When they expanded the dealer room the individual dealers all made a lot less money.

568
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:09,079
Rym: So they actually shrunk the dealer hall kicked out half the dealers and then the dealers who got in made two to three times More money, right?

569
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:18,075
Scott: Cuz even if everyone's selling I mean you could have left you could have had the bigger one and lowered the prices Right, and that would have still netted the convention about the same money.

570
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:18,759
Rym: It's like all right.

571
00:30:19,421 --> 00:30:23,435
Scott: Well, we'll sell more we'll sell more tables for cheaper, right but it's like no.

572
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:25,799
Scott: the dealer needs to make a certain You know, it's like okay.

573
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,578
Scott: Well, the dealers profit margin is the same as like no they need a certain amount of money to cover their flat costs of.

574
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,788
Scott: you Know shipping right?

575
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:34,049
Rym: Yep.

576
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:36,339
Scott: Yeah travel, you know lodging etc.

577
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:48,892
Rym: So I so all you know all these clustering issues not to turn this in the whole show I I basically saw a bunch of people on Twitter referring to the Otakon artist alley Controversy and I expected it to be one of these.

578
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:50,399
Scott: isn't that something that happens just every year?

579
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,465
Rym: Yeah So I expected this there.

580
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:57,280
Rym: I expected something along the lines of all the things we just talked about headlight gone down.

581
00:30:57,884 --> 00:31:15,911
Rym: but then I went and looked into it and The controversy was simply that Otakon made a little puzzle like a flash game And they put it out there and if you solve the puzzle it told you what day the artist alley table like Registration link was going to open and that was it.

582
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:18,120
Rym: That was literally the extent of the controversy.

583
00:31:18,522 --> 00:31:23,389
Scott: So they just they just made an announcement in a cute way Yep, in a way that they thought was cute and fun.

584
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:26,360
Rym: Good fucking God are people outraged about this on the Internet?

585
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:29,640
Rym: Okay, because it trivialized the artist alley.

586
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:30,861
Scott: Okay.

587
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:37,068
Scott: Yep at that that tells reeks to me of someone who just wants to be mad and is looking for a reason to be mad.

588
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:49,540
Rym: I Looked around Twitter like I searched for like Otakon AA and I was looking at the threads and the discourse and I Realized that that that level of reaction seems to be the same literally no matter what happens.

589
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:54,600
Rym: I feel like that's the same amount of discourse that happens just when the date gets announced.

590
00:31:54,781 --> 00:31:56,940
Rym: Anyway, except people are mad about the puzzle.

591
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:02,183
Rym: But if they didn't do the puzzle people would have been mad about the date and then the system and then the announcement and then We didn't get a table.

592
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:07,380
Rym: I feel like the the amount of drama remains constant regardless of all other factors, right?

593
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,260
Scott: And it's like even if you were to choose, you know, make all your decisions to make one person perfectly happy Someone else would be super angry.

594
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:19,963
Rym: Yeah, so this is the same reason why it's so hard to get a hotel at like magfest or paxies Like.

595
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:20,993
Rym: it's all the same problem.

596
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:25,132
Rym: Yep So I think we've got really long on the news.

597
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:38,210
Rym: So I think we should probably just get into The eggs of the day what he got for me, so we're well into hockey season, right?

598
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,262
Scott: Actually pretty scarily deep in hockey.

599
00:32:40,282 --> 00:32:46,790
Rym: See you asked me a few weeks ago I had a more positive opinion of the current hockey season than I do right now anyway.

600
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,738
Scott: So here is a really great video.

601
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:52,884
Scott: Somebody posted like when did they post this?

602
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:54,550
Scott: whether even if they posted it?

603
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,830
Scott: No, I think it reads very recently like a few days ago.

604
00:32:58,532 --> 00:33:02,170
Scott: But yeah, this is a video of something that doesn't happen very often in hockey.

605
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:11,850
Scott: It's so rare that they were able to compile Every instance of this ever happening in the NHL history on video, I guess every time it was recorded.

606
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:13,517
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's every time it's ever happened.

607
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:15,104
Rym: It hasn't happened that many times.

608
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:16,430
Scott: This is right really hard.

609
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:28,648
Scott: It's only like a six-minute video and it's a recording of Every single time a goalie has scored a goal most of the time by shooting for the empty net when the other team pulls the goal.

610
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:45,587
Rym: There's only two ways this can happen because it is Effectively impossible for the goalie to score a goal against another goalie Directly partly because they changed the rules in the NHL to say and this is a while ago that Goalies are not allowed to cross the center line.

611
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:47,710
Rym: That used to not be a rule.

612
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:54,689
Rym: They made a rule not for the reasons you'd think they made the rule because goalies actually did it a lot and one dude in Particular did it a lot.

613
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:59,469
Rym: He just like skate to the other side and like try to help a play and he kept getting hurt.

614
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:08,117
Rym: Goalies got hurt and NHL really does not want there to be a game where there aren't enough goalies to continue the game For reasons we've talked about before.

615
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:20,330
Rym: so the only way to get a goal as a goalie is to shoot for the empty net which is a huge risk because if you miss it's an icing usually or Get a technicality where you are technically the last one to touch the puck and then the other team scored an own goal.

616
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:21,319
Scott: I get an assist.

617
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,350
Scott: as a goalie is pretty easy.

618
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,429
Scott: You make a long pass to someone who then goes in for the shot, right?

619
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:29,021
Scott: Or, you know, you pass to someone who passes to someone who scores right.

620
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:29,422
Scott: that happened.

621
00:34:29,543 --> 00:34:32,896
Scott: goalies get assists now and then I've seen it In person getting a goal.

622
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:36,469
Scott: It's got to be some crazy fluke or something for that to happen.

623
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:43,350
Scott: So, but yeah Here's a video showing every time an NHL goalie in a regular in a real NHL game has scored a goal.

624
00:34:43,552 --> 00:34:44,119
Rym: I remember Chris.

625
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:44,849
Rym: I was good doing it.

626
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,668
Rym: He's also notable for charging out of the goal and fucking drilling somebody one time and taking a penalty for it.

627
00:34:51,252 --> 00:34:53,228
Rym: So my thing today speaking of Beavis and butthead.

628
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:59,250
Rym: Most of the time you try to find like episodes of Beavis and butthead or things like you'll just find the cartoon.

629
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:02,421
Rym: But that wasn't really the best part of Beavis and butthead.

630
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:16,649
Rym: the whole point of Beavis and butthead was that the little cartoons were Just these really simple short framing stories by Mike Judd, but most of the show was basically the Beavis and butthead characters MST3K-ing music videos because it was on MTV.

631
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:21,529
Rym: You know the station that ostensibly for a little while showed music videos.

632
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:25,945
Rym: So I found on YouTube this is probably super like bootleg.

633
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:27,370
Rym: I surely get taken down to some point.

634
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,200
Rym: This is just an episode of Beavis and butthead.

635
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:45,637
Rym: I want to say it was from like 93 or 94 But and I remember this episode because we watched it like a live on TV This was the Beavis and butthead Christmas special and it has the music videos intact Which is kind of like Muppet Babies.

636
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:46,963
Scott: How is it not taken down?

637
00:35:47,224 --> 00:35:48,630
Rym: I assume it'll get taken down to some point.

638
00:35:48,671 --> 00:35:53,489
Rym: it was uploaded like Less than three weeks ago So watch it while you can.

639
00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:58,650
Rym: This will tell you if Beavis and butthead is the kind of humor you would enjoy or not.

640
00:35:59,112 --> 00:36:02,687
Rym: And you're gonna see a side of Beavis and butthead that most younger people have never seen.

641
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:16,830
Rym: they've never seen Them just like reacting to music videos kind of like how most kids have never seen Muppet Babies Just reenacting Star Wars with clips of Star Wars interspersed Mmm in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book.

642
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:20,168
Rym: We're probably gonna do the first chapter at some point pretty early next year.

643
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:23,260
Rym: bar Not the first chapter, but like the first third the first bit.

644
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,487
Rym: pick a stopping point Tale of Genji.

645
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:26,129
Rym: We're still reading it.

646
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:32,029
Rym: I'm almost done with that World War one book that I started reading instead and got really into but I'm almost done with it.

647
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:33,555
Rym: now I'm gonna go back to this.

648
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:34,620
Rym: Mm-hmm.

649
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:35,966
Rym: We were just a PAX Unplugged.

650
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:36,710
Rym: We did two panels.

651
00:36:37,253 --> 00:36:40,690
Rym: I'm gonna edit the video together and try to get him on YouTube like by this weekend.

652
00:36:40,871 --> 00:36:44,525
Scott: We're about to go to mag fed where we are doing a bunch of panels.

653
00:36:44,545 --> 00:36:49,070
Scott: They sent me the draft schedule I gotta like confirm sent me a link and I clicked on it and it went to an error.

654
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:56,436
Rym: Well, the problem is we're doing panel panels and mages panels and I might be doing a third thing for a different group and our Panels are split between two through.

655
00:36:56,537 --> 00:36:57,722
Rym: It's it's complicated.

656
00:36:57,742 --> 00:36:59,530
Scott: The point is I clicked on a link and I got an error.

657
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,536
Scott: So, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

658
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:00,838
Rym: Yeah.

659
00:37:00,878 --> 00:37:04,528
Rym: Well as long as you get your badge, that's all that matters I will get the bad as that.

660
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,237
Rym: You know Scott we split our duties.

661
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:12,321
Rym: since I am the producer of GeekNights one of my jobs Like Scott actually makes sure the website keeps working like barely.

662
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:13,184
Rym: Yeah, barely.

663
00:37:13,285 --> 00:37:14,730
Rym: We're stay tuned on that.

664
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:15,032
Rym: We're.

665
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:19,198
Rym: there's changes coming to the website in the forum But basically Scott's the one who has to deal with me.

666
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:23,714
Rym: if I message him at 1159 and I'm like Scott the post didn't fucking Work cuz.

667
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:28,150
Rym: yeah, I'm not gonna deal with that and I have to deal with all the convention logistics.

668
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:30,842
Rym: So I am sorting out our schedule for mag fest.

669
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:32,790
Rym: We also do know our schedule.

670
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:40,285
Rym: We're doing at least one panel of PAX South the 41 tabletop games You should play which is 41 different games that we've never talked about in a panel.

671
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,690
Scott: He's not doing this panel every time.

672
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,861
Rym: It's really popular and I think it's a really good important panel.

673
00:37:43,902 --> 00:37:45,390
Rym: There's too many tabletop games.

674
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:49,150
Rym: Do you want to be the producer of GeekNights and I'll take over the sysadmin?

675
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,824
Scott: I think I could just not do a clickbait panel.

676
00:37:52,844 --> 00:37:54,010
Scott: We got plenty other panel ideas.

677
00:37:54,536 --> 00:38:03,547
Rym: Yeah, I submit a lot of panels but at the same time I have to balance with each convention and the rep I work with in the convention what they think will Draw a crowd like what they need that year where the gaps are in their programming.

678
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:04,090
Rym: It's a whole thing.

679
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:06,430
Rym: This isn't just submit panels get responses.

680
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:10,225
Rym: I have a lot of conversations with convention people that you do not have to do.

681
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:12,717
Scott: I could talk to them be like hey I really don't want to do clickbait.

682
00:38:12,737 --> 00:38:13,903
Scott: Let me do something erudite.

683
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,070
Rym: I've had those conversations.

684
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,716
Rym: That's why we kind of alter you notice like it.

685
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:19,967
Rym: packs is like sometimes we go to packs and we do like.

686
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:21,333
Scott: I decided look It's packs.

687
00:38:21,373 --> 00:38:22,056
Scott: You're selling the same.

688
00:38:22,097 --> 00:38:22,700
Scott: You're not selling it.

689
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,750
Scott: We're not selling you any badges, right?

690
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:25,958
Scott: You know, we're just to.

691
00:38:25,978 --> 00:38:26,989
Scott: you know, fill in some seats.

692
00:38:27,464 --> 00:38:28,456
Rym: Yeah but there's like.

693
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:36,670
Rym: one example is sometimes the con needs programming to another popular thing as I got to figure out like what could draw a crowd away from that other thing that's gonna fill up.

694
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:42,196
Scott: Anyway, well, I'll just tell me what that other thing is and I will talk about something That is a different topic.

695
00:38:42,217 --> 00:38:44,406
Scott: So that way so it PAX Unplugged.

696
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:46,390
Rym: It was an acting thing All right.

697
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:46,893
Scott: So I won't.

698
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,622
Scott: so I can either do something.

699
00:38:48,642 --> 00:39:02,250
Scott: I could either Target acting right and try to do RPG stuff that will bring those people over Right or I could try to do something completely opposite of RPG people So that no non RPG people will go and try to get acting seats.

700
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:10,386
Rym: But anyway, stay tuned for us at PAX South at magfest at PAX East and then I think we actually have a bros Thank icon and I think we actually have a break.

701
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:14,610
Rym: Scott might not go to zinc icon because I guess he won't be able to figure out how to take the Amtrak.

702
00:39:14,912 --> 00:39:21,141
Scott: I mean I can take the Amtrak but Penn Station is also garbage But for other reasons, but station now.

703
00:39:21,182 --> 00:39:24,153
Scott: God's not the reason I won't go to Philadelphia like.

704
00:39:24,254 --> 00:39:26,684
Rym: I respect you more than Scott, but I live in New York's.

705
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:27,970
Rym: I only can respect you so much.

706
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:32,804
Rym: but I Will agree as a New Yorker Penn Station is a fucking shithole.

707
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,190
Rym: Of course it our Penn Station.

708
00:39:35,011 --> 00:39:46,392
Rym: God, the only thing sadder than the New York City Penn Station It's where the New York City Port Authority bus station is all shitty because that's where the New Jersey leaks in Path.

709
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:49,221
Rym: I would say that about path more path is also bad.

710
00:39:49,382 --> 00:39:51,790
Rym: Yeah path is bad for other reasons.

711
00:39:53,635 --> 00:39:56,893
Rym: So Manga Distribution right.

712
00:39:56,933 --> 00:40:04,601
Scott: so this manga editor and he comes over, you know, and you know, he's asking us like hey Yeah, if we're gonna do manga digital distribution, right?

713
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:05,926
Scott: What are you guys willing to pay?

714
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,110
Scott: What would that look like?

715
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,624
Scott: Right, you know, we couldn't give such detailed answers.

716
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:10,630
Scott: There's only so much time.

717
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,995
Scott: There are a lot of people there.

718
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:14,666
Scott: there was it was like ten times as many people.

719
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:15,770
Scott: is that all the previous meetings?

720
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:16,943
Scott: It's only had like five people.

721
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:20,810
Scott: Yeah But you know, let's just talk about it in general, right?

722
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,159
Scott: So in Japan right manga goes in these magazines.

723
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:25,963
Scott: the magazine is like two dollars.

724
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:27,247
Scott: It's like four dollars.

725
00:40:27,307 --> 00:40:28,390
Scott: Maybe it's super cheap.

726
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:29,677
Scott: It's huge.

727
00:40:29,738 --> 00:40:31,649
Scott: It's like computer shopper was back in the day.

728
00:40:32,091 --> 00:40:37,470
Scott: There's one chapter each of many many many many mangas in there like 20 plus different mangas.

729
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:42,250
Scott: It would be like if you went to the comic book store and you got every single Marvel comic book.

730
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:47,777
Scott: They came out in a whole month but bound together into a single volume for $4 Whereas instead you're getting one floppy.

731
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:50,510
Rym: well and to a point kind of disposable, right?

732
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:53,870
Scott: It's also a much shittier paper and black and white and has ads in it.

733
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,910
Scott: But I guess you know you pay four dollars for a spider-man copy.

734
00:40:57,312 --> 00:41:01,710
Scott: You're getting 20 pages of spider-man with ads in it in color on fancy paper, right?

735
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:14,624
Scott: so take that spider-man put it on shitty paper in black and white keep the ads in and Combine it with all the x-men comics and the Avengers comics and the Iron Man comics and the friend is more comics and all them Together in one bound volume for the price of one floppy.

736
00:41:15,026 --> 00:41:16,210
Scott: and that's what they do in Japan.

737
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:23,917
Scott: But then they combine all the chapters of each manga together into the tanka van Which is what we read in the US.

738
00:41:23,978 --> 00:41:26,990
Scott: and you go to Barnes & Noble or whatever or Amazon and you buy a volume for?

739
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,552
Scott: 10 bucks.

740
00:41:27,913 --> 00:41:32,310
Scott: you're actually getting like, you know, eight ten chapters worth all together.

741
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:40,310
Rym: I remember as a kid like figuring some of this out like I remember, you know Manga was not really available in the US when I was really into anime.

742
00:41:40,812 --> 00:41:44,790
Rym: So like I was able to get some fan subs and I could get like some anime.

743
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,737
Rym: but manga like was not in stores.

744
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:47,922
Rym: there were not good ways to get it.

745
00:41:48,343 --> 00:42:00,406
Rym: and I remember the first time I finally found some manga and it was a big book and I was trying to figure out which like Vault like issues of this manga were in the book because there weren't really internet resources to figure that out either.

746
00:42:00,466 --> 00:42:05,983
Scott: bad hell no Right, so, you know in Japan, that's how they do it in the US.

747
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:07,930
Scott: We just do tankavans only.

748
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:10,279
Scott: Yeah, there have been attempts to do the magazine.

749
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,090
Scott: I think you can get some sort of shonen jump subscription.

750
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:14,035
Scott: You can get some right.

751
00:42:14,336 --> 00:42:20,686
Rym: It's interesting because I know a lot of like American anime fans really said Oh if they just sold shonen jump in the US, I would definitely pay for it.

752
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:22,354
Rym: kind of like Oh if New Type was in the US.

753
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:27,498
Scott: Well the thing is even when they did or if they still do right It was not the same.

754
00:42:27,598 --> 00:42:28,864
Scott: It wasn't right.

755
00:42:28,904 --> 00:42:36,267
Scott: the full shonen jump It wasn't the huge fat magazine with a shit ton of manga in it for four dollars.

756
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:48,870
Scott: Meanwhile the opposite problem right, there was like an America at one point and it was like and you know, it was a. It was a smaller magazine that had fewer titles in it and didn't come out weekly and wasn't four dollars.

757
00:42:49,031 --> 00:42:51,362
Scott: It was more expensive for less content.

758
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:57,330
Rym: Well it's the opposite of when New Type came out It was exactly the same as in Japan and people realized once they could read it that it's stupid.

759
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,296
Scott: Yes, that was a different story entirely.

760
00:42:59,316 --> 00:43:06,117
Scott: Yeah, right, but I mean if they really did sell the full Frickin magazine a big fat boy.

761
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:11,994
Scott: Yeah, it's the low ass price in English that might draw some Turn some heads.

762
00:43:12,115 --> 00:43:14,364
Scott: Yeah, but no one has done that like.

763
00:43:14,806 --> 00:43:21,890
Rym: I think part of the problem Is that there's a. there is definitely still like a bigger collector mentality among a lot of anime fans in the US.

764
00:43:22,153 --> 00:43:23,610
Scott: Well, I don't think there is at all.

765
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,596
Scott: I think what's happening is that they're not.

766
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:31,599
Scott: they don't care about collecting and they don't care about collecting so much that they don't want To even have anything right.

767
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:33,350
Scott: they don't want to spend any money.

768
00:43:33,491 --> 00:43:37,390
Rym: Well, they don't want to spend any money, but they still want stuff and they just want to read.

769
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:38,983
Scott: You know, they're setting their computer or their phone.

770
00:43:39,003 --> 00:43:41,038
Scott: They don't want to have a book Read digitally.

771
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,630
Rym: Yeah, but also one thing like with anime.

772
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:57,413
Rym: What I noticed is that once anime was just like like we're in a golden age I can just see like almost any anime I want online real cheap and There's still a significant subset of nerds in the US who like make up excuses to continue to not pay for it when it costs Almost nothing.

773
00:43:57,433 --> 00:44:01,850
Scott: Well, there is a little bit of fragmentation going on in terms of different streaming services and whatever.

774
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,290
Scott: Yeah, but manga has an even worse problem.

775
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:07,804
Rym: You go ask me what where to go to read any given manga.

776
00:44:07,844 --> 00:44:09,209
Rym: fuck if I know I'm gonna like research.

777
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,521
Scott: well There's so many mangas.

778
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,494
Scott: Yeah, right and then there's so many Untranslated ones.

779
00:44:14,594 --> 00:44:18,587
Scott: right and be it's like most animes that you're gonna want to watch.

780
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:26,172
Scott: have you know This the ones that are you want to watch that haven't been brought over or licensed or it's like are fewer and fewer Percentage.

781
00:44:26,212 --> 00:44:35,480
Scott: wise right, you know, even some old-school ones are like fully subbed and licensed and released right like every episode of Galaxy Express 39 TV series you can get.

782
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,405
Scott: it's like whoa, right?

783
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:42,686
Scott: Yeah manga There's so many they will never never will a significant portion and they're produced so quickly.

784
00:44:42,786 --> 00:44:43,729
Scott: and there's so many of them.

785
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:50,960
Scott: There will never be a significant portion that are translated to English until a computer can just do all of it at once Yep, which that day will come.

786
00:44:51,302 --> 00:44:52,469
Scott: Yeah, maybe in our lives who knows.

787
00:44:53,791 --> 00:45:02,608
Scott: but that means that there is still some real justification for Scanslation of mangas that will never be in English, right?

788
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,012
Scott: Yeah Right.

789
00:45:05,113 --> 00:45:18,293
Scott: I still even to this day support if you have a piece of artwork or media or anything book movie Whatever and nobody is legally translating it from its original language into your language Whatever that language is.

790
00:45:18,313 --> 00:45:25,857
Scott: I feel it is not only morally accepted but sort of almost not you know Comparative but like.

791
00:45:26,258 --> 00:45:33,230
Scott: it is not only okay to do but it is good to Just do it as long as you're not like selling it.

792
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,438
Rym: So here's here's a problem too.

793
00:45:35,979 --> 00:45:38,950
Rym: There are pirate sites that sell a lot of this stuff.

794
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,924
Rym: Oh, yeah cheaper than official channels or like.

795
00:45:43,065 --> 00:45:45,695
Rym: even if they're not available in official channels They're still selling it.

796
00:45:45,795 --> 00:45:55,409
Scott: right and if you go to Google and you type in a manga you want to read The pirate sites usually show up first and a lot of kids don't even know they're pirates on it because they don't.

797
00:45:55,449 --> 00:45:55,690
Scott: they're not.

798
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,235
Scott: I don't like that.

799
00:45:57,275 --> 00:45:58,961
Rym: Is that one of the legal ones of one of the illegal?

800
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:00,145
Scott: pretty sure that's illegal.

801
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:01,610
Rym: cuz sanctuary is here.

802
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,035
Rym: This seems like it's the only place to reach.

803
00:46:03,095 --> 00:46:05,584
Rym: I think I can read sanctuary right now.

804
00:46:05,665 --> 00:46:06,809
Scott: Yes, you can for free.

805
00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:08,013
Rym: Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, here we go.

806
00:46:08,093 --> 00:46:08,475
Rym: Oh shit.

807
00:46:08,535 --> 00:46:09,438
Rym: It's just sanctuary.

808
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:11,888
Scott: Yep, and nobody's doing anything to take it.

809
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:12,530
Rym: Are you sure?

810
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,593
Rym: This is illegal.

811
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:15,079
Scott: I'm 99% sure that's an illegal.

812
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,445
Scott: So here's the thing 100% without doing research.

813
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:21,160
Rym: I don't know if I don't know some 14 year old.

814
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,464
Rym: we definitely doesn't.

815
00:46:22,504 --> 00:46:24,430
Rym: if you go to Google and you search, right?

816
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,470
Rym: Oh, man, I just want to read sanctuary again, right?

817
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,221
Scott: It's like you go if you go to Pirate Bay, right?

818
00:46:29,441 --> 00:46:31,590
Rym: You know what you do, you know what you're doing.

819
00:46:31,671 --> 00:46:39,395
Scott: You realize you're buying any legal thing if you go to Amazon and you type in the name of a product and you buy it and a bootleg board game shows up at your door Which is a real thing.

820
00:46:39,777 --> 00:46:41,566
Scott: You don't know that you just bought a bootleg.

821
00:46:41,606 --> 00:46:42,810
Scott: if you're not an expert Yeah.

822
00:46:42,971 --> 00:46:48,416
Scott: So if you go to Google and you type in the name of a manga you want to read and there's a site that looks Legit works.

823
00:46:48,717 --> 00:46:53,537
Scott: lets you read the manga for free is right there It's like and looks like a real site.

824
00:46:53,557 --> 00:46:58,071
Scott: doesn't look like some site that's trying to hide something or makes you do any shenanigans Right.

825
00:46:58,594 --> 00:47:01,350
Scott: It feels like this is a legal and legit thing you're doing.

826
00:47:02,131 --> 00:47:04,161
Scott: Most people have no idea that they're doing that.

827
00:47:04,202 --> 00:47:05,649
Scott: So I don't really I don't blame them at all.

828
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:14,423
Scott: Right, you know, I know a lot of people who are anti-scandalization blame the people reading them But like I don't they know the vast majority of those people have no idea.

829
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:16,649
Scott: They think that that's just how it is.

830
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,715
Rym: Yep, right.

831
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,391
Scott: They don't know that this is some illegal thing or the

832
00:47:20,411 --> 00:47:36,530
Rym: problem is unlike with anime stuff like because manga is still a much more fractured experience and digit like Digital reading of things other than just books with text has definitely lagged behind Watching video of things in terms of devices and like good support and good UX and all those things.

833
00:47:37,172 --> 00:47:46,089
Rym: There was this space that existed for manga to have a huge and thriving pirate industry that has Significantly displaced the legitimate industry in the u.s.

834
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:46,350
Scott: Right?

835
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:51,470
Scott: Well, I mean also part of it is that even if you know, it's illegal if you don't have a lot of money, right?

836
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,269
Scott: Yeah, and you want to read?

837
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,478
Scott: One-piece how many fucking volumes is one piece have?

838
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,141
Rym: Yep.

839
00:47:57,342 --> 00:47:59,931
Rym: You know, I a bunch of line even $10.

840
00:47:59,931 --> 00:48:05,450
Scott: Like even if you buy one-piece omnibus editions that they put out which are like several volumes in one, right?

841
00:48:05,691 --> 00:48:06,613
Scott: How much is one of those?

842
00:48:06,814 --> 00:48:09,120
Scott: how much is a one-piece omnibus edition cost?

843
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:16,102
Rym: looking up right now one-piece omnibus 28 books They are 11 bucks each, right?

844
00:48:16,122 --> 00:48:17,105
Scott: So 11 times 28.

845
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:17,687
Scott: That's for a kid.

846
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:19,620
Rym: There's a lot of money right.

847
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:24,400
Scott: kids can't afford it But if they go if it's free Right that kid can read a litter.

848
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:28,177
Scott: if you're a kid with free time on your hands cuz you're a kid You can read with one piece.

849
00:48:28,217 --> 00:48:29,061
Scott: You can read all of it.

850
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:31,009
Scott: You can read all of it several times over, right?

851
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:36,070
Scott: But you could never afford to buy all of it right ever, right?

852
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:37,254
Scott: So you're not losing.

853
00:48:37,274 --> 00:48:41,990
Scott: you're losing some money because that kid could afford to buy some one-piece.

854
00:48:42,492 --> 00:48:46,588
Scott: But right the kid cannot afford to buy all the one piece he can read and that is just one.

855
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:50,990
Scott: Manga, but that gets that card can read several one pieces.

856
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:54,321
Rym: that's the other thing that happened in the manga space.

857
00:48:54,401 --> 00:49:06,462
Rym: is that the proliferation of and Digital entertainment made it such that manga now competes with a lot of other things like for example Free to view video and free to play YouTube.

858
00:49:06,482 --> 00:49:08,108
Scott: you're competing with YouTube, which is free.

859
00:49:08,128 --> 00:49:10,259
Scott: Yep I can go to YouTube actually free.

860
00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:18,830
Rym: I can go to YouTube and watch like an hour long Perfectly cut screams compilation and for a like 12 year old kid that is equally entertaining to one piece.

861
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,314
Rym: They're just looking for something right.

862
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,197
Rym: so the kill time.

863
00:49:21,237 --> 00:49:25,710
Scott: Japanese businesses, right have you know, I always do the same comparison every time.

864
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:34,345
Scott: But that's because it's true right you look at you know, say Korea a very tiny country But they put a lot of money into their music industry, which has a lot of problems.

865
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:34,686
Rym: Yeah,

866
00:49:34,927 --> 00:50:01,690
Scott: but one problem It doesn't have is becoming popular because they freely Spread their TV and their music and their movies all over the world on purpose however, YouTube channel that literally is an official channel of KBS like the national TV channel of Korea and they intentionally take their TV shows put them up for free on YouTube with subtitles on purpose.

867
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:04,904
Scott: So each K in Japan would never do something like that.

868
00:50:04,944 --> 00:50:07,193
Scott: They take that shit down Everywhere.

869
00:50:07,253 --> 00:50:08,136
Rym: long term though.

870
00:50:08,277 --> 00:50:14,906
Rym: Even that former model is unsustainable in a late capitalist world without Government subsidy of the arts to create the works.

871
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:16,314
Scott: Yes Well, but that's the thing is.

872
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:19,390
Scott: I think I think Japan does have government subsidy of the arts.

873
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:34,470
Scott: They have their whole cool Japan government program But that program still is not enough to get them to do the thing They need to do which is to allow their art to spread around the world in bulk and at low price.

874
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:35,815
Rym: I get me with freedom.

875
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:50,170
Rym: I suspect partly that that like those initiatives are held back a little bit by the Another goal of helping to monetize and protect the monetization of the internal healthy industry around this media.

876
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:55,530
Rym: Yes, you can definitely those are two mutually exclusive things in capitalism exactly.

877
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:56,340
Scott: You can see.

878
00:50:56,361 --> 00:51:07,240
Scott: you know This same business pattern in all sorts of Japanese companies behavior from Nintendo to music companies Nintendo taking down live streams right all this sort of.

879
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:15,770
Scott: you see that same mentality across, you know Japanese businesses Related to the arts especially right all over right?

880
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:23,130
Scott: They have this sort of dual thing where they want the rest of the world to care about their art and think it's cool and be interested in Japan.

881
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,289
Scott: so They can make a lot of money by selling their culture.

882
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:29,370
Scott: But they also do not want to widely and cheaply distribute.

883
00:51:29,832 --> 00:51:33,169
Rym: But there is another thing a subtle thing that can happen because we see the same thing with movies and TV.

884
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:39,370
Rym: If you have a big enough back catalogue of things you own that you can distribute and you distribute that cheaply.

885
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:44,430
Rym: Those things are often new to people of a current generation.

886
00:51:44,611 --> 00:51:49,989
Rym: Oh, yeah, and that actually can take the monetization away from anything new being made.

887
00:51:50,371 --> 00:51:52,690
Rym: Yep, like it makes a really difficult situation.

888
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:54,310
Scott: Why would I buy a new right?

889
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,244
Scott: It's like the thousands of manga that you've written over the past 30 years.

890
00:51:58,304 --> 00:52:00,030
Scott: you put you know if you make those available.

891
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:02,441
Scott: That's enough manga for me to read in my whole life.

892
00:52:02,762 --> 00:52:03,787
Rym: I've got all of dr.

893
00:52:03,827 --> 00:52:04,430
Rym: Slump up there.

894
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,218
Rym: I only made it like five volumes in right.

895
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,170
Scott: I don't need to read any new manga you make right?

896
00:52:09,832 --> 00:52:15,137
Scott: If you're in Japan and you can read Japanese, it's like why go back and read old stuff I can just read weekly.

897
00:52:15,157 --> 00:52:17,510
Scott: I can buy the giant magazine, but that is a problem.

898
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:25,010
Rym: That's just generic to a modern world where there's a lot of reasons Why it's difficult to monetize or even to support the creation of new art, right?

899
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:30,232
Scott: So I think what they should do and never will do right is they should make a Netflix like service Right.

900
00:52:30,433 --> 00:52:44,913
Scott: that provides either free trial or some manga is free some not some subscription Right something like that, but it had regardless of the details of it in order for it to succeed right it has to have large Quantity.

901
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:46,561
Rym: well crunchy roll is a lot of manga.

902
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:50,236
Rym: I can read it for free for 14 days Yes, but the crunchy roll not know.

903
00:52:50,276 --> 00:52:56,296
Scott: the quantity of manga on crunchy roll is not many titles It is.

904
00:52:56,336 --> 00:52:57,202
Rym: those are the popular ones.

905
00:52:57,223 --> 00:52:58,230
Rym: there's a decent number here.

906
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:02,183
Scott: There's a decent number, but it is not like you know vast.

907
00:53:02,504 --> 00:53:05,357
Scott: so it compared to the right here That's all of them.

908
00:53:05,497 --> 00:53:06,724
Scott: that is not a large number.

909
00:53:06,825 --> 00:53:10,139
Scott: I mean yep, right I'm talking like even just the young man.

910
00:53:10,179 --> 00:53:16,540
Rym: well, so this is another problem this there's a difference between discoverability Versus like interest.

911
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,250
Scott: coverability is a separate problem Yeah, but the point is regardless of discoverability in the system.

912
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:27,670
Rym: But I'm saying interest most people in America like anime fans other than like super fans who pay a lot of attention.

913
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:31,797
Rym: They seem to want to read manga That they are told to.

914
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:32,279
Rym: they like.

915
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:35,050
Rym: they find out about it because an anime was made about it.

916
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,728
Rym: Maybe then they want to read the manga like attack on Titan.

917
00:53:37,788 --> 00:53:44,130
Scott: sure But if you're going to chart you're gonna need to charge someone dollars per month or per year for the to access to the service.

918
00:53:44,631 --> 00:53:53,076
Scott: Right even if you have say you had a service that was literally all the popular mangas that anime But no other mangas right.

919
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:55,803
Scott: maybe some people would pay for that kind of service.

920
00:53:56,064 --> 00:54:00,800
Scott: right, but that's not gonna get people subscribing Forever because they'll read all the kids.

921
00:54:01,081 --> 00:54:02,748
Scott: they would be able to read all those manga.

922
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:07,850
Scott: and yeah Right in order to get someone to pay you need quantity, right?

923
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:17,478
Scott: You need to have you know hundreds or perhaps even thousands of titles in that library like hey Pay us you know five bucks a month, and you'll have access.

924
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:21,870
Scott: you'll have a library of thousands of manga every volume all transit.

925
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,077
Rym: It's like a reader dotnet safe and legal.

926
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:25,041
Rym: No it is not legal.

927
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:25,442
Rym: No.

928
00:54:25,582 --> 00:54:26,084
Rym: I looked it up.

929
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:26,686
Scott: There you go.

930
00:54:27,128 --> 00:54:30,496
Scott: obviously not What you need right.

931
00:54:30,696 --> 00:54:34,187
Scott: you need the low price even if it's month right relatively low.

932
00:54:34,207 --> 00:54:36,441
Scott: it has to be cheaper than Netflix I think net right.

933
00:54:37,128 --> 00:54:41,424
Scott: and Because people value comics and manga less than they value like movies.

934
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:42,969
Scott: Yeah as a thing.

935
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:54,767
Rym: well I mean that the the relative valuation is a weird situation Especially in the US right now because people will flip the fuck out if you want them to pay like $10 for a video game that they play for a hundred hours.

936
00:54:55,089 --> 00:54:59,490
Rym: yet They'll happily pay $20 to see an hour and ten minute movie in a theater.

937
00:54:59,651 --> 00:55:00,335
Scott: I think that's even.

938
00:55:00,436 --> 00:55:05,060
Scott: what's even crazier is people are happy to spend 15 to 20 dollars to see a movie in a theater.

939
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:05,481
Scott: that's that.

940
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:13,610
Scott: maybe even if it's a three hour movie right they'll pay $15 to see Star Wars, but an app that they will use every day of their lives on their phone.

941
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,990
Scott: They will not pay a dollar only free apps for me.

942
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:22,930
Scott: I won't pay a dollar for now But they'll go to a movie for $15 which is partly the cancer of late capitalism coupled with the cancer of free-to-play.

943
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:31,129
Rym: Having skewed prices coupled with Media has not raised its prices in America at the same rate as inflation.

944
00:55:31,149 --> 00:55:32,714
Scott: wages Also have not risen.

945
00:55:32,734 --> 00:55:37,930
Rym: to my trip a triple-a game in 2019 still cost seventy eighty dollars a triple-a game.

946
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:41,281
Scott: People can't afford more than that at once because their wages haven't risen.

947
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:46,121
Rym: but a triple-a game in 1986 cost 70 to 80 1986 dollars people.

948
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:50,136
Scott: but you can trick people Like 300 bucks right.

949
00:55:50,156 --> 00:55:52,643
Scott: you have to trick people into spending more than they can afford.

950
00:55:52,703 --> 00:55:55,533
Scott: you can't do that by charging the giant price Up front.

951
00:55:55,553 --> 00:56:02,428
Scott: you need to do shit against like gambling right which again You could charge a higher price if you raised wages.

952
00:56:02,448 --> 00:56:03,112
Rym: well I'm so well.

953
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:06,410
Scott: and also what we would say I can't afford a hundred dollar video game.

954
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:09,850
Rym: There's that there's an even further undercurrent here the manga industry.

955
00:56:10,332 --> 00:56:12,644
Rym: You know the the anime industry is pretty exploitative.

956
00:56:12,705 --> 00:56:13,710
Rym: people don't make it.

957
00:56:14,432 --> 00:56:17,481
Rym: Manga is a fucked-up situation in Japan.

958
00:56:17,702 --> 00:56:20,470
Scott: Oh, yeah you if you're a manga artist you work in crazy hours.

959
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,718
Scott: You're getting paid like nothing right.

960
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:23,762
Scott: It's not good times.

961
00:56:23,823 --> 00:56:25,770
Scott: It is not a glamorous life whatsoever.

962
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:35,150
Scott: So on top of that they're charging $4 for a magazine And I guess splitting that $4 up between everybody in the magazine which is a lot of bat manga artists.

963
00:56:35,211 --> 00:56:36,642
Rym: I mean you see this with like Spotify.

964
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:37,530
Rym: how much money better?

965
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:47,260
Scott: Hope your tonka bond sell like crazy and your manga is super popular or you're gonna be eating you know like Not-very-good food yep and living in a tiny tiny cold place.

966
00:56:47,461 --> 00:56:53,380
Rym: and the last time I saw so any numbers about this stuff like like In the pre digital like the DVD days.

967
00:56:54,002 --> 00:57:08,478
Rym: I remember when I got some inside information When we're at RIT anime like we were working with some of the anime companies And we found out how many copies of certain anime were actually sold to people in America And what was considered a success.

968
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,189
Rym: and all I'm gonna say is that those numbers were?

969
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:15,661
Rym: Way lower than you would expect even if you were pessimistic.

970
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,785
Rym: well those are in different.

971
00:57:16,805 --> 00:57:18,050
Scott: those are in certain times.

972
00:57:18,271 --> 00:57:25,420
Rym: Yeah, I'm saying even in that time I remember I saw this number for a recent popular anime And they were like this is the best-selling anime of the year.

973
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,148
Rym: and all I thought was what the fuck.

974
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:31,447
Scott: oh Yeah, funny even comic books in the US those $4 spider-man's.

975
00:57:31,507 --> 00:57:32,532
Scott: yeah, right It's like.

976
00:57:32,954 --> 00:57:42,774
Scott: it's like okay like if Batman is set like is hot It'll maybe sell like tens of thousands of copies You know in a week if Batman comes out And that's that's like a good.

977
00:57:42,914 --> 00:57:44,299
Scott: that's like real good.

978
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,670
Scott: tens of thousands in a country of hundreds of millions of people.

979
00:57:47,751 --> 00:57:52,866
Rym: I'll tell you what I want all right I would just like there be an app that works on tablet mangas to sell.

980
00:57:53,227 --> 00:58:04,577
Rym: you know Way way way more than that if they're an app that just worked on tablets generally like Android tablets and like there's all kinds of tablets and had a desktop version because I'm like on my laptop or Whatever should work on every device.

981
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:12,653
Scott: I've got yeah, and it should synchronize between every device I've got so I can pick up where I left off like your Kindle does but don't tie it to Amazon and also don't buy Amazon tablets.

982
00:58:12,673 --> 00:58:25,870
Rym: they kind of they're kind of shitty yeah, so and I don't even need new manga I actually would just want like a wide collection of Classic old manga like a wide selection and that would do me.

983
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:30,308
Rym: I would pay for that probably forever as long as it's a manga that is my style right.

984
00:58:30,429 --> 00:58:34,926
Rym: you know It's like I go back and read like a whole bunch of ridiculous lengthy nonsense.

985
00:58:35,046 --> 00:58:42,750
Scott: He told us about a manga He worked on that failed about some girl who solves problem with solves problems with her advanced knowledge of physics.

986
00:58:42,971 --> 00:58:45,870
Rym: I thought you're gonna say something very different cuz I was thinking about suki kimusume.

987
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,260
Scott: I know he talked about this manga.

988
00:58:47,281 --> 00:58:48,429
Scott: that was like a failure of his.

989
00:58:49,153 --> 00:58:52,085
Scott: And I was like I want to read that manga that sounds like the best manga.

990
00:58:52,105 --> 00:58:52,607
Scott: I've ever heard.

991
00:58:52,627 --> 00:58:54,206
Scott: yeah, right I want to read that right now.

992
00:58:54,711 --> 00:59:03,770
Scott: And it's like that's the kind of obscure o manga that like started ran a few chapters Dot was cancelled right that you would find in a truly vast library.

993
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:04,498
Scott: You would never will.

994
00:59:04,538 --> 00:59:05,549
Scott: no one would ever pay for that.

995
00:59:05,972 --> 00:59:09,329
Scott: I would pay wouldn't even pay a dollar to read that but I really want to read.

996
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:10,576
Scott: well I would pay a dollar to read it.

997
00:59:10,636 --> 00:59:14,419
Scott: as long as it came with a zillion other manga to read The other way it could go.

998
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:21,949
Rym: that I would be okay with is The same reason why I balk so much at using other game stores than steam even though there's problems with monopolies.

999
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:27,788
Rym: if Because there's just one app where I can just like see and buy a bunch of stuff and that app is consistent.

1000
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:33,355
Rym: if there Was an app where I could just buy almost any manga you never had to pay each time I wanted a different as

1001
00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:35,546
Scott: long as the price was like a few cents or something even

1002
00:59:35,566 --> 00:59:36,410
Rym: if it was a few dollars

1003
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:40,345
Scott: Right or even if it was like an audible token system like I think audible is like.

1004
00:59:40,365 --> 00:59:41,269
Scott: that's like the audio.

1005
00:59:42,193 --> 00:59:43,548
Scott: Oh, yeah, book on the audio.

1006
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:45,999
Scott: What if it was like where you pay for this ad?

1007
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,835
Rym: you'll get like you can read up to 10 volumes of manga a month And you can pay for more.

1008
00:59:50,257 --> 00:59:51,161
Rym: sure right.

1009
00:59:51,202 --> 00:59:52,930
Scott: It's like all right you get 20 volumes a month.

1010
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:55,830
Scott: It's like I can only really read 20 volumes a month, so that sounds great.

1011
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:56,894
Rym: But then you hook people by.

1012
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:01,109
Rym: anything you've read stays in your catalog forever unless you stop paying the big yep.

1013
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:05,907
Rym: sure I guess the subscription service that wouldn't be a vague because this is a legitimate business, but I digress.

1014
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:06,369
Scott: right.

1015
01:00:06,389 --> 01:00:08,579
Scott: you know It's it's whatever it is right.

1016
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,061
Scott: You know.

1017
01:00:09,182 --> 01:00:09,543
Scott: It's it's.

1018
01:00:09,624 --> 01:00:10,307
Scott: that's what they need.

1019
01:00:10,327 --> 01:00:17,449
Rym: they need quantity They need reach and we need to destroy capitalism so we can support artists actually making stuff, right?

1020
01:00:22,571 --> 01:00:25,110
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1021
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:30,026
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1022

1023
01:00:35,525 --> 01:00:42,550
Rym: remember GeekNights is not one But four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

1024
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:46,445
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license.

1025
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:52,465
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows.

1026
01:00:52,586 --> 01:00:53,890
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.

1027
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:09,729
Rym: And the patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights for trying to get in as many episodes as we can While we have time to do episodes between all these conventions gives me a lot of video hitting the YouTube channel.

1028
01:01:10,972 --> 01:01:17,463
Rym: It does take a lot more total time to make a video From a convention of a brand new panel than it does to do a podcast.

1029
01:01:17,764 --> 01:01:21,945
Rym: so you'll see fewer GeekNights But you'll see more YouTube content at least for the time being.

1030
01:01:22,267 --> 01:01:24,142
Rym: but anyway Here we go.
