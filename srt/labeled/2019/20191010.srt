Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:29,000
Rym: We actually struggled to have a sort of you know, this format of GeekNights.

6
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:33,150
Rym: We do an open ebit that makes us human like oh, yeah Here's some anecdote from my life.

7
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:34,236
Rym: and then we talk about the news.

8
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:34,840
Rym: then we do main.

9
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:40,020
Scott: Built up during our minor hiatus we all forgotten all forgotten as predicted.

10
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:41,706
Rym: I feel like every day.

11
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:43,672
Scott: I actually did a lot of you know, not had.

12
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:46,140
Scott: my recent days have been not normal days.

13
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:48,720
Scott: I wasn't like, you know going to the office going to work coming home.

14
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,932
Scott: I was home one day getting a furniture delivery putting furniture.

15
00:00:51,992 --> 00:00:53,759
Scott: I built like four IKEA things in a day.

16
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,056
Scott: Yeah, and today that my hanging guy came.

17
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:59,960
Rym: the other weekend We went out and did a really really grueling difficult hike upstate.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,799
Scott: He hung up much of shit on the walls as I paid him to.

19
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:06,311
Scott: Just as awesome dude as last time did a great job.

20
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:06,693
Scott: It's like.

21
00:01:07,054 --> 00:01:08,260
Scott: what is there to say about that?

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,488
Scott: We just I already said everything about it.

23
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:11,995
Rym: Yep, and nothing.

24
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:19,290
Scott: if there were no unusual events during those, you know Things right to tell a story about and

25
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:27,608
Rym: I already talked about the more recent unusual events but no one usual event has happened to me in the net in the last like 27 ish hours that I can think of.

26
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:39,054
Scott: so I guess the only minor thing I can mention is that my new apartment directly outside the window of my apartment is The height is like directly across the street.

27
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:39,980
Scott: like look out the window.

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:52,760
Scott: there it is, you can look into the window of the hot the high school like the fancy Long Island City High School and Basically, I figure out a class that's there and post relevant things for kids to cheat with.

29
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:55,740
Scott: I don't think they can see into our apartment and I could put stuff on the balcony.

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,130
Scott: But anyway, but of a big banner, that's just like Barely, I'm sort of at the edge of the building.

31
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,722
Scott: what I can see the entirety of is The field.

32
00:02:05,063 --> 00:02:13,172
Scott: so basically I have my balcony is like like a like a a plus like first Mezzanine seat to see the entire sports field.

33
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:21,860
Scott: watch every high school sport for free Without paying any money to the kids of the donation bucket at the fence as if you'd want to watch any of those sports.

34
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:23,187
Rym: Let's see when I was in high school.

35
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,380
Scott: I've been seeing a lot of free high school sports.

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,684
Scott: It's not a football game.

37
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:29,231
Scott: There was soccer today when I was coming over.

38
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:31,758
Scott: So despite being really annoying the negative part.

39
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:36,407
Scott: Is that Already twice early in the morning Relatively early.

40
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:50,423
Rym: We've been woken up by football practice going like You just should thank Satan that this isn't the Midwest because you'd be woken up this season every morning by a marching band The mark.

41
00:02:50,443 --> 00:02:51,366
Scott: there is a band.

42
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:53,133
Scott: it was not large.

43
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,200
Scott: you would you would say that it was minuscule.

44
00:02:55,561 --> 00:03:00,800
Rym: I mean by your measurement, it's got to be over a hundred kids or it's not a much of a marching band.

45
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,847
Scott: I'd say this what this wasn't even tens of kids.

46
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,436
Rym: Ah, that's so that's during the football game.

47
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:10,659
Scott: I did here like, you know, do Oh, yeah, that sounds like a cadence.

48
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:13,800
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, there was some kind of some kind of banding happening.

49
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:17,380
Rym: So I think back now as a kid despite know my high school had a hockey team.

50
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:25,079
Rym: But because they played like off-site because even though this was a really like wealthy high school Even the wealthy high school cannot afford its own ice rink.

51
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:30,426
Scott: So no our highs know there was a in In Connecticut where I lived.

52
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:35,502
Scott: the ice rink was called Wonderland device and that's where pretty much all ice related things in the area Happened.

53
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:39,798
Rym: Yep, so I never once saw our hockey team play because I just didn't.

54
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:40,300
Scott: oh, I didn't know.

55
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,615
Scott: I didn't see our high school team hockey hockey team.

56
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:45,303
Rym: I went to HL games.

57
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:47,993
Rym: I never went to a basketball game the school had.

58
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:48,877
Rym: I never went to any sports.

59
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:52,885
Rym: the school did accept football because since I was in the marching band I was forced to like.

60
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:53,869
Rym: I was not optional.

61
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:54,833
Rym: I would be in trouble if I didn't.

62
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:58,068
Scott: I never went to any of my high School sporting events ever.

63
00:03:58,732 --> 00:04:05,180
Rym: and I'm when I was a senior I started going to basketball games only because the pep band had started to kind of collapse.

64
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:13,374
Rym: So I kind of took over the pep band and ran it which meant I had to go to every stupid game and because we Couldn't get any percussionist to join the pep band.

65
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:16,588
Rym: I Basically played drums for this band.

66
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:17,892
Scott: I did go to see.

67
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,055
Scott: I wasn't in high school.

68
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:25,332
Scott: Yeah, I think I might have been in middle school But at the high school that I went to there was a charity game.

69
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:31,660
Scott: I forget if it was Harlem Wizards or Harlem Globetrotters versus New York Football Giants.

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,847
Rym: Wow, that's actually pretty funny.

71
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:37,758
Scott: that actually happened at my high school actually went to it.

72
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:42,217
Scott: I remember I think Lawrence Baker the touchdown maker was there.

73
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:45,166
Scott: Whoa The Giants got crushed.

74
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:46,873
Scott: Yeah, they're playing basketball.

75
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:47,757
Scott: They were playing football.

76
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:48,500
Scott: Yeah, right.

77
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,289
Scott: So it was like five New York Giants maybe a couple like let's watch the New York Rangers play Overwatch against the couple.

78
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,155
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

79
00:04:56,215 --> 00:05:02,660
Rym: That's exactly Z bad like his tracer and he just keeps jumping off the edge.

80
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:06,060
Scott: You have a good time and the money goes to some kind of charity thing.

81
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,376
Scott: You wait in line to get autographs from.

82
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:09,944
Scott: you know All the play.

83
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:23,917
Rym: so I'm both teams in the entirety of my time at high school despite being obligated To go to every fucking home football game for the entirety of my time in high school I never saw the second half of any football game because we after that halftime performance.

84
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:24,599
Scott: You're like see ya.

85
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,368
Rym: Yeah, literally, so what's funny though?

86
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:28,800
Scott: I talked to the long time perform at the end if you won.

87
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:31,259
Rym: No, okay, cuz we were in a pep band.

88
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:32,845
Rym: We were the marching band.

89
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:33,869
Rym: so we'd we do the.

90
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,140
Rym: we'd play the the national anthem in the beginning at halftime.

91
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,230
Scott: You should have just spelled out like fuck right on the field.

92
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:41,133
Scott: We are.

93
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:43,160
Scott: we pulled a few pranks like go other team.

94
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:45,288
Rym: We uh, we did pranks.

95
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,553
Scott: right you were Detroit.

96
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,120
Scott: You should have been like go Chicago.

97
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:57,340
Rym: but The the two things that were notable and weird about that was that we had a full football field On our school like multiple football fields.

98
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,620
Rym: We had one real one and a whole bunch of practice fields.

99
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:07,574
Rym: But the real field with bleachers like full-on everything lights Was too close to the m53 a highway.

100
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:18,879
Rym: So the state for I don't know if the state of the county they basically banned us from ever having the lights turned on So meaning we can never have a night game.

101
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,184
Scott: So why have the lights?

102
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:27,312
Rym: because the lights were there before the highway was like upgraded or something Did get used at one point.

103
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:28,520
Rym: yeah long before I got to the ice.

104
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:36,000
Scott: So our high school switched from being Pepsi school to a coke school at some point during while I was in high school.

105
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,100
Rym: We had neither we banned it we banned it all while I was in high school.

106
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,620
Scott: They switched from a Pepsi school to a coke school to get money to get new lights Oh or to get lights to begin with I forget.

107
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:52,481
Rym: So basically you scoreboard and this crazy football field with a full-on bleachers and everything could only be used by the marching band Cuz.

108
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:57,433
Rym: we were the only people who would use it during the day Mmm, but that meant every home.

109
00:06:57,454 --> 00:06:58,920
Rym: so there were four high schools in our area.

110
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:08,643
Rym: Stevenson was one of was the crappiest of them and it was like our rival because we chose our rival to be the crappiest of them obviously and We were the biggest.

111
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:12,840
Rym: they uh, we had to have all our home football games at their school.

112
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:18,774
Rym: So when we played them There would be home games and away games, but they're always there and they.

113
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:20,220
Scott: it's called MetLife Stadiums, right?

114
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,714
Scott: The New Jersey football teams play there and it sucked cuz.

115
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:26,118
Rym: it meant every time there's a football game There were a lot of them.

116
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:46,347
Rym: We had to go to our high school and then the whole marching band would be put on like 20s like yellow school buses and be taken to this other school to do the thing and Either you could try to get on one of the ten buses that would leave from that school and take you back to where you left your car at our high school or You had to stay to the end of the game and then the other half of the buses would leave.

117
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:50,990
Rym: the other half of the buses are always empty because everyone just got a Home because nobody wanted to see football.

118
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:59,140
Rym: and the funniest part was All the people who came to see the game other than the parents of the kids who played football also left at halftime.

119
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,306
Rym: So it was basically empty.

120
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:04,016
Scott: There weren't too many spectators at the football game.

121
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:08,127
Scott: I watched they were Long Island City, I think lost.

122
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:11,300
Scott: Yeah, they were just winning a gold soccer though three nothing just now.

123
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:14,500
Rym: So there's a bunch of news going on and I think I said this in the forum.

124
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,435
Rym: But this the Hong Kong issues and the Chinese censorship in the u.s.

125
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:23,667
Rym: Is actually kind of exploding like Exploding across all fronts.

126
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:26,515
Rym: Yep, and it's not that nothing's different.

127
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:28,240
Scott: The NBA front is probably the top front.

128
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,614
Rym: Yeah, the Blizzard front similarly big front

129
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:36,120
Scott: was the second front But now the Apple front has come in and pushed it into pushed itself in the second place

130
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:56,252
Rym: Yep, and I think people are starting to realize that like I said on Twitter instead on the show This is every front because every American company in every industry tries to avoid pissing China off and This is all gonna get pushed to a head in a hurry Because I I the cave as soon as all these domestic American.

131
00:08:56,272 --> 00:09:06,865
Scott: you just have to be a company that does something that is so Safe such as there is like for example, if you make I don't know fucking Children's board games.

132
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:12,650
Scott: It's like nothing you do is offensive to anyone on earth Unless you also don't manufacture it in China.

133
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,213
Rym: just in case.

134
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:17,389
Scott: I'm just saying it's like, you know You're not printing anything with a map of China on it.

135
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:18,835
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing polite, right?

136
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:20,160
Rym: It is easy to mess up though.

137
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,223
Rym: Do you know many things I've seen?

138
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:31,960
Rym: we're like an incidental background image in a video game is a stock image of a classroom That happens to have a map that happens to not show China owning one specific fucking island in the middle of the Pacific.

139
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:34,240
Scott: I'm just saying like that happens, right?

140
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:42,868
Scott: but I'm saying like if you you know if the company unless you're a company does something that is so mundane like You make bagels Then it's like there's nothing.

141
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:49,040
Scott: a fan, you know, unless there's some bagel-hating country It's like there's nothing offensive to anyone about what you do any reasonable person.

142
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,040
Scott: I wonder if I come if you do any China, right, but if you do anything, you know a sport it's like oh we play basketball.

143
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,742
Scott: What's offensive?

144
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:56,083
Scott: nothing.

145
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:58,069
Scott: but the fact is if you do something that big.

146
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:05,814
Scott: then you have all these parts, you know public famous Participants and now you're open to anything that they say and do right.

147
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:16,617
Scott: so that involves all sports anything Streaming anything media based right and of course anything Entertainment or content based where you might be creating artwork.

148
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:19,688
Scott: That is Offensive to someone somewhere right.

149
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:23,080
Scott: music movies books, you know anything like that.

150
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,649
Scott: Get you know games that aren't just simple like Mario anything, you know Mario's like okay for the whole world, but you know Anything else?

151
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,928
Rym: Oh So we are not blocked in China yet.

152
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,377
Scott: No, why would we ever know we're so small.

153
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:37,140
Scott: They wouldn't notice us.

154
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,613
Scott: Yep, it's a manual blocking process challenge accepted.

155
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:49,155
Scott: in order for us to be blocked in China We would need like people in China and to like start spreading us around like oh my god Check out these two podcasting dudes in China.

156
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:51,459
Scott: Yeah You know talking shit.

157
00:10:51,961 --> 00:11:01,335
Rym: So the one thing I will disclose those because in the course of that report like I'm very much against Blizzard on this But as you all know, I also own kind of a lot of stock in Blizzard.

158
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:07,637
Rym: So One to avoid a conflict of interest in being able to cover this fairly and two cuz.

159
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:10,488
Rym: I Don't know how this is all gonna end.

160
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:12,460
Rym: So also it's just enlightened self-interest.

161
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,429
Rym: I divested myself of all of my investments in Blizzard.

162
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:17,652
Rym: I sold all my stock.

163
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:18,914
Scott: How much could you possibly have?

164
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:29,176
Rym: Uh, I Don't know if I actually want to say how much I had but it was mainly Many many shares few thousands of dollars.

165
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:32,711
Rym: No, no more like Many tens of thousands of dollars.

166
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:33,798
Scott: Yeah, well buy me something.

167
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:36,349
Rym: then I'm gonna buy some other stock.

168
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,254
Scott: buy me a car.

169
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:38,500
Scott: put it in the garage in my building.

170
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,026
Rym: Why would I buy you a car?

171
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:41,714
Rym: Do you want to split a car?

172
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:43,160
Scott: No, I want a free car.

173
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:44,899
Rym: No, I'm not gonna give you a free car.

174
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:49,440
Scott: However, that's the only kind of car I'll accept I would split a car that we could both use.

175
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,680
Rym: I know half of parking in your stupid building.

176
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,127
Rym: No, fuck is my building like.

177
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:56,626
Rym: no buildings here are allowed to have parking garages fuck Huh, which I'm glad for.

178
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:58,355
Rym: I'm glad that nobody here has a place to park.

179
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:05,979
Scott: Yeah in my building They're desperate to have people by the parking spots that are in the garage underneath the building But the biking bike parking ahead to get another rack.

180
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:09,894
Rym: I've been down in that garage in your building.

181
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:10,600
Rym: fuck cars.

182
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,080
Scott: The only car I want is one that caused me nothing cuz that's how much I'm willing to pay thing.

183
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,376
Rym: It's the only times I need a car is to go skiing in the winter.

184
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:16,940
Rym: That's right.

185
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:22,400
Scott: So and I thought I looked into BMW zip cars in that garage because I guess they couldn't sell the spots.

186
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:26,497
Scott: But zip car is so expensive, but I had to pay the annual fee.

187
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,080
Scott: So fuck that.

188
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:28,720
Rym: No, the annual fee is trivial.

189
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,000
Rym: The problem was zip cars that it ends up costing like over a hundred dollars a day to actually use the cars.

190
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:34,836
Scott: Oh fuck that too.

191
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:44,240
Rym: to use one of those zip cars over a weekend is terrifyingly expensive because they Their business model assumed you'd use it like in the city like using it to do stuff in the city.

192
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,607
Rym: But no one uses them for that.

193
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:55,640
Rym: They use them to go out of town on the weekends, of course, so Anyway, the Blizzard like the China Blizzard stuff is going to continue to escalate and it's a rapidly moving space.

194
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:59,074
Rym: So I'm assuming by the time we do our next Tuesday episode of GeekNights.

195
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:00,419
Rym: There's gonna be a lot to say about it.

196
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,448
Rym: Hmm in other news we cannot avoid this.

197
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:18,700
Rym: as you know America's been in the throes of a constitutional crisis since January 21st 2016 basically and it's only been escalating since then and you might think But Rym if it's been escalating that whole time how much more could it escalate?

198
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,419
Rym: Well, let me tell you it escalated more in the last three hours than it did in the last week.

199
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:37,040
Scott: I mean, I gotta say the one thing that really Raised my eyebrow Right is I have heard people who are usually the kind of people that I get mad at for being far too reasonable.

200
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:39,286
Scott: Right, you know those people.

201
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:47,880
Scott: Yeah, please come testify and then well You know, I mean like, you know public figures who are like on the news or whatever, right?

202
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,510
Scott: You know the kind of people who are usually like, you know rule of law this and that Reasonable reasonable.

203
00:13:54,530 --> 00:14:00,800
Scott: They're not people who are like Revolution burn down shoot everybody, you know crazy talk, right?

204
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,306
Scott: But those people right.

205
00:14:03,628 --> 00:14:09,552
Scott: we're suggesting one particular crazy thing Which is the cut right the most reason.

206
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:11,260
Rym: this is Scott kind of thing, right?

207
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,586
Rym: Normally the kind of thing that Scott would say.

208
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:19,000
Scott: Yeah, right as a crazy not entirely serious thing like oh do this thing obvious, right?

209
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,408
Scott: Very deep people who are far too reasonable.

210
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:34,869
Scott: We're suggesting right that the House of Representatives To enforce its subpoena power should send out the entirely ceremonial Person the sergeant-at-arms.

211
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:35,773
Rym: Oh to go arrest them.

212
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,938
Scott: to go and arrest people.

213
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:43,310
Scott: and I'm like That is a ceremonial dude who holds a mace and There's not someone who goes there.

214
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,817
Rym: I wanted to be Chekhov's mace.

215
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:45,359
Scott: go use it.

216
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:48,175
Scott: The mace is a fashe's first of all, which is not cool.

217
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:51,647
Rym: Yeah But it's tricky because that predates.

218
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:52,168
Scott: it does.

219
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:55,717
Rym: but any of the point is that I feel like we should still change it.

220
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,905
Scott: that dude is Entirely ceremonial.

221
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,276
Scott: there is that's like crown jewel ceremonial.

222
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:04,528
Scott: There is nothing Actual enforcement about it.

223
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:07,704
Scott: if that dude went to arrest someone with a gun Right.

224
00:15:07,744 --> 00:15:08,810
Scott: I don't even know who it is.

225
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,004
Scott: Is it is it even someone who's like Physically powerful?

226
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:13,669
Scott: or is it like an old ceremonial dude?

227
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:14,512
Scott: is even a dude?

228
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:27,394
Scott: see it could be anybody as much as I love Like the most ridiculous for super reasonable people were suggesting that and me crazy person Saying know what that person isn't doing jack shit.

229
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:28,460
Scott: They're just there to death.

230
00:15:28,742 --> 00:15:30,900
Scott: They're just there to like, you know do a well thing.

231
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:38,104
Rym: So here's the thing in reality, but what that person represents is a power that the house has yes Symbolic power.

232
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:41,514
Rym: Well, no literal power that just happens to have not been exercised.

233
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:43,760
Scott: Yes, but it is also entirely symbolic.

234
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:52,899
Scott: I don't think in the history of the United States that person the sergeant-at-arms has ever had to do anything Except like maybe kick a drunken person out of the house or something, right?

235
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:57,352
Rym: Now I'm looking to see if there's got to be some crazy story of them doing.

236
00:15:57,392 --> 00:16:08,928
Scott: I'm sure there is but they've never I don't Think gone out and gotten someone else to drag them in with you know as a subpoena All right, well Theoretically they could get other people.

237
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,831
Scott: who is the person?

238
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:15,823
Rym: it's this guy right now named Paul Irving.

239
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:17,409
Scott: what's up Paul Paul?

240
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,851
Scott: What's?

241
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:18,874
Scott: what's Paul all about?

242
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:20,400
Rym: Paul is I don't know.

243
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,392
Rym: He's all about being the sergeant-at-arms, I guess.

244
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:23,398
Scott: Yeah, what is the cheese?

245
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,760
Rym: All right, our GeekNights is now devolved into reading Wikipedia.

246
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:31,995
Rym: So as one of its first resolution you heard this about this, right?

247
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:33,219
Scott: Yeah people suggesting this.

248
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,908
Rym: Yeah Oh Billy believe me.

249
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:36,840
Rym: Where do I hang out politically?

250
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,187
Rym: Bark is where I hang out.

251
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:41,600
Scott: Okay, then people definitely were talking about this day.

252
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:52,800
Rym: So basically all one of the very first things the first Congress did after the Constitution Which for those of you who don't know was way after the revolution.

253
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:57,487
Rym: We actually fucked up and made a whole different government and it didn't work at all And we gave up on it and we started over.

254
00:16:57,628 --> 00:17:00,060
Scott: they teach it in school, but people sleep through that and don't remember it.

255
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,980
Scott: Yeah, they don't fully understand what was being said.

256
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,520
Scott: In fact when it was the Confederate the Articles of Confederation were taught to me in school.

257
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:09,415
Scott: It took me like two days into that sector realize.

258
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:10,339
Rym: I wasn't the Civil War.

259
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:12,792
Scott: No to realize like what the fuck are they talking about?

260
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:18,672
Scott: It's like wait, wait, wait Revolution and then we did something else and then oh, I'm like.

261
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:19,796
Scott: the Constitution wasn't from 1776 also.

262
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,946
Rym: Yeah, we had government one.

263
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,700
Scott: I did white government one.

264
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:27,099
Scott: Why didn't you say this like repeatedly on the first day of this section?

265
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:30,680
Rym: I can explain this to modern modern listeners of GeekNights.

266
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:34,910
Rym: So the public beta of the US government didn't go so well, that's right.

267
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:44,105
Rym: So this is basically one of the first things we ever did as a nation, okay Establish this role.

268
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:47,800
Rym: They are the chief law enforcement officer of the house, correct?

269
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,992
Rym: They're responsible for security of the physical building.

270
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:51,213
Scott: Yes.

271
00:17:51,273 --> 00:17:53,140
Scott: It's like a bailiff in a in a court.

272
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:57,986
Scott: It's not like a you know a cop who can arrest people Under the direction of the speaker.

273
00:17:58,006 --> 00:17:59,912
Rym: they are Maintain.

274
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:02,000
Rym: they are responsible for maintaining order in decorum.

275
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:03,003
Scott: Yes.

276
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:04,850
Scott: Like I said, I'd kick out a drunken dude.

277
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,181
Rym: Yeah, uh, the house could basically decide whatever they.

278
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:10,670
Rym: the house can decide what this person's duties are.

279
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:17,376
Rym: Of course the house could say erratically house gonna point an army under this dude if they wanted to Enforce the rules of the house.

280
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:20,907
Scott: Yes, of course on paper that will never happen.

281
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:21,509
Scott: That's crazy.

282
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:21,770
Scott: Talk.

283
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:23,828
Scott: Why are reasonable people making crazy talk?

284
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:42,410
Rym: Because it's not that crazy because we're in the middle of a crisis in the sense that if the White House Refuses to follow the Constitution which they've literally like The White House literally sent a letter to the House of Representatives Like this is not a joke saying we do not recognize your authority to impeach the president.

285
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:45,800
Scott: Like that is fucked up shit, right?

286
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,310
Rym: That is that is not even the craziest thing that's happened this week.

287
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,215
Rym: But that is the level of craziness.

288
00:18:51,496 --> 00:19:00,190
Rym: the Senate which is responsible for removing the president refuses to take action And the entire justice system is under the control of the White House.

289
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:07,330
Rym: So they can't do anything and the Supreme Court was compromised by two illegally appointed justices, so they can't do anything.

290
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,289
Rym: So we're just stuck right now.

291
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:09,932
Scott: Well, I mean it.

292
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:15,690
Scott: the guest question is if they did the crazy thing and sent the sergeant-at-arms to go and arrest people.

293
00:19:16,673 --> 00:19:17,477
Rym: But there's the crazy thing.

294
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:18,321
Rym: who would they arrest?

295
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:23,753
Rym: Rick Perry and Rudy Giuliani Arrest people.

296
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:25,862
Scott: then what would the Supreme Court say?

297
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:26,584
Scott: That's okay.

298
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:27,910
Rym: Yeah, and then what do we do?

299
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,714
Rym: Is this the house say?

300
00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:31,769
Rym: well no because the Supreme Court is broken like what we don't did.

301
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:34,781
Rym: We're in weird territory and it's only getting weirder.

302
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:38,154
Scott: So the crazy shit that just I want to say is that's great It's never gonna happen.

303
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:41,248
Scott: But if it happens any video of the sergeant-at-arms going hitting someone.

304
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:41,590
Rym: Oh my god.

305
00:19:42,611 --> 00:19:43,557
Scott: Yes, gotta be on video.

306
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:45,630
Scott: Yeah, right hit him with the mace.

307
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:47,915
Scott: So hit him with.

308
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:51,030
Scott: basically it's big by the way, you don't want to get hit with that.

309
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:52,923
Rym: So the house just subpoenaed.

310
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:53,890
Scott: don't look for a picture of it.

311
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,351
Scott: It's scary.

312
00:19:54,713 --> 00:20:00,110
Rym: Rick Perry who is basically an idiot who got appointed to a position where he couldn't do much harm.

313
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:02,202
Scott: So everyone in the election.

314
00:20:02,706 --> 00:20:11,630
Rym: Yeah The problem was the position that they thought he wouldn't do much harm in is the Department of Energy Which if you don't know anything about the US that is one of energy covers a ton of shit.

315
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,298
Scott: Well, not just power-making.

316
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,590
Rym: well, it actually doesn't really cover nuclear weapons.

317
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:19,482
Rym: Energy energy is basically euphemism for fucking nukes.

318
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:21,530
Scott: It's like that's the number one thing they do.

319
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:25,550
Scott: Yeah, they do a lot of other stuff too that is surprisingly unrelated to nukes.

320
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:33,899
Rym: But they basically put this befuddled idiot in charge of it for political reasons and our president Basically just said oh the crime.

321
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:34,260
Rym: I did.

322
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,810
Rym: I did it because that guy told me to Well, that's never an excuse yeah.

323
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:47,500
Rym: But that's the kind of excuse I made when like I pulled a prank on my brother and I got caught I would lie and tell my mom and my brother told me to do it.

324
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,328
Rym: Like that's literally what's going on.

325
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:57,707
Rym: So He got subpoenaed over that Rudy Giuliani the former mayor of New York who is also really crazy.

326
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:00,276
Rym: if you didn't know Well, he was slightly crazy now.

327
00:21:00,316 --> 00:21:01,521
Scott: He became more crazy.

328
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:04,250
Rym: So as far as I have learned he's actually always been this crazy.

329
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:05,097
Rym: Just no one noticed.

330
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,429
Scott: How could he not notice?

331
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,810
Rym: They just didn't because no one no one ever put him on TV long enough to let his crazy out.

332
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:15,560
Rym: it's kind of like Well, there's a lot of people like that.

333
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,769
Rym: where you put him on TV Rym.

334
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:19,450
Rym: My crazy is usually well contained.

335
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:31,483
Rym: But the craziness that just happened is Rudy Giuliani who was already being subpoenaed by the house and is already guilty of like every fucking treason And I always wanted to talk about hitting someone with the fashees.

336
00:21:31,543 --> 00:21:44,980
Rym: I'm really no no, but basically he was doing business with these two dudes who are Ukrainian and appear to be former like Soviet people and They just got arrested at the airport trying to flee the country.

337
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,845
Rym: Mm-hmm for this stuff.

338
00:21:47,346 --> 00:21:58,302
Rym: Mm-hmm by New York Because the New York Attorney General is going after him and apparently that's because the feds Ignored this at despite knowing about it.

339
00:21:58,322 --> 00:21:58,584
Rym: Mm-hmm.

340
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:02,680
Rym: So Crisis is happening amid crisis amid crisis.

341
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,987
Scott: I don't think New York has a fashees to go anyone.

342
00:22:05,168 --> 00:22:09,150
Scott: Yeah Is there a mace at the at the New York like assembly?

343
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:19,389
Rym: What I will tell all of you is that what New York has the mace that New York State and California as a state have In all of this mostly New York because a lot of the stuff happened to have happened in New York.

344
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:27,578
Rym: So the New York like the New York government is actually very important to the federal government for these reasons Because it's very hard to do anything in the u.s.

345
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:33,945
Rym: Without in some point involving, New York City meaning you involve the apparatus of New York State.

346
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:46,330
Rym: so Basically, the reason that's important is that the US president can pardon anyone for anything For federal crimes can't do shit for state crimes.

347
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:48,394
Rym: That's why this is.

348
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:49,679
Rym: that's why New York keeps coming up.

349
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:52,410
Rym: if you were curious the New York Assembly does have a sergeant-at-arms.

350
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:53,756
Scott: It's Wayne who.

351
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:56,990
Scott: it's Wayne P. Jackson, I don't know if Wayne P. Jackson has a mace.

352
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,560
Rym: I wonder if we could interview Wayne P. Jackson on GeekNights and Looks like a cool person.

353
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:03,048
Rym: I I will.

354
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:05,193
Scott: this is Jackson's LinkedIn page.

355
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:15,673
Rym: I'm gonna try to interview the depart the sergeant-at-arms of the New York Assembly on GeekNights like He has been the sergeant-at-arms at the New York State Assembly Since.

356
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:20,170
Scott: but when do you think oh my god, when do you think Wayne P. Jackson became?

357
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:24,050
Scott: This without looking it up of the New York State is a listener can see my screen.

358
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,155
Rym: They can say I can't look in this up.

359
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:26,904
Rym: You wouldn't ask unless it was really good.

360
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:33,236
Scott: I'm gonna say since 1968 you're way too early 1979 40 years.

361
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:34,663
Scott: Whoa in that job.

362
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:36,250
Rym: I really want to talk to this guy now.

363
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,650
Rym: That's the kind of person no one interviews connected them on LinkedIn.

364
00:23:38,912 --> 00:23:39,678
Rym: I will I will.

365
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,190
Rym: I will try to talk to this person.

366
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:45,930
Rym: That would be because we haven't interviewed anyone in GeekNights and for fucking acted assembly sergeant-at-arms.

367
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,842
Scott: It's 40 years in chamber daily news.

368
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:48,345
Rym: Wow.

369
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:51,688
Scott: All right Person didn't even know a Vietnam vet.

370
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:57,710
Rym: So in some other news, that's also terrifying and actually really important and people don't seem to realize what's happening here.

371
00:23:58,212 --> 00:24:02,350
Rym: I'm gonna broadly summarize because I want to get down to like our actual main bed, but here's the deal.

372
00:24:02,872 --> 00:24:04,600
Rym: There's this power company in California.

373
00:24:05,183 --> 00:24:07,072
Rym: They caused the one of the day I heard.

374
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:15,268
Scott: all I heard was that there's power outages in California And I know that the power company in California is called PG&E which stands for Pacific Gas and Electric, right?

375
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:16,937
Scott: Yeah Yeah, that's all I knew.

376
00:24:16,978 --> 00:24:18,849
Scott: I didn't know anything and then Rym went off on it.

377
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,993
Rym: Yeah, the holy shit.

378
00:24:20,013 --> 00:24:25,630
Rym: So remember that giant wildfire that killed like 90 people destroyed an entire town.

379
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,684
Scott: I thought that's always from like some dirt derpy derp in the woods.

380
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:29,910
Scott: No smokey the bear.

381
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:33,150
Rym: No, this was the deadliest wildfire in the history of the state, right?

382
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,710
Scott: I know that those are always caused by no derpy.

383
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:42,390
Rym: No, this one was caused by PG&E has the most dilapidated piece of shit power infrastructure in America.

384
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,614
Scott: Well, California is pretty big.

385
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:58,200
Scott: It's hard to you know, this is like this company is like so negligent Allegedly allegedly allegedly, I'm not a lawyer, you know, isn't this why you always have like those helicopters the chainsaws on the bottom Cutting down the trees and bridges near the power line.

386
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:09,343
Rym: Rather than open myself up to any possible definite I'm just gonna read this BuzzFeed article this paragraph here PG&E Filed for bankruptcy in January in the face of legal claims.

387
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:11,310
Scott: How could the power company be bankrupt?

388
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,550
Scott: Are they like not charging enough on the electric bills?

389
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:26,202
Rym: They're bankrupt because to continue reading in the face of legal claims running into billions of dollars after they got sued for the Fire because their power lines were found were triggered.

390
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:37,929
Rym: the November 2018 campfire Which destroyed the town of Paradise killed 85 people destroyed almost 20,000 buildings the deadliest wildfire in New York State history, New York I keep saying New York, California State history.

391
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:41,504
Scott: So that liability and losing the lawsuit is.

392
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:44,481
Rym: and because they're a private company They were like we're bankrupt.

393
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,589
Rym: You can't do shit to us now.

394
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:50,230
Rym: Okay, because that's how that works because they're a private company is bankrupt.

395
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,541
Rym: The power companies bankrupt because they killed a lot of people and destroyed a town.

396
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:56,030
Rym: right because they're negligent to an extreme degree.

397
00:25:57,011 --> 00:26:00,449
Rym: So they still are the entity providing power during all this.

398
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:03,630
Scott: Yeah, I mean bankrupt companies continue to operate depending on the chapter.

399
00:26:03,871 --> 00:26:07,848
Rym: yeah, and basically what's happening is they have said because of.

400
00:26:08,852 --> 00:26:16,682
Rym: Well because of climate change and the fact that there's this huge drought really hot weather and Really strong winds in California was over a while ago.

401
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,310
Rym: No, there's still drought stuff going on.

402
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:24,750
Rym: Okay, that the state is at a huge huge risk of like way worse wildfires.

403
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:25,498
Scott: Well, I don't live there.

404
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:28,714
Scott: one of the reasons, uh Earthquake fall into the sea.

405
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:38,470
Rym: this power company their power lines bears would if a wildfire happened There's a good chance is because these power lines caused it because they're so old and shitty because they've already caused wildfires.

406
00:26:39,152 --> 00:26:49,099
Rym: so the only way to prevent these wildfires right now because this company is such a piece of shit is for this company to Cut off power to everyone.

407
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,093
Rym: They're just turning off the power for maybe weeks We don't know.

408
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,703
Scott: it seems like maybe the problem is even like we're even.

409
00:26:55,803 --> 00:26:58,530
Scott: obviously if you had Mel maintain power lines It would be less of an issue.

410
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,310
Rym: This would not be an issue with well-maintained power.

411
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:05,530
Scott: But also it seems like another solution might be just to like not run power lines through the fucking woods.

412
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:09,466
Scott: No, it's have more power plants that no every town.

413
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:11,716
Rym: no No, I do.

414
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:15,350
Rym: I do not even have the energy to get into you with this.

415
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,141
Scott: This can hold fucking trees, right?

416
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:19,848
Scott: Uh, and and burn down.

417
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:23,462
Rym: guys Why do you think we use high-tension power lines in the first place?

418
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:25,130
Scott: Cuz you don't have too many power plants are expensive.

419
00:27:25,593 --> 00:27:28,330
Rym: Uh, why do you think we have a national power grid?

420
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,108
Scott: Because you got a lot of electricity you got a you know, you got to use it all.

421
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:38,546
Rym: The problem here is that these power lines are necessary and should be well maintained.

422
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:43,520
Rym: because they are so poorly maintained They are likely to start wildfires due to these extreme weather conditions.

423
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:50,360
Rym: So the only way to prevent those wildfires right now is To cut off power to potentially millions of people.

424
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:53,029
Scott: I guess it'll be really easy to maintain them if they're not powered up.

425
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:54,815
Rym: They're not going to.

426
00:27:54,835 --> 00:27:58,689
Rym: they're just gonna leave the power off until the wildfire conditions aren't that bad?

427
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:03,606
Rym: Yeah The only actually yeah, so here's what I'm getting at.

428
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:05,493
Scott: you're blaming But yeah You don't live in.

429
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:10,493
Rym: if you want to read the stories to find out all these details because we're not journalists here I'm just.

430
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:12,209
Rym: my point is much more simple.

431
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:16,462
Rym: There should not be private power companies anywhere in the United States.

432
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:18,689
Scott: I'll be a private utility anyway.

433
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:30,328
Rym: power water Internet should be utilities provided by the government housing health care mail Transportation I'm getting there all those.

434
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:32,168
Scott: And then I think that's all of them.

435
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:33,193
Rym: Housing.

436
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:40,929
Rym: I I think there is okay to have a private housing market with the caveat that in dense places like New York City There should not be private ownership of residential properties.

437
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:42,215
Scott: I think there should also.

438
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:45,770
Scott: there should be sufficient public housing that no one should be without a house.

439
00:28:46,312 --> 00:28:47,877
Scott: There can also be private housing.

440
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:51,310
Rym: Yeah, but I'm but it depends on the area like in New York City.

441
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:54,750
Rym: I do not think there should be private ownership of any residential property.

442
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:59,047
Rym: But in like bumblefuck sure you can own some little land with a house on it.

443
00:28:59,088 --> 00:28:59,630
Scott: the point is no.

444
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,067
Scott: Every anyone who needs a house.

445
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:03,495
Rym: Here's the broader point.

446
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:11,850
Rym: people who like to point at countries like Venezuela Or they used to point at the Soviet Union be like, oh look their power infrastructure is failing.

447
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,810
Rym: Look at the fucking United States.

448
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:18,846
Rym: This is a ridiculous disaster of a story that is now being talked about as much as it should be.

449
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:19,689
Rym: this should be well.

450
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:26,150
Rym: This would be front page in every newspaper if it weren't for the fact that we're in the middle of our ninth constitutional crisis.

451
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,897
Rym: Yeah, so pay attention to the story.

452
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,181
Scott: New York doesn't have these problems.

453
00:29:33,341 --> 00:29:36,169
Rym: yeah, meanwhile Scott actually has a non depressing news.

454
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:44,515
Scott: Okay, I mean so if you want to impress somebody this week and you live somewhere, that's not New York City That's not covered in light pollution.

455
00:29:44,555 --> 00:29:52,954
Scott: You can actually see the other habitable planets in this universe and gal Galaxy that are not the earth Someplace or her.

456
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:55,223
Scott: maybe maybe bad things aren't happening.

457
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:56,769
Scott: Maybe worse things are happening who knows?

458
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:57,311
Rym: yeah They're not.

459
00:29:57,331 --> 00:30:03,030
Rym: just might be genocidal warfare and butlerian jahads and a eyes and what's going on out there.

460
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:16,267
Scott: But if you were live somewhere where you can see that there is gonna be Fuck the fuck crazy amounts of fucking meteor showers and shooting stars real soon I think there's like the Draconid meteor or whatever.

461
00:30:16,307 --> 00:30:18,718
Rym: they're gonna be Back-to-back nights.

462
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:33,110
Scott: yeah the southern torrid one It's like basically all these meteor showers are gonna be like at peak meteor shower activity Same time all up in yep, so the Draconid is already peak.

463
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:38,620
Scott: So I'm someone who doesn't know that's gonna happen and be like Scott You're a magician or that you're gonna.

464
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,705
Scott: You know be like oh, man.

465
00:30:39,725 --> 00:30:45,038
Rym: Whatever shooting star shows up The Draconids peaked two nights ago, that's already passed.

466
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:46,181
Scott: well there you go.

467
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:48,126
Rym: the southern torrid peaked last night.

468
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:49,429
Rym: that also already passed.

469
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:52,235
Scott: well It's still pretty high activity though.

470
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:57,086
Rym: Yeah, but the Pete with the peaks already happened in both of these stories old.

471
00:30:57,466 --> 00:31:00,298
Scott: Oh, no I Mean I can't blame me.

472
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,989
Scott: I was moving and I can't see the sky.

473
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,930
Rym: This is literally the second paragraph of the article.

474
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,300
Scott: I didn't read the dates one two.

475
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:09,630
Scott: it was on Google News as like a new story.

476
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:13,710
Rym: I don't think you read the fourth or fifth sentence of this article.

477
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,578
Scott: When was the article posted though?

478
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:25,983
Rym: I don't know, but it was updated yesterday 730 p.m.. Yeah, see so anyway Okay, so I hope you saw those meteor showers.

479
00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:29,760
Scott: I mean that was only the peak though You'll probably still see some crazy meteor action.

480
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:31,730
Rym: Maybe I don't know that much about him.

481
00:31:32,212 --> 00:31:32,995
Scott: I mean you know it's like.

482
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:35,485
Scott: I assume if it peaks that it's not just like what you know.

483
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:36,530
Scott: there's still lots of you know.

484
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:38,284
Scott: It's just not at the peak activity.

485
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:39,090
Scott: It's that slightly less.

486
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:42,189
Rym: I'm sure the listener will tell us more about that.

487
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:43,216
Scott: I think it also depends.

488
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:45,370
Scott: you got to be in the right place on earth to see them right.

489
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,450
Scott: I think if you're like maybe in the Arizona area you might see them better.

490
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:55,510
Rym: Yeah, well the tricky part too is living in New York City the sky see shit like it does not get dark here.

491
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:01,430
Rym: No Like to the point that the the park near a house like the lights are a nice power outage would help us out.

492
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,502
Rym: Like right now the lights are all broken.

493
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:04,790
Scott: go start a wildfire upstate.

494
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,538
Scott: So they'll turn off the power and we can see the sky.

495
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:16,442
Rym: because I'm actually kind of okay because New York City is so Relatively dense and small that I'm kind of okay with the fact that it just kind of always lit here Because it's such a tiny geographic area.

496
00:32:16,462 --> 00:32:17,185
Rym: That's always lit.

497
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:18,955
Rym: hmm You can't.

498
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:20,950
Rym: there's no way to avoid that with a city like this.

499
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:22,714
Scott: Turn off the fucking lights.

500
00:32:23,215 --> 00:32:23,536
Rym: What do you mean?

501
00:32:23,556 --> 00:32:25,443
Rym: turn off the lights at night then?

502
00:32:25,503 --> 00:32:26,466
Rym: no then no one could see.

503
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,024
Rym: yeah stay fucking Side I go outside at night all the time.

504
00:32:30,326 --> 00:32:30,950
Scott: Don't go to bed.

505
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:32,995
Scott: See this guy.

506
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:34,240
Scott: I'm always shocked though.

507
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:42,150
Scott: I do see like on the High Line and other places There are like you know Astronomy clubs like in New York that do like sky watching like what the fuck are you looking at the moon?

508
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:42,692
Scott: And that's it.

509
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:48,836
Scott: you can occasionally see some stuff here like it's like moon Venus Jupiter They're looking at.

510
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:51,690
Rym: all you got to do is go a little bit upstate and you can see every goddamn star.

511
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,501
Scott: That's right, but why are they on the High Line Nancy and Jack?

512
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:55,444
Rym: Yeah?

513
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:55,986
Rym: I do not know.

514
00:32:56,006 --> 00:33:10,904
Scott: maybe there's looking at the moon I Maybe they're looking in some windows seems people shooting rooms But anyway things of the day.

515
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:12,149
Rym: so check this out.

516
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:14,837
Rym: Borax is actually a really important thing.

517
00:33:15,378 --> 00:33:16,662
Rym: I use borax now.

518
00:33:16,963 --> 00:33:19,630
Rym: people use borax for a long stretch of human history.

519
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:33,997
Scott: I only ever used borax in not even school but in Like summer program where I was doing science II stuff, and we made play-doh of the borax and that's good play-doh The good way to use borax.

520
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:35,322
Scott: also you got to be careful when you do it.

521
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:37,550
Rym: No borax is like super safe.

522
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:39,965
Scott: No, no, no, I mean like you know I'm making the play-doh.

523
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:40,670
Rym: Yeah, I gotta be careful.

524
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,860
Rym: I made that play-doh there that play-doh.

525
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,000
Rym: if you fuck up you can hurt yourself a little bit, but borax is a cool thing.

526
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:53,342
Rym: that's really really useful and It's really heavy and to use it like in an industrial capacity.

527
00:33:53,362 --> 00:33:54,867
Rym: You need a lot of it.

528
00:33:55,449 --> 00:34:00,407
Rym: so Borax has been collected and transported for a long long time.

529
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:10,917
Rym: and To make a long story short because I don't want to get into the history of borax Now, but I will get into it to the future because it's a topic that I'm actually Weirdly interested in and know more about than I should.

530
00:34:11,438 --> 00:34:23,429
Rym: but anyway this video shows how the old wagons That had to each be able to carry like a thousand pounds of borax in an era when you made wagons out of wood.

531
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:31,949
Rym: This is people making 600 pound tires With 300 pound hubs to put on these gigantic wooden wagons.

532
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:41,541
Rym: And it is really cool and fascinating to see how with relatively simple tools You can make these insane wheels well tires technically mm-hmm.

533
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:42,623
Rym: It's a really good video.

534
00:34:42,643 --> 00:34:44,688
Rym: It's like a half hour long cuz it's.

535
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:49,281
Rym: uh You know people talk about like machine porn or manufacturing porn.

536
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:50,866
Rym: This is woodworking porn.

537
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,677
Scott: It's really good Was my thing today.

538
00:34:53,737 --> 00:34:56,069
Scott: Oh, yeah, so we all know.

539
00:34:57,114 --> 00:34:58,541
Scott: I hope you know about the.

540
00:34:58,903 --> 00:35:03,624
Scott: you know the the history of The gender reveal party basically the story straight.

541
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,750
Rym: people had a terrible idea.

542
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:15,210
Scott: One person came up with this idea and like articles are written about it And they basically had a party and at the part if you don't know maybe it's not a thing outside America But I hope it's not a thing outside of America.

543
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:19,430
Scott: They had a little party because they had a baby and they wanted to like sort of be like surprise.

544
00:35:19,732 --> 00:35:25,750
Scott: It's a boy slash girl right by You know cutting a cake or something and like the inside of the cake is pink or blue.

545
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:38,689
Scott: Or you pop a balloon and pink or blue confetti comes out like you have some interesting way Some mechanism by which you you know surprise reveal what the whether the baby is you know?

546
00:35:39,711 --> 00:35:40,615
Scott: Has a penis or not?

547
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:49,153
Rym: yeah now obviously there's already a problem here because that only determines biological sex within a spectrum something that only You know.

548
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:59,769
Scott: straight bad people who are old way thinking would think to do and obviously all Right thinking people like us realize how stupid and bad this is etc.

549
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:09,298
Scott: It's ironic that the first baby who was revealed at that first gender reveal party is Like a girl who wears suits.

550
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,970
Scott: I guess is not a not a straight person at all.

551
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:17,470
Scott: And also the person who had that first party kind of regrets it and wish it didn't become a thing.

552
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:18,927
Rym: Yeah, this trend has gotten weird.

553
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:23,322
Rym: in fact There's a big story about a huge wildfire caused by a gender reveal gone wrong.

554
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:24,645
Rym: right a lot.

555
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:32,213
Rym: a lot of Hicks are using guns And explosives in their gender reveals anyway, so there was a really great Gender.

556
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:37,190
Scott: whenever gender reveals go wrong or it hilarious stuff gets posted on the internet.

557
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:40,823
Scott: So here are people they got a black balloon because obviously it's opaque.

558
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:42,930
Scott: you can't see what's inside must be from Toronto.

559
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:47,470
Scott: Maybe they're trying to smash you know pinata the giant black balloon.

560
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:53,910
Scott: Supposedly something will come out of the balloon revealing the gender of the or the the sex of the baby.

561
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:59,746
Rym: But apparently instead the baby's gender or sex was revealed to be the sex of the baby, but they're saying gender.

562
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:00,388
Scott: They're wrong.

563
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:05,641
Scott: Yeah and It's awesome video because they totally fail.

564
00:37:06,063 --> 00:37:17,299
Rym: they fail so badly And the response to it is wonderful because either the baby's sex is the sky or the black balloon or has escaped the gender binary.

565
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,600
Scott: right yeah this the comments and there the Retweets with quote on this.

566
00:37:22,761 --> 00:37:26,157
Scott: not the video is excellent on its own But the videos like a Renaissance.

567
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:32,078
Rym: you know that video where the the golf cart on the football field like runs away And you like you watch this like drama unfold.

568
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:35,710
Rym: It's similar in scale to that in terms of how badly it goes for them.

569
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:38,205
Scott: Yep, and then an additional.

570
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:41,544
Scott: I have a second Addendum thing of the day, it's sort of.

571
00:37:41,745 --> 00:37:50,189
Scott: it's not from the onion But it's from an onion II kind of site with a fake story, and it's basically like oh, yeah Adventurers have alignment reveal.

572
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:53,348
Rym: He's chaotic evil.

573
00:37:56,912 --> 00:37:57,876
Scott: It's chaotic evil.

574
00:37:57,896 --> 00:37:59,645
Scott: yeah, it's not a sex reveal party.

575
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:05,803
Rym: is yeah alignment only In The meta moment the GeekNights booklet book remains the tale of Genji.

576
00:38:06,265 --> 00:38:09,929
Rym: as the weather gets worse and worse We're more likely a new.

577
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:11,958
Scott: There was a discovery.

578
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:13,930
Rym: I was gonna bring this up, and you beat me to it.

579
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,395
Rym: So do we have to include that now?

580
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:17,784
Rym:  no, okay, okay?

581
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:25,110
Scott: We are going to read the The penguin deluxe unabridged tale of Genji once got linked to on the website.

582
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:26,678
Scott: Yes, the one that is linked on the website.

583
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:27,402
Scott: That's the addition.

584
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:28,850
Scott: We are going to be discussing.

585
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,179
Scott: I'm sure you probably won't be lost in the discussion.

586
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:41,063
Scott: you read some other version, but regardless that's the version We're gonna read, but yeah, they found another like Section of the book that was written different members all written by hand.

587
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:47,060
Scott: It's not like they had printing press copy machines And it had different wordings of a section.

588
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:49,729
Scott: and no you know I got to translate that biz.

589
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:51,983
Scott: so yeah They discovered some more tale of Genji.

590
00:38:52,003 --> 00:38:56,968
Rym: yep You do not have to read that additional tale of Genji to do our book club.

591
00:38:56,988 --> 00:38:59,254
Scott: Don't worry We'll see how significant it is.

592
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:07,014
Rym: I'm sure soon yep, and otherwise we will be live at PAX Unplugged doing not one But two events.

593
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:22,130
Rym: one of those events is actually three mini events meaning We're doing four things that PAX Unplugged other than playing tabletop games for the entire time never stopping That's right, so we will be doing a brand new panel that I'm really excited about.

594
00:39:22,372 --> 00:39:27,469
Rym: We've been wanting to do this one at a packs for a while But PAX Unplugged is like the perfect place to do it.

595
00:39:27,771 --> 00:39:30,643
Rym: We're doing a panel called take your fucking turn.

596
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:32,229
Scott: is it called take your fucking?

597
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:36,390
Rym: well It's it's called take your a bunch of characters turn.

598
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:42,942
Rym: Okay Because the panel is we're going to talk about Why people don't take their turn in board games how to take.

599
00:39:42,962 --> 00:39:44,770
Rym: we're gonna teach you how to take your turn fast.

600
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:50,730
Rym: We're gonna talk about game design and sociology and all the things that cause people to not take their turns fast.

601
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:53,640
Scott: Also games being slow games yelling.

602
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,610
Scott: sometimes some games slower faster than others.

603
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,834
Rym: Yeah, I'd like to give you a preview.

604
00:39:58,156 --> 00:40:00,464
Rym: some tires faster slow and others sometimes.

605
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:01,428
Rym: It's the players fault.

606
00:40:01,669 --> 00:40:03,097
Rym: sometimes It's the game's fault.

607
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:04,727
Scott: It's the game's fault more often than you think.

608
00:40:04,928 --> 00:40:06,859
Scott: yep Not to say it's never the players fault.

609
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:13,826
Rym: some games could be fast But if a certain player is a certain way the game will be ruined and be extra slow.

610
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:19,787
Scott: some games All right are fast or slow depending on details like oh we played Dominion.

611
00:40:19,827 --> 00:40:23,238
Scott: it took two seconds Again curses or everybody.

612
00:40:23,278 --> 00:40:24,642
Scott: well takes forever.

613
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:28,754
Rym: Yeah, I've been down down that road before yep Or even our space train game.

614
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:33,170
Rym: that game might have actually gone a lot faster if we had rusted those spaceships earlier.

615
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:35,757
Rym: Yep, so some games have time traps in them.

616
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:37,282
Rym: so brand brand new.

617
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:38,525
Rym: talk first time ever.

618
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,391
Rym: so be fun to see how this one Goes.

619
00:40:40,652 --> 00:40:44,929
Rym: and then we'll be doing a. learn to play and win where we're gonna teach you how to learn and win.

620
00:40:45,354 --> 00:40:48,378
Rym: Cockroach poker Play learn.

621
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:49,589
Rym: we're gonna teach you the game.

622
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:58,434
Rym: We're gonna teach you how to win the game, and then we're going to all play the game together cockroach poker Ganshan clever and Wizard.

623
00:40:58,595 --> 00:41:01,210
Scott: we can only teach people how to win the first one in the third one.

624
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,718
Scott: I don't know how to win Ganshan clever.

625
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:04,266
Scott: I I can't even get to.

626
00:41:04,286 --> 00:41:05,814
Scott: that's pretty clever I think.

627
00:41:05,955 --> 00:41:12,228
Rym: actually what I'm gonna teach people how to win in Ganshan clever is Learn how to win Yahtzee and just apply those skills as best you can.

628
00:41:12,248 --> 00:41:15,324
Scott: yeah I think I don't think we were qualified to help you how to win that game.

629
00:41:15,344 --> 00:41:16,310
Scott: Yeah, it's too hard.

630
00:41:16,732 --> 00:41:22,322
Rym: We were gonna give some previews of our current early Heuristics of how to play that game that we have not vetted thoroughly.

631
00:41:22,342 --> 00:41:24,010
Scott: why don't we find an expert and get their advice?

632
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,887
Rym: Why don't we just play the game like a hundred times before packs unplug?

633
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:27,290
Rym: We got a lot?

634
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:27,954
Rym: We got some time.

635
00:41:27,994 --> 00:41:28,477
Scott: come on over.

636
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:29,021

Rym: I'm game.

638
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:31,811

Rym: We will return to a pack sauce someday Mm-hmm.

643
00:41:55,855 --> 00:41:58,230
Rym: I'm vaguely planning on returning to pack sauce.

644
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:07,890
Rym: I don't know if you want to come not next year because I'm going to Japan But if not the year after next year then almost definitely the year after the year after the next year meaning the following year.

00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:09,356
Scott: Did you know that the in?

00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,310
Rym: We can put every packs here and make the packs dashboard.

664
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:01,723
Scott: We don't need them.

665
00:43:02,753 --> 00:43:06,490
Scott: Anyway, actually I use this site a lot because what the fuck day and time is it in Melbourne?

670
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:24,473
Rym: I will link to world time buddy though because I've noticed if you are the kind of person who is like I said It's 10 a.m.

671
00:43:24,513 --> 00:43:24,934
Scott: On Friday.

672
00:43:24,974 --> 00:43:34,709
Scott: in fact packs awesome is gonna start in eight minutes from right now when I'm recording this I guess anyone watching live on YouTube is getting waiting in line to get into the pack saws.

673
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:38,810
Rym: Yep, all I gotta say is if you were there liberate Hong Kong revolution of our time.

674
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,076
Rym: So let's get into this moving.

675
00:43:43,116 --> 00:43:56,724
Scott: we did a show about moving when we 2006 right cuz we moved to beacon in 2004 five ish and started GeekNights not too long after in October.

676
00:43:56,805 --> 00:44:03,748
Scott: oh five it's currently October 19 so GeekNights is 14 years old which is terrifying in its own right.

677
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:14,544
Rym: in fact We are coming up because GeekNights started on October 31st 2005. that was the first published public episode of GeekNights.

678
00:44:14,925 --> 00:44:16,670
Rym: We're coming up on our 15th fucking year

679
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:18,059
Scott: 15th year okay,

680
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:18,421
Rym: yeah,

681
00:44:18,904 --> 00:44:28,098
Scott: anyway the point is We did a show around then about moving because we had recently moved from Rochester to beacon

682
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:36,490
Rym: and that was in fact the first like Full move of a house or apartment that I had ever done where it wasn't like my family moving.

683
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:37,333
Scott: It was on you.

684
00:44:37,353 --> 00:44:38,257
Rym: It was on me.

685
00:44:38,277 --> 00:44:39,401
Scott: It was really on me.

686
00:44:40,024 --> 00:44:42,293
Rym: Yeah, well I had a lot of shit I had to move to.

687
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:46,510
Scott: my parents only helped me the tiniest bit when I moved stuff out of colony and into a storage box.

688
00:44:47,092 --> 00:44:48,358
Rym: Yep, and I just I didn't.

689
00:44:48,398 --> 00:44:50,488
Rym: I just packed all my shit in a car and drove it to Poughkeepsie.

690
00:44:50,508 --> 00:44:51,877
Scott: at one point You had a lot less shit.

691
00:44:51,937 --> 00:44:52,582
Scott: I guess I don't know.

692
00:44:52,603 --> 00:44:55,983
Scott: yeah all that furniture There's no didn't you drive it all to the beach first.

693
00:44:56,706 --> 00:44:59,720
Rym: I drove everything I owned except my furniture to Wild World.

694
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,086
Rym: I drove it to Lansing, Michigan.

695
00:45:01,186 --> 00:45:02,653
Rym: actually all right Right right.

696
00:45:02,955 --> 00:45:11,030
Rym: then I drove it a few days later from Lansing, Michigan to Wildwood Left it in my car in Wildwood for like a month, and then I drove it anyway.

697
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:12,878
Scott: Be on that show.

698
00:45:13,382 --> 00:45:20,785
Rym: to that point when I drove that car I couldn't see out any windows But the front and my left window and I had a monitor that was precariously balanced.

699
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:22,470
Scott: next to the point is I did that show.

700
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,990
Scott: We only talked about that move specifically.

701
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:29,063
Scott: We did not talk about moving as a general topic and also we were young.

702
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:41,009
Rym: we probably did an episode about moving in general But Rym probably deleted it yep But we were also young and dumb so we had some ideas about moving and the way we handled the move was definitely colored by The fact that we didn't know a lot about it.

703
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:43,783
Rym: We wanted to do it all ourselves because we're stupid.

704
00:45:43,804 --> 00:45:45,773
Rym: a lot of money Yeah, we did.

705
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:57,004
Rym: we still spent a lot of money despite not wanting to spend a lot of money nearly as much money As much as now yep, but that truck was not cheap No, and also that truck was way too big and I was not qualified to drive a truck.

706
00:45:57,044 --> 00:45:58,870
Scott: that big right all right.

707
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,601
Scott: So uh so I'm moving.

708
00:46:00,662 --> 00:46:03,496
Scott: so you live in one place You want to live in another place.

709
00:46:03,536 --> 00:46:07,510
Scott: my first piece of advice to you is don't own so much shit like I do.

710
00:46:07,691 --> 00:46:14,789
Scott: Yes, if you don't have a lot of shit You can just fucking get your ass up and go the fuck anywhere and life is great if you have an excuse.

711
00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:18,149
Rym: if you were Moving because you're forced to you're because you want to it doesn't matter.

712
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:24,710
Rym: Consider moving an excuse to look at everything you own and try to get rid of as much of it as possible.

713
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:25,232
Rym: That's right.

714
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:27,401
Scott: Don't be like me and have too much nerdy shit.

715
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:28,324
Scott: You can't let go of.

716
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:35,130
Scott: I'm not at the hoarder level Right like some people, but I do have enough shit to where it is a burden.

717
00:46:35,513 --> 00:46:37,770
Scott: But I cannot part with most of it.

718
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:41,886
Scott: I just started with a nice hefty piles, but I still have.

719
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:50,340
Rym: I just looked up And I have a. I have a shelf for all the like batteries for all the like video GeekNights stuff And I just noticed I have a battery for a camera.

720
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,544
Rym: I have not owned in years.

721
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:51,946
Rym: Yep.

722
00:46:52,408 --> 00:46:53,030
Scott: That's the kind of thing.

723
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:55,721
Scott: It's the kind of thing you would throw out if you moved.

724
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:57,310
Rym: I'm gonna give this to you.

725
00:46:57,431 --> 00:46:59,312
Rym: You could use this battery for that camera I gave you.

726
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:02,269
Scott: when you're just living in a place you don't notice a thing like that.

727
00:47:02,914 --> 00:47:05,210
Scott: And maybe you do notice and you say I'll take care of that later.

728
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:12,870
Rym: But if you have to get all your shit out of every place you've squirreled it away for a decade and put it into boxes You immediately realize that you own way too much shit, right?

729
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,381
Scott: So if you follow that advice, you don't own too much shit.

730
00:47:15,602 --> 00:47:17,510
Scott: moving is like a fucking piece of cake, right?

731
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:21,165
Scott: You just take the little shit you have rent like one the smallest.

732
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:24,557
Scott: you haul at most Right and you put everything in.

733
00:47:24,597 --> 00:47:28,870
Scott: you go to the new place you end one lease you start another lease you sign a mortgage.

734
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:32,377
Scott: That's not part of this episode Right and you put all the shit in it.

735
00:47:32,457 --> 00:47:35,186
Scott: It'll take you a day or maybe some transportation time.

736
00:47:35,588 --> 00:47:36,290
Scott: Not a big deal.

737
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:37,476
Scott: You don't need to hire help.

738
00:47:37,516 --> 00:47:38,762
Scott: You don't need to really do much.

739
00:47:39,225 --> 00:47:40,330
Scott: life is grand, right?

740
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:45,447
Scott: So moving is really only a topic we're discussing for people who got too much stuff.

741
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:49,649
Rym: Yep No, even if you don't have too much stuff moving is still kind of a pain in the ass.

742
00:47:50,272 --> 00:47:54,190
Rym: Cuz even if I do not have too much is the less stuff you have?

743
00:47:54,594 --> 00:47:59,038
Scott: moving becomes Exponentially easier and yell more stuff you have.

744
00:47:59,399 --> 00:48:02,970
Scott: it becomes exponentially more difficult with each added stuff.

745
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:16,915
Rym: yep, the other very important thing that I learned from all these moves that I didn't quite internalize until I was older is Every time you move you pretty much just throw away any IKEA furniture you have Survive.

746
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:18,927
Scott: I saved the bookcases.

747
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:22,790
Rym: Oh nice And a lot of my IKEA furniture.

748
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,401
Scott: What IKEA furniture survived?

749
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:28,916
Scott: none other than the book other than Billy bookcases I saved.

750
00:48:28,936 --> 00:48:29,719
Scott: I think.

751
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,230
Scott: no IKEA furniture that comes to mind.

752
00:48:32,396 --> 00:48:33,989
Scott: Yeah I my bed I had.

753
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:37,058
Scott: My junk collectors came and smashed up the bed and took it.

754
00:48:37,399 --> 00:48:39,886
Scott: the dresser also taken away by junk collectors.

755
00:48:39,926 --> 00:48:41,190
Scott: the desk gone.

756
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:55,236
Scott: Oh the the wheelie a file cabinet that came with the desk was actually still is in great condition But I bought a Newer better IKEA file a cabinet thing That's just superior.

757
00:48:55,617 --> 00:48:59,290
Scott: and now the old one is rolling around my new apartment empty and will be disposed of soon.

758
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,385
Rym: So what's interesting is I was once one.

759
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:07,070
Rym: Let me know I have all these memories because as a kid like you've lived in pretty much the same house your whole childhood.

760
00:49:07,171 --> 00:49:09,920
Rym: But we actually move my house The.

761
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:17,213
Scott: I lived in three places But only one of them was a place I lived in from like the ages of like 2 to 18.

762
00:49:17,213 --> 00:49:20,830
Scott: So my memories of the other two places are zero and minuscule.

763
00:49:21,172 --> 00:49:21,816
Rym: See I was born in.

764
00:49:21,897 --> 00:49:23,630
Rym: I was born in Detroit like the house on Berkshire.

765
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,193
Rym: I'm trying to run.

766
00:49:24,274 --> 00:49:30,989
Rym: so I was born in this house in Berkshire, which I remember Barely, but I have these vague memories of this house.

767
00:49:31,492 --> 00:49:37,810
Rym: Then we moved to a rental house like really temporarily during another move And then we moved to the house on Harvard also in Detroit.

768
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:49,413
Rym: Then we moved to Anchor Bay like New Baltimore for a while, then we moved to sterling heights And in sterling heights, we're actually looking at buying a different house in the same town and moving to that house But we didn't actually do it.

769
00:49:50,176 --> 00:49:54,329
Rym: Then I moved to RIT and that was when I brought way too much shit with me.

770
00:49:55,671 --> 00:50:03,050
Rym: Then we moved to the apartment in colony and then after living there for a while They kicked us out for a summer and we had to move back into that place.

771
00:50:03,698 --> 00:50:04,548
Rym: That was a pain in the ass.

772
00:50:05,091 --> 00:50:06,095
Rym: Then we moved to Beacon.

773
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:10,551
Rym: then we both split into the apartments in New York and then you moved to a new apartment in New York.

774
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:13,627
Rym: so I moved a bunch of times in my life as a kid.

775
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,939
Rym: Doesn't matter moving is just awesome when you're a kid.

776
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:28,888
Rym: the adults were super stressed every time Like movers were coming and packing stuff up and strangers were in the house and we're like taking things apart And I just remember enjoying every second of it and reveling in the chaos.

777
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:31,984
Scott: Yeah There's a lot of things that go on moving as a kid, right?

778
00:50:32,004 --> 00:50:33,110
Scott: It's like new school.

779
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:37,350
Scott: Yeah, so as I can it can up end all that stuff, but I've never experienced that.

780
00:50:38,677 --> 00:50:40,870
Scott: I've experienced it through the media and through other people.

781
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:45,550
Rym: What was really interesting is that just by chance my brother got a lot more of that disruption.

782
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:52,308
Rym: But based on my age I every time we moved was at a clear like separation point between one type of school and another.

783
00:50:52,629 --> 00:50:56,530
Rym: we moved Right at the end of elementary school as I was going into middle school.

784
00:50:56,871 --> 00:50:59,139
Rym: We moved at the end of middle school as I was going into high school.

785
00:50:59,842 --> 00:51:01,990
Rym: So it made it like really really easy.

786
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:10,090
Scott: I mean, I did semi experience it right like, you know times were like I changed like even when I change schools It's still in the same town, but it was like a lot of new people.

787
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:16,001
Scott: It was almost like, you know, oh, we were like really new towns every time I even though I was in the same house at home.

788
00:51:16,081 --> 00:51:17,005
Scott: that didn't move right?

789
00:51:18,331 --> 00:51:18,901
Scott: It's still.

790
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:24,590
Scott: you know I still had that social upheaval by switching a school or like switching a summer camp stuff like that.

791
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,857
Scott: No, you know experiencing the new people thing.

792
00:51:27,078 --> 00:51:27,278
Scott: Yep.

793
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:30,890
Scott: I could just imagine moving being sort of like that with the school situation.

794
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:40,210
Rym: Yep, and I have all these just vague kid memories of like the adults packing and everyone point I was carrying around a two-liter bottle of cream soda and just drinking from it.

795
00:51:40,772 --> 00:51:42,923
Rym: And I don't think my parents knew I had this bottle.

796
00:51:43,043 --> 00:51:44,329
Rym: and then I was drinking the whole thing.

797
00:51:44,911 --> 00:51:58,960
Rym: And I just remember like watching these movers having a really hard time trying to get this really giant piece of antique furniture Into the rental house that we're only gonna be in for like a month and I just remember standing there watching them Just like this very crystal-clear kid memory.

798
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:04,419
Rym: But anyway, that's no that's really relevant And you're the stressed-out person who's got a move.

799
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,065
Rym: yeah, that's what we're all gonna be.

800
00:52:06,145 --> 00:52:10,369
Scott: so option one Spend a fuck ton of money.

801
00:52:10,911 --> 00:52:18,140
Rym: I'm gonna say this somebody take care of every goddamn thing if you can afford that Even if it's a stretch.

802
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,589
Scott: afford that your life is already easy.

803
00:52:19,796 --> 00:52:23,100
Rym: Yeah But like that is expensive even for us.

804
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,970
Scott: there are people who you can pay who will come.

805
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:28,741
Scott: Pack up all your things you have to do.

806
00:52:28,862 --> 00:52:30,730
Scott: live lift no finger whatsoever.

807
00:52:31,051 --> 00:52:33,501
Scott: They'll pack up all your shit at your instruction.

808
00:52:34,104 --> 00:52:44,270
Scott: Take it to where you are moving to Unpack it and place it where it belongs in the new place according to your instruction Like to the level of they will put your clothes in the right closets, right?

809
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,029
Scott: You will leave the place.

810
00:52:46,332 --> 00:52:46,916
Scott: Look it look.

811
00:52:46,957 --> 00:52:52,990
Scott: you will just get up and walk out of your house Like you're going to the mall or whatever or going out to dinner like go on vacation for the weekend.

812
00:52:53,171 --> 00:53:04,530
Scott: You'll go on vacation or go to a hotel or go wherever you're gonna go and then they'll tell you they're done and you will Or they'll schedule and you'll know when they'll be done and you arrive and at the new place every.

813
00:53:05,193 --> 00:53:13,035
Scott: Your silverware is already in the drawer your clothes are in the closet Your TV is plugged in into the entertainment center Which is fully set up and ready to use.

814
00:53:13,677 --> 00:53:15,622
Scott: if you can't afford this do it.

815
00:53:16,023 --> 00:53:16,384
Scott: Also.

816
00:53:16,665 --> 00:53:17,106
Rym: Fuck you.

817
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:21,469
Rym: Yeah Dynamite a rich person I would say it.

818
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:27,650
Rym: I don't actually know how much that would cost But I would try would save up to try to do it depending on where I was moving.

819
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:30,730
Scott: It depends on how far you're moving and how much stuff you have, right?

820
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:46,071
Rym: Yeah But yeah That's that kind of service is actually pretty reasonable price if you were moving from Relatively small apartment to other relatively small apartment in the same city Yeah, but if you're moving like a house to a house that would cost like more than a car Right.

821
00:53:46,472 --> 00:53:47,878
Scott: So the net I mean, you know, you could.

822
00:53:47,918 --> 00:53:50,830
Scott: so basically that service that is the top tier moving service.

823
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:57,229
Scott: You can moving companies allow you to scale that service down to basically almost nothing.

824
00:53:57,289 --> 00:54:02,385
Scott: Yep And everywhere in between what I would recommend dream granularity, right?

825
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:04,935
Scott: It's like well, I want you to unpack my stuff But not pack it.

826
00:54:04,996 --> 00:54:06,870
Scott: I want you to pack some stuff, but not everything.

827
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,700
Scott: I want you to at every level.

828
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,697
Scott: if I want you to take it this far But don't take it all the way.

829
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:13,910
Scott: take move this stuff, but not that stuff.

830
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:22,032
Scott: You can literally with every measure of granularity the moving companies the good ones will service and price you Accordingly,

831
00:54:22,153 --> 00:54:31,746
Rym: yep, right the the sweet spot in terms of like even if your money sensitive Which you should be because then the the sweet spot is pretty much get a moving company.

832
00:54:31,766 --> 00:54:35,670
Rym: That is a real company That is that has insurance and is bonded.

833
00:54:36,044 --> 00:54:41,670
Scott: Yep A lot of buildings will check or you know to make sure not use non insured moving companies.

834
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:49,069
Scott: because like if you live in a certain kind of building as opposed right they then they'll want to make sure that the They'll want proof that they're insured.

835
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:50,120
Scott: Otherwise, they won't let him in.

836
00:54:50,141 --> 00:54:56,869
Scott: because yeah That's the thing that means that if those movers bust something up in the building like say the elevator Then who's gonna pay for that?

837
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:59,901
Scott: well when we move insurance would pay for that if they had insurance.

838
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:06,290
Rym: so the last time we moved before we came for like When we were moving to New York City out of our house and beacon use three Russian dudes in a truck.

839
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,542
Rym: No, we use three Georgian dudes in the trucks.

840
00:55:08,663 --> 00:55:14,868
Rym: Okay, right, but With they caused a surprising amount of damage to the house on the way out.

841
00:55:14,928 --> 00:55:15,370
Rym: That's right.

842
00:55:15,932 --> 00:55:19,285
Rym: In fact almost immediately they put a giant hole in the ceiling.

843
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:21,656
Rym: Yep, so We were just.

844
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:22,741
Rym: we were just on the hook for that.

845
00:55:23,043 --> 00:55:23,988
Rym: Yeah, that was just awesome.

846
00:55:24,129 --> 00:55:29,630
Rym: Yep So, uh, make sure they've got insurance and actually check to see that that's not just fake.

847
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:34,990
Rym: If there are a lot of moving companies that are scams the moving company is super pro like the one I just hired.

848
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:41,390
Scott: They're like, oh by the way, if any buildings ask for insurance mama, it's like they they're upfront about the insurance.

849
00:55:41,452 --> 00:55:43,035
Scott: Yep, right They took care of everything.

850
00:55:43,095 --> 00:55:45,506
Rym: find a real moving company and get a real quote from them.

851
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:48,370
Scott: and the sweet spot Yeah, real quotes from several real moving come.

852
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:50,630
Rym: Yes Because moving companies don't just post prices.

853
00:55:50,971 --> 00:55:54,890
Rym: Anyone who says a flat rate is probably a scam and it's probably gonna fuck you over.

854
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:59,690
Scott: No the way that the way the moving company they wanted to know they had to give them an estimate and then a quote.

855
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:00,854
Scott: Right and the estimate.

856
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:13,590
Scott: they wanted to know exactly what I was moving the exact amount of stuff like one bed 10 small boxes 20 medium boxes five large box Oh and along those lines one if you want to estimate couch to bookcase one TV.

857
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:18,170
Scott: It's like they want to know an exact list of what you're moving and then they give you a price based on that.

858
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:23,210
Rym: However, many boxes you think you need you probably need a literally a third more than that.

859
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,580
Scott: Well, the thing is my move actually would have been pretty easy.

860
00:56:25,801 --> 00:56:30,169
Scott: The only thing that ruined me was the Books, I have so many.

861
00:56:32,113 --> 00:56:34,304
Scott: And the thing with books is they're heavy as hell.

862
00:56:34,344 --> 00:56:35,510
Rym: So you have to use the small box.

863
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,535
Scott: You have to use small.

864
00:56:36,595 --> 00:56:39,670
Scott: right you think oh, I'll just get a few big boxes and put all my stuff in it.

865
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,539
Scott: Well, then you can't lift that box dumbass.

866
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,066
Scott: Yeah, right you have to get.

867
00:56:43,226 --> 00:56:51,522
Scott: for heavy things You need small boxes and lots of them and for light fluffy things You can get big boxes, right all the other very important books fit in 40 small boxes.

868
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:57,149
Scott: Well, it sounds about right and the price it cost to move the boxes.

869
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:01,661
Scott: now You got to do some calculations like well What if I just get rid of this shit and just buy it again?

870
00:57:01,681 --> 00:57:06,098
Scott: if I actually that's usually cheaper If I actually need it, I'll buy it again.

871
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:13,010
Scott: if I get rid of it and never need that want to read that book again Then it wasn't a loss that I got rid of it and I saved money by not moving.

872
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,863
Scott: Yeah, right you to make these kinds of calculation.

873
00:57:15,883 --> 00:57:17,370
Rym: There's a subtle point here about those boxes.

874
00:57:18,012 --> 00:57:19,377
Rym: Buy new boxes.

875
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:31,918
Rym: Hopefully they're made from recycled material, but buying new boxes Yeah buy new boxes that are all the same sizes and shapes like if you need three kinds of boxes by 50 of each kind of box.

876
00:57:31,999 --> 00:57:34,530
Scott: I bought all boxes that were made by the same company.

877
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:38,810
Rym: Yeah, and try to avoid you line because there's like conservative shit that goes on with that company.

878
00:57:40,035 --> 00:57:40,336
Scott: The other.

879
00:57:40,537 --> 00:57:41,821
Scott: I bought bankers box.

880
00:57:41,882 --> 00:57:43,106
Scott: I don't know if they're better or worse.

881
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,110
Scott: I'm not endorsing whatever.

882
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,274
Scott: The reason I chose them was good.

883
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:45,836
Scott: They had lids.

884
00:57:46,218 --> 00:57:50,957
Rym: Yeah, you line is like super partisan and bad like do not Don't do any business any.

885
00:57:50,977 --> 00:57:53,750
Rym: you line anything even though they have them like a stranglehold on this stuff.

886
00:57:53,970 --> 00:58:02,118
Scott: But anyway, the point is the boxes I got had lids which makes it great for moving because you don't have to like seal the Box of tape and then well that's sealed.

887
00:58:02,379 --> 00:58:11,090
Scott: you can keep rearranging and cramming more stuff in the boxes You know to hopefully reduce your costs and opening and closing them and rearranging Tetris thing, right?

888
00:58:11,391 --> 00:58:14,864
Scott: Yep, but yeah, so it took me in order to save money.

889
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:15,867
Scott: I packed my own shit.

890
00:58:16,088 --> 00:58:17,114
Rym: Yep, sweet spot Here's the deal.

891
00:58:17,154 --> 00:58:21,775
Rym: pack your own shit except for All your furniture.

892
00:58:21,996 --> 00:58:23,462
Rym: have the movers pack that.

893
00:58:23,602 --> 00:58:25,430
Rym: take it apart all that nonsense, right?

894
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:32,087
Rym: Cuz they're gonna have a bunch of stuff You don't own that you don't want to buy and rent Like all the moving pads and the bubble wrap and all the stuff to like.

895
00:58:32,107 --> 00:58:35,242
Rym: make that happen Unless you are a professional and you know what you're doing.

896
00:58:35,463 --> 00:58:37,010
Rym: You're gonna fuck that up, right?

897
00:58:37,251 --> 00:58:40,263
Rym: You think you've wrapped it securely that you're gonna break shit.

898
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,070
Rym: you're gonna break way more things than you realize.

899
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,590
Scott: It's also gonna take all fucking day, right?

900
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:46,910
Scott: It's like how long did it take us to get right in the old the last moving episode?

901
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,719
Scott: We talked about getting that fucking couch.

902
00:58:49,161 --> 00:58:50,730
Rym: Oh my god into the apartment.

903
00:58:51,072 --> 00:58:55,190
Rym: Oh, it took us over an hour to get one a one thing into our apartment.

904
00:58:55,412 --> 00:59:05,282
Scott: But meanwhile when we got when we moved out a beacon Right that the junk collecting donating people picked it up and walked out in like a minute even those Georgian dudes Even though they were not bonded and not insured.

905
00:59:05,604 --> 00:59:06,430
Rym: They knew their shit.

906
00:59:06,814 --> 00:59:16,955
Rym: So they emptied over all the furniture Every piece of furniture that was still in that house in less time than it took us to get that fucking couch right from the truck To the porch.

907
00:59:17,076 --> 00:59:22,243
Scott: It took me weeks to put all my shit into boxes And even then a lot of shit didn't actually make it into a box.

908
00:59:22,283 --> 00:59:23,730
Scott: It was kind of a little bit haphazard.

909
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:26,162
Scott: Yeah, a lot of leftovers and knickknacks here and there.

910
00:59:26,524 --> 00:59:27,589
Scott: those movers came in.

911
00:59:28,192 --> 00:59:35,770
Scott: It took them an hour to empty the apartment like BAM Like in all the furniture all the boxes all the stuff that was poorly packed.

912
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:41,707
Scott: Yeah, I'll bet everything and that included, you know, Oh getting new boxes and packing more shit.

913
00:59:42,088 --> 00:59:42,630
Rym: pay for that.

914
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:45,482
Rym: Do not just try to put it all in the truck yourself.

915
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:54,450
Scott: unless you try to have a minimalist life That's a lot of money But that's partially because they made two stops before then arriving at the destination right to pick up someone else's stuff, right?

916
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:58,550
Scott: But yeah, it was like the it's like if I hadn't had paid that money.

917
00:59:58,691 --> 01:00:03,817
Scott: I would have been so burned if I had to do that some other way Especially because there's a big.

918
01:00:03,857 --> 01:00:06,370
Rym: there's one thing that goes on here with houses and moving.

919
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:09,883
Scott: I would have basically my alternative y'all like would have done is either a completely fuck up.

920
01:00:10,605 --> 01:00:13,988
Scott: Yep, or be suffer a great deal.

921
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:15,252
Rym: Moving.

922
01:00:15,473 --> 01:00:18,410
Scott: see all of the above moving to get rid of all my shit.

923
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:18,811
Scott: I don't know.

924
01:00:19,112 --> 01:00:23,890
Rym: moving from a house to a house is easier in one sense in that you have a whole house to like stage.

925
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:26,540
Rym: Yeah, I do the overlap period like.

926
01:00:27,022 --> 01:00:39,929
Rym: I'm not gonna explain to you how mortgages work But usually you'll have like a 30 60 or 90 day residency and all this stuff meaning You will still have your house and have like between one and three months of having the new house.

927
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:47,518
Rym: So you have time to move stuff with apartments and leases and like the way we all at least Ended on a day and the new lease.

928
01:00:47,819 --> 01:00:53,508
Rym: I had a 15-day overlap and even though we got money We can't afford to pay to New York rent suck.

929
01:00:53,569 --> 01:00:57,430
Rym: now For longer than like a day or two my money went so way down.

930
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:09,330
Scott: I lost right between moving paying more rents paying security deposits trying to get security buzzes back Paying all these other services besides movies buying new furnitures.

931
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:14,290
Scott: If you move into your lost a large portion of my money's moving in New York.

932
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:17,924
Rym: Like if you have a week overlap, like that's as good as you're gonna get.

933
01:01:17,964 --> 01:01:19,410
Rym: that means you like time this perfectly.

934
01:01:19,571 --> 01:01:21,921
Scott: Yeah, I had 15 days and I made it.

935
01:01:21,942 --> 01:01:27,990
Scott: and then even after I've got all this stuff out I had to like keep going back to the old apartment to hire like a cleaning service

936
01:01:28,411 --> 01:01:28,873
Rym: Oh and

937
01:01:28,913 --> 01:01:35,651
Scott: like junk collecting to clean out old stuff and the old place to make it, you know, perfectly empty Again,

938
01:01:36,033 --> 01:01:36,375
Rym: yep,

939
01:01:36,737 --> 01:01:37,240
Scott: and but yeah.

940
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,930
Scott: then when they be the moving company They did great at doing the final bits of packing not all the packing.

941
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:48,849
Scott: I did most of y'all right getting everything out in a truck bringing it to the new place Putting it all in the new place.

942
01:01:49,398 --> 01:01:56,635
Scott: They put you know The large pieces of furniture where they were directed to but mostly the boxes were just like alright, here's your boxes Unpackings on you.

943
01:01:56,876 --> 01:01:59,109
Scott: Yep, and I'm still not completely unpacked.

944
01:01:59,129 --> 01:02:00,724
Rym: Yeah Oh, it took us a month to unpack.

945
01:02:00,744 --> 01:02:03,923
Scott: when we moved into this We finally have all the furniture and other think.

946
01:02:03,963 --> 01:02:05,270
Scott: the hanging guy came today.

947
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:08,463
Scott: He hung the shelves and he hung the TV on the wall.

948
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:17,849
Rym: now in houses when people in the houses I've often heard this strategy that I think is brilliant and we even did it when we were when we moved as kids You only unpack boxes as you need the things in

949
01:02:17,889 --> 01:02:21,304
Scott: them Yep, and if a box never gets unpacked, it means nothing.

950
01:02:21,324 --> 01:02:22,087
Scott: You don't need anything in there.

951
01:02:22,107 --> 01:02:24,448
Scott: Just throw it out Yep, or donate it or whatever Yep.

952
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,575
Rym: So you put all the box.

953
01:02:25,716 --> 01:02:28,910
Rym: after you do the initial unpacking all the boxes that still have stuff in him.

954
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:30,215
Rym: You just put them in the basement and wait.

955
01:02:30,516 --> 01:02:31,159
Rym: see what happens.

956
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,890
Rym: but in an apartment there's nowhere to put those boxes.

957
01:02:34,031 --> 01:02:46,190
Scott: No my basically All my stuff that in an apartment was efficiently stored in closets in various places Right to save space and clear out room had to get brought out into the open and put in a box.

958
01:02:46,752 --> 01:02:50,070
Scott: There was no room to move around my apartment as I was moving out of it.

959
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:55,210
Rym: Well, I should post a picture I have when we moved into this apartment because the boxes were taking up all the room.

960
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:56,936
Scott: I couldn't even get to my desk or anything.

961
01:02:57,036 --> 01:03:01,170
Rym: Our living room is just completely full of boxes and disassembled furniture.

962
01:03:01,491 --> 01:03:03,840
Rym: Yeah, like it's a nightmare picture and I remember.

963
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:04,885
Rym: I remember this moment.

964
01:03:04,905 --> 01:03:06,270
Rym: I was standing in the living room.

965
01:03:06,571 --> 01:03:08,518
Rym: It was dark because we didn't have the lights unpacked yet.

966
01:03:08,779 --> 01:03:09,562
Rym: I was by myself.

967
01:03:09,843 --> 01:03:13,453
Rym: I was looking at this giant pile of shit Despairing at the world.

968
01:03:13,573 --> 01:03:25,354
Rym: Yep, and I just closed my eyes and I imagined to myself there will be a day Maybe not now maybe not next week But there will be a day where all of this has Transformed into.

969
01:03:25,675 --> 01:03:29,511
Rym: there is a couch and a TV and I'm gonna sit on that couch and turn on that TV and play a video Game.

970

Rym: Yep, and a month later.

971
01:03:31,037 --> 01:03:32,102

Scott: I'm gonna be at that day like within a week Yeah, and then you will start resuming your life.

01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,063
Scott: I got to take care of.

977
