1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,359
Rym: It's Tuesday October 8th 2019.

2
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:13,269
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:21,278
Rym: tonight We are talking about a train game in space 2038 tycoons of the asteroid belt.

4
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:25,210
Rym: Can you build a financial empire in space?

5
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,796
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:36,460
Rym: So yesterday I stayed at work a little late because I kind of there's a whole thing going on like a big important project.

7
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:39,520
Rym: And you know, I'm a product manager and I do a lot of things.

8
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:44,860
Rym: It's hard to say what a product manager means because it literally has a different definition every company.

9
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:50,780
Rym: But basically I was asked to make some slides to be able to present something to important people today.

10
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:59,489
Rym: So yesterday I stayed like an hour late and I made these slides because people have realized that making slides is something I am like fucking pro at like.

11
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,260
Rym: I think the two of us could just have a job making slides me and Scott.

12
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:10,839
Scott: If anyone wants to hire me as a professional slide maker that job would be way easier than the job I have now and if you pay me more or as much I mean.

13
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:19,260
Rym: So I stay late and I make these slides because today at like 10 a.m I got to do a really important presentation on these slides.

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,919
Rym: So first I gotta figure out what the hell these slides are about.

15
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:22,648
Rym: I gotta I gotta let do my things.

16
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:23,493
Rym: I get my thing ready.

17
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:24,940
Rym: I get up early today.

18
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,046
Rym: I head over to the subway like 8.

19
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:31,343
Scott: Oh, you have to get up early to get to work it by 10.

20
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:34,075
Rym: No, I wanted to get to work a little early to like look at these with.

21
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:34,517
Rym: some of the other.

22
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:38,080
Rym: people are gonna be in The room and like a sanity check and I had to go to a different office.

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,665
Rym: so I wanted but I wanted time.

24
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:40,809
Rym: so I got up a little early.

25
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:57,957
Rym: like have a leisurely morning before I do a big thing and I get on the train at like 815 810 and suddenly the train like runs over something and Stops dead and just sits there not moving in the tunnel with no signal.

26
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,363
Rym: Mmm I was trapped on that train for two full hours Mm-hmm.

27
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:18,619
Rym: the worst part about this for me at that point was simply that a lot of people including my boss were like expecting me to show up at this meeting at 10 and 10 o'clock was actually rapidly approaching and I had no way to tell anyone what happened to

28
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:18,740
Scott: me.

29
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:21,000
Scott: Nope So not when you're under the river.

30
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:30,080
Rym: So as far as literally like all these people are converging on this room Like for this important meeting and bit by bit I imagine it's starting to be like where's Rym.

31
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:32,886
Rym: Hey, he hasn't even like shown up at work yet.

32
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:34,631
Rym: It's 945.

33
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:35,253
Rym: Where is he?

34
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:36,336
Rym: Did you try calling him?

35
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,359
Rym: Yeah, I tried calling him.

36
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:39,806
Rym: Can't get through what's going on.

37
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:40,107
Rym: Oh, no.

38
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:40,910
Rym: Has anyone seen him?

39
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:43,179
Rym: Like that is clearly going on.

40
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:57,010
Rym: so eventually after like 40 minutes they get on and they're like, yeah the emergency brake something something something To trail off crack a shit.

41
00:02:57,393 --> 00:03:04,640
Rym: Yeah, so eventually Someone walks through the train very slowly and people are of course asking them question.

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:13,913
Rym: Well walks through the train is not quite what happened shoves their way through the train because I was stuck for two hours Standing up crushed against the wall on a completely packed subway train.

43
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,020
Scott: Oh, it was a full train completely full.

44
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,908
Rym: so I'm like crushed against the wall like Rereading the same way.

45
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:22,159
Rym: post story again because I ran out of shit to do on my phone.

46
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:23,947
Scott: Play reason the galaxy hundred.

47
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:26,880
Rym: I finished that book I was reading and I hadn't downloaded a new.

48
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:32,912
Scott: Well, you could never run out of pages into a reading Tale of Genji is not actually on my phone.

49
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:34,760
Rym: I've been reading that on my kindle stakes are made.

50
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:38,459
Scott: Yep, I would have been okay with a Kindle app on your phone and sync it.

51
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:39,744
Rym: Yeah, I should.

52
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,350
Rym: but anyway, I'm gonna do.

53
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,771
Rym: I'm gonna.

54
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:44,079
Rym: tale of Genji is gonna get on my phone tonight.

55
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:57,499
Rym: I know that the next time I'm delayed for two hours with no internet I will have a literally Unlimited amount of entertainment because if I get all the way to the end of the tale of Genji It'll have been so long that I could go back to the beginning having forgotten the details of what happened, correct?

56
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:07,946
Rym: As happens when I watch certain anime over again, so, uh eventually the train Is not gonna move.

57
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,478
Rym: so they announced that rescue trains are coming.

58
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:12,751
Scott: All right Well, it's a very so people don't know.

59
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:17,309
Rym: the seven trace the seven train Train is like the second most important subway in New York.

60
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,940
Scott: There are several trains that go underneath the East River.

61
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,250
Scott: They're also trains that go over the East River on bridges Like the J train just goes on a bridge right.

62
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,002
Rym: all of them goes so deep that it has to go Under.

63
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:30,191
Rym: Roosevelt Island is the deepest subway station.

64
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:32,239
Scott: Yeah, the F train goes under Roosevelt Island.

65
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:34,484
Scott: The N and R trains.

66
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,226
Scott: they have a tunnel.

67
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:38,655
Scott: right now the EC the E train has a tunnel.

68
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:43,760
Scott: Yeah, but then the Seven the seven train has its own tunnel.

69
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,195
Rym: Well, the seven train has something known as what the Steinway tube the Steinway tube.

70
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:49,500
Rym: It has fucking iron.

71
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:54,717
Rym: It's over a hundred years is a cast iron literal tube.

72
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:57,465
Scott: Also, those are IRT trains.

73
00:04:57,606 --> 00:05:02,137
Scott: So it's they're narrower right track wise and narrower trains.

74
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:06,092
Scott: then I get the trot track wise but the trains are narrower.

75
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:12,507
Rym: Yeah, right then the BMT and IND trains Because we're gonna talk about a train game.

76
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:13,651
Scott: No, this is relevant.

77
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,940
Scott: and those tubes are super narrow.

78
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:24,440
Scott: They're so narrow that they do not have room to be for a worker to be in the tube working While the train is in the tube.

79
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,351
Scott: It's not like normal tunnels where I give someone a nook to hide in.

80
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:32,480
Scott: it's like no what they want to work on the tunnel Which they have to do a lot because they're old and busted.

81
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:37,500
Rym: New tunnels need to be dug, but we can't afford that because of upstate New York, right?

82
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,578
Scott: But anyway, so they have to basically stop seven service between Manhattan and Queens or to work on the tunnel.

83
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:48,320
Scott: and also The tunnels are just cast-iron tubes that are constantly leaking water into them.

84
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:49,370
Rym: So there's pumps in there.

85
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:54,540
Scott: right like think about it Even if there's not a hole in it, which there probably are holes and cracks in it for who right somewhere.

86
00:05:54,981 --> 00:06:00,679
Scott: But you know if you take your cast-iron pot, it's sort of like it can get wet.

87
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,840
Scott: It's like it's not a hundred percent non-porous, right?

88
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:07,774
Scott: Water is getting in there all the time.

89
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:12,553
Scott: It's underneath a river and They have to pump that water the fuck out.

90
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,020
Scott: There are pumps running all the time.

91
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,640
Scott: If the pumps of enough pumps fail, yeah, then it will flood and you can't go in there.

92
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:26,909
Rym: The important thing is the NW train and the seven train between the two of them That is millions and millions and millions of people.

93
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,740
Rym: like that is a hugely important subway System those two train two sets of trains.

94
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:41,014
Rym: So the city has a protocol where if one of them is down The other one cannot under any circumstances be down or it is a like.

95
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:43,140
Rym: it is a ridiculous disaster for the city.

96
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,370
Scott: Yeah, man, everyone on each.

97
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:48,269
Scott: Yeah 100% capacity.

98
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,838
Scott: you have everyone on EF train.

99
00:06:49,959 --> 00:07:00,120
Rym: Yep So the seven being down for like three and a half Like that train being down probably caused tens of millions of dollars in economic damage to New York City.

100
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:02,368
Rym: Yep, like it was a shit was a big disaster.

101
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:05,780
Rym: So eventually a rescue train comes in from the front.

102
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:07,451
Scott: Yeah, they can't come in from the side.

103
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:07,813
Scott: Yep.

104
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:16,360
Rym: It's well, it's a Because there are two tracks in this tiny - yeah, and we were kind of near Grand Central like we were approaching Grand Central.

105
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:27,100
Rym: So they brought a train from the front and they just rolled it up and eventually like they opened doors They made a platform between the two and put up all these tarps and then they made everyone walk from the train.

106
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,740
Rym: We were on forward to this new train and once they got everyone that train they're gonna take us in the Grand Central.

107
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:36,867
Rym: I don't know if you understand how long New York City subway trains are.

108
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:40,500
Rym: it took like a half hour to get everyone to walk into this other train.

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,405
Scott: Well, you only need half the people to walk into the because you can bring another Half.

110
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:47,269
Scott: had another half right but you know But you I imagine you were in.

111
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,646
Scott: if you're in the front even in the front car You're in the front car.

112
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:55,900
Scott: You still have to walk the entire length Of the new rescue train to get to its front front car.

113
00:07:56,101 --> 00:08:00,220
Scott: Yeah, well was rear is now gonna be front car when it moves the other direction.

114
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:18,922
Rym: Yeah anyway so we walk up eventually and then this this rescue train is gonna go and it starts to move a little bit and then It fucks up and the emergency brake kicks in and it gets stuck like five feet away people.

115
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,318
Rym: I Said my favorite phrase in the world Thank You New York, okay.

116
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:27,049
Rym: So eventually the train like we get into the station.

117
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:28,994
Rym: It's like 101.

118
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:35,913
Rym: So of course my phone goes apeshit now And I call my bosses and everything and they're like, yeah the meetings about to start.

119
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:48,340
Rym: so I run to my office which is not where the meeting is log into the video conference out of breath and I do the presentation remotely while someone else presents the slides in the room and that was super difficult and stressful.

120
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:51,640
Rym: I couldn't even hear what any was saying in the room because the microphone in the room was bad.

121
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:58,949
Rym: So people were asking me questions and I was guessing what they had asked and I guess I answered every question correctly Despite not actually hearing any words.

122
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,314
Rym: They said except a few nouns.

123
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:00,656
Rym: Mm-hmm.

124
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:01,600
Rym: Everything went fine.

125
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:06,596
Rym: I didn't actually learn until later when I was talking to Scott randomly that what had happened was the train.

126
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:11,631
Rym: the car I was in Ran somebody over and that thing I felt was the crushing.

127
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:13,537
Rym: Yep, and those tarps were said.

128
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:14,299
Rym: no one saw it.

129
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:16,199
Scott: There were tarps under the train.

130
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:22,002
Rym: well They put tarps up as we had to walk from one train to the other train and they put like tarps up that They were.

131
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:30,841
Rym: all the workers were implying it was to make it sure we couldn't like fall out the side when we because we had To jump across the bike from one train to the other there was like a two-foot gap We don't?

132
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:34,096
Scott: they usually just take a metal sheet and use it as a bridge.

133
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:34,759
Rym: They didn't have that.

134
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,267
Rym: yet They waited until every.

135
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:38,681
Scott: those aren't those like included in every train car Like.

136
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:43,520
Rym: there's just like a secret compartment a metro north and those are for side to side.

137
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:45,187
Scott: Train rescue could still use it.

138
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:46,493
Rym: Yeah, they did.

139
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:47,316
Rym: we had to jump across.

140
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,120
Rym: It's like two-foot gap.

141
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,283
Scott: What if someone couldn't jump?

142
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:50,688
Rym: everyone who couldn't jump?

143
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:54,098
Rym: they waited until everyone walked across which was the vast majority of people.

144
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:54,560
Rym: and then?

145
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:04,249
Rym: MJP workers like went and Yeah, they individually helped everyone else one by one, okay So that was my Odyssey this morning.

146
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:05,153
Rym: All right.

147
00:10:05,173 --> 00:10:09,127
Scott: Well, my opening bit is way less exciting And let way less unusual.

148
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,837
Scott: So I've been trying to buy some jean.

149
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:19,190
Rym: Oh So Uniqlo they don't they don't have the good Uniqlo jeans anymore, but it's like, okay Well, but that's the thing is the Uniqlo jeans.

150
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,620
Scott: I got the last time I got Uniqlo jeans, right?

151
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:29,880
Scott: They were you know, right size right comfiness level, but they were lacking in the durability and lasting department.

152
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:32,688
Scott: They literally broke.

153
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:35,014
Scott: You know, I was like the old Uniqlo jeans.

154
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,839
Rym: I still have one pair of those left.

155
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,728
Scott: I was like Even cheapo Levi's, they're not the comfiest.

156
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:43,036
Scott: They're not the best fitting but they don't break.

157
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:47,200
Scott: They're super strong Yeah, so I switched by rectification.

158
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,580
Rym: I gave up all my jeans are just basically spandex and I just replaced them every few years because they wear out.

159
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,256
Scott: Well, I was recommended to go get American Eagle jeans.

160
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:58,380
Rym: So I did right But they're really durable.

161
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:05,760
Scott: well so what happened was is I got them and they were way comfy and They're the right size and they're stretchy and they look good.

162
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:10,850
Scott: But what happened is Some of the ones I got right.

163
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:15,755
Scott: they were like 32 30 The inseam was 32, which was correct.

164
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:16,560
Scott: when they were new.

165
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:22,419
Scott: I go with the 34 because and they they shrunk a little bit and then they became a little high watery.

166
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:24,810
Rym: Oh, the high water is the worst, right?

167
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,816
Scott: So then I tried some 34 But that was too long.

168
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:37,123
Rym: So my Strategy I wear 30 34 so 30 inch waist even though it's a little big but it's hard to get 29 34.

169
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:39,031
Rym: So I get 30 24 or 30 34 and I just roll up the cuffs.

170
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:42,406
Rym: I do the style of.

171
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:43,833
Rym: I've rolled up cuffs in all my jeans, right?

172
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:54,060
Scott: So anyway, so then There's a company called Madewell, which is owned by J crew and in the city all their stores only sell ladies clothes and they specialize in denim.

173
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,084
Scott: They like denim bar.

174
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:57,997
Rym: So I'll admit straight up some of the G. a lot of my jeans are women's jeans.

175
00:11:58,037 --> 00:11:58,720
Rym: guys fit me better.

176
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:04,511
Scott: So on their website, however The Madewell website they have man jeans.

177
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,217
Rym: Oh, but not in the store.

178
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:07,140
Scott: So yeah, right.

179
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:10,860
Scott: So I ordered their man jeans on their website, which were expensive.

180
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:16,099
Scott: But Amanda got something was like, oh these are worth all the money's they're so great I'm intrigued now.

181
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,800
Scott: So I ordered them from the website and I right but but the ones I ordered they were way too big.

182
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:25,659
Rym: Oh, so I went like are the numbers just wrong?

183
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:36,136
Scott: They were like they were super long and super fat in the butt and like the butt was like I had like a little Parachute, but yeah, that's partly why increasingly I just wear spandex.

184
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:37,240
Rym: that looks like jeans.

185
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:42,020
Scott: Oh, so then I apparently the thing was is you can return those at their store.

186
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:43,780
Scott: So I went to their store and it took two minutes.

187
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,920
Scott: I gave them the jeans that came in the mail and they gave me my money back.

188
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:51,636
Scott: So then I'm like, you know what I heard about this store, right?

189
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:52,600
Scott: I work in like Soho.

190
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,287
Scott: It's like the fancy fashion II district.

191
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:57,500
Scott: we're like ultra high-end shit where you know, rich people buy stuff.

192
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:00,753
Scott: I'm like, let's just go they're not gonna kick me out.

193
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,099
Scott: I'll just go to the rich people store.

194
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:07,499
Scott: Try on some rich people jeans and not buy them and see if it's or is it worth it to buy?

195
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:09,062
Scott: $250 jeans.

196
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:11,493
Rym: So the last time I did that was gloves.

197
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:16,272
Rym: I went to the fancy fancy place in Midtown There's like ten years ago and I was like, what are fancy gloves like?

198
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:18,460
Rym: and I tried on some leather gloves.

199
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,725
Rym: They were like they were like butter.

200
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:21,733
Rym: and then I thought these are what like $400.

201
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:21,954
Rym: All right.

202
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:25,513
Rym: No, they were $4,000 and I walked out of that store.

203
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:31,314
Scott: So I went to this store at the rag and bone where the jeans are $250 each.

204
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:33,440
Scott: right expecting not to buy any jeans.

205
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:34,960
Scott: Oh, I didn't buy any jeans?

206
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,564
Rym: Yeah, not paying $250 for one gene.

207
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:43,212
Rym: fuck that I would if they were durable and perfect if I can wear them for a decade.

208
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:44,295
Rym: the play was comfortable.

209
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:51,960
Scott: place was very much Shiloh warm sirs crack pipe dude wanted to like bring me water while I was in the dressing room.

210
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:56,929
Scott: Right, it was often glove place.

211
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,377
Rym: they followed me around like they thought it was a shoplifter because I didn't look fancy enough, right?

212
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:04,367
Scott: So The thing was is for $250.

213
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:10,346
Scott: It's like all right, maybe what you know, if this gene will last me 15 years, I mean I

214
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:14,420
Rym: bought a thousand dollar computer chair a long time ago, and I'm still using the right

215
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:23,726
Scott: Right, so and like if this gene well is the most perfect fitting gene in the universe, right and will last me a super long Time and that's fucking great.

216
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:26,216
Scott: Then I might consider buying it.

217
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:33,620
Scott: It was on sale Yeah, and so I go to try on a whole bunch, right and in I got there.

218
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,305
Scott: They don't give you lengths on these.

219
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:41,585
Scott: they're only with what there's only with and they're all about 34s at least what they say.

220
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:45,455
Scott: and then if you need shorter then you can tailor them.

221
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:54,120
Scott: you can you go get them shortened And the guy actually suggested we will shorten them for you for $30, but he's like you should just go somewhere else.

222
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,369
Scott: It will be cheaper and faster.

223
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:56,800
Scott: All right good on him, right?

224
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:02,140
Scott: Cuz he says that yeah, it takes us like three weeks to do it and we charge 30 bucks each.

225
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:08,220
Scott: But basically they just make all their genes Slightly longer than at any average person would need them and then expect you to shorten them.

226
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Rym: See I choose to do the new style of always get 34s and just roll them up, right?

227
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:20,460
Scott: But yeah, so the I got there was and also their genes run big which I'm like if they're expensive fancy rich people ones.

228
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,764
Scott: Shouldn't they just be exactly right?

229
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:22,627
Scott: Why are they right?

230
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,454
Rym: But I took for that.

231
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:25,678
Rym: you need tailored genes.

232
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:27,424
Rym: where they cut They make them for you.

233
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:27,825
Scott: Yeah.

234
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:36,490
Scott: Anyway, I got 32s in two different colors, but basically the same exact gene and one of them was a lot like Different size than the other.

235
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:43,840
Scott: what it was like I'm like feels like they were not I was expecting like perfect amazing comfort and whatnot.

236
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:49,740
Rym: No, cuz like when I got I got a few tailored shirts for like fancy occasions and they were expensive but not crazy expensive.

237
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:55,611
Rym: They were expensive but they fit Perfectly, I mean these were like so perfectly.

238
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:56,354
Rym: It's weird.

239
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:57,720
Rym: I'm like Finn's grass sword.

240
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:05,689
Scott: We were they were nice jeans and if I would have gotten them tailored to the right length, they would have fit all Perfectly as a gene is gonna fit.

241
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,854
Rym: but for you could.

242
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:11,394
Scott: but they were not Three times as good as a $90 or you know, whatever.

243
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,826
Scott: They were not like with steaks.

244
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:15,970
Rym: a $10 steak ain't that great.

245
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,552
Rym: a $20 takes pretty good.

246
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:17,094
Rym: a $40 steak is great.

247
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:22,117
Rym: A $400 steak is only slightly better than a $40 day, right?

248
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,552
Scott: The $250 gene was not three times better than the $75.

249
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:31,753
Scott: You find me a steak Better 85, I don't know.

250
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:38,040
Rym: find me a steak That is ten times better than a $40 steak and I will pay any amount of money for that steak.

251
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:39,424
Rym: Yeah, cuz it doesn't exist.

252
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:42,956
Scott: So I do not recommend the $250 gene.

253
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:58,527
Scott: What I did is I went back to the the Madewell one, right the ladies gene place Yeah, and I just went back to the website after getting my refund And it has ordered a smaller size because I can just return those again, too If they're not any good right

254
00:16:58,567 --> 00:16:59,473
Rym: also for that price.

255
00:16:59,513 --> 00:17:00,540
Scott: that doesn't work out.

256
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,864
Scott: I'll try some other place.

257
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:09,359
Rym: how much do actually just straight-up tailored jeans cost then compared to these like Multi-hundred-dollar not tailored jeans.

258
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:13,733
Scott: I mean I could have just bought those $250 jeans and had them shorten them and that would know.

259
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:20,657
Scott: tailored means they like measure Multiple parts of your body and every other part of the gene was pretty much exactly right as long, you know.

260
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,673
Scott: But not were it wasn't as good as the price.

261
00:17:24,914 --> 00:17:26,520
Rym: I got the problem because I run so much.

262
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,432
Rym: I got really big gams and very few jeans.

263
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:31,220
Rym: So tiny waist and big game.

264
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:45,994
Scott: well, so what you got to do if you got that is they have athletic cut jeans, which basically are this like extreme tapering situation Which is good if you're like a hockey player and you have a giant ass and giant thighs and like, you know Normal-sized normal-sized calf.

265
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:50,549
Scott: Yeah It's actually a relatively recent development.

266
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,938
Scott: it used to just be like skinny slim straight.

267
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,359
Scott: now There's like the athletic cut is a relatively recent thing.

268
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:59,820
Scott: Yeah, that is for people with gigantic thighs and asses.

269
00:18:00,422 --> 00:18:03,516
Rym: The other problem I have though is for any of you have met me in person.

270
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:07,887
Rym: I have Freakishly tiny wrists and ankles.

271
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:11,378
Scott: I have tiny wrists and also long arms.

272
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:15,919
Scott: Yeah while I was in there was like coats in the store and I was checking him out and the.

273
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:23,120
Scott: I saw a really nice coat at another store recently and when I looked inside the coat, it was four thousand or two thousand dollars.

274
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:26,495
Scott: And I looked at a coat in this store and I was like, oh that looks like that $2,000 coat.

275
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:30,208
Scott: and I was like Oh, it's only one thousand dollars.

276
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,034
Scott: I guess I still won't buy this.

277
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:33,960
Rym: I saved a thousand dollars, right?

278
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,079
Scott: but I tried it on and Basically the medium my arms came way out the sleeve and the large was like, you know a balloon.

279
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:43,640
Rym: see that's.

280
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,633
Rym: That's what I don't get when if you're paying that much money for something Better be tailored like.

281
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:50,520
Rym: if it's off the rack.

282
00:18:50,621 --> 00:18:53,500
Scott: It should be cheap anyway, and then I was in another store.

283
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,620
Scott: I was just passing by and they had a similar coat and it was like, oh only five hundred dollars.

284
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:00,452
Scott: Not buying this money.

285
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:08,570
Rym: I Remember when I was a kid, I got a $90 jacket once And I wore that jacket until it was just threads.

286
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:11,280
Rym: I bought I got a leather integrated around me.

287
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,456
Scott: I got a leather jacket suede leather.

288
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:13,900
Rym: I love that.

289
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,640
Scott: I got a leather jacket in high school from like this leather good store in the mall.

290
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:25,024
Scott: That was way good at least at the time and then the zipper got busted and then I had someone fix the zipper But it was still busted.

291
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:28,860
Scott: and then I just never went and got the zipper fixed again.

292
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:33,529
Scott: And then by the time I was like, oh, you know I should go and get the zipper fixed on that fucking thing.

293
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:40,963
Scott: and I went and I put it on and I was like Wow, this jacket from the 90s looks way derpy Fixed.

294
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:43,215
Scott: it's sort of big and poofy and derpy looking.

295
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:46,648
Scott: Wow Why did I think this is cool when it was new?

296
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:53,589
Scott: and then I gave donated it at the coat drive at the holiday season After like 15 to 20 years after I got it.

297
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:56,360
Rym: So there's a lot of really big news.

298
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:07,032
Rym: we're really only going to talk about one thing before we get into our space train game review, but briefly if you didn't notice the Professional hockey season has started while the NHL season.

299
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,100
Scott: There's a lot of other professional hockey in the world.

300
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:12,013
Rym: Yeah But this is the only hockey we're at.

301
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:21,894
Rym: at the conclusion of the season Some team will have the right to hold Lord Stanley's Cup mmm, and There's no like lockout like all that's like.

302
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:22,680
Rym: didn't none of that happen?

303
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,200
Rym: We're getting just normal hockey and I continue to be a fan of the undefeated New York Rangers.

304
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:30,775
Scott: Oh what happened to your and your your Detroit team?

305
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:31,800
Rym: I've lived in New York.

306
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,546
Scott: You disloyal person.

307
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,760
Scott: I think if I think if I move to Detroit, I would be like go wings.

308
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:41,717
Rym: You know if I live I moved to Detroit for 10 years.

309
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:45,635
Scott: I would probably really if I move to Detroit and live there the rest of my life.

310
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:48,806
Scott: Do you think I would ever Want the Red Wings to win?

311
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:52,200
Rym: but Scott, what about the people who are born in Buffalo?

312
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,319
Rym: You got to give him an escape.

313
00:20:54,561 --> 00:21:05,693
Scott: you mean my co-worker who is from Rochester and Was like Scott taking me to go see the Sabres and I was like, okay I can see the Red Wings play in New York like at best twice a year.

314
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:10,154
Scott: or I can mean once Oh, I guess you could see them against the Islanders.

315
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:14,633
Rym: Yeah That's the level of desperation it would take.

316
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:15,740
Scott: you can see them playing as the Devils.

317
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:20,280
Rym: Yeah I'd rather go see them play against the Islanders.

318
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:24,115
Rym: But or I can see the Rangers play all the time with a half season.

319
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:26,423
Rym: So mmm I live in New York.

320
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:29,533
Rym: But anyway the big news and it's all still developing.

321
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:42,960
Rym: So I want to send some context for this because China has gone after Both Activision Blizzard and the NBA in a very short span of time and These situations are both evolving kind of rapidly.

322
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,755
Rym: So I want to sort of set the stage by explaining something people don't realize.

323
00:21:46,775 --> 00:21:48,100
Rym: you might assume you talk about this on Twitter.

324
00:21:49,103 --> 00:22:13,468
Rym: The video game industry and to a large extent the tabletop board game industry in the entire world Regardless of whether or not they talk about it follow most of the Chinese censorship rules Because the reality is you either sell your games in China if you're a big company or manufacture your games in China if you are most tabletop game publishers or You're done like.

325
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:15,158
Rym: you can't make money like that's how the world is.

326
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:27,380
Rym: People whether we like it or not whether we talk about it or not They tend to follow all of China's rules to avoid Having to deal with the Chinese government giving you shit or seizing your games or denying you access to the market.

327
00:22:28,002 --> 00:22:28,704
Rym: Like that's the thing.

328
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:33,060
Rym: that's why you tend to not see Taiwanese flags in any video games.

329
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:33,681
Scott: hmm

330
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:52,800
Rym: other countries pull similar shit like India does the same thing with if you show Kashmir the wrong way on a map, but Because of economic reasons big companies don't really care if they can sell their games in India But they care a lot if they can sell their games in China because most of these companies Might be in trouble if they couldn't sell games in China financially.

331
00:22:53,422 --> 00:23:02,251
Rym: In fact in many cases they might be liable for damages to their shareholders because of ridiculous and possibly out-of-date fiduciary responsibility Rules, I am NOT a lawyer.

332
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:06,868
Rym: This is not investment advice but That is the context for this.

333
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:12,345
Rym: Blizzard got called out because China Effectively forced them to do this.

334
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:17,822
Rym: Well, yeah, I got called out because the NBA I don't know what's gonna happen with the NBA All right.

335
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:18,707
Scott: So here's so here.

336
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:20,920
Scott: you didn't talk about what actually happened.

337
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:23,708
Rym: Here's the details and you read these stories for the like.

338
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:26,677
Rym: full details cuz we're not news we're commentary right.

339
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,002
Scott: so in the NBA Right.

340
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,459
Scott: I think is the owner of the Rockets I believe the king so right?

341
00:23:32,822 --> 00:23:34,268
Scott: Or is the coach of the owner?

342
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:36,919
Scott: I forget I don't pay too much attention to the Houston Rockets, right?

343
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:42,504
Scott: The point is the dude made a pro Hong Kong Comment right.

344
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:45,732
Scott: and then Houston Rockets are the most popular.

345
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,680
Scott: and not only is basketball super popular in China, right?

346
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:55,744
Scott: The Houston Rockets are the most popular NBA team in China because that's a team Yao Ming played for a lot of sponsorship deals in China.

347
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:57,120
Scott: right Yao Ming is a big duty.

348
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:58,120
Scott: It's like yeah.

349
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,320
Scott: You remember the super tall Chinese dude who came and played basketball for a little bit and then went back to China.

350
00:24:02,762 --> 00:24:05,013
Scott: He basically runs basketball in China.

351
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:05,335
Scott: Now.

352
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:06,420
Scott: He's a big deal that guy.

353
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:08,495
Scott: But yeah.

354
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,520
Scott: But because of this comment China's like well, we're not gonna broadcast any Rockets games.

355
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:17,300
Scott: In fact now, we're just now gonna broadcast any NBA preseason.

356
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:21,137
Rym: This is the company that streams NBA in China is ten cents.

357
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:32,273
Scott: Mm-hmm The same company that's holding seems like the ball seems like ten cent only exists to distribute Western things and make partnerships with Western companies to do Chinese thing.

358
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:32,533
Scott: pretty.

359
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,378
Scott: it seems like that's all that company does.

360
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:37,514
Rym: pretty sure ten cent Made that like mobile Call of Duty game to sell in China.

361
00:24:37,735 --> 00:24:41,540
Rym: There is a Like it or not home video game companies.

362
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:41,821
Rym: Like.

363
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:47,340
Rym: the only way to really make money is to make mobile versions of your IP and sell that in China through ten cent.

364
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:48,043
Rym: Like.

365
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,047
Rym: that's how you make money.

366
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,120
Scott: It's like every time it's like, oh, yeah, we're gonna work with ten cent to do stuff.

367
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:53,168
Scott: Okay, whatever.

368
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:53,753
Scott: It's so.

369
00:24:53,773 --> 00:25:02,660
Rym: the Chinese basketball Relationship with the Rockets like Merchandise is no longer allowed to be sold on Alibaba like all sorts of shit went down.

370
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:05,334
Scott: So now the NBA has to skirt this line.

371
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:14,900
Scott: It's like, okay Well, we don't want to condemn this guy for saying something that's a right Yeah, but be in America where you have freedom of speech, right?

372
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,099
Scott: But see if we don't do anything about this, we're gonna lose a fuck ton of money.

373
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:24,100
Rym: Yeah, we were like to the point that it might be a problem for the NBA.

374
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,421
Rym: Right.

375
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,625
Scott: The NBA is long-term.

376
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:30,160
Scott: plans are basically to like have real NBA teams in China and make it a real thing.

377
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:41,640
Scott: Oh and before we you know Worldwide League and that this is there's one person making one off-hand comment Can like screw that whole thing like a bill a multi-billion dollar comment.

378
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:46,835
Rym: The NHL actually has a similar strategy because hockey is getting popular in China.

379
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:51,884
Scott: There was a. there was a CWHL women's hockey team in China All right.

380
00:25:52,105 --> 00:25:59,193
Rym: There's also you've noticed in a lot of Rangers games and other hockey games You'll actually see various Chinese firms buying ads in the games.

381
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:01,040
Rym: Oftentimes those ads are even in Chinese.

382
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:02,184
Rym: Like.

383
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:05,408
Scott: I don't think hockey's that big in China Yeah, but it's it's really big.

384
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:11,640
Scott: as far as I can tell if you're a sports league You're trying to make you know, Chinese people care about your thing.

385
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:17,440
Rym: I'm not an expert but as best I can tell hockey is really big among upper-class people in certain parts of China.

386
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:19,451
Rym: I mean, I'm sure healthy people like cocky there.

387
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,060
Scott: I mean wealthy people around the world.

388
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:26,120
Rym: I mean hockey is a very like wealthy person sport for a lot of you have to be healthy to play hockey.

389
00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:27,646
Scott: Yeah, you need an ice rink.

390
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:29,635
Scott: You need skates and all this other shit.

391
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:30,338
Scott: It's not like soccer.

392
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:30,900
Scott: Anyone can play.

393
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:39,023
Scott: Anyway, so with Hearthstone and Blizzard what happened was this is dude Blitz something.

394
00:26:39,043 --> 00:26:39,566
Scott: What's his name?

395
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:41,915
Rym: Oh, this dude is my hero.

00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:42,940
Scott: Yeah blitz chung, right?

397
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,753
Scott: So this is a Hearthstone guy that I had known.

398
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:45,660
Scott: I just knew his name.

399
00:26:45,741 --> 00:26:47,899
Scott: I knew he was a Hearthstone player, but I didn't know anything else about him.

400
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,010
Scott: And basically he was at a Hearthstone tournament.

401
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,336
Scott: I think did he win me?

402
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,020
Scott: I think he might have won.

403
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:53,604
Scott: I'm not sure.

404
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,780
Rym: he won a match in the Grand Masters, right?

405
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,386
Scott: He won a match and then there was a an interview and at the interview He was just like yeah Hong Kong.

406
00:27:01,446 --> 00:27:02,028
Rym: Whoo.

407
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:13,340
Rym: He said the thing that is like super illegal to say in China Yeah, liberate Hong Kong revolution of our time and he wore goggles and a face mask in solidarity with the protesters, right?

408
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,437
Scott: He's basically like yeah, let's go Hong Kong you know with his which is what I recommend pretty much anyone do.

409
00:27:19,457 --> 00:27:25,000
Scott: if You manage to get put on a stage and you get a mic with enough ears, right?

410
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:27,169
Scott: Do not take that for granted.

411
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,000
Scott: don't use it what it's intended to be used for right?

412
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:35,187
Scott: It's like if you win an Oscar don't go up and be like, oh, thanks so-and-so you should do it.

413
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:41,836
Scott: many other people have done and use your Moments of nationally broadcast television in the most effective way possible.

414
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:44,345
Rym: Yep, right Their health care.

415
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:48,540
Scott: if you win an Olympic gold medal, you know, go ahead and raise up your fist.

416
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,848
Scott: You only got one shot.

417
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:50,332
Scott: Don't wait.

418
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:51,560
Scott: You got this opportunity.

419
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:53,105
Scott: Don't fucking waste it.

420
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:55,675
Scott: and anyone who doesn't waste it you're badass.

421
00:27:55,735 --> 00:27:56,397
Scott: I root for you.

422
00:27:56,618 --> 00:27:57,060
Scott: good job.

423
00:27:58,361 --> 00:28:14,187
Scott: So anyway, this guy wisely did not waste his opportunity while many many people were watching him on Twitch and other places around the world And then as a result blizzard a Denied him all his winnings from hearthstone this year.

424
00:28:14,348 --> 00:28:21,503
Rym: the reef of all the things blizzard did are partly because ten cent owns a chunk of blizzard and Blizzard isn't just blizzard.

425
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:23,207
Rym: blizzard is Activision blizzard.

426
00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:25,914
Rym: Activision uses ten cent to make money in China.

427
00:28:26,034 --> 00:28:28,420
Scott: Yep, and he's banned from hearthstone.

428
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,152
Scott: and Now what's happening is blizzards between a rock and a hard place.

429
00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:36,078
Scott: because on the one hand, right?

430
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:48,999
Rym: If they don't do this they're gonna get like all the blizzard games could just get booted out of China like literally half the overwatch league will disappear and Activism blizzard may not even be able to sustain the league anymore, right?

431
00:28:49,382 --> 00:28:59,086
Scott: And also on the other hand If you look at say the blizzard reddit the hearthstone reddit any of the right if they do this They're gonna lose the American team.

432
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:06,100

Scott: Every voice is to be listened to or something every every voice should be heard something like that.

436
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,086
Scott: Yeah, they were.

437
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,280
Scott: basically it's on the American side.

00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:19,546
Scott: Everyone's just like.

00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:20,712

Scott: All right, just like oh fuck that the end.

443
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:30,930
Scott: Yep.

444
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:41,020
Scott: So, you know on the what you see it even Politicians in America right even bad Republican ones are say I end the Democratic ones.

445
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:47,353
Scott: I saw at least one Republican and one Democratic senator Commenting on like even blizzard specifically just MBA.

446
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:52,731
Rym: when the US government says the right thing It's either the Democrats or the Democrats and the Republicans.

447
00:29:52,812 --> 00:29:53,976
Rym: It's never just the Republicans.

448
00:29:53,996 --> 00:29:55,140
Rym: They've never said the right thing.

449
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,515
Rym: They don't say the right thing on their own But but they both agree that this is trouble.

450
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:06,559
Scott: They're basically like yeah China uses its threat of you know, cutting you off from their market, right?

451
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,659
Scott: to control your behavior.

452
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:14,798
Rym: And that is not worse because most tabletop games are manufactured in China.

453
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:15,960
Scott: China has a history.

454
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,462
Scott: Well, we did.

455
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,015
Scott: I don't know if we did a news on it, but there was a call.

456
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:19,900
Scott: He's that game.

457
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:23,343
Scott: Yeah, there was a call of Cthulhu Supplement.

458
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:27,240
Scott: I think that was being printed in China and I think I had the issue with the maps.

459
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:28,537
Scott: I think we did do news on this.

460
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:30,491
Scott: It had map issues.

461
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:35,213
Scott: right with regards to the you know Those islands that China cares about for I don't know fucking reason.

462
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:35,997
Scott: just get over it.

463
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:37,900
Scott: Jesus Christ anyway.

464
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:43,938
Scott: As a result they that RPG was not ever shipped to the u.s.

465
00:30:45,102 --> 00:30:47,088
Scott: And all the copies are just burned in China.

466
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:49,777
Rym: and I will while I am not at liberty to give specifics.

467
00:30:49,797 --> 00:31:06,079
Rym: I Have been told of specific instances and seen specific Guidelines that were disseminated non publicly given to various publishers at various times over the years not recently This is often like three or four years ago that basically said follow these rules or we will fuck you over.

468
00:31:07,062 --> 00:31:12,447
Rym: Like you can't get around this stuff unless you Completely produce your game outside of China

469
00:31:12,507 --> 00:31:13,891
Scott: and don't sell it to anyone in China

470
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:24,052
Rym: or at least if people play your game in China you don't rely on that revenue and you do not interact with the Chinese government and you do not care if the Chinese government allows you To continue to sell there or not.

471
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:30,500
Rym: Mm-hmm honestly, I think that Non Chinese game companies have a moral imperative to not sell their games in China.

472
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:34,095
Rym: Yeah, I mean I think China does not get to censor the world.

473
00:31:34,456 --> 00:31:34,597
Scott: Mm-hmm.

474
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:35,119
Scott: That's right.

475
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:37,451
Rym: Us has done a lot of shitty things.

476
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:39,019
Rym: Our government is completely fucked up.

477
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:47,296
Rym: But the one thing that we've almost got right is that when it comes to creative expression there's freedom to make creative things

478
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:48,020
Scott: and

479
00:31:49,041 --> 00:32:02,859
Rym: The fact that the entire video game industry of the world has been basically following Chinese censorship laws Without even telling you this is not something new This is just this all being exposed to you now because they can't hide it anymore.

480
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:04,666
Rym: Esports is a global thing.

481
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:05,650
Rym: There are Chinese fans.

482
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:06,875
Rym: There are American fans.

483
00:32:07,096 --> 00:32:08,180
Rym: They're all in the same league.

484
00:32:08,842 --> 00:32:10,267
Rym: One side is gonna give in this.

485
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,872
Rym: there's no compromise possible here.

486
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:15,521
Rym: I don't think and I don't know how this is gonna play out Mm-hmm.

487
00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:27,005
Rym: I'm gonna keep playing overwatch because I really like overwatch but at the same time I Think blizzard should abandon the Chinese market and if that destroys the overwatch league as much as I love the overwatch league So be it.

488
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:29,800
Scott: Well, I think you know, there's a. there's a certain thing going on, right?

489
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:33,133
Rym: I own a lot of blizzard stock.

490
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:36,307
Rym: I would be harmed myself personally and financially.

491
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:42,885
Scott: you do something if you do something that China Chinese want.

492
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:44,972
Scott: China wants and you don't sell it there.

493
00:32:45,153 --> 00:32:46,156
Scott: They just sort of copy you.

494
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:49,124
Scott: Yeah, right and So it's sort of like.

495
00:32:49,164 --> 00:32:52,094
Scott: well, I can't really threaten them by denying them this thing.

496
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:53,418
Scott: They'll just copy it.

497
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:53,780
Scott: It's like.

498
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:56,720
Scott: It's like yeah, China kicks out the NBA.

499
00:32:56,961 --> 00:33:01,080
Scott: It's like cuz they got their own league right, you know, but it's like.

500
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:11,053
Scott: But are the people in China isn't there still some element of them being like hey You're denying us the best basketball players on earth, right?

501
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:14,849
Scott: It's like yeah, I like my Chinese league that I go to I like going to see RIT hockey.

502
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:17,921
Rym: Yeah, but but I Exist.

503
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:22,715
Scott: Yeah, if you banned me from seeing the NHL, I'll be fucking pissed.

504
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:24,018
Scott: It made this KHL teams.

505
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:24,560
Scott: They make money.

506
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,202
Scott: They have fans.

507
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:27,992
Scott: this, you know Finnish teams and Swiss Swedish teams.

508
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:30,080
Scott: is this leagues of hockey around the world?

509
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:37,807
Scott: You know the soccer leagues around the world, but imagine if like, okay, you know, you're in South America, you can see.

510
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:41,660
Scott: you know, the American cups all the soccer that happens South America.

511
00:33:41,942 --> 00:33:46,339
Scott: we're not gonna let you watch World Cup or Europa League or Premier League.

512
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:47,904
Scott: We banned those.

513
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:49,168
Rym: it's like oh, there's the news.

514
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:52,438
Rym: Apparently the team's considering firing Daryl Maury over this.

515
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,219
Scott: Yep That's the NBA guy yeah, but anyway.

516
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:07,794
Scott: So it's like there must be some amount of pressure that can be had from denying China Something that they can't necessarily copy.

517
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:15,614
Scott: They can't copy LeBron They can have basketball But they can't have the world's best basketball that we that is the United States thing.

518
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:23,639
Rym: short of a multi-decade Effort to build up a pipeline like all the things that make basketball players in America possible, right?

519
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:34,010
Scott: That's a long-term investment and it would take a long time for the Chinese Basketball League to produce a team That is better than the NBA all-star, right?

520
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,094
Rym: I mean dreams.

521
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:39,904
Rym: I think a long long time ago on GeekNights I talked about the the Global Football League.

522
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:46,159
Rym: that was American football played by literally everyone but the United States and how utterly amazing that league was.

523
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:49,280
Rym: Yes, Japan was apparently the champion for multiple years in a row.

524
00:34:49,561 --> 00:35:00,775
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, the point is I think that where possible right where there is some leverage like say NBA Right, the NBA has way more leverage than Activision Blizzard does.

525
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,240
Scott: well, yes and no, right?

526
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:11,040
Scott: So well if the NBA was to say fine China free stop Massacring those who eager people or otherwise no basketball for you, right?

527
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:14,020
Scott: I feel like they have a moral imperative to do that.

528
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,467
Scott: They aren't gonna but they should.

529
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,377
Scott: I would if I was the Commission or whatever.

530
00:35:17,397 --> 00:35:20,400
Scott: Yeah But think about Blizzard, right?

531
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:34,208
Scott: There's probably actually more people in China playing and caring about Blizzard games playing Wow store craft overwatch Diablo true, however combined however are People who need NBA.

532
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:38,920
Scott: imagine if we're just like alright everyone who's ever bought hearthstone cards in guess what?

533
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:47,080
Scott: We're shutting down all Chinese servers and blocking Anyone in China from accessing any server in any other country and we're kicking you all out of our eSports.

534
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:47,904
Scott: That's it.

535
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:53,889
Scott: No, no, no what Chinese people can do any play any Blizzard game You just all cut off until your country is better, you know.

536
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,099
Scott: exert that kind of force instead of just bowing.

537
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:09,220
Rym: the Trouble is what those people in China get way mad and do something or with the state apparatus of propaganda basically minimize the existence of overwatch in Blizzard.

538
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:20,613
Scott: Yeah, but I mean if you've been playing World of Warcraft in China for how fucking long and suddenly China is actually very different from World of Warcraft in the US I'm sure it is but it's still you if you're invested in a game.

539
00:36:20,673 --> 00:36:26,560
Scott: You spent a lot of years on it and You're pro, you know, I get this guy's, you know, the guy who quit hearthstone, right?

540
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,724
Scott: He's like, well, I lost four years of my life, but you know, he doesn't seem you know, obviously for him It's more important, right?

541
00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:35,400
Scott: Yeah, but imagine this is imagine if you were pro China, right?

542
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:42,160
Scott: You're a Chinese person who's pro China But you also, you know play a Blizzard game and suddenly it's just like up.

543
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:45,169
Scott: We deleted your account because your country sucks.

544
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:45,751
Scott: fix your shit.

545
00:36:46,112 --> 00:36:48,540
Scott: You may be that person would get mad and do something.

546
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:48,822
Scott: I don't know.

547
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:57,020
Rym: if they'd get that message though the message from the state Propaganda apparatus would be this this evil capitalist company is denying you this because they hate you.

548
00:36:57,502 --> 00:37:05,560
Scott: I mean, I'm sure also I would also both, you know before I got blocked in China I would disseminate messages to all the players and then go right.

549
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:11,280
Scott: It's like they would try to open up, you know, their Starcraft and it would say exactly, you know, right?

550
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,365
Scott: I'd sneak that patch in.

551
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:14,919
Scott: it would be on their computer before it got blocked.

552
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,840
Rym: Yep There's there's a complication here that I don't you know, it involves a lot of you know.

553
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,410
Scott: There's a lot of details and how you exit.

554
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,920
Rym: but I want to get to the main bit.

555
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,689
Rym: But there's a complication here in that Activision Blizzard is a publicly traded company.

556
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:39,340
Rym: Mm-hmm Denies itself a whole bunch of profits in Situations that I'm not qualified legally to give you any advice.

557
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:45,912
Scott: Yeah, I mean, but I. but the point is regardless of that duty I would just a ignore that duty right.

558
00:37:46,214 --> 00:37:47,940
Scott: and then it's like I'm a big CEO, right?

559
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,052
Scott: It's like okay the the board take and the shareholders take me to court.

560
00:37:52,393 --> 00:37:54,560
Scott: I would first of all a have lawyers and an argument.

561
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:57,460
Scott: I'd be like, well, you know, the American players are all leaving.

562
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,406
Scott: I had to do something.

563
00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:00,720
Rym: this is to be richer than you and a better lawyers.

564
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,529
Scott: Yeah, but I mean that's not the point.

565
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,660
Scott: The point is I have an excuse.

566
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,088
Scott: I would go and argue the excuse in court.

567
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:08,835
Scott: Even if I lose right?

568
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:10,380
Rym: It's like you did the right thing, right?

569
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,420
Scott: I did the right thing, but here's the thing.

570
00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:13,640
Scott: I can sleep at night.

571
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:20,339
Scott: And in fact, I would be happy because like well I fuck China good and I fuck these rich asshole bosses double good.

572
00:38:20,419 --> 00:38:22,785
Scott: most American made their shares worth nothing.

573
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:23,146
Scott: Fuck them.

574
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:28,840
Rym: Yeah, most American success gamer bros who just want to play their triple-a games.

575
00:38:29,502 --> 00:38:38,580
Rym: The trouble for them, I'm not saying we should give a shit about them, but without the Chinese market I think a good chunk of the American video game industry disappears.

576
00:38:38,601 --> 00:38:43,052
Rym: Oh, yeah probably because we're already in the middle of a huge bubble who played the triple-a games.

577
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:48,708
Scott: don't realize how much you're being propped up and Subsidized by you know, the Chinese.

578
00:38:48,728 --> 00:38:51,960
Rym: we're thinking about doing a Tuesday show on the price of games.

579
00:38:52,861 --> 00:38:55,719
Rym: That's a topic that we can't get into because it's time for.

580
00:39:01,324 --> 00:39:04,345
Rym: but anyway things Of the day.

581
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:07,755
Rym: So when I was a kid, I believed in UFOs hundred percent.

582
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,400
Rym: I thought it was for real me.

583
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,123
Scott: It was real.

584
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:13,320
Scott: I would go to the library and check out UFO books.

585
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:24,160
Rym: It was mostly because all these stupid shows on TV that I believed Yeah, stupidly and one of those shows the one that I think is primarily responsible for this for me was unsolved mysteries.

586
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:27,191
Scott: I didn't I mean I only watched that one a little bit.

587
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:31,508
Scott: It was more for me like these random Every episode of this.

588
00:39:31,528 --> 00:39:34,140
Scott: I watched all these like weird Roswell's special things.

589
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:39,782
Scott: I even when I learned about the FOA was AOL.

590
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:41,147
Scott: it was actually a page.

591
00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:44,660
Scott: you could send an FOA request and I sent an FOA request.

592
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:52,038
Scott: I did something similar on prodigy for Roswell shit, and then they the government sent me this big envelope full of papers I didn't read.

593
00:39:53,182 --> 00:40:02,479
Scott: It was like a huge ass envelope full of a ton of documents and I found that Documents when I cleaned out my mom's house recently and then I recycled it but only like a third of the mysteries.

594
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:04,465
Rym: that unsolved mysteries were ghosts or aliens.

595
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:08,699
Rym: the rest were just like murders and financial crimes like real crimes with real people.

596
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:20,706
Scott: and Yeah, the one I remember though The only unsolved mysteries episode I actually have a clear memory of was like ghost in a hotel that George Washington stated Okay, so I wasn't mr.

597
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:21,970
Scott: Remember I wasn't making up a memory.

598
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,753
Rym: That's a real episode.

599
00:40:22,813 --> 00:40:23,837
Rym: Okay, good.

600
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:31,675
Rym: All right The entire show is Legally for free just on YouTube for you to watch on their official channel.

601
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:37,892
Rym: nice and even better They did the syndication Episodes meaning they have the full commercial breaks.

602
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:39,719
Rym: Like if you're a nerd it really cares about that.

603
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,405
Rym: No, they really owe.

604
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,674
Rym: but the commercial break the cuts and all that stuff.

605
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:46,326
Scott: Okay, but not the commercial not the commercial I was gonna say.

606
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:47,412
Scott: how are they get the rice of the commercial?

607
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:48,680
Rym: because it's in syndication.

608
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:49,886
Rym: It's those episodes.

609
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:54,940
Rym: if they solved it while the show was still going They actually show you the solution.

610
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,277
Rym: So I was watching one last night and it was or watching it and I'm watching this piece of shit.

611
00:40:59,297 --> 00:40:59,980
Rym: husband who?

612
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,665
Rym: 100% murdered his wife.

613
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:03,452
Rym: Yeah, of course, and it's him.

614
00:41:03,492 --> 00:41:05,660
Rym: It's actually him and like it's real people in this show.

615
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,926
Scott: It's not it's not actors.

616
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:08,895
Rym: No, most of the people in the show reenactors.

617
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:10,642
Rym: They were not actors They were the actual people.

618
00:41:10,723 --> 00:41:15,236
Rym: Okay, so which actually is weird watching this like 20 30 years later.

619
00:41:15,317 --> 00:41:21,015
Scott: Those people are older dead Yeah, but uh, we're way older than they were and they're like, we'll never know.

620
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:31,674
Rym: and I was like that guy did it 100% holy shit, that husband did it like holy shit, and then it cut to the update and it was like Yeah, the husband fucking did it and we sent him to jail.

621
00:41:31,715 --> 00:41:35,988
Rym: and I was like, yes Yeah, the show crazily enough.

622
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:39,820
Scott: if you killed your wife, why the fuck would you go on TV to prove his innocence?

623
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,393
Rym: I get the impression they work.

624
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:51,780
Rym: they tricked a lot of murderers into literally being on this show and then they got caught because of the show because the crazy thing is Your case that otherwise could have been a cold.

625
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:53,910
Scott: This show you don't want attention.

626
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,980
Scott: if you committed a crime you want to be quiet.

627
00:41:56,201 --> 00:42:02,220
Rym: This show was before the internet and they legit solved a lot of crimes because people called these tip lines.

628
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:22,059
Scott: so a lot of crimes only get solved or investigated or prosecuted by even like even like the DA like the public prosecutors will find out about cases to go and investigate from basically Journalists investigative journalists some journalists and this is basically is investigator journalism, right?

629
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:30,500
Scott: So I'm independent journalists working for a TV station trying to make a TV show is looking through some records Trying to find cases that weren't solved, right?

630
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,620
Scott: Oh, here was a person who was as a death certificate of murder and no one went to jail for it.

631
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:46,200
Scott: Let's go get all the info we can and then suddenly it's on TV and then the prosecutor is it brought to their attention And then oh look we solved it because they actually put effort into it because we brought attention to it.

632
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,973
Rym: the funniest thing though, is that Emily never really seen this show.

633
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:50,760
Rym: So never.

634
00:42:52,662 --> 00:42:54,187
Rym: But the way I described it was like.

635
00:42:54,428 --> 00:43:00,752
Rym: so every episode will have like a UFO a Murdered wife of some kind of some sort of embezzled like.

636
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,779
Rym: I listed like that the cliches of the show.

637
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:07,560
Rym: Let me turn on the episode and it was literally the cliches someone embezzling a UFO from there.

638
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,992
Rym: So What do you got?

639
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:13,330
Scott: So this is dude.

640
00:43:13,956 --> 00:43:14,440
Scott: What's his name?

641
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,844
Scott: It's Dan Cordero.

642
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:19,737
Scott: Dan Cordero is a professional for top wedding photographer as as their job.

643
00:43:19,757 --> 00:43:22,479
Rym: All right Oh, this is so good.

644
00:43:23,002 --> 00:43:27,780
Scott: And if you know a lot of games these days, especially Nintendo games like Breath of the Wild has a little camera.

645
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:33,459
Rym: Yeah, Jimmy selfies I've taken in front of ridiculous shit in that game and you often forget to use it like cuz when you get it.

646
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:40,220
Scott: they like Teach you to use it and make you do one quest involving it And then you pretty much hardly have to use it really anymore in the game.

647
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,939
Scott: You can you get benefits from using it, but you don't have to write.

648
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:49,887
Scott: I barely used the camera at all in Breath of the Wild and then I only used it a couple times like alright I can use it to find items.

649
00:43:49,988 --> 00:43:52,480
Scott: And yeah, I was like I used it for a couple things and that was it.

650
00:43:54,629 --> 00:43:57,507
Scott: But yeah Mario Odyssey also has a camera.

651
00:43:57,607 --> 00:44:01,240
Scott: I think a lot of Nintendo games just look for the camera cuz it's gonna be there, right?

652
00:44:02,082 --> 00:44:13,659
Scott: And he went and says a photographer played Mario Odyssey and also used the fuck out of the camera with their professional photography skills and took all these photos of Mario's Odyssey.

653
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:20,803
Scott: and It's some really great fucking photography and composition Going on here.

654
00:44:20,823 --> 00:44:22,367
Rym: This is really fun.

655
00:44:22,668 --> 00:44:23,330
Scott: It's really great.

656
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,135
Scott: I don't know how much Photoshop was involved.

657
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,920
Scott: I think he's at least removing.

658
00:44:28,562 --> 00:44:40,333
Scott: You know some various things possibly from scenes or cropping definitely in certain scenes and things like that but in general Still fucking great job Using the camera in Mario Odyssey.

659
00:44:40,353 --> 00:44:52,675
Scott: I Caught you know, I did actually Think about doing this in some way because I know that like Just like general FPS games any game with a camera on Steam.

660
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:54,080
Scott: You can just use the screenshot button.

661
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:57,776
Scott: Yep, so there were times I think I took like a photo in Skyrim once.

662
00:44:57,816 --> 00:44:58,519
Scott: that was way good.

663
00:44:59,801 --> 00:45:00,483
Scott: It's a stuff like this.

664
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:08,168
Scott: I've thought about this in the past, but this person has taken it to the extreme Conclusive level that it deserves.

665
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:10,396
Rym: These are great and some of it like they're subtle.

666
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,540
Rym: They're just well composed.

667
00:45:11,784 --> 00:45:12,639
Rym: This is really good.

668
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,400

00:46:03,621 --> 00:46:06,553
Rym: I'm just gonna say we're gonna do cockroach poker and two other things.

690
00:46:07,276 --> 00:46:08,380
Rym: I bought the games myself.

691
00:46:08,481 --> 00:46:11,844
Rym: If you follow me on Twitter, you probably saw some pictures of the games We're gonna do.

692
00:46:11,985 --> 00:46:14,903
Scott: we should do ants in the pants a cootie or so Actually wizards.

693
00:46:14,944 --> 00:46:15,786
Rym: one of the games we're gonna do.

694
00:46:15,926 --> 00:46:19,236
Rym: okay, but I couldn't get the American fantasy wizard.

695
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,370
Rym: there weren't enough copies available So I got the German version.

696
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:23,739
Scott: Yeah, why would you get the American one?

697
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,512
Rym: Uh, cuz the German version was more expensive, but it says over and are you gonna?

698
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:36,032
Rym: every card has a name and They're all different and they're written on the cards in the German version.

699
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:38,520
Rym: I know what Scott Johnson is called now.

700
00:46:38,982 --> 00:46:39,746
Rym: Okay, they're all.

701
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:45,120
Rym: they're all like the king the banner like they'll have names on them All right, and they're way lower quality than the American release.

702
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:48,755
Rym: All right, like the cards are just like shittier stock and the colors worse.

703
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:49,940
Rym: Okay, like they're just bad.

704
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,449
Rym: Otherwise, okay, but it's gonna be a fun time.

705
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,211
Rym: PAX Unplugged.

706
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:55,539
Rym: I think it's my second favorite packs.

707
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:56,301
Scott: now It's a good.

708
00:46:56,321 --> 00:46:56,602
Scott: pecs.

709
00:46:56,883 --> 00:46:58,387
Rym: PAX West PAX Unplugged pecs.

710
00:46:58,508 --> 00:46:59,069
Rym: off pecs.

711
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:02,579
Rym: south a long gap pexy's those packs it.

712
00:47:03,324 --> 00:47:07,987
Rym: So as you know, we are a while ago reviewed a game called 1846 race for the Midwest, right?

713
00:47:08,027 --> 00:47:09,512
Scott: So though it's an 18xx game.

714
00:47:09,552 --> 00:47:10,717
Scott: It's a real train game.

715
00:47:10,737 --> 00:47:12,995
Scott: when people say train game That's the game they're talking about.

716
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:19,680
Scott: Right, they're games that you know often include things such as historic real historical representations of actual trains.

717
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:26,560
Scott: You got like operating around right stock the basic core idea of all these 18xx games, right?

718
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,080
Scott: I think we reviewed 1846, which if you are gonna play get into these games, that is the first one to play.

719
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,609
Rym: Yeah, do not start with this one.

720
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:33,172
Rym: I don't even know.

721
00:47:33,192 --> 00:47:34,540
Rym: I want to recommend playing this one.

722
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,430
Scott: We were interviewed we reviewed it in late 2017.

723
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:37,530
Scott: Now.

724
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:49,866
Scott: I've played a lot more of these games since 2017 And basically the core of these games is this really they seem complicated and they are complicated for the average person but that's because of reasons.

725
00:47:50,127 --> 00:48:18,240
Scott: but the core thing of all these games is that you invest in companies in One round then you the companies actually do business for two rounds two identical rounds And then you invest or divest in companies again, and you repeat this cycle of invest come work work invest work work and whoever has the most shares in a company at During the work set turns is the person who actually controls that company during the work turn.

726
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:20,172
Scott: It's like you know, the company isn't you.

727
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:21,420
Scott: it's separate from you.

728
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:25,400
Rym: You you have your money you and you run companies that you have a majority share, right?

729
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,560
Scott: So to win you want your money to be the most at the end of the game when the bank runs out of money.

730
00:48:31,022 --> 00:48:33,633
Scott: But you know, so you sometimes you control a company.

731
00:48:33,653 --> 00:48:35,220
Scott: Sometimes you might not control any companies.

732
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,253
Scott: You might buy a company that used to be someone else's.

733
00:48:37,273 --> 00:48:41,960
Rym: you might sell a company now It might end up with three companies in front of you and now your turn takes for fucking ever, right?

734
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,560
Scott: It's like, you know the companies go in order.

735
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,896
Scott: So it's like one company might go then it's someone else's company and then it's your company.

736
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:47,720
Rym: Yeah, that's how it works.

737
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:56,760
Scott: Yep investing and then The companies do business and then you investigate and you're controlling basically your investment decisions.

738
00:48:56,881 --> 00:48:58,458
Scott: Which companies do I want to have shares in?

739
00:48:59,147 --> 00:49:10,480
Scott: Along with Trying to make certain companies do well and make some do worse the ones that you have more shares in you want to do better So they spit out more money and the ones you don't have shares in you want them to do worse.

740
00:49:10,821 --> 00:49:12,809
Scott: So that's other people will not make as much money.

741
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:13,953
Scott: So when the game ends you win.

742
00:49:14,254 --> 00:49:15,640
Scott: That's that's all there really is to it.

743
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:15,925
Scott: Yes,

744
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:27,536
Rym: and if you want About like these details like what these games are like on like this higher level I will link to go listen to our old review of 1846 because that's where we talk about a lot of this in detail

745
00:49:27,556 --> 00:49:28,038
Scott: right and that we're

746
00:49:28,058 --> 00:49:37,349
Rym: gonna review This train game in comparison to other train games and in the context of I was about to say normal No, it's just a regular board game.

747
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:41,520
Scott: If you don't understand the other train games You're not gonna understand this review really?

748
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:48,580
Scott: Well, cuz I mean I was hard to talk about it and except using words that only people who understand these games will understand.

749
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:48,782
Scott: and

750
00:49:48,802 --> 00:50:03,928
Rym: the other thing I would say is that This game 2038 tycoons of the asteroid belt If you have never played one of these friend games before and you like the kinds of board games you see the game like packs I Doubt you will enjoy playing this game

751
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:04,370
Scott: right?

752
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:07,120
Rym: This game is not easy to play, right?

753
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:15,756
Scott: There is no reason for me to try to explain this game and simpler You know in terms to someone who doesn't know anything about these games because this shouldn't be your first one.

754
00:50:15,837 --> 00:50:16,900
Scott: and if it you right.

755
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:30,552
Scott: Only reason to listen to this review is if you already know about train games 18xx games and you want to know about this one, but the reason of that because I like what 1899 1889 89 is the Japanese my favorite one so far.

756
00:50:30,552 --> 00:50:41,691
Rym: 1846 is by like second or third I like in 46. but but the thing the thing I'll say about these games that's relevant here Is that they all have this fundamental problem of I don't want to say naive game design.

757
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:50,800
Rym: It's not that problem, but they are designed For goals other than elegance and consistency of their mechanic.

758
00:50:50,902 --> 00:50:51,414
Rym: They're eggs.

759
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,611
Rym: They're designed for the historical experience.

760
00:50:55,033 --> 00:50:59,709
Rym: people that people play them tend to like Very fiddly rules that have like.

761
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,779
Rym: there will be more exceptions to a rule than the rule.

762
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:12,070
Rym: like you really you cannot internalize all the rules to one of these games unless you play them a Lot and you play them a lot.

763
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:15,114
Rym: They actually break down Pretty poorly.

764
00:51:15,317 --> 00:51:15,479
Rym: Mm-hmm.

765
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:24,040
Rym: So the problem with these games for someone who likes to play normal board games Is that you can't just learn the mechanics and then start to play?

766
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:34,294
Rym: You need to be constantly figuring out all the exceptions and fucking with the rules and unless you have a facilitator Basically, these games only need a game master or an expert to help you play them or a computer.

767
00:51:34,315 --> 00:51:35,860
Rym: Yeah, we'll get to that.

768
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:38,187
Rym: Then they're very difficult to play.

769
00:51:38,227 --> 00:51:41,196
Rym: but that said I love the shit out of 1846, right?

770
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:53,320
Scott: Like I said that core concept of investing in companies Controlling some of them right and trying to make the most money is a great game and I still think you could even replace.

771
00:51:53,682 --> 00:52:00,660
Scott: You can and the best part is that simple framework can be expanded contracted and rearranged to make lots and lots of different games.

772
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,920
Scott: You could make the investment part simpler or more complex or even crazy complex.

773
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:07,993
Scott: You can make the operating part a completely different game.

774
00:52:08,013 --> 00:52:12,353
Scott: There's a game called a Should big city shoulders or something like that.

775
00:52:12,373 --> 00:52:13,920
Scott: I forget the exact name of the game.

776
00:52:13,981 --> 00:52:19,355
Scott: If you go to board game geek and type in shoulders There aren't that many fucking games with the name word shoulders in the title.

777
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:20,479
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna find it.

778
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,439
Scott: I think it might be city of the big shoulders.

779
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,898
Scott: Anyway, it's an 18xx game with an investment round and operating rounds the big shoulders.

780
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:31,535
Scott: I got it, right But basically instead of trains it's like a euro game.

781
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:36,157
Scott: in the operating part It's like you invest and then you play a euro game and then you invest.

782
00:52:36,217 --> 00:52:39,948
Scott: it's the same Right, well then there's games like Chicago Express.

783
00:52:40,229 --> 00:52:48,120
Rym: take the core concepts of a train game and just like Distill distill distill right anyway, our Paris connection.

784
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:55,680
Scott: So 2038. what it does is it gets rid of the historical part by putting you way into a theoretical space future.

785
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,400
Scott: We know we're probably not gonna have space trains in 2038 at the rate things are going.

786
00:53:00,062 --> 00:53:13,698
Rym: but if we did which already presents a problem from a game design perspective because the fiddly like fucky mechanics of the other historical train games at least are trying to model very real-world history.

787
00:53:13,999 --> 00:53:23,840
Rym: meaning if you want if you know something about the 1840s in the Midwest that historical knowledge will actually help you a little bit better.

788
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:34,022
Rym: I'm not a lot but like a little bit like you can intuitively play the game By doing the things that make sense as an intelligent human being looking at a complex situation Mm-hmm,

789
00:53:34,766 --> 00:53:38,425
Scott: and in fact if you do things that happened in history Right or you

790
00:53:38,445 --> 00:53:40,374
Rym: tend to play out the way they played out in history,

791
00:53:40,534 --> 00:53:40,775
Scott: right?

792
00:53:40,816 --> 00:53:41,680
Scott: They tend to play out.

793
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:48,686
Scott: So it's like oh, yeah that that rail line was built there from the Civil War Caused it to be irrelevant right?

794
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,191
Scott: and then they had to dynamite it.

795
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:56,740
Scott: and that happened around this year and the game starts in this Year, so if I do that at this timing it'll print it kind of work.

796
00:53:57,001 --> 00:54:03,220
Rym: So the games are almost more experiences like if I play an 18xx game and I lose terribly like go bankrupt or something.

797
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:09,916
Rym: It's still really fun because it's almost like I'm playing this weird Simulations like playing a Civ game just to see how the world ends up.

798
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:13,109
Scott: I've never won And I've never been upset playing an 18xx game.

799
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:22,000
Rym: Yep, but with 2038 It has that same level of fiddly shit from a fictional inconsistent world, right?

800
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:34,180
Rym: And the thing is the fiddly shit is So fiddly that it becomes Onerous the operating round of this game where you run the trains like my train goes here here and here to make this much money.

801
00:54:34,742 --> 00:54:38,359
Rym: It's really fun and makes sense and I liked it.

802
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:41,933
Rym: But as soon as it scales up even a little bit it is.

803
00:54:42,434 --> 00:54:43,920
Rym: it is a disastrous mechanic.

804
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:46,140
Rym: Like it is it is own playable.

805
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:51,980
Scott: So normally the way it works in most most of the 18xx games is when you actually run.

806
00:54:52,302 --> 00:54:58,635
Scott: There's a point at which after everyone's done building tracks and shit We figure out how much each money each train spits out.

807
00:54:58,655 --> 00:55:00,380
Scott: and what you do is you look at the board He's alright.

808
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:09,580
Scott: my train has to start at one of my spots right and it gets blocked by other people's spots and It can go in pretty much any track right?

809
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,265
Scott: My trains just can't.

810
00:55:11,386 --> 00:55:14,740
Scott: my trains can't overlap each other, but I have to care about what anyone else's trains do.

811
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,088
Scott: I just can't go through any spots.

812
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:17,255
Scott: They're blocking with their station.

813
00:55:17,295 --> 00:55:20,318
Scott: Yep, right So it's pretty easy to look at a board.

814
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:26,660
Scott: It might not be easy to a hundred percent perfectly get the best pot most money out of the trains.

815
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,264
Scott: Well, you're close enough, but you can get very close and once you get very close, it's like well What changed since last turn?

816
00:55:32,284 --> 00:55:34,069
Scott: Well, one piece of track was upgraded.

817
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:35,815
Scott: Well, I guess my route is upgraded by $10.

818
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:36,276
Scott: then, right?

819
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:42,318
Scott: I'll just run the same route again with that one upgrade and you don't have tends to balance to where it takes.

820
00:55:42,379 --> 00:55:47,900
Rym: it might take You a little while to figure out but that is downtime for the other players to figure out some shit that they're gonna be doing.

821
00:55:48,122 --> 00:55:50,041
Scott: It's not too bad It's.

822
00:55:50,121 --> 00:55:51,064
Scott: it could be improved.

823
00:55:51,104 --> 00:55:56,440
Scott: a computer should just tell you the optimal routes and spit out the money with no thunking whatsoever.

824
00:55:56,882 --> 00:56:01,380
Scott: But it's not so bad that you're it's a problem that you're like frustrated with.

825
00:56:02,202 --> 00:56:20,010
Scott: Yeah, 2038 the way it works is each train each company operates in order ain't no tracks in space Right going around with their spaceship mining asteroids and collecting or and but the problem Is right when it potentially refueling.

826
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:32,671
Scott: right when a ship's picks up or Right, it picks up a little piece of cardboard off the board of flips it over and now no Spaceship for the rest of the turn can get that or it's that turn

827
00:56:32,691 --> 00:56:37,260
Rym: might involve like five different companies each running Multiple spaceships, right?

828
00:56:37,380 --> 00:57:01,497
Scott: So use the first person sends their spaceships out and now you see which oars have been flipped over And then the next person goes and sees which oars have been flipped over and basically each person has to Wait for each spaceship every turn Completely rethink and refigure out the exact optimal way to get the most best oars Right with each spaceship.

829
00:57:01,678 --> 00:57:09,222
Scott: now And then you can't even begin to think about your spaceship until everyone before you has picked up resources with their Spaceships.

830
00:57:09,724 --> 00:57:11,810
Rym: this it made the game interminable.

831
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:18,196
Scott: now in one hand and the early turns is not a big deal because it's like, okay Well, this one picks up the only two oars it can reach and no one else can reach them.

832
00:57:18,678 --> 00:57:24,467
Scott: fine And there are also ways to stake claims on Certain resources and no one can take them.

833
00:57:24,527 --> 00:57:29,680
Scott: and hopefully you would claim the best ones and that way you can quickly just be like Well, this ship takes all the claim spots.

834
00:57:29,941 --> 00:57:32,780
Scott: You know thinking necessary because no one else can take those they're claimed.

835
00:57:33,202 --> 00:57:39,287
Scott: but you still get when you get better ships and more of them and Unclaimed spots or you ran out of claims.

836
00:57:39,307 --> 00:57:40,251
Scott: You don't have enough claims.

837
00:57:40,511 --> 00:57:47,290
Scott: those later turns in the game starting about halfway through Become a big mess plus it gets hard of that.

838
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:52,939
Rym: might have been that the way we were playing it because we weren't Fully versed in like there's no history to look at.

839
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:57,174
Rym: Yeah, so we ended up making companies in a way that was a little bit weird.

840
00:57:57,475 --> 00:58:00,615
Rym: Yeah the way the board broke down Totally legal though Yeah but totally legal.

841
00:58:00,655 --> 00:58:06,881
Rym: but It basically means that there is a trap where if the game evolves a certain way the game will take four times longer than it normally Would.

842
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:09,889
Rym: but even if the game performed optimally optimally.

843
00:58:10,551 --> 00:58:14,925
Rym: this operating around situation would still be a serious problem right and even worse.

844
00:58:15,427 --> 00:58:25,320
Rym: unlike say eclipse which has a very Elegant physical mechanism for representing complex resources this game gives you fuck all for physical bits.

845
00:58:25,642 --> 00:58:36,479
Rym: You could solve this problem not a computer But you can solve like a third of this problem just by having better physical Components and ways to track this stuff better.

846
00:58:36,882 --> 00:58:38,754
Rym: It doesn't give you anything to do this.

847
00:58:38,855 --> 00:58:39,539
Scott: another thing to have.

848
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,260
Scott: Another thing that contributes is also the lack of stability in the game and a lot of other train games.

849
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,513
Scott: There'll be a series of rounds where things pretty much stayed mostly the same.

850
00:58:48,553 --> 00:58:54,405
Scott: like the turn order of the company stays the same mostly, you know the Ownership of the company stays the same.

851
00:58:54,446 --> 00:58:54,767
Scott: mostly.

852
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:58,638
Scott: everyone just sort of operates and upgrades for a few turns just moving things along.

853
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:00,022
Scott: here It's like all right.

854
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:05,240
Scott: well this turn suddenly this company's value went way up, and it's going earlier, so that changes everything.

855
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:05,942
Scott: Yeah, right.

856
00:59:06,223 --> 00:59:09,355
Scott: Oh and now these all these companies merge into the asteroid league.

857
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:10,860
Scott: well that fucking changes everything.

858
00:59:11,463 --> 00:59:12,228
Rym: Right we'll get to that.

859
00:59:12,268 --> 00:59:12,771
Rym: We'll get to that.

860
00:59:12,831 --> 00:59:14,440
Rym: I want to talk about that cuz that part's really cool.

861
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,505
Scott: I really like that part.

862
00:59:15,545 --> 00:59:16,851
Scott: That part is really cool.

863
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:18,740
Rym: Yeah, there's basically you know in these train games.

864
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:26,907
Scott: Well, I'm just saying it contributes to the instability and that you have to rethink the Gathering a resource part.

865
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:36,034
Scott: every single time you're starting from scratch again Optimizing which or for each spaceship, and it's just this busy work.

866
00:59:36,075 --> 00:59:37,620
Scott: It's not even like decision-making.

867
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,024
Scott: I guess there's a little bit.

868
00:59:39,064 --> 00:59:51,197
Scott: you could theoretically take a suboptimal route with a ship to pick up resources to deny another ship Resources, but not in a super significant way once the board is full of asteroids everywhere.

869
00:59:51,217 --> 01:00:01,471
Rym: to complicate this There are ways to refuel ships so then that they can move even further if they move a certain way Making it actually a pretty difficult problem to solve and optimize.

870
01:00:01,511 --> 01:00:08,510
Rym: for like I even to give an unlimited time on a complex board It would take me a while to fully optimize.

871
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:11,560
Scott: Yeah, I think it would actually be hard to write a computer program.

872
01:00:11,661 --> 01:00:17,597
Scott: Yeah, we optimize The search graph would be enormous, and you'll have multiple kinds of ships.

873
01:00:17,617 --> 01:00:29,140
Rym: so when you're buying ships So I want the one that moves further and picks up less or the ones that are like there's way too many Variables for the operating round which should be the least interesting part of a train.

874
01:00:29,381 --> 01:00:34,116
Scott: It's not the part where you're making decisions, and I think that's a fundamental problem with all the train games.

875
01:00:34,577 --> 01:00:38,269
Scott: Is that the Part of the investing part of the game?

876
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:45,858
Scott: the stock round is what actually most Determines the victory condition which player wins which player loses which shares?

877
01:00:45,878 --> 01:00:47,002
Scott: you have Right.

878
01:00:47,323 --> 01:00:55,607
Scott: the second part of the game the operating rounds are our only sort of Secondary to who wins and loses.

879
01:00:56,069 --> 01:01:00,380
Scott: right they're important because they control how much money each company is spitting out.

880
01:01:00,743 --> 01:01:25,469
Scott: But if everyone's good Anyway, any good gamer can operate a company not optimally, but optimally enough that it's you know right and The actual decisions made during the operating round aren't as crucial to the actual victory condition of the game But they take a disproportionate amount of the time and effort and the stock rounds are usually Oversimplified and don't take long at all.

881
01:01:25,871 --> 01:01:27,960
Scott: so you're just buying and selling shares going in a circle.

882
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,645
Scott: It's real simple

883
01:01:28,947 --> 01:01:39,982
Rym: the really cool part about this game Which is why I really wanted to like it and this is why I want I want to make a computer version of this game and then fix a bunch of stuff, but 2048 2058

884
01:01:39,982 --> 01:01:40,604
Scott: and some

885
01:01:40,685 --> 01:01:42,573
Rym: of the other train games the

886
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,724
Scott: 2057 or 58 different time.

887
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,735
Scott: you understand different different spaceships.

888
01:01:48,258 --> 01:01:53,055
Rym: the Independent companies tend to be pretty simple and disappear pretty quick in this game.

889
01:01:53,477 --> 01:02:03,999
Rym: They're all way different Yeah, and you're running like real companies of privates, and there's this whole complicated mechanic where based on things I don't want to explain in too much depth because you can learn this game if you want to play it.

890
01:02:04,621 --> 01:02:09,959
Rym: They can either join the asteroid league or not join the asteroid league at some point in the future.

891
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:24,191
Rym: yep And the asteroid league then becomes this company, and there's a whole like system around this that is Really cool, and I really wanted to interact with that by playing the game more times Until I ran into the operating round deadlock.

892
01:02:24,231 --> 01:02:25,758
Rym: that made me never want to play this game again.

893
01:02:25,778 --> 01:02:27,891
Scott: Yeah I actually had the asteroid league.

894
01:02:27,932 --> 01:02:36,170
Scott: I was the asteroid league guy I know which made it pretty cool because like I started the game with one space company Understood that I could withhold or pay out.

895
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:37,776
Rym: We're like I had the option.

896
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:39,100
Rym: with these into these privates.

897
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:44,399
Rym: I would have done something way different right and you can also take a private and like turn it into a company early.

898
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:44,560
Rym: like.

899
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:44,701
Rym: There's.

900
01:02:45,022 --> 01:02:48,339
Rym: there's way more ways to form companies and do company stuff in the.

901
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:49,046
Scott: yeah You could start.

902
01:02:49,066 --> 01:03:02,066
Scott: you can make a growth company which is a company that's worth like nothing at the start of the game and Basically instead of joining asteroid league you'd start this little like I little startup who like ships like one good Basically and sucks ass.

903
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:05,460
Rym: it starts with no share value, but I bought those shares for nothing right?

904
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,913
Scott: But those shares were worth nothing because the company was like a guy with a like.

905
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:10,860
Scott: a true space truck is a galaxy trucker.

906
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:11,528
Rym: But I didn't.

907
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:21,160
Scott: and then it Theoretically if you start one early enough and work on it and work on it That can work out to end up being like a big-ass awesome company, and that's what I didn't understand.

908
01:03:21,643 --> 01:03:23,555
Rym: I kept paying out because I had our.

909
01:03:23,635 --> 01:03:25,465
Rym: I had ice finder Which was a really like.

910
01:03:25,525 --> 01:03:28,879
Rym: it was making a shit ton of money for a private because the way I'd set it up.

911
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,780
Rym: So I was making all this money, and I was paying out dividends to myself, and it was awesome.

912
01:03:33,263 --> 01:03:34,472
Rym: I didn't realize I could withhold.

913
01:03:34,613 --> 01:03:36,261
Rym: even in these privates I Will.

914
01:03:36,281 --> 01:03:40,480
Rym: if I'd known that I would have withheld and I would have gotten a couple of fewer shares of like the other company.

915
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,122
Scott: We're just having a discussion about how it should be illegal to withhold and companies should have to pay out dividends and the profits You do.

916
01:03:46,404 --> 01:03:51,624
Rym: oh, yeah, but train games are about your evil capitalist Corrupt system.

917
01:03:51,644 --> 01:03:52,186
Scott: understand?

918
01:03:52,407 --> 01:03:55,078
Rym: yeah, no I would do the completely unethical thing.

919
01:03:55,098 --> 01:04:00,680
Rym: yeah I would have withheld I would have turned ice finder into an indoor growth company, and I would have made Bank.

920
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:02,580
Rym: I played this game way different.

921
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:04,870
Scott: I had the asteroid league and it was way fun.

922
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,000
Scott: when the asteroid League formed that was way fun.

923
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:11,560
Scott: But the problem was is now I had to control this giant ass asteroid League and that kind of sucked.

924
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:17,496
Rym: So Chris in the chat says the asteroid League miners thing comes from a different 18xx game.

925
01:04:17,516 --> 01:04:18,740
Rym: That's more normal, okay?

926
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,263
Rym: Okay, we're gonna.

927
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:20,411
Rym: I want to play that one whichever one.

928
01:04:20,431 --> 01:04:21,579
Rym: that is our friend Chris.

929
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:27,463
Rym: You'll see him in the forum, and he if you see a guy hanging out with us like playing train games at Pax's It's that guy.

930
01:04:27,584 --> 01:04:29,352
Rym: alright Chris brings us the train game.

931
01:04:29,372 --> 01:04:29,673
Rym: That's right.

932
01:04:29,714 --> 01:04:30,980
Scott: I don't own any of these fucking things.

933
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:35,344
Rym: I I would well I would consider owning 1846.

934
01:04:35,344 --> 01:04:37,013
Scott: I wouldn't make one before I bought one.

935
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:42,433
Rym: I would own it to Start ideating on how I would make one because this game taught me something.

936
01:04:42,493 --> 01:04:44,139
Scott: just reader rolls PDF if I need to.

937
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:47,651
Rym: yeah I would play 1846 1889 a lot of the other train games again.

938
01:04:47,672 --> 01:04:51,403
Rym: I would never play 2038 again.

939
01:04:51,423 --> 01:05:01,640
Rym: no not not in its default tabletop form but a video game That was designed to feel a lot like this tabletop game.

940
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:14,427
Rym: But take advantage of the fact that it's a computer and have a little more complexity like these games would be more fun If you could have a little bit more complex stock market like if I could sell Options from a train company to other players.

941
01:05:14,628 --> 01:05:16,312
Rym: or if a player sell futures.

942
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:23,053
Rym: that would be fucking impossible to do elegantly out in the tabletop And if you made it too complicated it would just turn into sieve.

943
01:05:23,234 --> 01:05:30,960
Scott: or I mean there is a New York one I think that has a Selling short and stock market is a little bit more complicated.

944
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:36,491
Scott: But yeah like I said before The victory condition of all these games is mostly in the stock round.

945
01:05:36,531 --> 01:05:39,720
Scott: the operating round is like this separate minigame of optimization.

946
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:45,120
Scott: I would really like to play one where the stock round was more advanced and had more decisions.

947
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:50,940
Scott: It was more complex and the operating round was simplified and made more elegant and streamlined and abstract.

948
01:05:51,924 --> 01:05:59,229
Scott: And this while the theme and some of the detailed rules and cool Thematic things like the asteroid league and the mining.

949
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:03,000
Scott: at least the the the theme of the mining make it awesome.

950
01:06:03,563 --> 01:06:06,760
Scott: The reality is this the exact opposite of what I want in a train game.

951
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:18,054
Scott: it is the a much simpler stock market released a normal level of complexity stock market for these games and a Ridiculously tedious operating rounds.

952
01:06:18,376 --> 01:06:23,533
Scott: that are Have fun aspects, but just too many busy work aspects.

953
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,740
Scott: They take too goddamn long.

954
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,908
Scott: Here's the line to make it worth my while.

955
01:06:27,928 --> 01:06:31,180
Scott: and so it's like 46 in 1889.

956
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:34,852
Rym: It's like I'll still play those games cuz it's worth my while enough.

957
01:06:34,972 --> 01:06:35,173
Rym: Yes.

958
01:06:35,233 --> 01:06:36,337
Scott: The TDM is not in.

959
01:06:36,337 --> 01:06:40,315
Rym: 2038 is Impossibly tedious in the operating round.

960
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:44,730
Scott: Yep Alright, so if you want to play it get into these games.

961
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:53,380
Scott: you can go listen to our old episode of 1846 or go play 1846 or Yeah, you can play that one too sure but do not play this one.

962
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,370
Rym: Do you think that is actually better in a lot of ways?

963
01:06:55,491 --> 01:06:57,140
Scott: some ways do not play this one?

964
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:58,825
Scott: 2038 as your first one.

965
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:05,749
Scott: if you're super experienced with these games and you don't mind some tedium and you just want to see what The deal is there's a lot to.

966
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:08,019
Scott: there's some good stuff to see here in this one.

967
01:07:08,543 --> 01:07:17,731
Scott: So I'd recommend like you play it learn it Maybe not play a whole game of it because it would take too long or maybe you just have a ton of time and think is Even though like our game went on so long.

968
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:19,460
Rym: We got kicked out of packs and couldn't finish it, right?

969
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:24,440
Scott: I would not recommend this one though for serious buying playing and replaying.

970
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:42,458
Rym: Yep, but I realized something fundamental the primary problem with these games Is that because they are tabletop and because they have very fiddly rules everywhere else They end up needing to rely heavily on Start player order and the mechanics to determine that are just terrible.

971
01:07:42,478 --> 01:07:46,374
Rym: Mm-hmm And it matters too much to be a terrible mechanic.

972
01:07:46,575 --> 01:07:46,756
Scott: Yep.

973
01:07:46,957 --> 01:07:51,440
Rym: That is the thing I think you could solve with all of these tabletop games.

974
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,837
Rym: You can make them more elegant without without ruining what makes them unique and different from the euros.

975
01:07:55,877 --> 01:07:56,660
Rym: We tend to like more.

976
01:07:56,761 --> 01:08:02,652
Scott: Yes I'm in favor of a Simultaneous market and not an ordered market because I learned after plant.

977
01:08:02,692 --> 01:08:05,822
Scott: it took me like a year to Scott mule mule mule Right.

978
01:08:06,023 --> 01:08:09,520
Scott: It took me a year or two to learn how important the priority deal is.

979
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,327
Scott: That means you go first in the stock round.

980
01:08:11,608 --> 01:08:21,229
Scott: how that gives you the can basically had you know You're having it at the right time is how you win the game and I've played several games of this and I basically got burned By it over and over that.

981
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:25,613
Scott: I learned it but got burned by it Even though I saw it and was trying to grab this one.

982
01:08:25,755 --> 01:08:26,540
Rym: I was the start play.

983
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:33,747
Rym: I basically had the start for the most of the game because it was a three-player game and neither you were willing to like Rust stuff and I did.

984
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:34,531
Rym: I just like I.

985
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:36,560
Scott: well now there was a game of 1889.

986
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:42,319
Scott: I played I think a magfest where I finally understood it and was trying to grab a hold of it.

987
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:43,247
Scott: And right it's like.

988
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:46,703
Scott: I understand it now, but I can't Can't get it.

989
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:47,466
Rym: Yeah, you know what that's like.

990
01:08:47,486 --> 01:08:49,814
Rym: It's like ooh, I understand this raging bull now.

991
01:08:49,895 --> 01:08:51,241
Rym: I will attempt to ride it Right.

992
01:08:51,322 --> 01:08:59,100
Scott: It's like I understand what I have to do in a video game Even though I know when to I have to push the button at that time But I keep pushing it and it's not the right time and I keep dying.

993
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:12,560
Scott: Anyway, yeah when we played this it was the first time where I finally managed to grab a hold of that priority deal mechanic At the right time move my trains and one company to the other force the shitty company on to Rym.

994
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:14,734
Scott: Yeah, right get everything in order.

995
01:09:14,754 --> 01:09:15,720
Scott: I didn't do it perfectly.

996
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:21,017
Scott: I could have done it even better, but that's just because I didn't understand exactly when the trains would rust.

997
01:09:21,096 --> 01:09:21,880
Scott: spaceships would rust.

998
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:27,500
Rym: But the problem is like Is also so important and also relies on the turn order, right?

999
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,149
Scott: But I could have screwed Rym more.

1000
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:30,496
Scott: but the point is that was the first.

1001
01:09:30,515 --> 01:09:33,129
Scott: it, you know It would regardless of which one he played.

1002
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:38,640
Scott: this still would have been the one where I figured it out Finally, because it's the same mechanic and all of them basically.

1003
01:09:39,701 --> 01:09:40,764
Scott: So coincidence there.

1004
01:09:41,225 --> 01:09:51,767
Rym: So yeah space trains is the only one I've played so far that I would never play again Which is a shame because stylistically a Stylistically a plus it feels very do.

1005
01:09:51,807 --> 01:09:56,959
Scott: all the characters and are and you know, everything about space wise is really great.

1006
01:09:57,581 --> 01:09:58,764
Scott: So that's a shame.

1007
01:10:02,614 --> 01:10:05,140
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1008
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:09,920
