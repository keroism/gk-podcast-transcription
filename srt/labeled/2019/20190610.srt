00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,042
Rym: It's Monday June 10th 2019.

2
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:11,724
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:17,780
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight breaking up all those Silicon Valley tech companies.

4
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:27,051
Rym: Let's do this so we both had a Bridge related injury over this past weekend.

5
00:00:27,553 --> 00:00:28,717
Scott: Just blow up all the bridges.

6
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:32,067
Rym: Yeah Mine is way less exciting.

7
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:34,736
Rym: But also so cuz being injured is exciting.

8
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:38,490
Rym: Well in the sense that Mine I was not injured that badly.

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:45,023
Rym: However, it said a president that badly I was set for a precedent of something that I didn't really Worry about.

10
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:48,277
Rym: and now the next time I'm biking over the RFK or running over the RFK.

11
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:49,080
Rym: I'm gonna worry about it.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,400
Scott: I'm always worried about the area with no fence cuz you could just fall right over into the East River.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,605
Scott: And yeah, even if you survive that which you won't god damn you're in the fucking East River You don't want to survive.

14
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,634
Rym: So, uh, I looked into that.

15
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:03,094
Rym: No one has ever Fallen off of that.

16
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:05,807
Rym: good It the center of gravity.

17
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:08,339
Rym: or if you're on a bike, you're not going to fall off the RFK.

18
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,456
Rym: That is not the problem.

19
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:09,700
Rym: good.

20
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:15,260
Scott: But so I was running still really weird because I think it's the only bridge that like doesn't have a big fence on the side.

21
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:16,284
Rym: I like it that way.

22
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:16,625
Rym: Like.

23
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,895
Rym: that's why I really like like the dangerous bridge.

24
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:21,651
Scott: No, I like the beautiful view And I don't jump off easily.

25
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:22,780
Rym: I don't think it's that dangerous.

26
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:25,160
Scott: Well, clearly it isn't cuz no one's fallen.

27
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:28,486
Rym: I'm sure people have jumped people have jumped off of it But no one.

28
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:34,355
Rym: I could not find any record of someone Accidentally falling off of that bridge at any point.

29
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:34,878
Rym: Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,040
Rym: So I'm running a half marathon and basically the first third gets me to Randall's Island through Manhattan.

31
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:42,230
Rym: The second third takes me.

32
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,238
Scott: use the use the little tiny.

33
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:44,705
Rym: Yep Use the tiny bridge tiny bridge.

34
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:48,480
Rym: the second third of this run takes me all the way around Randall's Island.

35
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:58,000
Rym: I do a complete loop including where like the governor's ball is The top part even and he's like I turn left over that bridge and go all the way around the full outside of it.

36
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,200
Rym: If you don't go to the bottom, yeah, I go all the way around it big circle.

37
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:03,960
Scott: So all the way back to the tiny bridge again nearly.

38
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:07,038
Rym: But instead of going all the way to the tiny bridge then I get on the RFK.

39
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:09,660
Scott: So you didn't go in a complete loop because you go the bottom.

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,818
Rym: I mean I could go a little further but then it would the total run to be more than 13 miles.

41
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,640
Rym: So and then the last third of it is I go over the RFK and back down in Queens.

42
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:25,930
Rym: So I'm running on the RFK and I'm in that last stretch where you're all you're like right next to the highway with a big cement wall.

43
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:27,962
Scott: Okay.

44
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:43,240
Rym: Yep, so I'm just running and suddenly I a rock flies out of nowhere from the highway and hits me in the shoulder Really hard like to the point that I stumble like backward and stagger and almost fall over.

45
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:45,798
Rym: And it takes me a minute to figure out what the fuck just happened.

46
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:47,726
Rym: Yep I'm just like what what?

47
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,272
Rym: and I'd like I pull off my shirt.

48
00:02:49,513 --> 00:02:51,440
Rym: I've got this giant bruise on my shoulder.

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,527
Rym: It's healed more now, but it hurt.

50
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:55,252
Scott: and then I yes a flying rocks.

51
00:02:55,352 --> 00:02:56,636
Scott: Yeah, you may look owned.

52
00:02:57,138 --> 00:02:58,323
Scott: Yeah, I look down It's no.

53
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:00,031
Scott: no you didn't get stoned cuz if it'd be dead.

54
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:00,975
Rym: there's a rock.

55
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:01,960
Scott: just got partial stone.

56
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,605
Rym: There's a big hunk of rock.

57
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:08,160
Rym: That's like three centimeters in diameter like this big honking rock.

58
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,284
Scott: That's not a big honking rock.

59
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:10,127
Scott: That's a rock.

60
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:11,571
Rym: It's a rock at speed though.

61
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,539
Rym: That rock hit me at speed enough to stagger I'm sure if I threw it at you.

62
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:20,839
Scott: So that's me throwing it at you with my weak ass arm.

63
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,820
Rym: Yeah, I do not want you to throw a rock of that size at me.

64
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:26,749
Scott: No, there's a reason people don't like it when they get rocks.

65
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:28,715
Rym: if it was made out of pumice.

66
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:33,297
Rym: I might allow it Get hit with that balsa wood baseball bat.

67
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,545
Rym: But what I was thinking now?

68
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:48,038
Rym: after you know after I recovered like fuck there and I started running again I realized When I'm biking over that bridge, I'm going like three times faster than I run.

69
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:56,567
Rym: I run at about 7 to 10 miles an hour when I'm doing one of these long runs and I bike 12 to 25 miles an hour.

70
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:58,734
Rym: if I'd been biking and I rock hit me.

71
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:01,299
Rym: I definitely would have wiped out probably.

72
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:07,828
Rym: So, I don't know how common it is that rocks get flung onto this path But now I'm gonna be thinking about it every time I'm over there.

73
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:08,490
Scott: That's how it is.

74
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,157
Scott: Yeah, it's like I think about a Tram-track every time there is one in the street.

75
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:16,024
Scott: Yup Yeah, so I was biking.

76
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:17,188
Scott: I woke up to.

77
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:22,428
Scott: my original plan was to go to the beach on the ferry and but since it's Too cold in the water just bike instead.

78
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:26,865
Scott: Yeah, there's a. there's a boardwalk called Jenkins boardwalk.

79
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:31,407
Scott: I don't know if it's any good as a boardwalk, but is that Point something in New Jersey.

80
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:31,870
Scott: I don't fuck.

81
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,171
Scott: Okay.

82
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:33,740
Scott: I don't even know if it's a good boardwalk.

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,680
Scott: I just found it on Google Maps and I said there's a boardwalk.

84
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,520
Scott: It has boardwalk shit as an arcade and it probably has like a hot dog.

85
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:43,860
Scott: So that's why I could theoretically bike to it eat the hot dog and come back.

86
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,920
Rym: So you're doing the typical bike thing of pick an arbitrary waypoint as an excuse just to bike out there, right?

87
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,952
Scott: But then I woke up too late so I can get in the ferry.

88
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:51,617
Scott: cuz you get in the ferry.

89
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:53,849
Scott: if you're not getting On the ferry date, you're not getting on the ferry.

90
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:54,110
Rym: Yep.

91
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:55,176
Scott: It's not worth it.

92
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:58,354
Scott: So I just said I'll take it easy.

93
00:04:58,395 --> 00:04:59,000
Scott: I'll leave later.

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,666
Scott: I'll just go to the regular beach.

95
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:04,218
Scott: that doesn't require any boating over the Abadobado bridge.

96
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:05,287
Rym: Yeah The one.

97
00:05:07,704 --> 00:05:10,600
Scott: Anyway, so, you know, I barely left the house.

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:19,760
Scott: I'm only like 10 15 minutes not even 15 minutes away from the house and going over the Pulaski bridge Which has a nice new like two lanes separated bikeway, right?

99
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,340
Scott: So there's someone biking in the right hand side and they're going mad slow and I'm feeling real good.

100
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,800
Scott: So I go in the I see that no one's coming the other direction.

101
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,890
Scott: I just like no one at all coming the other direction.

102
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:29,975
Scott: So I go in the.

103
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:37,194
Scott: you know, the raw the Left lane Passing lane right good, which is also the going the opposite direction.

104
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:38,639
Rym: I mean like most two-lane highways.

105
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,063
Scott: That's right That's fine, you know.

106
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:48,419
Scott: and I start passing the two the two slow people and you know, I'm just going and then suddenly Like I didn't even like know what happened.

107
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:53,720
Scott: It was like this rapid see like, you know, cuz like I didn't couldn't even tell what was going on.

108
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:07,596
Scott: It was like a rapid series of still frames like a fraction of a second and then I was on the ground and And I was like, basically there was some sort of flappy Cloth or like a sign or a banner of some.

109
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:11,226
Rym: it was definitely Probably there illegally.

110
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,089
Scott: I don't know it was.

111
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:25,300
Scott: it was tied to the railing between the bike The bike path and the road path, okay I think you may have been some sort of sign that drivers were supposed to see as they were driving past.

112
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:37,359
Scott: Yeah, but it was super old and tattered and had been destroyed over time and was going flappa flappa and but it was still attached with some amount of rope or something to the to the rail.

113
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:43,660
Scott: and You know, obviously if it had caught my attention, I would not have like just bike past it.

114
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,180
Scott: I would have you know, right but I guess the wind came at the exact evil moment.

115
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:52,269
Rym: It's probably been there for a long time Who knows probably bike past this thing forever.

116
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:58,040
Scott: the wind came at the exact moment and went flappa flappa And I don't know exactly what happened.

117
00:06:58,222 --> 00:07:15,460
Scott: I only have the evidence of the Aftermath, which is that I was hit my right side of my body on the ground but my left Shifter was like torn when it was torn and completely broken inwards towards the inside of the bike.

118
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:17,138
Scott: But it was the left shifter.

119
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:28,545
Scott: so maybe what happened was caught that it grabbed it and then my Handlebar must have turned left But then I was.

120
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:30,680
Scott: that that doesn't make sense.

121
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,354
Scott: I don't know how it broke in the direction it broke and how I fell in the direction I fell.

122
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:38,129
Rym: Yeah, but whatever Only had a GoPro he gets one.

123
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:46,910
Scott: I didn't have to go for it wasn't on though I don't want a film biking over this bridge for we could have done a nice frame by frame of that And it would have been just a shot of like the front of.

124
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,000
Scott: you know, you wouldn't have seen enough with that angle.

125
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,280
Scott: You know the two cyclists who I passed were like, oh are you okay?

126
00:07:54,661 --> 00:08:00,919
Scott: You know and I stood up almost immediately but my arm was all road rash or whatever near my elbow zone.

127
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,063
Rym: Yep I am thankful.

128
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:10,540
Rym: I have not had real road rash since I was in middle school I don't know, but I have multiple times scraped all the skin off both my knees like all of it.

129
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,539
Scott: Yeah, so I mean if my bike was still not broken like devastatingly broken I would have fixed my arm and then biked.

130
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,714
Scott: Yeah But I needed to go to now I need like doctor.

131
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,660
Scott: instead of going to the beach I had to go to the human doctor followed by.

132
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:32,059
Scott: So I googled for human You know urgent cares and there was one literally right on the queen side of the Pulaski like right fucking there.

133
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,471
Scott: It was open at four point something stars.

134
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:35,676
Rym: Oh, yeah, I know which one you're talking about.

135
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:36,600
Scott: It was like forest something.

136
00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:37,760
Scott: Yeah, I went in there.

137
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,720
Scott: That was like the best doctor I ever been to in the United States in my life the private urgent cares in New York.

138
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:45,351
Scott: I mean it cost $75, but that's not their fault.

139
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:45,752
Scott: That's the.

140
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:47,660
Scott: my insurance is copay for them.

141
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:48,850
Scott: I just I walked in.

142
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:49,920
Scott: I'm like you take my insurance.

143
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:53,600
Scott: They're like, yes, I'm like, okay, I will sit here until you clean this wound.

144
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:56,360
Rym: So actually funnily enough I went to the doctor today.

145
00:08:56,681 --> 00:09:00,015
Scott: I went to the bike doctor and the bike doctor was like, yeah, you're gonna have to leave this here.

146
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:02,940
Scott: Yeah I call you and they didn't call me yet.

147
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,120
Rym: I was gonna take my bike to the bike doctor today because I just never to place all the cassettes and everything.

148
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,716
Rym: I haven't done that yet, but it's raining and I don't want to deal with that in the rain.

149
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:12,765
Rym: Mm-hmm I gotta replace it though.

150
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,052
Rym: I can't use my upper gears.

151
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:16,513
Rym: I have stripped that cassette Mm-hmm.

152
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:19,430
Rym: But I also went to the regular doctor to do something.

153
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,666
Rym: that now that I'm old and I bring this up only because a lot Of you've been listening GeekNights for a long time.

154
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:29,571
Rym: We're pretty old at this point relative to most of you Like we're in our upper 30s.

155
00:09:30,662 --> 00:09:37,340
Rym: so I went and got a Skin cancer screening where they take a picture of your whole body and then they keep track of hey did that mole move?

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,502
Rym: Did it get bigger?

157
00:09:38,522 --> 00:09:40,769
Rym: Uh-huh the things that you can't notice on your own.

158
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,788
Rym: Uh-huh, and that my company's just doing it for free So I can just do it at work.

159
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:46,792
Scott: Yeah, I don't think I need.

160
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:48,579
Scott: that's something I need to do like on my own.

161
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:55,505
Rym: Yeah, well basically from what I've gathered you're supposed to get it maybe every four or five years just from your regular doctor Not even a dermatologist.

162
00:09:55,645 --> 00:10:00,555
Scott: Oh, well, I mean, I just went to my regular doctor coincidentally like a couple weeks ago Yeah, and it say nothing about it.

163
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:04,720
Rym: So Yeah, there is a history of melanoma in my family.

164
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:08,093
Rym: Oh, so I have extra reason to do it like earlier than most people would.

165
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:12,013
Rym: but she looked and she was like, yeah There's nothing my biggest mole.

166
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:14,364
Rym: She was like, that's not a big mole That's all she.

167
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:15,693
Rym: I was like, this is my biggest mole.

168
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:16,720
Rym: She's like that's not a big mole.

169
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,580
Scott: I've had this big mole over here for like my whole life and it hasn't grown.

170
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:22,450
Scott: I think there's one on my back somewhere also hasn't grown.

171
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,941
Scott: Yeah, but the one time I had they're not big compared to the ones I've seen.

172
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:35,392
Rym: but the one time I had a bike issue like yours where something grabbed my bike and stopped it Causing me to have an accident was one time mountain biking.

173
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:37,860
Rym: I was coming around a corner on a hardtail.

174
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,743
Rym: So I did like a sort of a drift around the corner where I locked up my rear deal and spun it around and then Started going again.

175
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:52,880
Rym: and when I spun it around I bumped into a log and the log Had like some sticks sticking out of it and the sticks locked into my rear wheel.

176
00:10:53,282 --> 00:11:00,614
Rym: So I spun around the corner bounced off the log tried to go forward and the bike said nope I'm staying here and I just flew right over the handlebars like instantly.

177
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:00,915
Rym: Yeah.

178
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:01,980
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

179
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,840
Scott: It's like, you know, people are always worried about getting hit by a car and you probably should be because you will be dead.

180
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:15,117
Scott: Yeah, it's like every time I've hurt myself on my bike in my whole life child and adult is Because I just fell on my own damn self.

181
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:18,169
Scott: Yep Just falling down from some stupid shit.

182
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:22,064
Scott: and you know people talk about helmets like yeah, you hit by a car What's the helmet gonna do?

183
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:25,280
Scott: your whole body's mangled even if you avoid head injury and you know what you're right.

184
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:29,238
Scott: But you know what helmets real good when you're just falling down on your own damn self.

185
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:30,102
Scott: Yep I didn't.

186
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:32,132
Scott: I luckily didn't hit my head at all this time.

187
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,620
Scott: I just landed on the right side of my body.

188
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:37,111
Rym: The fall happens like especially if you clip in.

189
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:39,059
Rym: like sometimes clip messes up.

190
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,942
Scott: Well, it's.

191
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:45,160
Scott: I think it's if you if you get anyone who gets clips every single person falls a few times and then they're good.

192
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,489
Rym: Yeah, that's how you learn to do clip right?

193
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,276
Scott: Yeah, you should have a helmet.

194
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:50,180
Scott: helmets real good.

195
00:11:50,240 --> 00:12:01,409
Scott: Yeah When you just fall because your own damn stupid self or because something reaches out and grabs you some inanimate object or a flying rock comes at you I'll be thinking about those rocks now.

196
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,580
Rym: So anyway, we got some new helmet when you run.

197
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:06,264
Rym: Yeah Face mask.

198
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:07,709
Rym: Yeah elbow pads.

199
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,672
Rym: I'm thinking so.

200
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:15,959
Rym: I'm rollerblading again and Previously all I use when I rollerblade is to like minimalist wrist guards and nothing else.

201
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:22,060
Rym: I'll wear a helmet because you know, I'm in my 30s, but I don't wear like elbow pads or any of that nonsense.

202
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,254
Rym: thinking about getting knee pads just because old man knee.

203
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:36,704
Rym: yeah old man knee and also Road rash when you're in your early 20s knee pads, even if you're not, you know gonna land on your knee or fall down They're just useful.

204
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:37,548
Scott: It's real nice.

205
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:39,880
Rym: You want to kneel on something if you got a kneel down.

206
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:44,279
Scott: Yeah, you don't want to kneel down in the street with your knee, even if you're not moving at all.

207
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,384
Scott: Yeah, it just hurts.

208
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:46,629
Scott: streets are not soft.

209
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:59,628
Rym: Yeah, but I feel like now that it's like oh I can kneel down and do something like time I shoot rather than 100% rely on my personal ability to catch myself with wrist guards and spin to a stop Without my knees touching the ground.

210
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,182
Rym: I think I should actually wear safety equipment Partly cuz.

211
00:13:04,222 --> 00:13:09,640
Rym: bike rollerblading in New York is a terrifying prospect until you get to like the westside bike path or Central Park.

212
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:11,525
Rym: So there's a bunch of news.

213
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:14,917
Rym: the one we'll part talk about first is Apple Day happened.

214
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:15,900
Rym: There was a bunch of announcements.

215
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,976
Scott: So this is the WWDC Apple Day, which is the developer focused Apple announcements.

216
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:24,755
Scott: right things for nerds You know programming shit stuff like that.

217
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:33,559
Scott: Yep So the thing that they announced that we want to talk about the most yeah most of the stuff they talk about is like You know updates to the OS is right, you know.

218
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:38,760
Scott: Yeah I think new features new things that developers gonna want to include in their apps and that sort of thing.

219
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:44,400
Rym: But they announced and I was surprised they announced this a new Mac Pro.

220
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,031
Rym: Yeah, you may recall desktop tower Mac PC.

221
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:50,920
Scott: That is not a stupid trash can that can't be upgraded?

222
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,851
Rym: Yeah, so you may recall back in 2013 Apple released a Mac Pro.

223
00:13:54,911 --> 00:14:02,856
Rym: That's just this black garbage can that was Underpowered and cost twice what it should have and was literally worthless.

224
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:03,157
Rym: Mm-hmm.

225
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:09,580
Rym: So When this came out, I saw the announcement didn't even read the specs didn't even watch the announcement.

226
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,257
Rym: I just saw people on Twitter talking about it.

227
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:18,080
Rym: So I go to our forum and I say what I always say I can build whatever that is as a PC for half the cost.

228
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:25,427
Rym: Yeah, and you can and easily yeah, so I got some pushback in the forum people saying oh no It does a lot more you can't do it.

229
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,815
Rym: And for a second.

230
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:27,700
Rym: I thought what if I'm wrong?

231
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:29,026
Rym: I didn't look at the specs.

232
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:31,339
Rym: Maybe they actually built a powerful computer.

233
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:34,973
Rym: and They did another thing Apple has done in the past.

234
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:42,437
Rym: They made a Groundbreaking amazing monitor and then they made a kind of crappy computer to plug into it.

235
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:44,625
Rym: Mm-hmm That seems to be their go-to.

236
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:50,480
Scott: the monitor they made is amazing is maybe the best monitor That has ever existed in the history of Earth.

237
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:55,000
Rym: I mean back when like there weren't really for a lot of money, but what else are you gonna buy?

238
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,566
Scott: Yeah, like what else is?

239
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:56,969
Scott: that's it.

240
00:14:56,989 --> 00:15:01,860
Rym: That's the only one in the CRT area You could get like really high-res CRT is but they had their own problems.

241
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:10,749
Rym: But Apple has multiple times made like the next big leap in like a real LCD or OLED or whatever monitors.

242
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,828
Scott: if you look at like the absolute best most expensive Dell monitor It like doesn't hold a candle to the Apple.

243
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:18,493
Scott: yeah, it's like.

244
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:20,520
Scott: well, I guess they're okay charge.

245
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,324
Scott: But here's the thing.

246
00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:28,740
Scott: They made the best monitor ever and then they're like, okay You want to mount it to like your fancy arm like I have in my desk, right?

247
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,511
Rym: Oh doesn't just have a VESA mount on the back.

248
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,608
Scott: You have to buy a $200 VESA mount adapter.

249
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:39,180
Scott: All right, if you want to put it on a stand it has its own.

250
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:42,034
Scott: I guess you could get a VESA stand on your own.

251
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,519
Scott: but they Have a stand that hooks into its custom.

252
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:51,320
Scott: You know mount thing and that stand which is you know a fancy stand.

253
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,838
Scott: But it has all the same features of the stands that I threw out that were attached to my Dell monitors.

254
00:15:55,878 --> 00:16:03,174
Scott: Yeah They are charging $1,000 for this stand and that is the joke of the century.

255
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:04,838
Scott: That is the most Apple thing ever.

256
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:12,360
Rym: So I'll ignore the monitor because there isn't anything to compare it to yet, but the actual Mac Pro.

257
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:14,668
Rym: Looking at we don't know the prices yet.

258
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:15,692
Rym: Well, we do know.

259
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:17,320
Rym: not really we don't know the full prices.

260
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:21,371
Scott: The cheapest possible one is gonna be like six thousand dollars or something.

261
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:24,520
Rym: The indication was that the baseline one will be six thousand.

262
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,207
Rym: That's like the default cost without the monitor.

263
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:30,675
Scott: Yeah, so monitor is also gonna be like six thousand.

264
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:38,084
Rym: as a result my Argument that I could build this as a PC twice as powerful half the cost Probably pretty accurate.

265
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:38,686
Rym: even better.

266
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:43,320
Rym: the guy who does like that the guy who does all the production stuff for where's the article?

267
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,162
Rym: I was gonna link to.

268
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:52,084
Rym: I found an article on the verge and it has this pro guy who is like, oh, yeah Why would I switch to this?

269
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,175
Rym: I could build something twice as powerful as a PC.

270
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,640
Rym: Like he said exactly what I said.

271
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:04,180
Scott: That's pretty much, you know Apple's thing is like yeah, they charge like this, you know High-margin premium thing, right?

272
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:13,867
Scott: It's like and that sort of works when it comes to some of their lower end products because even though they're charging Say a little bit more than the competition.

273
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:15,832
Scott: It's like, okay, I pay.

274
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:18,420
Scott: what for the Mac laptop, right?

275
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,992
Scott: I pay an extra $500 but look what I get.

276
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:28,157
Scott: Yeah, that hardware is great But when you look at them high as you go higher and higher end, right?

277
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:31,893
Scott: I guess they must be keeping their margin percentages the same.

278
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:41,800
Scott: I don't know what logic they use to do pricing But yeah, it's like it's like oh to upgrade the RAM from 32 gigs to 64 gigs will cost you $400.

279
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:50,455
Scott: for $400 I can buy like a 1080 dude for $400 I could buy how much total RAM in a PC like 128 one.

280
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,680
Rym: So I did some breakdowns because they haven't really saw the pricing yet.

281
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,229
Rym: But I looked at the baseline because everyone's talking about this.

282
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:04,900
Rym: looking at the high-end specs because if you get the maxed out one It's got a 28 core Xeon running in a pretty low clock speed by the way.

283
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,505
Rym: Hmm like they'd like.

284
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:08,452
Rym: more cores means slower clocks.

285
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:11,844
Rym: You can turbo it, but I don't want to get into that That's there's a lot going on there.

286
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:14,172
Rym: But the 28 core server thing.

287
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:16,856
Rym: That's not gonna be $6,000.

288
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:16,918
Rym: No.

289
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:28,020
Rym: And the bottom one the baseline one in this $6,000 PC is an 8 core Xeon That runs at a significantly slower clock speed than the 4 core that I got in my computer.

290
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:29,548
Rym: So it's 8 cores.

291
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,900
Rym: you could buy that exact chip.

292
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:36,047
Rym: Actually, you can buy that chip slightly faster than the one that's in the Mac for 1200 bucks.

293
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:40,508
Rym: Mm-hmm The RAM 32 gigs of ECC.

294
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:44,240
Scott: right Apple is always a crazy about always using ECC RAM.

295
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:48,989
Rym: expensive anymore $160 bucks 32 gigs one module.

296
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:52,140
Scott: number one place that Apple overcharges is the RAM zone.

297
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:55,540
Scott: Yeah, they always overcharge for RAM and storage and all that stuff.

298
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,660
Rym: Oh the words are the worst part and I don't even know what they're doing here.

299
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:09,040
Scott: But my point is is that yes Apple overcharges, but when it comes to the high-end like this They're the overcharge ends up being many many thousands of dollars extra.

300
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:14,175
Scott: It's not like Oh $500 extra But you get a nice Apple laptop with a really nice screen in it.

301
00:19:14,295 --> 00:19:18,140
Scott: or oh you paid $50 more than the Android phone, but you got an iPhone.

302
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:25,285
Scott: It's like no if you want this, you know instead of the equivalent PC that has an Nvidia, you know board in it That's better.

303
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:29,305
Scott: You're going to have to pay $5,000 extra $6,000 extra right?

304
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:37,720
Scott: So even though maybe the margin percentages are might be the same because you know The really fast PC is still two or three thousand.

305
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:41,494
Scott: It's like you're paying the sum.

306
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:47,720
Scott: total premium dollars You are paying is absolutely insane and unreasonable and pointless.

307
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,703
Rym: How's it notice something?

308
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:54,120
Rym: the storage is SSDs and the baseline is 256 gigs, which is nothing nothing.

309
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:59,660
Rym: Uh, they say that it says quote up to 2.6 gigabit per second sequential read.

310
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:04,257
Rym: That sounds like SATA - that doesn't sound like PCIe or SATA 3.

311
00:20:04,257 --> 00:20:06,742
Scott: Yeah, it's not Like.

312
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:07,305
Scott: why does it?

313
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:11,882
Scott: it's even says it's like two two terabyte for you know SSDs.

314
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:18,520
Scott: to make a four terabyte SSD shouldn't you be using like, you know, m2 drives like MVNO, whatever?

315
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:19,444
Rym: Well, m2.

316
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,352
Rym: so m2 is actually just the form factor.

317
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:26,170
Scott: m2 could be a SATA 3 Whatever the hell that thing is called.

318
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,698
Scott: I forgot since I built my PC.

319
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,845
Rym: basically You want your heart.

320
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:35,520
Rym: you want your fast hard drives to basically be PCI Express cards that happen to have hard drives on.

321
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,280
Rym: That's really what you want.

322
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:39,739
Rym: This does not look like that.

323
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:43,670
Scott: No And you think it's so crazy Pro in every other category.

324
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,076
Scott: wouldn't the storage also be crazy Pro?

325
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:47,340
Scott: shouldn't it be like two?

326
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,773
Scott: Like eight terabyte, you know.

327
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,364
Scott: and VMEs Something really.

328
00:20:52,384 --> 00:21:02,957
Rym: I assume that they're going for the idea that no one's actually working from local files in an environment Where you'd use this that you're using the shared Thunderbolt, whatever, you know, that's the thing is like.

329
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:07,996
Scott: Apple loves External attached things but it's like no, this is the stupid.

330
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:09,120
Scott: This is the case.

331
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,147
Scott: This is the tower PC that you're allowing.

332
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:12,773
Scott: You're actually allowing people to open it.

333
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,780
Scott: They don't want shit on the desk.

334
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:17,700
Scott: Yeah, we don't want an external pile of hard drives.

335
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:22,559
Scott: We want to put like 10 hard drives in this box, but I don't think there's room in that box for any hard drives.

336
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:29,970
Rym: No, it's got a lot of Pro features, but until they release the actual Expansion they're letting you do is PCI slot.

337
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,319
Scott: This is really reminiscent of the Apple to GS.

338
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:37,000
Scott: So this so one of our people are making seem like they're letting you do expansion in any other areas.

339
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,209
Rym: They do have the.

340
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,914
Rym: the thing this thing is going for it Is that it has a lot of PCIe lanes and it has a lot of support for.

341
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:49,427
Rym: like custom Supercharged rendering chips are making special stuff.

342
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:54,000
Scott: So they made this special card you can get that will do transcoding for you.

343
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,540
Scott: So if you're editing video it you won't have to make proxy files.

344
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:06,151
Scott: You could like have two or three or some number of 8k files and play them in real time No problem without having to make proxies first.

345
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:10,500
Scott: because there's such a like a super fast dedicated Transcoder, I don't know.

346
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Scott: I'm sure a similar product must exist for the PC that you can stick in and it well.

347
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:16,851
Scott: You could probably still get a PC fast enough.

348
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:36,337
Rym: So to give you so give her a reference point Obviously the I my pipeline is simpler than a Hollywood pipeline Yeah, but when I'm editing 4k video, I usually have two 4k sources at very high bit rates and I can play them simultaneously Even four of them together in a multi-camera view without using proxies.

349
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:43,360
Rym: Mm-hmm And I get that includes the 1080 and yeah one 1080 and that includes no special transcoding thing.

350
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,213
Rym: That includes no pre-rendered color correction.

351
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:50,608
Rym: No multiple ATI includes color correction and stabilization.

352
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:52,513
Rym: what is and all sorts of transforms.

353
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:57,709
Rym: what it does not include to be fair is Color grading or anything like that.

354
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:03,019
Rym: that stuff I would do in post or I would do Destructively later or I do it in the render pass at the end.

355
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:06,452
Rym: But I'm not saying my PC is the equivalent of this thing.

356
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:07,355
Scott: clearly not.

357
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:11,009
Scott: but but this thing Dollar as usual.

358
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,040
Scott: It's it's weird to say this is news.

359
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:21,206
Scott: It's just this business as usual right the dollar per performance ratio of the Apple computer is Absolutely ridiculous.

360
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:27,269
Scott: You're like getting almost no computing power per dollar Whereas with a PC you get a lot of computing power per dollar.

361
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:33,105
Scott: this unless you're just like don't give a shit about money There's no reason to buy.

362
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:38,240
Scott: or you just really really really need OS X and yet afford it.

363
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:46,506
Rym: Like if somehow you're on like an Apple centric pipeline, I don't know Numbers of people who would need this.

364
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:51,480
Rym: they're probably probably studios and pipelines where this hardware would be really nice to use in that pipeline.

365
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:58,840
Rym: But there's a lot of pipelines that rely on software that's really only written to work with Nvidia high-end cards.

366
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,469
Scott: Well, that's mostly when you're not talking about like.

367
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,824
Scott: most of their demos were like art related right rendering, you know And it's like for those things.

368
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:08,275
Scott: I guess it doesn't matter too much.

369
00:24:08,335 --> 00:24:11,887
Rym: if you have Nvidia or ATI Yeah, but if you're doing like 3d right?

370
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:13,853
Scott: No, I think it's mostly the Nvidia.

371
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:16,985
Scott: situation is people are doing CUDA stuff Not just CUDA.

372
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:20,240
Rym: Nvidia has a higher end chips that are not the 1080 type stuff.

373
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,256
Scott: We right but the point is the CUDA people cannot go with the AMD at all.

374
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,160
Scott: It's like a deal breaker.

375
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:25,862
Rym: Yeah, right.

376
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:28,833
Scott: So if you're doing any CUDA based thing, it's like well not doing it.

377
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:29,275
Scott: on this.

378
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:32,447
Scott: you're going to buy an Nvidia So Apple can play.

379
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:37,297
Rym: they say that some of the companies like Let's see, blah blah blah.

380
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,380
Rym: Yeah, a bunch of the companies that have Nvidia only stuff have said they will rewrite those apps to work with AMD.

381
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:49,220
Scott: Many people are skeptical of that claim because how many customers are you doing this for?

382
00:24:49,753 --> 00:25:04,178
Rym: I mean I remember a long time ago when a bunch of Game companies went way out of their way to make sure their games worked on both Windows and Macs because Macs finally had video cards and none of those games work anymore and no one supports Macs.

383
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:06,103
Scott: and go back and Watch the Steve Jobs.

384
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:10,014
Scott: John Carmack, you know doom 3 keynote everybody.

385
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,140
Scott: Oh, yeah, go back and watch it.

386
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,056
Rym: I remember that.

387
00:25:14,284 --> 00:25:15,739
Rym: So, uh got some other news.

388
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:17,716
Scott: We do have another news.

389
00:25:17,797 --> 00:25:31,520
Scott: So Basically what's happening here is Chrome is changing itself in such a way that ad block Extensions will no longer be able to add block to the extent that they previously ad blocked.

390
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:43,410
Scott: And thus if you use Chrome Even if you're using all the best ad block biz unless you're like a special business client who is paying for like a special Chrome for your company or some ridiculous.

391
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:47,178
Scott: I didn't even know that was a thing until recently That you know.

392
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:54,879
Scott: Let's remove a lot of the limits on the kinds of extensions you can make because if you're a company you presumably have like custom Chrome extensions that you know, whatever.

393
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:57,608
Scott: It's amazing everyone listening to this.

394
00:25:57,628 --> 00:26:00,880
Scott: Yeah, your ad block is not gonna work too well in Chrome.

395
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:05,516
Scott: So switch to Firefox, which I've been using Firefox for a long time.

396
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:09,667
Scott: Yeah, I've been using Pretty much only use Chrome at work for work.

397
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:10,489
Rym: Yep.

398
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:19,333
Rym: I'm Just I've been using Chrome for a long time and I haven't had this problem yet.

399
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,560
Rym: My ad block is still working effectively.

400
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,560
Scott: Yeah, I mean I have pie hole and stuff that also does ad block by other techniques.

401
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:39,480
Rym: Yeah But it's part of this news just shows that no browser will last forever and win the so-called browser war Because the people who run these browsers will always fuck it up somehow and just a rotation of who fucks it up.

402
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:41,760
Rym: So right now the landscape is shifted.

403
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,857
Rym: There was a while where Chrome was the super fast browser and everything else had problems.

404
00:26:46,359 --> 00:27:00,033
Rym: now we're getting back into an era where Firefox is probably the browser that has the best interest of the actual user of the browser at heart as opposed to Google Which is conflicted because Google relies on ad revenue.

405
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:02,140
Rym: This will get into our main topic for the show.

406
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,320
Scott: Well, that's the reason, you know, why did Google make Chrome in the first place?

407
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,450
Scott: It's like because they can't you know, their business is the web.

408
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,201
Scott: They can't let someone else right be controlling Right.

409
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:14,850
Scott: Imagine if there was no Chrome and those only Firefox.

410
00:27:15,131 --> 00:27:17,619
Scott: the entire business of Google would like be dependent on.

411
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:20,210
Scott: like things Mozilla does Mozilla would have them over a barrel.

412
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:22,240
Scott: Yeah, everyone's using Firefox, right?

413
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,540
Scott: So Google or Microsoft would have them over a barrel because they're controlling, you know the web.

414
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:29,489
Scott: So Google was doing the right thing to have control there.

415
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,496
Scott: Otherwise their business is just boned.

416
00:27:31,696 --> 00:27:32,800
Rym: Yeah, they were doing the right thing.

417
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,948
Rym: There's got to be competition like multiple browsers.

418
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,360
Rym: No one has a monopoly on the most important app on your computer.

419
00:27:39,262 --> 00:27:55,760
Rym: But at the same time all these companies need to make money and have various interests and various monetary streams that they have to protect and Google is gonna start protecting their stream more and more and they're gonna probably prevent us from blocking ads in the long run.

420
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:57,820
Rym: Hmm, so we gotta search Firefox.

421
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:06,764
Rym: Firefox seems to have gotten ahead of this in that Firefox has really been branding themselves more and more as the secure Private browser.

422
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:11,659
Scott: a lot of their stuff is like all their iOS apps are like privacy related apps and stuff.

423
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:17,218
Rym: Yep, cuz you don't want to trust any of those like weird browsers made by the crazy people.

424
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:26,560
Rym: No yeah, so I feel like in our foreseeable future Smart people will all be switching to Firefox and Firefox will have the most please in it.

425
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,438
Scott: Yeah, I only went to Chrome for a limited time.

426
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:34,740
Rym: Yep I haven't moved yet because like I said my head my Firefox since you know, it was Phoenix.

427
00:28:35,442 --> 00:28:38,048
Rym: I remember using Phoenix and Firebird for a brief time.

428
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:38,509
Scott: That's right.

429
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:41,717
Rym: So keep an eye out if you start seeing ads in Chrome.

430
00:28:41,737 --> 00:28:44,968
Rym: Ah That's your signal to go move to Firefox.

431
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:45,369
Rym: Mm-hmm.

432
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:49,992
Scott: Also, the correct ad block extension is you micro block origin.

433
00:28:50,072 --> 00:28:54,006
Scott: It's it's you know, it's not the word micro It's the little you know, it's all.

434
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:57,678
Rym: you lower lowercase you with or without the little thing lowercase mu.

435
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:02,980
Rym: Yeah Do not download random ad blocker because ad blockers can inspect your content.

436
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:06,500
Rym: You better trust that could be people who made that ad blocker.

437
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:07,080
Rym: You're in trouble.

438
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,485
Scott: You can also set a pie hole on your home network and you can even VPN into your home network to get behind your pie Hole when you're not home.

439
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:16,206
Rym: Yeah, the most important thing is however you do it you gotta block ads.

440
00:29:16,286 --> 00:29:21,747
Rym: ads are a security threat and they're also a Violence against your brain shall we say?

441
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:24,415
Scott: block all ads everywhere always.

442
00:29:24,836 --> 00:29:27,649
Scott: if I know exceptions No such thing as a good ad.

443
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:29,098
Scott: I got to support someone.

444
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,223
Scott: no Fuck you.

445
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,109
Scott: block all ads everywhere always.

446
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:37,129
Rym: if I could install an extension in my glasses that just blanked out any Advertisements I saw in the real world.

447
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:37,673
Rym: I would do it.

448
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:38,478
Scott: I would pay for that.

449
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:46,257
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

450
00:29:46,357 --> 00:29:49,865
Rym: so when I first got a PC and I started getting PC games.

451
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:54,700
Rym: I did not know Piracy was a thing people in school.

452
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,024
Rym: I didn't really me floppy.

453
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,710
Rym: this be like, oh you got a computer here.

454
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:58,875
Rym: Check out this racing game.

455
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:00,322
Scott: Yeah, I didn't really you know, it's like.

456
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:01,970
Scott: I didn't quite understand the concept.

457
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:04,041
Scott: Like it's like oh you do have software.

458
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:05,850
Scott: you can copy it and you give it to someone else.

459
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,886
Scott: It's like this is what software?

460
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:08,370
Scott: just the thing.

461
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:10,296
Scott: I didn't really even understand.

462
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:15,190
Scott: all the shareware and then like typing codes like using the star control chart to get the game.

463
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,514
Scott: And then that I finally understood.

464
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,862
Scott: Oh, I see what's going on here.

465
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:20,025
Scott: Someone made this game.

466
00:30:20,046 --> 00:30:21,350
Scott: They want to charge me for it.

467
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,527
Scott: Yeah, I get it.

468
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:30,979
Rym: And but I learned pretty quick and then I got involved in the where scene because I Have no fucking money when I'm a little kid.

469
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,345
Scott: Yeah, it was no steam.

470
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:33,310
Rym: So I had a crack copy.

471
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:36,050
Scott: Was it even hard to go to the game store?

472
00:30:36,411 --> 00:30:38,522
Rym: I had stunts 40 racing cracked by kill fit.

473
00:30:38,623 --> 00:30:46,470
Rym: most of my games had Screens in the beginning that showed the cracking group that cracked the games that you could play it without needing the manual.

474
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:47,968
Scott: Oh, I just did other means.

475
00:30:48,812 --> 00:30:53,750
Scott: Yeah, I I knew people like hey give me the doom wad file so I don't have to use the shareware one.

476
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:57,577
Rym: Yep, it's crazy Like the internet was so different back then.

477
00:30:57,617 --> 00:31:07,050
Rym: that was an era when I would literally go to someone's BBS download an exe file Trust it run it and it didn't have any malware.

478
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,004
Scott: Well, but yeah, but also it's like what was there on your computer - yeah.

479
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,530
Scott: Oh, no, you got my school paper.

480
00:31:12,934 --> 00:31:13,984
Rym: Yeah, most malware.

481
00:31:14,045 --> 00:31:17,539
Scott: back then You got my stone but you stole my copy of chips.

482
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:20,370
Rym: challenge, oh you deleted my hard drive.

483
00:31:20,571 --> 00:31:29,614
Rym: I guess I lost 500 megabytes of data and have to reinstall Windows 3 1 1.

484
00:31:29,614 --> 00:31:36,236
Rym: So, uh There was copy protection on a lot of these games but one game in particular This game called dungeon master.

485
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:39,127
Rym: If you look at this video, you'll you'll know what game this is.

486
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:39,970
Rym: You've seen this game.

487
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:45,383
Rym: It was even ported to the NES And in fact how it was ported to the NES which is talked about in my thing of the day.

488
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:52,310
Rym: video is pretty crazy because It has raster images, which is not how the NES renders video.

489
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:54,736
Rym: So there's this crazy chip on.

490
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:58,428
Rym: it was hard to emulate but this video goes into detail on how?

491
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:11,510
Rym: Some of the most effective copy protection to prevent pirates from stealing games in the floppy era worked and usually it would work In such a way to where people who pirated the game and cracked it would think they had succeeded.

492
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:15,410
Rym: But after you played the game for a certain amount of time the game would just stop working.

493
00:32:15,471 --> 00:32:15,870
Rym: All right.

494
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:23,110
Scott: For example in a dungeon II game like this Sometimes you'd guess like caught and amazed that what there was no escape from yeah, or like doors just stop working.

495
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,502
Rym: You can't open doors anymore.

496
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:36,066
Rym: Now the game's broken Yeah, and basically the company would wait for people to open queries and be like Hey the game crashed and I got this error and then the company could say yeah Cuz you fucking pirated our game you piece of shit.

497
00:32:36,127 --> 00:32:36,530
Rym: That's right.

498
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:39,517
Rym: so You can watch the video.

499
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:43,350
Scott: I think is a lot of people pirated not even realizing piracy was a thing, right?

500
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,332
Rym: Yeah, but then they'd learn People.

501
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:51,730
Rym: but I'll link to the actual like detailed technical technical documentation do because this shit is fascinating.

502
00:32:53,111 --> 00:32:58,010
Rym: What the way this copy protection worked is that the discs the floppy discs that they?

503
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,112
Rym: Manufactured.

504
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:05,695
Rym: some of the bits were fuzzy and they would return a one or a zero Randomly mm-hmm.

505
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:13,350
Rym: There was no way to copy that Mm-hmm, and the game would periodically check to see what's the value of this one bit?

506
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:18,753
Rym: And if it doesn't ever change then they know it's a pirated copy of the game Uh-huh.

507
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:21,750
Scott: What if you just get unlucky and the fuzziness stays static for a little bit?

508
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:23,615
Rym: It checks over time.

509
00:33:23,655 --> 00:33:24,458
Rym: It was a slow burn.

510
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:27,910
Rym: Okay, and the video and the article go into a lot of detail.

511
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:29,877
Rym: It's uh, it's fascinating.

512
00:33:29,897 --> 00:33:32,084
Rym: never had a false positive not that I could see.

513
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:33,549
Scott: Okay, so what do you got?

514
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:34,435
Scott: What do I have?

515
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:36,850
Scott: I forget you have all right like Urges Cup.

516
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:40,749
Scott: So this guy is some kind of historian or archaeologist or some kind of genius, dude.

517
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:48,340
Scott: And he's given his lecture and it's a real disappointing thing of the day because this is a clearly a long ass lecture And the video is only three minutes.

518
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:50,030
Scott: I don't know where to hell to get the rest of the lecture.

519
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:52,410
Scott: Please y'all find it and send it to me urgently.

520
00:33:53,852 --> 00:33:57,636
Scott: Sorry for the disappointing thing of the day But what he talks about they used to be news.

521
00:33:57,676 --> 00:34:02,370
Scott: lecture is like Urges Cup, which is some cup from Sparta or something.

522
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:09,710
Scott: But the cup has some sort of amazing property where like in the when you it's like it changes color.

523
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:12,181
Scott: It's like in the different light or heat condition.

524
00:34:12,203 --> 00:34:21,330
Scott: It's like it's like holy shit And for a long time people basically didn't believe that like this was like all the ancient people didn't have technology for that.

525
00:34:21,552 --> 00:34:22,889
Scott: You know, no, no way.

526
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:31,830
Scott: But no as it turns out they totally did and we lost that technology for like centuries Before we figured out how they did it and then we're able to do it ourselves.

527
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:34,168
Scott: It's pretty crazy.

528
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:37,819
Scott: So yeah, check this out and I'm I want to check out.

529
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:39,223
Scott: What's the guy's name?

530
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,085
Scott: Does it say his name there?

531
00:34:40,106 --> 00:34:43,013
Rym: Ah Couldn't be.

532
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:44,679
Scott: no, isn't that his name right there?

533
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,542
Scott: and samobergia?

534
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:46,445
Rym: I guess it's his channel.

535
00:34:46,565 --> 00:34:46,867
Scott: Yeah.

536
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:47,087
Rym: Yep.

537
00:34:47,188 --> 00:34:47,830
Rym: It's samobergia.

538
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:56,712
Rym: Yeah So this whatever he is samobergia this sociologist and the founder of Bismarck analysis a firm that analyzes institutions and something something Whatever.

539
00:34:56,732 --> 00:35:01,910
Scott: this dude is like the most amazing like he could replace every history professor on earth.

540
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:05,880
Scott: It's like in three less than the three minutes.

541
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,370
Scott: He already captivated me with his lecture.

542
00:35:08,892 --> 00:35:13,750
Scott: I just want to go and subscribe to his podcast and YouTube channel, which I already did subscribe to that.

543
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:20,610
Rym: So so in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book pages of pain and full pages by Troy Denny.

544
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:22,489
Scott: I have endured all the pain of the pages.

545
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:32,030
Rym: Yeah No, I was able to fully express the extent of this novel with simply four images from King of the Hill And we're gonna do a show on it next Thursday.

546
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:33,133
Rym: Stay tuned.

547
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:35,181
Rym: We're gonna talk about this book.

548
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:44,557
Rym: We're gonna assume you read it and I think it might be the best written Officially licensed Dungeons & Dragons novel.

549
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:49,630
Scott: I mean so they say throng is the best written officially licensed Star Wars novels.

550
00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:51,602
Rym: I feel like this is the best one.

551
00:35:51,622 --> 00:35:55,869
Scott: It doesn't mean it's a good No, it's the least smelly poop.

552
00:35:56,632 --> 00:36:02,089
Rym: All I'm saying is that this one feels like it did something different compared to every other garbage D&D.

553
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:03,053
Scott: That is true.

554
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,350
Scott: The other ones are probably all just like yeah, we beat the evil was there.

555
00:36:07,571 --> 00:36:20,688
Rym: I'm an elf and I'm doing elf stuff and plot happens and look there's Elminster and Kelvin Blackstaff Driss Dorden Meanwhile, this one's like this guy's on an adventure and then two minutes later.

556
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:26,385
Rym: It's like well I swapped a foot for a hand and I'm turning to goop and we're in trouble here.

557
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:28,170
Scott: He turned to goop game first.

558
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:29,554
Rym: Yeah, that came first.

559
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:31,139
Scott: that led to anyway.

560
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:37,457
Rym: then the amount of times limbs get swapped in this book is Several more than you would expect.

561
00:36:37,517 --> 00:36:44,646
Rym: Yeah, like you think oh that was a thing and then it happens again And you think oh, I guess that happened twice that and then it keeps happening.

562
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:45,370
Rym: You're just like what?

563
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:49,139
Rym: So, yeah, we're gonna talk about that book.

564
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:51,509
Rym: Otherwise, we have no convention still PAX West.

565
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:55,344
Scott: It's on Labor Day weekend in Seattle.

566
00:36:55,384 --> 00:36:56,650
Scott: tickets already went on sale.

567
00:36:57,851 --> 00:37:00,200
Scott: I booked flights to there got hotels.

568
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:02,650
Scott: There are some tickets left on sale.

569
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,902
Rym: Well, there are tickets for every day, but Saturday on sale.

570
00:37:05,922 --> 00:37:06,584
Scott: You checked us now.

571
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:08,090
Rym: No, I checked a while ago.

572
00:37:08,271 --> 00:37:10,601
Rym: Okay, maybe there's fewer days now.

573
00:37:10,621 --> 00:37:11,444
Scott: It's West up.

574
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:11,665
Scott: Yeah.

575
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:13,574
Rym: Oh Friday, oh, yeah.

576
00:37:13,594 --> 00:37:14,197
Rym: No, we're good.

577
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,564
Rym: Sunday is almost so loud.

578
00:37:15,786 --> 00:37:18,236
Scott: Okay, but Friday Friday or Monday?

579
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:19,120
Scott: No problem.

580
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,766
Scott: Friday is actually a really good deal.

581
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:23,309
Scott: unlike Monday It's a full day of packs.

582
00:37:23,852 --> 00:37:30,312
Scott: Monday is a shortened day of packs and you get the keynote you get to you and a note on Friday and Q&A Monday.

583
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:33,343
Scott: you also get an omega-thon finale even though packs is shorter.

584
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,130
Rym: so you don't get like a concert or anything.

585
00:37:35,411 --> 00:37:37,845
Scott: No, but I don't think you get a concert on Friday either.

586
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:43,420
Rym: Yeah, also If you were trying to submit panels to packs they are online now.

587
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:47,390
Rym: the panel submission site was actually down for a while.

588
00:37:47,651 --> 00:37:48,255
Scott: It is up again.

589
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:49,784
Rym: It was just like giving an error.

590
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:51,615
Rym: It was weird, but they fixed it Whatever the problem was.

591
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:56,785
Rym: so go out submit your panels to packs And I think we should get right into it.

592
00:37:57,652 --> 00:38:00,489
Rym: So this problem is only getting worse and we got to do something about it.

593
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:06,568
Scott: Well, this all started really back in the day with the Microsoft and I trust you right and that suit was all about.

594
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:09,957
Scott: hey Microsoft you have a monopoly on computer operating systems.

595
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:22,949
Scott: Windows is dominated and you are including Internet Explorer with Windows right and you are using your monopoly power of operating systems to Stranglehold the market out of web browsers.

596
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:27,247
Scott: These are the days when you can still go to the store and like buy Netscape Navigator on disc or something.

597
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:31,938
Scott: Yep, right And you know that is against antitrust law.

598
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:36,614
Scott: and the Justice Department went after Microsoft and there's all kinds of business going on There.

599
00:38:36,877 --> 00:38:47,203
Scott: but since then even though tech companies and even worse telcos like NBC Comcast universal whatever the fuck it is now how many companies are in there?

600
00:38:47,223 --> 00:38:50,790
Scott: and Disney buy everything in the universe Disney own all of media entertainment.

601
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:54,843
Rym: I mean just say the words AOL Time Warner just rolls off the tongue.

602
00:38:54,903 --> 00:38:57,130
Scott: right all these mega mergers going on.

603
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:04,304
Scott: But the tech companies, you know, Google Amazon Facebook To some extent Netflix.

604
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:07,970
Rym: Yeah Netflix is plenty of competition.

605
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:08,914
Scott: Yeah, kind of.

606
00:39:08,934 --> 00:39:26,179
Scott: but anyway, the point is these mega mega companies Right are controlling huge aspects of society Right in a very few entities much like it's really not too different from the old train companies and oil companies well started in antitrust law in the first thing.

607
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:49,530
Rym: that's very different though in that a lot of the traditional trust busting was around a company that controls a sector absolutely either vertically or horizontally if any you're looking at it as Opposed to here where we have this mega corpse that do a large number of completely unrelated things And they wield power by the fact that they control these vastly disparate areas.

608
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:56,730
Rym: I mean the same company I just bought some new deodorant from online also hosts a bunch of my web infrastructure.

609
00:39:57,571 --> 00:40:01,469
Rym: Well, like that's weird and we've normalized it.

610
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:03,578
Scott: Yeah, you know you have it.

611
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:16,770
Scott: It's and it's like the Microsoft situation was like hey You that's the reason I brought it up is because it's like hey you own this monopoly on Operating systems and you're using it to weasel your way into web browsers, which we don't think of as being too far away.

612
00:40:17,074 --> 00:40:38,592
Scott: They're both computer software right but it's like you have a monopoly on book selling and you're using it to weasel your way into a monopoly on grocery selling and clothing selling and selling everything and also hosting everything and also shipping and receiving a Logistics and

613
00:40:38,993 --> 00:40:44,808
Rym: like I guess these companies are becoming the literal mega corpse from all cyberpunk dystopia book

614
00:40:44,888 --> 00:40:45,390
Scott: readers.

615
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:59,090
Rym: It's like and on one hand What's really interesting is that one of the measures of antitrust stuff back in the day was not just that they're monopoly But that they are abusing their status as monopoly and harming like the consumers.

616
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:08,030
Rym: but Actually like Amazon is an example, they've mostly been helping consumers and they've been harming the rest of society.

617
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:09,096
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing.

618
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:09,358
Scott: It's like.

619
00:41:09,418 --> 00:41:10,847
Scott: it's like, you know, it's like like.

620
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:14,184
Rym: as a person I don't want to have to go to any store but Amazon.

621
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,350
Rym: I just want to go to Amazon.

622
00:41:15,813 --> 00:41:18,630
Rym: I don't want to have to look at ten different sites to buy things, right?

623
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:26,829
Scott: It's like, you know, I can go without uber, you know, because I hate the uber just as I hate the Amazon I can't really go without the Amazon even though I'd like to.

624
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:30,466
Scott: But I can go without the uber because I you know, I know it's even worse.

625
00:41:30,547 --> 00:41:37,610
Scott: I put it's like If you go with the uber, it's like yeah, it's real cheap to get around way cheaper than the other.

626
00:41:38,293 --> 00:41:38,594
Scott: It's like.

627
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:40,482
Scott: it's really good for the user.

628
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:42,370
Scott: It's really good for the company.

629
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:48,910
Scott: It's really bad for an uber's case the driver and Amazon's place all the third-party sellers and everyone else in the whole society.

630
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,605
Rym: Yep, but look at even something simple like video games.

631
00:41:51,907 --> 00:41:55,846
Rym: on one hand We want there to be multiple storefronts for games known as a monopoly.

632
00:41:56,167 --> 00:42:08,450
Rym: on the other hand There are some multiple storefronts, but I still only buy games on Steam and if I can't buy it on Steam I think about it and decide if I even bother buying it because I don't want to have to deal with multiple stores.

633
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:17,301
Scott: Well, this is a thing that's you know, when if you're looking at just companies, it's like yeah We don't want to have you know, few large companies and have lots of small companies.

634
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:17,943
Scott: That's just better.

635
00:42:18,465 --> 00:42:31,156
Scott: but it with technology just the nature of computers there is benefit to Conglomeration aggregation Unification right all these things.

636
00:42:31,497 --> 00:42:33,503
Scott: there are real benefits to those things, right?

637
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:34,446
Scott: It's like Google.

638
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:38,481
Scott: Google makes Gmail They also may Google Docs.

639
00:42:39,043 --> 00:42:40,590
Scott: They also make your Android phone.

640
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:40,990
Scott: Yeah.

641
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:54,300
Scott: So if Google makes all those three things and then they integrates them all really nicely That provides the fact that they're all provided by the same person made by the same person company Whatever provides a benefit to the end user.

642
00:42:54,481 --> 00:43:00,161
Scott: if you had to get like Choose a phone from like five different phone operating systems.

643
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,070
Scott: And even if all of them were good, it's like, well, okay.

644
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,870
Scott: Well now you got to choose your email provider.

645
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:08,210
Scott: So I got to choose what I want to choose the one that works best on my phone.

646
00:43:08,735 --> 00:43:09,988
Scott: It's like there's 20 of them.

647
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,977
Scott: You know 20 things just like Gmail.

648
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:20,530
Scott: and then there's 30 different web browsers And then you're a developer trying to make a web page and that people are using 30 different web browsers.

649
00:43:21,192 --> 00:43:24,441
Scott: It's like it becomes from a technological standpoint.

650
00:43:24,782 --> 00:43:27,770
Scott: Just like this sort of hellscape of too many choices.

651
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:30,000
Scott: This is why Linux on the desktop couldn't grab on.

652
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:30,905
Scott: there's too many distros.

653
00:43:31,106 --> 00:43:31,970
Rym: Yep, right?

654
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,313
Scott: It's why Android is.

655
00:43:33,474 --> 00:43:35,701
Scott: is you know has people not updating?

656
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:37,908
Scott: is too many Android versions going around right?

657
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:38,410
Scott: with iOS?

658
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:40,522
Scott: It's just like yeah, everyone updates and has the newest one.

659
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:41,990
Scott: There's one version mostly.

660
00:43:42,772 --> 00:43:45,060
Rym: So what exactly do we do about this?

661
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,203
Rym: Do we just break them up?

662
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:47,046
Rym: And if so, how?

663
00:43:47,106 --> 00:43:47,267
Rym: like?

664
00:43:47,327 --> 00:44:03,553
Rym: this is a Really thorny issue for a lot of reasons because on one hand these monopolies or these pseudo monopolies wield undue power but on the other hand many of them have wielded that power for neutral or slightly positive Outcomes on occasion.

665
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:09,490
Scott: Yeah, right just cuz you know a bad evil serial killer saves one baby and then kills ten people.

666
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:13,405
Rym: What if he saves ten people and kills one person to do that?

667
00:44:13,505 --> 00:44:14,629
Scott: I'm just saying where's the line?

668
00:44:15,871 --> 00:44:20,910
Scott: Which trolley should not be a not a saint just because you did some good stuff is my point?

669
00:44:21,053 --> 00:44:21,568
Scott: Yeah, right.

670
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:30,070
Scott: but so one thing I think we can do is Basically, everything comes down to the government has to do something about it because no nothing else is gonna do it.

671
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:36,168
Scott: Yes, because because the right look at like the you know, stupid Zuckerberg owns most of Facebook So no one can tell them what to do.

672
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:37,316
Scott: but like what?

673
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:45,531
Scott: what it was like some ridiculous percent of the Investors not a percent of the shares because obviously then something would have happened if it was yeah more than 50% of the shares Voted.

674
00:44:45,832 --> 00:44:56,550
Scott: but like some ridiculous percentage of the investors who didn't own a majority of the shares Voted to kick Zuckerberg's ass out on the street, you know and stop doing evil privacy violating garbage.

675
00:44:56,731 --> 00:44:57,960
Scott: But they didn't have enough shares.

676
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,108
Scott: So nothing happened, right?

677
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:05,450
Scott: But yeah, so the in the absence of shareholders being able to do anything the government has to do something.

678
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,576
Scott: What should the government do?

679
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:14,094
Scott: Well, the easy things I think they should do is Enforce some sort of interoperability Situations, right?

680
00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:23,630
Scott: So if you look back in the day Microsoft had like a monopoly unlike, you know office But now there's like other things can read and write doc files.

681
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:25,094
Scott: So it's like yeah you.

682
00:45:25,114 --> 00:45:28,042
Rym: so how about like for gaming you can use your game.

683
00:45:28,062 --> 00:45:32,281
Rym: the launchers should have some sort of cross-launch interoperability.

684
00:45:32,322 --> 00:45:36,647
Scott: if they're about With OS X you can use the I work pages app.

685
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:39,157
Scott: or you know You can open up PowerPoints in what?

686
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:39,679
Scott: what do they call it?

687
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:41,627
Scott: keynote right keynote and PowerPoint.

688
00:45:41,767 --> 00:45:44,390
Scott: pretty good interoperability wise right.

689
00:45:44,631 --> 00:45:58,943
Scott: It's like by you know, and it's like once you know the inner that wasn't done by the government That was just Matt OS X working with Apple working really hard to get PowerPoints to load nicely in keynote And then once they do people can start using keynote.

690
00:45:59,264 --> 00:46:03,927
Scott: and now you know The Microsoft PowerPoint needs to sort of make you know not break.

691
00:46:03,987 --> 00:46:04,490
Scott: that right.

692
00:46:04,651 --> 00:46:09,790
Rym: We need something more complex and subtle with the caveat that I think there's a danger here as well.

693
00:46:10,092 --> 00:46:16,410
Rym: But I think we more need to break them up based on One company should not be in too many sectors, right?

694
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:23,990
Scott: Yes, I think that's the next thing right, but I think the Amazon storefront should not be the same company as Amazon web services.

695
00:46:24,171 --> 00:46:25,843
Scott: Yep, that one company.

696
00:46:25,923 --> 00:46:26,850
Scott: I think there's just be a lot.

697
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:32,590
Scott: I don't know how to word the law because I'm not a lawyer Right, but clearly it's a concept that people conceive of in their brain.

698
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:35,050
Scott: Therefore it should be possible to make a law out of it.

699
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:42,245
Scott: Here's the complication though is that you should be able to make a law that says One company must do one and only one thing you cannot even have.

700
00:46:42,345 --> 00:46:43,850
Scott: I think it should and I'm okay.

701
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:50,030
Scott: Even you would bring up that the like example of like, ah, you have the the subway and Carvel and the same little building.

702
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:51,456
Scott: I think you shouldn't even allow that.

703
00:46:51,576 --> 00:46:51,978
Scott: fuck that.

704
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:57,239
Scott: Yeah get for your subway and your Carvel next to each other But not the same company got a register them separately.

705
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,564
Scott: They go out of business separately.

706
00:46:58,584 --> 00:47:00,150
Scott: You can sell them separately, right?

707
00:47:00,411 --> 00:47:02,878
Scott: I'm okay with even being picky about that.

708
00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:06,690
Scott: if it means we can get a law that says one company does one fucking thing.

709
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,169
Rym: Yeah, I feel like it'd be a little broader than that.

710
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:12,521
Scott: I think everyone's ever to your cracker barrel with your restaurant your gift shop.

711
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:13,083
Scott: No.

712
00:47:13,424 --> 00:47:15,130
Rym: Yeah, I think that's a gift shop and restaurant.

713
00:47:15,351 --> 00:47:15,613
Rym: I'm not.

714
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:16,680
Rym: I'm not looking that drastic.

715
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:40,261
Rym: The thing I worry about more is that one of the benefits of these structures of it being in multiple sectors is that a company can Whether a downturn in sector a with the profits from sector B and continue doing research and development in things that aren't directly profitable because Due to fiduciary duty and the fact that these companies are beholden to the shareholders.

716
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:43,150
Rym: They're not allowed to like lose money.

717
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:49,910
Rym: They're not allowed to do sometimes strategic long-term thinking things but by having money from multiple sectors.

718
00:47:50,313 --> 00:47:52,048
Rym: There's a lot more flexibility there.

719
00:47:52,611 --> 00:47:59,823
Rym: That is we don't have a solution for that unless we also change the nature of the relationship between Shareholders and company.

720
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:00,530
Scott: that's what I'm saying.

721
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:07,615
Scott: If you have one company can only do one thing right if Netflix wants to start doing I don't know groceries groceries.

722
00:48:07,957 --> 00:48:17,336
Scott: if they're forced to make an actual Completely separate company with a separate board and separate everything and the grocery business doesn't do well Then that has to go out of business.

723
00:48:17,376 --> 00:48:19,564
Scott: They can't prop it up with their Netflix money.

724
00:48:19,584 --> 00:48:22,556
Rym: Mmm, right, you know That's a big part of the problem.

725
00:48:22,577 --> 00:48:23,280
Rym: Like look at uber.

726
00:48:23,743 --> 00:48:30,966
Rym: uber crack is just Subsidizing these drivers with to keep the prices low with their venture capital money.

727
00:48:30,986 --> 00:48:31,829
Rym: They're not profitable.

728
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:33,273
Rym: Nope They never will be.

729
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:37,467
Rym: probably nope, and frankly the only thing uber Alec.

730
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:38,330
Scott: I don't even care that.

731
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,930
Scott: Well, that's the thing is because when people do startups, they're not trying to be profitable.

732
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:46,790
Scott: They're just trying to make a product that gets enough users that someone else will buy them.

733
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:52,766
Scott: Mostly the people buying them are those big tech companies the Google Microsoft Apple right.

734
00:48:52,826 --> 00:49:02,250
Rym: Apple buys companies like Constantly, right and there's just a big like mold like 13 billion dollar merger of some like integration companies a while ago.

735
00:49:02,431 --> 00:49:08,259
Scott: But I'm saying is if you had antitrust it would be like, you know Every single one of those purchases of companies.

736
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,126
Scott: you'd be like no your giant Apple.

737
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:10,970
Scott: You can't buy that.

738
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:13,481
Scott: It's like don't allow this buying to happen.

739
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:14,446
Scott: Don't allow the merging.

740
00:49:14,506 --> 00:49:15,350
Scott: It's like you're enormous.

741
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:18,098
Scott: No, you cannot take over another fucking thing.

742
00:49:18,499 --> 00:49:20,565
Scott: No, you can't buy that Maps company Google.

743
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:22,050
Scott: It's competing with your Google Maps.

744
00:49:22,778 --> 00:49:23,629
Scott: That's not allowed.

745
00:49:23,979 --> 00:49:24,349
Scott: Stop it.

746
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:30,342
Scott: and then what would happen is a. There would some companies that are profitable would stick around and compete.

747
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:33,110
Scott: and all these tiny startups, right?

748
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:43,690
Scott: They wouldn't be able to have this business plan of burn virtual venture capital money make an unprofitable business Just trying to get users so that someone will buy you because the government won't allow anyone to buy you.

749
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:47,082
Scott: You're gonna have to make a you either make a profitable company or you make no company.

750
00:49:47,524 --> 00:49:55,630
Scott: and if all those companies basically suddenly Have to actually be profitable They probably won't even exist in the first place because you won't get those venture capital beyond investing in them.

751
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,596
Rym: I think these sectors can be pretty broad.

752
00:49:57,677 --> 00:50:03,804
Rym: Like I feel like Amazon's web services should be split from Amazon's selling business.

753
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:09,363
Rym: Yes I'm not that clear on whether or not Amazon's movies and video like.

754
00:50:09,403 --> 00:50:14,758
Rym: I feel like that does fit within the purview of IMA storefronts, you know, it's really.

755
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:24,550
Rym: I feel like this is like where's the line should Amazon be allowed to have its own Primary production studio to make movies and TV shows to sell on their storefront platform?

756
00:50:24,993 --> 00:50:33,030
Scott: I mean there are some blurry lines like that But like that one you could debate them into your but web services and storefronts a little earlier.

757
00:50:33,191 --> 00:50:35,130
Rym: Like there is a pretty clear line there.

758
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:40,187
Scott: But I have no problem just erring on the side of split it even if you're not sure.

759
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:42,355
Scott: split it Right, because it's like.

760
00:50:42,396 --> 00:50:43,480
Scott: what's the harm in splitting it?

761
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:50,890
Scott: if there's this harm in letting it stay together Right, if you let things stay together and you're not sure it's like someone could be nefarious.

762
00:50:51,232 --> 00:50:55,250
Scott: But if you split it and you weren't sure what's the worst case one of the halves goes out of business?

763
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,318
Scott: All right, no harm done.

764
00:50:56,581 --> 00:50:57,188
Scott: Sounds good to me.

765
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,238
Rym: Where do we split Apple up?

766
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,082
Rym: Like what are the?

767
00:51:01,102 --> 00:51:02,850
Rym: what are the companies that come out of an apples play?

768
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,495
Rym: Cuz I don't think apples monopoly.

769
00:51:04,515 --> 00:51:08,145
Rym: I don't think apples even like I'm not like there's not.

770
00:51:08,185 --> 00:51:09,710
Rym: there's no good line to split them up.

771
00:51:10,554 --> 00:51:11,821
Rym: This player right.

772
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:16,959
Rym: so Apple isn't necessarily a Monopoly, they're a powerful and wealthy company.

773
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:19,730
Scott: that well, they're the number they're the most biggest company on earth.

774
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:21,725
Rym: Well, that's why it's not necessarily antitrust.

775
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:25,469
Rym: There's a Apple's problem is that they have too much cash.

776
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:27,735
Scott: Well, that's that's a separate issue, right?

777
00:51:27,775 --> 00:51:39,158
Scott: But so personal with Apple right you have this situation where there are Certain parts of the business Right, they don't directly make money.

778
00:51:39,278 --> 00:51:40,201
Scott: OS X is free.

779
00:51:40,823 --> 00:51:44,633
Scott: basically, yep, right so it's like you're getting out Story.

780
00:51:44,694 --> 00:51:47,832
Scott: if you simply if you split them off software and hardware It's like.

781
00:51:47,852 --> 00:51:51,745
Scott: well if there's like a company that only made Apple Hardware, it's like.

782
00:51:51,765 --> 00:51:54,754
Scott: well they would Window, you know, they would.

783
00:51:54,874 --> 00:51:56,701
Scott: I guess I try I have to get.

784
00:51:56,882 --> 00:52:01,300
Scott: they would work hard to make sure Windows right on that hard Cuz there else no one would buy it.

785
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:01,663
Rym: Well, like.

786
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:02,810
Rym: here's another example Microsoft.

787
00:52:03,512 --> 00:52:14,330
Rym: I'm actually glad Microsoft is making like their own surface computers because I don't trust Third-parties to not put malware and garbage on Windows computers.

788
00:52:15,601 --> 00:52:19,411
Scott: Microsoft could which you know would probably be the opposite of antitrust.

789
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:44,487
Scott: those back to my point about you know, the benefit of technology specifically of Unification and fewer players is you know and having strong people right and monopolists is because Microsoft could you know having a OS monopoly could say you want to pre-install Windows on your PC Dell HP Sony whoever then you Lenovo then you are not allowed to install anything else.

790
00:52:44,507 --> 00:52:45,690
Scott: You must install pure windows.

791
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:46,988
Scott: I don't know why they've never done this.

792
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:51,250
Scott: Just don't allow these third parties to install garbage pre-installed bet.

793
00:52:51,611 --> 00:52:57,110
Rym: The reason they haven't done it is because there are a lot of people who would go after them for antitrust if they did that.

794
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:02,148
Scott: Yeah, but but antitrust has not been enforced basically since you know 20 years.

795
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:04,538
Scott: It's in a completely ignored law.

796
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,225
Scott: So why wouldn't you push it?

797
00:53:06,747 --> 00:53:08,875
Scott: It's not so much Or the last.

798
00:53:09,015 --> 00:53:13,790
Rym: it's that like American antitrust law is complex enough to where?

799
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:17,521
Rym: Everyone's kind of following the rules because it mostly focused on now.

800
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:18,845
Rym: I'm just paraphrasing a lawyer.

801
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:20,270
Rym: I was talking to a while ago.

802
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:24,109
Rym: I'm not a lawyer and I'm not an expert on this and I'm trying to skim this Wikipedia article.

803
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:28,790
Scott: It is too complicated a thing of like when it's like it's one of those things where it's like they.

804
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:34,810
Scott: I'm not technically a monopoly, you know that company has an army of lawyers and they're not technically a not monopoly.

805
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:38,520
Scott: but there's still a company that is too large and too powerful.

806
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:49,964
Scott: that is perhaps more powerful in the government in some ways and If they are not technically a monopoly by the current antitrust law Then the antitrust law should be updated so that they are but basically it covers.

807
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,510
Rym: are they doing harm?

808
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,089
Rym: Are they restricting the market?

809
00:53:53,491 --> 00:54:06,370
Rym: Like there's all these things that make you qualify for these antitrust rules and none of these big tech companies are doing any of these Things and in fact some of the things that are disallowed from doing would probably be to the net benefit of society.

810
00:54:07,312 --> 00:54:09,162
Rym: So it gets really complex.

811
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:16,830
Rym: It's not really antitrust It's a new thing because fundamentally the real problem is just that no single entity should have that much power, right?

812
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,444
Rym: It's like septic government.

813
00:54:18,504 --> 00:54:26,922
Scott: way back We talked about too big to fail with like the banks which should also be broken up probably Yeah, much smaller banks and they talk about too big to fail, right?

814
00:54:27,002 --> 00:54:29,510
Scott: It's like oh no if these fail then our society has failed.

815
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,444
Scott: Well, it's like then that too big to fail is too big to exist.

816
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:34,663
Rym: Well, no too big to fail It doesn't matter.

817
00:54:34,764 --> 00:54:35,170
Rym: I got a better.

818
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,959
Scott: This is or how many rules you're following.

819
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,784
Scott: if you know company should be allowed to be that big Period even if you're only doing one thing, you're just a bank Scott.

820
00:54:45,804 --> 00:54:46,447
Rym: Here's the bank.

821
00:54:46,508 --> 00:54:47,010
Scott: It's too big.

822
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:49,037
Scott: Sorry, now you're two banks too big.

823
00:54:49,057 --> 00:54:51,606
Rym: to fail doesn't necessarily mean now you're smaller.

824
00:54:51,887 --> 00:54:58,490
Rym: too big to fail means That's something the government should be doing for the benefit of society as opposed to a private company doing it for profit.

825
00:54:58,711 --> 00:55:00,317
Scott: Right, and that goes back to right.

826
00:55:00,477 --> 00:55:03,990
Rym: Yeah, I talked about, you know, having you know, tell I'm kind of getting sick of capitalism.

827
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:08,450
Scott: It's a type of interoperability as the one as one of the possible solutions.

828
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:13,850
Scott: Right force the tech companies like force Apple to let anyone make you know apps without having the app.

829
00:55:15,213 --> 00:55:26,269
Scott: Another thing we could do is for the government to take some of the technological things Right that these companies do and turn them into utilities.

830
00:55:26,772 --> 00:55:35,285
Rym: You know what my guy that's exactly what I was gonna suggest cuz my example I was instead of Facebook being some company like private ass companies like no as a social network.

831
00:55:35,325 --> 00:55:36,829
Scott: That's the utility the end.

832
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:43,913
Scott: Well, you know anyone can make a social network app that connects to the government photo stream Whatever.

833
00:55:43,933 --> 00:55:47,710
Rym: now, maybe you can make your own but they can't get above a certain And it might not even you know.

834
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:51,108
Scott: And people are worried about government censorship and government spying and those things.

835
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:58,270
Scott: and you're right The government doesn't have to actually run the utility just like that's to enforce an interoperability, right?

836
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,430
Scott: It's like the government doesn't run the phone network or the power grid.

837
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:05,969
Scott: I think they should they should but you know, they could just be like.

838
00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:09,219
Scott: hey Here are the rules for power grid Facebook.

839
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:15,490
Scott: You are now no different than like, you know, Con Edison, basically Here's a better example cuz social networks get tricky in a hurry.

840
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:21,391
Rym: But the example I was going to use I was leading you to this was say we had to break up Apple or die Apple.

841
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:21,753
Rym: Google.

842
00:56:22,235 --> 00:56:27,981
Rym: Google does a lot of really critical things for modern society Like for example, so changing the main thing Google Maps.

843
00:56:28,081 --> 00:56:30,029
Rym: Google Maps could not make money.

844
00:56:30,913 --> 00:56:34,450
Rym: Google Maps cannot make money except by advertising and nonsense.

845
00:56:34,912 --> 00:56:37,340
Rym: Yeah, Google Maps by itself could not succeed.

846
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,869
Scott: Google Maps became a guy like maps gov.

847
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:45,600
Rym: But you want to know the only thing worse than Google Maps Have restaurant reviews and ads on it.

848
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:47,550
Scott: It would just be great maps with great directions.

849
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:51,427
Rym: Do you remember what it was like back when you had to go to MapQuest or nothing?

850
00:56:51,668 --> 00:56:52,230
Scott: Yeah, it sucks.

851
00:56:52,390 --> 00:57:00,174
Rym: Yeah, well, but yeah, Google Maps is the kind of thing that I think should be a service provided by the federal governments Mm-hmm, like that.

852
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:03,145
Scott: I think that should actually not even be something provided by the federal government.

853
00:57:03,185 --> 00:57:06,790
Scott: I think that should be like a Cooperation between all world governments.

854
00:57:07,973 --> 00:57:09,202
Rym: But that's not a world

855
00:57:09,323 --> 00:57:13,889
Scott: map service Right, of course the probably only problem there that you would get into

856
00:57:13,909 --> 00:57:17,582
Rym: well The only problem only you're the only is gonna be a real big problem

857
00:57:17,723 --> 00:57:23,121
Scott: would be that many of the borders drawn Perhaps around Kashmir or China on this world map.

858
00:57:23,503 --> 00:57:29,462
Rym: Yep, right there are disputes about what the world Some countries wouldn't want to display gay bars.

859
00:57:30,065 --> 00:57:31,389
Rym: Like there'd be shit like that would happen.

860
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,998
Rym: You can't global dig.

861
00:57:34,259 --> 00:57:36,086
Rym: let's stay away from making this global.

862
00:57:36,106 --> 00:57:37,149
Rym: just saying the one thing.

863
00:57:37,169 --> 00:57:40,030
Rym: I Right answer in principle in a yeah.

864
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:56,069
Rym: But the reality is and even in this era of the rise of fascism and the fucked up Trump world that were like this hellscape I still think that the only thing worse than the United States being the primary regulator of the internet is Literally any other country getting that power?

865
00:57:57,252 --> 00:58:00,168
Rym: That is that is why I'm kind of looking at a u.s.

866
00:58:00,228 --> 00:58:02,955
Rym: Focused Initiative here because if the u.s.

867
00:58:02,996 --> 00:58:07,790
Rym: Does something or the EU does something all the mega corps have to play ball.

868
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:09,817
Rym: They cannot leave those markets.

869
00:58:10,158 --> 00:58:10,580
Rym: Mmm.

870
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:16,501
Rym: You could I'd only yeah China There are Chinese there's a Chinese market that could rival that.

871
00:58:16,802 --> 00:58:18,648
Rym: there really aren't other markets that are big enough.

872
00:58:18,688 --> 00:58:21,601
Scott: I don't think Mmm, don't be big then be small.

873
00:58:22,244 --> 00:58:23,650
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, what do you want?

874
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:27,866
Rym: You want to have Google Maps that only works in the US and then go to Japan.

875
00:58:27,886 --> 00:58:30,376
Rym: you got to get the like Japanese government app.

876
00:58:30,396 --> 00:58:31,480
Rym: that sucks and is different.

877
00:58:32,062 --> 00:58:32,183
Scott: Mmm.

878
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:33,950
Rym: I don't think that's gonna work Google.

879
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:46,610
Rym: But I guess I want there to be an ecosystem where something like something as good as Google Maps can exist and is funded Not through consumers paying for it and not through advertising and not their data mining.

880
00:58:47,112 --> 00:58:48,276
Rym: The only other option.

881
00:58:48,296 --> 00:58:55,210
Rym: there is a government service or a government subsidized service Provided with rules and regulations by private companies.

882
00:58:56,271 --> 00:59:00,990
Scott: Or, you know, I mean the other thing is like, you know people don't really think out of the box, right?

883
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:03,561
Rym: It's like I think we're thinking out of the box.

884
00:59:03,661 --> 00:59:05,590
Rym: I just said the government should take over Google Maps.

885
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:07,879
Scott: No, he's right.

886
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:09,467
Scott: For example, right?

887
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:10,029
Rym: How about this?

888
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:18,430
Scott: The government goes and takes all the source code and all the you know Google Maps, right and then just like fucking hands it out.

889
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:21,989
Scott: So now anyone can run a Google Maps now now this Google Maps is all over the fucking place.

890
00:59:22,753 --> 00:59:23,980
Rym: I don't think that would work.

891
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:25,449
Rym: Which one do you which one are you using?

892
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,167
Scott: No, I'm just saying like just fucking.

893
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:33,058
Scott: you know It's like if suddenly these things that are the only thing that is keeping us The only thing that's keeping that data accurate.

894
00:59:33,118 --> 00:59:36,230
Rym: is Google having a massive engine that's going out and collecting.

895
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:37,434
Rym: I'm aware of that.

896
00:59:37,514 --> 00:59:42,670
Rym: but I'm saying is that the a static snapshot of Google Maps data is worthless within a week.

897
00:59:42,932 --> 00:59:45,090
Scott: I'm not saying you're thinking too, right?

898
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:49,730
Scott: I'm no reason that we can't force these things to be open, right?

899
00:59:50,011 --> 00:59:51,497
Rym: It's like only it could.

900
00:59:51,517 --> 00:59:54,590
Scott: just you know, right we could take OS X and be like, you know what Apple?

901
00:59:55,011 --> 01:00:02,475
Scott: Not only do you have to keep developing this but also why should they unless we're paying them to do it We just force them.

902
01:00:02,576 --> 01:00:02,937
Rym: What do you mean?

903
01:00:02,997 --> 01:00:03,439
Rym: force them?

904
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:04,343
Rym: What do you mean?

905
01:00:04,524 --> 01:00:05,850
Scott: can write any law?

906
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,374
Scott: The law can say almost anything.

907
01:00:08,394 --> 01:00:21,958
Scott: the government cannot write laws that force people into conscripted labor How well conscripted later if we require if it's just saying if you want your company To continue to engage in commerce.

908
01:00:22,379 --> 01:00:25,470
Scott: We are the Congress who has the unlimited ability to regulate commerce.

909
01:00:26,254 --> 01:00:29,629
Scott: Anyone who makes an operating system must open source it completely at all times.

910
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:31,014
Scott: How about that law?

911
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:35,610
Scott: anyone who makes a mapping system must make all their map data completely public at all times?

912
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:41,970
Scott: Anyone who makes a search engine must keep their entire search index and its algorithm and everything open source at all times.

913
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:42,954
Rym: So Scott you can't.

914
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:47,797
Scott: you want to make any sort of computer protocol or API must have it fully documented Available to public at all times.

915
01:00:47,837 --> 01:00:50,090
Rym: fuck you so you could make a law like that.

916
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,415
Rym: I can write literally anything.

917
01:00:51,455 --> 01:00:56,541
Rym: if I had a small company that made like mapping software and that law existed I would just shut the company down.

918
01:00:56,804 --> 01:00:57,066
Scott: Sure.

919
01:00:57,107 --> 01:00:59,117
Rym: Go ahead I think every company would shut down.

920
01:00:59,498 --> 01:01:04,370
Scott: if you have a bookstore if you have a store online You know where you allow, right?

921
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:07,623
Scott: You can just be like boom any kind of crazy thing you can come up with.

922
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:13,609
Scott: just force all these companies, you know if you See, well, how could we destroy Oz with a crazy law?

923
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:17,881
Rym: Hmm see the point is you gotta get creative but it's got.

924
01:01:17,921 --> 01:01:34,933
Scott: my point is the goal isn't just if you if you make If you make a hardware device of any kind You must provide all customers with the unlimited ability to have any replacement parts full schematics to repair it on their own full documentation of all software included right.

925
01:01:36,814 --> 01:01:44,930
Scott: full documentation on all protocols radio signals How to make so that people can make their own accessories with no limit whatsoever.

926
01:01:46,571 --> 01:01:54,967
Rym: What if I'm making highly specialized medical stuff for one particular realm and even more reason and provide full documentation to all patients doctors All right?

927
01:01:55,070 --> 01:02:08,682
Rym: so what is what if that's that tiny weird niche ecosystem is Already on such a thin margin that if you were required to do the extra work to open-source it and document it You'd might as well just go out of business instead.

928
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:09,849
Rym: and now there's nothing.

929
01:02:11,132 --> 01:02:12,057
Scott: I think that's a bunch of bullshit.

930
01:02:12,379 --> 01:02:13,465
Rym: I think things like that will happen.

931
01:02:13,485 --> 01:02:14,350
Scott: They're making plenty money.

932
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:19,527
Scott: Also, if you're talking about medical stuff met no medical business should be able to be for-profit.

933
01:02:19,588 --> 01:02:31,549
Rym: I agree with that right, so therefore just fucking do it, but I'm saying that Some of the ideas you came up with around say Google Maps would just cause companies to stop making maps full stop.

934
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:32,873
Scott: No deal with it.

935
01:02:33,234 --> 01:02:38,509
Rym: So I think a better solution is to either you don't have capitalism then there's an incentives.

936
01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:40,854
Rym: besides Middle ground would be.

937
01:02:40,914 --> 01:02:43,545
Rym: imagine if the government said there's gonna be a government map.

938
01:02:43,906 --> 01:02:47,138
Rym: We are going to Basically eminent domain Google Maps.

939
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,170
Rym: Google has to keep maintaining it, but the government will pay.

940
01:02:52,271 --> 01:02:54,809
Scott: That's the thing keeping your capitalism around with your paying.

941
01:02:55,931 --> 01:02:56,715
Rym: What is paying?

942
01:02:56,776 --> 01:02:59,690
Rym: who said capital paying is just effectively?

943
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:02,359
Rym: Providing the materials to make the thing.

944
01:03:02,499 --> 01:03:03,343
Scott: I don't think government money.

945
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:04,830
Scott: should we go to some private Google company?

946
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:06,195
Scott: I think we just take it.

947
01:03:06,898 --> 01:03:13,710
Rym: I feel like there is a balance between the two because If the government just takes it you had your chance to be not evil and then you got ready.

948
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:15,727
Scott: You don't be evil rule because you're evil we can fuck you.

949
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,880
Rym: The problem is you were good who wouldn't have to fuck?

950
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:35,229
Rym: you got to live in the reality of government Which means that the government well the way it's currently structured unless we've completely restructured the government Which I know we both have thoughts on that too Not really the topic of this show There is no way to hire the kinds of people you would need to continue to make that software good.

951
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:39,929
Scott: Another thing is you know just the government could use someone like me the government.

952
01:03:39,969 --> 01:03:45,710
Rym: in fact I make more money than I'm I would legally be allowed to make pretty much anywhere in the federal government.

953
01:03:46,111 --> 01:03:51,590
Rym: So unless you destroy the entire private sector people like me would never work for a government.

954
01:03:53,252 --> 01:03:57,330
Scott: You also you know the other evil things the big tech companies do like privacy invading.

955
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:58,193
Scott: I think they're like CEOs.

956
01:03:58,213 --> 01:04:00,843
Scott: you just go to jail for that Scott.

957
01:04:00,863 --> 01:04:02,530
Rym: That's actually if you read GDPR.

958
01:04:03,711 --> 01:04:06,179
Scott: Well that has the non enforced like what it are.

959
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:06,841
Rym: what do you mean?

960
01:04:06,881 --> 01:04:15,050
Scott: not enforced it's it is enforced fairly well No, so what I was reading about the GDPR in Europe is that Ireland is in charge of enforcing it.

961
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:21,490
Scott: Yeah, and they basically have taken no actions basically against any big tech companies because oh, they're all I keeping there.

962
01:04:21,651 --> 01:04:24,190
Scott: You know using Ireland as their tax haven is big scam.

963
01:04:24,311 --> 01:04:26,263
Rym: There's a little more to it than that and they're all.

964
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:32,549
Scott: there's a lot of G There's a lot of GDPR Violations going on in the big tech companies and no one's doing anything about it.

965
01:04:33,191 --> 01:04:34,817
Rym: Yeah, but for now since Ireland's

966
01:04:34,858 --> 01:04:35,600
Scott: job to do it all

967
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:54,024
Rym: I would say is stay tuned on that because there was sort of a again, I'm not a lawyer, but there's sort of an an agreement that there would be a slow ramp-up of enforcement because the actual fines and punishments described in the law are Terrifying in how extreme they are good like if they're based.

968
01:04:54,064 --> 01:04:55,510
Rym: They're actually pretty cool.

969
01:04:55,590 --> 01:05:00,645
Rym: They're based on the gross like revenue of the company that does the violation.

970
01:05:00,665 --> 01:05:00,966
Rym: That's right.

971
01:05:01,207 --> 01:05:02,150
Rym: So a little company.

972
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:05,742
Rym: It's iron monkey style if Google messes up they owe billions.

973
01:05:06,043 --> 01:05:14,632
Rym: where if GeekNights messes up We owe what I'd owe like 20% of our gross revenue, which would come down to like under a thousand dollars Right.

974
01:05:15,155 --> 01:05:17,165
Scott: I basically think you know, it's like the the.

975
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:25,250
Scott: if you're that big If you're that big and you have that much money you have no excuse not to fuck up, right?

976
01:05:25,511 --> 01:05:28,330
Scott: So if you do fuck up, you shouldn't even get like three strikes.

977
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:33,430
Rym: You should just be punished in a devastating manner, but I'm saying the way the approach to this.

978
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:44,850
Rym: I think what we need like the practical way to solve this problem is to have the United States Senate Back and once it's under the control of the Democratic Party again, when will that happen?

979
01:05:45,931 --> 01:05:48,628
Rym: You're alive either in 2020 or I'm probably leaving the country.

980
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:53,322
Rym: So but We need to actually pass a few laws.

981
01:05:53,342 --> 01:05:56,355
Scott: You know, the numbers are there for 2020.

982
01:05:56,355 --> 01:05:57,620
Rym: We only need to get to 50.

983
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,122
Rym: Uh-huh.

984
01:05:58,503 --> 01:06:02,019
Rym: That's literally all you need because if you get the presidency Then you also have the tie-breaking vote.

985
01:06:02,281 --> 01:06:02,422
Rym: Mm-hmm.

986
01:06:02,884 --> 01:06:15,089
Rym: It's pretty close there Mm-hmm But anyway We need to pass some basic laws to reign in the extreme power of a handful of existing tech companies And I feel like that is achievable in the next decade.

987
01:06:15,952 --> 01:06:23,490
Rym: Amazon Google Facebook There's a really short list of companies that need to be very broadly broken up into broad sector companies.

988
01:06:23,953 --> 01:06:30,097
Rym: Yeah, even that would buy us a lot another way to go and this is sort of like the crazy talk.

989
01:06:30,117 --> 01:06:45,930
Rym: alternative if we're looking out of the box is those companies should pick a side and use their billions to fix society and Solve the problems that are being caused by these monopolies such that the government leaves them alone because they actually funded the solution.

990
01:06:46,351 --> 01:06:49,963
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, that's the thing is like monopolies are tolerated if they serve the public.

991
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,184
Rym: good.

992
01:06:50,505 --> 01:06:51,930
Rym: look at the sports exemptions.

993
01:06:52,692 --> 01:06:55,823
Rym: All major league sports are exempted from all antitrust laws.

994
01:06:56,144 --> 01:06:57,930
Scott: Yeah, because having more than one sports league is stupid.

995
01:06:58,272 --> 01:07:01,990
Scott: Yes, so in some technology one search engine is sort of similarly stupid.

996
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:07,550
Rym: Yes, so in some technology areas, there are definitely spaces where it makes sense to have one company that is monopoly.

997
01:07:07,993 --> 01:07:16,170
Rym: But we need heavy rules and regulations regulating that industry and that company and We need the government to pass those laws.

998
01:07:16,873 --> 01:07:33,467
Rym: I feel like the big tech companies the best thing to do would be to lobby and Take over the government enough to force those changes so they can maintain their monopoly status But get appropriate regulations on top of themselves before we just bust them up because they we hit Mad Max post capitalism.

999
01:07:33,487 --> 01:07:38,753
Rym: Hmm anyway We're not lawyers or politicians It's still.

1000
01:07:38,813 --> 01:07:41,121
Scott: it's interesting how this was like.

1001
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:43,590
Scott: this kind of talk was like non exist.

1002
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:49,710
Rym: You know like non existent talk, why do you think we've officially endorsed Elizabeth Warren for the US presidency?

1003
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:50,391
Scott: It's like.

1004
01:07:50,551 --> 01:07:55,646
Scott: only among the craziest of nerds like us was this talk and now lately it's become like the.

1005
01:07:55,847 --> 01:07:58,175
Scott: the amount of this Talk is like increasing.

1006
01:07:58,236 --> 01:07:59,501
Scott: It's still not huge right?

1007
01:07:59,783 --> 01:08:03,950
Scott: You're still not seeing this like, you know All people talking about this all over the place, right?

1008
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:05,577
Scott: It's not like at the level of say.

1009
01:08:05,657 --> 01:08:08,510
Scott: also it's a level of like gun control where everyone talks about it.

1010
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:14,425
Rym: Still am very much against a lot of the things that the EU is trying to do to Microsoft.

1011
01:08:14,826 --> 01:08:15,769
Rym: I didn't think it was.

1012
01:08:16,952 --> 01:08:20,162
Scott: A lot of times they're doing stuff be just because they're trying to attack.

1013
01:08:20,383 --> 01:08:22,490
Rym: you can't bundle your web browser anymore.

1014
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,157
Rym: You don't see the right jackass.

1015
01:08:24,176 --> 01:08:27,350
Rym: How do I download Chrome if I don't have a web browser?

1016
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:29,154
Scott: We're in attacking European companies, right?

1017
01:08:29,194 --> 01:08:33,308
Scott: Yes, just you know, sort of, you know, a commercial war kind of situation.

1018
01:08:33,408 --> 01:08:35,596
Scott: Yep Economic warfare.

1019
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:39,156
Rym: It's a very complex situation but the fundamental problem remains.

1020
01:08:39,477 --> 01:08:53,649
Rym: there is a small number of companies that have terrifying amounts of money and terrifying amounts of power over the global infrastructure and Few and they are too big and therefore they must be destroyed or forced to not be too big.

1021
01:08:53,790 --> 01:09:04,642
Rym: Yeah, but the details of how we do that are very complex and probably involve drastically reorienting not just these companies But the US federal government as a whole our entire society.

1022
01:09:04,662 --> 01:09:04,742
