1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,782
Rym: It's Monday March 4th 2019.

2
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:12,065
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:14,591
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,972 --> 00:00:16,175
Rym: It's finally time.

5
00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:18,877
Rym: It is a tech news roundup.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,614
Scott: Let's do this as long time.

7
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:37,910
Rym: listeners of GeekNights will know we Periodically run out of good ideas for Monday shows because a lot of things we could talk about on a month Yeah, technically you mean frequently are not technically technology news.

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:47,101
Rym: They are mostly business news because most technology news is actually business news And none of you care when like Linux kernel 5.0.0.0.0.1.8 comes out.

9
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,398
Rym: so Every year around this time.

10
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:56,902
Rym: I start thinking to myself.

11
00:00:56,922 --> 00:01:02,259
Rym: Oh, we're really out of Monday shows and then I think to myself Hey, why did we do a tech news roundup?

12
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:04,666
Rym: and Scott always says nope we just did one.

13
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:05,790
Rym: That's a cop-out show.

14
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:06,615
Rym: That's a BS.

15
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,950
Rym: We're not doing it unless it's been a while.

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,355
Scott: Well, they used to be the dynamic.

17
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,467
Scott: the new dynamic is pretty much every Monday.

18
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:17,830
Scott: Rym is like Let's do tech news roundup and I say no you can wait until March.

19
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,933
Scott: Yep, and it.

20
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:21,441
Scott: so now Rym knows his March is smart.

21
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,808
Rym: just coming stupid smarts weather.

22
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:34,793
Scott: Yeah Hey, it is stupid smart your weather And he's like all right first Monday show March or do a tech news roundup in the next Monday He'll probably ask to do one again, and I'll be like no yeah I got some.

23
00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:37,469
Rym: I think I got some ideas for some Monday topics, but good luck.

24
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:46,756
Rym: We're doing a tech news roundup today, so in the opening bit We didn't do a show on Thursday, so we were gonna do 2001 a space Odyssey Which is the current GeekNights book club.

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:58,250
Rym: I didn't finish reading it in time because I was busy Uh-huh, but I ended up having to do a work thing that night anyway Uh-huh, so we couldn't do the show where you will be doing the GeekNights.

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,114
Rym: But book club.

27
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:03,851
Rym: on to lies your opening bit the meta moment a space Odyssey Cuz.

28
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:04,313
Rym: we're not.

29
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,699
Rym: we're just gonna go straight into the main bit.

30
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:06,923
Rym: It's a weird day.

31
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:08,570
Rym: It's tech news roundup day, okay.

32
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:15,270
Rym: Also, we're not live-streaming this one because I got water flooding in through one of my bathroom ceilings And I hear it splashing even more over there.

33
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:30,447
Rym: Yeah, I hear it escalating so I'm gonna pause recording the show to go look at that, and then we're gonna get ready for Things of the day, I just closed the door so I can't hear that water dripping anymore.

34
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:31,230
Scott: I still hear it dripping.

35
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:32,407
Rym: I hear it, but less so.

36
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:39,470
Scott: So what do you got thing of the day was so you know in Japan does that the mega earthquake way back?

37
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:54,934
Scott: When you're at PAX East that one time yeah, and it messed up most notably a lot of most a lot of Japan But it messed up Fukushima where there's nuclear power plant that was poorly maintained famously and basically everyone evacuated there and hasn't really gone back because You know

38
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:55,636
Rym: yep,

39
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:58,285
Scott: it's like Chernobyl not Chernobyl bad, but close.

40
00:02:58,406 --> 00:02:58,526
Scott: Yeah.

41
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,610
Rym: I hope this is not bad.

42
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:02,310
Rym: I hope this is not late breaking news to any of you.

43
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,890
Rym: You can read like a book or talk to an old person if you want like documentaries.

44
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:09,210
Scott: What is don't go there, but someone did go there stupidly?

45
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,152
Scott: And what?

46
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:16,670
Scott: I'm always glad that someone else does this sure great, and they went to the arcade.

47
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:26,468
Scott: there's like a mega Sega Game Center there and Nobody has looted the Sega Game Center for some reason maybe because everything's covered in radioactive dust.

48
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:30,650
Rym: yeah Like I imagine it'd be hard to get all that radioactive dust out of an area.

49
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:35,069
Scott: It's like an arcade that first of all some of the things in there still work, right?

50
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,582
Scott: But it's basically frozen in time right.

51
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:44,608
Scott: usually you go to old arcades And it's like you know you can see like the remnant pieces and stuff like that.

52
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:49,990
Scott: right But here the arcade has been frozen in time just abandoned and unchanged.

53
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:55,769
Scott: I guess it was flooded at one point at least in the bottom level probably, but it's like it's just sitting there.

54
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:00,884
Rym: Yeah, like you look at these pictures it stuff's just covered in dust and so the ceiling.

55
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:09,244
Scott: if you're curious about what year was that 11 2011 11 okay, so in 2011 you can basically see forever.

56
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:10,488
Scott: I guess for a long time.

57
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:16,949
Scott: We're gonna have it like a museum of arcade technology Japanese arcade.

58
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,219
Rym: It's kind of like a mini Vesuvius.

59
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:26,016
Scott: yes, there's a video and there's some other stuff To so you can examine it.

60
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:34,630
Scott: similarly I did see I don't have to find the link for it again There was a. there was a Twitter thread about the metreon in this thing.

61
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,268
Scott: It's in San Francisco right which was like the Sony building that Sony made in the 90s.

62
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,450
Scott: That was sort of like like a Disney Quest sort of situation thing with like fancy arcade.

63
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:49,322
Rym: I don't know if I know about that or I just think I know about.

64
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,050
Scott: I knew about it when it was a thing.

65
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:57,789
Scott: I feel like I saw a YouTube video about it But I wasn't paying because basically GDC is this year is gonna be in it or near it.

66
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:06,650
Scott: Oh the Twitter was like hey all GDC people go here and Look at the remnants of what was once the metroid and is now just like a sad movie theater.

67
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:12,901
Scott: But you can still see you know in these areas of the building What's left from the days when it was awesome in 90s.

68
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:15,130
Rym: so Scott what in your memory?

69
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,482
Rym: Let's go back to like middle school social studies or geography class.

70
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:20,430
Rym: What's the longest river in the world?

71
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:23,577
Scott: You know give me Amazon could be Nile.

72
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:25,723
Scott: you know something like that all right.

73
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:35,884
Rym: so as far as I can tell looking at Wikipedia Both the Amazon and the Nile are listed as the longest river in the world, okay I am 100% right.

74
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:36,990
Scott: I got both right answers.

75
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:43,088
Rym: So this is in my style recently a lot of my things that they have been things like this because this is the YouTube hole I've been going down.

76
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:54,220
Rym: But it basically it's one of those questions where there's a simple question And it turns out that for reasons the answer to that question is Potentially impossible to give

77
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,530
Scott: right because you you could you know the other end of a river That's pretty easy to find it usually at the ocean or something yep.

78
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:03,003
Scott: And then you go up the river, and there's the main part of it right.

79
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:09,544
Scott: That's all thick and tons of water Really river really easy to measure that right, but eventually you reach.

80
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:17,489
Scott: well eventually you reach a point we're like hey this river like has a fork and Each half of it is kind of yeah.

81
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,822
Scott: So maybe you take the wider half and they get another fork.

82
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:27,264
Scott: me like am I still on the same river Really, and then you see like your middle of the river And you see some water just going down from a hill nearby going into the river.

83
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:28,530
Rym: It's like tributaries.

84
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:32,816
Scott: It's like there's so many tributaries Right how can you measure?

85
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:39,240
Scott: and then there's also like you know rivers might get twisty and turny But there might be water like cutting across the twisty turny part.

86
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:40,906
Scott: so there's all sorts of things.

87
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:44,087
Scott: and then this way maybe Elevation changes in the river right.

88
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:50,589
Scott: it's like Oh, you know there's so many things You know how you you need to set a rules for measuring river length that are consistent.

89
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:50,890
Rym: yep.

90
00:06:51,030 --> 00:07:00,200
Rym: So the trickiest part is that even if we just go for that first part where you jumped in like say we agree on What part counts as the river and we ignore the whole tributary problem.

91
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:03,050
Rym: rivers lengths change so often?

92
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:05,748
Rym: that you'd have to constantly remeasure them.

93
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:12,070
Rym: and If you measure with more granularity the length of every river eventually becomes infinite.

94
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,262
Rym: Because what is the actual length?

95
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:15,810
Rym: which side of the river?

96
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,597
Rym: Do you measure like it gets?

97
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:20,530
Scott: I found I found the drop of water?

98
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:30,930
Scott: Hitting a leaf that goes and lands on the ground and rolls down a hill and goes in Slowly absorbs out of the soil and made it just moist enough for some flowing to happen.

99
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:35,260
Scott: So part of that eventually goes into the ocean And that's the river starts at that leaf on that tree.

100
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:39,916
Rym: so part of this is the same question as How long is a coastline?

101
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:43,625
Rym: because the answer is they're all infinitely long, and there's no way to measure that.

102
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:54,401
Rym: I Guess if you're measuring like what if it's really a really twisty tourney Coastline how much of that nonsense do you measure it versus just ignore?

103
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:56,567
Scott: It's still not infinite.

104
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:57,590
Rym: It's there.

105
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:01,969
Scott: There is definitely finite landmass.

106
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,994
Scott: It's just really big yeah, but Zoom all the way in now.

107
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:11,630
Rym: You've got the curvature of every individual molecule and atom of every piece of that land.

108
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:14,096
Rym: That's really stupid Yeah, but I'm saying what?

109
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:16,264
Rym: what is the unit of granularity that makes sense?

110
00:08:16,304 --> 00:08:18,231
Rym: because fucking ruler well What?

111
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:24,290
Scott: so you can't measure it with a ruler you can't measure so you quantize it into a straight one size one foot.

112
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,226
Rym: I'm just saying you got a size measuring depending on the number you pick.

113
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:32,301
Scott: if I'm at the beach I take my tape measure and I go and I'm measuring the the.

114
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:44,764
Rym: the fact that one grain of sand is slightly set back Yeah, but all I'm saying is that depending on the granularity you pick and I'm talking even like one foot versus one inch Completely changes the answer, but see this is the point.

115
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:47,056
Scott: see it's interesting to say I'm measuring a river.

116
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,584
Scott: tricky because tributaries.

117
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:53,370
Scott: if you're making this argument You're basically saying nothing can be measured which is completely stupid.

118
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:54,194
Scott: I don't know.

119
00:08:54,294 --> 00:09:02,070
Rym: so pointless know because you can measure straight line distances easily And you can actually measure like road distances the air molecules.

120
00:09:02,572 --> 00:09:06,230
Rym: What's hard to knock is what's hard with a curvature of space-time?

121
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:06,692
Scott: We might be.

122
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,301
Scott: how fast is that ruler moving?

123
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:09,930
Rym: we can account for all those things the one.

124
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:24,784
Rym: This is the specific problem of if you're trying to measure an outline of a thing Like a coastline I very specifically a coastline Depending on if your granularity is an inch or a foot or a yard.

125
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:32,280
Rym: the answer to the question Like say what state has the longest coastline changes Because some coastlines are really craggy and some aren't.

126
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:35,110
Rym: if you measure it a yard granularity that might make more sense.

127
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:40,465
Rym: But that also ignores all the crazy twisty tourney that might exist in like parts of Maine.

128
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:41,408
Scott: measure it with a fucking.

129
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:51,041
Scott: if you can See it from a plane then accounts all right, but someone was 20/20 vision Boris vision good vision Some sort of laser measuring device from the play.

130
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:52,125
Rym: How is that plane flying?

131
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,250
Scott: It's a low flying plane.

132
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,502
Scott: Yeah, I'm just saying like like the kind that carries an advertisement for the beach.

133
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:58,610
Scott: That's how you pay for the measuring research.

134
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:10,285
Rym: So yeah in the meta moment like I said the book club The GeekNights book club is a long and storied tradition of announcing books and then Not actually getting to do them for a while and then reading them in a hurry and doing a show.

135
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:11,249
Scott: I read the book.

136
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:17,310
Rym: Yep, I will ever read by well before next Thursday when we will do the next game.

137
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:19,156
Scott: Not only I've did I read that book.

138
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:22,006
Scott: I've mostly read a much longer book.

139
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:23,270
Rym: Oh, you're getting back into the show.

140
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:26,150
Scott: I mean, that's the book that was on my kindlef.

141
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,374
Rym: That's is so yet.

142
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:32,152
Rym: Did you get to the part where you where you might say wow this is actually Evangelion.

143
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,501
Scott: yet, I mean it's been like this is book one.

144
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:42,392
Rym: Yeah, but it gets you think you might think okay It's Evangelion, and then it hits a point where it gets way more Evangelion.

145
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:44,964
Scott: I mean it gets more even gel in every chapter.

146
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:48,803
Rym: Yeah, it keeps getting more Evangelion and the end is Evangelion there.

147
00:10:48,823 --> 00:10:50,169
Scott: it is it's good biz.

148
00:10:50,854 --> 00:11:04,266
Rym: But the GeekNights book club has done a lot of books And if you don't want to worry about the fickle realities of Rym and Scott or particularly Rym in this case actually finishing the book That we're currently reading we've read a ton of books and not

149
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:07,619
Scott: because you read them often Just because GeekNights has been going on for too long Yeah

150
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:18,608
Rym: And we've done pretty intense episodes of us talking about those books like Steppenwolf a farewell to arms snow crash Great, etc.

151
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:25,448
Rym: Otherwise we will be live at PAX East doing a panel the real harm of games.

152
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:27,346
Scott: I guess I had to finish making.

153
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:29,055
Rym: yes You do only got a few.

154
00:11:29,095 --> 00:11:31,806
Rym: GeekNights will also be at Zenkaikan doing a bunch of panels.

155
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,097
Rym: I At some point.

156
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:36,190
Rym: I should look up what panels were doing.

157
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:42,873
Rym: I think I will try to do that tonight and make a post about it because I need to figure out what I need to prepare For Zenkaikan.

158
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:43,897
Rym: I'm gonna be there.

159
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:46,324
Rym: my panels are probably all on Saturday.

160
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:47,027
Rym: There's a chance.

161
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:48,889
Rym: There's one on Sunday I will not.

162
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:58,441
Rym: The only GeekNights panel that'll occur on Friday is I will be drinking at one of the pubs near the convention center And I will probably not at any point enter the convention center.

163
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:03,542
Rym: if you find me in one of those pubs You can talk to me, and I guess that'll count as a GeekNights event.

164
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:07,458
Rym: so yeah other than that I think we should get right into the tech news roundup.

165
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,021
Scott: all right.

166
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:10,350
Scott: What tech news did you round up mr.. Tech news round.

167
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,250
Rym: Oh, all right, so I put these in random order based on what?

168
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:17,180
Scott: Tech news rodeo Rym yep, so wrangler here.

169
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,721
Rym: first thing.

170
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:22,408
Rym: first the news that it's a big news And there's a lot to talk about here.

171
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:40,250
Rym: It's technology and it's technology adjacent, but there's a whole clusterfuck around YouTube cracking down on the monetization of YouTube videos where Pedophiles and Nazis have posted things in the comments.

172
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:45,635
Scott: Yeah, so like you know some kids say have like you know Gymnastics or something.

173
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:49,150
Scott: yep, so you got like elementary school kids doing gymnastics and say the school.

174
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,719
Rym: So the video that parents.

175
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:55,321
Scott: some parents take an innocent video and they put it on YouTube so that the other parents can watch it.

176
00:12:55,522 --> 00:13:07,206
Scott: yep, and then some pedophiles find it and one person's innocent video about Elementary school gymnastics is someone else's fat yep, and then you know that is a problem.

177
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,650
Rym: as old as internet is The internet is exist now people have been able to post content.

178
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,022
Scott: That would just be a thing that people realize.

179
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:28,290
Scott: try not to think about yep If it weren't for the fact that those people on the fab side then go into the comments and trade Links to other similar videos and do not say lots of bad things in the comments.

180
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:31,605
Scott: So those videos that they show me saying so that's one aspect.

181
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:42,921
Rym: you've got this problem That has always existed, but is now existing at scale because of the cruel realities of a modern People Collecting lots of video footage of children.

182
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:49,608
Scott: that is not technically child porn But you find a playlist that make you know something that makes it through YouTube's.

183
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,309
Scott: you know It's it's just videos of children.

184
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:53,855
Rym: But then yeah but here's the problem.

185
00:13:53,895 --> 00:14:01,150
Scott: so they feel like if I went to the beach and I videoed like Hot girls in bikinis because they're on the beach, and then I just made a compilation video.

186
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,632
Scott: It's like I'm like.

187
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:02,335
Scott: it's not porn here.

188
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:02,999
Scott: It is on YouTube.

189
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,521
Scott: Yeah.

190
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,164
Scott: I'm watch my.

191
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:05,450
Scott: I'd get a lot of hits with that.

192
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:06,869
Scott: I'm sure there is that on you, too.

193
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:19,433
Rym: so you know the problem of you find a YouTube video and then you find like a playlist that that YouTube video is in and then you look and that playlist is Oddly specific.

194
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,499
Rym: it's definitely someone's fat material.

195
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:35,775
Scott: there are lots and lots of things that are not technically in and of themselves Crossing the line, but yeah, not just pornography, but hate speech and Nazi stuff too, but yet are obviously Crossing the line.

196
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:37,422
Rym: yep like for example.

197
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:42,922
Rym: There is another terrible Parallel to this that YouTube is not doing anything specifically about.

198
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:56,230
Rym: but it happens, and I've seen discussion about it There'll be a lot of videos that are all clustered together that are all themselves Innocently uploaded or at least ostensibly initially up innocently uploaded by like police stations and security cameras.

199
00:14:56,814 --> 00:15:04,760
Rym: But someone will collect all those videos selectively only include Certain of those videos and make a compilation.

200
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:12,750
Rym: That's basically people of race X committing crimes Because they've removed all the white people that were in the other videos that committed those same crimes.

201
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,197
Scott: So why don't we make white people committing crime?

202
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:15,960
Rym: Maybe we should.

203
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,549
Rym: that's what we should make the YouTube channel white people committing crimes.

204
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,498
Rym: I Feel like I don't want to watch that channel.

205
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,905
Rym: I don't know any of these channels.

206
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:23,710
Rym: It's called cops.

207
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:25,139
Scott: It was on national television.

208
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,609
Scott: I'm sure maybe it still is so.

209
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:29,257
Rym: So that is in itself a problem.

210
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:36,181
Rym: the reason why this becomes a technology issue is a Related orthogonal thing that happened.

211
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:47,930
Rym: YouTube has a video recommendation engine that tries to figure out based on what you looked at what videos you would be likely to Continue to watch so that you just keep fucking watching YouTube forever.

212
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,242
Scott: So and it works by looking at other people and it's like.

213
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:55,198
Scott: well that person other people who watch this video Also watch these videos.

214
00:15:55,238 --> 00:16:00,690
Scott: so that means if you watch this video You'll probably like the things that other people who watch this video like yep.

215
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,424
Rym: So let's see I'm gonna go to my youtube right now and see what it thinks like.

216
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:06,206
Scott: if I just go to youtube.com It's gonna tell you to watch like.

217
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,676
Rym: Okay, here's what it wants me to see.

218
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:13,750
Rym: here's a whole bunch of likes clips from Star Trek bunch of Star Trek nonsense.

219
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,327
Rym: Here's a bunch of games done quick stuff a bunch of more Star Trek nonsense.

220
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:20,250
Scott: Oh, it seems like it works.

221
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:21,474
Rym: Yeah, this is all.

222
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:25,850
Rym: these are all things I would click on because that is the kind of stuff that I watch on YouTube.

223
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:26,454
Rym: So it knows.

224
00:16:27,158 --> 00:17:07,708
Rym: but let's say and a reporter I forget what note that was for did this for this YouTube story if you watch a bunch of unrelated videos that happen to prominently featured children on YouTube YouTube will start recommending to you Only those videos and you see a really bad cluster in a hurry that gets really rapidly into actually bad like bad on purpose content mm-hmm, so the algorithm is Allowing pedophiles and Nazis and bad people to more easily find the kinds of stuff they want to see even if what they want to see was not uploaded with the intention of giving it to them.

225
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:16,290
Rym: and Those kinds of people tend to use the internet very heavily and comment very heavily and the algorithms seem to over represent them.

226
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:25,682
Rym: That's why if you take a blank YouTube account and watch any video about movies You're almost immediately going to be recommended some misogynistic shitbag.

227
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:28,831
Rym: talking about why the new Ghostbusters is anti-male Mm-hmm.

228
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:31,760
Rym: Like this is a technology problem.

229
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:44,630
Scott: that probably real technology problem is That there is so much video uploaded to YouTube every second That it is impossible to check it all with humans now that also wouldn't be a problem.

230
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:50,290
Scott: Maybe the algorithms just say and the algorithms know even the best algorithm in the world is not any good.

231
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:56,570
Rym: So maybe the algorithm should ignore channels that have less than like 5,000 subscribers or something.

232
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:58,217
Scott: I mean there's things like that they can do.

233
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:00,990
Scott: but you know, yeah, so how do you know those channels?

234
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,696
Scott: Probably don't have less than so.

235
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:08,379
Rym: this intersects very heavily people with the huge Monetization model of YouTube right?

236
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,649
Scott: so people get mad when I say this.

237
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:14,370
Scott: But I don't think YouTube should pay anyone who uploads videos.

238
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:15,916
Rym: I agree a hundred percent right.

239
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:19,170
Scott: people are like, oh no, but all these youtubers like that's their job.

240
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,033
Scott: You're saying they shouldn't.

241
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,201
Scott: I say this fully full disclosure.

242
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:24,890
Rym: I make decent money from our YouTube videos, right?

243
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,417
Scott: I'm like, you know, you're like.

244
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:32,050
Scott: no these craters need to be compensated and it's like well, hold on You're being compensated because you're getting free video hosting.

245
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,096
Scott: Do you have any idea how much free video hosting costs?

246
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:35,520
Scott: because a fortune.

247
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:38,750
Scott: try to buy a web server and serve video.

248
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:40,220
Scott: Look at your bandwidth bill.

249
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:44,136
Scott: if you have any kind of viewership Yeah, right Look at your storage that it's gonna take up.

250
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:57,596
Scott: look at all the trans coding you have to do to deliver though that video to every single possible device on earth and high quality and like such fast loading times to run your own personal YouTube would cost you a Fortune.

251
00:18:57,777 --> 00:18:59,428
Rym: now the proper your own videos.

252
00:18:59,468 --> 00:18:59,630
Scott: now.

253
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:05,570
Rym: I would be fine with YouTube providing a way for you to make a deal with an advertise.

254
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:10,130
Scott: You are so big on YouTube that you're you know, you deserve to be compensated.

255
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:16,746
Scott: You could get compensated by you know Making deals with people for like product placement your videos sponsored videos all kinds.

256
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:17,749
Scott: I'd also be okay.

257
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,050
Scott: I just don't think YouTube should be paying you because then we can well, oh well, here's the caveat.

258
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:29,419
Rym: I don't think YouTube should be paying you for revenue from a generic sized ad distribution service.

259
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:38,990
Rym: right if you make it fine if you Because someone subscribed to your channel and agreed to pay a dollar a month for you Like you're a tiny cable channel.

260
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:43,167
Scott: This monetize demonetize based on your content thing.

261
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:43,870
Scott: It's like no no, no.

262
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,336
Rym: Well, because there's the problem that monetize.

263
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:58,930
Rym: demonetize specifically means that if it's quote unquote monetized Advertisers you will never interact with are paying YouTube Directly for ads and YouTube is using other algorithms to say put these ads on these random videos.

264
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,800
Scott: What it should be is by default.

265
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,906
Scott: No one is monetized.

266
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:04,664
Scott: to get monetized You have to like make a contract and sign a deal.

267
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:06,851
Rym: Yeah with an Advertiser.

268
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:08,617
Rym: Yeah, not YouTube.

269
00:20:08,697 --> 00:20:09,520
Rym: Maybe more YouTube.

270
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:10,002
Rym: You do.

271
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,370
Scott: my YouTube is like, okay, we're just let's sign a deal.

272
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,718
Scott: Yeah, you specifically your content is good.

273
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:15,280
Scott: We like you.

274
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,130
Scott: Yeah, and otherwise nothing you make should be monetized.

275
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,885
Scott: You should be glad that you're getting free hosting.

276
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:20,430
Scott: That's your monitor.

277
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:34,416
Rym: But the fact that YouTube is trying to monetize this based on basically AI and algorithms and ad networks Made this come to a head because the advertisers who buy YouTube ads tend to just buy them in bulk And it just makes sense to do like.

278
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:35,400
Rym: that's how you advertise.

279
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:37,388
Rym: and then suddenly they all realized.

280
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:37,870
Rym: Wait a minute.

281
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,507
Scott: The reason Google doesn't want to do this is basically that kills their inventory.

282
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:47,290
Scott: Yep It also like but but it would also jack up the price on the inventory that it have.

283
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:54,752
Rym: Well, I would also say that most of the people who are the loudest about how monetization like the monetization as exists today has to Stay alive.

284
00:20:54,773 --> 00:21:03,510
Rym: our channels with like less than a thousand subscribers Like if even if you're quote unquote monetized you're making like 20 bucks a month.

285
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:05,850
Rym: That is not enough money to bother.

286
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:08,858
Rym: Yeah If you rely on that to make your channel.

287
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:11,527
Rym: your problem is not with YouTube model is monetization.

288
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:16,677
Scott: your problem with People Problem is they already did it right.

289
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,002
Scott: so people get real mad.

290
00:21:18,022 --> 00:21:19,890
Scott: if you take any money away from them, right?

291
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:20,615
Scott: They're getting a dollar.

292
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,562
Scott: you take away that dollar.

293
00:21:21,602 --> 00:21:22,327
Scott: Oh, that's so mad.

294
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,329
Rym: Yep Well, they also seem to think that they're gonna get big one day.

295
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:31,226
Scott: But anyway, the problem is I also think the editor shouldn't have comments at all.

296
00:21:31,527 --> 00:21:32,590
Rym: Uh, yeah, we'll get back to that.

297
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:34,937
Scott: So why does that have cut?

298
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:39,892
Scott: what everyone all people do is talk about bad YouTube comments are they're so rarely Worthwhile.

299
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:50,939
Scott: the only YouTube comments that are ever worthwhile are the ones that have a timecode so you can skip to the good part of the video like like in a speedrun and The ones that give you extra info that the video didn't include.

300
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,808
Scott: otherwise comments on YouTube are pretty much 99.9% worthless.

301
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,098
Scott: I'm willing to sacrifice the good ones.

302
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:58,409
Scott: Just delete all YouTube comments and never bring them back.

303
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:00,550
Scott: I would you want comments on your videos?

304
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,222
Scott: Let people email you and contact you the creator directly somehow like Twitter or something.

305
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:10,220
Scott: or or embed your video on your blog with the Comments under and then it does come into your problem.

306
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:25,770
Rym: or if I were YouTube, you know what I would do Provide an API because if you're big enough you might want comments, but YouTube just provides the UI In YouTube for that but the comments actually go through whatever internal system you've got for moderation.

307
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:27,985
Scott: Because the main reason that's got a lot of problems.

308
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:30,695
Rym: Well Well, that's just another platform.

309
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:31,698
Rym: It's a commenting plan.

310
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:34,586
Scott: I put my comments on YouTube and that's it's like.

311
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:35,629
Scott: that's a huge problem.

312
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:35,950
Scott: Why?

313
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,693
Scott: Technologically speaking?

314
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:41,082
Scott: now, it's like I'm infesting YouTube with my with my comment.

315
00:22:41,122 --> 00:22:43,750
Rym: Yeah, I've built that semi federated.

316
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,102
Rym: The problem with YouTube comments too.

317
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:53,238
Rym: is that like on our channel the comments are actually pretty good Because the kinds of people that watch our videos.

318
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,743
Rym: we're not like mass-market.

319
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:56,930
Scott: I'm willing to sacrifice my YouTube.

320
00:22:57,371 --> 00:23:04,155
Rym: Yeah, well also I'd leave comments on but I every now and if I gained any sort of traction on YouTube I would I would.

321
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,666
Rym: just I would end comments permanently if I had my druthers.

322
00:23:06,706 --> 00:23:07,027
Rym: Don't worry.

323
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:07,630
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

324
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:15,423
Rym: this is the same conversation that webcomics had back when webcomics first became big and suddenly every webcomic had its own forum.

325
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:20,650
Rym: that was full of bullshit and A bunch of voices came out and said why does a webcomic even need a forum?

326
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:21,551
Rym: Like.

327
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:21,933
Rym: why does it?

328
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:24,490
Scott: because the reason of a form is because you're trying to build a community.

329
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,804
Scott: Yeah for your audience right be to have you have a community.

330
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,190
Scott: You got to manage the community.

331
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:30,930
Rym: I'm like the GeekNights forum we manage.

332
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:33,745
Scott: You know if you're trying to make money and not like.

333
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:37,882
Scott: we're not trying to make money But if you are you got to translate the community into money somehow.

334
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:37,962
Scott: Yep.

335
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:39,990
Rym: The only reason the GeekNights community works.

336
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:41,730
Rym: I think the GeekNights community is really good.

337
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,936
Rym: I really like our forum.

338
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:45,630
Rym: culture is because one we're not trying to make money.

339
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,608
Rym: So we're more than willing to tell Nazis and pedophiles to fuck off.

340
00:23:49,353 --> 00:23:57,827
Rym: But YouTube as much as they don't want to admit it Rely on pedophiles and Nazis for a big enough percentage of their revenue to where now they're in trouble over it.

341
00:23:57,847 --> 00:23:58,249
Rym: Mm-hmm.

342
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,344
Rym: So this situation is big and the solutions are things no one wants to hear.

343
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:17,800
Rym: because the end result of all this so far is that Advertisers said whoa YouTube unless you can guarantee that my video my ad will not be shown next to some pedophile nonsense I'm not buying any more YouTube ads.

344
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:18,424
Rym: full stop.

345
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:22,801
Scott: if you're an advertiser The thing is usually I'm in favor of things to hurt advertisers.

346
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,650
Scott: Both of these policies are pro advertiser.

347
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:28,839
Scott: If you're an advertiser you buy YouTube ads.

348
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:34,274
Scott: they put your ads on all kinds of videos videos that are probably Mostly by bots.

349
00:24:34,355 --> 00:24:40,989
Scott: you target them somewhat, but you don't target them, you know, you know like perfectly, you know You can't narrow it down that much.

350
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:45,924
Scott: Yeah Your ad could show up on my video if someone done without adblock watches it.

351
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:48,012
Scott: if you like buy a gaming ad or something Right.

352
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:51,189
Scott: that can happen and that was just a worthless ad buy for you.

353
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:52,936
Scott: They should make it to where.

354
00:24:53,337 --> 00:25:06,141
Scott: if you're an ad buyer you specifically list the exact Videos and channels that you want your ad to appear on and it will not appear anywhere else Right, and it's like, okay all you other people everyone can be monetized now,

355
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:09,050
Rym: but all right, and then YouTube just provides

356
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:19,890
Scott: ripping off advertisers by playing their ads and making them pay to show those ads on All these garbage videos all over YouTube with all this worthless inventory.

357
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:22,390
Rym: So I think a lot of people are buying ads.

358
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,135
Rym: I mean this is my speculation.

359
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:27,036
Scott: Google lets you have some of the YouTube money But they're every time someone watches that ad.

360
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:31,530
Scott: they also get money from the advertisers by selling your worthless video inventory.

361
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:38,110
Rym: I suspect a lot of the people buying ads are starting to question the value of the YouTube advertising network as a whole.

362
00:25:38,491 --> 00:25:39,094
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

363
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:42,047
Scott: I mean, I don't know why people who buy ads buy any online ads.

364
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:42,770
Scott: They're all worthless.

365
00:25:43,012 --> 00:26:00,654
Rym: Well, I think the big difference is that Because it's a lot of work to figure out where to advertise assuming an advertisers acting in good faith that Everyone who tries to sell an advertiser ad space is probably ripping them off and the ad networks just made the problem disappear But not go away.

366
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:02,821
Scott: It's because ad buyers right.

367
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:04,307
Scott: if you're an ad buyer, that's your job.

368
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:05,712
Scott: That's actually a job You can have.

369
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:07,198
Scott: yeah is you're not you don't make.

370
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:08,362
Rym: I have been an ad buyer.

371
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:09,507
Rym: I've done that professionally.

372
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,350
Rym: it fucking sucks.

373
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:17,350
Scott: No, like there's people that's their full-time job is yeah, someone else makes the ads they you know Like they're not the creative person like comes up with cool ads.

374
00:26:17,712 --> 00:26:26,198
Scott: They just go around buying ad inventory to and then getting those ads to play there And what they do is then they go and show their boss Look look where I got our look.

375
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:29,210
Scott: if you watch this awesome popular YouTube video our ad shows up.

376
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,765
Scott: Look, if you look at at this billboard in Times Square.

377
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:32,449
Scott: our ad is there.

378
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,780
Scott: Yeah, aren't you proud of all the places our company is?

379
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:35,805
Scott: look we're on the Super Bowl.

380
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:37,568
Scott: Look look at all the places I got us.

381
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:44,270
Scott: They don't have ever actually proved because they can't that those ads were effective or those are good buys or anything like that.

382
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:50,410
Scott: All they do is impress the boss by making them proud of all the places their company logo has appeared, right?

383
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:53,760
Scott: So that's the person who decides where to buy ads.

384
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,870
Scott: they don't give a fuck if they're effective or if the money is well spent.

385
00:26:57,151 --> 00:27:09,230
Scott: They just want to increase their department's budget and impress the boss by having the company logo and ad appear in the most, you know Prestigious places, so there's a lot going on with that and we'll just move on to something else.

386
00:27:09,652 --> 00:27:12,084
Rym: So here's the funny one cops in Winnipeg.

387
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:22,476
Rym: I guess they use encryption software to encrypt the Communication they do on their radios to prevent people like me from just listening to the police blotter I guess in Canada.

388
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:27,254
Scott: It's not like the US where the police radio has to be Unencrypted or whatever.

389
00:27:27,415 --> 00:27:27,877
Rym: I'm pretty.

390
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:31,191
Rym: I think there are jurisdictions in the US now where it's encrypted It's.

391
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:39,447
Scott: I don't know what the law is regarding that but I mean there is a culture in the u.s Of people listening to police when I was a kid has historically been very unencrypted.

392
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:45,545
Rym: when I was a kid Or you can just listen when I was a kid We had a 14 channel police scanner that we just left on in the house.

393
00:27:45,565 --> 00:27:46,650
Scott: They just sold him a RadioShack.

394
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:50,950
Scott: Yeah, you can go to RadioShack buy one of these things and then be a crazy old man listening to police radio.

395
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:54,307
Rym: Yeah, but then what you had to do is know which crystal you have citizen app.

396
00:27:54,347 --> 00:28:02,402
Rym: You don't need it yeah, you have to know which crystals to buy to put into the slots because Variable frequency tuning radios like that for police stuff.

397
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:04,629
Rym: We're not available to the public are much easier.

398
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:05,753
Scott: now In fact is out.

399
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:07,118
Rym: there's a software that there's.

400
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:07,419
Scott: also.

401
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:10,249
Scott: there are certain kinds of radios that are gonna be going like out of.

402
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:12,477
Scott: Possibly might be illegal soon.

403
00:28:12,497 --> 00:28:14,666
Scott: So people are ham nerds are buying them up lately.

404
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:15,047
Scott: Yep.

405
00:28:15,168 --> 00:28:19,829
Rym: It's a certain kind I forget but yeah as a kid like when we were driving around we'd listen to the police because it was fun.

406
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:21,556
Rym: Like did we'd listen to?

407
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,964
Rym: we just listen to cops like heaven thing is like.

408
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:29,142
Scott: doing it like a little bit is fun Right, but doing it a whole bunch gets real boring and real.

409
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:31,530
Scott: it's like if you keep doing it then it becomes a problem.

410
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,446
Rym: Yeah, like I feel like at that point you're storing jars of your own pee.

411
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:40,888
Scott: Yeah It's like I only check citizen app when like I heard way too many sirens people were like staring at citizen app.

412
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:41,469
Scott: That's a problem.

413
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:44,625
Rym: So basically is best I can tell.

414
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:57,140
Rym: what happened here is that the police were using these encrypted radios and there's a company that provides the encryption software and And they need to be updated frequently and to update them.

415
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,447
Rym: You need to buy a refresh key from the company.

416
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:05,059
Rym: Mm-hmm and Motorola charged $94 per update per radio.

417
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:07,790
Rym: Mm-hmm, and there were lots of radios.

418
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:15,569
Rym: so Someone bought a bunch of these keys and I made finger quotes here because they bought them.

419
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:28,481
Rym: the same way You're buying a Windows 10 key on a website somewhere and bought 65,000 of them and told the police you don't want to know where these came from and the police have been pirating the software and It's a big goddamn deal now.

420
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,437
Scott: Oh The police should be pirating.

421
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:47,210
Rym: Yeah, I think the problem is I don't want Civil infrastructure in any country to be reliant on a single privately held vendor or Public company that is not public in the government owns it.

422
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:51,733
Scott: The best thing to do would be for the government to just say a law and be like, hey Guess what?

423
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:54,230
Scott: You have to provide you have to give it to us for free top shit.

424
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,730
Scott: We make a law we can just tell you to do whatever we want.

425
00:29:57,553 --> 00:30:00,423
Scott: But if they're failing that piracy next best choice?

426
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:05,266
Rym: or how about a law that says, you know police radios have to be encrypted blah blah blah.

427
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:10,219
Rym: and here is a. vendors have to provide it at a statutory cost.

428
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,166
Rym: and here's the list of vendors that have to provide it.

429
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:19,710
Rym: and you could make a Regulation that balances free market economics with the fact that the government shouldn't rely on private companies for shit like this.

430
00:30:20,311 --> 00:30:22,137
Rym: But instead it looks like these couches pirated it.

431
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:23,421
Rym: I didn't read the full story.

432
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:24,124
Scott: Sounds good.

433
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:25,910
Rym: All right, let's move on.

434
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:30,695
Rym: So as we know for a long time They have like the FCC.

435
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:40,264
Rym: one of the things the FCC is supposed to do is get public comments to inform decision-making around the kind of technology the FCC is in charge of.

436
00:30:40,284 --> 00:30:41,767
Rym: mm-hmm makes sense, right?

437
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:50,686
Rym: Yeah, so If it wasn't obvious to all of you basically those comments for a long time now have been entirely fake generated by like.

438
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:55,622
Rym: Russian bot farms and Lobbyists in the US filled out that form to make comments.

439
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:57,530
Scott: It's hard to fill out that form with a lot of stuff.

440
00:30:57,872 --> 00:31:00,670
Scott: Yeah, it shouldn't be hard to figure out which ones are fake.

441
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:07,154
Rym: I think before the Russian trolls and bot farms and lobbyists started doing it automatically I'm pretty sure.

442
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:15,470
Rym: even in the old days they made it hard to do on purpose to keep people like us Because it's an old shitty government website and you got to fill in all those bureaucratic crap.

443
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:18,712
Rym: Yep so I guess the broader question is One.

444
00:31:18,732 --> 00:31:23,290
Rym: there are only two ways to address this problem now because I we can't do a whole show on this right now.

445
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:24,566
Rym: We got a lot of news to cover.

446
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:35,438
Rym: either We need to Forget the idea that the FCC gets comments from the public because there's literally no way to do it Effectively like it's just gonna be spammed.

447
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:36,765
Rym: There's no way to control it.

448
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:47,110
Rym: or Nerds need to make their own troll farms to flood the FCC With the actually right things to do around things like net neutrality.

449
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:57,278
Rym: I feel like the collected nerds in America could send more comments to the FCC that are prone at neutrality than all the lobbyists Next time there's a thing.

450
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,322
Scott: I'm not even hiding it.

451
00:31:58,382 --> 00:31:59,265
Scott: I'm just going for it.

452
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:00,008
Scott: I think we should.

453
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:05,350
Scott: we're gonna go We're gonna flood that shit and we're gonna go to tech war because that's not hard to do.

454
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:06,575
Rym: It's like the toner war.

455
00:32:06,595 --> 00:32:08,201
Scott: It's a really easy tech war to fight.

456
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:10,430
Rym: It is bot bot farmers bot farm.

457
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:15,386
Scott: I'll make a program and I'll say everyone run this program run it instead of your Bitcoin miner.

458
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:20,300
Rym: Yep, right Maybe you use a simple pseudo AI on grandma's.

459
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,002
Rym: easy.

460
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:24,070
Rym: It generates a slightly different message from everybody.

461
00:32:24,974 --> 00:32:25,597
Scott: All kinds of stuff.

462
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:28,350
Rym: I mean Russia's ahead of us and I've had of our country on this game.

463
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,576
Rym: I feel like nerds in the u.s.

464
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:30,219
Rym: Needs to step up.

465
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,581
Rym: Yep.

466
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:32,209
Rym: All right, let's move along too.

467
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:43,263
Rym: So I saw this article and a lot of people think that they because they pay some random Scandinavian or Nordic sounding company like Nord VPN.

468
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:44,587
Rym: Yep, five bucks a month.

469
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:49,181
Rym: It's not a bad VPN Yeah, but there's a lot of them that are vaguely Nordic sounding.

470
00:32:49,562 --> 00:32:52,130
Scott: Yeah that I think Nord VPN is actually from Panama.

471
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:54,850
Rym: Yeah, you see where I'm going with this.

472
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:08,624
Rym: Anyway, if you pay one of these people some amount a month and you have all your internet traffic on your phone go through a VPN Then your privacy is protected Somewhat and that is sort of true, but not really to protecting yourself.

473
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:10,410
Scott: Your ISP won't see your traffic, right?

474
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:16,790
Scott: So you got one of those ISPs that keeps shutting you down for downloading, you know, brand-new Hollywood movies all the time.

475
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:22,175
Scott: Yeah, the VPN will 99% probably protect you from that To this day.

476
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:30,053
Rym: I I will not confirm or deny but I'm confident that that kind of traffic is traverse this network In volume.

477
00:33:30,354 --> 00:33:34,309
Rym: over the last decade in my entire life an ISP has never come after me.

478
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:42,444
Scott: No I don't understand how this happens to other people as I'm downloading not Like the brand-new because they're only looking at like specific things right like who's downloading.

479
00:33:42,464 --> 00:33:43,306
Scott: What's a really new movie?

480
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:44,450
Scott: That's super hot, right?

481
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,241
Scott: Yeah, like a movie that was in theaters like fucking right now.

482
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:48,185
Scott: They're looking for that shit.

483
00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:48,948
Scott: They're not looking for.

484
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:54,838
Scott: Korean variety shows out bit torrent Season six of Adventure Time that door.

485
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:59,659
Rym: they're not looking for that, but there's this article that's just like How do you decide which VPN to trust in?

486
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,010
Rym: the one there's a website Scott's linked to a million times.

487
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:05,804
Scott: Yeah, it's I think it's called that security that one privacy site.

488
00:34:05,884 --> 00:34:18,670
Scott: Yep, and it basically has a whole spreadsheet of every major VPN provider and all the you know Basically details about which ones have which features and you can decide for yourself which one you want to trust.

489
00:34:19,212 --> 00:34:22,650
Scott: And if you trust this site, I trust that one privacy site.

490
00:34:22,871 --> 00:34:23,273
Scott: You know what?

491
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:27,009
Rym: It has the same kind of look that the actual putty site has.

492
00:34:27,972 --> 00:34:29,719
Scott: This has the look of a trustworthy website.

493
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:33,449
Rym: Yeah, it actually kind of does which is funny We're not joking.

494
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,409
Scott: It looks like a certain a site that a nerd a certain kind of nerd put a lot of effort into.

495
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,929
Rym: It is definitely not fake a site that has in all caps.

496
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:45,110
Rym: Please be patient as it may take some time for the sheet to load.

497
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,489
Rym: There's a certain kind of person who types those words into a website.

498
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:55,007
Rym: But this this question comes up a lot in mainstream technology news.

499
00:34:55,087 --> 00:34:56,090
Rym: I want to address it right now.

500
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:03,210
Rym: Anytime you're using anything to control what people people see about your data like VPNs privacy stuff.

501
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:11,650
Rym: You've just the question is do you trust company a or company B or company C or nerd D who emailed you?

502
00:35:12,692 --> 00:35:14,921
Rym: The only question is how do you decide who to trust?

503
00:35:14,981 --> 00:35:17,793
Rym: because you gotta trust someone Like.

504
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:20,501
Rym: there's no way to know that a VPN is secure.

505
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:23,110
Rym: You've got to trust someone's word on it at some point.

506
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:25,861
Rym: There's no way for you to ever figure this out on your own.

507
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:27,969
Scott: Yeah, I talked to Rym through a secret tunnel.

508
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:29,679
Scott: great We know no one is spying on us.

509
00:35:30,222 --> 00:35:31,268
Scott: What if Rym is spying on?

510
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:35,815
Rym: Yep If I'm spying on Scott or Scott spying on me One of us is fine.

511
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:40,430
Scott: All right, the connection between my computer and Amazon's computer is a hundred percent sealed and secure.

512
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:49,249
Scott: No one can spy on us and I tell Amazon my credit card number so they can let me buy something and then Amazon steals my credit card, yep, it's like Alright, here's one.

513
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:58,513
Rym: so in gaming a big problem in online gaming competitive gaming competitive online ortho gaming is Cheating right?

514
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:06,743
Scott: So most games these days, you know big multiplayer online games have some sort of anti-cheat Technologies built in the steam vac.

515
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:07,870
Scott: There's all kinds of stuff, right?

516
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:17,786
Scott: So there's some very popular anti-cheat software that has not been named and for some reason In Windows 10 in this one preview built.

517
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:25,636
Scott: so Windows 10 If you don't realize most of you are probably just using normalize Windows 10 or Windows 7 even and maybe Windows 8 Who knows not.

518
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:27,790
Scott: was there a 9 and skip 9 right anyway?

519
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:41,705
Rym: Yeah, they skip 9 because they were worried that the string like win 9 X like win 9 would be confused by Shitty old programs who look for win 9 5 anyway win 9 a. there was a string problem.

520
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:50,470
Scott: Anyway, the point is that There's preview builds you can get and you can get newer future versions of Windows 10 before they're released.

521
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,157
Scott: And there's one that like updates every day.

522
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:52,960
Scott: That's like super hot.

523
00:36:53,603 --> 00:37:00,430
Scott: and there's one that's like, okay This one's more stable, but it's it's still way ahead of the one that normal people are using, right?

524
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:16,689
Scott: So that super hot one has this bug where if you're using playing certain games Which is actually quite a few serious big-name games that have anti-cheat certain anti-cheat software You will get the green screen of death trying to play those games pretty much consistently because of this bug.

525
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:30,339
Rym: now I would suspect part of the issue is that anti-cheat software to be successful needs to do a lot of the kinds of things that computers don't want you to do like Inspecting the memory that another application is using right?

526
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:33,448
Scott: So Microsoft I guess knows which patch they made.

527
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:34,290
Scott: that's causing this.

528
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:35,649
Scott: But they're not unpatching it.

529
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,270
Scott: They want the anti-cheat software to make a patch and it has not done.

530
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:55,293
Scott: So the result is that that other preview build the sort of more stable one, which is used a lot by gaming people who kind of people would overclock and yeah frames rates and all those kinds of people are actually one of the biggest consumers Of that build.

531
00:37:55,614 --> 00:37:59,690
Scott: the more stable not super nightly, but way ahead of normal people build.

532
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:01,524
Scott: I forget they have names for them.

533
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:05,017
Scott: But anyway They're big consumer of that build.

534
00:38:05,558 --> 00:38:17,738
Scott: so even though Microsoft would like to update that build more frequently They haven't updated it in a super long-ass time you know because They can't because they'll crack the green screen of death.

535
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,443
Scott: Everyone is playing games with that build.

536
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:20,246
Rym: Yep.

537
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:25,010
Scott: Ah And they could undo their patch, but they don't seem to want to do that either.

538
00:38:25,351 --> 00:38:29,070
Scott: They need this unnamed anti-cheat software to update itself.

539
00:38:29,692 --> 00:38:35,610
Scott: And I guess they don't want to go without that patch and the cheating people don't want to make that patch.

540
00:38:36,193 --> 00:38:42,859
Scott: So the windows 10 is like all held up by this By this one some anti-cheat software somewhere.

541
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:45,547
Scott: Yeah, I presume, you know, maybe it's valve steam vac.

542
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:46,510
Scott: I don't know it could be anything.

543
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:47,878
Rym: Yeah, I don't know which one it is.

544
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:49,710
Rym: I don't know a lot of that guy just saw it.

545
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:55,588
Scott: It's like some other company is holding up windows Unless Microsoft undoes its patch and they don't seem like they want to.

546
00:38:55,689 --> 00:39:06,867
Rym: yep I guess their anti-cheat software is difficult to do because the problem is that people are running third-party software that somehow fucks with software that is itself already verified.

547
00:39:07,248 --> 00:39:12,928
Rym: all the I all the Obvious ideas you can think of to solve this problem are already being done and aren't enough.

548
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:15,947
Scott: like no It's a. have your entire game server side the end.

549
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:17,973
Scott: That's all you gotta do.

550
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:24,142
Scott: if somebody does some sort of cheating that only manipulates like the inputs good for you You win.

551
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,754
Rym: yeah The thing is there.

552
00:39:25,774 --> 00:39:26,536
Rym: we are cheating.

553
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:28,904
Scott: software looks at the screen and then moves the map.

554
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:34,281
Scott: you looks at the frame buffer Five uses computer imaging to find targets and then moves the mouse.

555
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:36,427
Rym: I want to see cheating software.

556
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:37,250
Rym: You're allowed to do that.

557
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:47,410
Rym: I want to see cheating software that looks at your screen and moves the mouse but also Searches twitch and YouTube to try to find other people who happen to be streaming the game you're in and incorporates that data.

558
00:39:47,773 --> 00:39:49,405
Scott: I mean, that's just automated stream sniping.

559
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:59,907
Scott: Yeah, there's No way to detect or stop that right but as long as you know You're not like messing with the game itself as long as you're cheating on the the input output side.

560
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:00,890
Scott: That's okay.

561
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:06,365
Scott: Yeah, I'm okay with that But just keep the entire game server side that we know could cheat unless the hacker server wish they can.

562
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:09,721
Rym: so really tiny news Someone pointed out.

563
00:40:09,802 --> 00:40:13,629
Rym: I think this was from some RIAA report.

564
00:40:14,493 --> 00:40:24,844
Rym: More people bought physical CDs and vinyl then bought iTunes songs last year, which duh I think that was I assume is still buying CDs and vinyl right?

565
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:26,990
Scott: Well, I guess old people are buying CDs.

566
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,706
Scott: yeah, right because they just won't go digital.

567
00:40:29,746 --> 00:40:38,678
Scott: and then All kinds of people are buying vinyl because they're not buying the music that like they're not buying the vinyl Buying it to collect the vinyl.

568
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:43,683
Scott: a lot of you and some people for some reason have this You know idea that vinyl is better and they're wrong.

569
00:40:43,784 --> 00:40:44,730
Rym: Yeah, absolutely wrong.

570
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:48,850
Scott: Some people admit the vinyls worse, but they have a nostalgic thing for and do it.

571
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:49,778
Scott: Anyway, fine.

572
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:50,524
Rym: All right.

573
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:51,130
Rym: I like I can.

574
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:52,650
Scott: That's your thing.

575
00:40:52,891 --> 00:40:53,373
Rym: I can see.

576
00:40:53,413 --> 00:40:57,690
Rym: like I do enjoy the ritual of putting a vinyl record on a turntable because I remember doing that.

577
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,502
Scott: People buy vinyl cuz they're a DJ and they use two turntables and a microphone.

578
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:03,367
Rym: Yeah, maybe they use that digital vinyl.

579
00:41:03,688 --> 00:41:04,210
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

580
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:08,369
Scott: But who the hell would buy an mp3 when you see Apple music Spotify?

581
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:13,359
Scott: Yep I stream music because if you're already getting an mp3 Why not use some higher up?

582
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:19,722
Rym: because the vast majority of people who listen to music Don't care about music enough to buy every song they care about.

583
00:41:20,003 --> 00:41:22,290
Rym: they're gonna just stream the music that's popular.

584
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,981
Scott: That's the only time I ever buy an mp3.

585
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:34,749
Scott: in these days is when there's a super Not, you know indie band such that I could not pirate their mp3 on Pirate Bay because they're too small.

586
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:43,515
Scott: They're also not on Spotify or Apple or Apple music or Google Play or whatever because they're for whatever reason But they're on like bandcamp.

587
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:49,473
Scott: pretty much bandcamp is the only site I buy music from yep these days and I will go I'll Say oh your albums there.

588
00:41:49,553 --> 00:41:53,022
Scott: Okay, here's $2 or I already kick-started you.

589
00:41:53,323 --> 00:42:03,370
Rym: Give me that mp3s for free and then or else I I have individually bought wave and flak files from individual artists who sold them directly from their websites.

590
00:42:03,992 --> 00:42:04,674
Scott: That's basically a bank.

591
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:06,200
Rym: Yeah, but there's just like one.

592
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:07,685
Rym: It's not even a bandcamp.

593
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:17,250
Rym: It's just like here's my website So rare that's like yeah twice a year Maybe but even then that music was also on a shocking number of streaming services.

594
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,027
Scott: It is shocking how much Spotify is really like got everything.

595
00:42:21,067 --> 00:42:34,330
Rym: There's not much That's not there but I think that the end the world is moving toward on demand streaming for music and a small number of people who care a Lot about music itself are going to do things like collect vinyl.

596
00:42:35,194 --> 00:42:41,239
Rym: I feel like there should be market in the future of everything streams But you can pay to get a flak file.

597
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,390
Rym: That's like mastered or I think audio file nonsense.

598
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,019
Rym: Multitrack split out, you know what?

599
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:47,741
Rym: I really like to see.

600
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:56,590
Rym: you could buy an album for like 40 bucks But it comes with all the tracks like the actual mastering data from the studio.

601
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,663
Scott: No one's gonna give you for remixes and it comes no as giving you that.

602
00:42:59,723 --> 00:43:01,270
Rym: and it comes with a license to remix.

603
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,437
Scott: No one's giving you that.

604
00:43:02,518 --> 00:43:03,504
Rym: I'm saying that's not for 40 bucks.

605
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:05,676
Rym: For 400 bucks.

606
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:09,010
Scott: master license cost way more than that depends on what you're doing with it.

607
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:15,881
Scott: anyway, the point is what I would like to see is You know, like I just said Spotify for example has fucking everything almost.

608
00:43:15,901 --> 00:43:17,766
Scott: Yeah, but there are things it doesn't have.

609
00:43:18,147 --> 00:43:19,573
Scott: it's not a hundred percent It's just.

610
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:21,707
Scott: it's really hard to find something doesn't have all right.

611
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:28,790
Scott: And what they should do is they just be like, all right If I search for something on Spotify and it's not on there and even the Beatles are on there now.

612
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,469
Scott: Okay, so it's like it's like come on you searches on and it's not on there.

613
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:36,947
Scott: That's when it should say all right look This album is not here.

614
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:40,220
Scott: Give us five dollars and you will.

615
00:43:40,742 --> 00:43:42,288
Scott: you don't bother downloading mp3s.

616
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:46,865
Scott: You just give us five dollars right now and then you will work it out.

617
00:43:46,886 --> 00:43:48,030
Scott: this specific artist.

618
00:43:48,131 --> 00:43:49,942
Scott: Well, you know who doesn't want to be on Spotify.

619
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:51,330
Rym: They'll get four dollars, right?

620
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:55,050
Scott: We'll give them the money and then you can have that on Spotify, right?

621
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:58,210
Scott: Well, so they unlock the streaming of it for you forever.

622
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:05,134
Scott: Yep, right by paying this money and maybe even give you the mp3s if you want them also sure go ahead and download them You don't have to.

623
00:44:05,154 --> 00:44:05,918
Scott: it's like do you?

624
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:12,585
Rym: I used to collect music because you know The world was different and I have a directory that I've copied from computer to computer to computer forever.

625
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:15,970
Scott: That's a lot of mp3s I have that I have that directory also.

626
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:22,430
Rym: I've added maybe a hundred mp3s to that directory in the last five years like nothing to it.

627
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,823
Scott: so actually now would be you know, it's like I could go back and organize.

628
00:44:25,923 --> 00:44:25,984
Scott: it.

629
00:44:26,024 --> 00:44:30,340
Scott: now would be a good time because Yeah, it's so, you know, it's not changing.

630
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,050
Scott: So it's not hard to you know, once I organize it, I'll be done forever.

631
00:44:33,492 --> 00:44:36,790
Scott: Yeah, and I can also delete a lot of things from it that are on spot.

632
00:44:36,872 --> 00:44:39,653
Rym: Yeah like I have a lot of my mp3s are.

633
00:44:39,673 --> 00:44:50,229
Rym: I have every OC remix because I downloaded a package of all of them from OC remixes in like Only need to get the music from there that I can't get anywhere else.

634
00:44:50,812 --> 00:44:53,726
Scott: If there's a song in there that I can get easily from another source.

635
00:44:53,867 --> 00:44:56,027
Rym: I don't need it all right, let's burn through a few of these.

636
00:44:56,047 --> 00:45:00,120
Rym: so Real technology news Linux 5 came out.

637
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,163
Scott: whatever they did.

638
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,687
Scott: The numbers now are arbitrary.

639
00:45:02,748 --> 00:45:04,012
Rym: literally doesn't matter They're not.

640
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:07,830
Scott: they're no longer changing the number in relation to a significant software change.

641
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:11,447
Scott: Here's the thing most of arbitrarily making the number go up when they feel like it.

642
00:45:11,648 --> 00:45:24,869
Rym: nerds Like us would care about Linux kernels back when Linux was used on the desktop and it was like I need the kernel to support My weird bullshit hardware like there was a reason like my Wi-Fi won't work yet stuff like that.

643
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:38,157
Rym: Nowadays, it's just server operating system software and If you're the person who manages servers, just keep your stuff reasonably up-to-date And that's it very rarely.

644
00:45:38,218 --> 00:45:41,688
Rym: Is there a feature coming in the kernel that you need in production today?

645
00:45:41,768 --> 00:45:42,350
Rym: for a reason?

646
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:43,696
Rym: Mm-hmm, like DRB.

647
00:45:43,756 --> 00:45:44,480
Rym: D is already there.

648
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:53,408
Rym: like stuffs already there Linux kernel releases are about as newsworthy even to nerds as like what's in the next Windows patch.

649
00:45:53,769 --> 00:45:58,530
Rym: Yep Uh, here's an interesting tech news that none of you will care about.

650
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:05,341
Rym: w3c approved a Standard for password free logins on websites like a universal standard.

651
00:46:05,421 --> 00:46:10,430
Scott: all your browsers already have this but they're not using it because Websites aren't using it properly.

652
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:16,712
Rym: Yep, or maybe in your phone like you want to you want to have a standard where I could say log into website X with My thumbprint.

653
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:24,357
Rym: so there is an official standard kind of like the standard that we use with our TOTP for two-factor and our Fido keys.

654
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:42,149
Rym: This is in that same suite to allow you to use things like Fido keys and Biometrics or whatever you want to use for password direct passwordless authentication to websites instead of just relying on your browser Saving the password in a store to paste into a form.

655
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:57,299
Rym: It's good news and only people who held the only people who will care about the fact that the w3c approved This are the people who work in companies and are implementing this for websites and for authentication systems Like nerds won't care.

656
00:46:57,319 --> 00:46:58,789
Rym: It'll just start working on your phones.

657
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:02,259
Rym: I think we can stop there.

658
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,545
Rym: We've gone on for a long time.

659
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:04,228
Scott: Okay, good.

660
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:04,570
Scott: I'm hungry.

661
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:06,656
Rym: Yeah, let's just stop cuz I'm also hungry.

662
00:47:06,676 --> 00:47:09,685
Rym: I don't use before is not that interesting to talk about yet?

663
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,130
Rym: foldable phones.

664
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:14,741
Rym: Yeah, that's all I got.

665
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:15,685
Rym: we're gonna eat some food.

666
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:16,467
Rym: Oh one last news.

667
00:47:16,487 --> 00:47:17,169
Rym: this one's really funny.

668
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,929
Rym: Apple Has Apple stores all over the world?

669
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:35,869
Rym: They're a part apparently closing two of their stores in, Texas Because those are the only two stores they have in a particular judicial district the Eastern District of Texas Which for various reasons is where?

670
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:43,926
Rym: Almost every patent troll in the world files their lawsuit to try to extort money out of tech companies in the u.s.

671
00:47:43,966 --> 00:47:46,598
Scott: Right because there's some Corrupt judges there.

672
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,180
Scott: Yep.

673
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:55,145
Rym: There's a lot of reasons Updated February 22nd as this news a little old Apple has confirmed.

674
00:47:55,165 --> 00:48:00,710
Rym: They will be closing the stores And they're relocating the employees like they're helping everybody out.

675
00:48:01,071 --> 00:48:09,603
Rym: So basically Apple saying if we close these two Apple stores And we don't do any business in this Eastern District of Texas clearly won't do.

676
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:13,594
Scott: then you cannot get you know Patent suits for us.

677
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:16,163
Scott: do it in that district because we're not doing business in that district.

678
00:48:16,544 --> 00:48:27,309
Rym: and it's interesting because I suspect a lot Of these patent troll cases could not easily get past the first round if they file in any other district in America Yep, so we'll see how this plays out.

679
00:48:27,631 --> 00:48:29,055
Rym: This is the kind of thing that

680
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:32,185
Scott: they are putting one Apple store basically right across the board yep,

681
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:55,628
Rym: so on one hand I don't think gigantic multi-billion dollar corporations should be able to Skirt the judicial system by closing a star, but on the other hand Apple is generally not in the wrong in these patent troll lawsuits and the judicial system and Congress have failed to address this fundamental problem in copyright and patent law.

682
00:48:55,729 --> 00:49:11,361
Scott: well I think part of the problem is not just you know the lack of the the Congress's ability to fix the patent laws yeah, there's no more patent trolls, but also this question of like Districts and jurisdiction don't work in the modern world when it's like.

683
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:18,570
Scott: it's like there needs to just be sort of like this Federal like general federal court court of the internet right where it's like.

684
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,979
Scott: It's like Apple is a countrywide deal.

685
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,870
Scott: if you sue them you shouldn't be able to like pick a spot.

686
00:49:24,171 --> 00:49:27,230
Scott: So here is the old side about the geography have to do with it, right?

687
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,001
Scott: It's like if Apple fucks up everyone's iPhone battery.

688
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:32,070
Scott: They fucked up everyone's iPhone battery.

689
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:41,910
Scott: There should be an everything federal court district for when there are lawsuits involving Big things that aren't actually G don't matter geographically, right?

690
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,876
Rym: It's the sideshow Bob conundrum.

691
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:47,890
Scott: the old episode is a federal crime in Eastern, Texas.

692
00:49:48,473 --> 00:49:51,450
Scott: Then it makes sense to go to the federal court in Eastern, Texas.

693
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:58,479
Scott: But if someone commits a federal crime or some sort of you know isn't necessarily a crime But you know the reason to sue them.

694
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:01,173
Scott: under a federal statute I guess whatever.

695
00:50:01,193 --> 00:50:04,785
Scott: it is not a lawyer that doesn't have any geography related to it.

696
00:50:04,865 --> 00:50:06,230
Scott: Why should you have to pick a geography?

697
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:13,250
Rym: It comes down to where the crime occurred and the question of where the crime occurred is really complicated in the modern world.

698
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,962
Scott: I want to make some sort of central federal thing.

699
00:50:15,982 --> 00:50:17,790
Scott: then the rule should be all right.

700
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,716
Scott: You're a nationwide international company.

701
00:50:19,756 --> 00:50:23,127
Scott: the lawsuit involving you someone's suing you on for on federal.

702
00:50:23,448 --> 00:50:24,130
Scott: You know matters.

703
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:26,517
Scott: We pick a random federal court.

704
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:27,460
Scott: Yeah, we don't.

705
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,644
Scott: you don't get to pick which one.

706
00:50:28,684 --> 00:50:29,186
Scott: it's random.

707
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:35,593
Scott: because so remember Sideshow Bob was gonna kill bar and distribute the workload across all the different federal Districts.

708
00:50:35,794 --> 00:50:46,882
Rym: sideshow Bob was gonna go to that spot where five states meet Hold a gun stand in one state hold a gun over the border in the second state to shoot Bart Who's standing in a third state and then Bart's body would fall in the fourth state.

709
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:49,210
Rym: like a plan like that to confuse?

710
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:52,030
Rym: The jurisdiction so much that he couldn't be prosecuted.

711
00:50:53,612 --> 00:50:56,970
Rym: The internet actually has a problem like that times a hundred.

712
00:50:57,772 --> 00:51:14,930
Rym: Where did the crime occur when a phone made by a global international company uses software developed by someone in a third-party country that violates Ostensibly a patent filed by a patent troll that was formed in Texas specifically to extort money out of the first company, right?

713
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,030
Scott: So why does Eastern Texas?

714
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,132
Rym: Yep All right.

715
00:51:19,252 --> 00:51:20,596
Rym: That was our tech news roundup.

716
00:51:20,636 --> 00:51:24,326
Rym: We will see you again in one year for the next GeekNights.

717
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:25,850
Rym: tech news around.

718
00:51:31,143 --> 00:51:33,700
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

719
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,480
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

720
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:40,768
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

721
