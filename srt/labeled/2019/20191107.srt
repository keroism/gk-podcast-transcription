Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:27,609
Rym: You can tell when we're really hitting the bottom of the barrel for like idea for a good show.

6
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,431
Rym: I Mean.

7
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:31,400
Scott: I thought of the show cuz I I was.

8
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:37,810
Scott: we were discussing it while I was out eating lunch And I saw I was just looking around like is there anything I see with my eyes?

9
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:40,075
Rym: I've done the same thing.

10
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:40,859
Rym: I sit at my desk.

11
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:41,863
Rym: Let's do a show on.

12
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:49,628
Rym: I look and I'm like Microphones, and then we did a show on microphones like wallets cuz I'm looking at a wallet right now.

13
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:51,454
Rym: Mm-hmm that's.

14
00:00:51,655 --> 00:00:55,207
Rym: uh that's what happens when you Simpsons yourselves and do a podcast for 14 plus years.

15
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:09,498
Rym: So actually if you weren't aware on October 31st, which was literally one week ago today We didn't do a show because it wasn't scheduled to be a show but that was The anniversary of GeekNights.

16
00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:10,321
Rym: GeekNights started.

17
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:12,809
Rym: the first episode went live on October 31st.

18
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:18,608
Rym: That was a long goddamn time ago.

19
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:27,990
Rym: We have done a lot of episodes of GeekNights And you should be thankful that all of them all like 2000 or whatever of them are just on YouTube for free or YouTube.

20
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:32,029
Rym: They're all just on the internet for free hosted in a variety of places.

21
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:38,612
Rym: But I'll warn you not really met a moment cuz I'll talk about where I'm going, but it's kind of as a. you know It's Thursday.

22
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:39,275
Rym: It's the lounge.

23
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:41,043
Rym: We can talk about whatever in the first part of the show.

24
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:49,590
Rym: I'm uh When I had my old job I traveled a lot and a lot of times you can actually get disrupted for a week or three because I'd like go live in Istanbul for a while or something.

25
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:52,829
Rym: But that stopped for a while because I have a new job or work somewhere different.

26
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:56,610
Rym: But now for various reasons, I'm traveling again for this job.

27
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:10,769
Rym: So for the next two weeks, I will be in Asia and over the course of two weeks I'm gonna go to Manila Singapore Bangkok Melbourne Sydney and then back home and it's gonna be a pretty grueling trip.

28
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,318
Rym: So no GeekNights the next two weeks.

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,770
Scott: if I have good for me I can do other shit.

30
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:18,439
Rym: Yeah, work on some kind of.

31
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:19,485
Rym: we got a lot of GeekNights stuff.

32
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:24,725
Rym: We got to work on Yep, a lot of cons coming up a lot of biz, but I'll try to post some pictures.

33
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,190
Rym: watch follow me on social media.

34
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:35,715
Rym: Maybe I'll do a few live streams on the patreon like from these cities because I've I've never been to Bangkok or Manila before So I'm actually excited about that.

35
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:39,810
Rym: See I'm stuck in Singapore over the weekend, but I've been to Singapore a lot.

36
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:40,908
Rym: So, I don't know what I'll do.

37
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:44,246
Rym: I might just go to Universal Studios or something cuz like.

38
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:44,989
Rym: what else am I gonna do?

39
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,910
Rym: Hmm, I spent a lot of time in Singapore.

40
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,664
Rym: Like I don't think there's anything I need to see that I haven't seen.

41
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:53,314
Rym: maybe I'll go mountain biking But I don't know.

42
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:57,881
Rym: it's gonna be like a hundred degrees so that might be a little too hot even for me to go mountain biking.

43
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:03,959
Rym: uh the other things going on in my life is uh My mattress is.

44
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:13,129
Rym: I actually tried to figure out how old my mattress is my the mattress I sleep on this queen-size mattress with a pillow top is At least 15 years old.

45
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,577
Scott: Yeah, I think you know you had one.

46
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,470
Scott: you had the bed the bed frame you had before our at college.

47
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,740
Scott: Yep, right, but I do think you replaced the mattress at one point.

48
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:24,770
Rym: I've replaced the mattress when I went to college.

49
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:27,665
Rym: Okay, so the mattress was new when I went to college.

50
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,032
Rym: Okay, so 2000 right.

51
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:35,036
Scott: I mean I bought so it's 19 years old or Anyone to college.

52
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:38,109
Scott: then I replaced it when I moved to New York ten years ago.

53
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:42,864
Scott: But then I just moved and I just threw the whole bed out.

54
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:44,790
Scott: I guess just Amanda's bed was way new.

55
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,780
Scott: So just use that one that one's like less than a year old.

56
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:49,667
Rym: maybe looks like a pretty nice bed.

57
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:50,570
Scott: Yeah, it's fun.

58
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,189
Scott: It's like it's some kind of mattress from one of those.

59
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:54,979
Scott: It's not the you know the.

60
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:56,769
Scott: it's from one of those websites where it's.

61
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:58,641
Scott: yeah You know we send you a mattress.

62
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:59,949
Scott: you send it back if you don't like it.

63
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:07,518
Rym: I think we talked about occasionally on gig notes of the mattress industry for a long time was kind of messed up and Like mattress technology kind of sucked.

64
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:10,950
Rym: and now a bunch of internet people are disrupting it with varying degrees of success.

65
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:14,910
Rym: There's a lot of these companies that like mail you a mattress that like inflates itself.

66
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:23,130
Rym: So, uh, because we live in New York There's actually a place we went to where they have like every mattress that all the different online places sell.

67
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:25,290
Scott: Yeah, that's like it's really in New York City.

68
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:26,259
Scott: It's weird like you.

69
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:33,550
Scott: on the one hand You have so much ability to get things delivered and order things online from pretty much anywhere right and get anything.

70
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:42,517
Scott: but They also have in Manhattan these places that are usually online only businesses Right for like the rest of the world.

71
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:45,130
Scott: It's like, you know, you could never go to a Newegg store.

72
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:45,976
Scott: Yeah, right.

73
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:47,630
Scott: It's like there's no Newegg store, right?

74
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,539
Scott: Yeah, I guess there's no Newegg store anywhere that I know of.

75
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,288
Scott: there might be one somewhere but not that I know of.

76
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:58,850
Scott: but for other places like there was There was like a clothing store and they only sold clothes online and that was it right?

77
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,170
Scott: It's like well, there's a crazy thing in my head, but in Manhattan, they have us does like their only store.

78
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,236
Rym: There's a store in Manhattan.

79
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:06,729
Rym: That is an Amazon store that weirdly enough sells books.

80
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:10,320
Scott: Yeah, well it sells only things that are rated four stars and up.

81
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,550
Scott: yeah, right I've been at store was near my previous work.

82
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,520
Rym: Look, yeah, I was hanging out there cuz it was cold.

83
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,002
Rym: I was waiting for.

84
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:21,201
Scott: so it's like there's so many stores Especially in Manhattan that are like the only.

85
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:27,950
Scott: they're like showrooms for a web only business And it's literally the only showroom in the whole world for that web.

86
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:33,976
Rym: Well, which I think is a trend that's going to increase over time because many things I don't need to try it in person Like my laptop.

87
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:35,590
Rym: I can do my research just buy a laptop.

88
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:42,390
Scott: Well, I think the thing is is that there's so much tourists and shopping tourists in Manhattan that they're not only are the people who?

89
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,490
Scott: Live here going to occasionally think that that's convenient Right to be able to go try a product in person before ordering online.

90
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,869
Scott: It's out of doing the whole by return by return.

91
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:57,950
Scott: You don't even know about online business right but tourists come through they see those places they go in and they become a customer.

92
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:03,410
Scott: Or I think a lot of tourists, you know are a customer and then they come and they see a store.

93
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,258
Scott: It's like oh my god a store of that thing.

94
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,760
Rym: Holy I remember we went to Seattle and then we were like Oh shit a Timbuktu store now.

95
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,187
Scott: We've got multiple times

96
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:11,448
Rym: a bunch

97
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:11,609
Scott: here

98
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:24,670
Rym: but I think part of it too is just that if you put a store like that cuz there's this mattress thing exists here and Like two other places and that's it because there's just so many people in New York that like it makes sense.

99
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:32,089
Rym: So we went and it was super chill and there's a lot of people just coming in Chumming all these mattresses and I tried a whole bunch of these mattresses and they're all really good.

100
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:32,832
Rym: Like.

101
00:06:33,736 --> 00:06:37,009
Rym: the only problem is the more a lot of people sell lemon mattresses though.

102
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:40,802
Rym: One thing I noticed the I didn't look at product.

103
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:43,954
Rym: we laid on them all and then we went back to see what they were And how much they cost.

104
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,365
Rym: the more expensive ones were just better.

105
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:47,310
Rym: like they felt better.

106
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,097
Rym: They were more comfortable.

107
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,450
Rym: like everything about them was just better.

108
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:50,829
Scott: I mean, you know, that's how they do.

109
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:51,693
Rym: So I went.

110
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:55,248
Rym: we went with the Spartan hybrid because it was called Spartan.

111
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:56,741
Rym: now It had a better.

112
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:57,590
Rym: like it felt better.

113
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,074
Rym: It's just way more comfortable and I like a way soft bed and this one is way soft Like a not-so-soft.

114
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:05,963
Rym: Yeah, you Scott basically likes to sleep, but I can't.

115
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:09,918
Scott: the thing is even though I like a rock Yeah, I can sleep on anything.

116
00:07:09,938 --> 00:07:11,585
Scott: So it's like whatever I did.

117
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:12,932
Scott: I just sleep on the bed we got.

118
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:19,462
Rym: I think what really sealed the deal was we went to that wedding upstate and we stayed in a hotel that had a Particularly good bed and laying in that bed.

119
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:24,993
Rym: We both were just like Like.

120
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:26,098
Rym: this bed is comfortable.

121
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:27,384
Rym: why isn't our bed this comfortable?

122
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:27,926
Rym: what the fuck?

123
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:37,406
Rym: Yeah So So, uh, we actually did a show on beds already back in 2017, so I'll link to that.

124
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:38,730
Rym: there is some news.

125
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:43,750
Rym: So if you have our friends the other night, we're just like whoa weird thing happened.

126
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:52,937
Rym: I got a bunch of texts from like February And apparently that was a thing across the entire country Seems to have mostly affected the US.

127
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:56,970
Rym: like I can't find instances of this happening except for US carriers.

128
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:11,315
Rym: But basically something happened and a whole bunch of text messages that were sent on like specific days around Valentine's Day this year either never got delivered when they were sent and Suddenly got delivered just now

129
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:12,358
Scott: or were

130
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:16,130
Rym: delivered back then and then just got redelivered just now

131
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:17,774
Scott: Like yesterday.

132
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:27,568
Rym: Yeah, like yesterday like a whole bunch of people just got text which led some interesting situations Like family member is dead and you get a text from them like stuff like that happens.

133
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:33,227
Rym: Yep There is no clear explanation of exactly what happened yet.

134
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:47,547
Rym: We can speculate Reporters like reaching out to these companies But and we're not gonna go deep into this because this is way more a Monday topic than a Thursday topic Like I don't explain to you SMS works But here's the TL DL version or TL DW version or TLDR crap.

135
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:50,498
Rym: SMS should be banned.

136
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:53,830
Rym: SMS is shit garbage technology that should not exist.

137
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:56,377
Scott: It is a lot of the world depends on it.

138
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:06,084
Rym: Uh, yeah, but in like in the US it should be banned or Phones should be able to send messages to phone numbers using modern technology.

139
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:06,846
Scott: Well, they should do.

140
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:07,328
Scott: is they should?

141
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:13,769
Scott: you know They should force, you know, it's like we have these other standards for sending messages like iMessage or whatever.

142
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:23,030
Scott: When Apple came out with iMessage written in the Monday Territory They claimed they claimed go back and watch the first the keynote where they announced iMessage.

143
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:25,204
Scott: I can't tell you what year it was right.

144
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:30,330
Scott: they claimed That iMessage and FaceTime we're gonna be like open standards.

145
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:40,322
Scott: They said, you know giving me the impression and like oh I'll be able to write my own Software my own iMessage client like you'll be able to use.

146
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:50,766
Scott: I don't know what they call these days pigeon like the old Right, or I miss those days or like that, you know, remember our Laconica servers Make Android apps that let you iMessage people right.

147
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:52,750
Scott: they gave that impression that it would be open.

148
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:55,039
Scott: But no, it's closed.

149
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,770
Scott: only people with iPhones can FaceTime and iMessage people.

150
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,486
Scott: It's even at the point where like if you're at Rym doesn't have an iPhone's.

151
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:02,229
Scott: doesn't realize this?

152
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:10,289
Scott: When you when you text people on an iPhone if you text someone who is not an iPhone person All your the text bubbles are green.

153
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,493
Scott: Yeah And that lets you.

154
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:18,095
Scott: even if you make a big group chat if everyone in the group chat has an iPhone except one person All the bubbles are green.

155
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:21,227
Scott: It uses regular old SMS and your features are limited.

156
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:22,030
Scott: You can't do too much.

157
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,869
Scott: You know, we send text messages and the basic standard Unicode emojis, and that's it.

158
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,781
Scott: So what happens is like I've heard stories of my kids at school.

159
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:36,479
Scott: They got an Android phone all their friends got iPhone and They'll be like because they're in the group chat.

160
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:37,282
Scott: right it?

161
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:39,170
Scott: all the other kids are like fuck.

162
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,160
Scott: I can't do all the cool.

163
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,969
Scott: I message stuff like Right, you know like animojis and all the cool stuff.

164
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:47,649
Scott: So they'll just make another group chat without that person once they figure out who it is.

165
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:53,946
Scott: Yeah Android phone just so that they can use iMessage because Apple didn't go through with their promise to make it open.

166
00:10:54,327 --> 00:11:22,330
Rym: Yep, but SMS like text messaging is basically using like Extra space on legacy Carrier technology like it's almost like trying like using power lines to transmit data like it's that level of ridiculous nonsense and I think on our next Monday show, we'll talk about this a little more detail because basically, the reason this happened is that SMS is Way bad and needs to be destroyed and replaced by some standard that works with modern technology.

167
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:29,214
Scott: I feel like they should just make like SMS - yeah We don't have problems making things like Wi-Fi - and you know Genes.

168
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:35,748
Scott: replacing 4g with 5g I don't replacing SMS with SMS - will not be any more difficult than replacing 4g with 5g.

169
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:37,677
Scott: And yeah, you basically had got.

170
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:42,302
Scott: you're gonna have phones for a while to do both and then eventually Not have phones to do the old one.

171
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:43,350
Rym: I mean I use signals.

172
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:47,406
Rym: So if you text me and you also have signal it'll just use signal instead of texting.

173
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:47,748
Rym: Mmm.

174
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:50,302
Scott: Anyway, that's I message works.

175
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:53,419
Rym: Yeah, pretty much Some other news.

176
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:54,630
Rym: we talked about how the election happened.

177
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,451
Rym: We got the results and it's pretty important what's going on in the u.s Cuz.

178
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:02,085
Rym: this was a really high turnout for an off-year election.

179
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,490
Scott: mad people vote in the man.

180
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:08,128
Rym: Yeah, obviously there were some returns of like 20-something percent of people voted someone's.

181
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:10,961
Scott: that's low But it's a high compared to what we usually get.

182
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:12,710
Rym: Yep, and for an off-year election.

183
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,690
Rym: That's like triple what we usually get like people don't fucking vote in these elections.

184
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,442
Rym: No but the biggest thing that happened was one of our states.

185
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:23,676
Rym: Virginia has always been a problem and It went completely Democrat.

186
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:28,510
Rym: It's both chambers of its of its equivalent of Congress like it's legislature.

187
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:29,989
Rym: Yes, it's how you're looking for.

188
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:32,290
Rym: No, cuz it's like I don't think they have a house in the Senate.

189
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,177
Rym: They have like a Senate and a something else.

190
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:35,341
Scott: It's a legislative body.

191
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:39,802
Rym: Yeah as opposed to an executive body Yes, but also their executive.

192
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:41,210
Rym: when blue basically everything went blue.

193
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:41,853
Rym: It's a blue state.

194
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:42,316
Scott: love.

195
00:12:42,336 --> 00:12:46,609
Scott: Virginia already had a Democratic governor, Kentucky gained Which is also crazy.

196
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:53,049
Rym: But this means something crazy could happen in the US and it sounds so crackpot Like you wouldn't believe it.

197
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,544
Rym: But it's actually like real to the point that real news is talking about it.

198
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:08,450
Rym: back in the 40s And I'm not gonna go deep into this there was a thing in the US that was the Equal Rights Amendment like the 1940s and it basically just says men and women should be equal under the eyes of the law.

199
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:10,201
Rym: Like that's basically it.

200
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:10,865
Rym: it was an amendment.

201
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:11,550
Scott: It's not very long.

202
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:16,469
Rym: Yeah, it's an amendment to the Constitution saying you can't discriminate against men and women like.

203
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,757
Scott: well He can't discriminate based on sex.

204
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,522
Rym: yes, it's the language is?

205
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:24,378
Rym: I mean this was like conceived in the 40s like it's not.

206
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:28,574
Rym: it could be done a little better and Basically, it never it did.

207
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:34,414
Rym: all this shit happened and it never actually got ratified as an amendment because a lot of American states are Stupid.

208
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:39,948
Rym: but a whole bunch of states ratified this amendment and there's complicated rules about what that means.

209
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,875
Rym: but It just so happens.

210
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:47,569
Rym: Virginia is one of the few states that didn't ratify it and still.

211
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:53,103
Scott: well we need one more state to ratify it and Most of the states that haven't never will like.

212
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,554
Scott: you're not gonna see Alabama What's even funnier.

213
00:13:55,654 --> 00:14:00,930
Scott: but Virginia tried just this year earlier this year to ratify it and failed by one vote.

214
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:11,430
Scott: And now the people who are in the legislative body of Virginia who are the people who would be voting to ratify it are now Completely different people very much more in favor of it and they could just try it again.

215
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,496
Rym: But it's even crazier.

216
00:14:12,556 --> 00:14:19,084
Rym: a whole bunch of states that ratified it a long time ago Since then turned Republican and tried to own ratify.

217
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:26,730
Rym: they voted to say fuck it No, we don't want this amendment, but because this is constitutional law you can't do the head can't undo?

218
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:31,483
Scott: Yeah, so it's like it's like sign a contract say I want to unsign.

219
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:32,526
Rym: Yep, right?

220
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:36,064
Scott: It's like oh wait Let me take my name off that Declaration of Independence.

221
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:38,235
Scott: No, so You're in.

222
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:54,541
Rym: you can read about this go out, but basically Some crazy constitutional shit that isn't related to our traitorous criminal of a president might go down like pretty quickly because People actually begin their you know their session.

223
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:58,795
Rym: I want to say in January, but I don't know if Virginia does something I don't know what the fuck Virginia does.

224
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:03,169
Scott: Yeah, Virginia the place I go once a year only because of the magfest.

225
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:07,327
Scott: there I mean another I touch I touch the very edge of Virginia and then escape.

226
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:11,730
Scott: Yep Just like just to graze the side of it where a magfest is happening.

227
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:16,544
Rym: What I know about Virginia is that it is the it of the of the Virginias.

228
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:17,366
Rym: It's the better one.

229
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:32,753
Rym: Yeah But anyway, it's time for things of the day.

230
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:44,480
Rym: so, you know you got Video game consoles and old computers and electronics where if you just turn them on Some sort of splash screen or opening screen or startup sequence happens.

231
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:55,340
Scott: Well, I think the thing is is that you know people are used to PCs right and with a PC you if you turn it on with no disk, it doesn't do jack shit, right?

232
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,970
Rym: Well, but the thing is like BIOS would load.

233
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:58,392
Scott: Well, it would.

234
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:02,290
Scott: yeah, you could load your BIOS But you can't actually do anything with your BIOS.

235
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,560
Scott: Yeah, it's not computationally useful, right?

236
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:13,472
Scott: You would need to somehow Get a disk drive of some kind with a master boot record and some and put software there that the computer would load when it Turns on.

237
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:20,720
Scott: Yep But the thing is actually most computing devices are set to with some sort of firmware or some sort of included software.

238
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:21,940
Scott: So when you turn them on they do a thing.

239
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,416
Scott: I turn my Apple to GS on.

240
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:29,060
Scott: yeah If you don't put anything if you put something in the discs that the disk drives sure they'll boot that software.

241
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:33,600
Scott: But if you don't put anything in there, you get a useful terminal that you can do things.

242
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,186
Scott: Yeah You just need the manual to understand.

243
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:41,752
Rym: like a lot of old video game consoles and things which is boot something turn in a Commodore 64 you can do stuff but they'll be like yo put a disk in.

244
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:43,820
Rym: dude, right my boy, you know.

245
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:48,210
Scott: But you know video game consoles I think a lot of them.

246
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,744
Scott: you need to put a disk in an NES need to put a Cartridge in a game boy.

247
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:52,706
Scott: You need to put a cartridge in.

248
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:53,388
Rym: no independent.

249
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:58,923
Scott: I'm starting around, you know Xbox PlayStation times You know.

250
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:02,540
Scott: then you could like I think play stage you could turn it on and you would actually use like a menu.

251
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,290
Rym: It's like a menu.

252
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:03,939
Scott: you could do stuff.

253
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:16,520
Rym: But anyway Regardless of whether or not you had software ready to do something like a disc or cartridge in there Most of these devices had some sort of logo splash startup animation that would play with or without sound.

254
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,509
Scott: Yeah, like you're playing a cube did you do?

255
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:19,172
Rym: Yeah say it up.

256
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:20,458
Rym: Yeah say it up.

257
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,069
Scott: Well, it's Sega wouldn't do a Sega if you'd have a cartridge in it.

258
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:23,571
Scott: I don't think.

259
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:25,359
Rym: uh, I think the game gear did.

260
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,763
Rym: Don't remember I don't.

261
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:35,849
Rym: but anyway, this is an 18 minute and 7 second long YouTube video of Basically every game console that was ever released.

262
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,799
Rym: and if it had and whatever like startup thing happens.

263
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,625
Rym: Boo GameCube like.

264
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:43,755
Rym: I'm gonna read some of the random systems on the list the Vectrex.

265
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:46,262
Scott: Yeah, the Satellaview The mega CD one in Japan.

266
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:47,244
Rym: the mega CD 2 in Europe.

267
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:58,917
Rym: the Atari 37800. the Xbox 360 post-update HDMI and non HDMI.

268
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:02,836
Rym: the oh, yeah All the game of cube ones because there's a bunch of them.

269
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:06,031
Rym: Yep This video is just really fun to watch.

270
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,196
Scott: Mm-hmm.

271
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:07,940
Rym: Okay, so we got.

272
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:18,819
Scott: So, you know, there's something that like my whole life despite being alive for 37 years Right despite working for and at several businesses, right?

273
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:26,480
Rym: Yep it's like I never went to business school and I'm like one of the only people who does my kind of job and didn't go to business school.

274
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:37,656
Scott: I'm in a weird position right and it seems like there's like there's a lot of mystery about how to actually Run like the real nitty-gritty details of how to actually run a small business.

275
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:45,363
Scott: like I worked in a dry cleaner For example, there are only like the only other people there were like the two other people that work there and the person who owned It.

276
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:45,815
Scott: that was it.

277
00:18:46,302 --> 00:18:56,683
Scott: So it's like I'm pretty close to seeing how everything works there But I learned basically nothing if you gave me if you gave me a dry cleaning business I wouldn't know what the fuck to do it's.

278
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:57,651
Scott: I don't know how to do anything.

279
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:03,604
Rym: and I'm like I only know how to like work in giant companies at a big scale Like I can run.

280
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,740
Rym: I can do like a multi-million dollar like addressable market assessment and commercial model.

281
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:12,977
Rym: But if it's like a fifty thousand dollar your business, I literally don't know how to make that happen, right?

282
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:14,241
Rym: I don't understand it Right.

283
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:18,180
Scott: It's like and it's you know, you look online and there's a lot or you just look around the world.

284
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:28,139
Scott: There's a lot of scams going on like learn how to you know, make a bunch of money with you know, real estate everybody Right the shady biz going down.

285
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:33,700
Scott: Here's a YouTube channel of this dude, and he's mostly a real estate dude, right?

286
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:40,719
Scott: So his channel if you look at his older videos, he's in Ohio somewhere in a. you know Nick I think near Columbus ish like Southwest, Ohio.

287
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,989
Scott: Most of his older videos are like real estate related.

288
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:45,734
Scott: He's like check out this building.

289
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:47,840
Scott: I bought it's a complete dump.

290
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:54,467
Scott: It used to be like a train station in 18, you know, 60 or something like 1880 Civil war.

Rym: but that show would be all about things like postal banking and how I think the post office should also be an ISP and like all that kind of stuff.

441
00:28:52,578 --> 00:28:58,539
Rym: and That's not what we're gonna talk about today But we will do that at some point in the future because we're both very opinionated about it.

442
00:28:58,961 --> 00:29:04,539
Rym: We're gonna talk about actually like mailing shit and shipping so we can talk about UPS and FedEx and all those other biz.

443
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:08,600
Scott: Yeah, so the first thing is obviously you send a letter you get some stamp action.

444
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:15,766
Rym: Yeah, I'm we're old enough to remember when stamps had a variable cost that like every now and then it'd be like Oh stamps are gonna cost more.

445
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:19,338
Scott: Well, yeah when I was a kid right stamps were 20-something cents 25 cents.

446
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:20,194
Rym: I think.

447
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:24,937
Scott: yeah It kept going up a few cents every once in a while cuz I had to get a bunch of one cent.

448
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:29,220
Scott: fucking stand Like I were raising the stamp price by two cents.

449
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:40,580
Scott: So if you had like ten old stamps left You would go and buy ten like tiny stamps to add so that when you mailed something you would put two stamps on there your Old stamp and the few cents extra to get up to the new price.

450
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:44,173
Scott: And then when you ran out you would buy new stamps that were the new price.

451
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:46,080
Scott: and they kept doing this a bunch of times.

452
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:52,220
Scott: And eventually they invented the forever stamp, which you buy the stamp at the current price, whatever it happens to be.

453
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,047
Rym: I think it's 55 cents right now.

454
00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:54,489
Rym: Nothing.

455
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:56,678
Rym: I know I just looked it up cuz I don't know what stamps cause.

456
00:29:56,718 --> 00:30:01,753
Rym: yeah Like six years ago and I still have that book.

457
00:30:01,793 --> 00:30:02,356
Rym: cuz I failed.

458
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,320
Scott: like that's what I'm saying.

459
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,872
Scott: Is that six things in US stamps in the US?

460
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:07,400
Scott: They now just say forever on them.

461
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,480
Scott: You don't know what they cost when you unless you calculate it when you buy them.

462
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:16,692
Scott: And then even if the stamp price goes up like a zillion dollars You can still mail a letter with one stamp.

463
00:30:16,772 --> 00:30:18,018
Rym: This was not long ago.

464
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,945
Rym: This was 2007.

465
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,595
Scott: yep that they invented the forever stamp.

466
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:27,358
Rym: Yeah And I remember people were worried like what will people like buy a lot of stamps?

467
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:31,233
Rym: and like Arbitrage this and like cut revenue out of the postdoc dude.

468
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:32,940
Rym: It is not enough money to matter.

469
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:36,271
Rym: There's no way to make money hoarding stamps.

470
00:30:36,532 --> 00:30:36,753
Scott: Nope.

471
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:42,746
Scott: I also don't know why That They even have stamps.

472
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,180
Scott: it's like we could just tax people to make letter-sending free.

473
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:48,432
Rym: Yeah, I feel like unlike other government services.

474
00:30:48,452 --> 00:30:49,295
Rym: That should just be free.

475
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:50,620
Rym: Like I'm not worried about people over.

476
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:55,799
Scott: Feel like you should just be able to go to a post like a mailbox and dump a million letters.

477
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:57,220
Scott: now You want to know why not spam?

478
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,792
Rym: Imagine what spam would be like if that was literally just free right non-commercial mail.

479
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:02,895
Rym: It's not commercial.

480
00:31:03,015 --> 00:31:11,446
Rym: I'm just happy dude asking for a dollar If You can make that many letters Pretty easy to print things.

481
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:14,920
Rym: I it is remember when I printed some keep nice flowers a long time ago.

482
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:19,880
Rym: It is cheaper to print a hundred thousand of something then to print ten thousand of something.

483
00:31:20,101 --> 00:31:21,626
Scott: Anyway, they also got the postcard.

484
00:31:21,686 --> 00:31:22,550
Scott: you buy a postcard.

485
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:22,811
Scott: It has.

486
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:23,774
Scott: it's a piece of cardboard.

487
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:25,360
Scott: The stamp is already built into it.

488
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,295
Scott: Yeah, and then you just write on the outside, you know envelope know nothing.

489
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:29,180
Scott: Everyone can see what you wrote.

490
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:37,039
Rym: What's interesting is as a kid for than a regular letter though, like I used to mail letters and cards and things a lot Yep.

491
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:44,339
Rym: But I can't really remember why and I feel like I didn't want to and I was forced to like, uh You've got a mail Christmas cards to every relative every year.

492
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,439
Scott: I didn't do that.

493
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,920
Scott: But what you know, I would send letters and I was younger because pen pal in elementary school and he wrote back once.

494
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:53,108
Scott: These are days, you know before email.

495
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:55,577
Scott: Yeah, and you know phone calls were not.

496
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:01,314
Rym: you know Ten cents a minute was considered a really cheap long-distance.

497
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:06,089
Rym: long-distance phone calls were a thing Long-distance meant like the next town over right.

498
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:10,140
Scott: but even socially speaking phone calls were not always the best for every occasion.

499
00:32:10,522 --> 00:32:14,479
Rym: Well, cuz people weren't home people only had phones in their houses, right?

500
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:22,000
Scott: So yeah, you would sometimes send letters to people right or receive letters from people right and it's like even nowadays.

501
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:24,799
Scott: It's like if I'm you know text message someone I can send them like a link.

502
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:29,862
Scott: Right, even if I call you on the phone, I can't send you like Information.

503
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:33,640
Scott: Yeah, so I had to clip a newspaper article put it in an envelope and mail it to you.

504
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,375
Rym: No in the modern era like talk using a phone to call someone just like almost worthless.

505
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:42,812
Scott: Yeah You know, so yeah letters were a thing and there were.

506
00:32:42,853 --> 00:32:47,720
Scott: some times you would be in a situation Where you'd be away from technology like summer camp.

507
00:32:48,344 --> 00:32:50,417
Scott: That's when I would send the most letters because the only you couldn't.

508
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:52,865
Scott: oh, yeah There's no calling people.

509
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:57,345
Scott: when you're in summer camp you you would write letters to people and then they would send letter or you have A pen pal.

510
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:58,192
Rym: see Ben can.

511
00:32:58,212 --> 00:33:02,100
Scott: now I don't need pen pal I could just meet people from other countries on the internet, you know, right?

512
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,307
Rym: It's funny because by the time I went to band cam I just had a cell phone.

513
00:33:05,327 --> 00:33:08,444
Rym: so just brought the cell phone to band camp and if I've needed to call anyone I just called them.

514
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:10,777
Scott: Yeah, you know only rich people had him in those late 90s.

515
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:13,452
Rym: We were not rich late 90s.

516
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:14,640
Scott: only rich people had the cell phone.

517
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:16,971
Rym: The thing is what the cell phone we had.

518
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:18,739
Rym: the caveat was because we were not rich.

519
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:24,475
Rym: You had very short conversations on that phone or it was a problem.

520
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:28,984
Rym: it's my conversation with things like Sunday.

521
00:33:29,004 --> 00:33:31,440
Rym: I've got 45 seconds left to explain to you where to pick me up.

522
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,931
Scott: Okay, that's when you would buy minutes for your cell phone.

523
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:35,297
Scott: play minutes.

524
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:35,900
Scott: Do you have now?

525
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,646
Scott: Everyone just says unlimited talking text.

526
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:38,992
Scott: They don't remember the times when it's like.

527
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:40,839
Scott: yeah, you only bought 10 minutes of talk.

528
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,485
Rym: Yeah, you talk for 10 minutes.

529
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:44,130
Scott: if you talk for 11 minutes, you're poor.

530
00:33:44,531 --> 00:33:47,300
Rym: but nowadays I really only need to send.

531
00:33:48,269 --> 00:34:01,060
Rym: When I renew my lease I need to send a giant like the envelope full of like a really thick document somewhere like so once every couple years and I Don't have to ever send letters.

532
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,662
Rym: Otherwise.

533
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:03,669
Scott: just about every company has updated.

534
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:05,776
Rym: even my rent is just automatically paid now.

535
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:08,467
Scott: paperless billing You know, so you don't have to send anything.

536
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:17,949
Scott: when you pay a bill you get your bill in an email like just about all the uses of Mailing things have been eliminated and replaced with digital equivalent.

537
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:21,460
Rym: Well mailing things like letters right information, right?

538
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,556
Scott: So it's like I have.

539
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:28,848
Rym: our friend Chase was in Singapore and I had a and I had a whole bunch of Singapore dollars and I didn't think I'd go Back there anytime soon.

540
00:34:28,888 --> 00:34:30,440
Rym: and here I am going back to Singapore.

541
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:35,239
Rym: So we just stuffed all the Singapore money we had in an envelope just mailed it to him, right?

542
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:35,884
Scott: It's like you can't.

543
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:38,179
Scott: you know, I guess you could wire the money but it's yeah.

544
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:38,703
Rym: Why are you money?

545
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:40,290
Rym: would it cost more than that money was?

546
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,280
Rym: wiring money is crazy expensive, right?

547
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,652
Scott: And the point is you have Singapore dollars wiring money.

548
00:34:45,693 --> 00:34:47,078
Scott: Well, you could just wire any fucking currency.

549
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:51,179
Rym: Yeah Then I would still have had these Singapore dollars.

550
00:34:51,260 --> 00:35:01,498
Scott: Yeah, but the post office is transformed from something that was to send Information and stuff to send stuff and sending stuff was super expensive and kind of rare, right?

551
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,680
Scott: You would usually all the stuff would be sent to stores and like by freight and you would go to stores to get stuff.

552
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,485
Rym: Yeah, my parents when we bought furniture.

553
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:21,357
Rym: like many times it was freight shipping meaning it would be delivered to a freight distribution center and then we had to pay someone else to Drive it to our house or we had to go to a freight distribution center and pick it up right.

554
00:35:21,658 --> 00:35:28,056
Scott: and nowadays The post office and other shipping companies are all about sending stuff and not really about sending information.

555
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:29,440
Rym: Thanks primarily to Amazon.

556
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:34,998
Rym: So nowadays it's I very rarely ship things, but I very commonly receive shipments.

557
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:38,220
Scott: Yes And that's it's so weird.

558
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,340
Scott: It's like even when I'm thinking it's like well, I haven't bought anything in a long time.

559
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,689
Scott: I'm done buying stuff everything I need for like months.

560
00:35:44,031 --> 00:35:49,034
Scott: The only things I'm buying are like, you know Consumable goods that like, you know have to keep replenishing.

561
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:49,779
Scott: Yeah, right.

562
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:54,053
Scott: And meanwhile, I still keep getting fucking packages in the mail all the time.

563
00:35:54,114 --> 00:36:01,811
Scott: I'm like, Jesus Christ this, you know I feel like every other day some Amazon package shows up and like Fuck it on Amazon in like a month.

564
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:02,232
Scott: What the hell?

565
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:03,737
Rym: Yeah, but then I open the box.

566
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:05,464
Rym: I'm like, oh, yeah It's that thing I needed.

567
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:09,039
Scott: It's like oh, I needed that shoe hard for my boots or whatever.

568
00:36:09,762 --> 00:36:13,941
Scott: But it's like, you know the the doorman are now like, you know in the city Didn't?

569
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:17,759
Scott: they used to be people that open the door for you or helped you out, you know?

570
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,573
Rym: Yeah, I don't have.

571
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:20,039
Rym: 90% of what they do.

572
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:25,896
Scott: Dorman do now is collect all the packages and distribute them to the people who are.

573
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:28,812
Rym: building only has like 140 something apartments in.

574
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:38,532
Rym: it's a pretty small building and despite that the mail room where like the doorman keep like all the packages is Stuffed to the brim with packages.

575
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:46,226
Scott: literally every day I think everyone comes home and picks up all their packages probably within a day or two unless they're out of town and meanwhile More just keep coming.

576
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:55,360
Scott: So that room at night after all the deliveries have come in It's empty should be pretty empty and then it's literally the next day is like just completely full overflowing when the deliveries come.

577
00:36:55,882 --> 00:37:00,798
Rym: And even funnier there isn't even a break on Sunday because a lot of people use there's.

578
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,760
Rym: you know It used to be like when I was a kid.

579
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,962
Rym: I remember there was the post office or like UPS or if you were a business FedEx.

580
00:37:08,584 --> 00:37:12,073
Rym: there weren't really other ways for normal people to ship things.

581
00:37:12,735 --> 00:37:16,185
Rym: There weren't that many companies, but now there's all these Semi-independent.

582
00:37:16,225 --> 00:37:17,330
Scott: there were but it was.

583
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,715
Scott: it wasn't so easy, right?

584
00:37:18,795 --> 00:37:19,940
Scott: It's like you had to go.

585
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,959
Scott: They were either specialized or I had to go and get like UP.

586
00:37:23,181 --> 00:37:28,340
Scott: They're like UPS store is a thing that only came into existence like during in my memory.

587
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:32,420
Scott: Yeah, like I remember when there were no FedEx and UPS stores, right?

588
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,686
Scott: You wanted to mail a thing.

589
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:36,500
Scott: you had to like package it up yourself.

590
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:45,693
Scott: You couldn't like go and print out a shipping label and your computer like go to the post office Go to a special place and do special stuff and prepare.

591
00:37:45,773 --> 00:37:56,140
Rym: it was you know, shipping was not simple Yep, and when I actually raw ship something it is really easy now mostly because like remember my camera broke So I had to ship that giant camera.

592
00:37:56,261 --> 00:38:00,387
Scott: Well, if you go to a UPS store type place, you know or a FedEx King They just handle it.

593
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:01,840
Scott: you can give them an object.

594
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:06,137
Scott: Oh, yeah, and be like mail this object to this address and you pay them enough money.

595
00:38:06,177 --> 00:38:08,026
Scott: They will box Bubble wrap.

596
00:38:08,126 --> 00:38:08,749
Rym: Oh, I did that.

597
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:12,949
Rym: I don't trust myself to box a like $4,000 giant camera.

598
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:19,273
Scott: just give them the objects you want to send and they will Take care of literally every aspect of the shipping and you just give them money.

599
00:38:19,393 --> 00:38:23,088
Rym: Yep, and it wasn't that much they wanted like $11 to like.

600
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,480
Scott: right if you box it yourself, you can save some money.

601
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:30,180
Scott: Also, they'll have like in the store like boxes and tapes like you could just buy the supplies.

602
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:33,266
Rym: Yeah yourself, but they'll make if I box it myself They were like.

603
00:38:33,286 --> 00:38:37,520
Rym: you can boxes yourself But then you have to sign this thing saying if it breaks it's not our fault.

604
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,314
Scott: The biggest hassle is that if you're in a situation where you're a seller of things, right?

605
00:38:42,935 --> 00:38:45,403
Rym: Oh my god the GeekNights t-shirts I'll tell my anecdote.

606
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,169
Scott: You're silly if you're selling things.

607
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:52,164
Scott: First of all, you got quantity problems, but the big problem we have is pricing problems.

608
00:38:52,225 --> 00:39:01,899
Scott: because much like we talked about long-distance phone calls Sending stuff unless you use flat rate shipping, which is usually not the most economical is just simple.

609
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:05,890
Scott: Sometimes it's most economical but it's you had to calculate.

610
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:13,197
Scott: to figure out if it is right is you need to know the weight Based on the weight of the things you're sending their shape and also where you're sending them to.

611
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:19,439
Scott: the price will vary and it is very hard to accurately calculate in advance the shipping price.

612
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:25,956
Scott: and But when you sell something to someone you want to charge them shipping and handling before right?

613
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:29,368
Scott: Yeah want to be like, okay Give me money for the thing then I'll mail it.

614
00:39:29,629 --> 00:39:34,288
Scott: then you then I'll tell you what it cost to set me to mail it And then I trust you to send me that money.

615
00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:36,940
Scott: They'll send you zero because you've already mailed it, right?

616
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:48,375
Scott: It's like you got to charge the shipping in advance not being able to completely accurately calculate what that shipping will be Unless you have like a postal scale and all sorts of stuff going on.

617
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:53,006
Rym: and you see this especially with Kickstarters.

618
00:39:53,408 --> 00:40:04,950
Rym: so many people will do a Kickstarter But they don't really understand the logistics of shipping things and then they end up losing money on their whole Kickstarter because I couldn't afford to pay the shipping costs

619
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:19,903
Scott: like, you know, okay, I start a Kickstarter right and it's like, okay I'll charge, you know $5 to US shipping and $20 for international shipping, right and then Somehow your project gets really popular in I don't know Lithuania.

620
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:25,120
Scott: Yeah, and it turns out it costs $30 to ship to Lithuania and a hundred people bought your thing.

621
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,509
Scott: They're a hundred people from Lithuania kick-started you.

622
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:29,035
Scott: that's now a hundred times ten.

623
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:30,541
Scott: You just lost $1,000.

624
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:37,479
Rym: Yep, right now the easy thing is that like the GeekNights t-shirt, which stay tuned That design is so old like it's Scott still has hair.

625
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,412
Rym: I'm making some new GeekNights' t-shirts.

626
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:40,116
Rym: I'm working on that.

627
00:40:40,136 --> 00:40:40,660
Rym: So stay tuned.

628
00:40:41,043 --> 00:40:43,804
Rym: but in the old days I did all like.

629
00:40:43,844 --> 00:40:51,986
Rym: we made the t-shirts ourselves like directly working with t-shirt companies and screen printers and In the house and later the apartment.

630
00:40:52,086 --> 00:41:00,800
Rym: I just had this giant giant shelf filled with t-shirts of every different size and Like three different days like on Monday Wednesday and Saturday.

631
00:41:00,901 --> 00:41:14,540
Rym: I would just look at all the orders that came in Package all of them up and then I'd go to work and over lunch I just lugged this like box full of these packages to the post office and one by one I'd put them on the scale and I'd mail them all away.

632
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,527
Scott: That sucks scale and print out a thing.

633
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,156
Scott: You'd slap it on scale print out of things slap it on.

634
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:25,810
Rym: Yep sucked ass Yep, so what I ended up doing now is I just can't.

635
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:33,040
Rym: Amazon just makes the t-shirts for me prints them on demand They handle everything and they handle the shipping just in Amazon.

636
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,014
Scott: There's a lot of like these fulfillment services now for people who just they want to.

637
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:37,416
Scott: you want to.

638
00:41:37,516 --> 00:41:41,051
Scott: your business is Buying and selling stuffs, right?

639
00:41:41,191 --> 00:41:43,020
Scott: Yeah, and so you will focus on the stuff.

640
00:41:43,382 --> 00:41:53,480
Scott: there are a lot of businesses that just focus on the shipping logistics part and You will you can like just send them your stuff and then they take care of distributing it to all the different place.

641
00:41:53,500 --> 00:42:00,159
Scott: You know, it's like distributors, you know Sometimes it's a distributor, but sometimes it's not sometimes like a fulfillment center.

642
00:42:00,702 --> 00:42:04,439
Scott: Now basically, you know you outsource that biz and you lose some money on it.

643
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:14,399
Scott: Like if you do if you let Amazon do it yet You have to pay them for like the time if you leave something in an Amazon warehouse You got to pay them for the space it takes up and the time it's there.

644
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,429
Scott: Yep, but you know at least.

645
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:21,736
Scott: then you know if someone buys it you don't have to do anything You just let you just get a notification like someone bought your thing.

646
00:42:21,776 --> 00:42:22,319
Scott: Here's your money.

647
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:29,861
Rym: The thing that I find the most annoying is the times I've had to return like it's sort of like the consequence of our delivery culture.

648
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:42,340
Rym: now if something shows up broken and I have to return it or if something Doesn't work out and end up having to return it to get it repaired or serviced or something But I've already thrown out the box that came in because I live.

649
00:42:43,282 --> 00:42:43,805
Scott: Big mistake.

650
00:42:43,966 --> 00:42:44,912
Rym: that's happened many times.

651
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:46,200
Rym: I don't keep the boxes very long.

652
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:49,746
Scott: You still have the box.

653
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:51,392
Scott: you can just print out a return label.

654
00:42:51,433 --> 00:42:53,220
Scott: sometimes there's even a return label in the box.

655
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,760
Scott: Yep you just put the thing back in the box put the thing on and I can actually go like the.

656
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:02,256
Scott: There's like bodegas in my neighborhood that are like UPS centers or FedEx centers.

657
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:03,160
Scott: I could just bring it.

658
00:43:06,132 --> 00:43:07,607
Rym: Your your device is making a noise.

659
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:12,406
Rym: Why are you interrupting the show with your weird device noise that you don't recognize?

660
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:14,982
Rym: anyway I don't think that noise came from any of my devices.

661
00:43:15,103 --> 00:43:19,220
Scott: Anyway, the point is You can just drop it off there, you know tape it shut.

662
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,589
Scott: all you need is tape and a label and you're good.

663
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,242
Scott: However, I've had this sometimes depending on where you live.

664
00:43:26,302 --> 00:43:28,490
Scott: could there's an even more convenient return option?

665
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:31,729
Scott: Right buy something and you know from online.

666
00:43:32,771 --> 00:43:36,310
Scott: But if that place you bought it from online is Zappos, well, you have to mail it back.

667
00:43:36,412 --> 00:43:43,270
Scott: Yeah, right But buy something online and that store happens to be in your neighborhood the Microsoft store for my laptop.

668
00:43:43,698 --> 00:43:44,270
Scott: Walk to the market.

669
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:49,570
Scott: Buy something online from Apple and then it you get a broken iPhone in the mail.

670
00:43:49,932 --> 00:43:52,990
Scott: You go to the Apple store and then you can deal with that much more easily.

671
00:43:53,191 --> 00:43:55,469
Rym: But again, that's something that only applies to people who live in cities.

672
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:56,494
Rym: Yeah aren't that?

673
00:43:56,535 --> 00:44:03,069
Scott: many of those can also Buy things online and have them sent to a store of the same brand and pick it up at the store.

674
00:44:03,836 --> 00:44:04,829
Scott: I know if the store is near you.

675
00:44:05,313 --> 00:44:10,219
Rym: I remember the only time we've I've ever really had like a Mailing failure like a bad one was you and me.

676
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,162
Rym: wasn't that bad.

677
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:14,216
Rym: Remember we went to the first packs, Australia Yep, and we had that.

678
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:16,290
Rym: there was that giant Animal Crossing poster.

679
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,440
Rym: Oh, yeah that we got.

680
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,750
Rym: that was like the official thing from the booth.

681
00:44:21,312 --> 00:44:24,001
Scott: It was a special Animal Crossing poster that you would like.

682
00:44:24,202 --> 00:44:26,269
Scott: you would take a photo with QR codes on it.

683
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:33,135
Rym: Yeah, and then you would get Animal Crossing biz on your D and after Pax Pax was like you guys are still around for some Reason go home.

684
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:35,225
Rym: But also do you want any of this garbage?

685
00:44:35,245 --> 00:44:36,110
Rym: We're just gonna throw it away.

686
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,475
Scott: So we're just hanging all over.

687
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:41,070
Scott: we took, you know, I guess Pax Os people got exclusive Animal Crossing biz.

688
00:44:41,451 --> 00:44:42,374
Scott: So we took the poster.

689
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:47,650
Scott: we mailed it to our Animal Crossing loving friend at the very very good Australian post office.

690
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,747
Rym: Yeah, we went to the post office and it was great.

691
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:53,061
Rym: Like everything seemed like a post office is way better.

692
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:54,144
Scott: the American post office is.

693
00:44:54,185 --> 00:44:55,952
Scott: I guess they spend more money on it They're not.

694
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:57,743
Scott: the government isn't trying to make it suck.

695
00:44:57,924 --> 00:44:58,145
Rym: Yep.

696
00:44:58,286 --> 00:45:00,294
Rym: Our post office It's pretty hard to make it good.

697
00:45:00,314 --> 00:45:09,490
Rym: our post office is good is actually really great considering that the Republican Party has spent 80 years both not 80 more like 40 years trying to destroy it, right?

698
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:09,791
Scott: It's like.

699
00:45:09,992 --> 00:45:13,830
Scott: it's like, you know, we talk about that all the time how the people will complain.

700
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,281
Scott: It's like governments always fuck up everything.

701
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:16,723
Scott: Therefore.

702
00:45:16,783 --> 00:45:18,370
Scott: We shouldn't have governments run things.

703
00:45:18,711 --> 00:45:21,440
Scott: Let's cut funding to things that the government sucks at doing.

704
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,406
Scott: and it's like well actually you're.

705
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:24,670
Scott: it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

706
00:45:24,771 --> 00:45:28,210
Scott: If you just give gave more money to the thing it would stop sucking.

707
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:33,233
Rym: It'd be like if I wanted GeekNights to fail and I just made GeekNights bad on purpose So it would fail.

708
00:45:33,373 --> 00:45:37,267
Scott: right for example, right the government never says our military sucks.

709
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,455
Scott: Yeah, right Let's cut funding to it instead.

710
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:45,017
Scott: They continue to fund it and I mean regardless of whether you think we should be doing that Which right is a separate issue.

711
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:48,696
Scott: Oh, look, it doesn't suck because you spent money on it You made it not suck.

712
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:50,750
Scott: if you spend money in the post office you make it not suck.

713
00:45:51,112 --> 00:45:53,910
Scott: Australia clearly spent money in their post office and made it not suck.

714
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,696
Scott: But I don't think that poster ever got.

715
00:45:55,716 --> 00:45:57,462
Scott: poster did not get where it was going.

716
00:45:57,482 --> 00:45:58,385
Rym: It just disappeared.

717
00:45:58,506 --> 00:45:59,750
Rym: It's gone for about a tube.

718
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:00,879
Scott: I put the thing in the tube.

719
00:46:00,919 --> 00:46:02,149
Scott: I wrote the address on the tube.

720
00:46:02,512 --> 00:46:03,477
Scott: I walked up to the counter.

721
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:05,549
Rym: have photos of you putting it in the tube?

722
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,518
Scott: Yeah, I guess it never got there.

723
00:46:07,578 --> 00:46:08,944
Scott: cuz no one ever told me they got it.

724
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:10,470
Rym: maybe one day it'll get delivered.

725
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:11,899
Rym: Is it a dead letter bin somewhere?

726
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,403
Rym: I don't know.

727
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:18,418
Rym: Is occasionally like I get letters or I see letters?

728
00:46:18,478 --> 00:46:22,090
Rym: but people definitely don't know how to fill out envelopes anymore.

729
00:46:24,411 --> 00:46:34,367
Scott: They taught us in school was like how to format a business letter how to write addresses on an envelope how to do all this stuff and You know, I still it's a useful skill.

730
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:38,146
Scott: But I think a people aren't taught that anymore because you don't do it as much.

731
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:38,930
Scott: but there's what bothers me.

732
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:40,937
Rym: I'm not the old man who's gonna complain.

733
00:46:41,037 --> 00:46:44,589
Scott: office will surprisingly deliver things if the address is written.

734
00:46:44,689 --> 00:46:48,463
Rym: really Remember when Penn Jillette said hey try to mail shit to me.

735
00:46:48,804 --> 00:46:50,990
Rym: Just write Penn Jillette Las Vegas Yeah.

736
00:46:51,151 --> 00:47:01,089
Scott: and like a weird person like a high percentage of those letters made it to him the The threshold for which what you write on an envelope will get to where you think it's gonna go.

737
00:47:02,432 --> 00:47:06,533
Rym: Just won't quit Pretty low.

738
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:10,326
Scott: you could probably write like Scott Reuben Queens, New York.

739
00:47:10,366 --> 00:47:11,330
Scott: It might get to me.

740
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:14,742
Rym: Yeah Penn Jillette did an experiment with that where a bunch of the letters made it to him.

741
00:47:14,822 --> 00:47:24,979
Scott: also surprised seen people do stuff like Just take objects and just write just like put a sticker or literally write the address on the object Yeah, and then mail it with no box and it goes.

742
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:27,367
Scott: I saw something like mailed a baseball bat with like.

743
00:47:27,588 --> 00:47:29,510
Scott: they just wrote on It with a sharpie and it got there.

744
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:32,358
Rym: Yeah, the post office is really good because they had.

745
00:47:32,378 --> 00:47:43,856
Rym: they use a lot of technology like zip codes and OCR and like systems To handle all the mail that can be handled automatically, but then if none of these automated systems work There's always some letters or something's funky.

746
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:53,730
Rym: a human being literally looks at it and decides with their human intelligence How to solve this problem and it works surprisingly Well, the post office is a model for that kind of your design.

747
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:57,135
Scott: The thing is they're used for return addresses on things You know, you don't have to.

748
00:47:57,235 --> 00:47:58,220
Scott: but yeah you can.

749
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,541
Scott: and if you say put an envelope in a mailbox With a return address and you forgot to put a stamp on it.

750
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:05,570
Scott: They send it back to the return address.

751
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:11,366
Scott: Yeah, or I always thought why don't I put the return address as the place I wanted to go to.

752
00:48:11,386 --> 00:48:14,810
Rym: Oh Yeah, the good old return address scam, right?

753
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:19,650
Rym: I always thought about that too and you know why I never looked into actually trying to do it because the stamp was a quarter.

754
00:48:19,918 --> 00:48:22,769
Scott: Yeah That's also why I haven't actually tried to do it.

755
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:31,990
Scott: I've always wondered like what if I put the return address as the address I wanted to go to and my address is the Main address and then not put a stamp and shove it in a mailbox and see what happens.

756
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:37,050
Scott: I think if it was a faraway place, they would be like, yeah return address, Florida.

757
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:37,835
Scott: I don't think so.

758
00:48:37,896 --> 00:48:40,050
Scott: New York post a post box mailbox.

759
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:45,990
Scott: Yeah, I looked this up a few times, but if I did like another person in the neighborhood, I feel like it might work, right?

760
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,870
Rym: I'm pretty sure they have way like they can detect that this situation has happened.

761
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:55,824
Rym: But the question is would they care unless it was something big and expensive?

762
00:48:55,884 --> 00:48:57,809
Rym: Yep, in which case I'm pretty sure they would care.

763
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:58,851
Scott: Mm-hmm.

764
00:48:59,795 --> 00:49:02,746
Rym: I don't care enough because I don't need to save what I guess.

765
00:49:02,746 --> 00:49:06,840
Scott: 55 cents Effectively zero because my forever stamps are so old.

766
00:49:07,202 --> 00:49:08,970
Scott: I'm like saving money by using those stamps.

767
00:49:09,051 --> 00:49:10,661
Rym: Yeah, I bought those stamps when they came out.

768
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:11,487
Rym: Well, not when they came out.

769
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:11,869
Rym: I bought them.

770
00:49:12,493 --> 00:49:14,945
Rym: I want to say five or six years ago is the last time about stamps.

771
00:49:15,106 --> 00:49:15,930
Scott: You know, I know some trivia.

772
00:49:16,612 --> 00:49:22,710
Scott: So, you know Ponzi scheme Ponzi, yeah, you know what the original the guy Ponzi the actual person is named after.

773
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:25,410
Scott: Yeah, you know what their original scam was Sam collecting.

774
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:33,010
Scott: No It was a stamp scam where basically there was a way to buy like stamp prices, right?

775
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,215
Scott: It was basically arbitrage.

776
00:49:34,236 --> 00:49:36,225
Scott: You know how we talk about steam games are cheap elsewhere.

777
00:49:36,246 --> 00:49:43,207
Scott: Yeah, right He was basically like listen I got this thing where I buy stamps in another country and then resell them in the US at.

778
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:48,681
Scott: you know Undercut post office stamp prices But they're still way higher than the foreign stamp price.

779
00:49:49,062 --> 00:49:52,754
Scott: and then I make a lot of money selling all these stamps Invest in my business.

780
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:54,378
Scott: everyone invested in the business.

781
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:55,501
Scott: He Ponzi schemed.

782
00:49:55,521 --> 00:49:57,907
Scott: He never bought a goddamn stamp.

783
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:01,016
Scott: That was just a lie But that was the scam.

784
00:50:01,036 --> 00:50:10,990
Scott: Yeah, not bad original Ponzi scheme was Claim that you're buying cheap stamps in a foreign country and selling them for a few pennies less than American price in America.

785
00:50:11,232 --> 00:50:16,781
Rym: Oh in the stream to someone from Canada as a question Do we have mail machines for returning prepaid packages at post offices?

786
00:50:16,801 --> 00:50:18,768
Rym: Apparently Canada has that a mail machine a machine.

787
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:23,570
Rym: You can just return a prepaid like something that was shipped to you with a prepaid thing.

788
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,184
Rym: You can just return it generically via the post office.

789
00:50:26,204 --> 00:50:27,269
Rym: We do not have anything like that.

790
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:28,496
Scott: No, you have to get.

791
00:50:28,516 --> 00:50:31,170
Scott: yeah, if it's like UPS like a Zappos, right?

792
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:32,358
Rym: You need like a specific.

793
00:50:32,439 --> 00:50:41,245
Scott: I print a return label I tape it on the box with the shoes inside and I go to a Has to be a UPS place and then I need this has to be a person with a scanner.

794
00:50:41,265 --> 00:50:42,573
Scott: that goes peep and then it's Like.

795
00:50:42,593 --> 00:50:43,309
Scott: you don't have to do much.

796
00:50:43,471 --> 00:50:47,989
Scott: Usually I could walk into the store put a Zappos box in the counter and they'll just give me a thumbs up.

797
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:49,399
Scott: Yeah, and you're good to go now.

798
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,790
Rym: what we do have that's pretty good.

799
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,903
Rym: If you go to a US post office in the modern era, they have self-service machines.

800
00:50:55,565 --> 00:50:57,010
Rym: They're actually pretty amazing.

801
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:02,180
Scott: it's basically a scale a touchscreen and you put your thing on a wheel.

802
00:51:02,461 --> 00:51:03,705
Scott: you mess with the touchscreen.

803
00:51:03,806 --> 00:51:08,927
Scott: it prints out a Basically a digital but it'll do label and you slap it on your box.

804
00:51:09,028 --> 00:51:10,891
Rym: It'll do Anything.

805
00:51:11,313 --> 00:51:15,427
Rym: you can mail something almost anywhere in the world with all kinds of like.

806
00:51:15,467 --> 00:51:17,737
Rym: you can just do Anything and it just works.

807
00:51:17,797 --> 00:51:18,802
Rym: It's really easy to use.

808
00:51:19,164 --> 00:51:28,390
Rym: but every time I have to use that what I find is that there's only like three machines, which is fine and I've never seen a human being other than myself interact with one of these machines.

809
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:32,705
Scott: I see him use all the time in a manner that is intelligent and rational.

810
00:51:32,745 --> 00:51:33,026
Scott: You mean?

811
00:51:33,067 --> 00:51:36,490
Rym: Yeah, people are really slow Literally like when I had to mail our lease.

812
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:38,360
Rym: I couldn't just put stamps on it because it was big.

813
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,491
Rym: it there was a giant envelope and it was kind of heavy because it's Thick.

814
00:51:40,953 --> 00:51:41,697
Rym: so I was gonna use that.

815
00:51:41,717 --> 00:51:42,682
Rym: I did wait for that machine.

816
00:51:42,843 --> 00:51:44,170
Scott: Oh, I just crammed it in a regular envelope.

817
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:44,953
Rym: It's way too.

818
00:51:44,993 --> 00:51:46,076
Rym: It does not fit in a regular.

819
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:47,621
Rym: It's like 30 pages long.

820
00:51:47,882 --> 00:51:49,005
Scott: I managed it somehow.

821
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:50,370
Rym: How thin is your lease?

822
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,451
Scott: I tear off only the pages that have The.

823
00:51:53,592 --> 00:51:55,440
Rym: oh, no, we have to mail the whole thing back.

824
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,585
Rym: I have to sign it like 10 times.

825
00:51:57,911 --> 00:51:58,495
Scott: We'll see about that.

826
00:51:58,636 --> 00:52:00,046
Rym: I have a lot of riders on my lease.

827
00:52:00,227 --> 00:52:00,489
Rym: Uh-huh.

828
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,790
Rym: Anyway, also this year it had a whole bunch of like because there's a new law.

829
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:09,250
Rym: Here's things that your landlord has to tell you that I had to initial that I read and all this nonsense.

830
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,395
Rym: Anyway, I was there.

831
00:52:11,435 --> 00:52:12,178
Rym: There's three machines.

832
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:13,783
Rym: One of us broken, you know America.

833
00:52:14,485 --> 00:52:15,870
Rym: the other two there was no line.

834
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:24,988
Rym: There's just one person each one late lady was trying to like mail a small package somewhere And the other one was just a man trying to mail what looked like a normal letter.

835
00:52:26,371 --> 00:52:29,368
Rym: Neither one of them was finished with these machines after 20 minutes.

836
00:52:30,931 --> 00:52:35,869
Scott: They were just like usually when I go to the post office, they'll be a postal worker who's like helping people with the machines.

837
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,676
Rym: Yeah, they seem.

838
00:52:37,837 --> 00:52:40,628
Rym: neither one of these people seem to quite understand how mail works.

839
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:42,232
Rym: Yeah It was.

840
00:52:42,252 --> 00:52:43,977
Rym: it was really frustrating to the counter.

841
00:52:44,459 --> 00:52:48,432
Rym: the counter had a crazy long line of people mailing giant packages that I wanted nothing To do with.

842
00:52:48,694 --> 00:52:53,696
Rym: yep, because the post office I go to is the one next to Grand Central Like the big one the big one.

843
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:55,524
Rym: That's the one where I go to like passport stuff.

844
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:57,030
Scott: Yeah, you can do that almost.

845
00:52:57,491 --> 00:53:04,850
Scott: Yeah, yeah, we're not gonna talk about all the services the post office like money orders certified mails registered mails express mails.

846
00:53:05,513 --> 00:53:13,244
Rym: It's funny whenever I mail just like a letter like the few times I do it It costs a little that I'm almost just like I'll go full-on signature.

847
00:53:13,264 --> 00:53:15,050
Rym: You got a fucking sign to get my letter.

848
00:53:15,456 --> 00:53:16,390
Rym: I said you a Christmas card.

849
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:22,816
Rym: You have to sign and I'm gonna get a signature receipt because it costs like a dollar And it's just funny to do that.

850
00:53:22,856 --> 00:53:30,090
Rym: So be I have had fun Many times more earlier than now because I don't mail things that often anymore.

851
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:34,029
Rym: But I could put a lot of stuff into a flat rate box.

852
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:38,923
Rym: Oh, yeah, I have put terrifying amounts of weight in a flat rate boxes before lead brick.

Rym: There will be careful.

857
00:53:49,412 --> 00:53:50,796
Rym: I just imagined someone's gonna put like.

858
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:55,370
Rym: they're gonna write Scott Ruben Queens on an apple and just drop it in a post office box.

859
00:53:55,552 --> 00:53:58,849
