00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,878
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 12th, 2019.

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:12,420
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,583
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:15,006
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:19,766
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about Gunsmith Cats, the OAV from the mid 90s.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,527
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:36,185
Rym: So my office is right by a place in New York that most people know, like, if they live here or come here often, they know what this place is, but they don't know that it's called something.

8
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:37,370
Rym: Pershing Square.

9
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:38,053
Rym: Mm hmm.

10
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:48,593
Rym: That it's basically in the front of Grand Central Terminal or Grand Central Station and Terminal together, there's a little viaduct that has a road on it because they made a road split around Grand Central.

11
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:50,238
Scott: Well, it's Park Avenue, right?

12
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:56,410
Scott: Because basically you go down Park Avenue and to the left is, you know, Madison Avenue and to the right is Lexington Avenue.

13
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:56,671
Scott: Yep.

14
00:00:56,912 --> 00:01:00,530
Scott: But Park Avenue can't go right through the middle of the train station.

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:07,110
Scott: So it goes up and then it goes splits in half and goes around Grand Central, right?

16
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:13,849
Scott: And then in the back of Grand Central, there's these two like ramps that turn and go down and then it becomes Park Avenue again.

17
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,739
Scott: And then that Park Avenue is like a road.

18
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:19,890
Scott: that's like has a big median in it to begin with, right?

19
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,229
Scott: So it still has that big ass median on the other side.

20
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,164
Rym: Yep, but under that little bridge, there's a restaurant.

21
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:27,670
Scott: We went to it a long time ago.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,532
Rym: Yep, and I remember they had a really good chicken pot pie and their breakfast is pathetic.

23
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:37,950
Scott: It was really interesting because I would see the restaurant constantly because I went when the days when I went to Grand Central constantly.

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,450
Rym: Yeah, if I was like really just like, oh, I don't want to eat dinner there.

25
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,050
Scott: It always had this sign in the front that was like best breakfast.

26
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:46,055
Scott: Oh, my God.

27
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:48,810
Scott: And I ate the breakfast once and I was not impressed.

28
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,550
Scott: It was like, you know, diner or less and it was more money than diner.

29
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:56,750
Rym: But I would rather eat it at Denny's than eat there for breakfast.

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,610
Scott: But the dinner that I've had there a few times, but not in many, many years, who knows what's changed.

31
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,330
Scott: Yeah, but I had dinner there maybe a handful of times many years ago just because convenience.

32
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:14,530
Scott: And the dinner, while not like interesting, it was like perfectly normal dishes of, you know, just like restaurant, whatever.

33
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,630
Scott: Yeah, but they were quite good.

34
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,369
Scott: Like it was very flavorful chicken and a nice potato.

35
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:28,250
Scott: And, you know, it was like boring food, but high quality, boring food at not too much overpriced, considering it's right there in front of Grand Central.

36
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,710
Rym: But at a restaurant like to picture this, it's basically built into the bottom of this bridge.

37
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:35,313
Scott: Yeah.

38
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,488
Scott: So like on top of the restaurant is a road.

39
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,191
Scott: Right.

40
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:45,450
Scott: And on the left and right sides are roads that you can't really drive on because they're like they turn them into pedestrian only zone, kind of.

41
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:45,753
Scott: Yeah.

42
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:46,730
Rym: So that's what I'm getting at.

43
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,324
Scott: And right in front of the restaurant is 42nd Street.

44
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:49,412
Scott: And right.

45
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:53,250
Scott: If you just go out of the restaurant and just cross the road, there's entrance to Grand Central.

46
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:57,310
Scott: So for a long time, Pershing Square is the name of like the square.

47
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:57,894
Scott: Yeah.

48
00:02:57,955 --> 00:02:59,429
Scott: But it's also the name of the restaurant.

49
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:00,454
Rym: Yeah.

50
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:02,350
Rym: And there's a little old sign there.

51
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:12,369
Rym: But basically, this area was really kind of like run down, like the bridge and the sidewalk and like the streets that weren't on top of the bridge were all just really run down and beat up.

52
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,133
Scott: Well, they've been.

53
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,090
Scott: they've been polishing it slowly over the years.

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,591
Scott: Well, that's it.

55
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:25,690
Rym: So a while ago, like over a year ago, they blocked it all off and they started doing a big reconstruction project and they actually only recently removed all those fences.

56
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:29,050
Rym: Now it's just open again and there's a big pedestrian plaza there.

57
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:33,450
Rym: And now there's kind of like in Times Square, they got all those tables in those in what used to be the street.

58
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:33,834
Rym: Yeah.

59
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:35,270
Rym: They got that same thing going on here.

60
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:43,170
Rym: And now there's outdoor seating for that restaurant in that area and public seating that's not tied to the restaurant also there.

61
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:46,329
Rym: So I've been eating lunch like outside of these tables is real nice.

62
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,930
Rym: But something interesting happened.

63
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,828
Scott: The restaurant harassed you?

64
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:51,257
Rym: Oh, no, restaurant doesn't care.

65
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,263
Rym: It's a public land.

66
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:53,310
Scott: because I was going to say.

67
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,549
Scott: But, you know, restaurants do that, right?

68
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,664
Rym: Yeah, but they don't.

69
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:56,110
Rym: They're there.

70
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:56,970
Rym: They know better.

71
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,371
Rym: OK.

72
00:03:57,652 --> 00:04:04,170
Rym: And also right next to that in 120 Park, the whole lobby of that building is technically public space.

73
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,471
Scott: Yep.

74
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:07,150
Rym: So like you'll see people playing board games in there.

75
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:07,743
Rym: I know that one.

76
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:08,070
Rym: Yep.

77
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,909
Rym: Like so there's a whole bunch of public spaces there now and it's a pretty good place to hang out.

78
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:18,170
Rym: But when they open this area, it is technically designated as a park.

79
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:23,410
Rym: And what that means is that in New York City, you cannot smoke in any park.

80
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:24,058
Rym: That's right.

81
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,890
Rym: No exceptions.

82
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:26,729
Rym: Like the cops will bother you if you can.

83
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,956
Scott: Smoke on the sidewalk.

84
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,250
Scott: You can smoke in your own car that you own.

85
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,069
Scott: You can smoke in your place of residence if you own it.

86
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,450
Scott: And but like in my apartment building is no smoking rule.

87
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:36,912
Scott: You can't.

88
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,910
Scott: But, you know, if you own a house, no one's going to start smoking in your own house.

89
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,171
Scott: Right.

90
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:40,533
Scott: Yeah.

91
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:44,530
Rym: Unless you own a house that's too close to someone else's house and you smoke too much.

92
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,270
Rym: Maybe the point is over nuisance.

93
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:46,830
Scott: Right.

94
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:50,970
Scott: You can also smoke in certain like cigar shops have like smoking zones.

95
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:51,416
Scott: Yeah.

96
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:51,740
Scott: Right.

97
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:52,349
Scott: Stuff like that.

98
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,050
Scott: But you can't smoke in a place of business.

99
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,170
Scott: You can't smoke in a park.

100
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,910
Scott: You can't smoke in like, you know, your apartment that you rent that has a no smoking rule.

101
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,889
Scott: You can, you know, you can't smoke at work.

102
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:06,970
Scott: And it's worked in the sense that I encountered within a certain number of feet of an entrance to a building.

103
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,630
Scott: You sort of have to walk away from the building entrance to somewhere else that's not near any building entrances.

104
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:11,991
Rym: Yeah.

105
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:17,650
Rym: And it's to the point that in New York City, like the rare times I run into someone smoke it, it's so obvious.

106
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:24,850
Scott: Like I 99 percent of the time it's somebody walking on the sidewalk while smoking, which is pretty much the only place you can.

107
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,750
Scott: So behind him and have to run past him.

108
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,330
Rym: So something interesting happened because Pershing Square, the two sides of the bridge, the restaurant and the bridge are in the middle.

109
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,950
Rym: One side now is a big park with tables, meaning no one can smoke there.

110
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,250
Rym: And the other side of it is the city bike dock.

111
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,210
Rym: The other side of it is not actually a park.

112
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:45,229
Rym: It's just a pedestrian throughway.

113
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:55,150
Rym: Everyone who smokes anywhere in that area, the area with the city bike docks is the only place that you can actually legally smoke.

114
00:05:55,931 --> 00:06:02,869
Rym: So there are a ton of really sad looking people smoking there, sitting on the city bikes every day.

115
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:05,230
Rym: They're just sitting on the city bike smoking.

116
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:08,809
Rym: And there's one dude and I see him every day and I know which dude it is.

117
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,448
Rym: He's smoking weed there every day.

118
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:13,096
Scott: All right.

119
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:16,610
Rym: We just don't smoke cigarettes, smoke weed every day.

120
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,448
Rym: Yeah, I was going to make the show and then I got high.

121
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,008
Scott: So you got any news?

122
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:24,688
Scott: I do have a news.

123
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:35,630
Scott: So, you know, there have been various attempts over the years to make more, you know, Warner Brothers, Looney Tunes, you know, Forky Pig Bugs Bunny cartoons.

124
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,673
Rym: Make success.

125
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:39,142
Rym: Like there was a recent one that was basically just.

126
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,670
Scott: you could even count things like, you know, Tiny Toons.

127
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:42,770
Scott: Like big success.

128
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:43,370
Scott: Yeah.

129
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:43,732
Scott: Right.

130
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:46,970
Scott: You know, and other ones, not so much like the Seinfeld one.

131
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:47,711
Scott: Right.

132
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:53,510
Scott: But now there is a much more recent one, like literally just now.

133
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:55,929
Scott: And it seems like they're going to make a ton of them.

134
00:06:56,491 --> 00:07:01,210
Scott: And they're going to basically allow the animators to sort of go like full controls.

135
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:16,807
Scott: Like the team that works on one is going to like write it, direct it, animate it like, you know, so you'll get a lot of, you know, Similar to when Adventure Time would have guest animators, they'd be like, yeah, do whatever the hell you want.

136
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:17,470
Rym: Make it awesome.

137
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:25,690
Scott: So they're apparently have already made a bunch and are going to make a bunch more and distribute them like on all the places that they can distribute them.

138
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:28,150
Scott: And there is one on YouTube already.

139
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:29,449
Scott: I didn't watch the whole thing.

140
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:30,428
Rym: It was pretty good.

141
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,870
Scott: But what I've seen of it, it's like it's basically old school.

142
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:36,769
Scott: Like it's the real deal.

143
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,910
Scott: Like, yeah, they just made more of those from the olden days.

144
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,048
Scott: But it's the new days.

145
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,610
Rym: I've said this repeatedly because we've talked about all these shows like She-Ra, which is OK.

146
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,169
Rym: It's a children's show or BoJack, all these different, like there's a lot of animation happening right now.

147
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,633
Rym: Dragon Prince.

148
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:56,030
Rym: And we're entering like this new golden era of animation.

149
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:56,996
Rym: We're already in it.

150
00:07:57,057 --> 00:07:58,529
Rym: And I think it's just still continuing to grow.

151
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:05,030
Rym: But right now we're in an era where there are new good Mickey Mouse shorts and now new good Bugs Bunny shorts.

152
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:11,390
Scott: I mean, I think, you know, on the one hand, it's nice to see people doing something, you know, new and different.

153
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:11,692
Scott: Right.

154
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:14,450
Scott: We don't need to just repeat the same thing over and over again forever.

155
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:15,273
Scott: Right.

156
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,229
Scott: We like to see new things, original works.

157
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,131
Scott: Right.

158
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:24,750
Scott: And, you know, when people do retread a lot of old things, though, you know, they try to put a spin on it.

159
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,768
Scott: And that can be hit or miss.

160
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:29,349
Scott: And the thing is, oftentimes I think usually it's miss.

161
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:30,634
Rym: Yeah.

162
00:08:30,654 --> 00:08:39,650
Scott: And there are a lot of times and, you know, where it's like, hey, there was a thing that was good and we don't want to just repeat that good thing forever because that's tired and boring.

163
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,169
Rym: But if you change it, you change the thing that was good about it.

164
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:42,551
Scott: Right.

165
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:45,169
Scott: But we didn't get enough of that good thing.

166
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:45,751
Scott: Right.

167
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:50,070
Scott: Like I always say, Metroidvanias, just make another fucking Super Metroid.

168
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,030
Scott: The same exact fucking kind of thing can be Super Nintendo quality.

169
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,377
Scott: Just bigger.

170
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:56,970
Scott: Just how hard is this?

171
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,869
Rym: Take Symphony of the Night as is.

172
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:02,130
Rym: And now after you beat the Upside Down Castle, Sideways Castle.

173
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:02,869
Scott: 4D Castle.

174
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,790
Rym: Just more castle.

175
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:04,253
Scott: Right.

176
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,490
Scott: It's like you can just do the same.

177
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,250
Scott: You know, it's like, yeah, that was great.

178
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,510
Scott: And I see that you're doing something else, which could also be great.

179
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:13,490
Scott: But we didn't get enough of that great thing you did.

180
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:15,610
Scott: Just do it like one or two more times.

181
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,194
Scott: Don't go nuts.

182
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,050
Scott: Don't make like 10 Super Metroids.

183
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,230
Scott: Then we're going to go to sleep, right?

184
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:19,611
Rym: Yeah.

185
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:22,070
Rym: Like Mega Man, eight, nine, 10, 11.

186
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,172
Rym: Yeah.

187
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:23,250
Scott: It's like Mega Man 10.

188
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:23,720
Scott: Good job.

189
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:24,190
Scott: Eleven.

190
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,056
Scott: It's like, all right.

191
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:26,469
Scott: You know, it's like, come on.

192
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:29,050
Rym: I feel like 11 was better than 10.

193
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,789
Scott: The point is, we don't need that many more NES style Mega Mans.

194
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:34,411
Scott: Yeah.

195
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:36,070
Scott: We got, you know, one or two was fine.

196
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,712
Scott: You're right.

197
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,690
Scott: They're starting to go overboard making too many.

198
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:39,092
Scott: Right.

199
00:09:39,473 --> 00:09:52,030
Scott: But we do need another Super Metroid and we do need some more Looney Tunes, especially because a lot of the old Looney Tunes are racist, sexist, inappropriate or whatever, and probably shouldn't be watched anymore.

200
00:09:52,532 --> 00:09:52,652
Scott: Right.

201
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:57,910
Scott: There's only a handful of them that are, you know, still worthy and hold the test.

202
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:04,101
Rym: I can tell just based on watching a few again recently, the Yosemite Sam ones are by and large fine.

203
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:04,729
Scott: Yes.

204
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,749
Scott: Partly because it's just it's just a pirate dude.

205
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,552
Rym: Pirate dude.

206
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:12,470
Rym: Yosemite Sam is a very accurate representation of rural America.

207
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,789
Scott: Just an angry pirate dude.

208
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,629
Rym: Angry gun toting dude.

209
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,690
Scott: Whatever he is in the episode cowboy or whatever.

210
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:23,210
Rym: He'd be on Twitter with his two way hashtag.

211
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,238
Scott: Yeah.

212
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:27,630
Rym: But no, I think these are really good.

213
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,409
Rym: And I look forward to watching them.

214
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:37,229
Rym: And if if they're as good as the one I just saw, but they're not all just the same as the one I just saw, I feel like we're going to be really good shape.

215
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:37,691
Rym: Yeah.

216
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:44,810
Rym: So in some other news, Utena, there's got to be no more Utena like we don't say.

217
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,910
Scott: I mean, I thought it was going to be more Utena manga.

218
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,330
Rym: There is going to be more Utena manga.

219
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,668
Rym: But the manga is not why people care about Utena.

220
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,550
Rym: Let's not pretend otherwise.

221
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,989
Rym: That show is a triumph and it stands alone and apart.

222
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:05,848
Rym: But the musicals perennially come and go and the musicals have started to up their game and escalate a little bit.

223
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,170
Rym: So the current state of that is one.

224
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,150
Rym: If you don't know that there are Utena musicals, go to YouTube.

225
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,210
Scott: Well, there's musicals for like all kinds of anime.

226
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:15,611
Rym: Yeah.

227
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:17,910
Rym: We've talked about this on GeekNights before, like it's a thing.

228
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:18,713
Scott: Tons of them.

229
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:20,530
Rym: But the Utena ones are pretty interesting.

230
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:29,352
Scott: And they had like a resurgence lately, or at least if it's not an actual resurgence, it's a resurgence of Americans, you know, like getting reporting about which ones are happening.

231
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:29,653
Rym: Yep.

232
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:33,930
Rym: Because like hardcore Utena fans were like obsessed with the old Utena.

233
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,550
Scott: While we were at PAX, the Sailor Moon musical was like sold out in New York City.

234
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,810
Scott: I would have gone to see it otherwise.

235
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:45,885
Rym: I remember as a kid, I pirated all of the Sailor Moon music, including all the songs from the musicals.

236
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:51,416
Rym: And I remember being really excited about that because I couldn't actually get video of the musicals like.

237
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,748
Rym: that was really hard to pirate back in the 90s.

238
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,565
Scott: I have seen it being played at anime cons in the 2000s.

239
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,074
Scott: Yeah.

240
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,612
Scott: You know, like you go into a showing room and you're like, oh, they're showing the musicals.

241
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:01,175
Scott: Yeah.

242
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:07,429
Rym: But I think to your point, what's happening now partly is that American anime fans are starting to find out that these exist.

243
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,210
Rym: And I feel like the fandom of them is starting to grow, but it's still very niche.

244
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:21,489
Rym: So if you're a fan of Utena, the big news is that they are bringing it now because the Utena musicals tended to only cover basically season one.

245
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:23,569
Rym: They're doing Black Rose.

246
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:30,934
Rym: And they're right now they're releasing like the teasers and what the character is going to look like.

247
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:36,269
Rym: And I'll admit, I don't actually particularly like the Utena musicals.

248
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,256
Scott: I haven't actually seen any.

249
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:44,510
Scott: I haven't seen too much of any anime musical because I haven't had access or like put the effort in to get translated.

250
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:51,249
Rym: The problem is generally watching a musical on a screen tends to not be a great experience for a lot of reasons.

251
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:51,752
Scott: Yeah.

252
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:56,070
Scott: But I hope that, you know, we can get some translated ones.

253
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:01,226
Scott: But yeah, none of the ones that I have seen have been like things that I want to spend a lot of time on.

254
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:01,730
Rym: Yep.

255
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:13,369
Rym: So the Black Rose Arc Utena musical will be in Tokyo early July, and they've announced some of the cast members and there's a bunch of stuff going on.

256
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:14,828
Rym: So we'll see.

257
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:16,250
Rym: I'm just going to keep an eye on this.

258
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:25,390
Rym: And at some point, maybe I will watch a not great quality video of this musical and talk about it and some news that is only adjacent to the anime world.

259
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:32,270
Rym: But I think we need to talk about a little bit, as you are probably aware, that guy, Vic, who is a voice actor for a bunch of stuff.

260
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,590
Scott: Why do we keep talking about it?

261
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:41,389
Rym: We're talking about good people because they're all just continuing to do good stuff like Monica is just like she's casting, being cast for more anime and doing stuff.

262
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,730
Scott: But the news is basically interesting to say about good people.

263
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,616
Rym: Yeah, it's not just that.

264
00:13:47,716 --> 00:14:00,310
Rym: Vic is probably a creep, a large number of people have made allegations about his creepy harassing every interaction and, you know, time that I have seen him in my life.

265
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:03,329
Scott: I got a, you know, negative aura feeling.

266
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:12,792
Rym: I cannot say that I have witnessed him harass anyone, but I can say I've not witnessed him or have any specific memory of witnessing him doing something specifically bad.

267
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:16,790
Scott: I can say he was just a distasteful person to be around.

268
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,411
Scott: I did not.

269
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:27,730
Rym: I can say that while he was very nice to me directly and all the times I interacted with him, he was an absolute prick to the rest of my staff.

270
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:29,708
Rym: And I will leave it at that.

271
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:42,509
Rym: So the news was not just that this whole nonsense is going on, but that there's a huge brigade of Internet shitlords who have decided that he is their Elon Musk and they are going around harassing people.

272
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,929
Scott: Why can't I be someone's Elon Musk?

273
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:44,451
Rym: Yeah.

274
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:46,970
Rym: Do you want an army of shitlords on the Internet to do your bidding?

275
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,473
Scott: Yeah.

276
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:49,690
Scott: I'd send them to attack the other armies of shitlords.

277
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:52,329
Rym: That's like the toner wars.

278
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,689
Scott: I'd be like, I'd be like, all right, guys, here's what we're going to do.

279
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:01,990
Scott: You're going to find every single person who's, you know, doxxing people, you know, well, in order to defend Vic.

280
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,809
Rym: But Scott, who doxxes the doxxers?

281
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,251
Scott: That's right.

282
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:08,210
Scott: And doxx each and every one of them and send 10 pizzas to all the houses.

283
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:24,970
Rym: So the crazy part of this is that either Vic is stupid or gullible because he actually did sue like the people who are making allegations against him and funimation because his career is basically over.

284
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,470
Scott: The only conventions that are inviting him to do something else is not like he's going.

285
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,350
Scott: He's not criminally charged with anything.

286
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,209
Scott: He's not going to jail.

287
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,510
Scott: He just lost his job.

288
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,587
Scott: So go get a different job, bro.

289
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,191
Rym: Yeah.

290
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:36,129
Rym: Like being an anime voice actor.

291
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:45,910
Scott: Like if for some reason I was kicked out of the tech industry because I don't know, everyone stopped using the technology that I know and I didn't want to learn anything.

292
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:47,689
Scott: I just go do something else.

293
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,131
Rym: Yeah.

294
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:51,030
Rym: I think the problem is his career jobs left to do.

295
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,649
Scott: I would do them even if I had to work like, you know, some shitty job.

296
00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:03,250
Rym: His career seems to be based primarily on the like the shakings you can get from the pockets of the nerds who adore him at conventions.

297
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:09,510
Scott: Also, there are plenty of industries where like, you know, things are still really bad and no one gives a shit about sexual harassment.

298
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:18,992
Scott: And if you're a sexual harasser, you can just go work in one of those really old school industries where everyone's still a scumbag until we've weeded out those scumbags as well.

299
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:28,829
Rym: But in the voice acting world, not like what you're going to be a video game voice actor or an anime voice actor, because that's basically the horizon you've got if you're a voice acting B-lister.

300
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,350
Rym: Like what other industry needs voice acting?

301
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:43,690
Rym: You could do bit like jobber jobs for like an ad agency that does not pay a lot like that pays a per diem like here's four hundred bucks.

302
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,664
Rym: Read these lines.

303
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:45,030
Rym: Yeah.

304
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,110
Rym: Crusty the Clown style.

305
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:51,629
Scott: I'm sure Vic opened up a thing that was like, send me money and I'll do whatever you write, like the other people do.

306
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,545
Rym: Like John St.

307
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:52,670
Rym: John.

308
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,212
Rym: John St.

309
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:57,370
Rym: John was like the king of taking advantage of that in the correct way.

310
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,869
Scott: But the point is, I'm sure he would make a lot of money if he did that.

311
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:04,670
Rym: So basically, dude sued Funimation over all this.

312
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,609
Scott: With Funimation, which is now owned by Sony and has deep pockets.

313
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,270
Scott: Yeah, if I'm if I remember correctly, also sued a bunch of individual people.

314
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,109
Rym: And it's pretty crazy that this is happening.

315
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,989
Scott: You probably got some cuckoo bananas lawyer just like, you know, it was like a go fun me and all this nonsense.

316
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:32,342
Rym: So the best Twitter thread I saw was someone who said to to paraphrase as a lawyer, I believe that what's about to happen is that Vic is going to learn what happens during discovery.

317
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:32,810
Rym: That's right.

318
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:40,109
Rym: So Funimation, the news is that they actually finally reacted to this and they basically said this ain't happening.

319
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,204
Rym: You can write me a link to it.

320
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:42,809
Rym: That's the news.

321
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:58,191
Rym: So if you are in the anime world and you encounter this like mob of shitlords that are harassing people on Twitter because of it, I'm just going to point out that I found a list of the Twitter accounts that are doing

322
00:17:58,231 --> 00:17:58,452
Scott: this

323
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:01,223
Rym: and I added them to my Twitter block list.

324
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:10,673
Rym: So if you happen to subscribe to my Twitter block list, some sixty five hundred people will be blocked, including most of the people who are in this weird harassment brigade.

325
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:11,340
Scott: It's so weird.

326
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,460
Rym: It's like that's the crazy thing.

327
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,420
Scott: I was not but I would subscribe to your Twitter block list.

328
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,022
Scott: But for some reason, the way I use Twitter, I never see despite blocking basically almost nobody.

329
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:31,460
Scott: Yeah, I never see a almost I almost never see a tweet from anyone that I would block unless the only way is if I go looking for them.

330
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,041
Scott: Oh, I see.

331
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:37,997
Scott: But unless I do something like click on one of the president's tweets and look at the replies.

332
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,421
Scott: Yep.

333
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:44,405
Scott: So I basically see no bad tweets to block because I don't follow anyone shitty or reply to anyone shitty.

334
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:47,300
Scott: And because I'm a white dude, no one should he replies to me.

335
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:47,701
Rym: Yep.

336
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:53,563
Rym: But occasionally I will click on a tweet from like Planned Parenthood and I don't do that.

337
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,220
Rym: Yeah, but then I see those responses.

338
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:59,254
Rym: But also me and our good friend Adam have a friendly game going on.

339
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:03,020
Rym: of how many shitty people can we get banned from Twitter?

340
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:11,240
Rym: So every now and then, if I get bored, I'll click on like an AOC tweet and I'll just block and report everyone who replies.

341
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:18,640
Scott: See, when I see a good tweet like that from a person I know who has haters, I do not click to see the replies of the tweet because I know that there will be nothing useful.

342
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:19,282
Rym: Yep.

343
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:24,438
Rym: I basically only do it as a public service to the people who do encounter these harassment brigades.

344
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:32,099
Rym: And also because I have gotten a lot more people banned from Twitter than Adam and I'm winning that race and I want to stay ahead.

345
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:33,760
Scott: Well, I think you spend a lot more time on the Internet.

346
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:34,925
Rym: Yeah, I do.

347
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,440
Rym: So one last little, little news.

348
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:38,999
Rym: I love going to TCAF.

349
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,025
Rym: Emily used to go every year.

350
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:44,180
Rym: We didn't go this year because we're saving those vacation days to do a big Japan trip in the fall.

351
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:51,914
Rym: But I have a little more regret that I didn't go to TCAF this year because Junji Ito was there.

352
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,273
Scott: We, you know, we know we did some episodes about some Junji Ito works.

353
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:59,439
Rym: Junji Ito did a panel recently, like a normal panel.

354
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:05,480
Rym: He also did a panel where he live drew his horrifying art and talked about it.

355
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,236
Scott: It was basically like everyone who wants to draw horrifying Junji Ito art, you know, have a how to, which is pretty unavailable.

356
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:16,055
Rym: Luckily, this whole both of these panels are just on YouTube on.

357
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:19,940
Scott: this is why you regret not being there, because you can just fucking see it on YouTube.

358
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:23,620
Rym: Yeah, it would have been neat to see this in person because TCAF is a fun event.

359
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:28,680
Scott: And I'm glad that sharks with legs stay as far away from them as possible.

360
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,779
Rym: Yeah, but I guess I'll put it this way.

361
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:31,839
Rym: I really like the Penny Arcade Q&A.

362
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:33,859
Rym: Like that's one of the highlights of the packs for me.

363
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:35,939
Rym: Probably wouldn't watch it on YouTube.

364
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:38,870
Rym: No, there's something about Q&A's.

365
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,994
Scott: we were not at that.

366
00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:41,725
Scott: we could easily watch on Twitch.

367
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:42,417
Scott: that we just don't.

368
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,806
Rym: It's kind of like.

369
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:45,354
Rym: there are certain sporting events like.

370
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:46,320
Rym: I like hockey.

371
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,918
Rym: I don't watch every hockey game, but if I'm like if it's two teams I don't care about, I'm not going to watch it on TV.

372
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:02,019
Rym: But if I happen to get tickets to see two teams I don't care about, I will gladly go live and watch that hockey game like Sabres versus I don't know, the St.

373
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,440
Rym: Louis Blues, like, yeah, whatever.

374
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:06,240
Rym: I'll see that in person, but not Bill's Jets football.

375
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:11,219
Rym: That was the only sporting event I have ever just said fuck it and walked out of.

376
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:16,000
Rym: We left before halftime and we just drove.

377
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Scott: I don't know if it was before halftime, but it was early.

378
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,359
Scott: I think maybe it was halftime.

379
00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:21,540
Rym: I think we might have left like right around halftime.

380
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,699
Scott: We definitely just left.

381
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:31,277
Rym: Because I remember the moment because I remember like P was sitting there and even he was cold and I looked at you and I was like, should we should we really need?

382
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:32,778
Rym: do we really need to stay for this game?

383
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:35,479
Rym: And we all were like, no, we could just leave.

384
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,368
Rym: Fuck it.

385
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:48,010
Rym: But anyway, it's time for things of the day.

386
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,429
Rym: So our good friend Luke Burrage is a juggler.

387
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,208
Rym: He is a professional juggler.

388
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:56,490
Rym: He is in our forum arguing with all of you.

389
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,809
Rym: And you should go and argue with him because that's always a good time.

390
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:10,194
Rym: But there's been a genre of YouTube video lately that I'm a big fan of where you get an expert in a thing and have them tear apart movie depictions of the thing they're an expert in.

391
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,950
Rym: I like that genre video.

392
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,729
Rym: Like last night, I watched a really, really good one.

393
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:21,490
Rym: It was a CIA agent who is the head of disguise for the CIA for a long time.

394
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:25,950
Rym: And she broke down disguise shit in spy movies.

395
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,207
Scott: I saw a video yesterday where there was a former Navy SEAL who was doing.

396
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:32,569
Scott: he did a video about situational awareness.

397
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:39,935
Scott: But as a only a small portion of the video, he was reacting to stuff in the Bourne identity.

398
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:42,150
Scott: Oh, it wasn't that the whole video wasn't like react to movie.

399
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:43,609
Scott: It was just a small portion of the video.

400
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,770
Rym: Actually, I saw a similar one.

401
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:50,053
Rym: It was these FBI agents and they were like, here's the reality of trying to read someone's body language.

402
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:55,546
Rym: And it was really in depth because he was most of the things you think of, like, oh, people tend to touch their like.

403
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:55,930
Rym: none of that.

404
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,582
Rym: It's all bullshit.

405
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:56,909
Rym: Yeah.

406
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:03,081
Rym: But he talked about very specific things and what they mean and how you can use them to like tell a story.

407
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:03,829
Scott: I rubbed his hands together.

408
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,828
Scott: His hands must be cold.

409
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,013
Rym: Yep.

410
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:16,791
Rym: But there's one specific example of people who are confident in what they're saying or unafraid of answering a question if they bring their hands together, tend to do the Mr.

411
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:19,289
Rym: Burns thing or just like clasp their hands.

412
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,909
Rym: People who are nervous tend to interlock their fingers and rub them.

413
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:28,584
Rym: And there is some evidence about that's like a self soothing thing that that humans and monkeys both do.

414
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:30,870
Rym: And that was very specific.

415
00:23:31,473 --> 00:23:32,629
Scott: Do they know knowing this?

416
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:37,390
Scott: Then do they play the poison cup game of clasping fingers and confidently saying lies?

417
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:37,970
Rym: Yeah.

418
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:50,708
Rym: He only talked about how to spot other people and like and and also we talked a lot about how that information is not 100 percent and how it's just one tool in your toolkit to figure out if someone's lying to you.

419
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,029
Scott: But I think I can tell if someone's lying.

420
00:23:53,817 --> 00:23:54,829
Scott: Is there an AMRIM?

421
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:57,709
Rym: I rarely lie.

422
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,187
Rym: There's a lie right there.

423
00:24:00,491 --> 00:24:01,053
Rym: First one.

424
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:05,030
Rym: So our friend Luke does this for juggling in movies.

425
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:06,690
Rym: And I learned a lot watching this video.

426
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,649
Rym: This is actually really good.

427
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:14,268
Rym: The only thing I will warn you about is that he pronounces David Bowie's name in a very brightish way.

428
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,288
Rym: That's all I'm going to say about that.

429
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:20,300
Rym: So what do you got?

430
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,070
Scott: So, you know, there is this cat.

431
00:24:22,572 --> 00:24:24,730
Scott: It is a fictional cat, but it is a cute cat.

432
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:33,130
Scott: It is named Pusheen and Pusheen is doing a lot more action lately, like you think it's like, you know, Pusheen sort of had their day.

433
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:43,230
Scott: But no, Pusheen's popularity seems to only be increasing the activities of the Pusheen Corporation, as opposed to which I believe is in Chicago, as opposed to a viral video that suddenly gets famous.

434
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:48,689
Rym: Pusheen is this long, slow and steady smolder that just grows and grows and grows like.

435
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:56,794
Scott: a website was recently completely redone by our friends, Joe and Conrad, who have been on this podcast.

436
00:24:57,055 --> 00:25:08,510
Scott: I believe that they made the official new official Pusheen website, but that was like a month, some months ago already, just like yesterday or the day before Pusheen the cat opened its official YouTube channel.

437
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:11,350
Scott: And it is not just like new YouTube channel one video.

438
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,050
Scott: It's new YouTube channel, a lot of videos with more coming.

439
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:23,150
Scott: So if you don't want to follow Pusheen on like Instagram or Twitter or whatever, you can follow Pusheen on YouTube.

440
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:31,010
Scott: And there's the stuff that Pusheen has on YouTube is basically YouTube version, right, which is, I guess, better in some ways.

441
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,390
Scott: It has audio and more animation.

442
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:47,270
Rym: So in the moment, the Book Club book that we are going to talk about for the next Thursday show, Troy Dennings Pages of Pain, an officially licensed Dungeons and Dragons Planescape novel.

443
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:53,850
Scott: I from nineteen nineties something I'm actually something I'm really interested to.

444
00:25:54,332 --> 00:25:54,818
Rym: This is the 90s.

445
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:55,649
Rym: It's like ninety six.

446
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,196
Scott: It feels like 90s.

447
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:56,358
Scott: Yeah.

448
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:04,529
Rym: I'm really interested to do this show because the difference between you and I, because we both went into it knowing, yeah, this is a D&D book.

449
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:08,790
Rym: I had read it once before, but my memory was it's the best.

450
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:12,685
Scott: I think it's the only maybe the only I think the only one.

451
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,810
Rym: it's only one you should even consider reading.

452
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,573
Scott: Well, I think I would say it's the only D&D book I ever read, but that's actually not true.

453
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:24,150
Scott: I had a. I don't know if it was D&D, but it was TSR.

454
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,293
Scott: It was a TSR.

455
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:30,714
Scott: choose your own adventure book, which gets into a mech suit and is the president.

456
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:32,650
Rym: I don't know.

457
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:34,709
Rym: I don't know which one that might still have it.

458
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,570
Rym: I don't know because there's a bunch of those kinds of things anyway.

459
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:52,664
Rym: But I'm really curious because the the only difference between you and I reading this book is that I know a lot about the Planescape setting, or at least I knew a lot about the Planescape setting as it existed in the 90s.

460
00:26:54,030 --> 00:27:03,450
Scott: I know about Planescape from playing Planescape torment once, but sort of cheating and not paying too much attention now and also absorbing being around nerds.

461
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,689
Scott: You talked about Planescape a lot.

462
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,770
Scott: Yup, but that's I never read a Planescape.

463
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,350
Rym: You knew the lady of pain was the sword head lady.

464
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,930
Scott: Yes, I never read a Planescape source book or anything like that.

465
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,191
Rym: Yup.

466
00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:20,509
Scott: So the cool thing is, you know, actually we played one of the forum games he played was technically a Planescape game.

467
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,090
Rym: Yeah, maybe that was the one where I was the little dragon guy, the Mind Flayer.

468
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,290
Rym: Yeah, you were the Mind Flayer.

469
00:27:25,391 --> 00:27:26,970
Rym: OK, that was a Planescape game.

470
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,457
Scott: All right.

471
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:28,049
Scott: There you go.

472
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,069
Rym: Yeah, that was that was my Planescape experience.

473
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,060
Rym: Yeah, Planescape.

474
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:31,730
Rym: All right.

475
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:37,670
Rym: I've always wanted to play Planescape games, but my group in high school was much more invested.

476
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:38,490
Scott: Forgot 10 Realms.

477
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,669
Scott: Forgot 10 Realms is just one realm.

478
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,645
Rym: Yeah, Forgot Realms is just one realm.

479
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,369
Scott: You're also in Planescape, right?

480
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:46,190
Rym: Well, yes, everything is in Planescape.

481
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:46,630
Rym: That's right.

482
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,929
Rym: Except Ravenloft is sharted off at its own thing.

483
00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:54,970
Rym: And Dark Sun is also cut off from the multiverse for its own reasons.

484
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,523
Scott: Uh huh.

485
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,050
Scott: And let's just make a heretical D&D game where you go there anyway.

486
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,068
Rym: No, you're not allowed to.

487
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:01,129
Scott: Stop me.

488
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,190
Rym: Gary Gygax will come back from the dead and get you.

489
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:03,829
Scott: Let's do it.

490
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,769
Scott: We want to resurrect him.

491
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:06,490
Scott: Yeah, we could use it.

492
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:13,929
Scott: We'd be like, dudes, we just played a D&D game and we opened a portal from Sigil to It's pronounced Sigil.

493
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,609
Scott: Whatever, to Ravenloft.

494
00:28:15,771 --> 00:28:17,089
Scott: And we mispronounced Sigil.

495
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,050
Scott: And that got Gary Gygax so mad that he came back from the dead.

496
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,530
Scott: Check out the zombie Gary Gygax.

497
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:26,730
Scott: He's running our game now to prevent us from doing these heretical things and making sure our pronunciation is correct.

498
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,390
Rym: Oh, what are the not-hobbits, the Dragonlance ones?

499
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,088
Scott: Halflings?

500
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:32,268
Scott: No, I don't know.

501
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:33,729
Rym: Kender, Kender.

502
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,509
Scott: It's the we'll have a game.

503
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,549
Scott: I have heard that word before.

504
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,750
Rym: So Kender are basically, they're only a dragon.

505
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,809
Scott: That is a word I have heard.

506
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:45,589
Rym: So Dragonlance are also technically a D&D setting, but that's even worse.

507
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:51,830
Rym: But I don't think that's in the modern cosmology of Planescape anyway.

508
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,550
Rym: But they had their own version of halflings that were a hundred times more annoying.

509
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:58,769
Rym: And they're best not spoken of.

510
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,390
Rym: We'll have both Kender and halflings.

511
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,030
Rym: You know what?

512
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,630
Rym: We'll even have some gnomes and some quarterlings in this game.

513
00:29:04,932 --> 00:29:05,208
Scott: And hobbits.

514
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,122
Rym: Hobbitses.

515
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,410
Rym: All right.

516
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,108
Rym: You want to get into this?

517
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:09,989
Rym: We got any other meta?

518
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:10,669
Rym: We got no cons.

519
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,123
Rym: So PAX.

520
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,750
Rym: PAX ain't sold out yet, but Friday is going to sell out pretty soon, I think.

521
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,569
Scott: Well Saturday's sold out.

522
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,068
Scott: Sunday's almost sold out.

523
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,830
Scott: The full day, a full weekend passes.

524
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,250
Scott: This is PAX West in Seattle, by the way, on Labor Day weekend.

525
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:24,923
Rym: Yep.

526
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:32,810
Rym: The problem is with PAX is that they keep moving and moving to the point that they're all clustered like one after the other.

527
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,770
Scott: So basically we don't have... Well, basically not in the summer, right?

528
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:39,870
Scott: So as soon as you get through with summer, it's like Labor Day, PAX, then you got Unplugged in Australia.

529
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,963
Rym: October, October, PAX OSS, November, PAX Unplugged, early January, PAX South.

530
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,090
Rym: And then right away, like late February, early March, maybe April, PAX East.

531
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:50,329
Scott: And then summer.

532
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:50,899
Rym: Yep.

533
00:29:52,671 --> 00:30:00,650
Rym: It's annoying in one sense in that we used to have this cycle of like write a bunch of panels and then do a PAX, and we have some time to be like, "Okay, what was good?

534
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,241
Rym: Let's shift it

535
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:01,385
Rym: up.".

536
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:06,709
Rym: Now I get to write all the panels for all the PAXes in one go and submit them all at the same time.

537
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,629
Rym: It's getting... It's moderate.

538
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,510
Rym: It's not stressful, but it is annoying.

539
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,570
Rym: But I don't know if I want more PAXes or I just want the existing PAXes to spread out.

540
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,949
Scott: If there's enough PAXes, I can get them to pay me an equipment job.

541
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:21,070
Rym: If there was one PAX a month, I think I could turn that into a living.

542
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,129
Rym: So, gunsmith cats.

543
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:34,150
Scott: So way back at the RIT Anime Club, right, in like one of the first... No, this is the first, but one of the first showings we went to was this anime.

544
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,230
Scott: This was before we ran the RIT Anime Club.

545
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,950
Scott: That was the last time I saw this before yesterday.

546
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:39,220
Scott: Yep.

547
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:42,989
Scott: And so that was like, what, 20 years ago.

548
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:49,230
Rym: This OAV came out in like '96, so I was a freshman in high school.

549
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,769
Rym: So I didn't see it until the year 2000 when we went to RIT.

550
00:30:53,730 --> 00:31:03,450
Scott: And all I remember watching it was, there was the girl with guns, the car, the girl with a bunch of grenades, and it was just sort of crazy and ridiculous.

551
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,170
Scott: And watching it in a big group, it was a lot of fun and people got real excited.

552
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:08,402
Scott: Yep.

553
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,489
Rym: The crowd went crazy.

554
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,870
Rym: It was only three episodes.

555
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,929
Scott: Everyone, people were laughing hysterically at certain parts.

556
00:31:13,112 --> 00:31:14,330
Rym: Yep, it was only three episodes.

557
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,810
Rym: It's pretty well animated, like it had a pretty high production value for like the era.

558
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:19,910
Rym: Like it looks good.

559
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:20,623
Rym: Like a lot of that...

560
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:29,710
Scott: So much more recently, Dark Horse released all of the manga, Gunsmith Cats and Gunsmith Cats Burst, and I bought it all and read it all.

561
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,870
Scott: I don't know if I kept any of it, I may or may not.

562
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:35,510
Scott: If I do have it, it's on one of my back shelves hiding behind other manga.

563
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,650
Rym: Yep, I never actually read the manga, but... And you know what?

564
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,730
Scott: Even though I read absolutely all of it, I remember almost none of it, basically.

565
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:44,606
Scott: Yeah.

566
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:45,930
Scott: It was not memorable.

567
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,484
Scott: And anyway, there's also...

568
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:57,710
Rym: I remember the OAV more of it than I expected, because what I remembered before we watched it again was in the first episode, she does a cool ricochet thing with a shotgun.

569
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:05,429
Rym: In the second episode, that Russian Spetsnaz lady fucking murders everybody, and she has a gun knife, which is a real thing.

570
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:11,369
Rym: And the third episode is a little spooky, and it gets a little dire toward the end, and people die.

571
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:13,240
Scott: And then...

572
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:15,610
Rym: I also remembered she had the Shelby Cobra.

573
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,127
Scott: Right.

574
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,110
Scott: So there's this related thing called, like, Bean Bandit.

575
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,638
Scott: Riding Bean.

576
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:28,950
Scott: Which is a character, Bean Bandit, who is in the manga and is not in this anime, but he has his own spin-off anime, which is just a movie, called Riding Bean.

577
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,289
Rym: I have not seen Riding Bean since I was in high school.

578
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,910
Scott: I watched the Riding Bean anime VHS from the RIT Anime Club.

579
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,769
Scott: I took it out of the library, and I watched it once, and then I returned it.

580
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,170
Rym: I want to say I rented it from Blockbuster.

581
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,289
Scott: I don't remember much of it.

582
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,430
Rym: Pretty sure I got it from Blockbuster Video.

583
00:32:45,930 --> 00:33:00,870
Scott: All of these things were made by a man named Kinichi Tsunoda, so what you have to know about this guy, is this is a guy, this is a Japanese dude, right, who I don't know how significant he is in Japan, right?

584
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:15,310
Scott: It seems like... It seems like he had his day in Japan, where he was big, and like, his manga was big enough to be animated, right, into movies and OAVs, but it seems like he was bigger in America, at least compared to other manga artists.

585
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:25,790
Rym: Which I think partly because Riding Bean and Gunsmith Cats came out at two, like, big inflection points for American anime fandom, and got, for the time, pretty wide releases.

586
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,210
Scott: Well, I think it's also, I know he definitely came to conventions here and made appearances and stuff.

587
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,060
Scott: I don't know how much...

588
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,330
Rym: People cosplaying as Riley Vincent at early Otakobs.

589
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:43,730
Scott: But also, this dude, maybe he's part of the reason he was coming to America and doing, you know, and stuff like this, is because this guy's America fanboy.

590
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:53,730
Scott: He loves cars, he loves guns, he loves American cars, yes, he loves boobs, and butts, and naked ladies, right?

591
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,368
Scott: That's the kind of guy he is.

592
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:01,290
Rym: And weird, technically, she's 30 years old nonsense, he's a problematic figure.

593
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:17,947
Scott: So, if you look at the manga and the anime, like, you know, the guns are so perfectly illustrated down to the tiniest detail modeled after real guns, the Shelby Cobra is drawn in, like, ridiculously higher resolution infidelity, but unlike Initial D, the characters are also drawn well.

594
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:18,440
Scott: Right.

595
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:31,690
Scott: The characters are drawn well, but still much less than the car, and it seems like most of the work he's had in the anime industry, other than the things he's worked on that were his original works, were basically character design for other things.

596
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,810
Scott: He hasn't, you know, done a lot of original stuff.

597
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:37,530
Scott: Also, it seems like he hasn't done anything at all in a large number of years.

598
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,010
Rym: So, I know what he's up to.

599
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,310
Scott: And according to Wikipedia, he's working at his family's candy store.

600
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:52,909
Rym: Yup, by adding lemon peels to his family's existing candies, and providing his own bishoujo illustrations for the packaging, he's up to his same bullshit.

601
00:34:53,251 --> 00:35:00,269
Scott: Right, but it's like, the point is, he, you know, it was a guy who had his moment in the sun, and went away.

602
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,870
Rym: What a Wikipedia article.

603
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:09,570
Rym: His personal life section says, and I quote, Sonora is a self-confessed gun fanatic, owning several replica guns.

604
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,350
Scott: Right, because he can't have real ones in Japan, right?

605
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,830
Rym: Yeah, but that is a sentence for a Wikipedia article.

606
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,449
Scott: I think he's also done-

607
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,990
Rym: He worked on, like, Doll Force, and Bubble Gum stuff-

608
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:30,030
Scott: I don't know if this is true, but I get the- because there was also another guy who did this, I forget his name, but I think he's also done, like, American comic stuff a little bit, maybe.

609
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:30,890
Scott: Anyway.

610
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:31,319
Scott: Yeah.

611
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:43,608
Scott: But yeah, there are other people who know a lot more about this guy, and can probably talk for hours about, you know, what the deal with him is, but you have to know about this dude to understand this work, right?

612
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,309
Rym: Now, one thing I would say is, we're going to focus on the OAV, because- That's what I watched yesterday.

613
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:54,110
Rym: Yes, you do not need to know anything about the Gunsmith Cats universe to watch that OAV.

614
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,350
Scott: Right, if you read the Gunsmith Cats manga, you will get the full story of Gunsmith Cats.

615
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,530
Rym: Because it was originally just the Gunsmith Cat.

616
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:05,709
Scott: Who are these people, how did they get together, how did they get in this business, what their deal is.

617
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,969
Rym: That is less interesting than the OAV.

618
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:08,530
Rym: Right.

619
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,730
Scott: You'll also, in the manga, get some really bad stuff, right?

620
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,067
Scott: So if you don't know the girl, Minnie May, right?

621
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:20,050
Scott: She is, in the manga, you will learn, she is actually like a teenager, basically.

622
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:28,689
Scott: And in the anime, in the first episode, there's a very short scene where she looks at a photo of a dude longingly, and they don't mention that dude again.

623
00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:34,230
Scott: In the manga, that dude is her boyfriend, he's there, he's way old, and she's a teenager, and it's totally fucked up.

624
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,566
Rym: Doesn't she like take drugs to keep herself young?

625
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:40,670
Rym: I don't know about that, I don't remember, but- There's weird shit with her.

626
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:45,450
Scott: It is interesting that the boyfriend's name is Ken, and the guy we just talked about who's.

627
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,286
Scott: the creator is Ken "Ichi" Sonoda.

628
00:36:49,931 --> 00:37:00,410
Rym: Oh my god, yes, May is tiny and young, appearing for her age, having taken growth-stunting drugs in an effort to stay attractive to Ken, the aforementioned guy.

629
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,361
Rym: She can pass for a child of ten or tw-.

630
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:03,670
Rym: Don't read the manga.

631
00:37:04,275 --> 00:37:04,666
Scott: I read it.

632
00:37:05,354 --> 00:37:06,470
Rym: Do not read the manga.

633
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,668
Scott: I don't know if I still have it, though.

634
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,036
Rym: Yeah.

635
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:15,549
Scott: Uh, but yeah, other than like the creepy facts like that, though the manga is basically just a lot like these OAVs, only just more of it.

636
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,578
Rym: But the beauty of the OAV is that

637
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:18,220
Scott: a lot

638
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:40,906
Rym: of 90s anime have this dynamic of there's a bunch of characters, and you kind of figure out their deal insofar as it matters instantly, and you just have this story with a whole bunch of characters that all play their part, and watching Gunsmith Cats again really reminded me, it's not the best anime, it's got a lot of flaws, but it reminded me of all the things I really liked about these 90s OAVs.

639
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:47,270
Scott: I mean, this OAV, even though it's three episodes, it's actually just a movie.

640
00:37:47,450 --> 00:38:02,750
Scott: It's not a movie like top-tier movie when you think of anime movies, but it is 90 minutes of animation with one contiguous story that just happens to be chopped up into three acts with an opener and a closer between separating the acts.

641
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,350
Rym: The opener is basically the Cowboy Bebop opener.

642
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,490
Scott: Or the Cowboy Bebop opener is the Guns for the Cats opener.

643
00:38:08,991 --> 00:38:14,090
Scott: It's jazz music with colors and panning and, you know, three dramatic guns.

644
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:18,348
Scott: If you cut out the opener's enclosures and pasted all three of these together, it would be a movie.

645
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:19,087
Rym: Yup.

646
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,510
Scott: Like a made-for-TV-movie quality level, right?

647
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,010
Scott: Not like a, you know, movie, cinema movie quality movie.

648
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,130
Rym: So what is this movie?

649
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:31,842
Rym: It is basically, we're in the city of Chicago, and there are these two women who run a gun shop.

650
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,488
Scott: Yup.

651
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,310
Scott: They're also bounty hunters.

652
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:34,665
Rym: Yes.

653
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,670
Rym: They are bounty hunters.

654
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:36,989
Rym: They run a gun shop.

655
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,910
Rym: The gun shop is perfectly legal and like regulated gun stuff.

656
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,029
Rym: Like their customers are cops because that's just how it is.

657
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:52,130
Rym: But they also have a large collection of extremely illegal firearms to support their bounty hunting.

658
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:56,690
Scott: Well, also because, you know, she's a gun nut because the author is a gun nut.

659
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:56,910
Scott: Yeah.

660
00:38:57,231 --> 00:39:01,830
Rym: The main character is a hyper competent gun nut who knows her shit.

661
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:02,728
Rym: Also a car nut.

662
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,120
Rym: Yup.

663
00:39:03,411 --> 00:39:05,870
Rym: Private investigator drives a Shelby Cobra.

664
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:10,389
Rym: If you don't know what a Shelby Cobra is, it's a very rare and special car.

665
00:39:10,772 --> 00:39:12,489
Scott: It's a very American muscle car.

666
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:12,987
Scott: Yup.

667
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:14,407
Rym: There aren't many of them.

668
00:39:14,872 --> 00:39:15,630
Scott: There's enough.

669
00:39:16,357 --> 00:39:17,130
Scott: It's not ultra rare.

670
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:17,446
Rym: Yeah.

671
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:18,349
Rym: But it's pretty rare.

672
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,901
Rym: If you got money, you can get one.

673
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,930
Rym: There are a lot of adjacent cars, but the Cobra was a rare one.

674
00:39:24,511 --> 00:39:33,590
Rym: Anyway, her partner is basically an explosives expert in the same vein as movies like Predator.

675
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,490
Rym: You have the team and there's always the one on the team.

676
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,050
Scott: Well, it's like Team Fortress.

677
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,930
Scott: You got Gunperson and Demoman.

678
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:40,418
Rym: Yup.

679
00:39:41,475 --> 00:39:42,750
Scott: You see a gun and Demoman.

680
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:51,430
Rym: So like the running gag will be, there'll be a tense scene and Riley has a pistol or something and like gunfights and Mini May will just fucking blow up the building.

681
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:58,970
Scott: She usually uses flash bangs and smoke grenades and is super clumsy with them and only uses Not clumsy, careless.

682
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:03,150
Scott: Yes, but the explosives are usually reserved for traps when they're far away from them.

683
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,430
Scott: She's throwing usually flash bangs and smoke.

684
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,522
Rym: A lot of the jokes, like the throwaway games come down to.

685
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:16,249
Rym: Riley's got a gun and she's like looking down a stairway and then Mini May kind of slides up behind her just holding a fist full of grenades.

686
00:40:17,353 --> 00:40:18,730
Scott: That's when the anime club got excited.

687
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:19,153
Rym: Yup.

688
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:21,429
Rym: And then you get the long distance shot.

689
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:26,010
Rym: You see the house like way in the background, you just hear a pop and then smoke comes out the window.

690
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:26,565
Scott: Yup.

691
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:27,768
Rym: That kind of stuff.

692
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:34,670
Scott: So the movie, these three episodes are, you know, they're not telling you any of the plot of the characters.

693
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,210
Scott: There's no real character development or anything that happens here.

694
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:41,109
Scott: They're assuming that you already read the manga or you don't have to have, right?

695
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:45,330
Scott: But they don't bother introducing the characters very much, although you'll get it right away.

696
00:40:45,636 --> 00:40:45,750
Scott: Yup.

697
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:47,429
Scott: It's just a side story.

698
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:49,570
Scott: I don't believe this story was in the manga at all.

699
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,070
Scott: It's like a complete side story, the same sort of like a cowboy bebop movie, right?

700
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,568
Scott: It's just like a side story doesn't interfere, right?

701
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,330
Scott: You could insert it pretty much anywhere into the into the main plot.

702
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:10,508
Scott: You know, it's like is a bad guy is the story of them, you know, dealing with the bad guy, the ATF agent, the cops, you know, the Russian, the whole situation, right?

703
00:41:11,331 --> 00:41:16,547
Scott: And then resolving it over the course of, you know, 90 minutes, then the end back to status quo.

704
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:17,950
Rym: And it has a pretty good progression.

705
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,310
Rym: Like the three acts work pretty well.

706
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:29,430
Rym: Like act one is basically the somewhat silly plot where they get roped into some hijinks and the cops sort of extort them into helping the cops with this dangerous investigation.

707
00:41:29,793 --> 00:41:29,910
Scott: Yup.

708
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:31,268
Rym: And it's mostly funny.

709
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:35,750
Rym: And then act two is like, oh, there's something bigger going on.

710
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,430
Rym: This Russian like former Spetsnaz person.

711
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:45,670
Scott: They thought they took care of it in episode one, but no episode two, actually, this is a much bigger deal and you don't want to be involved.

712
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:49,950
Scott: But now you sort of are being forced to and a big shootout thing happens.

713
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:50,310
Rym: Yeah.

714
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:53,510
Rym: It's a big shootout and a little bit of a. I'm too old for this shit.

715
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:54,010
Scott: Yup.

716
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,730
Rym: And then act three is no, this is dire and people are going to die.

717
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:03,550
Scott: That crazy Russian person who you shot at and is upset and is now coming after you.

718
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:05,890
Scott: And also the big boss has been revealed.

719
00:42:06,434 --> 00:42:07,469
Scott: The end episode three.

720
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:10,089
Rym: And it holds up pretty well.

721
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,810
Rym: Like if you're an anime fan, it's worth watching.

722
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,729
Rym: It's just on YouTube.

723
00:42:14,094 --> 00:42:15,287
Rym: You could just go watch it right now.

724
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:17,410
Scott: Well, it's on YouTube illegally.

725
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:24,870
Scott: But yeah, the things, you know, that are positive about it, if you really like illustrations of guns and cars.

726
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,220
Rym: Yup.

727
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,510
Scott: But, you know, there's also parts of the gun.

728
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:34,569
Scott: There are also lots of scenes where there are just excuses for characters to have a lot less clothes on than otherwise.

729
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:43,030
Rym: But what's funny and Dave Riley said this a bunch of times in the past, but it's almost wholesome compared to what that kind of fan service is in the modern era.

730
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:43,689
Rym: That's true.

731
00:42:43,951 --> 00:42:45,108
Scott: Also, some of the scenes.

732
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,650
Scott: For example, it's like these two girls living together in a house.

733
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:48,969
Scott: Right.

734
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:55,030
Scott: So for them to be like sitting in the kitchen table wearing only their underwear talking is like I feel like normal.

735
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:55,493
Scott: That's like.

736
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,629
Scott: that's how I live my life.

737
00:42:56,714 --> 00:42:56,870
Scott: Right.

738
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:57,990
Scott: It's like that seems normal.

739
00:42:58,112 --> 00:42:59,209
Scott: And they're just illustrating it.

740
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:06,150
Scott: You know, they're just happen to be have, you know, stereotypically sexy bodies or whatever, wearing sexy underwear.

741
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:14,030
Scott: But like every scene that's most egregious is an episode two where the bad guy attacks by using the warehouse crane hook.

742
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:14,381
Rym: Yeah.

743
00:43:14,653 --> 00:43:14,744
Rym: Yeah.

744
00:43:15,033 --> 00:43:16,049
Rym: I was going to bring that up.

745
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:16,908
Scott: And it happens.

746
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:30,110
Scott: A giant hook is being is swinging at this woman and it just so just so happens to tear her shirt open right down the middle and tear her bra open right down the middle.

747
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,630
Rym: Nineties anime, ladies and gentlemen, it's a giant hook.

748
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,859
Scott: It's not like some, you know, it's like really.

749
00:43:36,361 --> 00:43:38,109
Scott: it's not like a sword slash cutting the open.

750
00:43:38,852 --> 00:43:40,939
Rym: But the other like the good.

751
00:43:41,381 --> 00:43:45,850
Rym: positive aspect of the thing about it is that it's set in Chicago and they did their research.

752
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:51,500
Scott: It is like, well, because he's and you know, this guy is a fanboy of guns, cars, America, boobs.

753
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,629
Scott: Well, crime is like, yeah, Chicago.

754
00:43:53,830 --> 00:44:04,829
Rym: So the anime was adapted by Takeshi Mori, who, according to this article, didn't know anything about guns at all, but knew a lot about cars.

755
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:13,270
Rym: So they actually took some of the production crew to go to Chicago to scout locations, to get backgrounds, to do research.

756
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:18,370
Rym: They actually visited gun shops and they went to a police academy and got firearms training.

757
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,949
Rym: And then they use that to make the anime.

758
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:21,870
Scott: Trying hard.

759
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:22,484
Rym: Yep.

760
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:29,168
Rym: And they actually went so far as to get a Shelby Cobra GT500 and record the sound effects for the anime.

761
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:30,810
Scott: They didn't buy the car.

762
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,489
Scott: They just found someone who let them listen to it.

763
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:32,721
Rym: Yeah.

764
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,550
Rym: And they got the sound effects and made it legit.

765
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,209
Scott: I was going to say.

766
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,370
Rym: And it's funny because half the gunplay is very noir.

767
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,030
Rym: Like goons just fall over instantly dead.

768
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,249
Rym: You don't see a lot of blood or any blood.

769
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:49,030
Rym: But then a few moments are much more realistic about the guns.

770
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:55,930
Rym: Like it's a weird thing to point out, but ricochets are hyper realistic for some reason.

771
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,090
Rym: But the noir stuff is just John Wick style.

772
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,629
Rym: A hundred Russians die.

773
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:03,670
Rym: The gunfights are really fun though.

774
00:45:03,851 --> 00:45:08,161
Rym: They're more interesting than most of the noir gunfights, I would say after episode four of noir.

775
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:09,250
Scott: Yeah.

776
00:45:10,432 --> 00:45:16,162
Scott: If you want a nostalgia trip back to 90s anime, if you don't mind some of the negative parts of 90s anime.

777
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:27,930
Rym: If you want to see like in a really tight example of what popular 90s anime was like, this is like, this is the shortest path to experiencing that.

778
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:37,570
Scott: You can also learn about this Kinichi Tsunoda guy who was important/infamous in a time and a place in this really narrow.

779
00:45:38,031 --> 00:45:41,950
Scott: It's like a really big fish in this tiny pond for a period of time.

780
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:49,309
Scott: You know, I guess we'll be remembered by some anime nerds and then, you know, it feels like we'll be forgotten at some point.

781
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:56,389
Rym: Every now and then some nerds like us will do a panel at a random anime convention talking about, so you ever heard of this guy?

782
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:58,462
Rym: Let's talk about this guy.

783
00:45:58,522 --> 00:45:59,348
Rym: none of you have heard of.

784
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,190
Rym: But I now kind of have this itch I need to scratch.

785
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,070
Rym: I kind of want to watch like Bubblegum Crisis again.

786
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:10,790
Scott: But you did character design for that, right?

787
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:11,126
Scott: Yeah.

788
00:46:11,752 --> 00:46:14,870
Rym: But like that 90s anime, like I'm starting to feel it again.

789
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:17,069
Scott: Bubblegum Crisis I think is much better than this.

790
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,810
Rym: Yeah, but Bubblegum Crisis is also not great.

791
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,269
Scott: No, it just is better than this.

792
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:21,562
Scott: Yep.

793
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,808
Scott: This means great.

794
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:26,809
Rym: The only real important part of Bubblegum Crisis is that the 80 police suck.

795
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:27,700
Rym: Yeah.

796
00:46:34,743 --> 00:46:36,880
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

797
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:42,000
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.

798
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,420
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

799
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,360
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

800
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:55,100
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

802
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,920
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

803
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,040
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

804
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:17,580
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this Gunsmith Cats episode of GeekNights.

805
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:23,240
Rym: Let me go into my Patreon manager here, because as you know, I record this all in one go.

806
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:23,838
Rym: No edits.

807
00:47:24,724 --> 00:47:26,159
Rym: No, once I record, it just happens.

808
00:47:26,962 --> 00:47:30,420
Rym: And the Patreon website is actually being really slow right now, which is annoying.

809
00:47:30,883 --> 00:47:31,297
Rym: Here we go.

810
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:31,995
