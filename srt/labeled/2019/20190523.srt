00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,000
Scott:

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,407
Rym: It's Thursday May 23rd 2019.

3
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:15,900
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight not late to this party at all.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,515
Rym: We are reviewing the 1999 film The Matrix 20th anniversary.

5
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:23,219
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:30,649
Rym: So yeah, it's a nice out finally biking to work like every day except today Except today.

7
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:35,460
Rym: and it was funny cuz I got up and I was like oh I should bike to work and I look outside and it has that look of it.

8
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:38,738
Scott: I already knew I wasn't gonna bike to work today cuz a I was going to the doctor after.

9
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:39,563
Scott: yeah I'm sort of.

10
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,878
Scott: I left work early go to the doctor and then came here.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,540
Scott: But be I checked the weather religiously like all the fucking time that I knew it was gonna rain today.

12
00:00:47,662 --> 00:00:57,012
Rym: Yep, so I'm at work and of course the problem was it was only raining while I would have had to bike to work and then it was like sunny and Nice for most of the day and then it was rainy again.

13
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,780
Rym: right as I would have by tome.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,487
Rym: It only rained at the times.

15
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:01,431
Rym: I would have been biking.

16
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:02,355
Scott: That's when it likes to rain.

17
00:01:02,777 --> 00:01:04,462
Rym: I know it knows It's like us.

18
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:05,447
Rym: Rym got his bike out.

19
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:08,277
Rym: Hahaha Zeus and Poseidon are both just like.

20
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:08,959
Rym: yeah, fuck him up.

21
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:12,439
Rym: So I was thinking of Poseidon because the pages of pain.

22
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:16,259
Scott: I've not read any more painful pages since we last.

23
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:20,333
Rym: So all I will say about that is that I had all the painful.

24
00:01:20,434 --> 00:01:21,418
Rym: I know but I'm real.

25
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:25,471
Rym: near the end I hit the point where I remember the first time I read the book.

26
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:34,220
Rym: it kind of accelerates like the last bit is one long And I kind of just read that in one go as a kid because I was just like what the fuck is going.

27
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:42,392
Rym: Oh and all the bad all the really bad things just happened like one after another And I forgot about something pretty horrifying that happened.

28
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:43,917
Scott: I'm sure many harv.

29
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,740
Scott: It's the pages of pain.

30
00:01:44,780 --> 00:02:02,030
Rym: it's not the pages so pleasant if the if the to Sally if the hands getting cut off is like a level for painful and The foot thing like that's maybe a level six this is like Seems like it's ten and then you realize it's eleven.

31
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,823
Rym: and that ain't even the worst thing that happens in this bike cut off to Replace a nose.

32
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:07,189
Rym: It's pretty worse than you.

33
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:08,151
Rym: It's pretty bad.

34
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:09,056
Rym: It's pretty gruesome.

35
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:12,148
Rym: It's uh It's painful pages are happening here.

36
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:24,760
Rym: All right, but the one thing I can say about biking is that because I ride a hybrid like a Performance hybrid bike kind of the way I've ridden mountain bikes my whole life.

37
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:29,719
Rym: I actually took the time to fully inspect my my rear cassettes actually a really good shape.

38
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:35,620
Rym: My chain is stretched to a laughable degree Because I haven't been doing anything.

39
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:37,179
Rym: I've been not maintaining my chain for shit.

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,584
Scott: Apparently what what's supposed?

41
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:41,394
Scott: the deal is right is you have a chain and the cassette and it.

42
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,140
Scott: the chain gets stretched over time Yeah, and then that will erode the cassette.

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,620
Scott: So usually you want to replace them together and just even though a cassette looks like it would be an expensive part.

44
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:50,367
Scott: It's really not.

45
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:51,800
Scott: It's just a bunch of gears in a stack.

46
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,420
Rym: It's kind of a pain to replace it, but I'll have the bike shop do it.

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,628
Rym: They charge like nothing to do that.

48
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:56,373
Scott: It's not actually that hard.

49
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:57,380
Scott: But anyway, it's not hard.

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,311
Rym: It's just annoying because I don't have a lift like put my bike.

51
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:02,340
Scott: is that if you replace your chain?

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:14,388
Scott: When it gets stretched and the cassette is still in good shape a plus Yes you can usually get a new chain on there and get two chains per cassette and that is what you do if you're a Responsible bike owner who doesn't?

53
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,540
Scott: but it's a regular set are mismatched.

54
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:20,800
Scott: What happens is like the chain will slip over the gears.

55
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:33,800
Scott: It's like you'll pedal and like the chain is spinning around But it like over the gears of the cassettes over the spikes and it goes like That'll happen if the cassette is bad or the chain is bad, right?

56
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,531
Scott: And that's what you're trying to avoid.

57
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:39,642
Rym: or if the chain is bad But the cassette is brand new and perfect You'll get the opposite.

58
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:50,740
Rym: the chain will stay in the gears around the corner usually on the front and then pull up behind And loop under itself and that just causes an instant faceplant.

59
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:56,120
Rym: Yeah, like it is it's called chainsaw and I'm afraid more more afraid of that than I am of terrorists.

60
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:59,237
Scott: I mean, you could just be afraid of like a stick in the wheel.

61
00:03:59,257 --> 00:04:02,188
Rym: Yeah I'm more afraid of chainsaw because stick in the wheel.

62
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:11,040
Rym: I assume if a stick goes into my wheel Someone did it on purpose and I probably am aware that I have an enemy who's attempting to do this to me.

63
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:16,180
Rym: I doubt a random hobo is gonna stick out like a broom through my spokes randomly on the street.

64
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,789
Rym: I'm more afraid of chainsaw than I am Just push people on the subway tracks.

65
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,411
Rym: That is true.

66
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:28,366
Rym: That is in fact true I encountered a really really aggressive hobo yesterday actually, okay But they didn't like it wasn't?

67
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:31,520
Rym: it wasn't even on the level of worth talking about on GeekNights.

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,785
Rym: It's just I thought of it just now.

69
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,460
Rym: it was below the gutter punk who threatened to stab me in Portland.

70
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:44,479
Rym: Hmm, which that's now the bar I won't talk about a hobo unless they're above the line of had a knife at my back and threatened to stab me with it.

71
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,374
Rym: Okay So, uh, I love all our friends in the West Coast are like, oh you're in that Riverside Park Park.

72
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:51,317
Rym: Yeah, that'll happen there.

73
00:04:51,337 --> 00:05:08,304
Rym: Okay but But the last thing I'll say about biking is now that I'm biking to work every day I'm reminded of one of the most painful no sees that I have That the vast majority of people who own a bike in New York City Possibly the world.

74
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:10,372
Rym: but I'm just focusing on New York City because that's the data.

75
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:12,319
Rym: I these are the data that I have.

76
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:23,179
Rym: Have no idea how bikes work and Like just they use a bike without understanding what any of the things on the bike do except the pedals.

77
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,484
Rym: kinda Yep, they're in the wrong gear.

78
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:26,908
Rym: Like they've clearly never.

79
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,716
Rym: they've never attempted to squeeze their front brake at any point.

80
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:42,380
Rym: I Love it when I see someone who is biking and the chain is making that sound of you are between gears Your bike is desperately trying to shift and can't and that's just how they bike.

81
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,926
Scott: I don't know how people bike with like.

82
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:47,563
Scott: I see his bike or the drivetrain is just made of rust and it's like it's still Working.

83
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:48,593
Scott: I'm like, how are you riding that?

84
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,319
Scott: How does that even work?

85
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:58,386
Scott: Well, I remember when my bike got stolen and beacon one of the things the dude clearly didn't know how to ride a bike Because I see tons of people way more fit than me and I'm just going right by him Yeah, and they don't see it.

86
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:05,059
Rym: I'm like, alright, but he had cut the Control wire to the front gear because I don't think he knew how it worked.

87
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:10,480
Rym: Mm-hmm, so it would like you basically locked the bike in one gear and there was no way to change gears.

88
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:12,548
Rym: That's one of the modifications.

89
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:15,180
Rym: He made to it when he was riding it around before I stole it back.

90
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,591
Rym: So anyway, I got some news.

91
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,459
Rym: I think we had an update on our.

92
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:23,509
Scott: It's not a big news, but the GeekNights follow-up.

93
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:26,236
Scott: We just did that Pokemon t-shirt story on Tuesday.

94
00:06:26,256 --> 00:06:41,660
Scott: So the person who Submitted that t-shirt was D queued from the contest Yep, and it appears that the $10,000 prize will go to nobody Because the second apparently one of the other finalists was also disqualified for the same reason.

95
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:44,337
Rym: Yeah, and I guess Uniqlo and Pokemon together were like, you know what?

96
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:44,659
Rym: Fuck it.

97
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:50,758
Scott: And then it also appears that no that the t-shirt was supposed to appear in Pokemon sword and shield.

98
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:51,420
Scott: that ain't happen.

99
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,437
Scott: That will not happen.

100
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:56,112
Scott: However, everyone's like, oh, it's probably gonna be in the game.

101
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:58,400
Scott: So you got to do some data mining find it, right?

102
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,319
Scott: Yeah, because they probably programmed it already or whatever.

103
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:04,151
Scott: So, yeah, that's interesting.

104
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:05,419
Scott: see what happens there.

105
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,525
Rym: yep, so, uh, the leave will be when pay.

106
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:15,910
Rym: actually like tried to work it out with them is from what I can tell and Uniqlo Didn't respond and just ended everything.

107
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,108
Rym: They basically just walked away from this whole situation And apparently they don't know which.

108
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:23,040
Scott: I don't know if Uniqlo or Nintendo were the ones paying out the prize.

109
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:42,580
Rym: I believe Uniqlo was because here's what the rules of the thing actually said Uniqlo may withdraw prizes and or and or terminate merchandising of t-shirts with winning artworks without prior notice to the entrant Irrespective of the originality of the artwork submitted the entrant if similar artwork is already publicly available outside Uniqlo stores.

110
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:51,692
Rym: so if I made a completely original design that was Similar to an existing design that I may or may not have known about.

111
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:53,537
Scott: basically they have lawyers.

112
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:54,420
Scott: They covered their ass.

113
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,267
Scott: The ass covering was sufficient.

114
00:07:57,648 --> 00:08:01,440
Rym: In fact, if I submitted something nice butt armor, it's yep.

115
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:06,194
Rym: So basically everyone walked away from this and the whole contest just ended in failure.

116
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:06,756
Rym: Mm-hmm.

117
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:07,980
Rym: That's a shame.

118
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:10,018
Rym: I think the moral is don't enter our contest.

119
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:14,958
Scott: Regardless there will still be some nice Pokemon shirts on sale at Uniqlo.

120
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:15,440
Scott: Don't you worry?

121
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:24,320
Rym: I feel like what we're gonna see is that lower tier anime cons This exact t-shirt will be sold by bootleggers in the artist alley.

122
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:32,827
Rym: I think that's what we're gonna see like 100% and I want you all to post pictures of this when you find it at Your local friendly anime convention.

123
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,573
Scott: You should make a parody of the shirt.

124
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:38,546
Rym: I should it's a parrot Make some sort of joke about Uniqlo.

125
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:42,398
Scott: I don't know what else has a long thing in three dot things.

126
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:44,667
Rym: I don't know I could come over something.

127
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:50,080
Rym: Yeah, so in some other news This is gaming news, but we're gonna focus more on the political angle.

128
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:51,825
Rym: So there is a.

129
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,972
Scott: it's not that it just because it's Thursday not Tuesday.

130
00:08:54,033 --> 00:09:02,500
Rym: Whatever those are there is a bill in Congress of the United States that has and this is shockingly like if you don't live in the u.s.

131
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,948
Rym: Bipartisan bills right don't exist anymore.

132
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:07,473
Scott: Well, it's because they do.

133
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,580
Scott: they're just usually things you never hear about cuz you don't care about.

134
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:16,183
Rym: Well, no, usually they are the bills that are literally necessary to be passed for the government to keep running The bill.

135
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:22,600
Scott: so that's not gonna be reported in the news though unless they lose bipartisan support right which happens actually.

136
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:31,586
Scott: Anyway, the point is that Much like the country of Belgium which banned pretty much all Gambling stuff in games whatsoever.

137
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:44,960
Rym: Yeah Belgian so far China, which also has banned almost similar to Belgium Belgium and gambling in games Even if that gambling is virtual to the point that blizzard said they just won't sell their games there anymore.

138
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,241
Scott: That's right.

139
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:50,540
Scott: China is banning but also went further into limiting other forms of speech like violence and such.

140
00:09:51,142 --> 00:10:02,871
Scott: but the United the bill that's in the Senate right now is only what it says is if your game has random shit like loot boxes, yeah or Pay to win shit, right?

141
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:04,358
Scott: Even if it is not random.

142
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:20,640
Scott: Yep And you're selling this game to minors then you can't do that you have to basically go through great measures to make sure that People under the age of 18 are not playing your game and then you can do some of this gambling biz.

143
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:25,879
Rym: I would argue this is actually a good thing for the industry because you know, it's gonna happen.

144
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:31,680
Rym: Everyone who wants to play these games who is under 18 will play them anyway and buy them with their parents credit card and everything.

145
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,202
Rym: You'll be fine.

146
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:36,256
Rym: Just like how everyone certifies when they make an account on anything.

147
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:37,560
Scott: Everyone sees porn online.

148
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:44,018
Rym: They're all everyone's over the age of 13 whether you're 8 or 80 because you're not allowed to actually provide services to children under COPPA.

149
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:52,181
Rym: so No one almost no one makes a website that technically lets you use it in any way if you're under the age of 13.

150
00:10:52,181 --> 00:11:05,660
Scott: Right, but hopefully what this will do is, you know The the industry most industries video game industry included right are of the opinion Like you we have to self-regulate to a degree such so that the government will not come and regulate.

151
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:07,004
Rym: I'm pretty okay.

152
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:11,800
Scott: And then when the government comes to regulate they say no no, no, let us self-regulate like Facebook.

153
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:14,000
Scott: No, no, no Let us regulate ourselves.

154
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,300
Rym: Well, cuz here's a fine point on this if you're not aware people think you gotta be at Fox watch the n-house.

155
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:20,466
Scott: We will do a good job.

156
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:20,968
Scott: Trust us.

157
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:23,721
Rym: people think you have to be 18 to do things Like.

158
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:30,740
Rym: well, I guess back when blockbuster existed to rent an adult video You needed to be 18 by law to see an R-rated movie.

159
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,632
Rym: You got to be 18 to buy the ticket to buy a violent video game.

160
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:33,833
Rym: get it.

161
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:35,279
Rym: None of those things are laws.

162
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:41,512
Rym: Mm-hmm when I was a kid I went to see R-rated movies like when I was 13 14 by myself.

163
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:46,100
Rym: all the time theater would gladly sell me a ticket Because there was no law about that.

164
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,179
Scott: There were some theaters that voluntarily would try to prevent you.

165
00:11:49,461 --> 00:12:01,060
Rym: But if look basically if local parents made a big deal about it local theaters would enforce these Optional rules these self-regulated rules that the industry would put together just to keep the lawsuits away.

166
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:12,725
Rym: so it's kind of the same thing with a lot of video game stuff and This law would actually force compliance or at least force Ostensible compliance.

167
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:25,320
Scott: the most interesting part of the law is simply that they attempted to in legal terms Define what counts as pay to win in a court of law Which I'm kind of excited about because fuck pay to win.

168
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:25,862
Scott: That's right.

169
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:31,759
Rym: Like I want to use a blunt hammer to end anyone's ability to sell video game I really need a win.

170
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:36,860
Scott: There's also a couple related stories and a. I would like to whisper into some.

171
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,569
Scott: Lavi a be a lobbyist so I could whisper in some ears.

172
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:45,512
Scott: obvious would be a good job and be like, hey, you know Pokemon cards and magic cards are basically the same thing.

173
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:46,858
Scott: Why don't we apply this to those two?

174
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,340
Scott: And be The ESA which if you don't know is basically like the RA for video games.

175
00:12:55,522 --> 00:13:01,800
Scott: It is like a bunch of you know Lawyers and lobbyists for the video game industry that are supposed to make sure the government doesn't do things like this.

176
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:05,940
Rym: Arguably, they failed because their job was to make sure laws like this don't appear.

177
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,264
Scott: Well many people.

178
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:14,359
Scott: the ESA does two things it lobbies the government, right and it helps fight You know for the video game industry's interest in court.

179
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:17,088
Scott: And it runs e3 and the.

180
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:23,769
Scott: basically the members of the ESA are not happy with pretty much anything The ESA does is doing a real bad job.

181
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:24,793
Rym: E3 is a shit show.

182
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:26,700
Scott: It's doing a real bad job across the board.

183
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:33,246
Scott: They want e3 to be split off into its own thing and the ESA is doing real bad a job at lobbying Which is why these kind of laws are coming out.

184
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:38,000
Scott: So the downfall of the ESA has been in the news recently as well.

185
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:47,639
Scott: So it's interesting coincidence that here comes a whole something an example of the ESA doing a bad job At least at its goals whether if you agree with those goals or not.

186
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:53,089
Rym: Right after there were stories about the ESA suck What I am very happy about is the law seems to have.

187
00:13:53,109 --> 00:14:00,209
Scott: I feel like if today there was a story about Rym being real bad at Jumping or walking and then next week.

188
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:01,996
Scott: There was a story about Rym tripping over his own feet.

189
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:05,408
Rym: Yep, basically But this law fell down and hurt himself.

190
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:10,959
Scott: I like how the bill and I just read an article last week about Walking and that was the article about Rym falling over.

191
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:20,052
Rym: But the bill is very focused on the things we're actually mad about and it is not in any way about Violence about content.

192
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:21,340
Rym: it is literally clearly.

193
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,480
Scott: It's one of those ones where there's no senator in the Senate who knows a fuck all about any of this.

194
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:27,059
Scott: Yeah, right.

195
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,268
Scott: so it's clearly written by some congressional staff.

196
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:35,293
Scott: like most things are you know who are intelligent and know what's up and The reason the senators support it?

197
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:41,900
Scott: because yeah This is to crack down on get kids gambling like oh pretty much any old white person can get behind that.

198
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,766
Scott: Yep, so there you go.

199
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:48,260
Rym: also quote from the article under the protecting children from abusive games act.

200
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,938
Rym: there you go, and they define abuse as basically addictive shit and Manipulating them to get money out of them.

201
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,103
Rym: Yep Like that's kind of.

202
00:14:56,404 --> 00:15:05,137
Rym: it says games that are marketed to children would be prohibited from implementing any pay-to-win Mechanisms all games would be forbidden from selling loot boxes to children, etc.

203
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:05,278
Rym: Etc.

204
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:08,126
Rym: So we'll see where this all goes.

205
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:12,120
Rym: but it has bipartisan support which is rare with this kind of law.

206
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:16,454
Rym: Usually when there's bipartisan support for a law that's restrictive on media.

207
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:18,000
Rym: Those laws tend to be shitty laws.

208
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:21,219
Rym: So the only problem is that right now?

209
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,220
Rym: Basically, no legislation can move anywhere in our government because of the president refusing to sign anything.

210
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,466
Scott: I'm sure he will sign it.

211
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:30,919
Scott: the protect children from gambling abuse.

212
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,608
Scott: Even even this president will sign that.

213
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:41,300
Rym: I don't think so because he basically just said that he won't sign anything Until the house stops investigating.

214
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:45,913
Scott: Personally, why do you believe anything the lyingest liar in the history of lying ever said?

215
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:53,474
Rym: because the one thing the lyingest liar doesn't lie about is Threatening people unless they stop investigating him for shit.

216
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:54,820
Scott: That's actually not true.

217
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,139
Scott: He threatens people all the time and then doesn't go through with it or or tries to sue people and fails all the time.

218
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:03,531
Rym: But in this case, it's something he actually has control over.

219
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,160
Rym: Usually the threats he makes are things he can't actually do.

220
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:08,760
Scott: Yeah, I mean he just cuz he can do it doesn't mean gonna do it.

221
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:15,807
Scott: Listen, if the if somehow this actually gets to his decks, I think he would be like hey look at me I'm protecting kids from whatever.

222
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:16,690
Scott: what okay?

223
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,272
Rym: I don't know.

224
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:17,795
Rym: I bet he wouldn't.

225
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:19,180
Rym: I bet this bill goes nowhere.

226
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:20,547
Scott: I mean, that's probably true.

227
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:21,029
Scott: Also.

228
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,260
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of I don't think it'll even get to this.

229
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:34,520
Rym: So, uh in some other last news This is just a tweet but I have a lot to say about it It's in the tree was someone saying oh, we're not dumbing down our culture at all.

230
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,640
Rym: Basically someone got a picture of at Target.

231
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:42,740
Rym: Target they're selling classic movies on DVD or blu-ray or whatever.

232
00:16:43,526 --> 00:17:03,413
Rym: but Instead of putting the title of the movie on the top of the cover like every DVD has been for all of history They're putting the quote from the movie That basic people who don't know anything about cinema and have not seen these movies Would recognize even if they don't know what the movie is called.

233
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:05,339
Scott: I don't understand what you're saying.

234
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:08,631
Rym: So the move the box for Scarface.

235
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:18,800
Rym: the top says say hello to my little friend Like that's the name of the movie and at the bottom in a much smaller font Scarface I mean someone who's still buying DVDs and blu-rays.

236
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:25,386
Scott: That's the kind of person that that is probably a better sales dress that Jaws is titled.

237
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,980
Rym: you're gonna need a bigger boat and then Jaws isn't a little text at the bottom.

238
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,940
Rym: So it's interesting because I think it's a very smart marketing decision.

239
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,711
Scott: It's good trade dress first, you know target audience.

240
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:39,880
Scott: So it is buying movies at Best Buy right?

241
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,303
Scott: It's like, you know, they're not gonna buy Jaws, you know Can you like?

242
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:46,472
Scott: how can you even sell a Jaws on DVD?

243
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:48,440
Scott: that movie is just like so easily available?

244
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,136
Scott: Yeah, right, but I guess that's probably the only way to convince someone to buy.

245
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:54,119
Scott: it is like, you know they see that and they're like.

246
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:59,714
Rym: So I guess what I'm getting at is that people are really on TV all the time.

247
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:06,708
Scott: Someone who's buying discs at Best Buy definitely has cable TV is probably watching it But it sort of gets back to like.

248
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:08,355
Rym: how do people find and search for things?

249
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:11,868
Rym: a lot of people Don't know a lot about things.

250
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,560
Rym: using the someone's more likely to recognize.

251
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:18,840
Rym: Say hello to my little friend then have any idea who Al Pacino is right?

252
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:28,968
Scott: The other thing is that you know, it's somebody who John when was Jaws in theaters 1970 something Early 80s late 70s something like that, right?

253
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:33,540
Scott: It's old so people don't know it, but that's what I'm saying.

254
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:35,009
Rym: I'm not mad about this.

255
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:36,599
Rym: I think it's a good idea.

256
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:41,300
Scott: Yeah, but the best part is fuck is on the the label of a disc.

257
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:44,734
Scott: I'm more mad that why are people still buying discs?

258
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:46,240
Scott: eliminate all physical media?

259
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:49,711
Rym: But the best part about this is all the replies to the tweets.

260
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:53,367
Rym: not polluting the earth with your plastic because the replies to the Tweet are things like oh man.

261
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:55,379
Rym: I can't wait to watch you son of a bitch.

262
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:58,409
Rym: Or I'm gonna have me some fun.

263
00:18:58,831 --> 00:18:59,675
Scott: Go have me some fun.

264
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:00,660
Rym: Go have me some fun.

265
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:03,405
Rym: Hey, have you ever seen?

266
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:05,270
Rym: I'll be back and it's sequel.

267
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:06,975
Rym: come with me if you want to live.

268
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:08,860
Scott: no, but I have you see.

269
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,100
Scott: I Know I Feel like calling that movie.

270
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:22,660
Rym: I'm here to chew bobo gum and kick ass comma And I'm all out of gum is Literally the only way to get anyone who hasn't already seen that movie.

271
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,169
Scott: I see we're done with the show you gonna want.

272
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:36,533
Rym: you want to go watch put the sunglasses on But anyway things of the day what do you got?

273
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:38,240
Scott: so there's this dude, what's it?

274
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,265
Scott: What's his channel called?

275
00:19:39,285 --> 00:19:41,438
Rym: his channel is called goat rides bikes.

276
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:41,740
Rym: Okay?

277
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,463
Rym: He's only got 428 subscribers anyway, he's got 429.

278
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:48,150
Scott: it's his bike riding guy.

279
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,680
Scott: You know he's not the most interesting dude honest.

280
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:52,084
Scott: Sorry goat.

281
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:58,809
Scott: He's not a bad dude though, and what's interesting is he it's a video of his bike commute And he's narrating his bike commute.

282
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,583
Scott: It's kind of a long one yeah So you know.

283
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:14,656
Scott: anyway the thing is his bike commute is from his suburban ish home to his workplace Which is in a warehouse in a place that I'd never heard of Known as the Springfield underground.

284
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:24,168
Rym: now I assume when Scott said that that it's like the Rochester subway like some abandoned subway that someone got access to I'd never heard Of the Springfield underground before.

285
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:31,693
Scott: obviously neither is Rym neither of most people But once you learn what the Springfield underground is it is fascinating and amazing.

286
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:34,360
Scott: what around apparently way back in the day?

287
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,849
Scott: There was a mine, and they were mining.

288
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,940
Scott: I think he said limestone for fertilizer.

289
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,732
Rym: So fun facts inside.

290
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:43,760
Rym: you know what's under Detroit?

291
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,080
Rym: What did I think the biggest salt mine in the world like the salt catacombs anyway?

292
00:20:48,780 --> 00:21:04,145
Scott: So that mine is obviously no one's mining there anymore, but it was this vast Empty underground space where a lot of rock had been removed But it was pretty much flat with a ceiling you know and some pillars of rock because you can't remove them all then they will Collapse in on.

293
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:10,155
Scott: yeah, right yeah, so some rock pillars You know sort of like you know the big empty warehouse.

294
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:10,938
Rym: so it's got.

295
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:16,214
Rym: here's a question Do you know what it's called when a stalag tight and a stalagmite meet a stag?

296
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:18,120
Rym: there is a word for a stalag.

297
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:19,225
Rym: I looked everything.

298
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,511
Rym: I actually forgot it.

299
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,818
Rym: I don't remember the word a stalag

300
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:38,589
Scott: not Stalagma tight Magnetite I don't know anyway, so in the Springfield underground what they did is they said hey We got this big empty space here right in this big empty space it is a Always like 62 degrees no matter fucking what.

301
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,636
Scott: no right it doesn't.

302
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:41,640
Rym: that's how heat pumps work.

303
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:45,334
Scott: I mean it doesn't get hot or cold ever it's always the same temperature.

304
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:46,940
Scott: There's a lot of room.

305
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:50,091
Scott: It's big and wide and open right.

306
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:51,980
Scott: there must be some kind of ventilation going on.

307
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,026
Scott: I don't know if he talked about that.

308
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:55,480
Rym: I mean mines usually had some sort of ventilation strategy.

309
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,140
Scott: No one's right.

310
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,483
Scott: I saw there was a part where he looks and there's a big hole in the ceiling with like water coming in from and from Sunlight coming in.

311
00:22:01,844 --> 00:22:02,506
Scott: so you know.

312
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:03,870
Scott: and what they did is it?

313
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:12,349
Scott: well all we got to do is between some of these rock pillars we put up a few walls right and then the natural walls are behind there.

314
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:16,974
Scott: and Boom you just got yourself a warehouse for like no effort.

315
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:19,464
Scott: You don't got to build ceiling You don't got to build a wall.

316
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:20,548
Scott: You know you build one wall.

317
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:22,596
Scott: Yeah boom enormous warehouse.

318
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:24,965
Scott: It is a Ultra secure.

319
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:26,170
Scott: no all right.

320
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:28,780
Scott: It must be real hard to get in there and rob those warehouses.

321
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,850
Scott: Right be ultra temperature and humidity control.

322
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:36,620
Scott: you don't got to have H vac or heating or anything right?

323
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:45,400
Scott: It's just good to go and You got tons of fucking room real cheap because who else wants to be underground and it's enormous.

324
00:22:46,263 --> 00:22:53,950
Scott: So he bikes to work in a warehouse and he bikes through this enormous Springfield underground And he shows you what's going on down there.

325
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,020
Scott: They're building some more warehouses down there.

326
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,365
Scott: They got all kinds of stuff.

327
00:22:57,405 --> 00:22:59,553
Rym: that stalagnates is where they meet.

328
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,300
Scott: okay you Adam anyway.

329
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:03,526
Scott: But yeah, it's really interesting.

330
00:23:03,646 --> 00:23:09,940
Scott: I think the only thing that was a it's like a waste of energy down There was that there's there's doing food storage.

331
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,886
Scott: So they do have to have some refrigeration going on.

332
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:22,257
Scott: well the refrigeration only has to get from 62 down as opposed to exactly Yeah, even in the hot hot 90 degree summer if you had your warehouse outside What would the bill be for that?

333
00:23:22,962 --> 00:23:26,480
Scott: They also have to light the whole thing you know, and I'm sure there must have added lights pretty.

334
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:28,289
Scott: I'm curious about the plumbing situation.

335
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,520
Rym: I mean there's probably a bathroom in there somewhere.

336
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:32,699
Scott: I mean you wouldn't make it to the bathroom.

337
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,522
Scott: It's too big.

338
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:36,632
Scott: just if you had to go outside to poop you wouldn't make.

339
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:40,514
Scott: I guess you could just put bring porta potties in and out at worst case you could.

340
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:45,995
Scott: just You do need running water to wash your hands Yeah, but there's plenty of room for the parking lots.

341
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:47,442
Scott: pulling her into bike You know.

342
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:50,636
Scott: so pretty fascinating to see what's going on in the place.

343
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,962
Scott: I didn't know existed Underground.

344
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:57,516
Rym: so I got a question for you when the first spy satellites were put up in space?

345
00:23:57,957 --> 00:24:02,848
Scott: when was this like 60s 60s 70s yeah Even 80s?

346
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:09,018
Rym: okay well yeah Earlier spy satellites, how do you think they got images back to earth?

347
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:09,600
Scott: well?

348
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:11,820
Scott: They didn't have the internet right yeah.

349
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,080
Scott: So they definitely had a satellite dish on the ground aimed at the satellite with some sort of data going between.

350
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:20,151
Scott: No much like satellite technology didn't really exist.

351
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:22,680
Rym: yet for images there were satellite television.

352
00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:25,239
Scott: Uh what what in the 80s?

353
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:31,639
Rym: What would they use in a satellite to capture the image to then transmit back a?

354
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:38,319
Rym: Camera with a big-ass fucking lens on what did know that was not feasible technology back then?

355
00:24:39,522 --> 00:24:40,044
Scott: What do you mean?

356
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,877
Rym: Why not, but do you know how?

357
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:43,440
Rym: early?

358
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:45,754
Rym: Cameras worked for like TV.

359
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:49,091
Scott: right, but you read Like a TV camera on a salad.

360
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:50,580
Rym: There's no way to put that on a satellite.

361
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,192
Scott: They couldn't put a TV camera from the other side of a satellite.

362
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:54,980
Rym: No you also couldn't transmit that back.

363
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,519
Rym: Satellites in that era fucking shot canisters of film back down to earth.

364
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:03,508
Scott: Physical film they just there's film.

365
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:04,751
Scott: they took photos and they drop.

366
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:09,604
Rym: TV cameras weren't even high enough resolution to get meaningful images Film and just stopped.

367
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:15,480
Rym: yeah, that is literally how they worked and this video explains in detail you had to catch the film.

368
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,547
Scott: Yes, what the Russians caught the film.

369
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:21,000
Scott: so if they shot the film did they go around trying to catch Russian film?

370
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,170
Rym: Yeah, if we didn't get the film down the film was designed.

371
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,960
Rym: if we didn't pick it up within 48 hours it destroyed itself.

372
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:28,572
Scott: What did we try to catch?

373
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:29,096
Scott: Russian film?

374
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:29,137
Scott: I?

375
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,632
Rym: This video will tell you everything catching a Russian film.

376
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:34,460
Rym: I don't think we ever caught any of their film.

377
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,408
Scott: What kind of film was it actually?

378
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:38,577
Rym: this tells you everything about even how the lenses worked.

379
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:46,386
Rym: the lenses Actually had to be really complicated for a bunch of reasons I don't want to get into of course because yeah This video is actually.

380
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:50,099
Scott: they could zoom in way more than you think they could zoom in real far.

381
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,468
Rym: Yep, how they calibrated the images.

382
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:56,000
Rym: this video in ten minutes will tell you some fascinating shit.

383
00:25:57,342 --> 00:26:00,078
Scott: Yeah, they couldn't just throw there a bunch of empty satellites up there.

384
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:03,836
Rym: They've had satellites for d orbited as far as I can tell.

385
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:05,145
Scott: otherwise I say hey Let's go up and get one.

386
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:06,012
Rym: This is a good bit.

387
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,040
Scott: You got a real good lens on it.

388
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,933
Scott: We can take photos man.

389
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:10,692
Scott: Yeah That lens is still good even that the film is done.

390
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:20,435
Rym: the lens had a Sweeping mechanism to make the lens take a picture of one part of the ground because the satellites going by at a crazy speed It'll be blurry otherwise yep.

391
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:27,100
Rym: So yeah in the moment the GeekNights book club book as we talked about in the beginning is a book by Troy deading.

392
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:37,820
Rym: That is a Dungeons & Dragons Branded Planescape book from the early days of the Planescape setting officially licensed D&D novel that the first half of it is a straight.

393
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,283
Rym: Well the first third of it is a straightforward D&D book just like all that elf crap I used to read.

394
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:45,860
Rym: and the rest of it is a trippy nightmare descent into hell.

395
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:48,586
Rym: It's a pretty good way to describe it.

396
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:52,480
Rym: surreal nonsense happens at the end, and we're reading it.

397
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,608
Rym: We'll probably done with it by the next Thursday's show.

398
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:55,551
Scott: We'll see.

399
00:26:55,832 --> 00:26:57,599
Rym: I doubt it's gonna be sunny every day.

400
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:58,584
Scott: We'll see.

401
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:01,095
Rym: hey you got a flight to Rochester you finish it on that flight.

402
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:01,980
Scott: That's not a bad idea.

403
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,970
Rym: Yeah, we might both finish it on that flight.

404
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:04,734
Rym: If nothing else.

405
00:27:04,815 --> 00:27:07,648
Scott: That's on the 4th of July though Yeah, so worst case in August.

406
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,239
Rym: We will do this show okay probably before then.

407
00:27:11,441 --> 00:27:21,220
Scott: the next invention we're going to is PAX West which is a long time from now, but I Mention it because a badges will be on sale soon after Memorial Day, but not before Memorial Day.

408
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,714
Scott: So this weekend you can just relax and then after that you got to be at a highest alert.

409
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:36,214
Rym: Yeah starting Tuesday Morning Eastern Daylight Time it is red alert and by Thursday It is like black alert like Def Con one.

410
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:37,700
Rym: the nukes were launched also.

411
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,593
Scott: They are doing something that they are undoing a previous policy.

412
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:42,857
Rym: the panel submissions are open to.

413
00:27:42,897 --> 00:27:43,660
Rym: I gotta get in that shit.

414
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,200
Scott: They are going to once again be selling full weekend passes.

415
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:51,100
Scott: So I'm sure they won't be any cheaper than four individual one-day passes.

416
00:27:51,522 --> 00:27:52,285
Scott: But they will see.

417
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:55,840
Scott: you only have to carry one piece of plastic around with you for all four days.

418
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:59,489
Scott: My I think you know we we were talking about.

419
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:02,700
Scott: hey selling the individual passes changes the culture of packs.

420
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,019
Scott: But I think what this won't do any have that effect.

421
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:07,049
Rym: I think it's because same effect they're basically.

422
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:24,640
Scott: they think they're looking at their numbers and saying well This many people bought one of each day, so we'll just sell that many weekend passes Maybe a little less than that yeah, and then we'll just basically make the same amount of money sell the same badges But a certain number of people won't have to carry around all this extra plastic with them.

423
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:27,260
Rym: Yeah, I mean I don't know exactly what if I were doing it.

424
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:35,158
Rym: I would just say if someone by if someone can legitimately get all four days in their order They will just get a single four-day badge instead.

425
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:36,748
Scott: well What if they want it?

426
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:49,343
Scott: you know I guess they could be a checkbox saying yes Please send me four separate ones because maybe you buy one of each day And it's like two or for your friend on Friday Saturday, and yeah two or for you on whatever Sunday Monday I don't know,

427
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:50,890
Rym: but at the other counter point

428
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,577
Scott: was that somebody would buy all the days But not actually want a single person to go.

429
00:28:55,657 --> 00:28:58,389
Rym: all true But the counterpoint would be many of the people.

430
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,678
Rym: is some of the people doing the vast majority scalp?

431
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,040
Scott: yes But the vast majority who are buying all four days want to go all have a person who's going off?

432
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,820
Rym: Yes, and before anyone tries to talk again about like scalpers ruining this scalpers are not the problem.

433
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:15,653
Rym: Pax is just not cannot be physically big enough to give everyone wants it a badge.

434
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:20,419
Scott: scalpers are a symptom of any time that demand exceeds supply.

435
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:23,616
Scott: Someone will come in and arbitrage to make money.

436
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,987
Scott: yep And the scalpers aren't the cause of the problem.

437
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:36,980
Rym: the problem is there's not enough and Pax has decided very pointedly for good or ill That they'd rather it be random who gets in based partly on who's paying the most attention.

438
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:43,680
Scott: Then let it just be Pax badges $500 or you know have tiers of pricing or anything like that.

439
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,825
Rym: Yeah, I'm glad they have not done.

440
00:29:44,845 --> 00:29:55,368
Scott: because yes scalpers are a problem for things where demand It doesn't actually meet supply or comes close to meeting supply or this would sell out But it'll take a month for it to sell out naturally.

441
00:29:55,749 --> 00:30:03,500
Scott: so scalpers come in and eat up the extra supply And then jack up the price usually with the cooperation of companies like Ticketmaster.

442
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,460
Scott: Yeah, but once those cases you can blame scalpers.

443
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:11,898
Rym: But once the demand is known and the demand is already above the capacity scalpers have no impact.

444
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:16,660
Rym: yes Also, I noticed scalpers have a hard time actually selling their badges these days.

445
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:19,620
Scott: They stand outside of packs like go buy and selling guys.

446
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:22,488
Rym: I think as most people I just sell badges.

447
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:36,973
Rym: I think it's because anyone who doesn't live in Seattle and Doesn't get badges when they first go on sale does not have a hotel because the hotel sell out, too They're not gonna fly to Seattle and risk not getting badges.

448
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:38,037
Scott: I'm gonna scalp a hotel.

449
00:30:38,218 --> 00:30:44,959
Scott: Yeah There's no scalping But you could basically you can scalp by selling your badges to someone who lives there and does not have a thing.

450
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:53,414
Rym: yep But Seattle is a tiny little baby city that doesn't have that many people in it yet And especially not on the weekend when you know there's no one as at work.

451
00:30:53,654 --> 00:30:56,527
Rym: Yep, so uh Anyway, let's get to the main bit.

452
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:03,525
Rym: There was a movie that came out in and We're sort of gonna review it.

453
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:06,939
Rym: I guess we're gonna spoil shit cuz I assume you've seen this movie.

454
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:20,676
Rym: It's gonna talk about the matrix because the thing that stands out in my mind to this day Is that this is probably the first movie I ever saw and I have tried and succeeded to have this experience for a lot of movies in my adult life, and I love it.

455
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:26,573
Rym: when this happens like When I went to see us I didn't know anything about it except.

456
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:29,140
Rym: I saw did not even the teaser trailer.

457
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,749
Rym: I just saw the image the movie poster.

458
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:37,146
Rym: when I went to see the matrix all I knew about it was It's about some hacker guy.

459
00:31:37,287 --> 00:31:42,598
Scott: well the the marketing campaign for the matrix which I remember because I was alive And was the target audience yep?

460
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,844
Scott: Well, yeah, I was.

461
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:47,334
Rym: we were wondering like you want to look at the demographic.

462
00:31:47,354 --> 00:31:48,660
Rym: They were trying to get to see the matrix.

463
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:49,555
Rym: It's me and Scott.

464
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:55,558
Scott: anyway It was a very very good marketing campaign where you know back in the day where I still saw ads.

465
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:56,320
Scott: yep, right?

466
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,462
Rym: What is the matrix?

467
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:02,679
Scott: put all these signs around and all the posters and images were this black sheet with green?

468
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,947
Scott: Hacker hacker text falling down.

469
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,955
Scott: even had that as desktop wallpaper at some point.

470
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:07,196
Scott: Yep.

471
00:32:07,296 --> 00:32:09,924
Scott: I had that as a Screensaver.

472
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:12,138
Scott: screensaver - yeah, yeah, I had that screensaver.

473
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:17,920
Scott: anyway It was black screen with green stuff trickling down green characters trickling down a very hacker aesthetic.

474
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,687
Scott: And they were all like what is the matrix?

475
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:25,560
Scott: question mark Gabbo Gabbo Gabbo, and they didn't tell you fucking shit.

476
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:25,941
Scott: There was.

477
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:27,948
Scott: no there might have been a trailer.

478
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:28,710
Scott: I never saw it.

479
00:32:29,553 --> 00:32:31,640
Rym: I was on the hype train from day one.

480
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:38,480
Scott: I was a website I went to in the end on my Netscape navigator browser that didn't have much information at all whatsoever.

481
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:41,068
Rym: So I was like I'm gonna see this movie.

482
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:42,012
Rym: I went opening night.

483
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:43,840
Scott: I was like yeah, what is the fucking matrix?

484
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:44,819
Scott: Let's go find out.

485
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,491
Scott: It's definitely appealing to my aesthetic.

486
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:52,401
Rym: me and Ken and like my whole high school crew we just went to see the matrix and The.

487
00:32:52,442 --> 00:32:54,407
Rym: we watched the movie and we were like alright.

488
00:32:54,448 --> 00:32:54,829
Rym: This is cool.

489
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:55,230
Rym: This is cool.

490
00:32:55,270 --> 00:33:01,615
Rym: This is cool, and then when he wakes up Outside of the matrix I know I went to the theater.

491
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:02,500
Rym: when what?

492
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:11,299
Rym: I figured out before then oh yeah, but but there was a physical palpable loud reaction in the theater.

493
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:21,860
Rym: Remember, I remember that moment when he when he like pulls the thing out of his throat and like looks around The theater was like wow there was like a lot of rumbling in the audience.

494
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:28,080
Rym: Right and I saw the matrix like four more times in the theater.

495
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:41,033
Scott: Yep, and I still remember I dis interesting neither one of us actually remembered the order of all the scenes Especially in the early part, but I remembered every scene.

496
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:44,685
Rym: I remember every scene Mostly right.

497
00:33:44,886 --> 00:33:50,649
Rym: I remember this movie in like a weird degree of detail Mmm, and I still love it.

498
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,340
Rym: Yeah, this movie makes the very short list of movies.

499
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,620
Rym: Can I have a list we always try to maintain of what is a movie where if you're?

500
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,879
Rym: Reminded that it exists you immediately feel an urge to just watch it.

501
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:04,580
Scott: If it is on you'll just watch it.

502
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:12,697
Scott: You're just gonna be trained Snared by it like a bear trap where you have to sit there until it's over like when I was Rewind it and watch it again when I was home yesterday.

503
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,165
Rym: I go out to right now.

504
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:21,065
Rym: when I was at home over the summer like after a freshman year of RIT The matrix was just on TV Half the time.

505
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:25,280
Rym: I just like stop changing the channels and just watch it at least until the next commercial break.

506
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:25,862
Rym: Yeah, it's like.

507
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:26,404
Rym: Oh matrix.

508
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:26,864
Rym: Yeah.

509
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:27,828
Rym: Yeah matrix.

510
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:35,530
Rym: Oh, yeah They're like maybe 12 movies that exist on earth that are on that list for me And somehow the matrix is one of them.

511
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,266
Scott: so words about the movie itself I just want to talk about.

512
00:34:38,288 --> 00:34:39,719
Scott: like the more meta stuff.

513
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,599
Scott: Yeah, so the other meta thing besides the marketing campaign is that this is a movie that?

514
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:53,139
Scott: Introduced a lot of existing cinematographic techniques and styles to the u.s.

515
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:59,135
Scott: Western audience right specifically Hong Kong action cinema who shot kung fu stuff right.

516
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:02,685
Scott: so I've seen many kung fu movies Right, but I hadn't seen that.

517
00:35:02,705 --> 00:35:03,086
Scott: you know.

518
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:05,613
Scott: this is different styles of kung fu movie right.

519
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:14,284
Scott: there's the style where people are doing like realistic Kung fu right and then there's a style where people are like jumping 20 feet in the air like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

520
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:29,219
Scott: and the matrix was like the first Western movie to at least to the mass You know Hollywood Audience make that kind of action scene like the core of its aesthetic right where it's like.

521
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:38,055
Scott: yeah They're not just fighting like you know they do in Terminator 2 or Rambo And a Van Damme like kickboxer movie right?

522
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:39,340
Scott: or karate kid.

523
00:35:39,842 --> 00:35:42,090
Scott: You know it was like her bloodsport.

524
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,217
Scott: It was like sure but exactly right.

525
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:44,960
Scott: it wasn't like that.

526
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,837
Scott: It was superhero fighting superhero kung fu and before the matrix there wasn't a movie that did that.

527
00:35:50,878 --> 00:35:54,179
Scott: and after the matrix There are many Western movies that have done this yep.

528
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:56,265
Rym: And it also introduced like.

529
00:35:56,807 --> 00:36:07,180
Rym: it is hard to understate how many people who had never encountered like babies first solipsism babies first philosophy shadows in a cave.

530
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:12,379
Rym: Every fucking edgelord kid thought they were a philosopher after they saw this movie.

531
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:12,540
Scott: right.

532
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:20,363
Scott: well Basically what the matrix does is it combines all these basic things into a never-before-made Combination right.

533
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:35,779
Scott: so you're combining a the what if we're all living in a simulation thing which has another side Which is an idea that I had come across prior to seeing the matrix yep So in the same year another movie called the 13th floor came out.

534
00:36:36,643 --> 00:36:37,951
Scott: That was about a bunch of.

535
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:39,440
Scott: I have not seen that but I heard of it.

536
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:41,330
Rym: Oh, I'm not even gonna say anything else.

537
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:42,597
Scott: It's better than the matrix.

538
00:36:42,798 --> 00:36:48,174
Rym: Yes The 13th floor it's not a watch it a million times movie, so it's not better than the main.

539
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:51,884
Rym: well because the matrix is Better at being a movie.

540
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:56,560
Rym: I just never want to not watch because of all the Hong Kong cinema kung fu action.

541
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:02,600
Rym: But the 13th floor is a smarter movie that makes a much more complex and nuanced point.

542
00:37:03,383 --> 00:37:06,980
Rym: Like the 13th floor is a really really really good movie, and you should see it.

543
00:37:07,462 --> 00:37:08,166
Rym: I would watch it again.

544
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:14,176
Rym: the matrix also had like the blue pill red pill action Yeah, which has been co-opted by the worst people on earth.

545
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:22,057
Rym: Yeah But when it can I remember like before like incel shitlords made red pill a thing right.

546
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:26,488
Rym: blue pill red pill was a Thing for edgelords around being edgy and cool.

547
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:28,373
Scott: and also what the matrix.

548
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:37,452
Scott: while it has a white Hero problem yeah white dude hero problem and also has a white Savior problem I think it's the right term.

549
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:37,919
Scott: right yeah.

550
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:43,674
Scott: And also has the yes the white hero Savior has to definitely kiss.

551
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:46,882
Scott: the lady right has those two Problems.

552
00:37:46,922 --> 00:37:48,888
Rym: yeah, why did I have to be a love interest?

553
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:52,679
Scott: it also has plenty of kick-ass ladies and colored people in it.

554
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:56,014
Scott: yep Sort of has the negatives and the positives.

555
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:58,219
Scott: It's on that border between right.

556
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:07,900
Scott: Anyway, yeah The other thing is that the matrix combines the not also not something you know it's an aesthetic that I was familiar with.

557
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,219
Scott: But the pot the mass uh you know Western audience was not the cyberpunk snow crash aesthetic.

558
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:15,689
Rym: yep I was part of why I love it so much.

559
00:38:15,749 --> 00:38:27,601
Rym: is that I love that aesthetic and the only place I really got to see that aesthetic pre matrix was Blade Runner Shadowrun Shadowrun and a bunch of a Spider-Man 2099.

560
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:35,909
Rym: That's part of why I was so into anime because there was a lot of stuff like that in the kind of anime I was watching right before I got to our IT.

561
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:45,679
Scott: funny that they actually made matrix anime officially after the mate right yep Which if you haven't seen the only other canon matrix material yeah, and it's pretty good like you should see it.

562
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:50,474
Scott: Yeah, the anime the anime tricks and the matrix of the only canon matrix material.

563
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:51,397
Rym: It's really a shame.

564
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:56,040
Scott: the Wachowski sisters Someone tried to make an MMO once but that didn't turn out too.

565
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,793
Rym: Well, I heard that someone tried to make a sequel to the matrix.

566
00:38:58,894 --> 00:38:59,738
Scott: that didn't come out though.

567
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:05,192
Rym: I know shame the point is I've never seen the matrix reloaded.

568
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:07,000
Scott: okay never on Netflix.

569
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:12,860
Rym: Oh Scott was convinced for like a decade that I'd seen it and even argued with me that I may actually watch him.

570
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:17,420
Scott: I may watch those non-canon materials just to remember them after because they're on Netflix.

571
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:23,660
Rym: But Scott you seriously tried to argue with me that I saw the matrix reloaded with you in the theater.

572
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:28,249
Scott: Not only did I know it's been well established my memory is not great except apparently passwords.

573
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:34,790
Rym: Yeah But I did go to see matrix revolutions in the theater, and I did not need to have seen matrix really don't?

574
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:47,621
Scott: The point is matrix also combined that cyberpunk aesthetic right with right with the wuxia kung fu aesthetic Yeah, and the HR Geiger aesthetic yeah Never.

575
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:48,825
Scott: it is like this.

576
00:39:49,025 --> 00:39:53,518
Scott: you know know what other thing combines all the good ins into one bucket?

577
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:54,260
Rym: like to get that.

578
00:39:54,381 --> 00:40:01,397
Rym: I'd have to just watch Blade Runner and Pretend that they're in the same universe like your turn to the 36 chamber.

579
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:14,179
Rym: We actually have the flying people But it's really honestly Blade Runner and alien would really make sense to be in the same universe sure like Considering the plot of both of them and the themes they both address and I'd have to watch both of those.

580
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:15,965
Rym: Then watch I don't know.

581
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:20,882
Scott: I think it more makes more sense for alien to just come way after 2001 in 2010.

582
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:23,900
Rym: Yeah, I think that could work anyway anyway.

583
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,118
Rym: So I love the shit out of the matrix, and I feel like I'm gonna watch it again like you just did.

584
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:30,117
Scott: yeah Why not yeah?

585
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,022
Rym: It was just great.

586
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:31,524
Scott: I watched it.

587
00:40:31,544 --> 00:40:32,246
Scott: It was so fucking great.

588
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:34,836
Scott: Yeah, so what's great about the matrix?

589
00:40:34,856 --> 00:40:42,523
Scott: so first of all right The all those action scenes I just talked about with all the kung fu and all that biz right there super well choreographed Right.

590
00:40:42,703 --> 00:40:44,270
Rym: they're not a bunch of fast cuts.

591
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,720
Rym: They're long cuts like I like in kung fu movies.

592
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,027
Rym: They're not that long But they're longer than the average American action movie.

593
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,772
Rym: up to that point a at for the.

594
00:40:52,153 --> 00:41:07,578
Scott: whether they invented or popularized it They were the first to deploy the technique of having a ton of cameras in an arc around the scene bullet time and then Panning from one camera to the next and they use this right in the opening scene.

595
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:10,268
Scott: right Trinity jumps up in the air right.

596
00:41:10,288 --> 00:41:13,300
Scott: you're looking at her straight on and then the camera.

597
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:14,503
Scott: It looks like the cat.

598
00:41:14,644 --> 00:41:28,620
Scott: everything is frozen and the camera is moving while time is stopped to then come to the side Profile, but in the way They did this was just a bunch of cameras right all lined up and then use some computers to get the in-between bits right.

599
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,840
Scott: So before that that was not a technique that was used often.

600
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:35,577
Scott: Maybe maybe even invented it or were the first to use it.

601
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:36,726
Scott: in Hollywood There is a whole.

602
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:38,420
Scott: now it is used all the fucking time.

603
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:42,979
Rym: There's a whole Wikipedia article just on bullet time as a concept.

604
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:48,777
Rym: yep Cuz bullet time is a registered trademark of Warner Brothers who made this movie.

605
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,500
Scott: I'm pretty sure right.

606
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:53,949
Scott: Another thing it goes on in the matrix.

607
00:41:54,210 --> 00:42:00,880
Rym: Oh get this they trademarked it in 2005 Mm-hmm as used in the matrix online.

608
00:42:01,462 --> 00:42:04,825
Rym: Ah So they didn't trademark.

609
00:42:04,865 --> 00:42:06,530
Rym: there were the phrase bullet time.

610
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,580
Scott: until then you even saw video games employing bullet time.

611
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,740
Scott: They would have like video after the majors came out.

612
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:22,155
Scott: there were a lot of FPS is and third-person games where you would push your button and like the game would slow down for a Short amount of time to allow you to like you know aim or follow three.

613
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:23,179
Scott: does it too right where it's like?

614
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,599
Scott: right anyway What was I saying?

615
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:30,404
Rym: Something about bullet time.

616
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:34,739
Scott: oh another thing the matrix did is that I don't know it definitely probably wasn't the first.

617
00:42:35,604 --> 00:42:37,959
Scott: Cuz remember Toy Story wasn't that much older than the matrix.

618
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:51,544
Scott: To have CG stuff like that was obviously CG stuff and people together in the same scenes And having a watched it yesterday That's probably the.

619
00:42:52,046 --> 00:42:58,328
Scott: it holds up enough like it's that some of the CG stuff holds on But is like borderline not holding on.

620
00:42:58,348 --> 00:42:59,050
Scott: it's like it's like the.

621
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:02,020
Scott: it's just over the line of still being okay.

622
00:43:02,421 --> 00:43:05,814
Scott: Some of it like the robot the sentry robots that are like cutting open the ship.

623
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:08,919
Rym: yeah, they don't look that great They don't look the greatest.

624
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:13,151
Scott: There are some other things that could be that like.

625
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:19,679
Scott: but the scene for example where like he touches the mirror And it's getting all over him that still holds up mostly just fine.

626
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:25,560
Rym: well Cuz I can remember Terminator 2. that effect was pretty easy to do compared to like more complex stuff.

627
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:31,134
Scott: Yeah, but Terminator 2 it was one object like inserted into the scene whereas.

628
00:43:31,154 --> 00:43:31,595
Scott: This is like.

629
00:43:31,635 --> 00:43:41,046
Rym: It's covering his body and yeah looks like you watch old TV shows with early compositing and every time they show like a Monitor or display of any kind.

630
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:45,540
Rym: the camera always has to be at a fixed angle because they couldn't do real-time tracking yet.

631
00:43:45,863 --> 00:43:47,078
Rym: Yeah, yeah stuff like that.

632
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:51,439
Scott: And the other thing is it the matrix the way they combine?

633
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:56,435
Scott: Right there have been lots of movies that had lots of guns in them before the matrix.

634
00:43:56,515 --> 00:43:57,699
Scott: right fucking commando.

635
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,125
Scott: Yeah, plenty.

636
00:43:59,145 --> 00:44:04,951
Scott: There's no shortage of big total recall has a lot of oh, yeah No short digga digga digga digga digga digga digga digga guns.

637
00:44:05,052 --> 00:44:05,614
Scott: No shortage.

638
00:44:05,674 --> 00:44:06,980
Scott: I'll have you some fun, right?

639
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,442
Scott: There is no.

640
00:44:07,482 --> 00:44:15,571
Scott: yeah, there's no shortage of those movies in existence, but for some reason the matrix Something about the audio design and also.

641
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:18,240
Scott: I don't know I can't put my finger on exactly what they did.

642
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,825
Rym: You know what it's like.

643
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:24,836
Rym: it's like how when you played counter-strike That was the first time I shot a gun in a game and whoa it felt like a gun right.

644
00:44:24,856 --> 00:44:34,498
Scott: there's something about the way they did the sound design on the sounds of the bullets the sounds of the bullets hitting things the music they played during the scenes if any right.

645
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:38,989
Scott: the Visual impact of bullets on things right.

646
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:43,580
Scott: and it's most notably in the scene where you know they come into the building.

647
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:45,147
Scott: Right he goes through security.

648
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:46,312
Scott: He's got a bunch of guns.

649
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:56,136
Scott: then they start playing that propeller heads track Shoot up everyone in the lobby right and then the scene Shortly after that where they're in the helicopter.

650
00:44:56,156 --> 00:45:00,298
Scott: He's got the minigun and the Right and he shoots up.

651
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:02,189
Scott: basically I don't know how he doesn't hit Morpheus in that scene.

652
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,603
Rym: that makes no sense cuz he's really good at what he's doing I guess.

653
00:45:04,623 --> 00:45:08,500
Scott: yeah sure I just I. he lights up that room with the minigun.

654
00:45:09,021 --> 00:45:14,840
Scott: I have always liked the aesthetic and it's just someone how they have the slow motion and the minigun bullets are hitting the water.

655
00:45:15,082 --> 00:45:17,140
Scott: The sprinkler system went off after they hit the bomb.

656
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:22,395
Rym: I have always liked someone wielding a minigun in a movie no matter what right in any context.

657
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:29,211
Rym: Terminator 2 with the minigun That worked for its time, but this was the best minigun I'd ever seen.

658
00:45:29,231 --> 00:45:29,472
Scott: it was.

659
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:34,866
Scott: it's just so much more impactful and Powerful.

660
00:45:34,946 --> 00:45:35,835
Rym: I just want to make a video now.

661
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:42,679
Scott: that is like the American cinema in any other movie right and then the helicopter crashes into the side of the building.

662
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,417
Scott: yeah All right, it's a little die-hard esque at that point because they're all up on the rooftops and shit.

663
00:45:47,658 --> 00:45:57,112
Rym: yep This movie just it scratched a lot of varied itches all in the same film And it is very rare to have a movie that does that.

664
00:45:57,715 --> 00:45:58,598
Rym: that is that is done.

665
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:07,726
Scott: well They're also just so many things in the movie that are now become like just part of vernacular like Woman in the red dress.

666
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:10,419
Scott: yeah, it's like there's a netrunner card called woman in the red dress.

667
00:46:10,982 --> 00:46:13,090
Scott: Right it's like people say that it has a meaning.

668
00:46:13,311 --> 00:46:17,362
Scott: right what other things You know?

669
00:46:17,783 --> 00:46:20,733
Scott: they're always talking on the telephone right which is for all.

670
00:46:20,773 --> 00:46:25,833
Scott: the telephone the cell phone that they had in that movie For you the Nokia phone where you everyone wanted that phone.

671
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:26,436
Rym: you couldn't.

672
00:46:26,476 --> 00:46:27,320
Rym: phones weren't coming.

673
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:34,631
Scott: They never sold that phone in the US as far as I'm aware where you push the button on the side and it goes Right as opposed to a flip phone where you open it.

674
00:46:35,455 --> 00:46:35,876
Scott: I couldn't get.

675
00:46:35,957 --> 00:46:36,660
Scott: I wanted that phone.

676
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,302
Scott: I couldn't get it.

677
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:42,078
Rym: yeah remember in when this movie came out the vast majority of people did not have a cell phone.

678
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:44,160
Scott: cell phones Were so it was a high-tech deal.

679
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:50,820
Rym: Yeah, like we didn't have cell phones until like two years after the matrix came out, but it was very fascinating.

680
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:50,920
Scott: how?

681
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:56,260
Scott: They're like discs like physical discs were still a thing in this movie.

682
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,810
Scott: Yeah, right because they it was to 1999. but telephones right.

683
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:02,579
Scott: hackers like telephones hacking or like.

684
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:04,335
Scott: you know That's the whole thing right.

685
00:47:04,477 --> 00:47:14,660
Rym: you know This is not that long after the era where phone freaking worked like I Legit used a red box to make free long-distance calls from Cedar Point when I was in middle school.

686
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,000
Scott: So it's like your brain is in some simulation while your body is in the real world.

687
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:26,500
Scott: But you need to find a simulated phone a telephone a simulator of a telephone in the simulation.

688
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:39,023
Scott: You can use that to talk to people who are not in the simulation and communicate with the real world Via this digital telephone program Right.

689
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:50,560
Scott: and then you can also use it to transport your brain out of the simulation to the real world Via a fake telephone, which is just a program I guess right.

690
00:47:51,563 --> 00:48:02,040
Scott: and meanwhile the agents Right the bad guys are AI programs That have run amok and have no existence in the physical meat space.

691
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:08,020
Scott: There are just programs in the simulation like AI bad guys that just actually have real intelligence.

692
00:48:08,582 --> 00:48:13,839
Rym: And agent Smith like Hugo Weaving is that character that is an iconic character for all time?

693
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,149
Scott: well I mean look at these actors right.

694
00:48:15,169 --> 00:48:19,534
Rym: so Keanu Reeves already had a career And now Keanu Reeves like John wick is like.

695
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:23,092
Rym: John wick is Probably like the matrix in terms of.

696
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:24,700
Rym: I will watch it over and over and over again.

697
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,280
Scott: I mean we saw the trailer for I'd haven't seen any John wicks But I saw the trailer for the one that was a new one when we went to see us, right?

698
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:34,111
Scott: Yeah, right the one with the horse, and it basically just looked like the matrix.

699
00:48:34,252 --> 00:48:37,384
Scott: Yeah, it's the Just matrix.

700
00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:39,070
Rym: no because instead of simulation.

701
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:48,640
Rym: It's more like magical realism like what if there are Assassin wizards who made a deal with the devil, but the devil is just this dude who runs a hotel for assassins?

702
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,489
Rym: It's hard to explain.

703
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:52,100
Scott: It is the matrix aesthetic though, right?

704
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:54,585
Scott: Hotel and whatever?

705
00:48:54,805 --> 00:48:55,728
Rym: yeah, but it's a different.

706
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:56,791
Rym: It's not cyberpunk.

707
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,276
Rym: It's a different as you'll see.

708
00:48:58,476 --> 00:49:00,282
Rym: you'll see you'll see these movies You'll see what I mean.

709
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:00,744
Rym: anyway.

710
00:49:00,764 --> 00:49:05,740
Scott: in addition right in addition to the simulation philosophy the AI gone wrong.

711
00:49:06,081 --> 00:49:06,924
Scott: You know thing.

712
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:08,047
Rym: yeah is also.

713
00:49:08,368 --> 00:49:09,632
Scott: You know you know humans.

714
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:15,915
Rym: You know being farmed for their energy Environmental thing, but it makes it does the same thing terminator 2 did.

715
00:49:15,955 --> 00:49:17,020
Rym: it definitely makes it clear.

716
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:20,633
Rym: Humans kind of fucked up in the AI fought back in self-defense and here.

717
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:21,336
Rym: We are mm-hmm.

718
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:27,557
Rym: Anyway anyway if you haven't seen the matrix how hasn't seen the matrix?

719
00:49:27,778 --> 00:49:28,320
Rym: I imagine?

720
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,519
Scott: there I'm just gonna tell everyone you've all seen the matrix go see it again because why not I?

721
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:43,177
Rym: Imagine there are younger people listening to GeekNights or out there who have not seen the matrix and might be turned off by The fact that the people who talk about the day told the most the movie is older than they are.

722
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:47,886
Scott: it is a 20 year old movie and 20 has not seen that has.

723
00:49:48,046 --> 00:49:58,400
Rym: tend to be the shitty edgelords who are now our age But are still shitty edgelords or people who are talking about it to bring up red pill and pull you into the in cello sphere.

724
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:01,713
Rym: So you like those kinds of people will reference it.

725
00:50:02,035 --> 00:50:02,758
Rym: people will probably.

726
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:07,580
Scott: what's funny Is that the the the edgelords in the real world are like yeah?

727
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,679
Scott: You got to take you know the red pill to see what's really going on.

728
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:16,358
Scott: But meanwhile the edgelord in the movie - wanted to take the blue pill and now know what's going on.

729
00:50:16,438 --> 00:50:18,349
Scott: Yeah Movie was right.

730
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:19,998
Scott: edgelords don't want to know the truth.

731
00:50:20,481 --> 00:50:25,805
Scott: Edgelords are all about believing in lies and having blissful ignorance bad and traitorous.

732
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:35,523
Rym: so if you for whatever reason have not seen the matrix as Long as you're okay with a lot of guns being used in a really awesome Cinematic way.

733
00:50:35,543 --> 00:50:38,072
Scott: it's weird for how many guns you use how little like blood there is.

734
00:50:38,152 --> 00:50:40,883
Scott: it's literally just bullets and people falling over When they get hit.

735
00:50:41,064 --> 00:50:43,900
Rym: yep, John wicks very similar except for a very few spits.

736
00:50:43,981 --> 00:50:45,740
Scott: No, there's not a lot of guts and blood or anything.

737
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:54,351
Rym: Yeah Well actually John wick in the matrix of something else there will be a whole bunch of goons that die That don't matter that much, and there's no blood.

738
00:50:54,673 --> 00:50:58,687
Rym: and then there's like the boss fights John wick and the matrix both do that.

739
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:06,350
Rym: John wick will murder like a thousand Russians And then he'll have a long Snipe one person from far away.

740
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:06,792
Scott: They don't even know.

741
00:51:06,812 --> 00:51:08,521
Scott: you're there like go go 13.

742
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:13,600
Rym: Uh yeah normally, but John wick is not being an assassin for normal reasons.

743
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:16,610
Rym: He is doing it because it's personal for revenge.

744
00:51:17,213 --> 00:51:18,056
Scott: You could still do it.

745
00:51:18,316 --> 00:51:18,718
Scott: go go 13 style.

746
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,967
Scott: It's a little safer a little more effective.

747
00:51:21,088 --> 00:51:21,690
Rym: Yeah, he won.

748
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:28,492
Rym: He would but the person he's trying to kill is Behind a whole bunch of goons like three mini bosses.

749
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:31,220
Scott: What would go would go go 13 kill all the goods and mini bosses?

750
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:31,924
Scott: I don't think so.

751
00:51:32,528 --> 00:51:34,540
Rym: uh you gotta get in the John wick universe.

752
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:35,663
Rym: It's more like an RPG.

753
00:51:35,703 --> 00:51:38,450
Rym: you gotta get through all these layers John wick.

754
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:45,588
Rym: in fact the first movie has goons like random encounters goons Mini bosses boss square boss.

755
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,374
Rym: there is a straight-up square boss.

756
00:51:47,434 --> 00:51:48,096
Rym: It's amazing.

757
00:51:48,176 --> 00:51:49,380
Scott: Oh, oh there is no spoon.

758
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,386
Scott: That's another matrix thing.

759
00:51:50,486 --> 00:51:57,076
Rym: Oh, yeah, people will say there there are people I am confident who quote there is no spoon and have no idea.

760
00:51:57,096 --> 00:51:58,020
Rym: that is from the matrix.

761
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:11,027
Rym: Nope, just like people will quote the Simpsons badges we don't need no stinking badges having no idea that that is referencing either treasure of the Sierra Madre or God in saddles.

762
00:52:11,368 --> 00:52:23,006
Rym: no no I was gonna go further back and Saddles which references treasure the Sierra Madre yes, but no I was gonna reference a movie about the Girl Scouts that I forget what it's called Girl Scouts.

763
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:27,663
Rym: we don't need no Stinking badges.

764
00:52:27,683 --> 00:52:29,387
Rym: the fuck was that movie called.

765
00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:33,202
Rym: it is called True.

766
00:52:33,222 --> 00:52:34,507
Scott: Beverly Hills never heard it.

767
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:36,053
Scott: Oh, I've heard I've heard the name of that.

768
00:52:36,094 --> 00:52:37,660
Rym: do not watch that movie.

769
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:47,274
Rym: But if you want to piss certain kinds of people off if someone ever quotes treasure of the Sierra Madre Say to them with a straight face.

770
00:52:47,695 --> 00:52:50,000
Rym: Haha true, Beverly Hills and see how they react.

771
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:56,180
Scott: Also if you haven't seen treasure of the Sierra Madre you should see that that is some fucking good movie.

772
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:59,640
Scott: Yep, and if you haven't seen Blazing Saddles it that is also a fucking good movie.

773
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:03,175
Rym: Yep, it holds up better than a lot of those movies, but it's got flaws.

774
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:04,400
Rym: It's a product of its time.

775
00:53:04,921 --> 00:53:10,418
Rym: Yeah, it is better than other movies that are a product of that time, but it is still.

776
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,100
Rym: it's not great.

777
00:53:12,806 --> 00:53:13,458
