00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,032
Rym: It's Wednesday July 10th 2019.

2
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:12,056
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:14,365
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:20,270
Rym: We are judging Anime by its cover the summer 2019 anime that we have not watched.

5
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:22,548
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,673 --> 00:00:31,473
Scott: So back in the day way back in the day, New York like 1857 1940 something.

7
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:35,724
Scott: Yeah, there were parades in New York all the fucking time.

8
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:36,647
Scott: You didn't really mean.

9
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:37,790
Rym: what else do you do back then?

10
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:43,610
Scott: Sure, but like back in those days you had you started to do something really great to get a parade.

11
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:49,874
Scott: But like if you were just a fancy person like a king or something and you visited New York You would get a parade.

12
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:56,950
Scott: if you did something like win some Olympic gold medals You would get a parade right now again because there was nothing else going on.

13
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:09,330
Scott: Like you're bored and then someone's like hey this Kings in town right nowadays Right the bar that there's much fewer parades Okay, and and the bar for getting a parade is so much higher.

14
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:14,910
Rym: I mean what the Rangers got won by winning Lord Stanley's car so you can win one.

15
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,961
Scott: Basically, they're almost these days almost every parade.

16
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:21,472
Scott: I think the last parade that I can remember Happening.

17
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:23,961
Scott: I'm sure someone might find one on Wikipedia or something.

18
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:27,915
Scott: I'm like list of parades, but the last parade I remember being in New York City.

19
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:31,768
Scott: That was not sports related was when the Pope visited.

20
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:32,430
Rym: No, we gotta be clear.

21
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,290
Rym: We're not talking about like the Puerto Rican Day Parade like.

22
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,556
Scott: We're talking about the actual right.

23
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:39,464
Scott: so if you don't like the ticker tape, right.

24
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:42,939
Scott: if you're not in New York City You had to realize there is an area downtown.

25
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,786
Rym: There's a Wikipedia page that lists everyone.

26
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:45,248
Rym: ever, right?

27
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:55,850
Scott: So if you if you don't know New York City Right Battery Park is at the bottom of the city and you go north a little bit on Broadway It's called Battery Park because there were batteries of cannons there.

28
00:01:56,171 --> 00:02:02,879
Scott: Anyway, it's called and that stretch of Broadway is known as the quote Canyon of Heroes And then it ends at City Hall.

29
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,416
Scott: and what you do is if you did something really fucking awesome You get your.

30
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:08,889
Scott: you get a parade that goes down that little bit of road.

31
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:12,490
Scott: Oh, dude, it's real narrow and everyone throws shredded paper out the window.

32
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:19,646
Rym: This is great because the list of them there aren't that many These days there are that I want to list the first few because they're really funny.

33
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:29,635
Rym: So the first one 1886 October 28th The Statue of Liberty was dedicated and people just had an impromptu parade like it just happened Sounds good.

34
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:31,044
Rym: that started the tradition.

35
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:32,351
Scott: That's the bar That's like.

36
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:35,079
Scott: that's how great a thing has to be to be parade worthy.

37
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:41,004
Rym: three years later in 1889 the centennial of George Washington becoming the first president.

38
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:51,958
Rym: Oh Okay, uh Admiral Dewey returning from Manila Theodore Roosevelt returning from his African safari That's not that that's a pretty low bar that one.

39
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:53,664
Scott: That's the US Olympic Games.

40
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:55,731
Rym: athletes returning in 1912.

41
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:59,170
Rym: There you go, not even winning just coming back because the Olympics were kind of new back.

42
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:00,584
Scott: Let us hear a bigger deal then.

43
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:10,655
Rym: Yeah General Pershing coming back from the with the commander of the American Expeditionary Force Edward Albert the Prince of Wales Daining to visit.

44
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:15,010
Scott: Yeah, that's why I say a lot of them are like fancy person the marshal of France.

45
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,519
Scott: That was a lot of the visit ones were before there were planes.

46
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,707
Scott: visiting a place is a big fucking deal right?

47
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:29,741
Scott: Yeah Titanic before it crashed Sending off parade, but they basically they slowed.

48
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,728
Rym: it looks like they slowed down in the 70s, right?

49
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,310
Scott: So the reason they slowed down at least as far as I'm aware is not like a specific mandate or anything.

50
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:43,610
Scott: it's simply that you know a Humanity has achieved a lot less things that are parade worthy.

51
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:47,169
Rym: Yeah, there hasn't been an Apollo like moon landing in a while, right.

52
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:51,350
Scott: And be even if you did something worthy, right?

53
00:03:51,470 --> 00:04:04,523
Scott: So for take for example Like Michael Phelps if Michael Phelps who won a huge mountain of gold Olympic medals had just been born 50 years earlier he would have gotten one or more parades.

54
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:08,716
Scott: Yeah, right but in you know 2015 whatever.

55
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:12,830
Scott: whenever he won his you know pile of medals and when was the last Summer Olympics 2016?

56
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,592
Scott: I don't remember.

57
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:17,745
Scott: I mean in the point is who would show up for the Michael Phelps parade?

58
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:22,610
Scott: who would even show up for the American Summer Olympians parade, right?

59
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:23,834
Scott: It's like you will.

60
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:25,764
Scott: people would not turn out for that.

61
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:29,761
Rym: in the 70s There were a grand total of one two, three, four five six of these.

62
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:30,765
Rym: Yeah in the 80s.

63
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:31,910
Rym: There were four.

64
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:33,641
Rym: Yeah in the 90s.

65
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:34,385
Rym: There were a few more.

66
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,010
Scott: right now you got it.

67
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:43,322
Scott: You know, I I will take all the New York sports team parades As long as they're not Yankees or Islanders.

68
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:46,550
Rym: or I was about to say these 70s were in order.

69
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,438
Rym: Yes, Apollo 14.

70
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:49,422
Rym: Yeah, Apollo 15.

71
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:53,882
Rym: Yeah, uh Some bicentennial operation sale thing with sailors.

72
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:59,590
Rym: Yeah Yankees winning the World Series Yankees winning the World Series and Pope John Paul the second day.

73
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,590
Scott: I see I was tired, you know, then the Pope visiting all I get over 81 the Iranian hostages being released.

74
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:05,554
Scott: That's one of them.

75
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:09,028
Scott: yeah, right but the point is Oh 86 the Mets right?

76
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:16,863
Scott: Yeah I was like, it's like right, you know, I was thinking I was like I was there at the parade for you know The women is a lot of World Series.

77
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:21,223
Scott: Yeah, you don't say yeah It's almost like there are great baseball teams like that evil team.

78
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:22,709
Rym: I like the evil teams.

79
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:30,959
Scott: It's like yeah, the women's team won the World Cup which is way, you know, that's like American All right, so New York level stuff.

80
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,950
Scott: you happen to get in New York parade because it's New York.

81
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:49,059
Scott: I mean the last three the last seven were sports victories right - Yankees Giants Yankees Giants World Cup World Cup, right, but the World Cup ones are significantly better because that's a world accomplishment Not a New York us-only account.

82
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:57,690
Scott: I mean the Super Bowl is a world accomplishment kind of Right, but I'm thinking like what the fuck do you have to do to get a parade?

83
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,250
Rym: Well, like you said it's like one higher honor come back from Mars, right?

84
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:02,792
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

85
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:05,362
Scott: Like what honor aids, right?

86
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,510
Scott: How great do you have to fucking be?

87
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,170
Scott: It's like you could win the Nobel Prize and not get a parade.

88
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,421
Rym: There are a lot of people win the Nobel Prize and don't get this parade.

89
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,250
Scott: I mean like you have to be an American.

90
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:19,423
Scott: Yeah, a lot of how many Americans win the Nobel Prize a lot of Nobel Prizes.

91
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:21,450
Rym: Sure Obama won a Nobel Prize.

92
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,173
Scott: Pray no praise.

93
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:23,715
Scott: or Obama.

94
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:28,390
Scott: to get a New York parade is like it's like harder than like almost anything.

95
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,341
Scott: Like sports are like the only reasonable route because it's like.

96
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:35,850
Scott: it's just like the bar of accomplishment and heroism required.

97
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:37,924
Scott: So it's just so high.

98
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:38,810
Scott: Here's another list.

99
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,702
Scott: You have to be like an all-time great human to be like this.

100
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:43,790
Scott: Is there even a person alive?

101
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,430
Scott: Right that you can just say, you know what that is a person who is alive and they're just so great that they are parade worthy.

102
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:55,002
Rym: So I learned some great facts about human being alive in 2019 anyone.

103
00:06:55,042 --> 00:07:00,622
Rym: so there's a list of People who were so fucking awesome.

104
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:02,130
Rym: they had more than one.

105
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:11,310
Rym: There's not many Richard Byrd Bobby Jones, Amelia Earhart, Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle, John Glenn.

106
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:16,641
Rym: Yeah, not many people In terms of sports teams honored the Yankees have had nine.

107
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:19,010
Scott: Yep, and they've won a lot more than nine World Series.

108
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,743
Scott: Yeah, they didn't get a parade every and we've rescinded one of them.

109
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:24,288
Scott: Well, there's the Nazi guy.

110
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:35,790
Rym: Yeah Yeah, these are the Marshall pretend but basically the Collaborator shithead who ran the martial law state that was later occupied by the Nazis.

111
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:40,144
Rym: They removed the plaque and they were like, nope, that parade does not count.

112
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:41,470
Scott: His name's still on the ground over there.

113
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:42,848
Rym: Uh, apparently they tore it up.

114
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,453
Scott: It's over there.

115
00:07:44,894 --> 00:07:47,182
Rym: Oh, they are planning to tear it up.

116
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:48,907
Scott: They said they wouldn't haven't done jack shit.

117
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:50,870
Rym: Yeah Duh-duh-duh.

118
00:07:52,211 --> 00:08:04,110
Rym: Apparently so France is giving a shit because they removed in 2010 the last remaining plaque with his name on it in the entire goddamn country, and New York still has one plaque.

119
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,357
Scott: We should go vandalize it.

120
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:09,707
Rym: We'll get a jack full disclosure if it gets vandalized.

121
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:10,530
Rym: We did not do it.

122
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,778
Rym: We did it but we didn't do it Jack.

123
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:16,250

125
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:29,043
Rym: Yep.

126
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:31,349
Rym: You live-streamed yourself doing it?

127
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:39,090
Scott: All right, the point is is like if you set your goal in life to get parade good fucking luck.

128
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:41,515
Scott: It's like what honor.

129
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:45,188
Scott: like you I can't imagine an honor greater than having the parade for you.

130
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,497
Scott: Yep It's like what it's like you you know.

131
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:55,870
Scott: yeah, Emily was saying at the parade like yeah She can make an animation and win like every single Oscar at every single category and would not get a parade.

132
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,297

Scott: Steals a parade for himself.

136
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:03,875
Rym: It's for him.

00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:05,204
Scott: Now there's a parade for Lupin.

138
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:05,990

140
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:12,485

Scott: You should never go to anime expo Just like you shouldn't go to New York Comic Con or San Diego Comic Con.

147
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,482
Scott: It's a con like it's not like all these small medium sized anime cons.

00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:46,062
Scott: Anime expo is bad.

154
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:49,621
Rym: But anime expo is not just bad for those reasons It's also really badly run.

155
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:50,930
Rym: It's a miserable experience.

156
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:54,923
Rym: Like every year you can watch Twitter and see the garbage fire.

157
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,628
Scott: There is no reason to be at it.

158
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,898
Scott: and this year They were earthquakes.

159
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,180
Scott: Yeah That's why I don't go to- I've never been to California.

160
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,365
Scott: earthquakes are part of the reason.

161
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:03,309
Rym: I mean the oh the.

162
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:06,461
Rym: I've never been to California except for work.

163
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:07,645
Scott: I've been there for the airport.

164
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:08,970
Rym: I've been there for work a bunch of times.

165
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,849
Scott: I might go there soon, but I gotta wait for earthquake season to stop.

166
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:13,655
Rym: I mean earthquake.

167
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,464
Rym: the earthquakes are not causing that much damage because of regulations.

168
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:16,985
Rym: Uh-huh.

169
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,530
Scott: I still don't really want to be in one.

170
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:20,698
Rym: Yeah, I've been in minor earthquakes.

171
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:21,281
Rym: They're a big deal.

172
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,188
Scott: Yeah, I've been in New York earthquakes.

173
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:23,650
Scott: They're fine.

174
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,155
Rym: Yeah I remember that earthquake.

175
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:29,210
Rym: cuz I was on the street and suddenly people come running out of the buildings and running out of the subways.

176
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:32,570
Scott: You know, it feels like someone, you know, like stomped around a little bit.

177
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,929
Rym: Well, cuz if you're on the street, you know, feel it.

178
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:39,313
Rym: But if you're in a old building in New York the buildings sway a lot Cuz they're old.

179
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:45,577
Scott: It just feels like someone was stomping around on the on the roof above you and like hey cut it out And it's like no that was the whole world joking.

180
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:46,601
Rym: So I'm gonna go through.

181
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,167
Rym: some of the news is from Anime Expo.

182
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,494
Rym: number one Katsuhiro Otomo.

183
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:52,545
Scott: If you don't know who is the creator of Akira.

184
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:58,523
Rym: Yep Directed part of robot carnival done a lot of stuff.

185
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:00,490
Rym: He is getting a new movie, right?

186
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:04,575
Scott: So I guess he's running out of money because this is like the least You think about.

187
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:16,458
Scott: most of the creators of great animes and mangas are known for being Ultra prolific work of workaholics like Satoshi God made as many movies as he could while he was a lot He's like, uh, he just freaking cranked him out like a machine.

188
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:20,170
Scott: Yeah, but Otomo is famous for barely making fucking anything.

189
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:30,170
Scott: He made a handful of Really awesome artsy indie mangas the most famous of which is like Domo right, which is great.

190
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:33,870
Scott: And then he made Akira which is like one of the best manga ever created.

191
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:38,204
Scott: He sort of did some work on this manga called Legend of Mother Sarah.

192
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:39,850
Scott: That was sort of published in the u.s.

193
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,856
Scott: It's really hard to get and he was actually by another dude metropolis Really involved in metropolis.

194
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:46,318
Scott: that much.

195
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:48,165
Rym: Well, he was involved.

196
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:49,008
Scott: His name was on it.

197
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:54,930
Scott: Yeah, right But basically he made the Akira movie, which is great, even though it you know only bore some resemblance to the manga.

198
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:59,508
Scott: And then he didn't make anything fucking else until steam boy, which was not great.

199
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:02,239
Rym: Nope See boy was really pretty but it was not good.

200
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,260
Scott: and then he sort of I don't know how much he worked on the frame Cup noodle freedom thing.

201
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,547
Rym: Yeah, it's like I don't even know Everything is great because it just has a line at the end that says it's like the things they picked.

202
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,801
Rym: to associate Him with is pretty funny quote.

203
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:19,026
Rym: He also collaborated on Harmageddon barely erosion Z.

204
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:23,516
Scott: Oh, yeah Reagan Which everyone forgets.

205
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:24,799
Rym: who remembers spring in?

206
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:27,124
Rym: yeah metropolis cup noodle?

207
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,490
Rym: and he pira the little vampire.

208
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,680
Rym: We've reviewed it on fucking GeekNights.

209
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,241
Scott: Yes.

210
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:35,087
Rym: I don't remember you don't remember he.

211
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,030
Rym: it was not great.

212
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:40,221
Rym: Okay, the point is Like show with the cute little vampire.

213
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:41,608
Scott: I don't remember this anyway.

214
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:55,136
Scott: Otomo is like this dude who's clearly shown the potential to create like all-time great parade worthy works 2011 tonight on GeekNights the cute he Peter and the fun walk food Both.

215
00:12:55,317 --> 00:13:02,450
Scott: the point is Akira is parade worthy But Otomo is not because since then he's done jack and shit basically, right?

216
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:06,470
Scott: So they're redoing Akira in HD, which I guess is a good thing.

217
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,450
Scott: You know, you know, but he's making another thing called the orbital or something.

218
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,370
Scott: Yeah, the image the promotional image looks very Otomo esque and involves.

219
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:27,970
Rym: All I think of Otomo is there's someone probably wearing a helmet of some kind Standing in the middle of a big mostly empty thing holding something maybe with a motorbike, right?

220
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:32,915
Scott: So, I mean, I hope it's good obviously because I love Otomo when he's good.

221
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:39,957
Scott: Yeah, I really wish the thing is if you look at the things he's worked on animation wise You know where he's had heavy involvement.

222
00:13:40,358 --> 00:13:43,348
Scott: He's only had the one hit where it was based on a manga.

223
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:46,918
Scott: Yeah, right But all of his manga which he I don't.

224
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,249
Scott: he's made any manga since Akira none of note or significant.

225
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:54,670
Scott: anyway I really wish he would just make manga cuz he's basically never made a bad manga.

226
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:55,536
Rym: You know what?

227
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:56,080
Rym: I was about this.

228
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,570
Rym: This is the monkey's paw situation.

229
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,296
Rym: You're like, I wish Otomo would make more stuff.

230
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:02,849
Rym: The monkey's paw is like he's gonna make another mediocre movie, right?

231
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,144
Rym: Makes great comedy anime and what he ends up like.

232
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:13,559
Rym: all he wants to do is make a really boring Terrible live-action stuff that nobody likes.

233
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,506
Scott: It's like if Otomo would just make a manga.

234
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:20,050
Scott: it would be great Hopefully and then he could make an anime based on that manga.

235
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:26,108
Scott: Yeah, right and then that would hopefully also be great, but you just go and direct to you know movie and it's not.

236
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:26,389
Scott: you know.

237
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:27,773
Scott: I I can.

238
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:35,837
Scott: I can hope it's great, but I'm going to set expectations low because that way I won't have any disappointment or Excitement or anticipation.

239
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:38,428
Scott: Yep, you know if it is I do hope it's great though.

240
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:38,950
Scott: That'll be awesome.

241
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:49,351
Rym: so in another news from Expo promare, which Imagine just kill la kill - right promare is a new animated movie from studio trigger Who.

242
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:51,277

243
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:54,025

Scott: It's gonna be shown at Otakon and tickets are on sale to go see it in a theater near you.

246
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:01,949
Scott: I bought a ticket to see it in the theater near me.

247
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,678
Rym: I think I'm gonna be out of the country when it's in the theater.

248
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:07,086
Scott: I think it's showing sometime in October.

249
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,290
Scott: There's only two days.

250
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:08,932
Scott: It's showing.

251
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:11,201
Scott: the weekend date is a dub showing.

252
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:12,827
Scott: in the weeknight showing is a sub.

253
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:24,450
Rym: So make sure you go see it on the weeknight after work like I am so crunchy roll now There's an update to this crunchy roll adult swim and a bunch of other people are joining HBO max, right?

254
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,566
Scott: So if you don't know about this Let's say you want to do legal streaming and you don't want to pirate anything.

255
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:30,570
Scott: You don't have cable, right?

256
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,589
Scott: So if you want if you're interested in HBO your options are HBO go.

257
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:36,635
Rym: Well, your options are your parents.

258
00:15:36,815 --> 00:15:44,309
Scott: HBO go exactly you don't have HBO go means you have cable and you log in with your cable And then you can watch HBO.

259
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:51,030
Scott: HBO now is a thing that lets you watch some limited amount of HBO mostly Game of Thrones.

260
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:52,930
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much the Game of Thrones.

261
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:58,220
Scott: HBO now effectively is Pay money to watch Game of Thrones if you don't have HP.

262
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:05,698
Scott: if you can't get HBO go or pirate or do anything else I mean, yeah, right And I don't even care about Game of Thrones right.

263
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,150
Scott: HBO max is a new thing.

264
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:14,150
Scott: It's basically going to be like a real streaming service just like fucking Netflix and you pay for it.

265
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,199
Scott: And not only do you get a bunch of HBO stuff?

266
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:18,450
Scott: You're also gonna get all the Warner stuff, right?

267
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,180
Scott: You're gonna get Cartoon Network stuff.

268
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:29,929
Rym: You're gonna get all kinds of Almost all the Warner media brands like Warner Brothers stuff new line DC entertainment CNN TNT TBS Out of the box.

269
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:38,010
Scott: If they put enough content into this out of the box then like that is a Netflix level competitor right there.

270
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,037
Scott: you're gonna be choosing between like.

271
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,529
Scott: I'm gonna be switching between Netflix this one and the Disney one like.

272
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:46,134
Rym: I hate that.

273
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,700
Rym: I'm gonna get the Disney ones.

274
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:50,270
Scott: I'm gonna switch between the three depending on what I'm watching.

275
00:16:50,531 --> 00:17:01,833
Rym: So what's interesting is because they're gonna bring a bunch of content from their subsidiaries Subsidiaries because one of the subsidiaries of Warner media is otter media and I otter media owns a whole bunch of crap Mm-hmm.

276
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,041
Rym: I can think they own crunchyroll.

277
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:04,047
Scott: I don't know.

278
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:12,916
Rym: So all this stuff is gonna be on HBO max, but to be clear here I'm gonna just quote anime news network crunchyroll.

279
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:20,128
Rym: clarified with anime news network on Wednesdays like recently that only select content from crunchyroll Will be available on HBO max, right?

280
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,750
Scott: For crunchyroll, so if you want deep cuts from crunchyroll, you're gonna have to get crunchyroll.

281
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,630
Scott: But if you just want to watch some anime and you have HBO max, you're gonna see some anime.

282
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,629
Scott: Yeah, right.

283
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:37,609
Scott: So if you're the kind of person who maybe watches like the top animes and not the deep cuts then maybe HBO max.

284
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:39,251
Scott: or you Know Netflix or any, you know Any of this?

285
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:47,842
Rym: all the services seem to have a little bit anime going on with my my current strategy of I have Netflix I have crunchyroll and I have pirate Bay.

286
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:48,284
Rym: Yeah.

287
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,650
Scott: I mean, that's what I have right now.

288
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:56,376
Scott: But I also I do know I have those two things and I have Criterion Channel, but yeah, I do Movies and shows on Amazon.

289
00:17:56,436 --> 00:18:02,752
Scott: I haven't been watching crunchyroll recently, but the problem is I have an annual membership So I can't cancel and uncancel Right.

290
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:06,506
Scott: So but I probably won't renew it until there's a show I need to watch on crunchyroll.

291
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:12,703
Rym: So lastly is Neon Genesis Evangelion we talked about at length is now available on Netflix.

292
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,750
Scott: We talked about that last and yeah Wednesday show.

293
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:37,241
Rym: I just want to point out if you for whatever reason listen to GeekNights, but haven't watched Evangelion we don't need to re-review it because back in 2007 we reviewed Neon Genesis Evangelion and We in 2008 did a full deep final thoughts spoilers everywhere Like talk about Neon Genesis Evangelion.

294
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:49,090
Rym: So rather than us do this again You can just go listen to those old GeekNights episodes And you'll get the weird novelty of Scott doing the opening introduction to the show instead of me because we used to alternate back in 2007.

295
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,122
Scott: you get some old ass 2007 news.

296
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:53,286
Rym: Oh, well, what's the news here?

297
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:58,382
Rym: Let's see in the news Michiko and Hachin is an anime and Tatsunoko vs.

298
00:18:58,422 --> 00:19:00,189
Rym: Capcom is going crazy.

299
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:00,550
Rym: go nuts.

300
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,578
Rym: I don't know what that news was.

301
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:06,400
Rym: and for the other show Let's see, we review Neon Genesis Evangelion in the news.

302
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:08,526
Rym: Speed Racer and Boku Ra.

303
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:09,810
Rym: I think Boku Rano came out.

304
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:10,733
Rym: Maybe we?

305
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:11,917
Scott: I don't know.

306
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:13,843
Rym: None of these links are valid anymore.

307
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:14,866
Rym: They're all 404s.

308
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,930
Rym: There's no way to find out what the hell.

309
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:17,496
Rym: Oh Boku Rano.

310
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:20,487
Rym: Oh, you know our news was Boku Rano.

311
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:25,300
Rym: the anime Changed the ending because the manga ending was too depressing.

312
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,266
Scott: the manga and anime are significantly different.

313
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:28,470
Scott: I watched all the anime.

314
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:29,474
Scott: I have all the manga.

315
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:30,278
Scott: I haven't read it all yet.

316
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:31,945
Rym: Yeah, that anime is pretty good.

317
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:32,408
Rym: Actually.

318
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:34,277
Rym: It's way good I could watch it again someday.

319
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,630
Rym: go finally this weekend.

320
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:41,068
Rym: If you are not aware there is a convention in Connecticut in Hartford called Kinetic Con.

321
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:43,764
Scott: now Isn't it usually the same weekend as San Diego Comic Con?

322
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:48,010
Rym: Yeah, it moves around But it's this coming weekend like this weekend.

323
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:57,895
Rym: All right If you live within like a couple hours drive San Diego Comic Con if you live within a couple hours drive or a reasonable train ride You should go to Kinetic Con.

324
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:02,810
Rym: It's a pretty good con, but it's not a fly to Connecticut convention.

325
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:04,335
Rym: Don't fly there.

326
00:20:04,595 --> 00:20:06,220
Rym: But if you live nearby, you should probably go.

327
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:09,310
Scott: Okay, San Diego Comic Con is the week after that.

328
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,322
Scott: It's the 18th through the 21st.

329
00:20:11,463 --> 00:20:12,590
Rym: So we used to go every year.

330
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:15,410
Rym: We used to run the entire like panels and workshops department.

331
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:23,183
Rym: We were tired from that position our good friends cold guy and they took over Running that area and they do a really good job.

332
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,870
Rym: The convention is just as good as it's always been.

333
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,302
Rym: So we'll probably return someday.

334
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:30,870
Rym: We can't return because actually Scott has something going on this weekend.

335
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:35,390
Rym: So it would have been just me and the only just me con I do is Zenkai Con.

336
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:38,610
Rym: But if you're anywhere near Connecticut, you should totally go to this con.

337
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:41,928
Rym: They got a lot of Steven Universe voice actors and it's always a good time.

338
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:53,318
Rym: also, frankly Other than PAX's and magfests like weirdly enough Kinetic Con is like one of the better Tabletop gaming cons you could go to in the East Coast.

339
00:20:53,399 --> 00:21:06,030
Rym: Oh, yeah, like you wouldn't think that you wouldn't even know that It is a better gaming con just inside of this con than most gaming cons are And gaming is just like one area of the con.

340
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:15,249
Rym: But anyway, it's time for things of the day.

341
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:15,710
Rym: What do you got?

342
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:24,400
Rym: So here are some people presumably in Russia But maybe not right, you know I also got a Russia vibe based on the with the laughter and based on that old ass control.

343
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:25,907
Scott: So what's the name of the Twitter account?

344
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:26,871
Scott: men's corner?

345
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,840
Scott: Yeah, I don't know but I don't know about this Twitter account.

346
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,805
Rym: Oh this Twitter account probably just agree I don't know.

347
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:35,734
Scott: But the point is the video in this tweet is excellent.

348
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:41,781
Scott: There are two stupid people on train tracks walking Yeah Don't.

349
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:50,656
Scott: and reason the train which the camera is inside of is Sneaking up on them and they don't hear that train even though it's going slow.

350
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:51,720
Scott: trains are loud slow.

351
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:59,740
Rym: Well electric trains that are not accelerating or decelerating that are relatively modern and well maintained are actually really quiet.

352
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:02,460
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, uh hilarity ensues.

353
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:04,025
Rym: Yeah, it's a real good tweet.

354
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:08,760
Scott: very very you're not gonna get much more laughter in 25 seconds than you are with this one.

355
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:17,380
Rym: So thing of the day So my thing of the day, I'm like 70% sure this is real because I've seen some shit in my life.

356
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:23,608
Scott: I mean, I it could be real could be fake but in the absence of proof that it's real I have to lean towards fake.

357
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,260
Scott: even though I don't I'm not gonna say a hundred percent.

358
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:32,631
Rym: I feel like it's real because I have encountered Similarly weird situations like that.

359
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:38,680
Rym: saxophone house is clearly fake and Sephiroth house is pretty but this feels like it happened.

360
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:52,840
Rym: but basically, you know, there's a place on reddit where people will semi anonymously ask for relationship advice and The most common reason you would go to that place is to see what a shit show other people's lives are so you can feel Better about yourself, right?

361
00:22:52,840 --> 00:23:02,260
Scott: Well, I mean the person who wrote this relationship advice post says they originally Posted on our a ITA which if you don't know is am I the asshole?

362
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:10,808
Scott: Yeah, which is another great place to go on reddit because basically you have people who either are assholes or People who are.

363
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:12,119
Scott: you know in situations?

364
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,729
Rym: Entangled with assholes how we should make one.

365
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:17,480
Scott: you get to go there and you get to basically vote on.

366
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:19,508
Scott: You are the person posting this.

367
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:20,713
Scott: you're the asshole or no?

368
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:23,446
Scott: the person you're posting about is the asshole Assuming you're not lying.

369
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,034
Rym: I feel like we should make the spin-off.

370
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:25,919
Rym: Am I that guy?

371
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,489
Scott: Okay, yes, you're that guy if you have to ask well To ask if you're that guy you're not that guy.

372
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:39,460
Rym: like I have almost anyone who's ever worried about a guy.

373
00:23:39,924 --> 00:23:41,340
Scott: You're not that probably not that guy.

374
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,859
Rym: Yeah, that guy has no idea that he's that guy and hates all the other that guys.

375
00:23:46,722 --> 00:23:50,094
Rym: So anyway, I'm just gonna read the very beginning of this because you got to read it.

376
00:23:50,174 --> 00:23:55,350
Rym: It's it swerves Very delicately and in a wonderful way that I love.

377
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:58,619
Rym: I'm female 34 pregnant and struggling with my husband.

378
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,814
Rym: male 35 lack of support regarding my regarding my in-laws behavior.

379
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,300
Rym: How could I prove the situation?

380
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,073
Rym: I've been happily married for 10 years.

381
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:07,979
Rym: I'm very much in love.

382
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:14,080
Rym: I'm not sure of the blah blah blah, but basically quote the relationship with his parents has been strained.

383
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:17,439
Rym: They own a number of mouse figurines.

384
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,507
Rym: Okay That's already.

385
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,959
Scott: a lot of people collect stuff.

386
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,660
Rym: They're made from different materials and one is a giant papier-mâché one called Timothy.

387
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:33,480
Rym: Okay, each of them has a whole character profile with backstories personal pressure preferences family relations, etc.

388
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:40,064
Scott: Okay So they not only do they collect but they take it the extra mile with fan fiction and all of them are seen as part Of the family.

389
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,660
Rym: Timothy is my in-laws grandchild.

390
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:46,493
Rym: What unsettles me is that they constantly talk to them and with other my.

391
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:55,440
Rym: they constantly talk as them With other mice or each other and guess they used high-pitched tones and they'll talk in this manner that little children to use for instance.

392
00:24:55,601 --> 00:24:58,313
Scott: Okay, so that they have mental problems and they need help.

393
00:24:58,675 --> 00:24:59,760
Rym: My father will squeak.

394
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,429
Rym: My husband's father will squeakingly say my tummy hurts.

395
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:05,740
Rym: I am hungry while wiggling a mouse plushie in my face.

396
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,185
Scott: Assuming this is true.

397
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:11,700
Scott: He's got problems that needs help, but the entire family is in on the whole family needs.

398
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:20,248
Rym: Oh, all I'm gonna say is that You're if you read this like usually when you read these stories the swerve is like oh wow Your husband's an incel.

399
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,119
Rym: or like yeah, your wife is cheating on you.

400
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,900
Rym: This one swerves in a direction that I did not anticipate.

401
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,020
Scott: Yeah, it's so weird and so specific that it's it's like it would be a very creative person who made this up.

402
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:33,083
Rym: Yeah like I'd like.

403
00:25:33,123 --> 00:25:39,940
Rym: I feel like if someone made this up they need to make a choose your own adventure video game because they would Come up with like the best adventure book ever.

404
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,466
Scott: Yeah with their creative mind.

405
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:46,543
Rym: in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book is apparently still pages of pain By Troy.

406
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,191
Scott: it is the first book ever.

407
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:52,439
Scott: Well the first novel ever which is the tale of Genji.

408
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,315
Rym: so let's get right into it.

409
00:25:55,436 --> 00:26:03,171
Rym: because Usually as you know, we do a YouTube show on Scott's YouTube channel Which you subscribe to called judge anime by its cover.

410
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:05,419
Scott: We used to do it in anime Boston as a panel.

411
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:13,531
Rym: Yep One year we were like, let's review all the anime that's coming out based on a screenshot And it was really fucking funny and really fun to do.

412
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:16,000
Rym: and we're like, we're really accurate.

413
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:18,394
Scott: Yeah, it's I'm not gonna say we're 100% accurate.

414
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:20,343
Scott: we get stuff wrong But we're still.

415
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:23,914
Scott: the thing is people, you know who say oh, we're super dumb.

416
00:26:23,954 --> 00:26:24,576
Scott: It's first of all.

417
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:26,663
Scott: Yeah, we admit we're super dumb We don't know stuff.

418
00:26:27,145 --> 00:26:33,490
Scott: and be you know, it's like yeah, we got something super wrong, but percentage-wise We're getting mostly hits.

419
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,073
Scott: It's like yeah.

420
00:26:34,113 --> 00:26:38,360
Scott: Look I got ten bull's-eyes You know two in the red and like one missed the target.

421
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,693
Scott: It's like really you're gonna say that I suck cuz you know.

422
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:41,296
Scott: to mr.

423
00:26:41,317 --> 00:26:41,840
Scott: Target three.

424
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:51,020
Rym: So normally we do temples as we do this with high production value is not as a podcast But just as a YouTube thing, but we've had a lot of travel and we've been busy So we did not have time to do that, right?

425
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,650
Scott: Well, I mean as we speak the summer season of anime is happening.

426
00:26:55,051 --> 00:27:01,411
Scott: episodes twos and threes of different shows are coming out Like within a few days I have avoided or watching.

427
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:05,652
Scott: so we're already late even though we haven't watched any anime Some of these shows.

428
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:07,276
Rym: so we could do this and we haven't done it.

429
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:09,380
Scott: We didn't have any other show idea for tonight.

430
00:27:09,902 --> 00:27:12,534
Scott: I didn't have any video stuff set up in my house.

431
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:16,950
Scott: Yeah, the weather is You know, the AQI is not so good.

432
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:19,840
Rym: Yeah, the air quality is pretty bad today in New York, right?

433
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:24,880
Scott: So yeah a variety of circumstances like alright, let's be lazy bums.

434
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:27,599
Scott: We are no reason to deny that we are lazy bums.

435
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:35,740
Scott: We will make one episode the some, you know The summer episode of this show just as a GeekNights episode and not make a video.

436
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:43,280
Rym: So what I will say if you like this go subscribe to Scott's YouTube channel because we've been doing this on his channel for a while.

437
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:51,550
Scott: Yeah I guess our policy is like whoever edits the video posted on their channel because we don't have the GeekNights YouTube channel You can give them to me to post on mine cuz mine has a lot more followers.

438
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,300
Rym: Yeah, whatever mine makes my makes money.

439
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:59,777
Rym: Yeah, actually my youtube channel covers the Libsyn bills now like completely, okay, that's actually.

440
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:00,660
Rym: I was surprised by that.

441
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,059
Rym: I looked I didn't notice for a while that it's been making money.

442
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:07,860
Rym: Right, but I know the listener is smart because that money is almost entirely YouTube, right?

443
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,879
Rym: Well not read anymore YouTube people who pay for YouTube.

444
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:17,212
Rym: YouTube gives us money because they watched our videos because anyone who's not paying for YouTube I assume is blocking ads.

445
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:22,059
Rym: if you're not blocking ads block ads like ad block works on YouTube guys.

446
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:25,126
Rym: So, let's get right into it.

447
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:26,811
Rym: Scott can't really see this.

448
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:28,898
Scott: unless I got my own I got my head.

449
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:30,701
Rym: so Dr.

450
00:28:30,804 --> 00:28:33,969
Rym: Stone One day I'm already feeling this.

451
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:34,752
Rym: It looks good.

452
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:38,972
Scott: You build his confesses to a girl He loves and the sky is filled with a strange light.

453
00:28:39,032 --> 00:28:40,740
Scott: Everyone's touched by the light is turned to stone.

454
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:43,009
Rym: Oh kind of like the everyone's trapped to stone.

455
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:49,640
Scott: He breaks out and he explores a crazy world And he finds some other people who were freed from stone, but not everyone.

456
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:53,333
Scott: So basically it's like what if everyone was turned to stone.

457
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:55,320
Scott: it's like that old sci-fi on the whole planet.

458
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:15,772
Scott: But then some people were slowly released over time and then the main character gets released and he's not necessarily the first or only to Be released but you then explore the world of what happened And when everyone was turned to stone for an unknown amount of time and then unstoned Through the eyes of that character great concept definitely unique.

459
00:29:15,993 --> 00:29:20,151
Rym: Yeah, the art looks like interesting at least Some kind.

460
00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:31,634
Rym: Yeah, this reminds me There's that old sci-fi movie where the comet goes over and anyone who looked at the comic is permanently or comet is permanently blinded the Next day and then just like the world disintegrates.

461
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:35,860
Rym: Mmm This is definitely worth a one episode watch.

462
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:43,240
Scott: Yeah, this is one of those Concept ones but the concept is I think way more unique and way better than a lot of the other concept ones.

463
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:50,447
Scott: Yeah, like we just talked about Bocorano, which is great because this is like a no concept is a lot less Unique and interesting than this one.

464
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:51,571
Rym: Yeah, this one.

465
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:53,077
Rym: I definitely want to watch.

466
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:55,906
Rym: Oh, yeah Dungeon, I'm getting a.

467
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:59,636
Scott: my guess is that it will be pretty close to like the abyss show.

468
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:00,940
Rym: Oh, yeah, which I really liked.

469
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:02,624
Rym: Dungeon knee day.

470
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:04,268
Rym: I will mote a metal.

471
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:06,855
Scott: No, that's all you're gonna pronounce all these now.

472
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,600
Scott: Yeah, don't you know day?

473
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,024
Rym: I will mote a metal.

474
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:12,953
Rym: No, wah matcha got a root out.

475
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:16,791
Scott: Okay - Okay - sequel to another dungeon.

476
00:30:16,812 --> 00:30:23,880
Rym: second season of a show We didn't watch that has vague fantasy like Goku do kind of not Goku more like Sarah more serious than Goku?

477
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,371
Rym: No, maybe it just looks like serious people.

478
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:28,200
Scott: No one listening to this knows what Goku do is.

479
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,176
Rym: Yeah, I said I feel like people listening to this are the only people who know what Goku do is.

480
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:36,628
Rym: Okay Uh, I see a girl with fox ears.

481
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:42,440
Rym: I see generic the most generic possible characters This shows.

482
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:50,715
Rym: This show is probably as Generic and fantasy and self-insert as Utawarerumono.

483
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:51,378
Rym: Mm-hmm.

484
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:52,000
Rym: Remember that show?

485
00:30:53,022 --> 00:30:59,313
Scott: just know the English translation is Something I have heard of which is is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?

486
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:00,075
Scott: Oh, that's what.

487
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:00,838
Scott: that's what it is.

488
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,046
Rym: It's probably genero comedy.

489
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:03,768
Scott: You've never heard of it.

490
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:04,992
Scott: Yeah, I heard of that.

491
00:31:05,052 --> 00:31:05,634

492
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:10,506
Scott: It's uh, yeah No one the reason.

493
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:13,980
Scott: I've heard of it and then have not bothered to investigate any further beyond the title.

494
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,251
Rym: No one talked much about season one in our circle.

495
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:18,174
Rym: So I assume season two.

496
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:19,760
Scott: I think it was a long at first, right?

497
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,946

Scott: This looks like firemen.

502
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,568
Scott: They're not actually so.

503
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:41,886
Rym: if you read that the text in year 198 of the solar era in Tokyo special fire great brigades are fighting spontaneous human cabal I'm less interested in this now.

504
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:48,209
Scott: Yeah, they look like firefighters, but actually they're just doing some you know action Kind of stuff.

505
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:48,511
Rym: Okay.

506
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:57,852

508
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:08,912

Rym: This looks great.

517
00:32:30,264 --> 00:32:33,700
Rym: It looks like historical drama set in like Viking times.

518
00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:41,956
Rym: Uh-huh Thor Finn is son of one of the Vikings greatest warriors But when his father is killed in battle by a mercenary leader, he swears to have his revenge.

Rym: I will say this the people I know who have talked about it and liked it are people who know and like the prince of nothing okay, that that's a. That could be a warning sign to certain people, but I feel like this is gonna be good.

524
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:06,051
Rym: Sure I feel like this is worth a couple episodes to see if it's good.

525
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,400

545
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:09,212
Rym: This is self-insert bullshit.

546
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:10,600
Scott: Yeah, this is one of those.

547
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,025
Scott: I mean, this is our main character.

548
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,695

Scott: There's like assassination.

553
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:27,340
Scott: classroom and battle royale are two that come to mind immediately.

554
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:35,179
Scott: But in this one You know that addition of main character being weakest boy in the class situation is what you know.

555
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,706
Rym: It makes it like no it even talks about stats.

Scott: The Translation is how heavy are the dumbbells you lift?

563
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,460
Scott: It seems like every character is a girl except for one.

564
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:16,100
Rym: It could be a harem one girls getting a little chubby and she decides to join a gym tries to find a casual gym meet someone else who is a weightlifter and It's like a romantic seems like an excuse to draw lots of athletic girls with boobs.

565
00:35:16,622 --> 00:35:18,509
Scott: Yeah, and then have people look at that.

566
00:35:18,529 --> 00:35:19,794
Scott: It even says comedy ecchi.

567
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:20,215
Rym: Yep.

568
00:35:20,737 --> 00:35:26,540

569
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:27,625
Scott: That's what you're in for.

Rym: It'll say no chicken bow rail zeppelin grace notes.

572
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:35,860
Scott: It's like a steampunk.

573
00:35:36,582 --> 00:35:37,404
Rym: I think so.

574
00:35:37,745 --> 00:35:59,496
Rym: when Lord El Melio the second the later waiver valve is a lot of Capitalized words here gets asked to claim his inheritance over Adara castle Assembled contestants in something they all have ridiculous Gundam names Luvia Galita and felt must compete in a game of wits to win a castle.

575
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:05,600
Scott: It's another one of those, you know typical right scenario type shows.

576
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:10,240
Scott: It just has this sort of dark steampunk Victorian ish aesthetic going on.

577
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,342
Rym: Yeah, I feel like this show is gonna have the thing where aesthetically it looks a little bit like La.

578
00:36:15,362 --> 00:36:26,880
Rym: I don't like Dura Dura kind of characters, but I feel like it's gonna be super generic and Feel like it's going somewhere and feel like it's the second time Rym said generic.

579
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:28,870
Rym: I feel like it's not gonna go anywhere though.

580
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:30,840
Scott: put a counter on this on the non screen.

581
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,943
Rym: This is the generic.

582
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,628
Scott: every time Rym says generic ding.

583
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,332
Rym: This show is going nowhere.

584
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,017

585
00:36:37,037 --> 00:36:47,890

00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:51,700
Scott: it's so weird.

590
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,407
Scott: We're seeing these second seasons of things.

591
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:59,169
Scott: even though we've been judging anime for like over a year now I don't remember ever judging the first season of this.

592
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,338
Rym: Maybe we have and I just forgot maybe they were so generic No one talked about them.

593

Scott: Yeah, I don't know but it had.

594
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:08,457
Scott: it would have been on the any chart if they were just airing right.

595
00:37:08,717 --> 00:37:15,218
Scott: so that first season Was either so long ago or so mad that we just brought breezed over it without even thinking about it.

596
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:17,148
Rym: Yep I feel like that happens a lot.

597
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:19,420
Scott: Anyway, it's this comedy slice-of-life romance.

598
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,797
Scott: It's just like a cute little show with you know, kids middle school ish romance.

599
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:25,539
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

600
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,272
Rym: All right, here we go kind of town.

601
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:29,546
Rym: Oh, astra Space travel.

602
00:37:29,606 --> 00:37:30,734
Scott: I think it's Astra cuz.

603
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:31,318
Scott: it's like space.

604
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:36,070
Rym: Yeah Commercially viable high school students embark to planet camp.

605
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:42,224
Rym: an unforeseen sentient light sphere warps them to outer space Stranding them.

606
00:37:42,244 --> 00:37:45,920
Scott: This is the second show where a whole class of kids has been warped to another place.

607
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,670
Rym: Is that is that the theme for this summer?

608
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,694
Scott: have to work together?

609
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:51,079
Rym: This does not look like.

610
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,959
Rym: however Here's the big difference in space.

611
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:59,198
Rym: This one does not appear to have the generic shitty self-insert character from a light novel.

612
00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:00,000
Scott: not in the description.

613
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:04,080
Rym: This looks like it has the ensemble cast of co-equal main characters.

614
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:11,895
Scott: One person with the spiky hairdo does drawn much larger than the other characters Yeah, but I feel like he will be a character as opposed to a self-insert.

615
00:38:12,197 --> 00:38:15,712
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I think this show could be good.

616
00:38:15,732 --> 00:38:20,930
Scott: if the mystery of how they were Teleported is like a good terrible secret of literally space.

617
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,314
Rym: There's a it edges into.

618
00:38:22,354 --> 00:38:23,297
Rym: they were 11 territory.

619
00:38:23,357 --> 00:38:24,140
Rym: They find an old.

620
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:26,420
Scott: It's a group of kids in space.

621
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:34,560
Rym: Yes They they find an old unmanned spaceship and they must stay strong and manage their limited resources and remain united in the darkness of space.

622
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:35,884
Scott: Maybe it is.

623
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:36,847
Scott: they were 11.

624
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,474
Rym: I feel like this could be like only as they were nine.

625
00:38:39,495 --> 00:38:45,133
Rym: Yeah, I Am much more interested in watching this than the other show.

626
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:47,160
Rym: That is a class of people sent somewhere.

627
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:55,634
Scott: I mean, I think they just because Because it doesn't have the self-insert light novel You don't know it just not in the description but the just the space theme.

628
00:38:55,674 --> 00:39:06,149
Scott: I think it gives it that extra boost Yeah, versus the teleported to another fantasy world where there are stats on the people Speaking of stats.

629
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,020
Rym: isekai cheat magician.

630
00:39:09,344 --> 00:39:19,086
Rym: It's even in the title centers around a guy and a girl like a transported to a fantasy world in that the guy is a normal person who has higher than Average reflect.

631
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:20,960
Rym: Yeah, not even to talk about this.

632
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,800
Scott: Oh, so you get transferred to a fantasy world where you're a badass, which is basically what Superman is.

633
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,147
Scott: It's like I'm creeped on.

634
00:39:27,187 --> 00:39:33,751
Scott: he's a normal bro, but he comes to earth and he's a bad In the title, there's no way this is good.

635
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:34,273
Rym: It's got.

636
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:36,158
Rym: yeah, it's not even gonna talk about it.

637
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:41,340
Rym: Mm-hmm Toharu kagaku no accelerator The espers, okay.

638
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:42,884
Rym: No, this is bad too.

639
00:39:42,904 --> 00:39:48,300
Rym: the espers of Academy City are classified into six levels where level zero lacks power.

640
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:52,500
Rym: Well level five possesses an overwhelming amount of isekai crap.

641
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:58,080
Scott: It's so weird how like these RPG elements started out as stats on like a war game D&D character sheet.

642
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:06,393
Scott: Then they edge their way into video games which lacked all the agency of the player in storytelling But still had the combat of sort of.

643
00:40:06,494 --> 00:40:07,620
Rym: but no the nerd actually.

644
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:14,480
Scott: But now they've even taken that away and they're bringing the RPGs with stats, right?

645
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,300
Scott: I mean, they've been in anime for a while now, but it's like it feels like it's getting even worse.

646
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:22,493
Rym: Imagine imagine an anime based on Final Fantasy.

647
00:40:22,573 --> 00:40:24,220
Scott: It's like you're a Final Fantasy character.

648
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,112
Scott: You don't know that your strength is 47, right?

649
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,312
Rym: But here Dragon Ball Z it was a joke right in Dragon Ball Z.

650
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:37,253
Scott: They joked like oh your power levels are 9,000. but here it's like nope, literally not a joke.

651
00:40:37,293 --> 00:40:38,336
Scott: Your power level is 9,000.

652
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:39,400
Rym: You know what this is?

653
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,804
Rym: It's a Final Fantasy.

654
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:45,037
Rym: 6 was turned into an anime and the anime was literally just every fucking fight.

655
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:50,678
Rym: Yeah, that's it Yeah, and then like looking at the character screens and like oh my his strength is too higher.

656
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,280
Rym: now We can cast white and it'll do a little more damage.

657
00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:04,480
Scott: Whoo, at least anime like get baggers with abstracted away and like oh we're going we've made it to the next level of the spooky Tower As opposed to like literal god damn it Astro boy.

658
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,441
Scott: He leveled up mid, you know, now he has X thousand horsepower, but it wasn't like, you know That was.

659
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:10,705
Scott: that's the thing that makes sense here.

660
00:41:10,745 --> 00:41:12,110
Scott: It's literally like aha.

661
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:12,993
Scott: Your stats are up.

662
00:41:13,635 --> 00:41:15,100

00:41:16,262 --> 00:41:17,328
Rym: Uchi no kono.

664
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:18,193
Rym: Tame nara.

665
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:21,988
Rym: They are a wah moshikashi Tara.

666
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:30,670
Scott: Wow, no Tausaru Kamo shit and I in English it translates to if it's for my daughter I'd even defeat a demon lord.

667
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:37,160
Rym: I'm already not Super into this because I see a lot of really young girl characters.

668
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:40,128
Scott: So a dude goes into the forest.

669
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:47,880
Scott: He comes across a devil girl who's not doing too Well, he's gonna leave her there to die, but nope takes her home become her adopted father.

Scott: She's really cute.

671
00:41:51,124 --> 00:41:53,100
Scott: It seems kind of like a moe situation.

672
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:59,103
Rym: Yeah, I worry this is gonna be scary moe and I worry that if it's based on a manga It's okay.

673
00:41:59,243 --> 00:42:00,949
Scott: I brought a demon girl home.

674
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:03,437
Scott: I didn't bring an actual little human girl.

675
00:42:03,497 --> 00:42:03,718
Scott: Huh?

676
00:42:03,878 --> 00:42:07,069
Rym: My worry Thousand years old.

677
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:10,620
Rym: I guess my worry is that this might be a bunny drop situation.

678
00:42:11,123 --> 00:42:12,571
Scott: It's bunny needs demon drop.

679
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:14,079

680
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:18,617
Rym: Alright, oh, I'm just gonna read the English names of these.

00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:22,431
Rym: from now on No maidens in your savage season.

682
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:23,234

00:42:37,651 --> 00:42:38,715
Rym: one of them says sex.

689
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:44,719
Rym: I think it's just a Slice-of-life funny like it's just a story about girls and sex.

690
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:46,786
Scott: Oh, is this like it depends?

691
00:42:46,866 --> 00:42:47,930
Scott: isn't no automata show.

692
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:51,180
Scott: Maybe it seems like it might be romance slice-of-life drama.

693
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,532
Rym: I think it's a serious.

694
00:42:52,552 --> 00:42:54,804
Scott: These are girls Based on a manga.

695
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:58,213
Rym: Yeah, this could possibly be good.

696
00:42:58,373 --> 00:43:00,840
Scott: Yeah, it seems like this is not, you know a perverted situation.

697
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,062
Scott: This is like an honest, you know legit, you know Situation.

698
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,793
Rym: Yeah, this could be an earnest show about sexuality and growing up.

699
00:43:09,535 --> 00:43:09,896
Scott: Mmm.

700
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:11,240
Rym: I don't see a lot of warning signs.

701
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,224
Scott: Yeah, that's a good deal.

702
00:43:12,244 --> 00:43:12,606

705
00:43:17,613 --> 00:43:21,852
Scott: I see ladies It doesn't say the word Yuri on it.

706
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:28,695
Rym: Yeah, not that that would be bad But you know the genre stuff people saying it's a coming-of-age female protagonist school club like.

707
00:43:28,755 --> 00:43:28,956
Scott: yeah.

708
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:29,919

00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,699
Scott: What the what would you do if you got transported into a video game?

717
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:52,600
Rym: We know in one hand every video game I play the mom that that is a fantasy world.

718
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,560
Rym: The moms are the only good characters and you can't date them or really interact with that, right?

719
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:05,690
Scott: So this does have the leg up and that the mom is gonna be there like all the time because that's the point of the Yet another RPG stat show yet another.

720
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:09,020
Scott: well, my life is actually literally a video game now.

721

725
00:44:25,993 --> 00:44:29,768
Rym: you could be great But I don't think this is gonna be that.

726
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:33,280
Rym: I think this is gonna be another stat based garbage.

727
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,896
Scott: It's mostly just gonna be like silly and try, you know pandery and that sort of thing.

Rym: Probably not that good.

756
00:46:13,028 --> 00:46:15,681
Scott: Well as a show that takes itself seriously Yeah isn't?

757
00:46:15,821 --> 00:46:26,502
Rym: actually that series shows gonna act like it's serious and it's going to substitute good plot and character development for upper like proper noun names of things Mm-hmm.

758
00:46:27,103 --> 00:46:27,284
Scott: All right.

759
00:46:27,304 --> 00:46:29,851
Scott: So this one looks interesting but also not right.

760
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,177
Scott: so you have it says cop craft.

761
00:46:32,558 --> 00:46:35,083
Rym: that art looks Different.

762
00:46:35,103 --> 00:46:43,053
Scott: so what I'm getting the vibe here a buddy police action series follows a detective and The alternate world night, right?

763
00:46:43,114 --> 00:46:51,080
Scott: So there's like a Girl wearing it, you know, not not the most boob armor I've seen but still not very protective armor.

764
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,817
Rym: It's panty boob armor, but it's like Naga from slayers level as opposed to like really perverted.

765
00:46:56,837 --> 00:47:00,360
Scott: It's not an armored bikini It's armored one-piece bathing suit.

766
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,560
Scott: But anyway, so you have a serious detective like imagine like guy and it's like guy.

767
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,073
Scott: Who's the guy the human and goes in the shell?

768
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:11,047
Rym: Oh God, why do I forget his name?

769
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:11,429
Rym: I don't know.

770
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:12,535
Scott: I forgot his name right now.

771
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:15,408
Rym: Yeah Why did I forget his name?

772
00:47:15,548 --> 00:47:23,900
Scott: I forgot right but like imagine a Serious detective who's you know, but the the buddy partner Togusa Togusa, right?

773
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,074
Scott: I actually was thinking that but I'm like, no, that's not right.

774
00:47:27,114 --> 00:47:27,839
Rym: Yeah, I was same thing.

775
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:41,189
Scott: I was like Togusa but his buddy cop isn't also the serious major It's a magic girl from a buddy cop is a magical girl wearing, you know Slightly not great armor where the sword.

776
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:46,007
Scott: so it's like crossing the two genres in a way But seems like she's also serious.

777
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:49,320
Scott: Like she's actually trying to solve whatever demon problem.

778
00:47:50,341 --> 00:47:53,955
Rym: Couple buddy cop except it's a fancy girl and a normal guy with a gun.

779
00:47:53,975 --> 00:47:54,839
Scott: You know what?

780
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,847
Scott: And this is a unique idea.

781
00:47:58,027 --> 00:47:59,774
Rym: It's not set in an RPG.

782
00:47:59,955 --> 00:48:01,440
Rym: I will give this one episode.

783
00:48:01,581 --> 00:48:03,046

Scott: one day he wakes up and so he's not a streamer He's someone who just uploads stuff to YouTube.

790
00:48:20,427 --> 00:48:20,809
Rym: Wait, wait.

847
00:50:54,515 --> 00:50:57,164

848
00:50:57,606 --> 00:50:59,835
Scott: right if you look at like the poster there, right?

849

Rym: Art actually looks pretty good.

851
00:51:02,749 --> 00:51:04,380
Rym: Maybe it'll be more like boogie pop fans.

852
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,964
Scott: It's three characters above them.

853
00:51:05,984 --> 00:51:11,319

Rym: They fight for the sake of humanity, but due to their horrible form will humans accept them?

855
00:51:18,802 --> 00:51:24,120
Rym: It looks pretty stylish, I guess this is another one where if anyone else tells me it's good I'll give it a watch.

870
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,675

00:52:33,876 --> 00:52:34,760
Scott: I don't anything about it.

00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,851
Scott: This is no I just know I don't need to watch it.

884
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:42,976
Scott: What happened to the other 10 symphogears?

885
00:52:43,056 --> 00:52:48,700
Rym: Fuck if I care Ensemble stars has way too many characters and it's an idol thing.

886
00:52:49,203 --> 00:52:50,171

Rym: It's a magical girl show.

890
00:52:58,281 --> 00:52:59,726
Scott: It says comedy fantasy.

891
00:52:59,786 --> 00:53:00,689
Scott: So it's like.

892
00:53:01,171 --> 00:53:06,083
Scott: I guess, you know, maybe it has the kind of feel of Risky safety.

893
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:09,915
Rym: Well, I could see that but it looks more like straight magical girl.

894
00:53:09,935 --> 00:53:13,187
Scott: Hmm So she has a curse.

895
00:53:13,248 --> 00:53:19,579
Scott: the curse is you have to live on 40,000 yen a month 365 US dollars a month.

896
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:21,426
Scott: You gotta live poor.

897
00:53:21,466 --> 00:53:23,693
Scott: you got you can live but you live somewhere cheap.

898
00:53:23,974 --> 00:53:25,800
Rym: move upstate and away from the throughway.

899
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,169
Rym: You could live pretty well on 365 dollars a month.

900
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:29,173
Scott: All right, the next one.

901
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:30,879
Scott: actually that looks like it has something going on.

902
00:53:32,301 --> 00:53:34,347
Scott: The anime will have its no bunga.

903
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:36,354
Scott: No, no, no, but no banaga.

904
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:46,459
Scott: So basically it's a dramatic sort of crazy interpretation of the story of Oda Nobunaga and his life as an early teen.

905
00:53:47,022 --> 00:53:55,469
Scott: So basically taking history and then making it really sort of outrageous and anime Turning him into a moe girl or anything.

906
00:53:55,630 --> 00:54:02,976
Rym: No, nothing like that, you know, I Don't feel like I need to give this a try because if I'm gonna give a show like that a try I'm gonna watch Vinland saga first.

907
00:54:05,061 --> 00:54:09,075
Scott: Try nights, it looks like a sports show about a high school rugby team.

908
00:54:09,135 --> 00:54:10,620
Rym: Yeah, it probably takes itself seriously.

909
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,260
Rym: It's probably really hyper accurate to the rules of rugby.

910
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,454
Scott: Mm-hmm feel like it's me about the rugby, right?

911
00:54:16,515 --> 00:54:19,246
Scott: Yeah is a cute Super young idol.
