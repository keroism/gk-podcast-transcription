1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,411
Rym: It's Monday February 4th 2019.

2
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,539
Rym: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:18,690
Rym: We are talking about cheating mostly in school with technology.

4
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:21,367
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:29,144
Scott: So get on the train to come home like you do and you know I barely notice.

6
00:00:29,465 --> 00:00:38,940
Scott: but as I enter the train right across from me is some sort of panhandling gentleman Yeah, usually you notice it enough who I completely ignore and then and go about my business elsewhere in the train.

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,440
Rym: So no warning signs no like might be a stabbing hobo saying just saying I just ignored as usual.

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,404
Scott: I just noticed.

9
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:47,191
Scott: I didn't can't even tell you what it looked like.

10
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:48,275
Scott: I just noticed there was one.

11
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:57,839
Scott: and then At the next stop as they do they get off and go to the next car because you know You already panhandle the people in this car.

12
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,657
Scott: You gotta go get some fresh some years and you know to their credit.

13
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:08,042
Rym: in this case Waiting for the next stop is the right idea because a lot of people get seriously hurt trying to walk through the subway cars like Those doors.

14
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:10,614
Rym: Oh, yeah, that is way more dangerous than people realize.

15
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:12,040
Scott: people die going between the like.

16
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:14,710
Rym: I am a pretty you're like non risk-averse person.

17
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:17,120
Rym: I would not walk through those doors of a moving subway train.

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,197
Scott: No, anyway, so it goes in the next car to get the rubes in the next car.

19
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:29,520
Scott: No and another Panhandling gentleman enters who I wouldn't have noticed because I was already in headphone land elsewhere in the car.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,707
Rym: Yep, you already assessed the situation of the train.

21
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:32,992
Rym: now, you're just headphone land.

22
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:38,945
Scott: like this gentleman was yelling Angrily and scarily Mmm-hmm.

23
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:41,580
Scott: So I'm like, well, that's definitely not the one that was just here.

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,765
Scott: That is the second one.

25
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:44,935
Scott: one got off and one got on huh?

26
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:46,040
Scott: How about that that huh?

27
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,124
Scott: You don't see that every day.

28
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:52,765
Scott: and then at the next stop that one got off And a third one got on.

29
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:55,072
Rym: so at this point is there a schedule.

30
00:01:55,594 --> 00:02:00,308
Scott: I I was three four three three stops three panhandlers Okay.

31
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:00,673
Scott: All right.

32
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:04,180
Scott: Now I'm taking notice cuz this is unusual.

33
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:10,365
Rym: Yeah, cuz like one time a second mariachi band came on to the seven train when I was coming back from flushing But that was just awesome.

34
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:14,260
Scott: I was like what - yeah, this is unusual but not yet thing of the day worthy.

35
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:21,859
Scott: Yeah, okay, so that they get off and I don't remember there may have been a break of one stop, but At most one stop later.

36
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:23,948
Scott: Kid sound fruit snacks.

37
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:26,402
Scott: Haha fruit snack kid comes All right.

38
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:30,136
Rym: The only thing that could have made this better is if the next stop was showtime.

39
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:30,638
Rym: Hold on.

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,180
Rym: Oh

41
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:56,471
Scott: After fruit snacks kid There was another hobo who I would not have noticed and I'm using hobo now instead of panhandling gentleman because this person stank big time and Creepily was like on their knees when they found a location with enough room to be on their knees in the middle of the crowded train Near me so I could smell it but luckily they got

42
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:56,692
Rym: off

43
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:58,638
Scott: when they're when their time was done

44
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,440
Rym: interesting.

45
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:05,217
Scott: So that's already for panhandling people for begging people and a fruit snack.

46
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:14,394
Scott: and then of course, yes as it was foretold At 59th and legs it was showtime showtime.

47
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:20,860
Scott: I've never been on a train With that much annoying activity that is single train ride.

48
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:24,820
Rym: Not one of them was the best possible outcome, which is mariachi band?

49
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:25,846
Scott: No There was zero.

50
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:29,351
Scott: if there was a mariachi band I would have had a complete set and it would have been like the.

51
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:30,477
Scott: it would've been like jackpot.

52
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:34,452
Rym: at that moment Everyone on the train would have been like whoo money like at that point.

53
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:36,800
Rym: Gothamist would want to interview everyone on that train.

54
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,846
Scott: Yeah, I know all the all.

55
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:40,440
Scott: the windows and the train would open and like coins would start pouring.

56
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:43,213
Scott: Yeah, you know you won complete set.

57
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:45,630
Rym: now to be fair Like don't think that Scott?

58
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:54,840
Rym: not, you know living in New York You have to like for real harden your heart to the cruel realities of an evil world Because there's no way to live your life otherwise.

59
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:57,329
Rym: But at the same time you probably vote for Democrats.

60
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:59,958
Rym: so maybe we can address the root cause of this situation.

61
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:12,803
Rym: just saying So, uh in the news actually, so we were thinking about doing a show on Overclocking and Scott asked the question because he was like, oh, that's a better show than your idea We should have.

62
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:14,149
Scott: we probably did it before though.

63
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:18,851
Rym: Yeah, so I look and sure enough We're on such a goddamn schedule.

64
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,499
Rym: This happens more often than you'd think.

65
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,260
Rym: but Well, basically whenever we have an idea that feels like oh, yeah, I wonder we ever did a show on that.

66
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:26,499
Rym: That's a good idea.

67
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:28,399
Rym: Usually we've done it either.

68
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,650
Scott: Exactly one year ago exactly exactly one year ago is tech news roundup Yeah, by the way should be coming up in like a month.

69
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:36,495
Rym: Oh, thank Jesus.

70
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:42,277
Rym: Thanks Satan I can finally do the easiest possible Monday show like two or three Monday shows for now.

71
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:43,220
Scott: It'll be tech news, right?

72
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,500
Rym: I don't think you understand how I. all I do is pull away.

73
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,971
Scott: I know my memory could be wrong.

74
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:50,040
Scott: My memory is telling me March, but it could be May.

75
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:53,412
Rym: I feel like I feel like it's between like late March.

76
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:54,436
Rym: It starts with M.

77
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:55,018
Scott: Go check it.

78
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:57,300
Rym: Yeah stupid smarch weather.

79
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:09,690
Rym: But Scott was like overclocking and I searched and sure enough we did talk about overclocking Almost exactly ten years ago.

80
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:11,958
Scott: Not nothing new to say Monday, January 19th.

81
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,810
Rym: So ten years ago and like a couple weeks tonight on GeekNights.

82
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:19,280
Rym: We explain why overclocking is no longer practical.

83
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:20,565
Rym: That's still true though.

84
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,327
Rym: It once was.

85
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:22,411
Scott: that's also true.

86
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:29,034
Rym: Yep, like back in the day of the k7 Overclocking a 600 megahertz computer to an 800 megahertz computer.

87
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:30,880
Rym: That was a big goddamn deal.

88
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,446
Rym: That was a lot of performance.

89
00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:39,058
Rym: It sure was but overclocking a 4.8 gigahertz computer to a 5.0 gigahertz computer doesn't do shit.

90
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:45,820
Rym: Nope Oh and in the news they are trying to take away Obama's Blackberry and an interview with an adware developer.

91
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:54,707
Rym: And our things of the day were reforming the FCC and something that's called freaky world war one photo which Doesn't go anywhere.

92
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,199
Rym: So there's no way to know what that picture was.

93
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,409
Scott: Maybe internet archive.

94
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,092
Rym: I will try.

95
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:01,980
Rym: I will try to find out what the for you.

96
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:10,580
Scott: If you really want things on the internet to not randomly disappear and to instead be stored in the Internet Archive Please go to archive org where you can make a monthly donation.

97
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,658
Rym: I will link to that.

98
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:19,120
Rym: So instead we're doing a show on cheating because I feel like what we said in 2009.

99
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,803
Scott: It's all Rym.

100
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:20,365
Scott: I got nothing.

101
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:21,691
Rym: Well, it's like I can update.

102
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:25,209
Rym: here is the update to the 2009 show Even though I have no idea what we said.

103
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:26,780
Rym: I'm just guessing the update is.

104
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,240
Rym: Overclocking is kind of automatic.

105
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,473
Rym: now if you just make your computer colder your chips will be faster.

106
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:43,500
Rym: if you have good chips and Doing anything more than that is great for a hobbyist, but as zero practical application whatsoever Mm-hmm, and I say zero including the idea that you might mind bitcoins.

107
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:46,099
Rym: So anyway, we're gonna get in the news because there's a big news.

108
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:51,838
Scott: Yeah, so check this out that I want to explain this in case people don't understand what happened in this news, right?

109
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:54,385
Scott: So Apple you might see.

110
00:06:54,445 --> 00:07:00,322
Scott: news is like Apple pulled Facebook certificates and then pulled Google certificates and then gave them back Right.

111
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:02,955
Scott: So here's what happened, right if you want to make apps

112
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:03,377
Rym: for

113
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:22,155
Scott: iPhone Right, you can't just install them on iOS unless you do a whole bunch of crazy hacking bad stuff because it'd be hardware and saw And I an operating system are designed in such a way that will only run software That has been digitally signed and it must be digitally signed with

114
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:22,978
Rym: the root

115
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,532
Scott: iOS certificate which is a private key that Apple owns and you could never guess.

116
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:31,380
Scott: and if you could that would be the end of iOS security.

117
00:07:31,864 --> 00:07:33,880
Rym: Now there's a lot of reasons why they do this.

118
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,920
Rym: I don't think we want to debate the like philosophical and moral and practical like reasons why people do.

119
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:47,816
Scott: They tried to do this on PCs and people were like, no Y'all won't be able to run any of my existing software or open source software.

120
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:48,840
Scott: That will never be signed.

121
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:49,827
Scott: I bought this computer.

122
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:56,816
Scott: I should be able to run whatever code I want on it But in making the brand new iPhone out of nothing they were able to enforce that from the start.

123
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:59,066
Scott: on OS X You'll see a lot of warnings.

124
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:01,740
Scott: That's like you're about to run software that hasn't been signed.

125
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:14,531
Scott: It's basically a way for them to be like make sure that this device will only run software That some authority has checked out that software to make sure it's cool Which you know, we talked about that in the past.

126
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:17,000
Scott: Yeah, but regardless the system is in place in iOS.

127
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:31,000
Scott: You can't by default or without great effort illegal, perhaps illegal definitely hacking Unofficial efforts, yeah run software that has not been approved by Apple on an iOS device, right?

128
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,380
Scott: So if you want to get your stuff in the App Store, right you have to get you know.

129
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,945
Scott: Make an Apple developer account.

130
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:48,820
Scott: you get some keys then they like sign your key with their key And then you can use those keys that you got, you know that have been signed by Apple.

131
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,408
Scott: So it's like Apple get you make a key.

132
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:52,600
Scott: It's sort of like the way you do SSL on your website.

133
00:08:53,183 --> 00:09:03,960
Scott: You make a secure private public key pair then Apple approves your key with their key and now iOS will run the software that you sign with your key.

134
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:11,740
Scott: But you can only with that software that you sign with your own key run it like, you know for development purposes.

135
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:13,988
Scott: Right, like I'm making the software.

136
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:16,939
Scott: I need to be able to edit code run on my iPhone right now.

137
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,600
Scott: Yep, just like every time I change a line of code send it to Apple.

138
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:27,500
Scott: Or you know, I need to test myself or I got a bunch of testers coming in like 20 people at my company.

139
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,785
Scott: They're all gonna test the software.

140
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:32,760
Scott: I had to distribute copies to everyone with test flight, which is the official.

141
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:40,811
Scott: It wasn't an Apple thing originally, but Apple bought it and made it official because it was the best Way to distribute your software to testers.

142
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:53,360
Scott: sometimes people, you know Well, like like I was do using some netrunner tournament software and I would get faster updates like beta updates because the person with their key Gave me in a in on their test flight.

143
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:56,892
Scott: So I was getting the you know, the software that they were signing.

144
00:09:56,952 --> 00:10:04,759
Scott: right but to actually get you're in the App Store You got to sign it then send it to the App Store where Apple will guess like approve it even again.

145
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:05,765
Scott: So we can.

146
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:10,267
Rym: I think we could actually even do a show on like code signing Instead of a show on cheating.

147
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,172
Rym: Not right now.

148
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:13,123
Rym: I don't know about right now, but okay I got.

149
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:15,032
Rym: I don't have enough to say.

150
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:16,580
Rym: I gotta think about it right regardless.

151
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:26,840
Scott: Right you you can't run software on iOS unless Apple's private key that you can never guess has in some Directly or indirectly been used to sign that software.

152
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:27,744
Scott: Right.

153
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:35,437
Scott: So even big companies like Facebook and Google Are getting their keys to make their.

154
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:37,508
Scott: you know iOS apps have.

155
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:44,480
Scott: Apple is like approving and signing keys So that Facebook and Google can make and develop and run iOS apps.

156
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:49,880
Scott: What happened is is that there's like an agreement you make with Apple, right?

157
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,640
Scott: Like there's a you know terms of service developer agreement developer account that you pay money for.

158
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,170
Rym: I won't use this to make malware that bricks phones.

159
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:58,034
Rym: I won't give this.

160
00:10:58,114 --> 00:10:59,420
Rym: I won't sign shit for other people.

161
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:00,069
Scott: It's like.

162
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:00,739
Scott: it's like yeah.

163
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:02,826
Scott: I agree that I'm not going to like

164
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:03,689
Rym: sign

165
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:17,180
Scott: a thousand copies of software and sell it in some other shop and avoid the App Store, I'm not gonna use this to make shady ass software that does certain things You know to make softer that sort of does, you know that I wouldn't get away with in the app.

166
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:27,180
Rym: Yeah, right and that dot that thing probably has a line that says out We reserve the right to revoke your certificate at any time for any reason, right?

167
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:43,490
Scott: Yeah, so what Facebook was doing at least was they had a program where they paid you money Cash money and then you would use test flight or equivalent to run software that did not get approved into the App Store But was signed with Facebook's like developer key.

168
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,891
Rym: Yeah.

169
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:45,056
Rym: No, this this suffers.

170
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:46,120
Rym: bad fucking news.

171
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,326
Rym: There's other news about that.

172
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:48,572
Scott: and everything you do is like.

173
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:52,109
Scott: they were telling you it was like a VPN But really just spying and everything your phone did.

174
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,374
Scott: Yeah, really all your traffic.

175
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:53,917
Rym: It's a whole.

176
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:55,643
Rym: there's a whole Like.

177
00:11:56,026 --> 00:12:08,340
Scott: it was basically hey pay us we'll pay you money to give us even more of your data like literally all of it from your phone and You'll have to run this software that Apple won't approve but we can get it to run on your iPhone by using these keys.

178
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:14,800
Scott: And then as soon as Apple found out about this, they're like, hey you're violating your agreement We will just revoke your keys.

179
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,320
Scott: So now once they revoke the key what happens is basically all iOS devices because they get the new updates.

180
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:26,840
Scott: Do you know - what's you know - the - the you know key database or whatever which keys are approved and not approved?

181
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,186
Scott: Yeah, right Now reject those keys.

182
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:34,660
Scott: and no no iOS devices will run those softwares.

183
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:35,462
Scott: It will still.

184
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:40,940
Scott: it will still run the official Facebook app from the App Store because that key wasn't revoked, right?

185
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:42,379
Scott: It was the developer key.

186
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:54,417
Scott: So basically everyone at Facebook who is say having to work on iOS software couldn't work Any apps that Facebook made that were like for internal Facebook use only up for iOS.

187
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:56,928
Scott: all of those Immediately stopped working on all.

188
00:12:56,948 --> 00:13:06,980
Scott: that is the part that was the bigger Impact let's say to So Google was also caught doing some shady biz and got similarly temporarily revoked.

189
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:15,325
Scott: So for example, Google had like internal only iOS apps for like doing Google stuff like, you know The only Google employee like.

190
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:16,007
Rym: here's an example.

191
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:17,172
Rym: I work for a big company.

192
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:19,380
Rym: Maybe we need an internal app on iPhone.

193
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:21,810
Rym: So anyways, an iPhone can like reserve conference rooms.

194
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:36,723
Scott: Yep, or like look up where someone's desk is Regular old App Store would use these keys to make apps that don't go in the App Store but are for their employees or for development and basically all iOS things at Google and Facebook just Refused.

195
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:40,059
Scott: you couldn't open those apps anymore or they got deleted or whatever.

196
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:45,723
Rym: Props to Apple for sticking to their guns and using the revocation Appropriately.

197
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:58,960
Scott: the cynic would say props Apple for wielding or technological power and the unbeatable power of encryption Over your competitors, but also props because the two cases they did it for seem pretty justified.

198
00:13:59,221 --> 00:13:59,803
Rym: Oh, yeah, like.

199
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:04,317
Rym: here's an app that spies on kids like okay pay money to kids to spy on them.

200
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:11,520
Rym: apples like no Yeah, so I believe they I haven't read all the fun.

201
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:17,478
Scott: I think the main takeaway really is also behold the power of real encryption.

202
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,071
Rym: Yeah You can't just crack it.

203
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:24,790
Scott: Apple Google and Facebook We're just at the mercy because of a single file.

204
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:34,522
Scott: and if that single file got out into the world Anyone who had that file could run could do anything to any iOS device like basically make it run any software They wanted.

205
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:45,367
Scott: yeah, but would have to use that power to make every iOS device that wasn't already compromised reject all existing software Yup and start signing a new one.

206
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,859
Scott: sign every step in the whole App Store with their new key.

207
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,000
Scott: I'll just have a number.

208
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,823
Scott: It's just a number.

209
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:55,193
Scott: if someone figured out that number the havoc that would be reeked.

210
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,721
Rym: and this is the exact same Technology.

211
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:01,955
Scott: without that number you are powerless before the person who has that number.

212
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:03,400
Scott: they are god of iOS.

213
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:12,679
Rym: This is the same technology that if you go to your bank's website the web browser knows that your bank Yep, because that bank knows the number and no one else does yep.

214
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:16,506
Rym: So in some other news Two numbers, maybe.

215
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:20,000
Rym: yeah prime numbers related to big ones related to big numbers.

216
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:21,585
Rym: So bitcoins a scam.

217
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:23,572
Rym: just got to make sure all kinds of scam.

218
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:25,760
Rym: Yeah bitcoins a scam in my personal opinion.

219
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:30,800
Scott: Yeah, the ones I sort when I get home you and your fiat currency.

220
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,320
Scott: So there's a story here only kind of coin I can spend in exchange for so sandwich.

221
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:37,584
Scott: That is the only coin that man.

222
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:43,672
Rym: I take this story with a grain of salt because the king's tender I'm not implying anything.

223
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:44,196
Rym: I'm not.

224
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:48,091
Rym: I'm not Saying that I have knowledge about this situation.

225
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:53,630
Rym: I'm not trying attempting to defame anyone Or libel anyone.

226
00:15:53,751 --> 00:16:01,676
Rym: I don't know any details beyond the headline But there's a story here where I my gut feeling says there are one of two things that happened.

227
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:07,233
Rym: thing one is Person legit died and company was stupid and now they're fucked.

228
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:09,038
Scott: also relating to keys.

229
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:17,200
Rym: Yeah or Option to Person may or may not have died but story is designed to hide.

230
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,920
Rym: Do you think there is a fake death either a fake death or a real death that was used as an excuse?

231
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,005
Scott: It is a fake death.

232
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:29,400
Scott: There's person is now changed from Moron possibly evil moron to genius hero.

233
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:36,180
Rym: But in either in either one of those scenarios in case two the reason for it would be and again I'm not liable or defaming anyone.

234
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,537
Rym: This is pure speculation to hide the fact that they lost 137 million dollars worth of bitcoins.

235
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,762
Rym: Yep I might be some other coin.

236
00:16:43,802 --> 00:17:01,180
Rym: I don't know or care but basically there's a great legit crypto exchange in Canada that Said it lost a hundred and thirty seven million dollars of its customers assets when its founder died and Its founder was the only human being who knew it was only in his brain.

237
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:08,560
Rym: It wasn't written down anywhere the password to decrypt the offline wallet that stored most of the money.

238
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:18,299
Rym: Yeah, so and because bitcoins and coins like them are basically Encryption and I'm waving my hands because I don't want to go through the whole what is blockchain?

239
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:18,540
Rym: again?

240
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:24,756
Rym: It's basically a bunch of magic numbers where you need another magic number to find out what those numbers are.

241
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:31,213
Rym: and because no Human being knows the magic number one The all those bitcoins are just gone.

242
00:17:31,273 --> 00:17:33,323
Scott: if you could guess that magic number Why would you?

243
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:36,480
Scott: you could just guess the with the key to all iOS devices?

244
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,660
Scott: Which would be even more valuable than the hundred whatever million dollars that are in that Bitcoin.

245
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,766
Scott: Yeah

246
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:55,880
Rym: so basically supposedly the exchange kept a bunch of like a reasonable lot of money in a hot wallet like a wallet that had the Transactions in it to do like customers are buying selling their stupid coins But they stored most of the money they own which makes sense.

247
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,080
Rym: Like this is how you would do it in an offline like secure encrypted backup.

248
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:02,314
Rym: So they only go in there if they got to like.

249
00:18:02,354 --> 00:18:06,854
Rym: bring more coins Into the hot wallet because they're selling more than they're buying like that kind of thing.

250
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:07,919
Rym: that makes sense.

251
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:16,413
Rym: But supposedly that there's like the encryption for that was just known by one person who just died suddenly and mysteriously I think in India.

252
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:21,813
Rym: and Also, they got his laptop and apparently his laptop is also encrypted.

253
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:25,105
Rym: No one knows the password to that Data encryption.

254
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,590
Rym: people were like, yep, it's encrypted.

255
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:27,233
Rym: You're fucked.

256
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:29,140
Rym: Someone's got to figure out the password.

257
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:35,739
Rym: So once again legit encryption is not beatable by most reasonable means.

258
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,912
Rym: This is why backdoors into encryption are such a bad idea.

259
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:49,414
Rym: So the story here is either company had a Terrible disaster recovery plan none and a terrible business continuity plan none.

260
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:58,677
Rym: or company straight-up scammed Possibly via murder or possibly by via taking advantage of someone's untimely death possibly by faking someone's death.

261
00:18:58,697 --> 00:18:59,519
Scott: Hopefully the third one.

262
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:04,260
Rym: Every one's really the best outside of the death because death is tragic.

263
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:10,722
Rym: But outside of that all the other aspects of this are pretty funny because this I'm saying hopefully the third one because that means no One died.

264
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:13,008
Scott: Yes means a bunch of Bitcoin morons got scammed.

265
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:23,705
Rym: That's the greatest because all positives on the fake death story It's a I feel like every time the court the stupid crypto coins come up the story is the same and the story is always Decrypt that laptop.

266
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,248
Scott: It says haha.

267
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:25,434
Scott: I got your coins bitches.

268
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:34,660
Rym: Yeah But it's like everyone involved in crypto currencies, it's just like I guess no step-by-step learning why financial regulations exist.

269
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:36,566
Scott: I just I just made myself sad.

270
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:42,926
Scott: The person probably is dead because if they ran away with the coins People you have to cut.

271
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:46,260
Scott: no because it's Bitcoin or because it's a bit of blockchain.

272
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,172
Scott: Yeah, people would see those coins being sold true.

273
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:51,180
Scott: People would know they know which coins they are.

274
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:57,734
Scott: So if someone ran away with them in a fake death They would have to sell them and they would see on the exchange those coins being unless they.

275
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:00,979
Scott: if you see the coins being sold That means they did.

276
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:12,211
Rym: unless The death fake or not was facilitated by a third party to cover up massive fraud and other theft Like maybe the exchange didn't actually

277
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:14,359
Scott: have them you would slap to see those coins being sold

278
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,979
Rym: Unless there aren't any coins

279
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:21,036
Scott: But you could see on the existing chain those coins going into that wallet.

280
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:24,280
Rym: possibly I don't know how they set it up because they have a hot wall in the gold wallet.

281
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:30,103
Rym: We have no idea how they did their stupid transactions and I didn't even read this article to see what coin it is Because I don't care.

282
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:34,760
Rym: Okay, the moral is don't use these crypto currencies don't mess around with bullshit.

283
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:50,130
Rym: So, I guess in one other news making fun of crypto currencies even further there's an article here pointing out that as of now the caught the average cost of Mining one Bitcoin is like four grand.

284
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:54,765
Rym: the value of one Bitcoin is Less than four grand.

285
00:20:55,347 --> 00:21:05,947
Scott: so it is not possible to mine bitcoins for money anymore unless you had like you decrease the cost somehow by like Stealing GPUs from people.

286
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:06,409
Rym: That's it.

287
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:11,351
Scott: Unless you're crooked or using like solar panels Unless you're crooked.

288
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:18,340
Rym: There are only two Legitimate and I'm making finger quotes ways to mine bitcoins based on this information.

289
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:27,465
Rym: My method number one is you honestly believe and my soul is laughing at this that the bitcoins you might now will be worth More money later.

290
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:29,334
Scott: So you're rude making someone else money.

291
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:35,805
Rym: Yep, or You are stealing that electricity somehow Either via corruption or whatever.

292
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:36,969
Scott: Oh steal it from your neighbor.

293
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,860
Rym: Yep, maybe get a shady deal with like a Chinese.

294
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:47,677
Scott: Hey, my Con Edison bill is like 400 a month and someone told me that's not normal and I'm like hell.

295
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:51,420
Scott: no, that's not normal Yeah, someone was like, yeah, I had that problem.

296
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,097
Scott: It was because there was an illegal studio apartment underneath my apartment and I was getting out put on their bill.

297
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:59,888
Scott: Yeah so that's the kind of shit they have it in New York.

298
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:11,800
Rym: when I moved out of an apartment a long long time ago the place I moved out of I shut down the Con Edison but they did some shenanigans and got it turned back on and I kept Getting billed for the electricity that department that apartment used for like three months.

299
00:22:12,302 --> 00:22:21,419
Scott: I wonder if there's a way I can like go into the into the building the wall and Trick the meters in the building to like give half my kilowatt hours to my neighbor.

300
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:27,619
Rym: there is a long and storied history of people messing with those meters with varying levels of success.

301
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:35,220
Rym: I Know more about that than you'd think because I had a. there was a friend of a friend Who's dead?

302
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,495
Rym: I knew in high school who fucking did that for a living.

303
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:40,763
Rym: he would come and He would go to.

304
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:48,288
Rym: he would literally in the suburbs like go to your house and you have him some cash and he'd fuck around With your meter and your electric bill would go way down.

305
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,436
Rym: and it was super goddamn illegal.

306
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:50,837
Scott: Of course.

307
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:51,700
Scott: It's super illegal.

308
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:52,969
Scott: This seems illegal.

309
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,314
Rym: the same dude also sold Satellite decryptors.

310
00:22:57,981 --> 00:23:01,493
Scott: Yeah, this dude basically dude also had a boss named Tony.

311
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:04,709
Rym: Uh, no, that was a different dude There was.

312
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,000
Rym: this guy was not mob connected.

313
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:13,900
Rym: This guy was just like low-key local shady like local shady handyman who will run the extension cord to the neighbor's house effectively.

314
00:23:15,543 --> 00:23:20,140
Rym: He would also do unlicensed electrical work Like you could pay him to fix.

315
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:24,194
Scott: When you sell the house you like Electricity cost half in his house.

316
00:23:24,295 --> 00:23:32,781
Rym: Yeah Maybe winking an odd winks is good of an audio blind bad a so you mean while you're selling the house to someone from power Company.

317
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:39,431
Rym: so this article basically goes on to say that the only people who can really mind Bitcoin profitably right now are Chinese miners.

318
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:45,764
Rym: why we're getting subsidized and or corruptly cheap electricity Via corruption.

319
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:49,300
Scott: Well, someone's paying for that still even if like the power plant is paying.

320
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,068
Rym: You know who's paying for it earth and the Chinese people.

321
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:52,650
Rym: Yeah.

322
00:23:53,192 --> 00:23:55,800
Rym: Yeah, someone's paying for it via corruption.

323
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:58,552
Scott: But Chinese Bitcoin miners are also Chinese people.

324
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:02,289
Rym: Yeah other Chinese people One person is on.

325
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,640
Rym: a large number of Chinese people are being defrauded.

326
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:10,079
Rym: So a smaller number of Chinese people can mind bitcoins and sell them to rubes in the United States is my guess.

327
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:14,470
Rym: this article has more about it, but the Coins are dumb.

328
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:24,768
Rym: Stay away from these coins because it's time for things Of the day.

329
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:26,176
Rym: What do you got?

330
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:28,505
Scott: So, you know Fonts for computers.

331
00:24:28,907 --> 00:24:30,574
Scott: They're just a bunch of pictures, right?

332
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:31,840
Scott: We've all used a wing ding.

333
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:33,740
Scott: You know the letter a could be a smiley face.

334
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:35,199
Rym: It's a little more complicated than that.

335
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:38,913
Scott: But yeah You get the idea a font could be anything doesn't have to actually look.

336
00:24:38,953 --> 00:24:42,693
Scott: the letter a doesn't got to look like the letter A. you make it look like whatever the hell you want.

337
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:51,738
Scott: Yeah, so And more, you know in recent years We've made it possible to actually like get fonts and web browsers that aren't just aerial and courier.

338
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:55,620
Scott: Yep So someone made this pretty cool website.

339
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:03,734
Scott: They made a font and in this font every letter of the alphabet is a picture of a tree But not just a picture of a tree a picture of a New York tree.

340
00:25:03,955 --> 00:25:04,920
Rym: They're really good pictures.

341
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:07,168
Scott: Yeah, because you know different parts of the world.

342
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:10,480
Scott: you got different species of trees birds plants, right?

343
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,820
Scott: So there are trees that live in New York, I guess I assume these are maybe like 26 most common New York trees.

344
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:32,384
Scott: So They made a little picture of each New York tree and also a big version for capital capital And they assign them to the 26 letters of the alphabet and you type in this box and you can see a whole bunch of New York trees.

345
00:25:32,404 --> 00:25:33,548
Scott: It's pretty good fun.

346
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:34,953
Scott: It's pretty cool.

347
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:38,209
Scott: Like artsy thing that you could put in a museum I think is a little exhibit me.

348
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:38,652
Rym: I like it.

349
00:25:38,934 --> 00:25:39,256
Scott: I like it.

350
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:48,010
Rym: So last night while we were watching literally the most boring Super Bowl I've ever seen in my life It was the worst Super Bowl ratings in ten years.

351
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:54,671
Rym: I think there were exactly three plays that occurred Really, maybe among the worst halftime.

352
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:56,780
Rym: I think it was the lowest scoring Super Bowl in history.

353
00:25:57,462 --> 00:25:58,366
Scott: No, no, I think it was these.

354
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:00,394
Scott: no, there were definitely lower ones like Super Bowl 7.

355
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:01,920
Scott: Maybe I think maybe lower.

356
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:05,050
Rym: It was the lowest scoring first half of a Super Bowl.

357
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,495
Rym: I'm pretty sure maybe probably.

358
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:08,100
Rym: uh, it was boring.

359
00:26:08,726 --> 00:26:13,260
Rym: But toward the end of it I mentioned casually to the room that magenta doesn't exist.

360
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:16,292
Rym: And of course that started a giant shitstorm because no one believed me.

361
00:26:16,794 --> 00:26:18,360
Rym: So here's the video, berries part three.

362
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:22,089
Rym: So to head this off.

363
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:28,843
Rym: This is a video that will explain to you a very fascinating phenomenon where There are colors.

364
00:26:29,565 --> 00:26:31,451
Rym: and when you think of a color, what is the color?

365
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:33,799
Rym: A color is a particular frequency of light, right?

366
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:41,040
Rym: Yep So that is every color in the rainbow has a particular frequency that'll make that color appear.

367
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:45,530
Rym: And what you what a human would see isn't that frequency?

368
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:51,668
Rym: so much as the fact that we have three types of structures in our eye That will respond- Rods, cones, and the other ones.

369
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:54,460
Rym: Well, no three kinds of cones plus rods.

370
00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:07,892
Rym: Okay And these three kinds of cones will detect different sets of frequencies and our brain Looks at the output of these three plus the output of the cones or the rods For brightness and figures out what color we should think we see.

371
00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:10,760
Scott: Right, they're sensitive to frequencies of photons.

372
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:17,058
Scott: So they get stimulated and then the stimulation goes through nerves and then your brain decides well that stimulation equals this.

373
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:24,600
Rym: Yep Now there are a number of colors that are called extra spectral colors.

374
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:29,600
Rym: The video doesn't get into that much depth about this but like look at Wikipedia There's there's deep explanations.

375
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:30,823
Rym: These are colors.

376
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:37,320
Rym: where there is there is literally no frequency of photon that will make that color appear under any circumstances.

377
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:39,448
Rym: It does not appear in the rainbow.

378
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:42,540
Rym: There is no way to make that color come out of a prism.

379
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:45,609
Rym: Yeah, anyway, no single like magenta.

380
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,796
Rym: There's no goddamn such thing as magenta.

381
00:27:47,856 --> 00:27:49,120
Scott: What's the frequency of magenta?

382
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:49,788
Scott: It's not.

383
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:56,540
Scott: it's not a frequency But what it is actually is it's just like red and blue sort of mixed together.

384
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:04,053
Scott: So some photons are at this frequency and some photons are at the other frequency and they're all packed close to each other and they hit your cones at the same time.

385
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:09,800
Scott: and So your brain is receiving like red blue red blue red blue red blue and your brain is like fuck it magenta.

386
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:13,120
Rym: So basically what's crazy is for spectral colors.

387
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:18,899
Rym: Our brain actually figures out the right color to show because if you mix two actual colors like you'll get a third color.

388
00:28:19,182 --> 00:28:20,060
Rym: You know color theory stuff.

389
00:28:20,141 --> 00:28:21,799
Rym: I hope you learn this in like middle school.

390
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:28,920
Rym: But our brain is really good at filling in and figuring this out like our brains model works really well.

391
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:32,680
Scott: Well, I mean if you think about it Like is white even a frequency?

392
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,300
Rym: No white is an extra spectral color.

393
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:39,296
Scott: White is just fucking all fucking crazy kinds of photons at all different wavelengths all at the same time.

394
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:40,700
Scott: the whole rainbow jammed together.

395
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:47,194
Scott: So a whole rainbow of photons hits your eye really fast all together and your brain just like oh my god There's way too many different frequencies.

396
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:47,699
Scott: Fuck it white.

397
00:28:48,362 --> 00:28:56,564
Rym: So basically like the moral of this video is and it explains it in enough like detail at a sufficient level that pretty much Anyone can understand it.

398
00:28:57,086 --> 00:29:00,600
Rym: magenta literally only exists in the human brain.

399
00:29:01,162 --> 00:29:07,580
Rym: Yep through multiple layers of abstraction and it is Shocking how consistent our brain is.

400
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,027
Scott: Point out the thing.

401
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:11,820
Scott: I always point out which is well known obvious and pointless.

402
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:15,220
Scott: Well, you know I could look at some red and point at it and say that's red.

403
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,697
Scott: You look at it and say that's red but there we could be seeing completely different things.

404
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:19,964
Rym: Oh Scott I feel like we're.

405
00:29:20,306 --> 00:29:26,993
Rym: it's it's high school and we're all laying Backs in the bleachers at night on the football field outside of the school.

406
00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:30,907
Rym: Yeah, one kid is smoking a joint No one else is because that's the dumb kid.

407
00:29:30,927 --> 00:29:31,389
Rym: That's right.

408
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:34,620
Rym: And we're all sitting there and we're having that exact conversation.

409
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,102
Scott: That's right.

410
00:29:35,143 --> 00:29:36,770
Scott: And you know what animals they see.

411
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,760
Scott: if we could they see like, you know, we see some ultraviolet.

412
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:39,826
Scott: We can't even see that shit.

413
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:41,536
Scott: some animal looks at ultraviolet.

414
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:42,240
Scott: They see something.

415
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:47,766
Scott: We know that they can see ultraviolet because of science and we did experiments But what does it?

416
00:29:48,188 --> 00:29:49,754
Scott: what do they see actually look like?

417
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:51,060
Scott: where the fuck we know?

418
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,950
Scott: So we just know that their eye responds to it.

419
00:29:54,090 --> 00:30:05,083
Rym: The other thing is if you watch this video You should be able to figure out on your own how those magic glasses that let colorblind people see color work Like.

420
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:08,835
Rym: you can figure that out from the information you'll get from this.

421
00:30:09,116 --> 00:30:14,460
Rym: coupled with a rudimentary Understanding of colorblindness This is just a really well done video.

422
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:14,741
Rym: Like.

423
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:20,618
Rym: they explained this in five minutes and it's a moderately complex topic and they lay all the foundations.

424
00:30:20,658 --> 00:30:21,300
Rym: a really good video.

425
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:23,107
Rym: It's like I subscribe.

426
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:26,080
Scott: Why don't we just get like seven cones up in that way?

427
00:30:27,963 --> 00:30:29,271
Rym: You know, there's some people who can.

428
00:30:29,331 --> 00:30:30,760
Rym: actually they have a fourth type of cone.

429
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,090
Rym: They can see more colors than us.

430
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:34,820
Scott: I didn't know it was cuz they had a fourth type of cone.

431
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:37,973
Rym: Some of their cones respond different.

432
00:30:37,993 --> 00:30:38,475
Rym: I forget the detail.

433
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:47,080
Rym: I don't actually know a lot about that safety cone misstated it but Theoretically we could replace our optic nerve with something that's way more sensitive or way more complicated.

434
00:30:47,702 --> 00:30:48,584
Rym: Yeah, we it's just.

435
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:53,539
Rym: it's just our brain figuring stuff out based on frequencies that detects and photons that bounced off a shit.

436
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:59,419
Rym: So in the meta moment the book club book we still we've been too busy to read anything.

437
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,530
Rym: No, read a book says ribbon Scott.

438
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,615
Rym: I haven't read a book in a while.

439
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:04,278
Scott: Oh, no.

440
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:05,584
Rym: Hi What have I been reading?

441
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:07,957
Rym: I've been reading nonfiction and like manga.

442
00:31:08,138 --> 00:31:12,729
Rym: Yeah Websites, so we're gonna read 2001 a space.

443
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:15,980
Scott: I'm gonna make an actual reminder right now because we have fucked up big time.

444
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,871
Scott: There is no running in from that fact.

445
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:19,500
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to add a reminder.

446
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,459
Scott: I'm doing it as I'm speaking right now.

447
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,593
Rym: But what I will say is that read the fucking book.

448
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:29,196
Rym: if you want to be an intelligent erudite person who knows things about things you should read books.

449
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:41,200
Rym: and While we have not yet done this particular GeekNights book club because I added it to my remember the milk thing Because reasons the GeekNights book club has been going for a long time since.

450
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:46,113
Scott: Despite that long time the number of books in the book club are depressingly low.

451
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:48,260
Rym: There are five pages of the archives.

452
00:31:49,062 --> 00:31:50,050
Rym: So that's pretty good.

453
00:31:50,192 --> 00:31:50,918
Rym: I'm gonna link to it.

454
00:31:51,802 --> 00:32:02,616
Rym: I think the way you should handle the book club club until we start reading again is go to the archive of episodes We already did for a book Read the book and then listen to that episode if history is any indication.

455
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:09,847
Scott: as soon as we finish reading 2001 Rym will immediately read 2010. yeah And I will not because what happened?

456
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:13,179
Scott: we were satisfied with my watching of 20, so let's see we did.

457
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:16,292
Rym: the Shattered Earth trilogy you we both read the first book.

458
00:32:16,453 --> 00:32:17,880
Rym: Yeah, I read a little bit the second one.

459
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:25,239
Rym: We met the hottest fictional character ever written yep, and then I immediately read the next two books because it's Evangelion and oh my god It's crazy good.

460
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:27,993
Rym: We decided to read the Wheel of Time because we had to know what the.

461
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:29,580
Scott: I decided to read the Wheel of Time and Rym.

462
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:33,696
Rym: I did go uh and we read the first book and you made it a little further.

463
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:36,183
Rym: you I read a Handful more.

464
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:38,894
Rym: you rate you got up to like hat like the beginning of the fourth book.

465
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:40,100
Scott: I want something like that.

466
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:42,448
Rym: I just kept soldiering on.

467
00:32:42,488 --> 00:32:46,945
Rym: I finished the whole goddamn thing and I know the deal went around the whole wheel I did.

468
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,114
Rym: I know the full deal.

469
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:48,780
Rym: I know what I earned.

470
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:59,680
Rym: I know what's on the other side of the Wheel of Time It's uh you know what it is a bunch of stuff happens And then eventually it just stops happening because that has tower with snake bone people in it that you never find out about.

471
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:03,615
Rym: Yep, I know a lot of details about the bone tower snake people.

472
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:06,447
Rym: the only thing I cared about There's two kinds of those snake people.

473
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:07,974
Scott: I know yeah, that's part.

474
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:08,296
Scott: I read.

475
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:09,140
Rym: I know the whole deal.

476
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,184
Rym: I know about the cannons.

477
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:11,067
Rym: I know about.

478
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:11,729
Rym: I know every.

479
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:14,539
Rym: I know everything you can possibly know about the fucking Wheel of Time.

480
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:16,583
Rym: Scott will never know.

481
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:22,040
Scott: no I will not be regretting that on my grave should have read Wheel of Time.

482
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:23,586
Rym: I feel like should have read.

483
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:26,580
Rym: the Wheel of Time is really low on the list of life regrets.

484
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,994
Scott: That will not come to my mind.

485
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:29,524
Scott: however I will say what's.

486
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:35,007
Scott: the name is so clever and somehow manages to live longer than me And he said I'm and I'm in the hospital.

487
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:43,237
Scott: if my dad was like should write with a time The I'm out living you cuz I read.

488
00:33:43,258 --> 00:33:45,700
Rym: really It gave me a gnosis.

489
00:33:46,581 --> 00:33:48,086
Rym: the one thing I will say about that.

490
00:33:48,146 --> 00:33:56,092
Rym: all that though is that I'm continuing in my policy of Never getting past the first book of any long-running series where it is.

491
00:33:56,232 --> 00:34:12,620
Rym: I unless it is done, or the author is dead one of those two has to be true and That I think will serve me well, so I'm not when another Kingkiller book comes out If it ever comes out now that I not that I even really want to read it that much.

492
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,559
Rym: But I might just to find out the second one and then dispose them.

493
00:34:16,246 --> 00:34:17,378
Rym: I would own out reading it.

494
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,476
Rym: I would only read the next one that comes out if he is dead after it is written.

495
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:23,280
Rym: I hope not.

496
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,248
Rym: he's a pretty cool guy or He says that's the last one.

497
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:28,574
Rym: He is a pretty cool guy.

498
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,282
Rym: I've seen him do a bunch of talks effects They have.

499
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,996
Rym: he is really funny in person.

500
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:42,800
Rym: Yeah Also, it sounds like his daughter's really cute mmm I guess good stories about trying to write and but anyway Those videos are probably on YouTube because those weren't like secret pegs dev talks.

501
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,342
Rym: They were just fun.

502
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:46,620
Rym: pegs dev talks go look for Patrick Rothfuss like pecs talks.

503
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:47,699
Rym: You might find something on YouTube.

504
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:56,978
Rym: Anyway, so I was thinking about this because I I've read this article a little while ago about how rich kids are cheating in school with Apple watches.

505
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:06,460
Scott: Major League Baseball people are cheating with Apple watches till they got caught and yeah They can't have Apple watches in the dugout anymore, but what's interesting is that poor kids?

506
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,574
Rym: It's not just that they like poor kids Probably like everyone with a lot of people know a cross-section of society would cheat if they could.

507
00:35:14,256 --> 00:35:18,769
Rym: it's not just That rich kids can afford eye watches and poor kids can't.

508
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:25,960
Rym: it's that the kinds of rules that schools enforce Tend to be highly weighted towards socioeconomic status.

509
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:30,900
Rym: So they won't make the kids in a rich school take off their eye watches.

510
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:33,688
Rym: Yeah The rich school doesn't have a no Apple watch rule.

511
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:41,040
Rym: so the poor kids in the rich school don't have the eye watch and they just Get worse grades on average because the same percentage of them want to cheat.

512
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:44,520
Rym: But only the rich kids have the opportunity to cheat.

513
00:35:45,342 --> 00:35:50,760
Rym: And simultaneously the poor schools will often enforce rules like can't have a goddamn cell phone in school.

514
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,326
Rym: Sorry kids no laptops.

515
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:53,450
Scott: and the New York schools.

516
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,060
Scott: They have a thing where I get I've seen these things.

517
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,087
Scott: It's like a little van.

518
00:35:57,269 --> 00:35:58,820
Scott: It's like it's actually a private company.

519
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:06,320
Scott: There is and it'll sit outside the public school and kids on their way into school will go over to this van.

520
00:36:06,744 --> 00:36:08,380
Scott: That is a privately owned business.

521
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:10,206
Scott: Give them money and their phone.

522
00:36:10,226 --> 00:36:14,240
Scott: that that van will hold on to the and it's like it's like a coat check for phones.

523
00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:19,315
Scott: And then when the kid comes out of school They bring their ticket and get their phone back because they're not allowed to have the phone in school now.

524
00:36:19,496 --> 00:36:19,636
Rym: one.

525
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:20,400
Scott: that's bullshit.

526
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,604
Scott: I don't know if the rule has changed But I've these.

527
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:24,673
Scott: they were definitely a thing that existed.

528
00:36:24,754 --> 00:36:28,046
Scott: if it doesn't still exist those Rules tend to own like.

529
00:36:28,547 --> 00:36:35,831
Rym: where those rules exist or are enforced is highly dependent upon Socio-economic status of the area and the students.

530
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:44,140
Rym: Yep, and to make it even worse Access to technology is often an issue for kids with disabilities where some kids need some technology.

531
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:49,360
Rym: But only rich kids can get the doctor's note that says why they need the technology.

532
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:55,160
Rym: So poor kids who need the same technology, even if they have the technology can't actually get everything together.

533
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,448
Rym: So the school will let them use the technology.

534
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:57,869
Rym: Yep.

535
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,976
Rym: So this is like a this space.

536
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,240
Rym: people don't talk about it a lot.

537
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,731
Rym: There's a lot going on in the like.

538
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:05,720
Rym: how kids use technology in school.

539
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,049
Scott: Balancing games only balancing school.

540
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,475
Scott: Yes replace game with school.

541
00:37:12,515 --> 00:37:13,097
Scott: Nothing changes.

542
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:19,160
Rym: So Did you ever cheat with technology when you were in school in the era of TI calculators?

543
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:26,380
Scott: The only cheating I did is because I was angry that they were like you may not have programs on your calculator.

544
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:28,270
Rym: Oh, I was so funny.

545
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,336
Scott: Can you think they were like you?

546
00:37:29,356 --> 00:37:30,180
Scott: can you first of all?

547
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,215
Scott: I was mad when they said no calculator at all.

548
00:37:32,255 --> 00:37:32,860
Scott: That was bullshit.

549
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:38,720
Rym: So one only the only the normal kid classes had that rule the so-called accelerated classes.

550
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:40,454
Rym: You gotta have a calculator.

551
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:41,180
Rym: You can't be in the class.

552
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:41,683
Scott: Well, no there were.

553
00:37:41,904 --> 00:37:42,467
Scott: I mean there.

554
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:44,760
Scott: I was like in a class where the calculator was required.

555
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:50,580
Scott: But for certain parts of the curriculum, it was like alright these tests no calculator and it was bullshit.

556
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,608
Scott: Anyway, I was like that's bullshit in my whole life.

557
00:37:52,668 --> 00:37:54,154
Scott: I'm gonna have a calculator and a computer.

558
00:37:54,335 --> 00:37:55,580
Scott: Yeah, why would I you know?

559
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:03,788
Scott: but anyway But when they did allow a calculator the teacher would be like, hey we're not gonna allow you to have any programs on your calculator.

560
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:09,205
Rym: because well programs usually men you someone had typed a bunch of Stuff into a text editor.

561
00:38:09,506 --> 00:38:10,910
Scott: Well, no, but we had a whole.

562
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:11,272
Scott: I had.

563
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:14,562
Scott: we had Kate you had we had serial cables and all sorts Sophisticated.

564
00:38:14,582 --> 00:38:15,305
Rym: Oh, yeah, so we passed.

565
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:16,629
Rym: get like that pong game around.

566
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,640
Scott: Oh, ti colic org was like my most visited website.

567
00:38:19,761 --> 00:38:21,440
Scott: I still have all my stuff in my drawer at home.

568
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:24,454
Rym: I didn't have the cable to get the stuff onto my calculator directly.

569
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:25,640
Rym: So I had a copy from other people.

570
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:29,800
Scott: That's because the calculator came with the calculator to calculator cable.

571
00:38:30,282 --> 00:38:33,896
Scott: I had these cereal and also I now have a USB to calculator cable.

572
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:58,959
Scott: But anyway We would use these to get software from ti colic org some of it written in basics I'm written in assembly loaded onto the calculator, but me and my friend together mostly my friend, but also not completely not me We wrote programs that would do things like factored polynomials Allow you to pass a test on factoring polynomials really easily.

573
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:10,623
Scott: Like if it was saying like if it was like ax plus ax squared plus BX plus C. Yeah, we had a program that we made where you just literally typed in a B and C and pressed enter, you know It's funny.

574
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:20,746
Rym: I wrote one for Calculus class because remember this was before even like the ti-89 were like no kids had like Fancier calculators that did more.

575
00:39:21,047 --> 00:39:21,588
Rym: Yeah.

576
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:22,411
Scott: Well, we had.

577
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:25,885
Scott: most kids had ti-83 because that was required by school Had ti-86.

578
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:29,360
Rym: So ti-86 came out later.

579
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,801
Rym: We had so in our school normal kids had to have the ti-83 and the school would buy it for you if you couldn't afford It.

580
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:38,657
Rym: but if you're in the accelerated program, you had to get a ti-85.

581
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:41,790
Rym: See the 86 was too new.

582
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:45,026
Scott: It wasn't I was out but Like there was this.

583
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:46,975
Scott: basically the school just wanted everyone to have 83, right?

584
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,253
Scott: But it's like smart kids didn't buy 83 because they knew better.

585
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:52,960
Rym: the 85 was better in every possible way.

586
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,968
Rym: 86 had way more memory.

587
00:39:55,048 --> 00:39:59,970
Scott: I saw nerds with 85s, but then when I went to the store I saw an 86 which is just an upgraded.

588
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:00,814
Scott: 85 is two.

589
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:01,980
Rym: more of the next is better.

590
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,812
Scott: And then there was the 89 that came later.

591
00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:06,560
Rym: So in high school, there's one kid.

592
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:11,039
Rym: He was kind of rich and smarmy and then I got a bunch of stars not worth telling on this show.

593
00:40:11,682 --> 00:40:13,429
Rym: Kid had a fucking ti-90.

594
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,320
Rym: Well, I saw kid which was older than the 86.

595
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,471
Scott: Well, there's like the 92 right just a big one.

596
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:20,120
Scott: The 90 was like the big one.

597
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,247
Scott: The 92 was the Upgraded 90.

598
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:29,692
Rym: I forget the difference But basically he had this thing and it would do some calculus.

599
00:40:29,872 --> 00:40:31,577
Scott: and like 89 basically did this stuff.

600
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:37,060
Rym: the 90 did almost Yeah, but it would do like symbolic math which they five and 86 could not do by themselves.

601
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,300
Scott: There's a huge scam going on because those things still cost a fortune which is ridiculous.

602
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:43,432
Rym: But you can get an app on a phone that does it for free.

603
00:40:43,592 --> 00:40:44,920
Scott: Yeah, it's like why?

604
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,835
Scott: But there's no reason for those z80 processors to cost that much money.

605
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:49,679
Scott: They should be like five hours.

606
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,420
Rym: So what's funny is I did the same thing.

607
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,804
Rym: I wrote some programs.

608
00:40:53,024 --> 00:41:00,690
Rym: what based on the types of problems people would commonly get in like trig and Calc classes that would Do like symbolic math.

609
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:05,690
Rym: as long as the problem with it was in certain parameters It would do the math and it would even show the work.

610
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:08,380
Rym: so it would print out like here's the work to show.

611
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:09,671
Rym: here is the answer.

612
00:41:09,691 --> 00:41:14,300
Rym: and I Got a talking to by the school.

613
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:18,000
Rym: But they couldn't actually punish me because it wasn't against the rules to write the write the program.

614
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:20,960
Rym: It was only against the rules for some other kid to use the program.

615
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:23,480
Rym: And of course my name was all over the fucking program.

616
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,460
Rym: It's like you could just have made this right y'all right at the start of the test.

617
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,990
Scott: Even if you had a blank calculator, you could start typing in the program.

618
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:32,280
Scott: Yep, right if you memorized it, but anyway.

619
00:41:33,081 --> 00:41:40,140
Scott: So what we did is we had the program we wrote But they wanted us to like erase our calculators before the test.

620
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:40,622
Rym: We did that.

621
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:44,120
Rym: my school did that to get around the fact that I had distributed this program so widely.

622
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:53,000
Scott: So we there was another program we got from the internet that would basically Display on your calculator screen the message that said this calculator had just been reset.

623
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:59,100
Scott: Oh, yeah, it was light up those pixels the same pixels that would be lit up if you legit reset your calculator.

624
00:41:59,382 --> 00:42:00,488
Scott: You'd show that to the teacher.

625
00:42:00,528 --> 00:42:01,171
Scott: They'd say okay.

626
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,740
Scott: I believe you reset your calculator.

627
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:06,620
Rym: So the one we downloaded that we all shared was a little bit better than that.

628
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:16,646
Rym: You basically would hit a button when you wanted it to activate and it would go through Emotions like it was erasing and even show a progress bar Because there was that little like single pixel.

629
00:42:16,726 --> 00:42:20,859
Scott: ours did the same thing the calculator did when you legit reset it not some fake.

630
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:21,375
Rym: Oh, no.

631
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,584
Rym: so when you did the reset there was this one pixel progress bar for like a second or two and then it would be like Erased.

632
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:28,937
Rym: it even emulated that.

633
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:30,946
Rym: That was the important part.

634
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:40,860
Scott: So I would let a teacher believe you reset the calculator You'd make that go away and then your calculator was not reset and you would have your program Yep, and then you would take you take the test finish it really fast then play Tetris.

635
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:51,700
Rym: So I even went one step further because I wrote another program that I used myself That would show like physics equations in detail and all this stuff, but I put copy protection in it.

636
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,800
Rym: So if anyone else messed with the code like remove my name from it or anything.

637
00:42:56,142 --> 00:43:02,839
Rym: It looked like it still worked but it gave slightly wrong answers And some kids got busted around that.

638
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:07,700
Rym: But I used the hell out of these programs and I totally got away with it.

639
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:15,308
Rym: And actually my school ended up giving up on enforcing and they like basically because of the programs I wrote the school sort of changed his policy to.

640
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:27,348
Rym: you can use whatever programs are on the calculator and the test should just reflect a mastery of skills as opposed to just like knowing equations or like they Do in these days with their Apple watches.

641
00:43:29,883 --> 00:43:37,916
Rym: So as best I can tell kids just like look things up on Wikipedia Like we've could say here's the thing in the old days you on Apple watch.

642
00:43:38,056 --> 00:43:44,760
Rym: in the old days We could only use programs like this to quote-unquote cheat in math class.

643
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,670
Rym: Maybe physics class maybe certain science classes.

644
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:55,236
Rym: because I remember I was sitting in French class in 10th grade and this one kid Sean busted out his ti-85 and started like typing something.

645
00:43:55,497 --> 00:43:59,170
Rym: and the teachers like What math are you doing in the French test?

646
00:43:59,812 --> 00:44:01,699
Rym: bring your calculator up here right now?

647
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,479
Rym: And He'd legit like typed a French dictionary into a program.

648
00:44:08,307 --> 00:44:12,530
Scott: He just like typed a bunch of shit The words that from that we learned in that section of the.

649
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:14,416
Rym: so he typed like the parts that were relevant.

650
00:44:14,436 --> 00:44:17,005
Rym: like he basically he didn't Really understand the calculator.

651
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:20,540
Rym: so he wrote a program, but the program was not a program you could run.

652
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,949
Rym: He just typed a bunch of shed that he needed to remember.

653
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,640
Scott: so we could take the program editor basically using it as a text.

654
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:28,906
Rym: Yep Yeah, he got busted instantly.

655
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:34,440
Rym: so like I couldn't use the calculator unless I had a plausible reason to use the calculator.

656
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,593
Scott: Yeah, and it's not like I had a phone with a computer in it in 1990.

657
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:46,360
Rym: Whatever I mean in 1997 I had a cell phone that I brought to high school with me, and you could not install software on it.

658
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,579
Scott: It could make phone calls.

659
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:50,152
Rym: It did not have a screen of any kind.

660
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:58,579
Scott: the Motorola star tech I had Could display web pages in sort of a worse than links web browser at great expense to the phone plan.

661
00:44:58,599 --> 00:44:59,949
Scott: that phone I did not have till 2001. yep.

662
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,525
Rym: So kids see.

663
00:45:03,565 --> 00:45:10,032
Rym: it's interesting because kids can't really cheat with their phones Because it's really obvious if a kid pulls out a phone like.

664
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:15,391
Rym: that's an easy rule that a non Technologically savvy person can apply to a classroom of.

665
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,760
Rym: you can't pull your phone out of your pocket during the test.

666
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:22,980
Rym: Yep a Savvy kid could make something with vibration nonsense like chess masters.

667
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,207
Rym: No one's doing that in high school.

668
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:26,380
Rym: if you are I feel like you deserve it.

669
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:27,505
Rym: Yeah, like you won.

670
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:28,249
Rym: Good job.

671
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:30,439
Rym: You have a skill that you can apply to real life.

672
00:45:31,384 --> 00:45:34,620
Rym: But the I watch I think presents a specific problem.

673
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:43,793
Rym: I don't think a lot of teachers understand the capabilities of smartwatches and It's really easy to kind of slyly look at a watch.

674
00:45:43,813 --> 00:45:46,225
Scott: you got a multiple-choice test You can easily use.

675
00:45:46,305 --> 00:45:47,973
Scott: Apple watch is just text with a friend.

676
00:45:47,993 --> 00:45:51,866
Scott: the minimum cheating I would do is like we're not even gonna cheat I'm just gonna.

677
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:53,294
Scott: I'll do all the even questions.

678
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:54,180
Scott: Rym do all the odd ones.

679
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:54,963
Scott: It's a little choice.

680
00:45:55,064 --> 00:45:56,148
Scott: I messaged you 1a.

681
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:57,615
Scott: you messaged me to be.

682
00:45:57,695 --> 00:45:58,278
Scott: I messaged you 3c.

683
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:05,326
Scott: yeah, we get the test done in half the time and I trust Rym to do his half and he cuz he has to trust me To do my half.

684
00:46:05,648 --> 00:46:06,999
Scott: Yeah, he's better do a good job.

685
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:13,640
Rym: Or you get someone who took the test earlier in the day and they start texting you answers from their tests that they already took.

686
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:14,963
Rym: Mm-hmm, they're like.

687
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:16,929
Rym: it's real easy to get away with.

688
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:21,265
Rym: and I feel like because it's a watch a lot of teachers Don't like.

689
00:46:21,286 --> 00:46:24,247
Rym: they don't understand enough to be like, all right Everyone has to take their watches off during the test.

690
00:46:24,468 --> 00:46:30,560
Rym: Yep, and coupled with everything else we talked about It seems like this is pretty rampant cheating now.

691
00:46:31,142 --> 00:46:43,480
Rym: And I guess what I find philosophically different about this is that with older shittier technology The act of trying to cheat taught you as much as the cheating like it taught you as much as the class.

692
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:43,964
Scott: Yeah, it was.

693
00:46:44,226 --> 00:46:45,659
Scott: I had to write a program.

694
00:46:45,941 --> 00:46:54,720
Scott: Yeah to make my program that did some like simple symbolic I had to at least download and install a program onto it, which is like oh anyone can do that onto a TI calculator.

695
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:57,579
Rym: Yeah with what looks like a headphone cable like.

696
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:04,780
Rym: But I like I had to learn symbolic math enough to write a program in basically Q basic.

697
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:07,670
Rym: That could do it on my calculator.

698
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:12,406
Scott: type it all in my hand type it on a calculator Yep, not on a computer.

699
00:47:12,807 --> 00:47:16,700
Rym: and I had to figure out how to hide the fact that this program existed from my teacher.

700
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:19,546
Rym: So I learned more doing that.

701
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:30,960
Rym: but nowadays with the watch situation like real easy to cheat Hard for teachers to deal with and I worry that it like I don't know what schools should do about this situation.

702
00:47:31,422 --> 00:47:33,411
Scott: I know exactly what schools should do about the situation.

703
00:47:33,531 --> 00:47:39,780
Scott: All right, you need to make tests Such that the test itself is invulnerable to cheating.

704
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:49,551
Rym: Yes, the idea that I would argue that in the modern world most tests in school You should have a computer with access to the full internet during the test.

705
00:47:49,712 --> 00:47:57,220
Rym: Yep, and the test should be such that Just reading wiki if you go to Wikipedia learn the thing to answer the question.

706
00:47:58,123 --> 00:48:03,340
Rym: That was the test you were able to get a correct answer while using the internet like that is.

707
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:06,860
Scott: I mean not just that but it's like just the kind of questions you got to ask.

708
00:48:07,442 --> 00:48:10,132
Scott: Be things where it's like, okay.

709
00:48:10,392 --> 00:48:11,055
Scott: Yeah, good luck.

710
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:11,798
Scott: You got the internet.

711
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:12,440
Scott: You're still not.

712
00:48:12,661 --> 00:48:14,085
Scott: Let's see if you even with the internet.

713
00:48:14,105 --> 00:48:14,908
Scott: Can you do this?

714
00:48:15,088 --> 00:48:15,429
Rym: Yep.

715
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:16,593
Scott: Can you huh?

716
00:48:16,713 --> 00:48:17,074
Scott: Can you?

717
00:48:17,134 --> 00:48:18,900
Scott: it's not just like what was what?

718
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,006
Scott: Year, it's like, okay.

719
00:48:20,026 --> 00:48:20,490
Scott: I looked it up.

720
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,034
Scott: I typed it in.

721
00:48:21,055 --> 00:48:21,720
Scott: I get correct.

722
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,202
Scott: It's like no.

723
00:48:22,222 --> 00:48:23,547
Scott: no, you can't ask a question like that.

724
00:48:23,687 --> 00:48:23,908
Scott: Yep.

725
00:48:23,948 --> 00:48:30,511
Scott: The question has to be like, alright, here is a here's a Complicated right word math problem, right?

726
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:30,892
Scott: Okay.

727
00:48:30,952 --> 00:48:31,815
Scott: I got the whole internet.

728
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:33,160
Scott: Do you even know what math you need to do?

729
00:48:33,621 --> 00:48:34,906
Rym: Yep, do you even?

730
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:36,511
Scott: can you even figure out what it's like?

731
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:38,980
Scott: Okay, you have the gods calculator.

732
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,117
Scott: Do you even know what to type into it?

733
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:48,770
Rym: And thus we need to also for the situations where it does make sense to deny technology We need pretty universe like standardized testing.

734
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:57,939
Rym: You need pretty standard like universally applicable ways to enforce that regardless of socio-economic status or act or act.

735
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,620
Scott: Access to said technology like a test where it's like, alright, we're asking you this question about the book.

736
00:49:04,062 --> 00:49:05,308
Scott: You got a whole copy of the book.

737
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,459
Scott: Yep, and you hear kids a cliff notes, too.

738
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,160
Scott: Let's see you answer the this, you know quite complicated question.

739
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:13,773
Scott: So, you know the feelings of the characters in the book.

740
00:49:13,793 --> 00:49:15,160
Scott: you're gonna read the whole book while you sit here.

741
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:16,767
Scott: We got a time constraint 10 minutes.

742
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,109
Scott: Let's go.

743
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:19,580
Rym: So I remember one time this was in 10th grader at the book.

744
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,753
Scott: It would be easy would take one minute.

745
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:28,293
Rym: in 10th grade I was an AP Western sieve and a lot of people in the class despite it being an AP class were I think the technical definition of this person is chuckle fuck.

746
00:49:29,038 --> 00:49:34,194
Rym: so they they were like They were shitty at this class and there was trouble.

747
00:49:34,295 --> 00:49:37,972
Rym: and the teacher was like, you know What everyone had trouble with the last test the test tomorrow.

748
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:38,756
Rym: God.

749
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:39,198
Rym: Guess what?

750
00:49:39,278 --> 00:49:39,620
Rym: open book?

751
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:42,190
Rym: I'll let you use the book not changing the test at all.

752
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:42,712
Rym: open book.

753
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:47,975
Rym: Mm-hmm and Basically all the people who had been struggling struggled just as much.

754
00:49:48,036 --> 00:49:48,980
Rym: they are still all failed.

755
00:49:49,273 --> 00:49:51,306
Rym: Yeah the same way and he proved his point.

756
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:59,478
Scott: and there's also lots of other anti cheating techniques that teachers have used for a long time like Multiple-choice give everyone the same multiple-choice questions, but randomize the order.

757
00:49:59,498 --> 00:49:59,558
Scott: Yep.

758
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:06,450
Scott: So when people are like looking at the other person's scan Tron, let's say go 5c It's like but there five was your ten.

759
00:50:07,112 --> 00:50:07,854
Scott: You didn't know.

760
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:07,934
Rym: Yep.

761
00:50:08,877 --> 00:50:09,580
Scott: Everyone was random.

762
00:50:10,222 --> 00:50:13,113
Rym: I think like it's pretty easy to prevent this kind of cheating.

763
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:22,673
Rym: You just need teachers who care and reasonably uniform ideas of how to approach it and it shouldn't involve such draconian things as Dropping your technology off at the door when you come in.

764
00:50:22,693 --> 00:50:24,260
Rym: Yep, but we need somewhere.

765
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:30,820
Scott: These days are taking a lot of tests like on their computer or there's like, you know, they're going to some website.

766
00:50:30,922 --> 00:50:37,280
Scott: They had to take the website, you know It's like yeah, they're doing a study from home like college course and all the tests are on the computer.

767
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,600
Scott: They got to do it at home and it's like as soon as they start tests like this timer happens.

768
00:50:40,982 --> 00:50:42,147
Scott: It's like just hack that shit.

769
00:50:42,508 --> 00:50:45,280
Scott: Yeah, it's like you can't lose some JavaScript.

770
00:50:50,102 --> 00:50:58,239
Rym: The other side of this then I think we'll be out of time so we can wrap it up is the Cheating via like the heuristic detection of plagiarizing in tests.

771
00:50:58,601 --> 00:51:04,121
Scott: Oh plagiarizing is totally like, you know, the other kinds of cheating are much more cool within like plagiarizing Especially.

772
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:04,503
Scott: that's like.

773
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:06,069
Scott: that's like we're not cuz we're not you.

774
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:07,053
Scott: those are you?

775
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:15,960
Scott: plagiarism usually comes into play Not on a test you take in a room But when you have a project yup, like make a program that does this or write an essay about this.

776
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,913
Scott: You can't cheat on that because you go home and work on it.

777
00:51:19,054 --> 00:51:20,400
Scott: It's like you have the full internet.

778
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,910
Scott: You can talk to people you can you can.

779
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,200
Scott: basically you can stack overflow and ask for help.

780
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,143
Scott: It's like you can.

781
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:33,069
Scott: the whole resources of the world are available to you when it's a take-home project paper Thing.

782
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,300
Rym: so I have an anecdote.

783
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:40,168
Scott: Problem is plagiarism where you literally just you know You take someone else's and turn it in.

784
00:51:40,569 --> 00:51:41,794
Scott: so and that is not cool.

785
00:51:41,955 --> 00:51:42,095
Scott: when

786
00:51:42,176 --> 00:51:58,279
Rym: I was in elementary school I remember this moment so clearly because another bullshit thing happened that day This is in third grade where a kid used the word expel as As like part of a little essay they wrote and the teacher was like there's no way you know that word and failed him that I was really mad because that kid was smart.

787
00:51:58,863 --> 00:52:02,040
Rym: But in the same day we had all had to write an essay on Mahatma Gandhi.

788
00:52:02,801 --> 00:52:07,566
Rym: Everyone had to write an essay the whole week on Mahatma Gandhi and then on Monday Everyone's gonna read their essay out loud.

789
00:52:08,047 --> 00:52:10,677
Rym: So we just went down the road and the first kid read their essay.

790
00:52:10,978 --> 00:52:16,679
Rym: Mm-hmm the second kid read their essay and it was very similar.

791
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:21,331
Rym: Like Very similar the first couple of sentences were different.

792
00:52:21,653 --> 00:52:25,948
Rym: the last couple of sentences were different But the middle sounded like exactly the same.

793
00:52:25,968 --> 00:52:28,697
Rym: Mm-hmm teacher didn't seem to notice anything like teacher didn't.

794
00:52:28,717 --> 00:52:29,459
Rym: just don't faced it.

795
00:52:30,404 --> 00:52:36,010
Rym: the third person starts reading the rest say and it's pretty much the same essay and They stumble over a word and some other.

796
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:42,975
Rym: a kid in the class provided the next word Looking at their own essay and the teacher was like everyone pass your essays forward.

797
00:52:43,256 --> 00:52:48,830
Rym: Most of you are probably failing Mm-hmm, and then the next day the class got a lesson in.

798
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:53,220
Rym: why not to just copy the encyclopedia article on Mahatma Gandhi?

799
00:52:54,801 --> 00:53:02,293
Rym: They had physically copied it by hand from the same encyclopedia because everyone had the same encyclopedia Except you except a couple of people.

800
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:03,440
Rym: No, I just actually wrote an essay.

801
00:53:04,204 --> 00:53:07,000
Rym: I read the way I've read that encyclopedia and I wrote my own essay.

802
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:09,630
Rym: That mostly said that but I use different words.

803
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:12,180
Scott: I would have just watched Gandhi the movie and then written an essay.

804
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:13,838
Scott: Easier that way.

805
00:53:22,347 --> 00:53:24,870
