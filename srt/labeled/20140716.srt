1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,568
Rym: It's Wednesday, July 16th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:10,909
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:14,179
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,744
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:20,400
Rym: Tonight, Sailor Moon Crystal reviewing it after one episode.

6
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:22,619
Scott: That's all you need really.

7
00:00:24,402 --> 00:00:25,398
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,400
Rym: So yeah, we're back in bed from ConnectiCon 2014, which from my perspective was the most well run, well oiled machine I've ever seen that convention be.

9
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:38,760
Scott: Yeah, okay.

10
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:40,240
Rym: It was actually pretty amazing.

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,869
Scott: I don't know why not everyone went.

12
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:44,043
Scott: There's got to be someone listening to this who wasn't there.

13
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:45,880
Scott: Why didn't they go?

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,738
Rym: Well, you know, if you live in Seattle- Probably not worth it.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,834
Rym: Yeah, I would not fly to Connecticut, but if I lived in, say, New York City, I would go.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,208
Rym: Yeah.

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,067
Rym: If I lived in, say,

18
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:56,653
Rym: D.C.,

19
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:57,239
Rym: I would go.

20
00:00:57,864 --> 00:00:58,096
Rym: Maybe.

21
00:00:58,581 --> 00:00:58,844
Rym: I would go.

22
00:00:58,865 --> 00:00:59,595
Rym: What else are you going to do?

23
00:00:59,615 --> 00:00:59,980
Rym: Go to ConnectiCon?

24
00:01:03,342 --> 00:01:22,540
Rym: But yeah, ConnectiCon was amazing, so I just do want to put a big shout out to all the people who came to our panels, and a lot of you might have ... I noticed a huge uptick in YouTube viewership of a whole bunch of our videos, literally like Sunday of the con, and I'm wondering if that flyer I put out that had the QR code to our YouTube channel worked.

25
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:23,180
Rym: Maybe.

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,700
Rym: I wonder if people were watching YouTube videos on the way home on their phones, because- Well, check your YouTube stats.

27
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:33,220
Scott: Yeah, what I was about to say is I looked- If it says direct visitor, then that means someone who typed the URL in or used the QR.

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,100
Rym: I looked, and it seems to be mostly cell phones and tablets was the increase.

29
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:38,756
Scott: There you go.

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,168
Rym: Yeah.

31
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,020
Rym: So if you guys actually listen to the podcast, I'll be way more impressed.

32
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:46,380
Rym: But yeah.

33
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:49,737
Scott: Why don't we make a trailer for our channel that's like,

34
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:49,999
Scott: "Hey.".

35
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:51,348
Rym: I've been thinking about doing that.

36
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:52,415
Rym: You know why I haven't done that?

37
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:56,848
Rym: Because I've got a queue of five hour long videos I've got to edit together.

38
00:01:56,948 --> 00:02:02,977
Rym: Never mind episode 13 of it.

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,244
Rym: Some weekend that isn't Netrunner.

40
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:07,093
Rym: Yeah.

41
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:08,157
Rym: So we're back.

42
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:12,240
Rym: We didn't do a show on Monday, because I kind of sounded like this, and I was tired.

43
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:13,159
Scott: And we didn't have a topic.

44
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:14,851
Scott: Monday topic.

45
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:15,519
Scott: Send them in, people.

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,505
Rym: Now I got a topic.

47
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:19,300
Rym: Let's talk about GUI frameworks.

48
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:21,960
Scott: Oh, like WX widgets?

49
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,327
Rym: Or like- GTK?

50
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:24,347
Rym: QT?

51
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:26,471
Scott: AWT?

52
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:27,320
Scott: Swing?

53
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,608
Rym: Fuck AWT.

54
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:29,840
Rym: Fuck Swing.

55
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:36,944
Rym: Yeah, I got a bunch of products I deal with that have old Swing GUI, like JNLP client, Swing GUI kind of stuff.

56
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:42,100
Rym: Pretty sure that's getting dropped or at least ignored by Oracle, and probably is a dead end.

57
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,980
Scott: I haven't used any of those since college.

58
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,561
Rym: Yeah.

59
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,008
Rym: But I got some other stuff.

60
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:50,319
Rym: that's on an old version of XTJS, and lo and behold, the new version actually looks pretty slick.

61
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,550
Scott: You know why I stopped using all GUI thingies?

62
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,480
Scott: Because it's just easier to make web pages.

63
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:58,118
Scott: Why make a GUI when you can just make some HTML and CSS?

64
00:02:58,754 --> 00:02:58,899
Scott: Yep.

65
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,799
Scott: It's just easier.

66
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,220
Rym: Maybe use a web framework where it's all JavaScript creating web pages.

67
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,449
Scott: That's fine.

68
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,040
Scott: It doesn't matter.

69
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:05,739
Rym: That's okay.

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:18,640
Scott: The point is it's easier to make web pages that just post and interact with APIs than it is to make a GUI with multiple callbacks for every single interactive piece, every menu and every button and every everything.

71
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,100
Rym: If everything we just said sounds like wizardry, you should listen to GeekNights Mondays, not just GeekNights Wednesdays.

72
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,140
Scott: Or completely avoid GeekNights Mondays because it sounds like that.

73
00:03:28,022 --> 00:03:35,240
Rym: If you speak the secret language, capitalized, then you should probably listen to GeekNights Tuesdays.

74
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,900
Rym: So yeah, Sailor Moon, the old Sailor Moon is ongoing.

75
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,459
Rym: As you recall, we did an episode remembering Sailor Moon.

76
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,851
Scott: Three weeks ago, a month ago?

77
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,817
Rym: We did that on exactly May 21st.

78
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:50,599
Scott: Oh, so already a couple months ago.

79
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:50,940
Rym: Yeah.

80
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:51,562
Rym: So you know what?

81
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:59,231
Rym: I'm actually starting to ... I skipped a bunch of episodes of the beginning episodes and then deked up so many times.

82
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:01,020
Rym: and I just don't care.

83
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,496
Rym: We're just at the point where I care because Jedi's dead.

84
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:05,039
Rym: Spoilers.

85
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:09,900
Scott: Pretty much anyone whose name ends in -ite is going to die.

86
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:12,238
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

87
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,700
Scott: That's pretty much a foregone conclusion.

88
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:16,779
Scott: It's not a spoiler.

89
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,100
Rym: Because Jedi was such a punk.

90
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:27,240
Rym: At least of all those guys, Malachite/Kunzite, depending on how weeaboo you were, is probably the most competent.

91
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:29,518
Rym: Zoicite's probably the most evil.

92
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,380
Rym: Nephrite's probably the most almost cool.

93
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,939
Rym: And Jedi just sucks.

94
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:38,639
Scott: Jedi's Glass Joe.

95
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:40,959
Scott: He's the Glass Joe of Sailor Moon, bad guys.

96
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,659
Rym: I mean, he dodged Mun tierra action what once.

97
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:45,140
Rym: That was his moment.

98
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,199
Rym: Really never made it up beyond that.

99
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,279
Rym: Though I always got the impression that in the manga there was a little more going on between him and that monster that he used.

100
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:56,940
Scott: Well, the monster was way into him, right?

101
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:58,419
Rym: Yeah, they had a relationship going.

102
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:02,320
Scott: He wasn't into it, but he took advantage and used her.

103
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,760
Rym: Simultaneously, why does Queen Beryl care so much about that one monster?

104
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:07,903
Scott: I don't know.

105
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:08,728
Scott: Was it a monster?

106
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:10,157
Scott: Maybe it was her monster.

107
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:10,520
Scott: I don't know.

108
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,583
Rym: They're all her monsters?

109
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:17,540
Rym: Well, can't spoil anything for you, but we're not even close to resolving any of that.

110
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:20,550
Scott: There's nothing to spoil.

111
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,760
Scott: There's bad guys and good guys.

112
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,800
Scott: Okay, it's like trying to spoil Mazinger.

113
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,612
Scott: It's like, have I seen Mazinger Z?

114
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:26,640
Scott: Maybe like two episodes.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,743
Scott: What can you spoil?

116
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:31,277
Scott: Mazinger rocket punches the fuck out of every bad robot ever.

117
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:31,920
Scott: The end.

118
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,940
Scott: Maybe he's in trouble once, or twice, and maybe he gets beat up a bunch, but you know what?

119
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,878
Scott: He comes back and gets replaced and rocket punches the fuck out of all the bad guys.

120
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:42,159
Scott: The end.

121
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,700
Rym: I guess the thing I can really say, though, and I think I cannot stress this enough, actually.

122
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:57,780
Rym: I was thinking about skipping most of the first season just because I've seen this shit a million times, but in the old days, when I'd watch Sailor Moon, I just marathoned 30, 40 episodes in a row.

123
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:04,060
Rym: Maybe split up over two days and a weekend with a bunch of people, and it got real old.

124
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,140
Rym: In the middle of Sailor Moon Supers, or Super S, there's a monster of the week.

125
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,287
Rym: Here's the Pegasus.

126
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:12,215
Rym: Clarion call.

127
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:12,619
Rym: The end.

128
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:19,760
Rym: That repetitive monster of the week is not nearly so bad if you actually watch the show one episode a week.

129
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:21,878
Scott: Two episodes a week, but yeah, pretty much.

130
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,400
Rym: Because suddenly now, I'm watching every transformation sequence and marveling at that animation.

131
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,419
Scott: Unlike other shows where the stock footage is like this crappy, repeated footage.

132
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,646
Scott: It's like, oh, here we go again.

133
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:39,126
Scott: It's like, wow, they really did a good job on that repeated stock footage because they had to use it so many times.

134
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:43,040
Scott: They put a lot of effort into it, and it's fun to watch and has good music.

135
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,000
Rym: I did read that the budget for the opening to season one of Sailor Moon cost more to animate than an episode.

136
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,020
Scott: Pretty typical.

137
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:50,681
Rym: Yup.

138
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:52,854
Rym: But we're not talking about old Sailor Moon tonight.

139
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:53,940
Rym: We're talking about new Sailor Moon.

140
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,940
Rym: So before we get to that, it's news.

141
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:56,891
Scott: News.

142
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,379
Rym: We have at least one new listener out there.

143
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,159
Scott: Yeah, so here's a pretty normal-ish news, but at least it's exciting for me.

144
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,933
Scott: Yo-yo pedal, bicycle anime, gonna get a movie.

145
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:09,440
Scott: Why is this exciting?

146
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,905
Scott: Not because the movie's gonna be good.

147
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:16,468
Scott: It's probably just gonna be a slightly more well-animated recap of season one if I know how these things go.

148
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,293
Scott: And I do.

149
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:17,414
Scott: Right?

150
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:30,180
Scott: But it's exciting because it indicates that Yo-Yo Pedal is gonna be one of these long-running type animes that's got a movie every year and TV episodes that never end.

151
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,000
Rym: So it's gotten a step beyond Initial D's peak.

152
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:33,721
Scott: Right.

153
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:39,100
Scott: So usually, when you have shows like that, there's shows I don't wanna watch, like Naruto.

154
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,940
Scott: Or One Piece, which I would watch if it wasn't so even slower than Yo-Yo Pedal.

155
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:49,233
Scott: But Yo-Yo Pedal's about bicycling, and it's gonna keep going.

156
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:49,876
Scott: So, hooray.

157
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:52,205
Scott: But you know what's bullshit?

158
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:55,257
Scott: Season one ends on a cliffhanger, which is not unheard of.

159
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:55,880
Scott: That's fine.

160
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,159
Scott: But did it end right before the finish line of a race?

161
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,951
Rym: Yeah, Initial D never tried to pull anything like that.

162
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,920
Rym: Initial D would end an episode in the middle of the race.

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,080
Rym: It would not end a season.

164
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:09,603
Scott: Right.

165
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:12,820
Scott: It didn't end the season right before the finish line of the race.

166
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:18,960
Scott: They ended the season slightly before the finish line of the second day of a three-day race.

167
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,905
Scott: Oh my god, horseshit.

168
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:30,414
Scott: That means that the next season in October is gonna start with the end of that second day, and then they're gonna start off with the third day of that race.

169
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:31,620
Scott: It's like, are you kidding me?

170
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:38,059
Scott: There are other more suspenseful cliffhangers in other shows, say Escaflowne.

171
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,120
Rym: Escaflowne, I think, might actually win the prize for the worst cliffhanger in all of anime ever.

172
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,667
Scott: You think it still might be the king?

173
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:46,189
Scott: It's up there.

174
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,435
Scott: It's tied, at least.

175
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:55,700
Rym: Imagine if that episode of Escaflowne was the Attack on Titan situation.

176
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:59,799
Scott: Right, but that's ridiculously suspenseful.

177
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:06,480
Scott: But imagine if it just cuts off when it's not super suspenseful, it's only moderately suspenseful.

178
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,920
Scott: It's just like, ugh, there's so much more before the end of this race.

179
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:16,134
Scott: It's only like two-thirds over, not even two-thirds over.

180
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:16,555
Scott: It's like 65% over.

181
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,580
Rym: I'm slowly catching up on the show, and all I have to say is that really, Midosuji is far away my favorite character.

182
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:25,239
Scott: Well, you also like Hell Orbs.

183
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:26,460
Rym: Yeah, I like Hell Orbs.

184
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,539
Scott: Rym likes Voldo, also.

185
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,639
Rym: I don't like Voldo, but I play Voldo.

186
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:34,300
Scott: You ever wonder when you're playing Soul Calibur and you see Voldo?

187
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,917
Scott: Like, who's Voldo?

188
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,300
Scott: And it's like, Voldo's the crazy guy in there, but you're like, who actually likes Voldo?

189
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:40,978
Rym: No one.

190
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,120
Scott: Who wants to play as Voldo?

191
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:43,617
Rym: No one.

192
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,668
Scott: Rym, Rym is the Voldo.

193
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,300
Scott: That's the person that you're wondering, where does that person exist?

194
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,912
Scott: Who likes Voldo and plays Voldo?

195
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:50,980
Scott: Rym is that person.

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,632
Rym: The thing is, I don't actually like Voldo.

197
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,415
Scott: Who likes Midosuji?

198
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:54,620
Scott: Rym.

199
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,399
Scott: Rym is the person who likes Midosuji.

200
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,460
Rym: But what happened was, when I'd play Soul Calibur, I usually would play like, what, Rafael?

201
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:02,779
Rym: Or, you know, Siegfried?

202
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,259
Scott: Siegfried is my guy since Soul Edge.

203
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,500
Rym: And I'd be okay.

204
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:10,656
Rym: It's actually one of the few fighting games I'm not that bad at.

205
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:11,460
Rym: I'm actually pretty good.

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,700
Scott: It makes a little bit more sense just to reality than other fighting games.

207
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,249
Rym: But no, I'm not tournament.

208
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:21,858
Rym: I'd be last place in even the lowest tier tournament.

209
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:22,400
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

210
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,060
Scott: Obviously.

211
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,260
Rym: But one day, I just started picking random characters while we were hanging out on the game of Cube.

212
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,019
Rym: And I got Voldo once, and I proceeded to never lose again.

213
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,280
Rym: And then I realized that Voldo, I guess, is my fighting game spirit animal.

214
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,260
Rym: So Midosuji is my bicycling spirit animal.

215
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:42,340
Rym: Alright.

216
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,560
Rym: I should get a tattoo of him on my bike leg just for biking.

217
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:49,260
Rym: Also, Google Image Search for him, and it is the best.

218
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:51,600
Rym: It is a sea of joy.

219
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,420
Scott: I don't Google Image Search, but I occasionally see fanarts on Twitter, and then I favorite them.

220
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,572
Rym: They're the best.

221
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:58,079
Rym: Midosuji.

222
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,400
Scott: If you look through my favorites on Twitter, you'll see a lot of fanarts.

223
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:05,700
Scott: I should make an app that goes through my favorites, collects all the fanarts, and makes a gallery.

224
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,219
Rym: That's actually not a bad idea.

225
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:22,879
Rym: So, in my news, my actual news, the Nerdosphere, at least the Man Nerdosphere, which is basically the Nerdosphere, is going crazy about the fact that Thor is a lady now.

226
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:24,025
Scott: What?

227
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:25,620
Scott: I don't know what you just said.

228
00:11:25,924 --> 00:11:26,479
Rym: Thor's a girl.

229
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,107
Scott: Oh, Thor.

230
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:28,875
Scott: Right, right.

231
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:29,360
Scott: That whole thing.

232
00:11:30,308 --> 00:11:31,060
Rym: Oh, Thor.

233
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,820
Scott: Well, okay, so first of all, people who don't know enough about comic books, right?

234
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:37,640
Rym: Yeah, now we're not talking about Norse mythology.

235
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,680
Scott: Right, so in Marvel comics, Thor has been a lady in the past.

236
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,574
Scott: Pretty much anyone...

237
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:45,135
Rym: Well, Emily tweeted something where it's like, "Yeah, Thor's been a

238
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:45,618
Rym: frog.".

239
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:52,277
Scott: Thor has been a lot of things, so basically anyone who picks up the hammer, right?

240
00:11:53,743 --> 00:11:56,660
Scott: If you try to pick up the hammer, you're either going to fail or become Thor.

241
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,359
Scott: Those are pretty much the two options, right?

242
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:09,952
Scott: So, you know, the original story is like this weak-ass dude picks it up, and Thor possesses him, basically, and he's sort of tortured because, you know, he's trying to live a life, but Thor also possesses him.

243
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:11,200
Scott: He's the God of Punder.

244
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:18,537
Scott: And eventually, at some point in the comics, Thor can do things on his own and doesn't need the weak dude or whatever.

245
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:18,920
Scott: I don't know.

246
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:25,819
Rym: Whoever holds this hammer, way up, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.

247
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,288
Scott: Well, explain how.

248
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,616
Scott: in, I'm pretty sure, the '80s, because she had a mohawk, Storm picked it up and turned to the Thor.

249
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:32,260
Scott: no problem.

250
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:37,419
Rym: I could explain that in a number of ways.

251
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,875
Scott: She's already the God of Thunder without the hammer, so the hammer is just like, "All right, you're already

252
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:44,178
Scott: Thor.".

253
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,940
Rym: Perhaps Storm is actually a man.

254
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:49,460
Scott: No, that is not the case.

255
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,998
Rym: Well, this is what I'm getting at.

256
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,720
Rym: The nerds in the Nerdosphere are really mad about this.

257
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:03,199
Scott: These are the same people who buy comic books, much like those in the New 52 that we read, with all the boobies and cheesecake all over them.

258
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,933
Scott: So, fuck whatever they have to say.

259
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:05,560
Scott: I don't give a shit.

260
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,020
Rym: So, I love the fact that this happened mostly because those people are mad.

261
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,919
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I really don't give a shit about, you know, Thor, what happens in any comic books.

262
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,200
Rym: I care a little bit about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but at this point...

263
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,480
Scott: I care less about that than I care about the comic books.

264
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,079
Rym: Got over lunch today, Emily was like, "Is there any superhero that you enjoy and follow to any

265
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:26,220
Rym: degree?"?

266
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:27,318
Scott: Me or you?

267
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:27,762
Rym: Me.

268
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:29,311
Rym: And I had to think long and hard.

269
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:29,674
Rym: I was like,

270
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:30,257
Rym: "Batman?".

271
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,158
Rym: And then she's like, "What's the most recent Batman you

272
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:33,379
Rym: like?".

273
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,152
Rym: And I was like, "Michael

274
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:35,675
Rym: Keaton?".

275
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,426
Rym: "B-TAS?".

276
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:45,520
Rym: But then I realized there is one superhero thing that I do actually follow.

277
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,440
Scott: Is it an animated technical superhero?

278
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:49,363
Rym: No, no.

279
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:51,073
Rym: So, I really like Teen Titans

280
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:51,375
Rym: Go!,

281
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:51,978
Rym: but again...

282
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:54,140
Scott: When was the last time you read a Teen Titans comic book?

283
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:58,120
Rym: I have never read a Teen Titans comic and never planned to, because I think they're stupid.

284
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:00,734
Scott: But you just admitted that you never read one.

285
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:01,500
Scott: How do you know they're stupid?

286
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,010
Rym: Well, I flipped through them.

287
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:04,120
Rym: I read excerpts.

288
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,059
Rym: I read summaries of the plot, and you know what?

289
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,100
Rym: There is no way to turn those plot points in a line into a story that I give even one fuck about.

290
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,278
Scott: Don't even start with that Wonder Girl bullshit, because let me tell you, that shit is fucked up.

291
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:19,348
Rym: So, this was the problem.

292
00:14:19,468 --> 00:14:24,860
Rym: All my favorite comic book superheroes, I like the things that aren't comics that are related to them.

293
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:30,100
Scott: I like comic books, but not perverted ones and not convoluted ones.

294
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,940
Rym: So, the Nerdosphere is mad, because Thor is a girl.

295
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,960
Rym: The Conservativosphere is mad, because Archie is dead.

296
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:38,634
Rym: Spoilers.

297
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,559
Scott: He's died before, let me tell you.

298
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,035
Rym: Yeah, he'll come back with like three more superpowers.

299
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:44,840
Rym: It'll be fine.

300
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:59,119
Rym: So, they're mad, because if you haven't paid attention, Archie dies taking a bullet for a gay friend of his, from like a terror assassination attempt, and the Conservativosphere is super mad about this.

301
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:06,340
Scott: Too bad the people who make Archie comics are in New York and are lefties, because they don't live in the sticks, so go fuck yourself.

302
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,660
Rym: So, I'm enjoying the rage about these two things kind of more than I enjoy the things.

303
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,200
Rym: I haven't read Archie, well, ever.

304
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,326
Scott: I don't know.

305
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:16,020
Scott: See, Archie getting killed, right?

306
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,929
Scott: Is that in the Archie comic?

307
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,000
Scott: Because there's so many different Archie comics.

308
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:20,820
Rym: Honestly.

309
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,160
Scott: It's like some of them don't count, right?

310
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,820
Scott: It's sort of like this one that's like the canon, and then this other one where they are in high school forever for some reason.

311
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:37,239
Scott: And then there's other ones, it's like Betty and Veronica, and it's like, is that even match up canonically in the same continuity as the main one?

312
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:43,376
Rym: There are two Adventure Time episodes that aren't canon, but we have word of God that the My Little Pony comics are 100% canon.

313
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,700
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, okay, look, so there's Adventure Time comics, right?

314
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,620
Scott: Those aren't canon, but then there's other Adventure Time comics, like Yuko did Candy Capers.

315
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,278
Scott: Is that even canon along with the Adventure Time comics, let alone the show?

316
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,379
Scott: Or is it just a completely separate thing again?

317
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,623
Rym: And you know what?

318
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:05,299
Rym: There's only one type of sphere that cares about that.

319
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,738
Rym: The Nerdosphere.

320
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:14,820
Rym: So, things of the day.

321
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:16,960
Rym: We don't talk about him a lot anymore.

322
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,400
Rym: You can find some ancient episodes of GeekNights about it, but I'm actually still really into anime music videos.

323
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,900
Rym: That's always been a thing that I really liked about fan culture in the US.

324
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:35,600
Scott: I do really like anime music videos, we've done episodes on them, but it's just because of the way I've been living, and not going to an anime club and such, and not being in college.

325
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,020
Rym: You need someone else who will watch all the bullshit to find good ones.

326
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:43,179
Scott: Yeah, and I'm not going to the AMV contest at conventions either, right?

327
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:57,200
Scott: And I just haven't really seen, even the ones I've seen in recent years, and I have seen some that are supposedly winners at various conventions and things, they don't even hold up to non-winners that I've seen back in the day.

328
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:05,917
Rym: I mean, I think the peak was the last Otakon we went to, where at the closing ceremonies they were like, "So, this AMV that got submitted didn't win

329
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:06,420
Rym: anything.".

330
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,380
Scott: Yeah, the honorable mention was way, way better than all the other ones, and I don't even remember the ones that won.

331
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,055
Rym: Yeah, the staff were basically like, "No one voted for this video, but it was so amazing that we gave it an award.

332
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:16,657
Rym: Watch it right

333
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:16,880
Rym: now.".

334
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,592
Rym: And then they showed it to us, and it was that 25/25 video.

335
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,299
Scott: I don't even remember the other ones they showed us that actually won, and they're probably not that good.

336
00:17:24,363 --> 00:17:24,483
Rym: Yup.

337
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,400
Rym: So, what I have for you is a music video that I actually really like.

338
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:30,520
Scott: It was also a convention winner at some point.

339
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,160
Rym: Yup, it's a pretty old one, but it's The Circus by Britney Spears.

340
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,000
Scott: Well, it's not by Britney Spears, it's performed by Britney Spears on an autotune machine.

341
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:46,219
Scott: The Britney Spears... And that guy that I did in Thing of the Day about a while ago, the Northern European dude...

342
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,240
Rym: You already forgot his name, didn't you?

343
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,839
Scott: Yeah, but he's the one who made the song.

344
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:50,139
Scott: I'm pretty sure it is.

345
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:56,480
Rym: I had to make it clear, because the best Utena video ever made is to "Hit Me Baby One More Time," not performed by Britney Spears.

346
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,320
Scott: Yeah, but I'm pretty sure that song was also made by that same dude.

347
00:17:59,480 --> 00:17:59,650
Scott: Probably.

348
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:04,520
Scott: I want to give him the credit and not the pretend... Or, man, the computer gets to have the performing credit anyway.

349
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:18,299
Rym: It doesn't really spoil, but just so you know what the deal is with this video, it's pretty much set to some sort of Sailor Scouts that are working with the Dead Moon Circus, which is the big villain in Sailor Moon Super S.

350
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:22,472
Scott: Which only... Which comes after... Does it exist to make Sailor Moon dead?

351
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:23,540
Scott: Is that the reason it's called dead?

352
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:25,079
Rym: It's more complicated than that.

353
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:32,400
Rym: It has to do with there's this circus that's trying to raise this greater, much more horrible thing named Queen Nahalania from the dead.

354
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,220
Rym: So it's sort of a Zomogusta situation.

355
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:36,060
Scott: How can a circus raise someone from the dead?

356
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,160
Rym: It's complicated, and also it's Sailor Moon.

357
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:46,280
Rym: I mean, why does a green lantern... What exactly is the wavelength difference between Green Lantern's power and some other lantern's power?

358
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:49,740
Scott: I don't know, but she should just throw a tiara at this circus and be done with it in one episode.

359
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,400
Rym: Yeah, that tiara doesn't really work much in later episodes.

360
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,500
Rym: That's not that powerful.

361
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,917
Scott: All right, well just throw two tiaras at it.

362
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:56,220
Scott: I don't know.

363
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,271
Scott: Everyone else has tiaras.

364
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:57,939
Scott: They ain't throwing them.

365
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:21,820
Rym: Anyway, if you're on the fence about watching current Sailor Moon, like the old one, as it's coming out again, being re-released in English with a dub, and not censoring anything like the Deke releases did, hold out, because much like how Utena goes from "Hey, we're fighting over a girl" to "Cars," Sailor Moon gets increasingly freaky as time goes on, and this is just a sampling of the freakiness into which it gets.

366
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:22,760
Scott: I like this video.

367
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,500
Rym: Also, I really like these characters.

368
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:34,039
Rym: They're the best part of Sailor Moon's Super S. Granted, Super S is not nearly as good as S, which has all that Holy Grail, End of the World, Sailor Saturn, Outer Senchi stuff.

369
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,800
Scott: How many episodes is each of these series?

370
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:38,320
Rym: That's so far away.

371
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,949
Rym: The first 50-something episodes are just "Oh my God, Queen Beryl.

372
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:42,857
Rym: Oh my God, Queen

373
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:43,159
Rym: Beryl."

374
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,040
Rym: And the four whatevers.

375
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,200
Rym: And then the Moonlight Knight.

376
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,380
Rym: And then the Dark Moon whatever.

377
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,660
Rym: And I just don't care about any of that.

378
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:50,898
Rym: And Alan and Anne and their tree.

379
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,139
Rym: I don't care about any of that.

380
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,478
Rym: And then it gets good.

381
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:58,520
Scott: Well, I guess that's why Utena's better, right?

382
00:19:58,882 --> 00:20:01,130
Scott: There's no part of Utena where you're like, "Mickey and his bullshit.

383
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,899
Scott: Don't care about that.

384
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:03,033
Scott: Just get to the

385
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:03,338
Scott: cars.".

386
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:06,797
Rym: Sometimes I think like, "Oh, I don't want to watch episode three of Utena

387
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:07,080
Rym: again.".

388
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:07,738
Scott: I guess you do.

389
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:09,635
Rym: It's like, "Oh, I never noticed that before.

390
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:09,897
Rym: Take

391
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:10,159
Rym: notes.".

392
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:12,840
Rym: But no, don't get me wrong.

393
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:16,020
Rym: Sailor Moon, even the early episodes, it's super enjoyable to watch.

394
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:17,520
Scott: I mean, in Sailor Moon, there's some stuff.

395
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,100
Scott: It's like, "Oh, let's rewatch that episode.

396
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:20,180
Scott: Oh, take notes.

397
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,717
Scott: Norio Wakamoto is the voice of that

398
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:21,940
Scott: dude.".

399
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,133
Scott: Yeah.

400
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:29,360
Rym: But if we did Geek Knights Presents Sailor Moon, our episode of each episode would be about 30 seconds long.

401
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,060
Scott: Probably.

402
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,079
Scott: Maybe a minute.

403
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,359
Scott: The monster of the week was this, and she killed it with a tiara.

404
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,120
Scott: Monster of the week was that, and also tiara is still in the zone.

405
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,420
Rym: Also, did a plot thing happen?

406
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,933
Rym: It's like, "Oh, and this one, she actually tried to stab

407
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:40,397
Rym: somebody.".

408
00:20:41,022 --> 00:20:45,020
Scott: Oh, she actually kicked people in this episode, took initiative, and Tuxedo Mask did not help.

409
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,459
Rym: Yeah, where was Tuxedo Mask?

410
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:48,020
Scott: He was at the arcade.

411
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:48,638
Rym: We saw him.

412
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,377
Rym: With his friend.

413
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:52,239
Scott: And his really too big shirt that was like a dress.

414
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,055
Rym: Oh, my God.

415
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,714
Rym: Mamoru dresses like a pot.

416
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,559
Rym: I don't know what else to say.

417
00:20:58,503 --> 00:21:00,700
Scott: I don't dress nicely, but I dress more nicely than that.

418
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:07,666
Rym: Well, Onorobo did a great takedown of the tuxedo he's wearing in Crystal, and basically, she was like, "This is wrong.

419
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:08,373
Rym: This is wrong.

420
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,100
Rym: This is wrong.

421
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:12,074
Rym: That is literally the worst white tie tuxedo anyone's ever

422
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:12,438
Rym: worn.".

423
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:12,914
Rym: Mm-hmm.

424
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:14,374
Rym: And she fixed it.

425
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,140
Rym: So you got a thing of the day?

426
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:18,420
Scott: I do have a thing of the day.

427
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:20,000
Scott: So there's this girl.

428
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:24,540
Scott: Her name is Casey Kentanzaro.

429
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:26,775
Rym: Yeah, so if you type K-A-C-Y...

430
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,480
Scott: There's not a lot of people named Casey, who have any amount of fame whatsoever.

431
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,137
Rym: Casey Green.

432
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,719
Scott: That's Casey.

433
00:21:33,448 --> 00:21:33,719
Scott: Casey?

434
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,416
Scott: K-A-C-Y.

435
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,380
Rym: As opposed to Casey?

436
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:35,980
Scott: Anyway.

437
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,979
Scott: So she's just some badass gymnast girl, right?

438
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,999
Scott: She probably did gymnastics her whole life.

439
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:45,857
Scott: And there's that remake of "Ninja

440
00:21:45,877 --> 00:21:46,220
Scott: Warrior."

441
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:49,079
Scott: The real name of it is... I forget.

442
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:54,059
Scott: Anyway, the Japanese show is the real show.

443
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,780
Scott: The American show... I guess the obstacle courses are similarly evil, but the announcers are infuriatingly...

444
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,360
Rym: So how tall is Casey?

445
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:05,660
Scott: She's only five feet tall.

446
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,399
Rym: What's a wingspan?

447
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,680
Scott: Oh my God, can you believe that she's only five feet tall?

448
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,635
Scott: She's got no wingspan.

449
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,620
Scott: And she's only 100 pounds.

450
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,840
Scott: Oh my God, can you believe it?

451
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:13,739
Scott: Let me repeat that for you ten times.

452
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,134
Scott: Wingspan.

453
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,960
Scott: The announcers need to die in a fire.

454
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,580
Scott: I'd rather just have unintelligible Japanese voices.

455
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,339
Scott: That'd be much better.

456
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:24,450
Rym: Or even the fake dubs from some of those other shows, like "Tekashi's

457
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,880
Rym: Castle."

458
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:25,158
Rym: Right.

459
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:33,019
Scott: But she does this obstacle course at the Dallas finals, so I guess it's like they have different difficulties based on how high in the competition it is.

460
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:41,999
Scott: So I guess if you go to a city final, it's like this is the course that you get, and I guess if you go to a regional or something, it's even harder, and then the national's even harder and so forth.

461
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:48,020
Scott: But apparently no girl ever, no female ever, has gotten past a certain part.

462
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:52,819
Scott: Not only does she get past that part, she just gets to the end of a thing that most dudes just fail immediately.

463
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:53,392
Rym: Yep.

464
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,219
Rym: It's pretty amazing to watch.

465
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,360
Scott: And at first, it's sort of like, "Okay, yeah, she's a professional gymnast.

466
00:22:58,461 --> 00:22:59,899
Scott: Of course she would get past that part.

467
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:00,288
Scott: Of

468
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:00,619
Scott: course.".

469
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:01,880
Scott: And it doesn't look that impressive.

470
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,739
Rym: But then that red thing.

471
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:11,034
Scott: But yeah, but then there's the red thing that purposefully leans away from where you're supposed to jump to, and it's just like, "Oh, oh my

472
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:11,276
Scott: God.".

473
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:14,476
Scott: So just put it on mute and watch it.

474
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,080
Rym: So in the meta moment, our Book Club book is currently a Canticle for Liebowitz.

475
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:20,878
Rym: I should read books.

476
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,349
Rym: Yeah.

477
00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:25,738
Rym: I'm working on my fourth novel since I finished it, waiting for Scott to read it.

478
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:26,839
Scott: I'll read some books.

479
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,759
Rym: Yeah, read some books.

480
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,236
Scott: Maybe when I have to read some comic books.

481
00:23:30,162 --> 00:23:34,140
Rym: And if you're a new listener, to keep it brief, we have a forum, and it's fucking amazing.

482
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:40,360
Rym: And we also have two YouTube channels, mine and Scott's, that have a lot of video of a lot of things we've done.

483
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,880
Scott: Mine is 90% Netrunner videos and 1% bicycling and fireworks videos.

484
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,118
Rym: Mine is mostly our own lectures and panels and all the other shows that we do, like GeekNights Presents, The things you probably want to watch.

485
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:54,359
Scott: Unless you care about Netrunner, bicycles, or fireworks.

486
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,697
Rym: Yeah, Radio Free Equestria, all that kind of stuff.

487
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,699
Scott: Maybe I'll make some other kinds of videos.

488
00:23:59,743 --> 00:24:05,279
Rym: I might put up a time lapse of what it looks like from panel ops at ConnectiCon for an entire day.

489
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:06,520
Rym: Anyway.

490
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,120
Scott: Did you actually keep replacing the GoPro battery?

491
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,080
Rym: All day?

492
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,020
Rym: Yes, until I ran out of GoPro batteries and I realized I forgot my GoPro battery charger.

493
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,700
Rym: And I thought, oh, there's a dead time now.

494
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,340
Rym: I'll charge one of the batteries in the GoPro.

495
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,180
Rym: Nope, micro USB.

496
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:21,979
Scott: No, it's mini USB.

497
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:22,715
Rym: Yup.

498
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:25,960
Scott: Oh, you only brought the micro USB cables.

499
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,258
Rym: I forgot I even own anything that takes mini USB.

500
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,479
Scott: GoPros are mini USB.

501
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,200
Rym: Thanks GoPro.

502
00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:31,639
Scott: I could have told you that.

503
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:32,760
Rym: Yeah, I just forgot.

504
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:35,560
Rym: When was the last time I plugged a USB cable into one of those?

505
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,000
Scott: GoPros are also mini HDMI.

506
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,655
Scott: My camera is micro HDMI.

507
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,879
Rym: I have both a mini and a micro cable just because.

508
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,179
Rym: Apparently no one presenting at the con did.

509
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,520
Scott: Other meta moments.

510
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,360
Scott: The next convention is all the way in September, August-ish time, Labor Day weekend.

511
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,899
Scott: It's PAX, the real PAX.

512
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,539
Rym: The Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle.

513
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:56,580
Scott: It's sold out.

514
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,100
Scott: Why are you even bothered telling you about it?

515
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,500
Scott: If you're going already, you're going.

516
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:00,360
Scott: We will be there.

517
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,158
Scott: You know it.

518
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,220
Rym: It's going to be awesome.

519
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,576
Rym: We're going to be at that same charity dinner that we went to last year before it, but that appears to be sold out, too.

520
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:08,496
Scott: Yep.

521
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,159
Rym: So, yeah, if you already planned on going, we'll see you there.

522
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:15,180
Rym: If not, we'll see you at some other point, maybe.

523
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:15,893
Scott: Mm-hmm.

524
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:19,441
Rym: After that, I guess our next -- well, my next convention, at least, is.

525
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:23,760
Rym: it looks like I am going to PAX Australia, so I'm going to sort all that business out.

526
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,700
Rym: Scott can decide at any point if he's coming.

527
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:26,519
Scott: I don't know.

528
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,259
Scott: It might be too late.

529
00:25:27,885 --> 00:25:28,016
Rym: Yeah.

530
00:25:28,381 --> 00:25:29,879
Rym: I still got to, like, book plane tickets and all that.

531
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,250
Scott: Yeah.

532
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:34,880
Scott: And then I guess after that, PAX South/Magfest.

533
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,314
Rym: Yep.

534
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,560
Scott: All the way in January.

535
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,100
Rym: Yep.

536
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,639
Rym: So it's finally, finally convention season's coming down, which means -- Well, we could go to more conventions if you wanted to.

537
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:44,400
Rym: Actually, you know what I kind of want to do instead?

538
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,400
Rym: Just rent a place to sleep in Wildwood and just go?

539
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,339
Scott: We can do whatever we want.

540
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,980
Rym: Yeah, I think that's -- I got to go to a beach.

541
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,799
Scott: Let me quit my job and do whatever I want.

542
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:54,260
Rym: All right.

543
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,359
Rym: Let me quit my -- tell you what.

544
00:25:55,944 --> 00:25:56,797
Rym: I will work for you.

545
00:25:57,621 --> 00:26:07,359
Rym: As long as you pay for me to have food and pay my rent, I will make as much media as you want for up to 15 hours a week, because the rest of the time I'm going to be biking and laying on the beach.

546
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,036
Rym: So, yeah.

547
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,456
Rym: Sailor Moon.

548
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:11,618
Rym: Crystal.

549
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:20,000
Scott: So there's only one episode of this, and I thought we'd have a second episode by now, but apparently it's coming out once every two weeks or some bullshit like that.

550
00:26:20,142 --> 00:26:20,737
Scott: I don't even know.

551
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:21,792
Rym: Yep.

552
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,760
Rym: So we're not really fully reviewing this.

553
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,459
Rym: I'm not going to pretend.

554
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,819
Rym: We're not going to pull our, like, judge anime -- But we don't need to fully review this.

555
00:26:29,497 --> 00:26:29,620
Rym: Yeah.

556
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,699
Rym: We're going to watch every episode as it comes out, because even if it ends up not being that good, it's important enough that we're going to have to talk about this shit.

557
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,059
Rym: So I have some concerns.

558
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,860
Scott: You're concerned?

559
00:26:40,942 --> 00:26:41,700
Scott: I'm also concerned.

560
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:55,060
Rym: So having watched the first episode, it's pretty much the same as the first chunk of the manga, pretty much the same as the first episode of the old anime, but the animation actually I think is worse in many ways.

561
00:26:55,424 --> 00:26:55,639
Scott: Oh, yeah.

562
00:26:55,761 --> 00:27:00,778
Scott: So, I mean, we knew from the screenshots that, like, it was using a different kind of art style than the old show.

563
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,889
Rym: Which I'm fine with.

564
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,860
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

565
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:11,339
Scott: You can use whatever art style you want, and I thought that the art style used more looked like some of the manga, right, than, you know, the old show did.

566
00:27:13,162 --> 00:27:19,959
Scott: But seeing it animated, it's like you can see tons and tons of people online showing you examples, and they're all right.

567
00:27:20,482 --> 00:27:21,580
Scott: Every single one of them is correct.

568
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,340
Scott: They're showing you, like, how the facial expressions are not as expressive.

569
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:30,320
Rym: Everyone has the same sort of doughy-eyed look all the time.

570
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,820
Scott: Yeah, and how the poses are not dynamic or exciting.

571
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,960
Rym: It's like the show, the first episode.

572
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:44,600
Scott: It's like the colors are brighter and the resolution is higher, but there's just no energy in the movement of anything.

573
00:27:45,120 --> 00:28:00,680
Rym: It reminds me of a lot of the assignments I would turn in back at university, where it technically meets all the requirements of a moderately to big-budgetedly made anime, and it hits all the required points of Sailor Moon, but it has zero charm.

574
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:08,779
Rym: Watching the first episode of the old Sailor Moon actually was really funny, and really, like, I really liked it.

575
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:20,914
Scott: Yeah, it's like I'm just, you know, you watch the new one, and it's like there's a cut scene where they transform, and they've seen it 10,000 times, but it's like every time she says she's going to punish you, it's like,

576
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:21,058
Scott: "Yeah!".

577
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,617
Rym: Oh, shiokio.

578
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,338
Rym: Meanwhile, the new one, let's get right into it.

579
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:33,237
Rym: The transformation sequence that we see the first time, which traditionally, when there's stock animation, like-- The first time it comes out is insane.

580
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:41,500
Rym: Yes, and then every other time it comes out, you watch it because it probably had a huge budget and was probably had a ton of attention put into it.

581
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,779
Scott: Watch your 10 and walk up them stairs over and over again.

582
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:57,400
Rym: This transformation sequence is obviously kind of, like, slap dashingly put together cel-shaded 3D, and they didn't even bother making the poses dynamic, and it just kind of looks like shit.

583
00:28:57,681 --> 00:28:59,530
Scott: It's not even that it looks bad, it's just.

584
00:28:59,591 --> 00:29:03,560
Scott: it doesn't give you any-- it doesn't make you feel, like, excited at all.

585
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,635
Scott: It's just like, "Uh..." It doesn't have the feeling in it, just like, "Yeah, I'm going to fuck you up with my shit.

586
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:10,098
Rym: Here it

587
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:10,380
Rym: comes.".

588
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,980
Rym: But the cel-shaded 3D part, when she kind of leans forward and moves a little bit, like, it looks bad.

589
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,037
Rym: It stands out as, "Hey, that's way more CG than the other

590
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:19,359
Rym: parts.".

591
00:29:19,642 --> 00:29:20,659
Scott: That is definitely true.

592
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:26,219
Rym: And it worries me because it's kind of like when people started making all these MOBAs.

593
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:31,660
Rym: So they're taking an old thing, Dota, and they're trying to figure out what parts of it are important and make a new version.

594
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:37,699
Rym: I worry that the people making Sailor Moon Crystal are picking the wrong parts to put their attentions on.

595
00:29:38,805 --> 00:29:41,799
Rym: And that worries me a lot, because I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

596
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,379
Scott: Well, we can just watch the old one again instead.

597
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:44,958
Rym: I'm going to watch the old one.

598
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,199
Scott: We'll eventually get to that circus.

599
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,460
Rym: Oh, you're going to like that circus.

600
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:51,400
Scott: All right, so other things about Sailor Moon Crystal that are problematic, right?

601
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,594
Scott: So, just, you know, first of all, she doesn't say, "Moon tiara

602
00:29:54,737 --> 00:29:54,960
Scott: action.".

603
00:29:55,041 --> 00:30:01,360
Scott: She says, "Moon tiara boomerang," which also completely lacks energy and doesn't even fit, really.

604
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,160
Scott: It just sounds bad.

605
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,500
Rym: Does action fit so much better?

606
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:06,552
Scott: It just sounds more forceful, like,

607
00:30:06,774 --> 00:30:07,238
Scott: "Action!".

608
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,180
Rym: Are you sure that isn't just because you saw Sailor Moon old first?

609
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:15,020
Scott: It's not even what the word is.

610
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,040
Scott: It's just that it has three syllables, so it doesn't have the same attacking power.

611
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,720
Scott: I'm not going to nitpick to that level.

612
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,577
Scott: I don't like it.

613
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,620
Scott: If it was any other two-syllable word, it would have worked, right?

614
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:36,927
Scott: It could have been, like, "attack" or "hookshot" or something, but the three syllables sort of, you know, it's like when someone's telling a poem and they mess up the last word, and it's like,

615
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:37,132
Scott: "Eh.".

616
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:48,920
Rym: So, there is something interesting with the new Sailor Moon, though, because the old one, you know, it's 200 episodes, going all the way up through Sailor Stars, and it moves kind of slow.

617
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,800
Rym: I mean, new sailors appear.

618
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,379
Scott: You don't say.

619
00:30:51,741 --> 00:30:52,480
Rym: Like, the new one, what?

620
00:30:53,062 --> 00:30:54,416
Rym: How many sailors go outside of there right now?

621
00:30:54,517 --> 00:30:54,740
Rym: Three?

622
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,459
Scott: Well, if you count Sailor Moon, yeah.

623
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:58,579
Scott: And Sailor V, I mean, you know about.

624
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,400
Rym: Yeah, but she's off doing her own thing.

625
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,459
Scott: You don't even know what she's up to.

626
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:05,880
Rym: So, do you know what the titles are for the first three episodes of the new Sailor Moon, Sailor Moon Crystal?

627
00:31:05,983 --> 00:31:06,294
Rym: Mm-hmm.

628
00:31:06,621 --> 00:31:08,299
Rym: Episode one, Sailor Moon.

629
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:11,100
Rym: Episode two, Sailor Mercury.

630
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:13,780
Rym: Episode three, Sailor Mars.

631
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,340
Scott: All right, one per episode.

632
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:18,460
Scott: So, is that the pace the manga went at, though?

633
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,180
Rym: The manga moves pretty quick, because it doesn't really have the same monster of the week thing going on.

634
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,340
Rym: Granted, I have not read that much of the manga.

635
00:31:24,661 --> 00:31:32,980
Scott: So, that's what I've been told, is that it's sort of doing this, it's following the manga pretty closely, and that's, you know, the pacing in the manga is faster and does not have monsters of the week.

636
00:31:33,081 --> 00:31:34,140
Scott: So, that's perfectly okay.

637
00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:35,460
Rym: And that's, in fact, what I wanted.

638
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,193
Rym: Yeah.

639
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,780
Rym: But, there's no charm, there's no energy.

640
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,500
Rym: I don't really, I already started losing interest in the first episode.

641
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:59,760
Scott: So, one thing that also noticed that was a significant difference, and I don't know what the manga's like in this regard, is that Sailor Moon and, obviously, Tuxedo Mask, but not Tuxedo Mask Guy, right, weren't just fighting and hating each other immediately.

642
00:32:00,522 --> 00:32:01,779
Scott: She was all blushing and shit.

643
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,919
Rym: It's not Darien being weird and kind of a, like, needless dick.

644
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:05,678
Scott: Right.

645
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:16,040
Rym: Instead, it's Mamoru being cool and mysterious in his really badly put together tuxedo that, apparently, he just wears- And he's actually wearing the tuxedo on the street, as opposed to wearing doofy clothes.

646
00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:16,536
Rym: Yup.

647
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:19,859
Scott: And he's got a Dracula amulet on his neck.

648
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:20,380
Rym: Yup.

649
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,508
Scott: Like he's fucking Dracula or some shit, and then he wears the same one when he's- Yup.

650
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:27,280
Rym: And also, he's like, "I'm looking for the crystal, blah, blah, blah.

651
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:27,671
Rym: I have a

652
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:27,879
Rym: plot.".

653
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:30,300
Rym: Not just, "Who's the guy in the tuxedo who keeps showing

654
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,360
Rym: up?".

655
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,940
Scott: Well, that's actually a good part.

656
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,212
Scott: Yes.

657
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,112
Scott: That's a positive.

658
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:41,037
Scott: There are some positives, but the negative that they weren't fighting sort of, you know, that removes a whole element of the show, right?

659
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:47,940
Scott: It's like, "Oh, they're going to get together," and they do, as opposed to, "They're fighting, and then they're going to get together," which is completely different.

660
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,152
Rym: But in terms of, you know, so even if they're going at this pace, it's scheduled to be 26 episodes.

661
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:57,055
Scott: What's going to happen at the end of the 26 episodes?

662
00:32:58,203 --> 00:33:05,100
Rym: There is no way this is getting anywhere past Queen Beryl and Metallo, whatever, and all that stuff.

663
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,560
Rym: So at best, it's going to cover the first main arc of Sailor Moon.

664
00:33:10,141 --> 00:33:12,120
Rym: So there's definitely going to be no holy grail.

665
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,260
Scott: Yeah, but at least the pace is going.

666
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
Scott: We can see Jedi get the axe in episode four.

667
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:15,730
Scott: Yeah.

668
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:17,740
Rym: If not sooner.

669
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:21,900
Rym: The show should start, and the first scene is just Jedi's grave.

670
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:23,599
Rym: [laughter].

671
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:27,340
Rym: So we'll see.

672
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:40,160
Rym: So I was looking around a little bit more because, you know, I haven't really paid attention to a lot of the creative team for Sailor Moon, and the director, Munahisa Sakai, doesn't have a lot listed here in the Anime News Network.

673
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:49,779
Rym: It's mostly production advancement for Dragon Ball Z movies 10, 11, and 12, and directing two one-piece movies.

674
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:51,500
Scott: Oh, well, one-piece movies.

675
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:54,200
Rym: Strong World and Dream Soccer King!

676
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,200
Scott: Ooh, soccer and one-piece together.

677
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,819
Scott: Every Japanese kid would just write their favorite fucking movie of all time.

678
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:07,700
Rym: So I don't know anything about this person, and Anime News Network did not give me enough to go on.

679
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:09,199
Scott: I mean, I haven't read.

680
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,280
Scott: I'm sure other people know the correct things that have happened in the production of this show.

681
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:28,813
Scott: I know there were delays involved, but I get the feeling, just knowing that it was delayed and from seeing the end result, that they made this because they felt they had to because the anniversary is something that, you know, Sailor Moon was big in Japan, unlike some other things which are only big in the

682
00:34:28,915 --> 00:34:29,217
Scott: U.S.,

683
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:29,639
Scott: right?

684
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:34,639
Scott: You don't have that many hundreds of episodes made of something that's not popular, right?

685
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:43,880
Scott: It was really popular there, and it's the anniversary of it, so I think they felt they had to do this, just like they made Macross Zero on the anniversary of Macross.

686
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,188
Rym: Yup.

687
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:51,400
Scott: So but they're doing it because they had to, but no one necessarily wanted to or felt they had to, you know, put a big effort into it.

688
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:57,609
Scott: People were putting in a big effort of putting it in on new things, not on something that you feel like, "Oh, we have to do this.

689
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,435
Scott: Okay, let's do

690
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:58,536
Scott: it.".

691
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,580
Scott: So it's sort of like, you know, you can tell watching it that it's like not even the B team.

692
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:06,834
Scott: It's like the C team.

693
00:35:06,915 --> 00:35:08,920
Scott: It's just like, "All right, guys, just make something.

694
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,734
Scott: I don't even give a shit about how quality it is.

695
00:35:10,754 --> 00:35:11,077
Scott: Just do

696
00:35:11,117 --> 00:35:11,158
Scott: it.".

697
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,219
Rym: Yup, and that's my worry.

698
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:22,499
Rym: Unless it moves at such a pace that I'll keep going with it just because it's dragging me along and the plot's moving rapidly and I want to see all the stuff that I know.

699
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:32,320
Rym: It's subtext in the old anime, but there's a lot to that subtext in the manga around some of the villains and some of the pasts of some of these people and all these things.

700
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:41,000
Rym: I wonder if this show is going to address all that or not, and I'm really curious where it's going to go, but I'm getting a Kazen no Yojimbo feeling.

701
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:48,245
Scott: I'm also curious, right, you know, because I've never been to Japan in my life, but we know even in the

702
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:48,728
Scott: U.S.,

703
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:55,300
Scott: even among non-nerds, right, nostalgia and licensed properties can sell, right?

704
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,249
Scott: Look at Transformers.

705
00:35:56,289 --> 00:36:13,878
Scott: You don't need to keep it accurate, but you can sell some old licensed property to everyone, and a lot of non-nerds watch Transformers as a kid or at least know it's a thing, and so because it was popular once, you can sell it again, and it has guaranteed sales because of that, even amongst non-nerds.

706
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,880
Scott: In Japan, how much nostalgia is there really?

707
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,380
Rym: Well, I can say one thing.

708
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:19,481
Scott: Right?

709
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:26,240
Scott: Can you sell Sailor Moon just because it was once popular or will only the otakus buy it and not the normal people won't give any shits?

710
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,900
Scott: So a few years ago-- Or can you sell Sailor Moon to everyone?

711
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,279
Rym: A few years ago when I was in Japan with Emily, we saw a lot of Madoka stuff around because--.

712
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,340
Scott: Well, that was a new thing.

713
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,018
Rym: That was the hot thing.

714
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,356
Scott: Right.

715
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:40,400
Rym: But we also saw equal if not more Fist of the North Star.

716
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,080
Scott: But was that only in Nerd Zone?

717
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,439
Rym: Oh, that was outside.

718
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,380
Rym: It was in Nerd Zones, but it would edge into non-nerd zones.

719
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,359
Rym: Like, you'd see it there.

720
00:36:48,823 --> 00:36:50,160
Scott: But did you see Sailor Moon anywhere?

721
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:52,819
Rym: Ah, in the Nerd Zones, I saw Sailor Moon.

722
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,500
Rym: I don't recall seeing Sailor Moon anywhere that was not a Nerd Zone.

723
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,519
Scott: Well, I mean, they weren't selling it at the time, right?

724
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,520
Scott: But then again, they weren't selling Fist of the North Star at the time.

725
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,060
Scott: What Fist of the North Star anime or manga is there to sell?

726
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,720
Rym: Nothing will ever prove my points about media and anime.

727
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,798
Scott: Your anecdotes won't prove anything?

728
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:10,980
Scott: What?

729
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,113
Rym: Then that moment where I found there was this Japanese variety show from, like, the late '90s, early 2000s.

730
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,270
Rym: And I think it was the early 2000s.

731
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:27,238
Rym: And offhandedly, one guy just makes a reference to Fist of the North Star and everybody gets it.

732
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:28,529
Rym: Everybody.

733
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:29,380
Rym: The audience laughs.

734
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,360
Rym: The old host of this variety show thing starts laughing.

735
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:39,550
Rym: He's like... I don't know if Sailor Moon still has that level of penetration.

736
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:45,750
Scott: Could you go on a Japanese variety show and be like, in the name of something, I'll punish you and have people know what you're talking about?

737
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:46,861
Rym: They might?

738
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:47,288
Rym: I don't know.

739
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,710
Scott: They might get the joke, but are people still buying it, right?

740
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,006
Rym: Yeah.

741
00:37:53,173 --> 00:37:53,808
Rym: So, we'll see.

742
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:56,089
Rym: Like I said, I have some concerns.

743
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,070
Rym: I'm a little worried that this is not going to be that great.

744
00:37:59,912 --> 00:38:07,169
Rym: I worry that a lot of people who are really into it are lying to themselves, like I have done with anime that I thought I should like in the past.

745
00:38:09,274 --> 00:38:12,029
Rym: If it's bad, it's okay to stop watching it.

746
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:17,109
Scott: I think it's just that people here, you know, they like Sailor Moon so much.

747
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:22,945
Scott: And it is still... I didn't watch it back then and it's still good.

748
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:30,190
Rym: I think that re-releasing the old Sailor Moon high quality is going to hurt Sailor Moon Crystal.

749
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:32,470
Rym: Because as I watch them both in parallel...

750
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:34,310
Scott: If you're watching one, you might as well watch both.

751
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:48,129
Rym: But as I'm watching them in parallel, it really makes the lack of energy and lack of care stand out watching the old one, which was obviously made with a lot of love, and watching this new sort of clinical reinterpretation.

752
00:38:50,255 --> 00:38:54,386
Scott: The re-release of the old one is going to continue well, long after Sailor Moon Crystal is over, so...

753
00:38:54,951 --> 00:38:55,165
Rym: Yup.

754
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,505
Rym: But it's just that's it.

755
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:00,050
Rym: The first episode of any show has to draw you in.

756
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:07,490
Rym: In fact, usually we complain about shows where the first episode is so amazing that you'll watch ten more before you realize the show is actually stupid.

757
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,730
Rym: The Yu Yu Hockey Show, Naruto... Bleach.

758
00:39:12,673 --> 00:39:14,409
Rym: What other show really bothered me?

759
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,249
Rym: Eden of the East.

760
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:16,550
Scott: Blue Earth SOS.

761
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,909
Rym: In fact, we did a panel on that.

762
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:22,330
Rym: So, it kind of worries me that the first episode...

763
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,390
Scott: Oh, Eden of the East, yeah.

764
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,124
Scott: Yeah, Eden of the East.

765
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,850
Rym: It's like every episode was worse than the previous one, and the end of that show was a bad anime.

766
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:34,930
Rym: But the first episode looked like it was going to be the best anime to come out that year, if not, like, that decade.

767
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:40,369
Scott: Get Backers had, like, two, three good episodes before it devolved into Shonen Fighting Tournament up a tower.

768
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:43,449
Rym: So, we'll see what happens.

769
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,810
Rym: Not super excited.

770
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,849
Rym: Gonna keep watching it.

771
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,890
Rym: Maybe they'll bring it around.

772
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:51,009
Rym: Might just be too clinical, too by the book, too soulless.

773
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:53,970
Scott: Trying to make it do.

774
00:39:55,419 --> 00:39:55,769
Rym: Not really.

775
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:56,221
Rym: Yeah.

776
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,550
Rym: What joke would I be making?

777
00:39:58,472 --> 00:40:00,630
Scott: Sailor Moon is, like, only some people have souls and shit.

778
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:01,169
Rym: Oh, yeah.

779
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,470
Rym: I guess I wouldn't try to make that joke, because you haven't seen any of that yet.

780
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,409
Scott: But you already told me that.

781
00:40:05,713 --> 00:40:06,290
Rym: I did explain something.

782
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,369
Scott: And I really don't care either.

783
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,950
Rym: I'm surprised you paid attention enough to what I was saying about Sailor Moon.

784
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,969
Scott: It's impossible to spoil a Monster of the Week show.

785
00:40:19,981 --> 00:40:22,120
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

786
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,240
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

787
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,660
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

788
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,600
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

789
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:40,319
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

791
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,140
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

792
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,260
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
