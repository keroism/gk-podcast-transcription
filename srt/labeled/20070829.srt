Scott: Okay, and it was one of those.

8
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,154
Scott: what variety of beggar was it?

9
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:39,619
Scott: because you know there are many different types.

10
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:47,320
Rym: It was a kind of beggar that I've never really encountered before because he he took several different types of beggar and kind of molded them together.

11
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:51,098
Scott: so he was a sort of like a.

12
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:53,091
Rym: He was a million beggar.

13
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:54,439
Rym: He was a multi-classed beggar.

14
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:59,096
Rym: He had like three different beggars all shoved into one all right for one.

15
00:00:59,257 --> 00:01:00,120
Rym: He was a crazy beggar.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,575
Rym: Yeah, crazy going for him, okay, but for two he had the.

17
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:07,589
Rym: get mad at you If you don't give him money or ignore him.

18
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:08,976
Rym: hey, I'm talking to you.

19
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:11,108
Rym: Yeah, you sir Hey, don't don't ignore me.

20
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:11,611
Rym: get over here.

21
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:11,933
Rym: Hey.

22
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:14,442
Rym: Yeah, get over here asshole Uh-huh.

23
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:18,459
Rym: and three he was going after people who were driving by.

24
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,245
Scott: Okay,

25
00:01:21,386 --> 00:01:33,145
Rym: so he's like I'm driving up and I see this guy in the middle of the street just kind of yelling at cars and going up to him and every now and then someone stops and he kind of leans in their window and then they kind of drive away and I Get up there and keep

26
00:01:33,165 --> 00:01:34,073
Scott: your window closed.

27
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:34,779
Rym: It's hot.

28
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:35,764
Rym: I got my window open.

29
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:41,251
Rym: I stopped at the stop sign and the old man comes over and he yells like hey So I look at him for a second thinking all right.

30
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:42,276
Rym: Maybe this guy needs something.

31
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:43,100
Rym: I don't know what's going on.

32
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:44,685
Rym: I didn't think he was a beggar.

33
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:47,032
Rym: I thought all right this guy might need help whatever.

34
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:48,496
Rym: and he yells.

35
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:49,600
Rym: Give me some change.

36
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:59,357
Rym: So I think oh, okay that answers that and I turn to the right and I Start to drive through the stop sign and then he yells no don't ignore me get over here.

37
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:00,060
Rym: I know you got money.

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,735
Scott: Yeah, I'm still gonna ignore you now.

39
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:03,936
Rym: now.

40
00:02:03,977 --> 00:02:04,400
Rym: Here's the trick.

41
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,812
Rym: I was about to park on the street like right there.

42
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:11,700
Scott: Ah, so just keep going but there's nowhere else to park.

43
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,088
Rym: So so I pull into it.

44
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:17,060
Rym: there's one spot left, you know, this is a part of the Bronx.

45
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,385
Rym: There's no goddamn parking.

46
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,400
Rym: So I pull into a spot like maybe 50 feet away from him.

47
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,320
Rym: Luckily, he's engaged in yelling at some other car at this time.

48
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,676
Rym: All right, but I'm in my car and the engines run him in this spot and I'm thinking if I leave is he gonna pee on my car?

49
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:32,609
Rym: What should I do?

50
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:34,925
Rym: I Gotta go do work.

51
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:36,111
Scott: Chances are not zero.

52
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:37,780
Rym: I was kind of worried about this.

53
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,260
Scott: I eventually just your work should ensure you against that sort of thing.

54
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,248
Rym: No work is gonna ensure you against that sort of.

55
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,738
Scott: they make you drive around the Bronx and deal with these people.

56
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:49,646
Rym: then I Just drove somewhere else.

57
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:53,119
Scott: I'm not a fan of insurance, but I would buy crazy bum insurance.

58
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,286
Rym: So I drove like two blocks away.

59
00:02:56,306 --> 00:03:06,195
Rym: then I stopped it a really shitty scuzzy looking Chinese place But it was actually pretty good Chinese food But the secret poison sauce in me, but it was good.

60
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:06,818
Rym: It was pretty good.

61
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:07,220
Rym: I ate it.

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,209
Rym: I had a shrimp roll.

63
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,500
Rym: It was it was acceptable.

64
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:13,676
Rym: Hey And the bum didn't find my car because it didn't look like anyone had peed on it.

65
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:19,920
Rym: when I got back Did it smell like being not any more so than my car does just from being in certain parts of you?

66
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:21,465
Rym: Well that too.

67
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:33,420
Rym: Yeah, you know, I only attempted that once on a long road trip and all I want to say is My don't pee your pants reflex is a lot stronger than my pee into a jug attempts.

68
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:39,360
Rym: So my brain said just peeing it then I don't have to pull over and the body said I'm not in a bathroom.

69
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:45,869
Scott: One time I went to the doctor and you know you go to the doctor you get a urine and you know urine test You know to make sure you don't have problems.

70
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,160
Rym: I can only do that if I'm standing over a toilet.

71
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,025
Rym: I just got a whole no.

72
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,540
Scott: No, I can do it standing up even if there's no toilet.

73
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:52,865
Rym: One cuz I'll feel.

74
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:56,900
Scott: they did the test and they said there's something funny, but it might not be anything serious.

75
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:59,880
Scott: What you have to do is you have to do the urine test as soon as you wake up.

76
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,287
Rym: I know exactly what that was.

77
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:07,760
Rym: They found protein in it maybe and they're like, alright You either were walking around a lot or you have kidney problems, right?

78
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,622
Scott: See you to do it as soon as you wake up in the morning before doing anything without even standing up and then they can Know.

79
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:24,080
Scott: so I had to lay down in bed sideways and pee into a cup and I just couldn't pee Laying down, you know, I because my don't wet the bed reflex is so strong strong reflex.

80
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:29,934
Rym: It is every now and then I've had those dreams for not so much lately But when I was a kid, especially where you know, I got a pee.

81
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:36,754
Rym: cuz you know in the real world Rims body that's laying there has to pee and in the dream I got a pee and I had to be pretty bad too.

82
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:39,360
Rym: and the brain smart It always just doesn't let you find a bathroom.

83
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:46,760
Rym: You know in your dream, you can't find a bathroom ever if you got a pee because your pains like alright I know what'll happen if I let him find a bathroom.

84
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:48,538
Rym: There's no bathrooms in this world.

85
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:55,492
Rym: But every now and then I'd will myself into a bathroom And then I just couldn't pee or even worse.

86
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:56,960
Rym: It'd be the Adam Sandler syndrome.

87
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,298
Rym: I'm peeing and peeing and peeing and peeing and peeing and peeing and peeing.

88
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:05,138
Rym: But I'm not getting any relief and it just keeps coming and eventually I wake up and I'm laying in bed.

89
00:05:05,178 --> 00:05:09,109
Rym: I'm like, oh I gotta go pee and then I get up and go pee.

90
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,220
Rym: Yeah, the brain's really clever about that.

91
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,015
Scott: I got to say well, you have to train it when you're a kid.

92
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:18,465
Scott: It's not so clever It's really kind of stupid.

93
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:21,236
Scott: Hey, I gotta be let's be right away.

94
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:22,340
Rym: Well, that is the natural state.

95
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:29,689
Scott: I think the problem is is that you know when you start out, you know, you're a little baby You just pee and then they give you a diaper.

96
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:33,160
Rym: So you keep just peeing and I didn't just keep the moment.

97
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,589
Rym: I remember the like one of my earliest memories.

98
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:42,193
Rym: I had a diaper on and I peed and then I thought ah I paid and I think that was the moment.

99
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:42,696
Rym: I attained.

100
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:45,907
Scott: sentience Sounds like a good time as any.

101
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:48,780
Rym: well you had your moment when you realized the lines.

102
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,760
Scott: Well, cuz people always said, you know color in the lines.

103
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:56,153
Scott: I remember people saying color in the lines and I didn't really like.

104
00:05:56,454 --> 00:06:01,109
Rym: you took a crane and we're like scribble scribble scribble Yeah, I didn't really think about it or anything.

105
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,096
Scott: just people that was just something people said.

106
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:06,867
Scott: whenever I colored I didn't Understand that they were telling me to do something.

107
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:10,160
Scott: and then I remember it must have been like some kids birthday party or something.

108
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,958
Scott: and I was sitting there the coloring book and the crayons and I'm like, oh the lines.

109
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:21,275
Scott: And then I call it in the lines and I kind of want a coloring book.

110
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:29,240
Rym: all of a sudden, you know There's gotta be some coloring books, you know, if no one's made him, I think we should make him some sort of Cthulhu coloring book.

111
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:30,345
Scott: I'm sure it exists.

112
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:31,329
Scott: Let me search for it right?

113
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:32,394
Rym: Yeah while you search for that.

114
00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:33,680
Scott: I've actually seen it before.

115
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:40,611
Rym: So, uh speaking of kids and being kids There's some pretty bad news in the anime world.

116
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:48,800
Rym: like every now and then there's something happens Like, you know a famous animator dies or a great show gets cancelled and you just gotta have the moment of silence.

117
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:54,680
Rym: It is as if all of the good taste on the internet was suddenly silenced.

118
00:06:55,202 --> 00:06:56,947
Scott: Oh, but there is no good taste on the internet.

119
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:58,592
Rym: So nothing about the good parts of the internet.

120
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:04,251
Rym: So basically our forums and Like some parts of slash shot.

121
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:04,795
Scott: Yeah.

122
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:05,700
Scott: All right, right.

123
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:12,178
Rym: So, uh, they're making a second gunslinger girl and it's gonna air in the spring.

124
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,468
Rym: now I don't know if you're familiar with gunslinger.

125
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:16,015
Scott: It's not the worst show.

126
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:17,000
Scott: nice pretty bad.

127
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:26,700
Rym: it's not the worst show because the worst show is the show that we're gonna do a show on at some point because Anime world order and fast karate think they're all cool talking about like demon city or angel cop.

128
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,053
Rym: But there's a show they've never talked about and we're gonna talk about it.

129
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:31,916
Scott: It's real.

130
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,180
Scott: Oh you we should talk about it today.

131
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:34,726
Rym: No, because I want to do the thing.

132
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,453
Rym: I want to watch the show again.

133
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:38,020
Scott: I don't know if I want to waste my time.

134
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,702
Rym: Here's the reason.

135
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:50,657
Rym: if you talk about a show like this and you don't give like all the pertinent details of the show and Kind of take people through the plot semi chronologically They're gonna be curious and they're gonna watch the show and that's a bad idea.

136
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:51,220
Scott: That's true.

137
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,104
Rym: You got to take.

138
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:53,430
Rym: give them enough info to where.

139
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,246
Rym: not only do they get how bad the show is But they no longer need to watch.

140
00:07:57,326 --> 00:07:58,550
Rym: the curiosity is sated.

141
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,360
Rym: Yeah, I would not inflict this show upon anyone.

142
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:02,366
Scott: I don't know.

143
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:04,680
Scott: Maybe that could be fun to inflict the show upon everyone.

144
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,776
Rym: If that were the case I'd review it like.

145
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:07,360
Rym: it's awesome.

146
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:09,800
Rym: Oh my god starts out really bad.

147
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:13,840
Rym: But then the last 20 minutes make up a story like they ran out of money.

148
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:14,909
Rym: So they just went crazy.

149
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:17,465
Rym: go nuts and it's super awesome And you just gotta wait for it.

150
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,831
Scott: too bad in the anime.

151
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:19,896
Scott: That's the last second.

152
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:21,483
Scott: It's the worst thing ever I know.

153
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,447
Rym: I mean the show.

154
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:29,394
Rym: she's going downhill downhill and then we get our ID It's the end and then it goes off a cliff if that's possible.

155
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,313
Scott: It's so far underground I don't know how but I guess they come out the other side of the world.

156
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,200
Scott: No, that would be better.

157
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:39,679
Rym: It's kind of like I'm Caesar and I've already been stabbed and I'm laying on the ground slowly bleeding to death.

158
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,275
Scott: No, you're laying on the ground already dead and it still gets worse.

159
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,144
Scott: Yeah You're already in hell.

160
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:48,240
Scott: if there is a hell doing the worst thing possible and it still gets worse at the end.

161
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,287
Rym: All right, right.

162
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:56,789
Rym: So, uh gunslinger girls is basically Pedophile moe bullshit plus gun porn.

163
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:57,270
Rym: Yep.

164
00:08:57,491 --> 00:08:57,913
Rym: Now that wouldn't.

165
00:08:57,993 --> 00:08:59,980
Rym: I mean it could have been a good show.

166
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:05,884
Rym: You could have taken this concept and made a really creepy really Scary show.

167
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:08,838
Rym: but no that's not my gripe because you can make a show like this.

168
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:20,400
Rym: But despite the fact that they spent all this money on the show and they made it the kind of show that it is It's really shittily done and the director just didn't know what he was doing and it was slow and the gunfights were crap.

169
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:21,784
Rym: You'd think all right.

170
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:27,120
Rym: I'm gonna get to see a nine-year-old girl take a p90 and kill like a thousand gangsters.

171
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:28,827
Rym: How could that not be awesome?

172
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:32,160
Rym: Well gunslinger girls found a way fuck that show.

173
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,310
Scott: The fact I've only watched one episode of it.

174
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,958
Rym: I watched all of it.

175
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:38,994
Rym: Wow Don't watch that show.

176
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:49,540
Rym: the moment There's a moment when I decided I wasn't gonna watch the rest of it and the only thing that made me watch the rest of it was the fact that I didn't have an internet connection and I was really bored and my cell phone didn't work.

177
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:56,919
Rym: So I was living in the mountains and I'd already read every book I had and I already beaten half-life 1 again And I've already beaten XCOM again.

178
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,720
Scott: I've noticed this trend lately that a lot more anime shows are getting second and third seasons than they were previously.

179
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,864
Scott: I mean few.

180
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:09,298
Scott: just years ago like less than a decade ago shows were getting cut to 13 episodes.

181
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,209
Scott: You know not getting their full 26.

182
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,880
Scott: Yeah Of course that happened back in the day.

183
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,666
Scott: Episode shows are getting cut to 26.

184
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,720
Rym: how many of the great shows from back in the day were originally 39 and got cut back?

185
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,362
Rym: Well, that's

186
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:36,820
Scott: that's part of what I like so much about anime at least television anime was that they're all limited series usually 26 episodes that you could digest pretty quickly and if they keep coming out with multiple seasons of all these stupid shows I just don't know if I'm up to watching them no matter how good they are.

187
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:38,744
Scott: I mean That's a major reason.

188
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:46,969
Scott: I don't watch things like Naruto and bleach despite not liking them because all the fighting is just too many goddamn Episodes, you know, it's 39 or less.

189
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,100
Scott: I mean Gundam seed was 50 and that was still a little too much.

190
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,031
Rym: Right, I don't have any more to say about this.

191
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:56,964
Rym: if you haven't seen gunslinger girls Don't watch it.

192
00:10:57,044 --> 00:10:57,967
Rym: It's not cool.

193
00:10:58,268 --> 00:10:59,532
Rym: Not even an ironic sense.

194
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:02,140
Rym: It's just there was nothing redeeming about it.

195
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,214
Rym: It is not interesting in any way and the end is just.

196
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:08,725
Rym: I don't want to get into it All right.

197
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:20,593
Scott: So this news might seem Counterintuitive to a rant I had in recent weeks about this kind of news But I am not concentrating on the aspects of this news.

198
00:11:20,673 --> 00:11:21,175
Rym: hypocrite.

199
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:23,202
Rym: Yeah hypocrite That's it.

200
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:24,869
Rym: we're past that Scott's hypocrite.

201
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:25,432
Rym: get on with it.

202
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,440
Scott: All right, so the headline of this story?

203
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,193
Scott: Well, it's talking about the speed racer movie that the matrix guys are making.

204
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:35,343
Scott: Oh, I think I know tricks guy and transsexual.

205
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:47,360
Scott: I think I know what you're gonna talk about because I have that article open and it was almost my news and this Actual article is like an interview with Susan Sarandon who's gonna be in the movie or I guess Tommy Lee Jones is giving the interview.

206
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,143
Scott: I don't know.

207
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:49,307
Scott: It doesn't matter.

208
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:59,480
Scott: The point is is that in this little article here They they talk about that in the speed race or live-action movie that they are making that I naturally have low expectations for.

209
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:11,379
Scott: they're going to have a camera in which everything that the camera sees is in focus much like an animation where everything is in focus all the time.

210
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:22,500
Scott: and That gives me a tiny speck of hope that hey, they're gonna make it a live-action speed racer But they're gonna make it definitely in the style of the animation.

211
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:28,557
Rym: So really really choppy and hard to follow and everything off model all the time.

212
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:29,780
Rym: That's exactly what I want.

213
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:35,759
Rym: It's really hard to go off model with actors I guess unless you.

214
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:39,796
Scott: The thing is they gotta have the monkey they need the monkey or else bits.

215
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:40,318
Scott: It's worth it.

216
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:40,860
Scott: It's worthless.

217
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,039
Scott: There's no point without the monkey.

218
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:50,939
Rym: You know, it would make it great if they just got some untrained non-circus non-film monkey And it was just always there causing trouble in the pit.

219
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:57,522
Scott: It was just monkey loose in the pits just constantly and then like the monkey would get into the other people's cars and this Avotage them.

220
00:12:57,563 --> 00:12:58,747
Scott: but it wouldn't be purposeful.

221
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:02,219
Scott: It would just be random act of monkey does nothing about poop and mall people.

222
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:14,928
Scott: Yeah, if you made like the speed racer movie in the style of the original speed racer But like with this dose of parody reality in there That could be actually really good.

223
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:15,791
Rym: I'd watch that.

224
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:17,960
Rym: Yeah, I wish they do that with a lot of things.

225
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,444
Rym: I mean we talked about it before.

226
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:23,176
Rym: remember the live-action initial d-movie and how much it sucked sucked ass.

227
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:23,797
Rym: Yeah.

228
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:26,612
Rym: Yeah Oh, I got nothing else to say about that.

229
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:32,071
Scott: No, but I'm looking forward to the trailers for this movie just to see what it looks like.

230
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:35,100
Rym: That's a pretty strong endorsement from the Scotty.

231
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:45,350
Rym: There you go Things of the day.

232
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:54,035
Rym: so as you all know I'm a big fan of pranks and this prank Was very near and dear to me because I attempted something similar as a child in high school.

233
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:55,219
Rym: that didn't quite go.

234
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,650
Scott: so well Oh, he didn't succeed the way these people did.

235
00:13:57,932 --> 00:14:00,484
Rym: Oh, not at all, but I had the idea I was thwarted.

236
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:01,166
Rym: but I'll get to that.

237
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:06,880
Rym: basically these kids there's a crosswalk, you know, and I don't know what state it was And I didn't read or pay attention to anything.

238
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,776
Rym: But in a lot of states in the US if there's a marked crosswalk by law.

239
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:15,619
Rym: if it's uncontrolled Pedestrians have the right-of-way no matter what.

240
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:19,000
Rym: Yep, as long as they're within the boundaries of the crosswalk.

241
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:30,136
Scott: Usually they only put crosswalks like this that are uncontrolled, you know in places where there isn't a great deal of pedestrian traffic If there's a lot of pedestrian traffic, they usually have you know lights that say okay cars go.

242
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:30,899
Scott: Okay, people go.

243
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:40,236
Rym: Okay Okay, people go but this one place they often put them is right in front of schools because there's a bunch of pedestrian traffic all At once when the kids need to go and other than that, there's nothing.

244
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:44,858
Scott: Yep So why have lights there all the time for go and not go and really only have kids there?

245
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:48,960
Scott: in the morning Everyone stops and then at night everyone, you know, everyone goes again.

246
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:57,460
Rym: Well these juniors Realized that there was a tunnel or something going underneath the street between these two buildings and the crosswalk went across between the two buildings.

247
00:14:58,302 --> 00:15:09,740
Rym: So they got a whole bunch of people together and at a specified time in a semi single file kind of casual line People just started crossing the street and they didn't stop ever.

248
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:17,320
Rym: And cars started backing up and the speed was just blocked and it just keeps going and go.

249
00:15:18,281 --> 00:15:22,112
Scott: Yeah, while they may not seem illegal, you know, we're just crossing the crosswalk.

250
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:41,295
Scott: if they do discover which will be pretty obvious You know when they see the guy in the cow costume walk by more than once and the chicken costume walk by more than once They'll realize that you are blocking traffic on purpose, you know in an organized and intended way Which is as illegal as say parking on the sidewalk,

251
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,646
Rym: but regardless of that It's quite hilarious.

252
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:44,872
Rym: and I give these kids props.

253
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:45,937
Scott: Oh, it's super hilarious.

254
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:46,640
Scott: This is an awesome prank.

255
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,318
Rym: I give these kids props for the very hilarious and non-destructive prank.

256
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:58,799
Rym: Yep Now when I was in high school I was a member of the Ford to Falcon marching band and we fielded over 200 people at one point.

257
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:18,620
Rym: so Partly because we were gigantic jerks whenever we marched to a parade ground like two for a competition from the staging area we would often do it single file partly because it was kind of intimidating to the other competition bands when We would march by for like five solid minutes because we were twice as big as all of them.

258
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:23,541
Rym: So one day we're marching out of the school in a little break room We had.

259
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:40,480
Rym: we're marching down to a parade ground for a practice and we're going past all these bands and I realized and I was Pretty sure that if we had just taken the front of the band and looped it around through the school We could have made a never-ending loop passing this band that was a particularly a bad rival of ours

260
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:41,624
Scott: Uh-huh.

261
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:45,920
Rym: So and of course, there are all these other people in some minor local reporters around.

262
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:52,275
Rym: So we thought it'd be really cool If the band just kept walking past in the background and all this reporter stuff and all these people.

263
00:16:52,316 --> 00:16:53,560
Rym: and I was down with this.

264
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,264
Rym: So I go up to mr.

265
00:16:55,284 --> 00:17:03,659
Rym: Knitter house the somewhat ornery band director and I explain or attempt to explain my plan to him and He just kind of stares at me.

266
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,075
Rym: He doesn't react at all doesn't even raise an eyebrow and just stares at me.

267
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:17,393
Rym: and I'm talking, you know well what we got to do is get the front part of the band right and get him to come around like this and meet up With the back half and then we get the drummers to go ahead but not go past the second time otherwise, they'll catch on.

268
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:22,670
Rym: and And finally I stopped and I'm like, so what do you think?

269
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:29,357
Rym: and he just looks at me and then he just kind of says You know, you don't really like living on this planet very much.

270
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:29,679
Rym: Do you?

271
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:31,533
Rym: Get back in line.

272
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:34,226
Scott: Oh I was spoils for it.

273
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:35,290
Rym: I was sad.

274
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,999
Rym: I really think we could have done it and I would have been very happy with that.

275
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:49,000
Scott: Oh So my thing today when I was a kid There were these movies that called gremlins and then gremlins 2 and I never saw gremlins 1 actually, but I saw.

276
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:52,887
Scott: One is great I know but I saw gremlins 2 in the movie theater.

277
00:17:52,947 --> 00:18:05,220
Scott: and the premise of these movies that there's this cute furball thing and If it gets wet between a certain amount of time or if it eats at the wrong times during the time You don't remember at all.

278
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,949
Scott: All right, something like so like after midnight or something.

279
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:15,347
Rym: if you get the little cute fuzzy creature wet He spawns like five or six more little gremlins But they're also really cute.

280
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:23,080
Rym: and if you let him eat meat after midnight They turn into horrible evil deadly things that go around killing old ladies, right?

281
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,531
Rym: Now I always wondered you can't feed a meat after midnight, right?

282
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,037
Scott: So when can you feed him again?

283
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:29,060
Rym: Yeah, what's the deadline?

284
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,366
Scott: I mean they never explained that.

285
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:34,046
Rym: is it from midnight on is just once it hits midnight They can never eat meat again.

286
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:38,246
Rym: that that pissed me off as a kid and to this day Pissed me off as a kid.

287
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:38,809
Scott: It's like okay.

288
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,866
Scott: So after midnight well 1159 p.m.

289
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:45,277
Scott: Is after midnight of the previous day.

290
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:46,282
Rym: also How come?

291
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:50,299
Rym: the main character gremlin is really nice and doesn't do all the bad things, but everyone else does.

292
00:18:50,903 --> 00:19:06,440
Scott: Yeah, it made no sense to me but gremlins 2 was actually a comedic parody movie that was not quite the same as gremlins 1 but still kind of the same and I Saw it as a kid in the theaters and it was pretty funny and I like it even though it's not the greatest movie ever.

293
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:26,013
Scott: The point is that in the middle of the movie at some point It was sort of this fake intermission thing that involved Hulk Hogan Hulkamania yeah, and When they put this movie out on VHS slash DVD whatever the scene with Hulk Hogan and the fake intermission was removed.

294
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,979
Scott: for who knows what reason we don't know.

295
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,940
Scott: and Here is that scene on YouTube?

296
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:40,249
Scott: So if you're watching the gremlins 2 which you probably should sometime in your life and also the one Here's the missing scene from the second one.

297
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,157
Rym: You know when I was a kid with Hulk Hogan.

298
00:19:42,318 --> 00:19:44,877
Scott: Oh, yeah Wait, that's Randy Randy Savage that goes.

299
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:53,252
Rym: Oh, yeah Yeah I had the audio drama of gremlins on a little record that I played That I played on my Big Bird record player.

300
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,496
Scott: I had a Big Bird record player.

301
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:55,400
Rym: I think everyone did.

302
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:57,849
Scott: Oh, yeah, that was the best turntable ever had now.

303
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,659
Rym: I know that Hulk Hogan gives the gremlins the double-deuce.

304
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,489
Rym: It's funny cuz Scott's sitting there.

305
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:03,811
Rym: He's like.

306
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:05,260
Rym: he sends me the video so I watch it.

307
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:08,391
Rym: I'm laughing But then I just keep watching it like this one part.

308
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:10,844
Rym: over and over and over and over again Scott's like what the fuck you doing?

309
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,091
Rym: I Was pretty sure he flipped the gremlins off, but I couldn't tell.

310
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:17,540
Rym: and it's really hard to go frame by frame in a YouTube.

311
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:18,719
Scott: Yeah, it is.

312
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:25,640
Scott: But it does appear that Hulk Hogan gives two middle fingers to the gremlins that are off-screen.

313
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:33,787
Rym: I got to the exact frame and unless it's just really blurry and he's actually just kind of pointing at him I'm pretty sure that he flipped him off.

314
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:35,332
Scott: It is a good 75/25 chance.

315
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:36,175
Scott: He is flipping them off.

316
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,900
Rym: I'm proud of the fact that I found that out that I wasted a good part of my day.

317
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:52,343
Rym: Not a good part, but actually yeah If you take my commute and everything into consideration a good part of the free time I have I spent trying to figure out if Hulk Hogan flipped off some gremlins in a special feature in a movie that was never Put on a DVD.

318
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,568
Scott: doesn't matter Hulk Hogan.

319
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:55,053
Scott: Awesome gremlins.

320
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:56,278
Scott: Awesome video.

321
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:56,800
Scott: Awesome.

322
00:20:57,281 --> 00:21:15,433
Rym: So apparently in the future of all the human achievements of all the sports of all the games Of all the culture of all the art The thing that spreads across the universe the thing that humans bring to the collective intelligence of all known I almost said creation because that's a poetic word but intergalactic.

323
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:19,274
Rym: I don't want to use that word entertainment Whatever, I don't know.

324
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:23,080
Rym: apparently Basketball is the thing that we bring to the universe.

325
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:33,702
Scott: Oh, you think of all the art and all the things that we've created the one that would catch on through all intelligent species podcasting would be Podcasting.

326
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:36,029
Rym: yeah basketball now, not only that.

327
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:43,627
Rym: but turns out that in all the universe there are in fact species of Animals, well, maybe not speech.

328
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:46,056
Scott: Well, they're an alien species alien races.

329
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:49,289
Scott: I'd say there's a Humanoid alien race.

330
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,940
Rym: Well, I mean, I wouldn't say that to be humanoid.

331
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:53,059
Rym: I mean odds are out there.

332
00:21:53,421 --> 00:21:58,820
Rym: There is some form of being that would be better at basketball than us humans.

333
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:04,067
Rym: Maybe some sort of psychic blob that just moves the ball with its mental powers?

334
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:10,473
Rym: or maybe just a Giant stick that just puts the ball on top of itself and then slams it every time.

335
00:22:10,734 --> 00:22:13,684
Scott: maybe a race of living basketballs.

336
00:22:13,724 --> 00:22:15,713
Scott: they confuse you and put themselves in the net.

337
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:17,340
Rym: but no apparently.

338
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:21,780
Rym: First all the aliens and all the multiverse are humanoid.

339
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:26,660
Rym: They're just different colors like green or purple and they have horns.

340
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:27,764
Scott: They're otherwise.

341
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:31,300
Scott: only one species of them has horns the Goran.

342
00:22:31,581 --> 00:22:33,829
Rym: But they didn't show us any other alien species.

343
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:37,978
Rym: so I can assume that that is the only species of alien in the universe except for humans.

344
00:22:38,341 --> 00:22:45,527
Scott: So as humans and Goran's and Goran's are way better at basketball than human It must be those horns.

345
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,477
Rym: I don't know that green skin.

346
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:50,413
Scott: apparently They're not so much better that humans can't.

347
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:51,680
Scott: can you know can still score?

348
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:57,377
Rym: They're just like 12 feet tall and twice as fast yeah, but they're not so much better.

349
00:22:57,397 --> 00:22:58,500
Scott: the humans can't score at all.

350
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,323
Scott: They're just so much better.

351
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:04,620
Scott: the humans can't win and apparently they don't cheat or kick you while you're down or anything evil like that.

352
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:13,773
Rym: They're just way better and evil looking but not evil at heart though up in the minor leagues One of the teams that was the champion has a really evil looking coach.

353
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:15,620
Scott: It does it does yeah.

354
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,731
Rym: So we're talking about some shit.

355
00:23:17,852 --> 00:23:18,878
Rym: anime that we watched.

356
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,166
Scott: well We didn't have any.

357
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:21,899
Scott: well Rym again did not read a comic.

358
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:32,565
Rym: And well because we cancelled last week when I was gonna do read a comic and this week I thought I'm gonna read that Batman comic that katsu head out, and I don't know where he put it And I didn't put any effort.

359
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:33,146
Rym: Oh, well.

360
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:34,049
Rym: I didn't look in there.

361
00:23:34,591 --> 00:23:36,317
Scott: He left it down where the comics are.

362
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:37,340
Rym: he left it downstairs.

363
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:38,484
Rym: I figured I'd still be there.

364
00:23:38,806 --> 00:23:39,669
Rym: you put something away.

365
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:41,557
Rym: I put wait wait wait a minute.

366
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:42,420
Rym: you put something away.

367
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:46,620
Scott: I think the problem here is that I put shit away all the time, and you seem to think I don't put shit away.

368
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,450
Rym: Well you don't put your shoes away every day shoes.

369
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,715
Scott: I use them constantly.

370
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:51,980
Rym: No you don't you leave them.

371
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,207
Scott: Every day I use them.

372
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:57,930
Rym: Scott leaves his shoes sprawled out Directly in front of the front door where I have to walk.

373
00:23:58,372 --> 00:23:59,235
Scott: I come in the house.

374
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:02,209
Rym: I take them off Yeah, and you leave them there.

375
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:02,993
Rym: You don't put them away.

376
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:03,335
Rym: Well.

377
00:24:03,435 --> 00:24:04,340
Scott: What am I gonna put them?

378
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,400
Scott: I'm using them again real soon, but with all I wasn't gonna use my shoes like my dress shoes.

379
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:11,288
Scott: They're away cuz you know what I don't use them.

380
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:14,400
Rym: you have several pairs of shoes laying around downstairs.

381
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:16,531
Rym: They're only away because I put them away.

382
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:17,415
Scott: whatever.

383
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:24,120
Rym: anyway This shit anime called buzzer beaters or buzzer beaters.

384
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:30,800
Scott: Yeah, I had watched this show previously And I went downstairs to look and see what anime we had to watch you know because we needed to watch something quick.

385
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:40,539
Scott: There just be an episode that we can make a show about and we wanted Something kind of recent and I saw this in the bin, and I said well, that's terrible, but we can talk about it.

386
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,939
Rym: So uh everything we said just before we brought this up.

387
00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:46,646
Rym: That's the plot.

388
00:24:46,707 --> 00:24:51,887
Rym: basically the gore ends are better than humans at basketball But the humans got to show them up.

389
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:53,031
Rym: let their homies know who done it.

390
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:56,282
Scott: so the humans make an earth team of the best Players on earth.

391
00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:57,546
Rym: no they don't they?

392
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:08,105
Rym: there's a montage where it's like check it out a quick shot of all the Not so great players on earth because they're all really stupid and divisive And they argue with each other.

393
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:11,257
Rym: and then the main character the show is like the shittiest of all of them.

394
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:12,180
Scott: the main character.

395
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,897
Scott: The show is like Edward Elric only he's annoying all the time instead of occasionally not being you know.

396
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:23,096
Rym: imagine if you take you know Full metal alchemist if Edward Elric, and he goes into that who are you calling short?

397
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:23,699
Rym: I'm not sure.

398
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:25,459
Rym: you're sure I'm gonna kick your ass bla bla bla bla.

399
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,419
Rym: Who you calling a bean sprout and you just leave him in that mode for the entire show and not only that.

400
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:34,055
Scott: but he's so immature like like.

401
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:37,236
Scott: I've never seen someone so immature.

402
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:43,300
Scott: I mean Usually when you have a a show like a sports show especially like a basketball show.

403
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,991
Scott: What's the obvious thing in a basketball show?

404
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,060
Scott: for there to be drama you don't pass me the ball?

405
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:48,938
Scott: I'm a ball hog.

406
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:55,477
Scott: That's the obvious immature crap that good sports anime and manga just go beyond.

407
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:57,065
Scott: like initial D Doesn't get the.

408
00:25:57,468 --> 00:25:59,000
Scott: oh you crashed into me crap.

409
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:03,020
Scott: I mean well once once, but it doesn't do it in that immature way.

410
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:03,682
Rym: No, it does.

411
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:07,335
Scott: It's just this show goes down to the lowest common denominator.

412
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:08,580
Rym: You don't pass me the ball.

413
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,828
Scott: Hey, why'd you pass me the ball, and I hate you.

414
00:26:10,848 --> 00:26:13,236
Scott: you suck screw this earth team now.

415
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:19,165
Rym: beyond that I would like to note that the animation is It's it's.

416
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:21,018
Rym: it's a little better than size.

417
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:21,320
Rym: and Joe.

418
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:27,882
Scott: well the thing is the animation is deceptive and that the actual colors are bright and The.

419
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:34,509
Scott: the way things are done with CG everything looks really shiny and new But kind of like Ziza and Jotaro.

420
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:37,300
Rym: no no you look at it still and you think it looks awesome.

421
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,026
Rym: You look at it still.

422
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:38,671
Rym: It's like wow.

423
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:39,800
Rym: That's really cool.

424
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,215
Scott: You know the style of art is sort of like this weird muscliness But it actually is sort of a basketball muscliness, so yeah kind of makes sense.

425
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:57,520
Scott: and when they play basketball They do this weird thing where they have 2d Basketball players right and normal anime on top of this big CG 3d basketball court that sort of bounces up and down.

426
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,505
Rym: It almost looks like they kind of Protoscoped it or something.

427
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,408
Scott: it looks like you're.

428
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:09,461
Scott: it looks like you're playing a basketball video game where the camera is going all over the place except it there's not a lot of good continuity between Like.

429
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:13,194
Rym: they'll show like up zooming in shaky cam whatever and it shows like a move.

430
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:19,860
Rym: or one guy passes the ball to another guy Who tries to do a layup, but all the individual scenes don't really link up into a contiguous game?

431
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,178
Scott: Well, I think the thing is they didn't show us a basketball game Which is what I want in a sports anime.

432
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:30,288
Scott: I want to see the sport itself unfold and the drama of even when they were playing basketball They started with.

433
00:27:30,328 --> 00:27:31,136
Rym: they started a game.

434
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:37,560
Rym: Game lasted like 30 seconds, but even when the game was going the they don't really show basketball.

435
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:49,295
Rym: They show these kind of oddly animated jerky Someone's playing basketball over there And then it cuts to a still of all these people watching and then they cover up their mouths.

436
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,322
Rym: don't have to animate their mouths moving This show.

437
00:27:51,342 --> 00:27:55,980
Scott: if you actually pay attention to what's going on they avoid animating mouths at all costs.

438
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,280
Scott: They don't show you anything.

439
00:27:57,421 --> 00:28:02,060
Scott: They will show you the character who is being talked to so they don't have to draw the character talking.

440
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,687
Rym: It's like I started to anticipate.

441
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:06,680
Rym: it's like alright that character is about to talk.

442
00:28:07,162 --> 00:28:15,371
Rym: I'll bet as soon as they start to talk it's gonna cut to the reaction shot and sure enough And they'll show freaking the backs of characters.

443
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:18,360
Scott: They'll have characters think to themselves to avoid having them talk.

444
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,750
Rym: There's a lot of top-down so they don't have to show my have people like.

445
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:25,020
Scott: they'll have characters narrate other characters playing basketball.

446
00:28:26,262 --> 00:28:29,260
Scott: Love characters go as D and start screaming so they want to animate the mouth.

447
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:33,319
Scott: They do every trick in the book to avoid animating as much as possible.

448
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:34,807
Rym: now Yeah, it's even worse than that.

449
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:41,620
Rym: almost every shot outside the basketball Which is 90% of this show is you know when an anime when they're cutting corners?

450
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:54,900
Rym: It'll be like moving moving moving and suddenly an entire character locks into a rigid Obviously not changing cell or not changing like set or pose and then like just one arm is animated.

451
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:55,886
Rym: It looks really weird.

452
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:57,959
Rym: the show does that all the time.

453
00:28:58,543 --> 00:29:06,500
Scott: Yeah, like there's a time when a character is standing there But their arms and the basketball are moving and nothing else and it they stay at that for like at least 10 seconds.

454
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:09,960
Rym: It's kind of weird and even it just keeps getting worse.

455
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,326
Rym: There's so many you know what.

456
00:29:11,387 --> 00:29:14,260
Rym: sometimes you pan across the scene for dramatic effect or whatever.

457
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:22,268
Rym: This show pans like every single shot to try to distract you from the fact that it's just a still That they're all just stills.

458
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:24,419
Rym: the show is just stills pretty much.

459
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:27,271
Rym: It's even worse than that.

460
00:29:29,222 --> 00:29:31,230
Rym: The characters don't stay on model at all.

461
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:33,619
Rym: I have no idea how tall the main character is.

462
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,836
Rym: sometimes She's like eight feet tall.

463
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,145
Rym: sometimes He's like four feet tall.

464
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:46,157
Scott: hard to tell how old he is too because he's SD a lot And then he'll suddenly be sort of non SD, and then it he'll be shorter and taller and and wider.

465
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:51,537
Scott: and God it sometimes will be better basketball than is at other times, and I don't fucking know.

466
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:57,440
Rym: so The character designs are muscly and weird, but they kind of fit the sports anime whatever.

467
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:10,889
Rym: So I'm not really gonna complain about that though a lot of shots and a lot of angles the muscles look Broken like muscles that should be there aren't and muscles that shouldn't be there Just kind of hanging on and limbs move in ways that they shouldn't move.

468
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,991
Scott: And it's like whoa did your shoulder just detach what the hell?

469
00:30:17,091 --> 00:30:19,360
Rym: and people's arms are just way too long.

470
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:27,510
Scott: Yeah, I guess that's part of basketball those you need the really long arms that you can animate the basketball maneuvers It's just.

471
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:27,934
Scott: ah.

472
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:40,877
Scott: so regardless of the terrible animation buzzer beater has a show I Guess supposed to be about basketball and it's based on a manga called buzzer beater Which is by the same guy who did the manga called slam dunk.

473
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:41,118
Scott: now I?

474
00:30:42,483 --> 00:30:51,200
Scott: Was previously under the impression that since slam dunk is a famous Basketball manga that is popular all around the world except in the US that it was good.

475
00:30:52,242 --> 00:31:03,460
Scott: I had done some research and checked with some sources And I can say slam dunk is not good slam dunk is terrible and buzzer beater is Sort of more slam dunk with aliens by the same guy.

476
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:10,649
Rym: I keep forgetting that when I'm talking about it that it's about fucking aliens with horns And there's the one ring guy if it's.

477
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:13,177
Scott: if it's worse than slam dunk it five that's possible.

478
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:14,120
Rym: There's the one.

479
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,306
Rym: There's one cool alien.

480
00:31:15,768 --> 00:31:16,733
Rym: He's green.

481
00:31:16,873 --> 00:31:18,240
Scott: He's got horns and a fro.

482
00:31:19,363 --> 00:31:20,009
Rym: That's the best care.

483
00:31:20,332 --> 00:31:25,474
Rym: now all right There is one good scene in this entire first episode of this show.

484
00:31:25,494 --> 00:31:27,841
Scott: is it the same the same scene that I thought was the Good scene?

485
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:28,483
Rym: well for me.

486
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:35,519
Rym: It's the guy who the guy named zucchini who's like the paparazzi that one and The characters just crap.

487
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:40,740
Rym: But he pulls out his business card and the business card has this like logo of him.

488
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:43,812
Rym: And if I were that guy that would be my business card.

489
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:48,119
Rym: if if I looked like that at all That would be the logo for GeekNights.

490
00:31:48,786 --> 00:31:49,979
Rym: It's it's perfect.

491
00:31:50,825 --> 00:32:00,000
Scott: My favorite scene was when one of the players walks On the earth team walks is walking down the hallway, and he there's a bin of fan mail And he looks at it and all right.

492
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:05,075
Scott: And he picks up this one letter completely randomly and completely unrelated to everything else in the episode.

493
00:32:05,516 --> 00:32:11,394
Scott: and the letter says you know I'm a kid who's in a Goron Goran slave can't you know?

494
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:12,457
Scott: I am a slave.

495
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:13,400
Scott: It's in English, too.

496
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,206
Scott: It's like I am slave of Goran.

497
00:32:15,547 --> 00:32:17,634
Scott: I pray for you to win at basketball.

498
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:19,520
Rym: It's a secret to everybody.

499
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:22,859
Scott: yeah, just and the guy is all like touched by this letter.

500
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:24,583
Scott: and Frickin make the show.

501
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:32,004
Scott: if you the show is about that kind of drama of you know the humans versus the Gorons and the Cool, they just.

502
00:32:32,305 --> 00:32:33,709
Rym: I mean there's a scene where the Gorons.

503
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,160
Rym: There's one with a couple of goils hanging out at a movie theater.

504
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:38,486
Rym: He just seems like a cool guy.

505
00:32:38,507 --> 00:32:39,431
Rym: They're not evil.

506
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:42,634
Rym: They're just good at basketball Apparently makes them evil.

507
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:44,404
Scott: yeah But it's so.

508
00:32:44,424 --> 00:32:53,634
Scott: if the show is concentrating on all the wrong things the worst character on the entire earth team is Concentrated on the most while the cool captain either team barely gets any time.

509
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:55,280
Rym: Yeah, we can go over the characters briefly.

510
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,109
Rym: I don't remember their names.

511
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,342
Rym: It doesn't fucking matter It's.

512
00:32:58,442 --> 00:33:02,096
Rym: it's a typical harem show school whatever.

513
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,280
Rym: They're all just this area.

514
00:33:04,022 --> 00:33:10,000
Scott: Ready, there's the old guy who owns the team who's sort of yelling and screaming even though he should be kind of more serious.

515
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,893
Scott: Yeah, there's the female coach who's all business.

516
00:33:13,254 --> 00:33:13,495
Rym: Yep.

517
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:20,220
Scott: There's the Female player who's sort of bratty, but she's obviously like you know the girl you end up with type.

518
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,728
Rym: There's the main character who we've talked about.

519
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:26,720
Scott: there's the captain who's calm cool and collected like Takahashi Rios, okay?

520
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,446
Rym: Yeah, that guy's the only smart guy.

521
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:37,200
Scott: There's the guy who's kind of like Katani Toga who's sort of like driving his convertible and being all badass with the ladies.

522
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:40,231
Scott: There's the muscly guy who's a lot like Armstrong.

523
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:44,028
Scott: He's the guy who looking at the fan letter where he's a softy But he's huge and muscly.

524
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:48,890
Scott: there's the token black guy Who's acts like a token black guy?

525
00:33:48,911 --> 00:33:50,660
Scott: It's all stir, but he's not really that black.

526
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,082
Scott: It's sort of.

527
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:55,239
Scott: it's sort of weird that you have this all-earth basketball team with so few black people on it.

528
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:58,699
Scott: It seems kind of wrong and sort of racist in a way.

529
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:10,864
Rym: You know I'm not gonna Pick with this show because I would like to point out that buzzer beater is directed by none other than the famous wonderful Shigeyuki mia.

530
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:25,414
Rym: now this person is responsible for jack all so he's directed buzzer beater some other buzzer beater and The pawn the third angel tactic special and that's it now.

531
00:34:25,454 --> 00:34:28,466
Rym: he did animation for x-driver Which was also a crap show.

532
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,253
Rym: just happened to have a good character designer.

533
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:31,880
Scott: extra x-driver was shit.

534
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,463
Rym: It was.

535
00:34:32,563 --> 00:34:35,320
Scott: I was like about it though the thing is I was excited about it.

536
00:34:35,621 --> 00:34:37,010
Rym: I really thought it was gonna be awesome.

537
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,780
Scott: I get another show with a good premise.

538
00:34:38,821 --> 00:34:39,125
Scott: I mean like.

539
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:40,020
Scott: I could write.

540
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:48,080
Scott: I can't write fiction for shit But I could write or at least come up with in my mind a story involving aliens in basketball.

541
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:52,475
Scott: That would kind of be an average to middling and it was that movie with Bugs Bunny.

542
00:34:53,078 --> 00:34:55,246
Rym: Yeah, you're right That was a lot better than this crap.

543
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:55,627
Rym: Yeah.

544
00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:58,959
Scott: Yeah buzzer beater is just bad space jam in a way.

545
00:35:00,283 --> 00:35:01,491
Scott: It didn't have Michael Jordan.

546
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:03,925
Scott: it didn't have Looney Tunes.

547
00:35:04,306 --> 00:35:06,857
Scott: it didn't have cool aliens that are actually characters.

548
00:35:06,877 --> 00:35:08,766
Scott: it There's nothing.

549
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:10,695
Scott: it just has annoying Edward Elric guy.

550
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:18,060
Rym: I Really don't like this show and I'm just not just I mean, I don't really like a lot of sports anime.

551
00:35:18,746 --> 00:35:21,967
Rym: But forget that This show is bad.

552
00:35:22,048 --> 00:35:24,880
Scott: If you like sports anime watch anything else is like so bad.

553
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,828
Rym: It's watch I shield 21 or something.

554
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:29,520
Scott: Maybe if you watch this show with a large group of people.

555
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:31,860
Rym: Oh, this show would be great to show to an anime club.

556
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:40,915
Scott: Maybe it depends because it while there are many parts that are good to show to a large group of people You know certain scenes where everyone would laugh and get a good time a lot of it.

557
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:42,180
Scott: They just be sitting there going.

558
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:45,109
Rym: Here's how you show the show to an anime club.

559
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,760
Rym: You show four episodes of four different shows.

560
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:48,542
Scott: Okay.

561
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:52,853
Rym: Yeah first episode this second episode some other crappy show.

562
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:54,397
Rym: third episode some other crappy show.

563
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:56,222
Rym: fourth one size and Jotaro I.

564
00:35:56,282 --> 00:36:10,290
Scott: that would work if you showed it with other shows, but I think just watching this alone at an anime club There are scenes that everyone would get a laugh from but overall most people just be like wow I really don't like this show.

565
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:11,436
Scott: So it's just bad.

566
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:14,951
Rym: I don't know Why this is the kind of show that Dave and Joel need to make fun of.

567
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:16,940
Scott: I guess it's just bad.

568
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:21,278
Scott: I don't know if there are the words besides bad sad mad glad.

569
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:28,626
Scott: no Glad is not a good word for this plaid terrible horrendous Vomitation.

570
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:38,514
Scott: very bad very sad Even if you're the biggest Basketball anime fan like your two things in life are basketball and anime.

571
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:39,938
Scott: stay away from this.

572
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:44,873
Scott: do not go Active not watch Geiger counter off the charts.

573
00:36:45,154 --> 00:36:45,756
Scott: You will die.

574
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:49,340
Rym: Do not touch You know, I think we're done with that show.

575
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,529
Rym: But Scott pointed out a little while ago and we've realized that we really only review shows that we really like or we really don't Like.

576
00:36:55,674 --> 00:37:06,656
Scott: yeah I'm gonna try to find some middle-of-the-road shows that we don't that we either don't like a whole lot or don't hate a whole Completely or I'm gonna try to find some shows where we disagree.

577
00:37:06,737 --> 00:37:07,440
Scott: That's kind of hard.

578
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,808
Rym: Yeah, I can think of a few like tenchi muyo.

579
00:37:09,848 --> 00:37:11,152
Rym: We kind of disagree a lot.

580
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:15,104
Rym: Yes, you know, I really like Some of tenchi muyo.

581
00:37:15,124 --> 00:37:19,580
Scott: Yeah, I've only seen some of tenchi muyo and what I've seen I did not like.

582
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:21,308
Rym: See how the first OAV is good.

583
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,233
Rym: The first movie is good.

584
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,500
Rym: The second movie is not so bad.

585
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,414
Scott: I've seen some stuff on Cartoon Network and I did not like that doesn't?

586
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:29,288
Scott: I don't know what it was And it was.

587
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,500
Rym: I'll tell you real quick the story about tenchi.

00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:50,360
Rym: And then the guy who made tenchi Saw liked what he did and decided that he wanted to recapture that magic Forever and he has failed in every attempt from this from that day forward.

590
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:58,069
Scott: I also saw tenchi muyo GXP, but I just read as far as I had a great opening song though That's see there's.

591
00:37:58,391 --> 00:38:03,353
Rym: that's a show we could do Anime that has music that was wasted on that show.

592
00:38:03,373 --> 00:38:05,079
Scott: There's a lot of those XP.

593
00:38:05,745 --> 00:38:08,719

596
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:23,095
Rym: But when it comes to tenchi muyo GXP pretend that I Can somehow give birth to an anime and that my child was tenchi muyo GXP.

607
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:10,260
