1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,868
Rym: It's Thursday, June 18th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:11,289
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:14,097
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:20,560
Rym: We are talking about Pencils and pens and stationery and if you have any ideas for Thursday shows let us know.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,758
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:29,567
Rym: so uh every like Couple weeks.

7
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:42,483
Rym: I got to go into a work thing and you know there's a system We use to like put in vacation days or like if you're gonna work from home you flag like I'll be working from home on this particular day and I have to keep just adding like Another month.

8
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:44,169
Rym: to the end of the time.

9
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:47,180
Rym: I'm going to be working from home every day, and I just did that today.

10
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,139
Rym: I have 68 work from home days in my calendar currently.

11
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:55,179
Scott: All right, I mean, I don't I don't have to do that.

12
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:58,679
Rym: Yeah, I mean I work for a big company, so I got to do stuff like that.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,493
Scott: There's all this sort of tracking why it's one of the many reasons.

14
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:03,060
Scott: I do not work at any big company.

15
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,752
Rym: That's good though because it's like it just handles stuff pretty like.

16
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:14,363
Rym: I don't have to talk to a person like if I'm on jury Duty, I just go into this thing and I type some stuff, and it's all just handled like I don't have to tell anyone Don't have to do anything.

17
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,872
Scott: I mean I just sent someone email.

18
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:18,919
Rym: Oh, yeah, I don't even have to interact with a human.

19
00:01:19,822 --> 00:01:22,205
Scott: Okay Sending is that I like.

20
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:26,280
Scott: dealing with forms is somehow easier than a slack message like yo jury duty tomorrow.

21
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:27,500
Rym: It's not a form.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,344
Rym: It's more like just.

23
00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:31,900
Rym: I can have an app that I can use to set things like my calendar.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,290
Scott: I have an available black.

25
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,398
Scott: yeah, that's called Gmail.

26
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:40,820
Rym: I Just miss it, but it also does things like it'll block phone calls outside of the hours.

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,106
Rym: I say I'm gonna be working.

28
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:50,507
Rym: so like no one can even try to contact me outside of the hours I specifically specify in there, so I set up all these don't have a work phone Problem solved.

29
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:51,518
Scott: no one can call me ever.

30
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:55,360
Rym: I have an a role where people do need to be able to call me on occasion.

31
00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:58,259
Scott: If I was a CEO of a company I'd be like no phones.

32
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:01,500
Rym: One thing I would do if I was a CEO of a company is banned voicemail.

33
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,698
Scott: But most good companies are banning voicemail anyway, so yeah, I'd be getting rid of a lot of that stuff.

34
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:10,310
Rym: Yeah So yeah again.

35
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,300
Rym: normally we'd talk about open events or whatever.

36
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:17,137
Rym: But yeah, the world's kind of on fire and the virus is getting world still on fire.

37
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:18,161
Scott: news at 11.

38
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:31,212
Rym: Yep, so all I got to say about that is pay attention if you notice We're not talking a lot about anything other than the anti police movement the protests and politics on our social media Because those are kind of more important, but

39
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:34,727
Scott: I got a virus test today even though I've never had any virus symptom.

40
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:38,060
Scott: It was free and I can literally see the testing center from my window.

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,011
Scott: I'm looking at it right now.

42
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:43,785
Scott: I'm like well, and they said on the website Every New Yorker should go there.

43
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:44,147
Scott: I'm like well.

44
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:44,769
Scott: I'm a New Yorker.

45
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,894
Rym: Yeah, more data is better.

46
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:49,185
Scott: all right whatever We'll see what it says.

47
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:51,075
Scott: they should get a result within 48 hours.

48
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:55,655
Scott: I hope it says Negative, but if it says positive, then it's that it's a bunch of questions.

49
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:59,673
Scott: right because it's like well Does that mean I'm one of the people who got it with no symptom?

50
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:01,039
Scott: Yep does that mean?

51
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:04,110
Scott: I'm gonna get sick soon like you're.

52
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,720
Rym: just it was really good timing.

53
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,503
Rym: I'm gonna start.

54
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:08,272
Scott: I'm gonna start coughing in a few days.

55
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:09,719
Scott: Yeah, does it mean I?

56
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,727
Scott: Just spread it to everyone.

57
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:12,775
Scott: when I went to the grocery store.

58
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:19,192
Scott: Just now It's like I. I don't know What happens if it comes back positive, but there is.

59
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:21,119
Scott: they gave me a a what now?

60
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,778
Scott: Brochure that says if it's positive do these things.

61
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:27,719
Scott: Hopefully I won't have to do those things.

62
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:39,500
Rym: I'm actually getting next week interestingly enough that companies just like offer like getting everyone to do it I'm getting training in like contact tracing and like how that works and end of the methodology and everything.

63
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:50,440
Rym: Not like a certification to go like do that for a company or like a hospital, but just to basically fully understand the process I'm really usually just a lot of most of it is like a manual labor kind of thing.

64
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,877
Scott: Okay, talk to the person find out who they were with then call all those people and find out who they were with and which days.

65
00:03:57,561 --> 00:04:05,299
Rym: Yeah, but it's also it's got some cool stuff in it like the current state of like What are the known symptoms and what are the progressions and all that kind of stuff.

66
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:05,440
Rym: so?

67
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:15,143
Rym: It's it'll be an interesting thing like I don't know what I'll do with that information But feels like information that might be vaguely useful Can't can't hurt.

68
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:16,949
Scott: You know I'm having actually you know even though.

69
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:28,286
Scott: I'm you know the one of the most skeptical people alive And I'm always questioning whether things are real or not real you know even I'm having a hard time telling it's like okay There's some stuff.

70
00:04:28,326 --> 00:04:29,314
Scott: That's clearly bullshit.

71
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:34,513
Rym: and this stuff That's clearly well like that t-mobile is down because North Korean nonsense.

72
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:38,020
Rym: that happened earlier in the week where people were like making shit up about exactly.

73
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:39,748
Scott: But this you know.

74
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:40,893
Scott: regarding the virus.

75
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:41,838
Scott: There's a lot of stuff.

76
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:43,383
Scott: That's like We we don't know.

77
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:50,444
Scott: and even people I know like my friend who's like you know has a PhD in epidemiology She doesn't know.

78
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:52,733
Scott: she's like yeah, you know it's.

79
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:57,569
Scott: it's certainly possible that Asymptomatic people are going around spreading this thing everywhere.

80
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,552
Scott: Yeah, we don't know.

81
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:00,458
Scott: still we still are not sure.

82
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:07,108
Rym: well like the way I've heard like in my normal life like if it's an area I know Then I can do primary research with one.

83
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:10,940
Rym: like if there's one source I can do primary research to see if it's plausible or not.

84
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,873
Rym: If it's an area, I don't know, but it's not the virus.

85
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:15,300
Rym: I can do what journalists do.

86
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:18,772
Rym: There's got to be two independent sources before I trust anything like.

87
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:19,776
Rym: that's a good rule of thumb.

88
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:24,954
Rym: if you see a news story That seems crazy and only one news organization is talking about it.

89
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:26,540
Rym: Do not retweet that shit.

90
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:41,180
Rym: But when it comes to the virus like I'm hesitant to really like retweet or comment or say anything unless I see like four or five independent sources because There's just a lot of fake nonsense going around.

91
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:44,860
Rym: Oh, yeah, and I don't know anything about that like talk about a domain.

92
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:46,297
Rym: I don't know a lot about.

93
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:52,877
Scott: All I know is what I what I read and I only repeat things if I read them on.

94
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:59,620
Scott: you know very Trusted places otherwise otherwise I'll either don't say anything or I say I heard this.

95
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,222
Scott: I don't know.

96
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:02,873
Scott: like I said, I don't I don't know if you spread it.

97
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:03,857
Scott: We don't know.

98
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:06,029
Rym: well like one thing What does it mean if I'm positive?

99
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,734
Scott: I don't freaking know.

100
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:10,709
Rym: one thing we do know Red states are having huge spikes right now.

101
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:11,933
Rym: That's so far.

102
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:19,032
Rym: blue states are not based solely on How they planned to reopen and whether or not they encourage people to wear masks.

103
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:21,218
Scott: a great example is this story.

104
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:27,065
Scott: people may have seen this story that talked about Two hairdressers who got.

105
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:33,664
Scott: they're definitely sick at least according to the story and none of supposedly none of their customers Got sick even though they were open.

106
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:43,318
Scott: and the story the store that they tell is while the hairdressers are so responsible wearing masks and Washing hands and whatnot that none of the customers got sick.

107
00:06:43,438 --> 00:06:48,215
Scott: therefore I guess masks and hand-washing works, and I'm like do I believe this story.

108
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:51,646
Scott: I don't freaking know or anything You know it's like.

109
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:54,056
Scott: I feel like someone who's pushing that story hard.

110
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:57,004
Scott: is someone who wants Hairdressers to be open?

111
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:58,770
Rym: yeah, well, that's the thing.

112
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,013
Rym: what the?

113
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:04,215
Rym: I saw a really interesting article that's not about the virus itself, so I'm more like.

114
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:14,900
Rym: but it was a statistical study of When the rules change like if a state like reopens or says things are okay Regardless of what the government's saying in a particular area.

115
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:20,860
Rym: Will the people in that area actually just go out or will they continue to be cautious and they think you know?

116
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,519
Scott: I'm gonna continue to be at least one or two or more phases more cautious than yep.

117
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,189
Rym: well Yeah, so get this.

118
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:33,611
Rym: that study like Indicated that it bait it boils down to partisanship.

119
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:36,119
Rym: Democrats will stay home a lot longer than Republicans like.

120
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:36,420
Rym: that's it.

121
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:37,812
Rym: That's the sole factor.

122
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:50,005
Rym: well, that's Good Yeah, well it's good for us Directly, but it's bad for like anyone who's stuck living in a red state who is not evil I don't know.

123
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:52,079
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna figure out a way to get them out somehow.

124
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,386
Rym: Whatever yep, so wear your mask out there guys and If there's a don't go out.

125
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:03,254
Scott: unless you have to go out like I want there to be a Pax I want to go to the beach.

126
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:03,780
Scott: real bad.

127
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:13,953
Rym: If there is a nerd convention in like Georgia or Florida that's gonna happen in July like I Would encourage you to not go to that convention in July.

128
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:20,637
Scott: just saying that friend I mentioned to as the PhD has not left their house since March not even one time.

129
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:21,560
Scott: Wow grocery.

130
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:36,380
Rym: So actually other than the second week of the quarantine I have not been inside any building except my own apartment building And I've only gone outside to basically run or get takeout from one restaurant and only one.

131
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:44,275
Scott: I have gone outside to go to the grocery briefly Only on the one Street Broadway that I live on.

132
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:48,389
Scott: you know a few different Groceries very infrequently right.

133
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:50,516
Scott: we're talking like less than once a week right.

134
00:08:50,717 --> 00:08:57,160
Scott: like once every few weeks I'll go outside to some grocery or groceries, and I went to the testing center today.

135
00:08:58,067 --> 00:08:58,975
Rym: I will actually tomorrow.

136
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:05,320
Rym: tomorrow I am going to the vet because they're the vet did finally reopen to do well and non-emergency visit.

137
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:15,220
Rym: So we're taking the rabbit in to get a bunch of checkups and things that are Overdue because we didn't really want to go to the animal hospital if it wasn't an emergency during the panic across the bridge.

138
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,540
Rym: Yeah, yep, but I'm gonna And I'm gonna bike him over there because I'm not taking a subway.

139
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,754
Scott: Yeah, I've left the apartment to go to the guy.

140
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:27,243
Scott: I'm in the building now That's it.

141
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:29,613
Rym: I run every day, but I basically like not.

142
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:31,140
Rym: so here's there's a fun opening pit.

143
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:47,374
Rym: There's basically no one outside unless you go to like the waterfront parks like in this part of Queens like nobody's outside except I'm like big main time a day and exacts place like yeah, Queensborough Plaza like north and south There's people and like the waterfront.

144
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:47,877
Rym: There's people.

145
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:55,100
Scott: and the bike path It's true for a long gone city Astoria in general is that if you go on a non main street?

146
00:09:55,481 --> 00:10:04,908
Scott: Like 43rd Road, I guess all these streets that aren't that don't have commercial storefronts on them Are typically empty.

147
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:07,480
Scott: Yeah, most of the time they're way more empty.

148
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:15,200
Rym: So where I run not only do I not see any people like I can do runs where once I get off Crescent Street I don't see a single human being till I get back to Crescent Street.

149
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:21,469
Scott: Yeah, Crescent Street's a busy commercial street what you walk one street over off Crescent it's not gonna be anyone there.

150
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:29,077
Rym: like I'll see between you have to cross, you know Five miles and see between zero and one humans on that entire run.

151
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:32,668
Rym: but Something novel has happened over the last week.

152
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:37,040
Rym: those parts of this area where I tend to run where there's no people like warehouses and stuff.

153
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:42,164
Rym: There are raccoons fucking everywhere Like trash.

154
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:44,209
Rym: raccoons are taken over the streets.

155
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:49,507
Rym: in Long Island City that I saw three separate families of raccoons And they were all just chillin.

156
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:54,834
Rym: one of them looked like they're semi permanently living under a car That clearly has not moved since the quarantine began.

157
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,819
Scott: Mm-hmm.

158
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:58,838
Rym: So, uh, yeah got any news.

159
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:01,387
Scott: Do I have a news?

160
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,641
Scott: Well, oh, yeah, so check this out as I Don't know.

161
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,413
Scott: you may or may not have heard of this product called base camp.

162
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,200
Scott: It's sort of like a project management thing.

163
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:15,176
Scott: It's been around for a super long time At least I feel like way over 10 years.

164
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:18,436
Scott: Yeah maybe 15 or so it's.

165
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:21,568
Scott: and Basically, it's like, you know, the it it's.

166
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:25,260
Scott: the selling point of these products is like they're sort of like for businesses.

167
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:27,769
Scott: They're competing with things like Jira.

168
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,700
Scott: They have a whole suite of apps, right?

169
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:38,996
Scott: And they really sell on their their, you know, some simple what really high polished design And they charge money for their app.

170
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:41,384
Rym: They're not free Which I'm a fan of like.

171
00:11:41,464 --> 00:11:46,799
Rym: I'm a fan of things that charge you money as opposed to charging you by stealing your data or Giving you ads.

172
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:48,083
Scott: Yeah, you could.

173
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:56,691
Scott: actually if you had a company you could just use like only base camp products if you wanted to and it's like It'll cover, you know, it'll replace like everything for you.

174
00:11:56,731 --> 00:11:57,373
Scott: You know, you get your.

175
00:11:57,814 --> 00:12:01,990
Scott: it can replace slack, you know There's message boards this project managing this.

176
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:04,160
Scott: I think they have time tracking.

177
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,795
Scott: I think they even have some Google Docs competing stuff documentation.

178
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:08,638
Scott: They got everything, right?

179
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,960
Scott: But you know, obviously they're not as big as the big boys right in all those products, right?

180
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:31,100
Scott: But anyway, they came out with a new product called hey hey calm they got that URL somehow And it's an email client and it's a really fancy kind of simple Polished and you know beautiful looking email client as you would expect, you know, it is someone who was a Google inbox user.

181
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:32,160
Scott: That's kind of appealing.

182
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,139
Scott: And of course, it's not free.

183
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,479
Scott: They charge $100 a year to use hey and you get a hey email address and all this stuff, right?

184
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:41,825
Scott: So like any app.

185
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:44,736
Scott: you make an app to go in that Apple App Store, right.

186
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:51,175
Scott: so Apple in the App Store, you know if you have any sort of in-app purchases, right?

187
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,521
Scott: They charge 30%.

188
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:54,906
Scott: So if I you know sell.

189
00:12:54,946 --> 00:13:02,070
Scott: if I have a game in the App Store and I sell you some coins for my game Apple is taking third and you buy a dollar of coins.

190
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,519
Scott: I only get 60 cents and Apple gets 30 cents.

191
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:08,620
Rym: That's a pretty big big like we've talked about that before.

192
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:14,820
Scott: Yeah, so there are obviously Exceptions to where you can get around this, right?

193
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:26,619
Scott: there are exceptions for if your app is Like an enterprise app of some kind right then you can get around this, right?

194
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:34,953
Scott: If your app is a reader app, right like a magazine Newspaper book app like the Kindle Amazon app you can on the Apple.

195
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,300
Scott: you can't buy Kindle books in the app.

196
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:43,940
Scott: You go to amazon.com in your browser in Safari and it won't even like link you to the browser to open it.

197
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,380
Scott: It's like you have to on your own open up your browser.

198
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,033
Rym: You know go all these like workarounds of shenanigans to get around this.

199
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:54,905
Scott: All right, you can't buy them in the Amazon App either.

200
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:57,339
Scott: it's like you have to right anyway.

201
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,125
Scott: There's exceptions, right?

202
00:14:00,185 --> 00:14:04,020
Scott: So you would think that like hey Netflix is similar to hey, right?

203
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,828
Scott: It's like it's a consumer product or business product or whatever And you buy the subscription.

204
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,980
Scott: you can't buy a Netflix subscription on your iPhone.

205
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,380
Scott: You have to buy it on netflix.com and then you can use the Netflix app.

206
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,699
Scott: so it's like well there by a hey at subscription on hey calm and then use the hey app.

207
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:27,399
Scott: and So they got rejected from the App Store and they appealed and Apple rejected them again.

208
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:35,351
Scott: And you know clearly this is a state at whoever wrote This wasn't just like, you know filling out some form letter right.

209
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:40,076
Scott: whoever wrote the rejection from Apple clearly understands the whole situation.

210
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:43,468
Rym: Yep, some escalation occurred here.

211
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:49,887
Scott: Yeah, they're basically clearly citing these three Exceptions to where you can.

212
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:55,866
Scott: you know, not you can have an app in the store that you know Where the payment happens somewhere else.

213
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:56,909
Scott: and there's state.

214
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:04,432
Scott: they're saying yeah, your app doesn't meet any of the three Exceptions for in-app purchase reader apps multi-platform service, whatever.

215
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:07,100
Scott: So yeah, it shouldn't be allowed in the App Store.

216
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:09,337
Scott: Deal with it.

217
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:17,832
Scott: So I guess their options are a change their app which would basically defeat their business model for this app Right, which is they're selling the user interface.

218
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:20,566
Scott: They're not selling The email service.

219
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:31,556
Scott: Yeah of having a hey calm email address Or Not be in the App Store on Apple devices with this app that they already developed.

220
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:32,620
Scott: so they worked on this app.

221
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,300
Scott: They spent their own money to develop this app, right and now they can't sell it.

222
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,220
Scott: It's like they just wasted all that time and effort all those developers programming for no reason, right?

223
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:46,898
Scott: They made a thing that will not be used Or they can try to sue Apple.

224
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:48,942
Scott: Good luck.

225
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:56,431
Rym: It's just an interesting situation in general that Apple devices for being so ubiquitous are Hard to use in corporate environments.

226
00:15:56,551 --> 00:16:01,805
Rym: when you like run into situations like this Mm-hmm.

227
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:05,460
Scott: I mean if your app is on the App Store, then it's really easy to use, right?

228
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:07,371
Rym: Yeah, but only if it can the app stores.

229
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:08,579
Rym: you got to play these games.

230
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:09,805
Scott: Well, usually right.

231
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:16,206
Scott: if you're a if you're a company and you're buying You're choosing what to your company to use.

232
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:19,115
Scott: you're gonna choose something that has their app in the App Store.

233
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:19,837
Scott: Yeah, right.

234
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:36,907
Scott: So basically Because even that wouldn't be a concern if it was a company that just gave everyone like here's your here's your work smartphone Right, um, you know, so you're gonna be choosing things that have iPhone apps, but if you are Making apps for the iPhone, right?

235
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:45,156
Scott: That's where you're getting screwed if you get locked out because it's like well now It's like like even me someone who you know, do I do?

236
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:48,714
Scott: I want to do hey calm It's like a kind of you know, not a little bit.

237
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:49,418
Scott: I probably wouldn't.

238
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:58,915
Scott: yeah I mean, we're pretty deep in the Google ecosystem even though they say but it's like I do want to go back to the Google Inbox days so that a better user interface for email is appealing to me.

239
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:09,599
Scott: It might get me to spend money Maybe not on this but you know, yeah, I 1% considered it right but like well They're just they're just not gonna get customers now because they don't have the iPhone app, right?

240
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,300
Scott: It's like why would anyone pay for hey, if you aren't gonna get pay under iPhone?

241
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:23,858
Scott: Yep, if you unless your whole company is Android and your Android and everybody knows Android Hey is just a non-starter now?

242
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:33,420
Rym: Well, I mean if I'm Android and you're not I can just email your busted gmail from my awesome Hey via my Android phone and I'm good, right?

243
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,605
Scott: but you'd see the point.

244
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:40,831
Scott: but if you know if we're a company why would you pay for hey if Our employees with iPhones aren't gonna have have an app, right?

245
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,160
Scott: Yeah, so we're not gonna pay for it at all.

246
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,129
Scott: We'll just stick with something else that has an iPhone app.

247
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:47,520
Rym: So in some other news, I'm gonna link to this.

248
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,680
Rym: But there's a lot of stories that are telling a similar story.

249
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:52,819
Rym: This is just one of the myriad I found out there.

250
00:17:53,181 --> 00:18:12,300
Rym: But at the beginning of the quarantine and the crisis And everyone like everyone who could work at home started working from home like everyone sort of tested out their BCP policies and schools all had to go remote and I saw a lot of people saying things like This just proves that we could have been working from home all along.

251
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:15,279
Rym: This just proves that we could have been running schools from home all along.

252
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:17,760
Rym: That is not really true.

253
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:23,923
Rym: Most jobs are not going that well with people working from home compared to how they went Previously.

254
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:25,349
Rym: things are starting to slow down.

255
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:26,353
Rym: things are starting to fail.

256
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:28,040
Rym: things are not working that great.

257
00:18:28,461 --> 00:18:41,188
Rym: But people who are saying that a probably worked jobs that could be done from home Yep, like I do a job where I could do the job a hundred percent from home due to the unique nature of my job There is no technical reason.

258
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:44,866
Scott: I can't do my job from home But I can't lie.

259
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:46,914
Scott: I do way less work at home.

260
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:48,620
Scott: I'm constantly doing other shit.

261
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:49,985
Rym: Most people are like that.

262
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:54,020
Rym: but also like even if you're not just goofing off which a lot of goofing off.

263
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,265
Rym: Yeah, I'm not gonna blame anyone.

264
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:56,129
Rym: the world's on fire.

265
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:57,415
Rym: You should be goofing off.

266
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:58,178
Scott: You're not goofing off.

267
00:18:58,198 --> 00:18:58,640
Scott: Something's wrong.

268
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,768
Rym: Everyone's allowed to goof off a little bit.

269
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:03,077
Rym: The share zone skeleton has good advice.

270
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:04,800
Rym: steal from work That's right.

271
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:13,347
Rym: But even if you are working like hard like seven and a half hours plus a lunch break while you're working from home There's a lot of things that just take longer.

272
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:25,291
Rym: like I am perfectly good writing a like 4,000 word email to an engineer who will then respond with another 4,000 word email and as those emails progress We'll get our work done.

273
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:26,582
Rym: same thing I've like.

274
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:31,840
Rym: there's people I can I be where I am with like send you an instant message have a conversation online and that works.

275
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:37,740
Rym: But I also there are a lot of people I work with who just aren't that effective unless you talk to them in person.

276
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:39,207
Scott: So fire those people.

277
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:41,057
Rym: Yeah, but most humans are like.

278
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:41,740
Rym: that is the problem.

279
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:47,640
Rym: Most humans like like if you have to have it like five people have a discussion and whiteboard something.

280
00:19:48,182 --> 00:19:50,611
Rym: They just get more done if they're in a room together.

281
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:52,939
Rym: then if they're all on like a zoom call or something.

282
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:58,980
Scott: Well, there's also, you know, I think that's a definite also a very white-collar centric perspective.

283
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,969
Rym: Oh, yeah, look at all the jobs that can't work from home.

284
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,180
Rym: Like garbage man can't telecommute.

285
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:05,646
Rym: We don't have robot bodies to go out and do it.

286
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:06,869
Scott: That's right.

287
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,213
Rym: Most jobs are not.

288
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:09,376
Rym: I sit number.

289
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:18,206
Scott: one job in the United States That employs the most people like not company but job position is Driver of vehicle.

290
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:21,340
Rym: Yeah, then you might think oh the driver drive vehicle from home.

291
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,940
Scott: Well, we have remote control vehicle, you know as much as everyone talks about automatic cars.

292
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:32,940
Rym: I am shocked that I mean look someone in like Arizona can pilot a drone overseas and murder people.

293
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:43,220
Rym: I feel like a trucker sitting at home with a hot ass or a steering wheel and a computer could drive a Semi-truck and could even have a backup driver ready to take over if something happens.

294
00:20:44,463 --> 00:20:51,895
Rym: I'm surprised that technology has not moved further Because I think well because it would destroy that sector like wages would go down to nothing.

295
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:53,320
Rym: that would turn into a minimum wage job.

296
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:55,480
Scott: Well, I think also the telecommunications.

297
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,600
Rym: But we trust that for fucking drones that murder people, right?

298
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:07,386
Scott: But there are so few drones true right that you have the bandwidth to control them all on your special Satellite just for controlling.

299
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:11,160
Scott: the drone drew right you to control every truck in America.

300
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:24,570
Scott: I don't think we have you know Even just one country even just one state every truck to have a driver at home the bandwidth To send all the video feeds to the driver Yeah and then for the driver to send their control inputs back to the truck.

301
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,523
Rym: 5g the 5g or something with a minimum latency and Reliability.

302
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:32,740
Scott: it doesn't go down because they have to control the truck literally at every single moment.

303
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:37,199
Scott: It can't go down for like a few seconds even right and they're the delay that to not.

304
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:41,559
Rym: well I would cheat a little bit by using current driving technology.

305
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:43,665
Scott: current Do that I'm just saying.

306
00:21:43,705 --> 00:21:48,660
Scott: is that the bandwidth for the data for all the trucks all those video feeds?

307
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:50,708
Scott: It just this so met.

308
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:52,214
Scott: I don't think you they would do something.

309
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:53,600
Scott: the network as a whole.

310
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:55,520
Scott: We don't think we have the total capacity.

311
00:21:55,821 --> 00:22:06,332
Scott: Well anyway, I guess my imagine if everyone with a computer opened up ten twitch streams all at once It's like the network that the you know The pipe upstream pipe would start to fill.

312
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,025
Rym: I feel like we could build those pipe, but anyway That's a Monday discussion.

313
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:09,247
Rym: the point.

314
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:10,253
Scott: I don't exist now.

315
00:22:10,273 --> 00:22:12,547
Scott: I'm not saying we can't build them I don't exist now.

316
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:13,071
Rym: the point.

317
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:15,724
Rym: I want to make is More important.

318
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:21,120
Rym: even truck drivers if they're like safe driving their trucks feels like they'd be safe.

319
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:22,309
Rym: You know they're only in their truck.

320
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:26,368
Rym: They got to stop at rest stops They got a pee they gotta eat they get.

321
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:30,000
Rym: the truck has to get loaded or not loaded like most people cannot tell a commute.

322
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:44,360
Rym: But this article is actually talking about specifically education like school because school all went remote even if you Ignore the very real problem that poor kids don't have good internet and poor kids don't have computers.

323
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:52,173
Rym: Even if you ignore that like gaping problem Remote education just didn't fucking work at all.

324
00:22:52,214 --> 00:22:53,500
Rym: like kids did not learn?

325
00:22:54,282 --> 00:22:57,935
Rym: Of course not and there's a lot of reasons why like on one hand schools

326
00:22:58,035 --> 00:22:58,637
Scott: obvious schools

327
00:22:58,658 --> 00:23:12,039
Rym: are babysitters But now parents have to be the babysitters, which is now affecting the parents performance at work, but the kids just aren't learning like kids in like high school and middle school and elementary school like this year and next year.

328
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,987
Rym: I Don't know what we're gonna.

329
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:14,510
Rym: Do like.

330
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:15,839
Rym: they just didn't learn anything.

331
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:21,334
Rym: Even worse like imagine kids in college.

332
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,489
Rym: RIT's tuition Made sense for us right because we were there.

333
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,640
Rym: the experience at RIT in person was what we were paying for.

334
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:39,388
Rym: If I was paying that amount of money just to take online Classes the classes that I skipped most of the time when I was there physically I would have dropped out Alrighty, why would you?

335
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:41,120
Scott: why would you pay that much money for that?

336
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,720
Rym: Yeah, if you're paying that much money for that go like learn online for like Khan Academy or something.

337
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,251
Scott: Well, it's like colleges are always like building shit.

338
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:51,280
Scott: They're wasting all their money on building buildings.

339
00:23:51,440 --> 00:24:00,640
Scott: Yeah, instantly even though they have enough buildings already because that's what you're paying for is like I'm gonna go live in this place where they've built all this awesome shit, right?

340
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:09,428
Rym: And live on this amazing campus of learning and up you know and also be embedded with peers to be able to learn together And network and like all those things.

341
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:10,836
Rym: you're not getting any of that.

342
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:12,183
Rym: if you're going to go You're like.

343
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:19,554
Scott: also most things you do at college Right are not just those buildings for fun.

344
00:24:19,614 --> 00:24:21,360
Scott: It's like those buildings were for learning.

345
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,248
Rym: Yeah, like I was like like.

346
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:24,613
Rym: there were labs that had the equipment.

347
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,120
Rym: I could not get at home.

348
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:27,786
Scott: Yeah, it's like okay.

349
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:28,771
Scott: I did computer science.

350
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,019
Scott: I have a computer at home.

351
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,611
Scott: sure I you know a lot, but it's like you know.

352
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:34,420
Scott: so how much did I need the computer lab?

353
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,873
Scott: I you know I used it a lot, but I didn't have to.

354
00:24:36,913 --> 00:24:37,879
Scott: I could have gone without.

355
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:45,063
Rym: yeah I had to use the computer lab because I had to like set up ten computers like physical computers and build a network and do Some crap.

356
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:45,626
Rym: I can't do that.

357
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:48,260
Scott: I still took frickin chemistry classes.

358
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:53,085
Scott: You know all kinds of other classes Digital audio class like.

359
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:58,942
Rym: there was a full recording studio with quiet rooms and everything There were.

360
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:02,832
Scott: there were lots of facilities for learning that were legitimately used.

361
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:05,960
Scott: not all of that building stuff is just you know egregious.

362
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:09,408
Scott: You know college is trying to look fancy.

363
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,635
Scott: Yeah, it's like a lot of that money.

364
00:25:11,675 --> 00:25:14,591
Scott: They spend on actual learning Art class.

365
00:25:14,611 --> 00:25:15,600
Scott: you know it's like okay.

366
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,811
Scott: There were people there who had like but even literally their major.

367
00:25:19,072 --> 00:25:21,460
Scott: their major was like ceramics, right?

368
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,865
Scott: So you go in and it's like.

369
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:24,873
Scott: it's like you know pottery.

370
00:25:25,135 --> 00:25:25,516
Scott: Yeah, honey.

371
00:25:25,536 --> 00:25:25,777
Scott: Well.

372
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:26,360
Scott: You know it's like.

373
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:32,240
Rym: What about the kids who are in packaging science or computer engineering like all right?

374
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:39,540
Scott: I have to fabricate our RAM chip as my problem this after computers the next biggest thing at RIT was photography.

375
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,019
Scott: Yeah, it's like they had all these dark rooms and all kinds of shit going on there.

376
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:49,537
Scott: But anyway even all they had were more powerful to the computers most people had even all.

377
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:52,928
Rym: that is not The worst problem with school.

378
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:56,780
Rym: the problem this article talks about is like this fundamental problem.

379
00:25:57,283 --> 00:25:59,398
Rym: No one gave a shit, and no one even tried.

380
00:26:00,265 --> 00:26:00,830
Scott: No person.

381
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:01,920
Rym: teachers barely tried.

382
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:03,404
Rym: Administrators barely tried.

383
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:04,889
Rym: schools barely tried kids.

384
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:08,400
Rym: most like in a lot of districts kids just didn't show up at all and no one cared.

385
00:26:09,404 --> 00:26:13,060
Scott: I mean the psychology of being in a particular place.

386
00:26:13,663 --> 00:26:22,723
Scott: Right it's like you know even if you're a bad kid bad In quotes right yeah bad quotes with an asterisk to a whole Conversation.

387
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:25,972
Scott: who goes to school and doesn't care and goofs off right.

388
00:26:26,354 --> 00:26:28,420
Scott: there's still that you know.

389
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,605
Scott: Psychology of.

390
00:26:29,906 --> 00:26:30,891
Scott: you're in school.

391
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:31,192
Scott: now.

392
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:34,402
Scott: the place of learning yeah Versus.

393
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:38,255
Scott: it's like if you're at home and the learning is like happening on a screen.

394
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:42,330
Rym: It's like you're like I know what I was like in middle school.

395
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:43,856
Rym: I know exactly what would.

396
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:44,499
Scott: I'm like that.

397
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,609
Scott: now We have meetings at work right.

398
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:53,860
Scott: and I'm it's like the meeting is happening And I feel like people pay just enough attention to not get caught right to talk when it's their turn.

399
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,208
Scott: Yeah, and then are there?

400
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:57,300
Scott: is anyone listening to what I'm saying right?

401
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,232
Scott: It's like I think even though I'm barely listening.

402
00:27:00,312 --> 00:27:02,100
Scott: I think I might actually be listening the most.

403
00:27:03,141 --> 00:27:05,470
Scott: I think I reply to things people say more.

404
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,691
Scott: No.

405
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:07,337
Scott: I don't think anyone's ever replied to anything.

406
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,140
Scott: I said they just.

407
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:11,309
Scott: You know recognize that you know.

408
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,035
Scott: okay, no one's talking.

409
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:14,459
Scott: it must be my turn to say something.

410
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:26,553
Rym: yep I mean, this is all solvable but the problem is it requires us as a society to invest in infrastructure and training and teachers and all these things of our Country has zero interest in funding.

411
00:27:26,956 --> 00:27:30,757
Rym: so uh Maybe we can defund the police and start paying for some of this stuff.

412
00:27:32,042 --> 00:27:37,997
Rym: Sure, but anyway big Things of the day.

413
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:39,301
Rym: so check this out.

414
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:52,777
Rym: This is a pretty short video like it's not super long You don't have to get deeply invested in it But it's a high-level walkthrough of how the Soviet Union planned cities and urban spaces Poorly not poorly actually.

415
00:27:52,817 --> 00:28:04,370
Rym: it is fascinating because it's a sort of very direct look at What were Soviet cities which were mostly designed cities like they would have empty land and try to plan a city as opposed to?

416
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,529
Rym: let it grow naturally or let it be driven by private interests.

417
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:15,590
Rym: and It talks of a lot about the cities and how they were the way they were based on the goals that were given to the planners.

418
00:28:16,212 --> 00:28:25,910
Rym: And the thing that a lot of Americans in particular probably don't know a lot about and this is part that I'm I know a lot About because I'm kind of deeply fascinated with the Soviet Union for a lot of reasons.

419
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:28,439
Rym: But I'm not saying it was all good over there.

420
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,162
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

421
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:32,924
Rym: There were problems in the Soviet Union Three big ones.

422
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:50,050
Rym: Yes but the stated goals of what they were designing their cities for is like this Diametric opposition to what American planned cities were designed for Soviet city and I'm gonna just summarize because you can watch this video.

423
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:55,344
Rym: But they were designed to under some certain assumptions one that everyone gets a home no matter what.

424
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:57,270
Rym: there is no homelessness no matter what?

425
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:06,330
Rym: to Personal space should be minimized and more investment should be put into shared spaces to foster more community.

426
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:09,018
Rym: Don't put gyms in every apartment building.

427
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:29,830
Rym: have central gyms that everyone has access to things like that But also the idea that the smallest unit of design should be the micro neighborhood which is basically a unit within which Every single person has equal access to every amenity and every micro unit has every required amenity.

428
00:29:30,112 --> 00:29:34,795
Rym: So if you live in like neighborhood a versus neighborhood Z ANZ both have a gym.

429
00:29:35,036 --> 00:29:35,979
Rym: They both have a pool.

430
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,282
Rym: They both have a hospital.

431
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,168
Rym: They both have schools, etc.

432
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:45,850
Rym: And Not saying that the Soviet system was perfect, but the American system is also fucking garbage.

433
00:29:46,071 --> 00:29:48,909
Rym: So yeah, we got to figure out a middle ground around this.

434
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:52,950
Scott: Well, there's also, you know the gap between the stated goals and the reality.

435
00:29:53,010 --> 00:30:04,430
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, we see other places who do have these stated goals place, you know I've seen you know cities and especially like in Europe and different places that are building cities in that way.

436
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,384
Rym: But then they're stated go like they'll have gaps.

437
00:30:06,444 --> 00:30:12,515
Rym: the people who plan Will miss something important that would have only arisen from the natural Evolution of a city.

438
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:17,093
Rym: and now you've built some giant thing that is flawed in some structural way Right.

439
00:30:17,253 --> 00:30:23,852
Scott: or you'd be like the United States where it's like the stated goals of the United States make money for private entrepreneurs Right.

440
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:24,194
Scott: It's like.

441
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:33,170
Scott: that's not the stated goal of the United States, but the machine that was built It's like they go around and they go and they say oh, yeah the United States It's all about freedom and equality.

442
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:37,010
Scott: But actually if you look at what the the machine and they built is none of those things.

443
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,620
Scott: It's just like this, you know, the the ideal is just this label.

444
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,920
Scott: Yeah, and so Soviet Union much in the same way It's like, you know, this is what we claim to believe in.

445
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:51,090
Scott: and then what they actually did doesn't necessarily match up Yep to what they you know.

446
00:30:51,090 --> 00:31:00,910
Rym: But a lot of the concepts of their city design were good and were undermined by other factors like the Cold War World War two Etc.

447
00:31:01,634 --> 00:31:02,679
Scott: the same for the whole world.

448
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:03,784
Scott: That's why it's World War.

449
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:08,740
Scott: Yep So what do you guys to the world what do I have?

450
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,270
Scott: All right, so bicycling which we can't avoid on a GeekNights.

451
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,630
Rym: Yeah, I was biking last weekend gonna be biking this weekend.

452
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:27,741
Scott: So, you know, it's been known for a while because we have a video evidence An indisputable video evidence of this one dude one time who was in a bike race And he did the Superman position on his bike like

453
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:30,853
Rym: belly on the saddle legs Belly

454
00:31:30,993 --> 00:31:35,750
Scott: on the saddle arms on the handlebars body completely straight feet not on the pedals.

455
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:38,029
Scott: I think this video was thing of the day at one point now.

456
00:31:38,692 --> 00:31:56,508
Rym: I did that once when I was in high school on a mountain bike on a very gentle grade thinking that out and all I will say is that even with those fat tires and that suspension and this gentle grade that is fucking scary as shit and almost impossible.

457
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:10,185
Scott: it is Incredibly scary and dangerous to to assume that position the Superman position on a bicycle, but it is supposedly quite Aerodynamic and speedy right as evidenced by the video that we saw.

458
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:13,235
Rym: the famous soon as he gets his leg up He just starts accelerating.

459
00:32:13,776 --> 00:32:16,505
Scott: but in actual bike races say a tour de France.

460
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:17,990
Scott: Oh, no one does that.

461
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,515
Scott: Yep, I think it's.

462
00:32:19,716 --> 00:32:21,763
Scott: I believe it might be a illegal.

463
00:32:22,165 --> 00:32:22,887
Rym: it probably should be.

464
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:25,339
Scott: If it's not illegal, it should be.

465
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:36,730
Scott: it's too dangerous, but be You can gain a speed advantage and if you're a tour de France because you can pedal right so You want the position that you would you know?

466
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:42,266
Scott: It's like giving up your feet on the pedals to gain the aerodynamic advantage isn't gonna help.

467
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:46,841
Rym: that'll only help on like Downgrades that are steeper than a certain amount right.

468
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:49,670
Scott: it's like you could just pedal harder because you're the world.

469
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,717
Scott: You know you're going for the world championship here.

470
00:32:51,998 --> 00:32:53,704
Scott: Yeah, it's like you know you'll.

471
00:32:54,065 --> 00:32:55,630
Scott: the pedaling is more important, right?

472
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,588
Scott: You don't want to give that up by taking your feet off.

473
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:07,264
Scott: So the question still is well if you're gonna keep your feet on the pedals and keep pedaling You still want an aerodynamic advantage.

474
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:08,610
Scott: that what you can get right?

475
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,175
Scott: It's like what's the best I can do?

476
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:14,410
Rym: because aerodynamics are the primary limiter of speed and endurance in biking right?

477
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:18,529
Scott: I can't do Superman right, but what can I do right?

478
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,810
Scott: I could put I could get all the way up and you know put the handlebars into my stomach.

479
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:26,701
Scott: I could put my ass way back behind the seat right.

480
00:33:26,822 --> 00:33:31,019
Scott: It's like there's several different like crouched Positions I can get.

481
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:36,210
Scott: clearly standing up is not the good one For going downhill right it's sort of obvious right.

482
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:44,269
Scott: But if I'm gonna crouch down on my bike try to get the aerodynamic and keep my feet on the pedals and keep pedaling We're going downhill.

483
00:33:45,094 --> 00:33:47,427
Scott: What is the best most aerodynamic?

484
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:47,870
Rym: Oh my god?

485
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:48,632
Rym: I'm looking at this.

486
00:33:48,812 --> 00:33:53,266
Rym: this link position F and position a are terrifying to me right.

487
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:54,710
Scott: so position a the Froom.

488
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:58,540
Scott: So Froom is basically the best cyclist around Chris Froom.

489
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:00,125
Scott: He's like the best these days.

490
00:34:00,526 --> 00:34:01,107
Scott: is he cheating?

491
00:34:01,187 --> 00:34:02,090
Scott: who knows right?

492
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:05,437
Scott: That's how cycling is.

493
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:08,509
Scott: a professional sport is but he's the best around right now.

494
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:15,297
Scott: and apparently what's interesting is that the position that he uses is Not the fastest.

495
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:27,449
Scott: It's actually like you know kind of meh Oh wow yeah the fastest position You know is actually also the safest position Which is where you basically?

496
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:33,409
Scott: Get down on up with your ass under the front of your seat, and you just put your body on top of the top tube.

497
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:36,518
Scott: So yeah, it's quite fascinating.

498
00:34:36,819 --> 00:34:46,909
Rym: Oh, I would not ride like that though I Mean it's not as safe as keeping your ass in the seat, but but the boys the boys are in a very precarious situation.

499
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:51,110
Scott: Yeah, well you're you're trying to win a race you're sacrificing the boys already.

500
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,542
Rym: Yeah, that is why I prefer mountain biking to the racing.

501
00:34:55,185 --> 00:35:02,293
Scott: just don't race just yeah slower Don't try to pass Chris Froom On the downhill.

502
00:35:03,096 --> 00:35:05,002
Rym: I love this disconnect between it's.

503
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:12,750
Scott: what I was fascinating though Is that you would think these professional racing teams would have studied this already and they go into like you know?

504
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,887
Scott: It's like they can't study everything right.

505
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:21,370
Scott: you know Even the pro cyclists who are studying their teams are figuring everything out best gearing best.

506
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:24,170
Scott: You know what's the best thing we can possibly do to go faster.

507
00:35:24,732 --> 00:35:36,409
Scott: They still can't look into everything so these independent researchers were able to Figure out the best position for downhill is something that the racers were just doing based on gut.

508
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:37,412
Scott: yeah What's?

509
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:44,190
Scott: and apparently the difference you know in was not enough to keep Chris Froom from winning right?

510
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,498
Scott: So it's not that big a deal.

511
00:35:46,538 --> 00:35:58,430
Scott: if you take into account all the factors of cycling This is only giving you a percentage advantage with downhill aerodynamics Only and not with any of the other factors, and yeah, I'm gonna win the cycling race.

512
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,598
Rym: It is also just fascinating.

513
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:13,230
Rym: looking at different kinds of cycling like Aerodynamics matters so much that like this like these are positions that one would use on a downhill, but Mountain biking like there's a set of different like styles and positions for downhill mountain biking.

514
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:15,200
Rym: They do not look anything like this.

515
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:18,404
Scott: because well if you're mountain biking It's about you know the.

516
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:19,070
Rym: it's about safe.

517
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:20,415
Rym: It's literally like.

518
00:36:20,455 --> 00:36:21,439
Rym: safety is the primary thing.

519
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,567
Rym: how fast can you go and maintain control?

520
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,330
Rym: so you're right?

521
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,454
Scott: It's you versus like.

522
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,061
Scott: there could be roots and rocks.

523
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,250
Scott: who knows what cut right whereas you're on a road.

524
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:29,734
Scott: It's like well.

525
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,165
Scott: It's not you versus the road.

526
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:34,337
Scott: anymore It's you know you're it's versus the people.

527
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:39,030
Rym: next like sometimes standing straight up is the fastest way to go down like with pedals.

528
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,945
Rym: They're neutral position sometimes like right leg down and like.

529
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:47,840
Rym: there's all these different positions You can go into but they optimize for safety because it's not.

530
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:49,926
Rym: are you faster because of wind resistance.

531
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:51,250
Rym: It's did you make it down?

532
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:54,059
Scott: Well, you could make it down.

533
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:54,240
Scott: It's.

534
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,367
Scott: did you make it down in one piece?

535
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:55,507
Scott: Yep?

536
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,643
Scott: two piece three piece.

537
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:02,130
Scott: Do I win if my torso gets over the finish line my legs are on the mountain?

538
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:04,857
Scott: What did my legs make?

539
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:17,269
Rym: I just imagined like the final form of initial D Where the engine just explodes and the car just goes flying down the mountain and lands upside down the end But then the person's skull falls out the window and rolls over the finish line.

540
00:37:19,132 --> 00:37:19,634
Rym: That's basic.

541
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:24,720
Rym: that's partly the end of redline skull on fire In the better moment.

542
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:25,770
Rym: yeah, we're stuck inside.

543
00:37:27,351 --> 00:37:28,235
Rym: Black lives matter.

544
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:29,500
Rym: donate money to the cause.

545
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:31,770
Rym: protest if you are safely able to do so.

546
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,030
Scott: I've started putting your highest priority.

547
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:41,290
Rym: Yep, I've started putting us our standalone anime reviews without the rest of the show on YouTube.

548
00:37:41,612 --> 00:37:44,150
Scott: So if you want to like is that cuz you ran out of board game ones?

549
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:49,868
Rym: yes, actually all of our board game ones except the ones that are so old that the audio quality is just awful.

550
00:37:49,888 --> 00:38:01,107
Rym: or It's a show where we like spent five minutes on ten different games, but pretty much every board game review We've ever done that was above a certain line of qualities on YouTube, so I've moved on to every anime review.

551
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:01,669
Rym: We've ever done?

552
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:06,625
Rym: Okay, so I got master Keaton up last night, and I'm gonna just keep going.

553
00:38:06,886 --> 00:38:07,949
Rym: that was a review we did in.

554
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,618
Scott: Well yep, how about that?

555
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,603
Rym: tale of Genji?

556
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:15,707
Rym: will read it at some point.

557
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:16,290
Rym: just stay tuned.

558
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,242
Rym: It's not reading season right now cuz we're stuck inside and working on stuff.

559
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:22,649
Rym: We are working on stuff so be ready for that.

560
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:40,108
Rym: We expect to present at the penny arcade expo online as our next convention because I do not think there's any other online Convention we're looking at presenting at before that and I don't think there will be any other conventions anytime soon, so Pax online it is I guess.

561
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:44,886
Rym: so Uh Yes, that's all I really got.

562
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:46,794
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

563
00:38:46,814 --> 00:38:49,142
Scott: It's Thursday all right, so it's the lounge.

564
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:50,909
Scott: We're gonna talk about some stationery.

565
00:38:53,272 --> 00:38:57,691
Scott: So right so I mean for as long as I've been going to school right cuz you know I grew up in it I got.

566
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:05,208
Scott: I don't know what kids are doing these days right, but when I grew up in school It's like yeah, I had a computer in kindergarten, but it was one apple two at the back of the classroom.

567
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:15,203
Rym: right yep Like either time it was fifth grade was the first time I like wrote as school essay on a computer instead of writing it by Hand even in middle school like they made us write shit by hand.

568
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,790
Scott: well like even in college.

569
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:20,342
Scott: You know it's like computer time was still like a separate time.

570
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:22,690
Scott: I would take my test on paper, right?

571
00:39:23,472 --> 00:39:24,779
Scott: I think now they're doing compute.

572
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:26,710
Scott: you would take your test on a computer for a lot of things.

573
00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:28,208
Rym: But yeah, I mean even RIT.

574
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:33,523
Scott: I did a lot of scan Tron tests and even today You know where I sit at a computer all day.

575
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:34,830
Scott: I still have notepads.

576
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:37,347
Scott: I still use pencils and pens and things to write.

577
00:39:37,548 --> 00:39:38,271
Scott: yeah Cuz it's.

578
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:44,610
Scott: it's often just faster and more convenient than say like opening notepad or whatever app them and making some notes.

579
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:53,490
Rym: Yeah, especially if I'm gonna take notes cuz when I take notes I tend to also do some diagrams, and I tend to structure my notes a little bit in some fashion.

580
00:39:54,671 --> 00:40:00,008
Rym: Hard to do that in like a notepad or something, but usually not worth the effort to get out the drawing tablet open.

581
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:01,573
Scott: mischief Right.

582
00:40:01,854 --> 00:40:03,745
Scott: I mean especially consider something like you know.

583
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:04,570
Scott: I'm looking at my computer.

584
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,555
Scott: There's an IP address.

585
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:05,797
Scott: Okay.

586
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:06,119
Scott: It's like well.

587
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:08,170
Scott: I can copy paste the IP address around the screen.

588
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:13,126
Scott: I don't need to write that down Yeah, but let's say I need to go type that IP address into a computer in the other room.

589
00:40:13,146 --> 00:40:14,652
Scott: all right It's like.

590
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:15,435
Scott: what am I gonna do?

591
00:40:15,756 --> 00:40:19,330
Scott: copy and paste it into like an app that I could open on my phone.

592
00:40:19,452 --> 00:40:21,533
Scott: I said to myself Text.

593
00:40:21,614 --> 00:40:22,919
Scott: it's like it's easier.

594
00:40:22,939 --> 00:40:25,790
Scott: a piece of paper still wins over a lot of things.

595
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,618
Scott: You can give a piece of paper to someone else.

596
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,530
Scott: right paper has still has that use.

597
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:33,550
Scott: I don't really think we still need printers.

598
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,381
Rym: I use my printer about once or twice a month.

599
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:40,090
Scott: is it to print out like RPG character sheet?

600
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,158
Rym: Yeah, that's 90% of what I do with it.

601
00:40:41,178 --> 00:40:50,410
Rym: occasionally I'll print out recipes even though I have a monitor on the HtPc in the like in the kitchen like around the corner so I can use the screen.

602
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:54,264
Rym: It's often easy to have something printed out and then if I spill stuff on it or whatever.

603
00:40:54,344 --> 00:40:55,087
Rym: like who cares?

604
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:59,315
Scott: I saw I did mix up recipe iPad iPad recipe for his paper recipe.

605
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:02,103
Rym: yep, there's pros and cons to both, but I'll do.

606
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:04,230
Scott: I read this regardless my whole life.

607
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,117
Scott: Right that I've used paper pens pencils right.

608
00:41:07,558 --> 00:41:13,014
Scott: I've really just sort of liked nice paper pens pencils Yeah, so even what?

609
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:23,470
Scott: so when I was when I would go actually it's like I didn't want to go back to school But when it was back to school season I really wanted to go to staples and buy some really nice school supplies.

610
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,564
Scott: Oh hell yeah, and I always want to use the nicest newest school supplies.

611
00:41:27,604 --> 00:41:30,614
Scott: as soon as like your pencil starts getting meh I wanted to use a newer pencil.

612
00:41:30,814 --> 00:41:35,890
Rym: Yeah, so elementary school in particular the school like had a lot of weird rules.

613
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,366
Rym: It was like this really strict Catholic school.

614
00:41:38,379 --> 00:41:41,720
Rym: They banned Mechanical pencils when I was in early elementary school.

615
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,447
Rym: like kids were not allowed to have a mechanical pencil.

616
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:48,165
Rym: you had to have Like a wooden pencil that could be pencil sharp in the normal way.

617
00:41:48,426 --> 00:41:52,299
Rym: it had to be a number two And they were weirdly strict about that.

618
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,950
Rym: like I remember a kid getting in trouble for having a mechanical pencil.

619
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,561
Rym: Alright, thankfully by the time.

620
00:41:58,601 --> 00:41:59,830
Rym: I got out of that Catholic school.

621
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:04,126
Rym: I never had to encounter that again because mechanical pencils are in my mind.

622
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,210
Rym: Just completely superior.

623
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,488
Rym: I never want to see a wooden pencil that I have to sharpen again in my life.

624
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:11,410
Scott: I mean I do like a mechanical pencil.

625
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:20,787
Rym: I hate using them because I have to keep sharpening them because I need a really sharp point or I'm Unhappy and I had to sharpen my pencils so often that it became a problem.

626
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:25,021
Scott: well So I was using mostly mechanical pencil.

627
00:42:25,081 --> 00:42:27,890
Scott: I even got to the point of buying a fancy drafting pencil.

628
00:42:28,051 --> 00:42:29,879
Rym: Oh, I still I use my.

629
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:35,608
Rym: I got it up my my unique or auto sharpening mechanical pencil.

630
00:42:35,628 --> 00:42:42,230
Scott: I Had a oto super Pro mecha drafting pencil when I found out about those and it was so fancy and nice.

631
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:49,081
Scott: And then it like it broke and I was like what the hell this is supposed to be a fancy $20 pencil as some bullshit right.

632
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:52,831
Rym: ah the unique or is only $10.

633
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:54,415
Scott: But now I've actually reverted.

634
00:42:54,435 --> 00:42:57,663
Scott: I'm now using fancy wooden pencil right.

635
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,012
Scott: so not only it's a fancy What is it called?

636
00:43:01,053 --> 00:43:01,575
Scott: It's called like the.

637
00:43:02,278 --> 00:43:02,660
Scott: where is it?

638
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:03,785
Scott: Where'd they go?

639
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:05,010
Scott: It's hiding on my desk.

640
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:05,754
Rym: Oh, well you look for that.

641
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:08,449
Rym: I guess my trouble with those is that mechanical pencils?

642
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:11,248
Rym: I remember almost every kid always used the point seven.

643
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:15,690
Rym: here It is it's hiding under the headphone, but point five millimeter was the most superior way.

644
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:18,278
Scott: So the pencil I have is.

645
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:19,323
Scott: I bought a whole box of these.

646
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:20,930
Scott: I have one box at home in one box at work.

647
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:23,229
Scott: It's the Palomino blackwing pencil.

648
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:30,132
Scott: It's a wooden pencil right it's but it's like extra nice wood extra nice Lead.

649
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:34,670
Scott: it has like this weird slogan on the side half the pressure twice the speed.

650
00:43:34,811 --> 00:43:35,718
Scott: I don't know what that's about.

651
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,997
Scott: it feels like a normal pencil to me And it has this giant eraser.

652
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:47,619
Scott: actually and as the eraser wears out you can pull out more eraser Like the pencil will run out before the eraser run.

653
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,361
Scott: alright alright.

654
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:58,295
Rym: I I can see I just saw on their website The sharpening implements that they have the well the best sharpener the long point No, no, no.

655
00:43:58,777 --> 00:44:01,207
Scott: is this the oh yeah automatic long point?

656
00:44:01,428 --> 00:44:04,517
Rym: the long point Long point solves a lot of the problems.

657
00:44:04,557 --> 00:44:08,029
Scott: I have with non-mechanical pencils this automatic long point sharpener.

658
00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:11,313
Scott: right It's a typical you know manual It's not.

659
00:44:11,353 --> 00:44:18,489
Scott: the crank pencil sharpener is the kind where you turn the pencil with your hand just a just a blade You know screwed into a to a thing with a hole in it right up.

660
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:21,198
Scott: But it has two holes number one and number two.

661
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,770
Scott: you sharpen the pencil in number one and number one.

662
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:25,954
Scott: I'll do it right now.

663
00:44:26,356 --> 00:44:29,930
Scott: Well only sharpen if anyone ever sees this video.

664
00:44:30,191 --> 00:44:33,746
Scott: Yeah, depending on the sharpened the wood right here.

665
00:44:33,766 --> 00:44:34,188
Scott: I'll hold it up.

666
00:44:35,991 --> 00:44:44,069
Scott: Only the wood has been sharpened and then in hole number two only The graphite is being sharpened by hole number two.

667
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:48,363
Rym: So I can write and write and write and then just and now this is how pointy.

668
00:44:48,865 --> 00:44:52,523
Scott: this is how pointy it gets Right after hole number two.

669
00:44:52,543 --> 00:44:55,810
Scott: It's a good point basically ridiculously pointy.

670
00:44:57,191 --> 00:45:02,267
Scott: And so yes, that's what I've been using as the blackwing pencil as what I've currently arrived at.

671
00:45:02,347 --> 00:45:05,820
Scott: but yeah historically I've used you know mechanical pencil.

672
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,450
Scott: like you know there were ones that had like a clicker on the side.

673
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:13,410
Scott: I never liked the ones where you would turn and now point in the front those always like unreliable.

674
00:45:13,632 --> 00:45:17,776
Scott: There's also the the classic Bic Mechanical yeah one.

675
00:45:17,977 --> 00:45:23,824
Rym: I use those for a long time especially in like middle school But I always got the 0.5 millimeter cuz 0.7. what I think?

676
00:45:24,486 --> 00:45:25,410
Scott: oh these are 0.7.

677
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:30,246
Scott: But I just I thought these that I didn't bought these at a drugstore because what these are?

678
00:45:30,286 --> 00:45:33,473
Scott: for the reason I have these RPGs RPG.

679
00:45:33,533 --> 00:45:34,778
Scott: you show up at an RPG.

680
00:45:34,838 --> 00:45:37,590
Scott: not everyone's gonna have pencils for the tabletop RPG.

681
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,157
Scott: So I just bring a hope.

682
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:42,050
Scott: I have a whole bunch of these just rubber banded together, and I plop them down.

683
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,603
Scott: I'm like boom everyone's got pencils.

684
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,228
Scott: there you go.

685
00:45:44,651 --> 00:45:49,890
Rym: Yeah, but I when I was older like now that I got more money because I was poor for a long time.

686
00:45:50,472 --> 00:46:03,990
Rym: I uh like I'd get the 0.5 millimeter Bix because they were good enough, and they were also really cheap, but Once I realized you could get mechanical pencils that rotate the lead as you click to keep them always relatively sharp.

687
00:46:04,492 --> 00:46:07,970
Rym: That was the revelation of my life, and that's why I'm basically using this pencil forever.

688
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:11,783
Scott: Mm-hmm all right, so let's go into pen land right.

689
00:46:11,843 --> 00:46:16,690
Scott: so what I was the first pens I remember using a lot were these erasable pen.

690
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:17,976
Rym: I use those two.

691
00:46:18,498 --> 00:46:21,270
Scott: we had those in elementary school, and I don't like my way.

692
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:22,818
Rym: I liked them, but they smudged a little bit.

693
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:24,868
Scott: They did smudge, but I like the way they smell.

694
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:33,409
Rym: yes They had this very specific smell I can I know like I can envision that smell in my brain knows They still make those even I don't know, but I like those.

695
00:46:34,353 --> 00:46:42,143
Scott: But then after that I would I switched over and I was really into these like Pens with superior ink or like these gel pens.

696
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:50,170
Rym: right well They still have a ball, but it's like gel is coming out right like it's a little wet after you're right for like a second.

697
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:55,207
Scott: I actually went back at one point and had this pen which is the pilot GX 300.

698
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:55,990
Scott: I still have one left.

699
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:02,690
Scott: They don't make these anymore right and it's just a normal ballpoint retractable pen, but the it's just like what's inside.

700
00:47:02,871 --> 00:47:05,869
Scott: It's a normal ass right just pen right.

701
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:19,104
Scott: There's nothing exciting about what the you know, but the ink they used in these was a little bit better than other pens And also this this case that you know the actual Plastic and the clicking mechanism and the hold of the pen itself.

702
00:47:19,726 --> 00:47:20,649
Scott: It was just really nice.

703
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:24,910
Scott: So I guess I still have one of these even though it's super old and not made anymore.

704
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:32,389
Rym: I like like the uniball like cheapo, whatever But I still I like the gel ink and I like the really really really fine point right.

705
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:42,062
Scott: so like I switched over to using you know I since they don't make those anymore right I was using more gel type pens right You know they're nice like I have this one here.

706
00:47:42,082 --> 00:47:43,450
Scott: This is from the Muji store.

707
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:50,050
Scott: It's like a point five green no green ink whatever right, so I'll still get the gel ones for like color situations.

708
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:57,850
Scott: But actually I've gone back to the regular normal ballpoint right, so this is from the Muji store also, right?

709
00:47:59,032 --> 00:48:00,479
Scott: And it's just a normal ballpoint pen.

710
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:04,535
Scott: right there's nothing interesting about it Really, it's so plain they.

711
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:09,910
Scott: but this one the ink that they put in these is like unbelievable, right?

712
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:13,710
Scott: It's like I kind of want to take the thing out of this pen and put it in that pilot thing.

713
00:48:14,272 --> 00:48:18,228
Scott: It's like it's like some sort of like you know oil some kind of ink like that.

714
00:48:18,308 --> 00:48:18,650
Scott: I don't know.

715
00:48:19,591 --> 00:48:25,354
Scott: It's just extra good ink like it gets so black and so nice-looking And so smooth.

716
00:48:25,835 --> 00:48:29,989
Scott: it's like this like just the comparison next to other ballpoint pens is like a day.

717
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:32,598
Scott: So in one hand to like an off-the-shelf whatever.

718
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:42,950
Rym: I use pencils almost exclusively like I really only use pens Now like as of the last year or so when I'm signing things But very rarely if I'm just taking notes through my day-to-day stuff.

719
00:48:43,452 --> 00:48:46,687
Rym: But I used to always think oh well pencil like I can erase it.

720
00:48:46,707 --> 00:48:47,290
Rym: so that makes sense.

721
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:52,190
Rym: But I realized I almost never erase anything I ever write with a pencil.

722
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:58,007
Rym: I'll still just cross things out like the eraser is used so rarely that I basically treat pencils like pens now.

723
00:48:58,589 --> 00:48:59,070
Scott: Yeah, it's weird.

724
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:03,370
Scott: It's like even though the pencil has an eraser, and I use that I do have a separate eraser.

725
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:05,679
Rym: Yeah, cuz the separate eraser is just better usually.

726
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:14,650
Scott: yeah last longer like better coverage No less dandy like these blackwing pencils have these giant erasers in them that you can keep pulling out more and more eraser.

727
00:49:14,934 --> 00:49:15,850
Scott: Why do I have separate?

728
00:49:17,031 --> 00:49:18,122
Scott: Right I don't know.

729
00:49:18,243 --> 00:49:18,789
Scott: I just have it.

730
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:23,280
Scott: But yeah, so for a weird.

731
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,429
Scott: that like you know it's like I had you know a bad ballpoint pen And I was like a ballpoint pen is meh, and I ran away from it.

732
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:45,299
Scott: Yeah, and I went back, and it's like no actually I like ballpoint pen the most you know even when I remember I think one time I was it when I graduated elementary school I think you know me and my cousins my grandmother got us all these Parker pens Which I guess must have cost like 50 bucks or something.

733
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:48,270
Scott: they were like fancy metal pens where you would twist them to get the?

734
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:56,408
Scott: the ball to point to come out right and They had like my name engraved on the side of it.

735
00:49:56,428 --> 00:50:05,190
Scott: and You know the it didn't have a normal You know like springy ink thing in there you to get a special ink thing from Parker.

736
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:08,903
Scott: Yeah, go into the fancy pen right Parker is sort of like.

737
00:50:09,164 --> 00:50:10,910
Scott: I don't know if they even still exist anymore.

738
00:50:11,072 --> 00:50:11,700
Rym: Oh, yeah, they do.

739
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:14,437
Scott: I'm on their website Okay, but it's like you know.

740
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:17,266
Scott: Mont Blanc is like fancy pen right by the way.

741
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,792
Scott: I've never liked fountain pen I've never.

742
00:50:18,812 --> 00:50:19,635
Scott: it's like.

743
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:24,156
Scott: I just always seemed like a pretentious thing like hard to write with I don't know what the advantage.

744
00:50:24,196 --> 00:50:31,185
Scott: good pen up an island is still around - oh, yeah The Parker pen is I guess sort of just like a cheap right.

745
00:50:31,225 --> 00:50:34,382
Scott: it's like fancy pen But not as expensive as Mont Blanc pen right.

746
00:50:34,403 --> 00:50:44,299
Scott: It's just like a fancy brand Whatever, but you know that pen you know I thought it was fancy right, but actually thinking back to it It's like that ink just got all over the place.

747
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,930
Scott: Yeah, it was just like it wasn't good the worst.

748
00:50:47,593 --> 00:50:54,284
Rym: Oh, I know if you have someone does calligraphy of course like you need a fountain pen Or you need those markers that have the edge right.

749
00:50:54,404 --> 00:50:57,655
Rym: yeah, you know I Hate fountain pens.

750
00:50:57,695 --> 00:50:59,281
Rym: They're just a pain in the ass.

751
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:00,244
Scott: That's I'm saying.

752
00:51:00,284 --> 00:51:01,810
Scott: I don't understand what the obsession is.

753
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:05,150
Scott: It's like yeah, okay, you got the skills to use one, but like what's the advantage of it?

754
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:05,912
Rym: You know what it's like.

755
00:51:05,973 --> 00:51:10,290
Rym: It's like shaving with a straight razor like yeah, that's cool, but you can get a shave.

756
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,822
Rym: That's 99% is good with a safety razor and right exactly.

757
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:14,264
Scott: It's like.

758
00:51:14,726 --> 00:51:15,930
Scott: it's like yeah, I agree them.

759
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:19,430
Scott: It's like you know Mach 5 those cartridge razors bullshit.

760
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:20,394
Scott: Let's get away from that.

761
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:22,804
Scott: You know garbage right, and it's like okay.

762
00:51:22,824 --> 00:51:22,965
Scott: Well.

763
00:51:23,065 --> 00:51:24,250
Scott: I've wrapped at the safety razor.

764
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,539
Scott: It's like no they're going to the straight razor.

765
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,038
Scott: It's like why it's like you're adding this danger Yeah, and that you're not really gaining right.

766
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,171
Scott: I'm gaining a lot versus that Mach 3. what a safety Here's.

767
00:51:34,272 --> 00:51:41,707
Rym: here's the thing like if I want someone who is a calligraphy expert to calligraphy for me I they should use the fancy fountain pen.

768
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:51,130
Rym: that'll make it Obviously, but I'm talking about the pretend, but just like a little barbershop Fountain pen for everything all the time like if I go to a barbershop to get a shave yeah use the straight razor.

769
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:53,907
Rym: I'm paying the expert to give me that extra 1% better shave.

770
00:51:56,711 --> 00:52:01,590
Rym: But exactly in the modern world I don't write things down like anything.

771
00:52:01,711 --> 00:52:10,406
Rym: I write down is either on a role-playing game character sheet or Or I'm signing my name on something or I'm taking notes.

772
00:52:10,426 --> 00:52:11,210
Rym: They're all ephemeral.

773
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:21,913
Rym: I don't write anything with my hands that is meant to be anything But an ephemeral temporary like note to be discarded once I either digitize it or take care of whatever it is I wrote down.

774
00:52:22,656 --> 00:52:24,766
Scott: I might write a card or a letter.

775
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:31,588
Scott: Rarely yeah, but it's very rare definitely rarely super rare.

776
00:52:33,035 --> 00:52:42,162
Rym: And also I can type Even like I know shorthand like you've seen my awful handwriting cuz I learned like I can write in like full-on Shorthand that only I can read.

777
00:52:42,222 --> 00:52:43,390
Rym: or someone who like those shorthand.

778
00:52:43,892 --> 00:52:47,144
Rym: But I can type so much faster than I can write.

779
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:51,519
Rym: I can type so much faster Yeah Like if I have to write more than a sentence it would be.

780
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:54,650
Scott: the difference is the difference is that even if I'm using my?

781
00:52:54,790 --> 00:53:03,917
Scott: Magic pencil on my iPad right which would theoretically give you complete freedom to write anything Yeah, still gonna take for some for some reason.

782
00:53:04,058 --> 00:53:11,154
Scott: It's like writing with a pencil on a paper is somehow still more free and less Restrictive than yeah.

783
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:11,757
Rym: well because there's.

784
00:53:11,797 --> 00:53:16,314
Rym: no that the the canvas you've got whatever whatever it is That's it And you just work around it.

785
00:53:16,354 --> 00:53:17,579
Rym: like when I write and take notes.

786
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:28,230
Rym: the reason I like to use pencils for that purpose is that I'll kind of write notes And I'll structure and I'll jump around in the document and diagrams appear and I'll have arrows right as much as the digital brush.

787
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:29,214
Scott: The.

788
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:35,263
Scott: you know that the computer software has built into it as vastly improved And it's like it looks like a real pencil.

789
00:53:35,324 --> 00:53:36,229
Scott: Holy shit, right?

790
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:43,658
Scott: There's still something that's hard to describe but like you know it's like It's just this.

791
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,770
Scott: it's like you don't have the same freedom.

792
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:52,150
Scott: Just write whatever when you're using the magic even with magic pencil on iPad pro in the fancy notes app.

793
00:53:52,471 --> 00:53:55,280
Scott: Yeah, still it's still missing something.

794
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:01,460
Rym: it cannot replace real pencil on real paper And I don't think this will go away for the foreseeable future.

795
00:54:01,481 --> 00:54:08,010
Rym: like in my free quarantine my black life I go to a lot of meetings, and there's takeaways from those meetings.

796
00:54:08,171 --> 00:54:13,210
Rym: I got to remember stuff to do later and making notes is the thing I'm gonna be doing for the foreseeable future.

797
00:54:13,672 --> 00:54:16,141
Rym: Even something simple like remember to do the thing.

798
00:54:16,583 --> 00:54:18,430
Rym: it's way easier just to write.

799
00:54:18,772 --> 00:54:21,530
Scott: I just went to the grocery right now right and I needed four things.

800
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:25,845
Scott: I wrote them down on a pad really quick tore the paper and walked out yep to open.

801
00:54:25,865 --> 00:54:34,650
Scott: I could have opened my phone gone To like Google Keep or the notes app typed in the four things Right and then looked at my phone in the grocery and saved a piece of paper.

802
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,390
Scott: But that even it's like it's actually slower.

803
00:54:38,211 --> 00:54:39,318
Scott: Yeah, it's like you.

804
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:42,675
Scott: a computer is all about making things Faster right.

805
00:54:42,716 --> 00:54:43,520
Scott: you know Steve Jobs.

806
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:45,130
Scott: It's a bicycle for the mind right.

807
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:51,910
Scott: It's like if it's not making the work faster and easier than why why using the computer yep?

808
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:55,230
Rym: I like I use a computer if I'm gonna type a diatribe or a screed.

809
00:54:56,151 --> 00:55:01,281
Rym: Yeah, I'm not gonna write my manifesto by hand, but I'll write my note to remember to do the thing Mm-hmm.

810
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,524
Scott: So last thing I'll say about paper right.

811
00:55:05,007 --> 00:55:07,736
Scott: so Obviously in school.

812
00:55:07,757 --> 00:55:09,930
Scott: I was using like you know three ring binder.

813
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:16,494
Rym: You get you get college ruled even though the school wanted to use wide ruled as even as a little kid I was always like college ruled.

814
00:55:16,554 --> 00:55:19,064
Scott: only I would get like this recycled paper.

815
00:55:19,084 --> 00:55:20,530
Scott: That was like gray right.

816
00:55:21,233 --> 00:55:25,190
Scott: It's all soft and squishy because it worked really well with those erasable pencil.

817
00:55:26,411 --> 00:55:35,705
Scott: I'd always get like the mead like college ruled binder book of paper and use that you could get the note the notebook that with The black and white sort of garbly mess on the.

818
00:55:35,926 --> 00:55:36,830
Scott: you know the ones I'm talking about.

819
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:38,957
Rym: I know exactly I picture it in my mind.

820
00:55:39,017 --> 00:55:41,806
Scott: I had it right or the spiral notebook right.

821
00:55:41,826 --> 00:55:44,777
Scott: that was a solid color on the front Yeah, but I got the major.

822
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:45,882
Rym: I got the ones with the perforations.

823
00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:50,636
Scott: I could tear pages out right You know and it's like you know.

824
00:55:50,797 --> 00:55:54,048
Scott: nice those those papers are okay, but it's like you know.

825
00:55:54,088 --> 00:55:58,322
Scott: later in life I discovered wait a minute this fancy paper because we spray fancy paper.

826
00:55:58,342 --> 00:55:59,646
Scott: Just wasn't accessible right.

827
00:55:59,686 --> 00:56:01,115
Scott: It's like we didn't kids know.

828
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:10,869
Scott: Right now I can go to like Kino Kunia or the Muji store and get like Japanese paper But I find increasingly I don't or I can buy moleskine.

829
00:56:11,372 --> 00:56:19,109
Rym: I did the little thing for a while like I'd carry him around and like I'd use like a notepad I just carried in my pocket, and I could just bust it out any meeting and keep notes.

830
00:56:19,692 --> 00:56:28,290
Rym: But as time goes on I just use literally whatever paper Like yeah anywhere like I just find some papers somewhere.

831
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:32,277
Rym: Maybe I even literally pull it out of a printer And that's just what I use like it.

832
00:56:32,317 --> 00:56:35,409
Scott: well it I have the same problem with with you know?

833
00:56:35,489 --> 00:56:35,629
Scott: not?

834
00:56:35,649 --> 00:56:38,369
Scott: you know I had the problem a little bit with the yout with the writing utensils.

835
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:44,630
Scott: But I have the problem big time with the papers and notebooks is that they're a lot like items in a JRPG.

836
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:48,805
Scott: Yeah, I really covet that fit that elixir.

837
00:56:49,226 --> 00:56:50,130
Scott: I covered it and I buy it.

838
00:56:50,571 --> 00:56:56,049
Scott: It's like oh look at that fancy notebook yoink, but then oh is the square boss worth it should I?

839
00:56:56,109 --> 00:56:56,410
Scott: it's like?

840
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:56,792
Scott: It's like.

841
00:56:57,094 --> 00:56:57,355
Scott: it's like.

842
00:56:57,476 --> 00:56:59,186
Scott: what will I use this notebook for?

843
00:56:59,266 --> 00:57:00,614
Scott: I have these Notebooks.

844
00:57:00,674 --> 00:57:01,357
Scott: what it's like.

845
00:57:01,538 --> 00:57:03,488
Scott: I got them from make magazine when that was still it.

846
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:06,995
Scott: I think they're out of business now right they had like makers notebook right.

847
00:57:07,376 --> 00:57:11,958
Scott: so I bought two makers notebooks that are ultra fancy and I started to use one.

848
00:57:11,978 --> 00:57:15,997
Scott: the other ones never been used in the first one I barely used right because it's like.

849
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:16,940
Scott: you know.

850
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,602
Scott: is it?

851
00:57:17,702 --> 00:57:19,749
Scott: is this worthy of the makers notebook?

852
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:20,029
Scott: right?

853
00:57:20,049 --> 00:57:20,210
Scott: whatever?

854
00:57:21,154 --> 00:57:27,222
Rym: So what I do at my work What really changed my habits finally was we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of conference rooms.

855
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:39,625
Rym: every conference room has in it a big pile of pre-sharpened pencils just in case you need them and a Giant pile of like 20 page notepads that are small no cover.

856
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:41,270
Rym: Just like really simple nice paper.

857
00:57:41,754 --> 00:57:43,390
Scott: We like what you get in a hotel conference.

858
00:57:43,601 --> 00:57:45,881
Rym: Yeah But with a few and but there's always a bunch of varieties.

859
00:57:45,901 --> 00:57:53,413
Rym: like some have square some have Like a checkerboard pattern some have hexes some have lines and They're just there.

860
00:57:53,735 --> 00:57:55,501
Rym: and what I find is any meeting I go to.

861
00:57:55,522 --> 00:57:57,570
Rym: I inevitably didn't bring anything with me.

862
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,784
Rym: I grab one of those notepads.

863
00:57:59,824 --> 00:58:03,203
Rym: I take my notes on it I carry it back with them in my desk, and I throw it down.

864
00:58:03,223 --> 00:58:04,530
Rym: you go to another meeting later.

865
00:58:04,992 --> 00:58:07,622
Rym: I write notes on a brand new notepad by the end of the week.

866
00:58:07,662 --> 00:58:11,008
Rym: I've got 12 notepads on my desk And you know what I do.

867
00:58:11,552 --> 00:58:15,997
Rym: I pull the top two or three pages off of each one where I wrote stuff and I do a Reconciliation right.

868
00:58:16,017 --> 00:58:16,682
Rym: look and see.

869
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:18,977
Rym: is there anything on this paper I need to still deal with?

870
00:58:19,399 --> 00:58:27,486
Rym: then I take all the notepads that are missing a few pages And I just go sneak into a conference room on Friday before I leave and I put them all in the pile And I walk away.

871
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:30,670
Scott: Right it's like you buy the notebook with the fancy paper.

872
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,481
Scott: It's like is this worthy of the fancy paper?

873
00:58:32,502 --> 00:58:33,810
Scott: you end up writing all my notes.

874
00:58:33,991 --> 00:58:36,522
Scott: It's like I bought this fancy paper because it's so nice to write out.

875
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,170
Scott: end up writing notes on all the shitty pad.

876
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:39,557
Rym: Yeah, is it sponge worthy?

877
00:58:39,577 --> 00:58:42,090
Scott: because it's like I don't care for right on that one.

878
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:48,535
Rym: What I want to start doing when we get back into doing RPGs in person is Any all the fancy notebooks.

879
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:50,242
Rym: I've collected over the years every time.

880
00:58:50,262 --> 00:58:51,166
Rym: There's a big RPG.

881
00:58:51,186 --> 00:58:52,290
Rym: This is gonna go on for a while.

882
00:58:52,753 --> 00:58:55,650
Rym: I'm just gonna take my notes in that book just page by page.

883
00:58:56,452 --> 00:58:58,304
Scott: See that's what I always think is like each little.

884
00:58:58,445 --> 00:59:02,730
Scott: each tiny notebook I have I have like four or five was for a different purpose, right?

885
00:59:03,112 --> 00:59:04,170
Scott: It's like I have a netrunner one.

886
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:07,950
Scott: Yeah, I wrote all my netrunner stuff in and it's like I didn't finish it.

887
00:59:08,191 --> 00:59:08,676
Scott: But it's like.

888
00:59:08,756 --> 00:59:10,249
Scott: and now it's got a lot of pages in it.

889
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,740
Scott: It's still a perfectly good notebook, but it's like.

890
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,005
Scott: am I gonna put something on?

891
00:59:14,046 --> 00:59:15,070
Scott: that netrunner is done.

892
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,479
Scott: So what do I do with that?

893
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,707
Scott: just leave this, you know?

894
00:59:17,707 --> 00:59:19,414
Scott: 80% unused.

895
00:59:19,896 --> 00:59:25,860
Rym: I say good put a bookmark in it and like when the world starts up again And we play like a blades in the dark game in Queens.

896
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,769
Rym: use that for your blades in the dark game.

897
00:59:28,353 --> 00:59:28,958
Scott: Yeah, but it's like.

898
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:29,401
Scott: but it's like.

899
00:59:29,462 --> 00:59:36,510
Scott: it just feels me Unorganized and like have two purposes in the same, you know, it's like going one way and now I'm doing another thing.

900
00:59:37,312 --> 00:59:39,359
Rym: Leave you it'll leave you an artifact.

901
00:59:39,379 --> 00:59:40,161
Rym: So years later.

902
00:59:40,422 --> 00:59:42,930
Rym: You'll have a notebook where you're like, hey, what the fuck's this notebook?

903
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:47,650
Rym: And you'll see hey my netrunner notes and then oh that blades in the dark game.

904
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:50,180
Rym: I played with Rym and then after that, it's like oh that other RPG.

905
00:59:50,220 --> 01:00:00,395
Scott: I played with Joey Joe, but I already have Several such notebooks for different things and they're each single purpose and they're each only like not even 10% used Right.

906
01:00:00,899 --> 01:00:02,450
Rym: Well, the problem is for RPGs.

907
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:11,841
Rym: I tend to just keep a Google Doc for each RPG and keep adding to it and Even just have a laptop if I'm at the RPG to type notes in.

908
01:00:12,062 --> 01:00:18,629
Scott: so I think what I'm gonna do though is I'm not buying I have you know written off buying any more and what I'll do yourself to use them.

909
01:00:19,132 --> 01:00:47,968
Scott: I'll force to use all the ones I have because they do have nice papers in them Which is you know, ultra nice and very compatible with the pens and pencils that I've chosen right out ultra smooth and comfortable And I can't really see much improvement in that department, yep I'm gonna use them until they're all done Right, but next when I do eventually buy more notebook when they're all full I'm gonna buy ones where I can tear the pages out because all them all the ones I have now are ones who you can't Really remove the pages nicely.

910
01:00:49,393 --> 01:00:56,220
Scott: And if I could remove the pages then I could for example remove all the netrunner pages Right and then not feel bad.

911
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:08,650
Scott: I'd almost feel like I have a brand new notebook ready to roll right, ah So I'm gonna get page removable ones In the future whenever that distant future is when I use up all this freaking paper.

912
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:24,290
Rym: Yeah, the problem is right now because this this Podcast we're recording is a moment in time in the middle of the biggest global pandemic in contemporary history because I don't go anywhere I don't write anything down anymore because I'm always at my computer if I'm doing anything.

913
01:01:25,193 --> 01:01:30,010
Scott: Oh, I still have this pad next to my computer, which is it's actually a post-it pad.

914
01:01:30,111 --> 01:01:37,010
Scott: It's like it's kind of long and has lines on it, but these are sticky Right and I use that for almost everything but my work.

915
01:01:37,171 --> 01:01:39,101
Rym: I guess my head my trouble is my work.

916
01:01:39,584 --> 01:01:49,368
Rym: all my work stuff is Like I don't need because I'm not going to meetings anymore like the work environment So different that I just have one long notepad doc that I can't call my notes in see.

917
01:01:49,428 --> 01:01:49,850
Scott: at work.

918
01:01:50,111 --> 01:01:54,081
Scott: I had some some Muji notebooks that were extra thin right.

919
01:01:54,121 --> 01:02:01,270
Scott: they were all like books right and actually at work I used them up like I actually finished them at work because that's a single.

920
01:02:01,391 --> 01:02:05,750
Scott: They didn't have that many pages in them right, but it's like yeah, you know it's like at work.

921
01:02:05,911 --> 01:02:07,458
Scott: They're single-purpose up there.

922
01:02:07,499 --> 01:02:08,745
Scott: They sit on my desk at work.

923
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:09,730
Scott: They don't write.

924
01:02:11,071 --> 01:02:12,916
Scott: So there's no worrying about.

925
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:13,598
Scott: you know work.

926
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:18,232
Scott: unless I get fired or something right and if I get fired or I quit I leave Them at work.

927
01:02:18,292 --> 01:02:18,593
Scott: I don't.

928
01:02:18,613 --> 01:02:27,490
Scott: it's like yeah, these are yours, but we had a training at work, and I was given This moleskine that is a big blank white pages.

929
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:32,330
Scott: So I've been since I got that at work, and I finished all the Muji ones at work.

930
01:02:32,853 --> 01:02:36,643
Scott: I'm just using this now because it was given to me for free for work only.

931
01:02:36,663 --> 01:02:41,368
Scott: so When that finishes then I guess I'll have to buy something new for work only.

932
01:02:41,388 --> 01:02:45,070
Rym: yep Well, we'll see if I ever even go back to an office.

933
01:02:45,932 --> 01:02:47,766
Scott: That's also true, but you know the thing.

934
01:02:47,786 --> 01:02:50,259
Scott: the last thing I just want to say is that you know the fancy paper.

935
01:02:51,022 --> 01:02:52,027
Scott: you know it's like you know.

936
01:02:52,188 --> 01:02:55,543
Scott: as nerds We're always fascinated by like Japanese stuff right.

937
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,326
Scott: It's such a nerd.

938
01:02:56,346 --> 01:03:00,036
Scott: you know It's somewhat racist American nerd.

939
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:04,750
Rym: weaves are really into Japanese type thing even if they're not into anime right.

940
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,196
Scott: But I just can't it.

941
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:11,899
Scott: despite it being stereotyped or whatever you want to say I don't know what the paper is like in other countries.

942
01:03:11,939 --> 01:03:16,329
Scott: there might be countries with even better paper than Japan right But I just don't have access to that paper.

943
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:25,165
Scott: But for some reason Japanese paper is just way nicer even It's not even just the paper and like notebooks and stationery right.

944
01:03:26,008 --> 01:03:34,852
Scott: if I buy Gundams and have them delivered from Japan the cardboard box They're delivered in is nicer and smoother and not as rough Right.

945
01:03:34,953 --> 01:03:36,538
Scott: it doesn't have as much like a you.

946
01:03:36,558 --> 01:03:40,150
Scott: a United States cardboard box from like Amazon is like the corrugation.

947
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:45,292
Scott: It's just sort of like it's scratchy right whereas the box the Gundams come in It's like it's.

948
01:03:45,312 --> 01:03:47,342
Scott: so it's like it just feels nicer.

949
01:03:47,403 --> 01:03:48,709
Scott: the aesthetic of it is like.

950
01:03:49,353 --> 01:04:00,160
Rym: You know the the same way that like oh it depends though like I got my GoPro And it like it was in the Amazon box, but inside of it Well like was another box and that box was super nice.

951
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:05,927
Scott: paper right right, but I'm talking about the the brown Cardboard not the like.

952
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:06,812
Scott: Like.

953
01:04:06,832 --> 01:04:11,530
Scott: you buy a ground card by an iPhone right it's like the iPhone technically comes in a cardboard box.

954
01:04:11,751 --> 01:04:14,845
Scott: I think right it's sort of plasticky a little bit, but it's like that what you know.

955
01:04:14,866 --> 01:04:31,485
Scott: the Cardboard Apple's using for the actual product is extra fancy, but I'm like the outer shipping box is So nice like the one you're gonna recycle like right And it's like it's just the paper that they use for everything.

956
01:04:31,846 --> 01:04:32,810
Scott: so nice like there.

957
01:04:33,232 --> 01:04:40,978
Scott: It's like they talk about how their manga paper is so cheap, but it's like actually What is their paper making technology do they do?

958
01:04:40,998 --> 01:04:45,250
Scott: they just care more about the the aesthetic of the the paper right I?

959
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,337
Rym: Don't know yeah, but the hard part is something about.

960
01:04:48,397 --> 01:04:51,950
Rym: I don't know much about paper beyond like the minimum.

961
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,296
Scott: I don't know anything about the paper.

962
01:04:53,336 --> 01:05:00,825
Scott: I just know that like if I buy I understand paper weight Would you or yeah if I buy paper and stationary from a Japanese company?

963
01:05:00,885 --> 01:05:01,507
Scott: It's just nicer.

964
01:05:01,608 --> 01:05:02,170
Scott: That's all I know.

965
01:05:03,311 --> 01:05:10,470
Scott: And when I go to Staples if I go to the Kinokuniya store or Muji to buy stationary all the stuff is super nice And it's super smooth.

966
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:13,605
Rym: We got to do a double-blind trial to see if this is just.

967
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:16,200
Scott: if I go to if I go to Staples to buy some paper.

968
01:05:16,261 --> 01:05:20,758
Rym: It's always me right When the world opens up, let's do a double-blind trial.

969
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:26,758
Rym: I'll get some Muji paper some staples paper, and we're gonna see All right, so I guess actually not a bad idea.

970
01:05:26,818 --> 01:05:27,240
Rym: They'll be good.

971
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,545
