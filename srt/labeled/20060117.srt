00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,217
Rym: It's Tuesday January 17th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:24,538
Rym: tonight We nominally talk about Mario and Luigi partners in time and Ultima quest of the avatar But we also spend more time than you think arguing about the latest Supreme Court decision in Gonzalez vs.

3
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:24,920
Rym: Oregon.

4
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:26,858
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:32,400
Scott: So you might have noticed today that I screwed up the forums a little bit and there might have been some downtime or whatever.

6
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:34,700
Rym: Yeah, everyone lost their avatars.

7
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:37,349
Scott: Well, only people who uploaded avatars lost them.

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,300
Scott: people who had their avatars on another website did not lose them.

9
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:42,900
Rym: I don't think anyone has their avatar on another site.

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,449
Scott: I think one person did actually but that it does.

11
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:46,071
Scott: that's not the point.

12
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:51,948
Scott: The point is there was a Potential security threat to the forum.

13
00:00:52,109 --> 00:01:00,736
Scott: So I attempted to upgrade it to a newer version and in the process I accidentally overwrote the images directory which had all the little icons in it.

14
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:06,684
Scott: Yeah So, oops, my bad Nothing else is hurt.

15
00:01:06,744 --> 00:01:11,018
Scott: Just go re-upload your avatars and everything will be back to normal.

16
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:18,980
Rym: Yep I mean we did it for your own good because basically we built another site on the same host for another group out there.

17
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:36,192
Rym: we talked about a little bit and we put the same kind of blog and forum over there and I was logged into that forum Testing it and then I go log into the GeekNights forum and I discover that I am in fact logged into the GeekNights forum as Someone else one of our fine listeners.

18
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:40,670
Scott: Yes the whale shark Yeah, so there was basically a sort of.

19
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:48,600
Scott: they usually call it a cross site scripting attack But it's not really cross site because it was the same site with the same piece of software running two times.

20
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:52,160
Rym: It was like a cross hash cookie PHP session exploit.

21
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:54,986
Scott: I don't know what it was But it wasn't the guy.

22
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:58,280
Scott: I wrote to the people who make the forum and they said it was really a configuration error.

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,990
Scott: That isn't an issue anymore with the newer newer newer version that we're not gonna use yet because it's still beta But we'll use that version when it's no longer beta.

24
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:08,039
Scott: The point is is that it's solved now.

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,492
Rym: I mean basically all I could have done is someone could have logged in as you but no one knew about it and we fixed It before anyone found out.

26
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:17,535
Scott: Yep So it's all good.

27
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:25,099
Scott: Re-upload your avatars and if you're not in the forum go there because I put a secret there.

28
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:27,429
Rym: You didn't put shit.

29
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:28,800
Scott: Oh, really?

30
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,087
Scott: Yeah, really now this secrets there.

31
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:33,151
Rym: what secrets?

32
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:36,160
Rym: I was just there a second ago secrets to make people go there.

33
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:39,480
Rym: Yeah, so it means you're gonna add a secret after the show while I'm doing post-production.

34
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,832
Scott: No, I already added a secret, but I'll add it something more obvious later.

35
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:43,314
Scott: Uh-huh.

36
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:52,333
Rym: So anyway, we actually have a lot a bit of a non geek news But it's a topic that we're real riled up about.

37
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:58,120
Rym: so we figured we'd talk about it Since people seem to like here in our opinions and or us yelling at each other yelling.

38
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:03,744
Rym: But as you're all probably aware the Supreme Court ruled today in Gonzalez vs.

39
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:25,198
Rym: Oregon that and this is the majority opinion that the DEA and the Attorney General's ban of assisted suicide a Federal mandate Violated the Constitution in the sense that it overrode an Oregon state law saying that assisted suicide is okay and the doctors can do it if they follow a procedure and the patient wants them to.

40
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:28,660
Scott: In other words, it was a vote in favor of states rights.

41
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:41,075
Rym: yes in favor of states rights in favor of a right to die in favor of limiting the power of the executive branch and It was just really a really interesting ruling and I guess we'll try to explain why.

42
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:51,599
Scott: for those of you who aren't big SCOTUS followers, yeah, so what's really cool about this is That it was six to three, I think right?

43
00:03:51,828 --> 00:04:00,840
Rym: Yep So even if someone like when O'Connor steps down and Scalito probably gets in It wouldn't have changed the result because he's almost definitely gonna dissent on this opinion.

44
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:04,454
Scott: The next thing that it's important to note is the three people who voted against.

45
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,260
Scott: it were Roberts Scalia and Thomas Thomas.

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,848
Rym: Now those three claim to be conservative.

47
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:12,253
Scott: they say they're conservatives yet.

48
00:04:12,273 --> 00:04:13,880
Scott: They voted against states rights.

49
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,891
Scott: Now if that's not the opposite of conservative, I don't know what is.

50
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:19,320
Rym: I mean basically a little background on this case.

51
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:29,273
Rym: I think it was in 1996 or 97 that Oregon passed a law saying that if someone's terminally ill and Doctors verify that there is no way to help them.

52
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:30,420
Rym: They're in pain.

53
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:33,994
Scott: I think they had to be like going definitely going to die within six months.

54
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,038
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

55
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:38,540
Rym: Yeah Like a doctor has to say this person will be dead within six months.

56
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,100
Rym: They're in pain blah blah blah and a psychologist to evaluate the person and all these rules to make sure that this isn't abused.

57
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:48,520
Rym: Then a person can go through all this and request a doctor to painlessly end their life.

58
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,020
Rym: It was called the dying with dignity act.

59
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:52,224
Scott: Actually, it's even.

60
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:53,548
Scott: it's even less than that.

61
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,173
Scott: The doctor doesn't even end your life.

62
00:04:55,233 --> 00:05:05,420
Scott: The doctor will prescribe to you pain-killing medication and You have to go get that prescription filled and then take enough of it to kill yourself.

63
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:11,839
Rym: In fact, if you're too weak, if you're too weak to do it, they'll set up a device that'll do it But you have to make the final call and push the button.

64
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:15,250
Scott: Yeah, so it's like the doctor doesn't even do it.

65
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:22,347
Scott: The doctor just sort of it's like someone saying alright You're not allowed to buy a gun.

66
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:28,036
Scott: So I'm gonna write a piece of paper that says you're allowed to buy a gun and You can shoot yourself with it if you want to.

67
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:36,647
Rym: I know what it was called the dying with dignity act and regardless of your feelings on right to die or suicide Even though we're very opinionated about it.

68
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,340
Rym: The fact remains that this was voted into law by the majority of voters.

69
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,399
Rym: I believe it was a referendum in Oregon and most people in the state agreed with it.

70
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:56,631
Rym: so doctors started doing this and Back then a bunch of Republican senators like Orrin Hatch that bastard Got together and decided that they didn't like this.

71
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:59,280
Rym: they didn't like the fact that people could kill themselves legally.

72
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,378
Scott: Why don't you mind your own business and then to do with you?

73
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:09,163
Rym: So they went over to Janet Reno and told her to intervene and Janet Reno gave him the finger and said that's the stupidest thing Ever.

74
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:10,254
Rym: it'd be unconstitutional.

75
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:14,447
Rym: Leave me alone Mm-hmm, so Nothing could happen.

76
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:15,814
Scott: Yeah, that's forward.

77
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:24,633
Scott: and a side note I want to point out that pretty much almost everything in Oregon is a referendum Which means the people actually vote on all their lot most of their laws.

78
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:26,560
Rym: Yeah, it's not a really cool place.

79
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:28,380
Rym: I didn't really know much about it until recently.

80
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,302
Scott: Yeah, like an election day they get like these huge books full of stuff and they have to go through and fill out all this Crap, like yes.

81
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:35,165
Scott: No, maybe yes.

82
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:40,937
Scott: No, maybe it's really cool there as opposed to other places where your state government does Whatever you don't know.

83
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:44,780
Rym: I mean, it's a mixed bag because sometimes people don't really know what's best.

84
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:52,560
Scott: But at least the people of Oregon know exactly what they're getting into Mm-hmm, and this is something that they definitely voted for in a vast majority.

85
00:06:53,464 --> 00:07:01,479
Rym: so fast forward to recently Bush is now president and Gonzalez slash Ashcroft our attorneys general and such.

86
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:13,940
Rym: now There's a clause in the the controlled substances act Which is that it's basically the thing that they use that and the commerce clause to make drugs illegal federally.

87
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:16,007
Rym: So things like marijuana and all that

88
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:16,689
Scott: cocaine

89
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:31,780
Rym: and the drugs that were used by doctors To administer this death to people who requested it were scheduled to drugs Meaning that they're illegal unless prescribed by a doctor and the legal way to prescribe them is to go through the CSA.

90
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:39,560
Rym: Now Ashcroft said oh well considering that the CSA says all these blah blah blah.

91
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:55,600
Rym: If you actually give people these drugs to kill themselves killing themselves is not a valid use of that drug and therefore what that doctor is doing is illegal and Irrespective of state laws making it legal It is now a federal crime to do so and they started trying to get all the doctors in Oregon thrown in jail.

92
00:07:56,283 --> 00:08:00,140
Scott: Alright, so the the exact phrase in question was legitimate medical purpose.

93
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:05,279
Scott: So they were saying that because suicide was about as far as you can get from.

94
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,424
Scott: well Let me quote the guy.

95
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:12,820
Scott: if the term legitimate medical purposes is any meaning It surely excludes the prescription of drugs to produce death.

96
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:19,067
Rym: Now this coming from a supposedly conservative Supreme Court justice Who did or I?

97
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:20,794
Rym: was that Ashcroft or wasn't one of the justices?

98
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,898
Rym: was that the dissenting opinion?

99
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:22,380
Scott: I think it.

100
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:23,863
Scott: Scalia said that.

101
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:26,393
Rym: oh now Scalia is very conservative.

102
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:27,758
Rym: He says very pro states rights.

103
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,437
Rym: yet Now he's saying that because he's arbitrarily against something states don't have the right to do it.

104
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:34,886
Rym: Mm-hmm Yeah, I'm not too fond of that.

105
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:36,332
Scott: Yeah, man, those lefties.

106
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:37,577
Scott: Those are the activist judges.

107
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:52,873
Scott: Let me tell you Yeah, all right, so basically their argument if we're voting against it was that because Killing someone or killing yourself is not a legitimate medical purpose that you couldn't prescribe the illegal drugs for.

108
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:56,920
Scott: you know this Something that's not a legitimate medical purpose.

109
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,605
Scott: So what this really?

110
00:08:58,645 --> 00:08:59,267
Scott: the decision?

111
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:03,360
Scott: since we voted, you know, the those guys lost and the good guys won.

112
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:05,256
Scott: Was that now?

113
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:11,779
Scott: The definition of legitimate medical purpose is expanded to things like killing yourself.

114
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:15,671
Scott: We now could include, you know drugs that they don't want.

115
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:23,379
Rym: see it's actually this ruling is very complicated And I could do a whole podcast on just the majority opinion here.

116
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:29,178
Rym: But to try to sum up as briefly as I can Basically, what what they ruled is that?

117
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,751
Rym: One the state's obvious if you read the CSA.

118
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:49,220
Rym: that is intended to prevent illicit drug use specifically abusable drugs for in and to and To eliminate the abuse of these drugs to better society as in getting rid of heroin addicts and crackheads.

119
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,571
Rym: And in addition to that They also decided that one states rights.

120
00:09:54,711 --> 00:10:00,735
Rym: the state has the right to do this and the Attorney General Does not actually write the CSA he merely administers it.

121
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:01,700
Rym: he parrots it.

122
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,364
Rym: They even use the word parroting.

123
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:08,417
Rym: the phrase parroting an anti parrot cannon appear fairly often around all these decisions here.

124
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:20,319
Rym: if an anti parrot cannon existed But basically because it's not he didn't write it and he didn't use it He's just prescribing it the Attorney General has no right to interpret it.

125
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:32,599
Rym: it is the court's job to interpret it and the only way to possibly use this as a means of Preventing people from killing themselves is to interpret it as to say that it does not include killing oneself.

126
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:46,159
Rym: Mm-hmm, so and they make like five or six other points and they actually call Ashcroft out directly Basically making fun of him for making a decision on a subject that he knows almost nothing about and has no credentials in.

127
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,860
Rym: Well, they they really ride him in this decision.

128
00:10:50,562 --> 00:11:05,920
Scott: You know, I can see like if the Surgeon General did something like this then it would be like, alright, okay You know, we actually have a real thing going on here But the Attorney General a lawyer getting involved in the doctor department.

129
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:08,170
Scott: That makes a whole lot of sense.

130
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:13,732
Rym: I mean, wow Yeah now there's also another really interesting possible.

131
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:16,603
Rym: well to really ramifications of this is One.

132
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:34,075
Rym: you may not realize it but Roe vs Wade might weigh very heavily into this decision because this decision among other things says that states Individually have the right to decide whether or not a medical practice is Allowable and that the federal government cannot do so.

133
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,829
Rym: now It's possible that that would actually undermine Roe vs.

134
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:41,100
Rym: Wade which said that states cannot regulate the right to an abortion.

135
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:50,280
Rym: Mm-hmm, which not to get into that I disagree with Roe vs Wade in terms of the way it was decided, but I definitely agree with the right of a woman to have an abortion.

136
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:54,660
Scott: Yeah, but see what they're saying is because remember it's about a legitimate medical purpose.

137
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:11,149
Scott: So now what we can say is if killing yourself is a legitimate medical purpose by could a doctor for can prescribe medicine Then kill it, you know now we open the door is killing a baby is a legitimate medical purpose And the woman and you're allowed doctors allowed to do it.

138
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,926
Rym: or by the same token that a state could make abortion illegal Despite Roe vs.

139
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:17,957
Rym: Wade and this would be precedent for it.

140
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:19,527
Rym: Mm-hmm And it's we.

141
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:21,220
Rym: there's really no way to say which way it would go.

142
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:28,660
Rym: It's gonna depend a lot on if Scalito actually gets entered into the Supreme Court because basically he's going to vote on the side of the administration no matter what.

143
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:30,346
Rym: Yeah, he's pretty much that is.

144
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:33,918
Scott: but even if he was there right now, it's still pretty cool that it'd be five and four.

145
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:34,939
Rym: Yep.

146
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:52,347
Rym: now the other possible unintended consequence of this is that it really kind of guts the CSA in its in the way that it can regulate the use of drugs because a couple of states have legalized medical marijuana recently and Every time they've done.

147
00:12:52,427 --> 00:13:01,855
Rym: So the federal government has said up up up CSA commerce act commerce clause It's still against federal law, even though it doesn't cross state boundaries.

148
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:02,800
Rym: We're gonna come in and arrest you.

149
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,389
Rym: Anyway, we're gonna send federal marshals.

150
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:05,174
Scott: Mm-hmm.

151
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:10,759
Rym: So This basically says that the state has the right to regulate that and not the federal government.

152
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:12,343
Scott: Yes, there's rights.

153
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:18,520
Rym: So there are only two things keeping a state from legalizing drugs right now the CSA and the Commerce Clause.

154
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:22,000
Rym: Now the CSA was gutted because of this decision.

155
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:26,859
Rym: It really can't be used as justification for having federal laws that make substances illegal anymore.

156
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:39,629
Rym: However, it does not get rid of the Commerce Clause, which Alright, well if I wrap this up because you don't want a commerce clause is the line in the Constitution That says Congress is allowed to make laws like the CSA.

157
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:45,300
Scott: Yeah, so Congress can make another law anytime they feel like and There's not much you can do about it.

158
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:57,867
Rym: What the Commerce Clause does is it says that the federal government can regulate interstate commerce Not intra only commerce between two states or between a state and a foreign power or between the federal government and a foreign power But whatever.

159
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:17,886
Rym: now The thing is the Commerce Clause is very broad and for the last pretty much since the Civil War They've used the Commerce Clause to regulate internal state matters And the rationale is that even though it's entirely within a state it can affect other states Which in my opinion is horseshit.

160
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:22,319
Scott: It is I agree that it's horseshit, but there's really not much you can do about it.

161
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:25,132
Scott: now It's sort of like well, they decided Roe vs.

162
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:25,313
Scott: Wade.

163
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,398
Scott: There's not much you can do about it.

164
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:32,044
Scott: now They decided the Commerce Clause for hundreds of years to pretty much be anything.

165
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:42,579
Scott: the federal government completely controls anything even close to commerce and Congress can make any law at once Pertaining to anything even close to commerce and there's not much you can do about it.

166
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:50,200
Rym: See this all goes back to the Civil War Because I mean a lot of people down south and a lot of historians don't call it the Civil War.

167
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,840
Rym: They call it the war of northern aggression.

168
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:54,067
Rym: Now I used to make fun of that a lot.

169
00:14:54,167 --> 00:15:00,419
Rym: Ah the war northern aggression, but Imagine if slavery hadn't been an issue in the Civil War.

170
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:19,693
Rym: Then if you look at it It's a bunch of states who have decided that they don't like the federal government and that they want to rule themselves Breaking away and the federal government sending troops in and killing countless people And having a huge war and raising cities to the ground in order to force them to remain a part of a union that they'd Have not want nothing to do with

171
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:26,975
Scott: Yep, but then you think about it You throw the slavery in there and all of a sudden it becomes a bunch of slave drivers.

172
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:38,313
Rym: and then this heroic country going to say hey if you want to keep you know, I hate it when an ideology or We're basically when an ideology gets clouded by an issue.

173
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,783
Rym: I'm with the south Ideologically.

174
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:45,820
Rym: the problem is they use that ideology to do to make an issue of something stupid.

175
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:48,314
Rym: They wanted slaves, which is not cool.

176
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:52,480
Scott: Yeah But at the same time they could have wanted something good.

177
00:15:52,541 --> 00:16:00,911
Scott: It could have been like hey We want our state's rights so that we can have video games because there's a federal law outlawing video games You know and that's a good thing.

178
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:04,647
Scott: states rights are good Because it was associated with slavery.

179
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,296
Scott: people think it's bad, but there's nothing wrong with it.

180
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:07,978
Scott: It's great.

181
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,746
Rym: Yeah There's only something wrong with slavery.

182
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,754
Scott: Mm-hmm a lot wrong with slavery.

183
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:12,236
Rym: Yeah.

184
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:16,560
Rym: Yeah But that's enough constitutional talk.

185
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:27,180
Rym: I'll try to a whole show on it sometime because we talk about geekery a lot But we're very politically motivated and we're very loud about it and we could probably do an entire separate four day a week.

186
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:28,484
Rym: Just on politics.

187
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:30,570
Scott: there there are different kinds of geeks.

188
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,914
Scott: they're political geeks out there.

189
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,676
Rym: that works.

190
00:16:32,797 --> 00:16:35,249
Rym: if we ever run out of technology Let's just turn Mondays into.

191
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,840
Scott: I don't think we're gonna run into technology.

192
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:39,839
Rym: Hey, maybe there's some sort of Luddite revolution.

193
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,480
Scott: Then we'll definitely keep going on about technology to get rid of those Luddites.

194
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:52,700
Rym: So we had one more news bit and we'll probably kind of gloss over it because we've gone a while already.

195
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:55,028
Scott: Okay, so you might have read today.

196
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:57,818
Scott: well you might know what I think about World of Warcraft.

197
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:02,878
Rym: not so great Yeah, today's real-life comics pretty much described what I think about World of Warcraft.

198
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:05,635
Scott: Yeah Yesterday's rest doesn't matter.

199
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,640
Scott: Basically, what's been happening in World of Warcraft is there's lots of gold farmers.

200
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,411
Rym: These are people who are basically hired.

201
00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:19,579
Rym: or they do it to make money and they play the game Grinding Lee to make gold and then sell it on eBay or they sell it on other various websites.

202
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:30,970
Scott: Actually, there are various gold farmers and power levelers that were advertising in PC gamer and they would advertise in their monthly With like big expensive ads and PC gamer.

203
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:34,179
Scott: the editors got together and they went to.

204
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:41,680
Scott: you know The company that actually takes care of the ads because you know video game editors don't actually You know take care of the stuff on that level.

205
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,442
Scott: They're below that.

206
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:47,337
Scott: and they said you have to stop putting these ads for gold farmers and power levels in our magazine.

207
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:47,919
Scott: and they did.

208
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:52,278
Scott: They gave up all that money to say that's bad and we're gonna get rid of it.

209
00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:56,660
Rym: And there's been an unexpected consequence of all this in World of Warcraft.

210
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:10,998
Rym: Now there is a huge amount of discrimination against anyone who doesn't speak English because what the the common Stereotype is that the gold farmers are Chinese people which is kind of true.

211
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:12,504
Scott: Yeah The thing is.

212
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:13,810
Scott: is that sure?

213
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:15,940
Scott: most of the gold farmers are Chinese?

214
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,489
Scott: There's some non-chinese gold farmers, but most of them are.

215
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:19,251
Rym: but you know what?

216
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:21,820
Rym: most of the Chinese are not gold farmers.

217
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:22,980
Rym: Yeah They're a pro.

218
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:30,060
Scott: They're like a one and a half million people playing World of Warcraft in China and a very small percentage of them are gold farmers.

219
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:31,526
Rym: It's just like spam.

220
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:34,700
Rym: I mean most spam in the world comes out of Russia and China.

221
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:38,532
Scott: The most email from Russia and China is not spam.

222
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:43,680
Scott: Yep, because there's just so much email I'll draw a Venn diagram for you sometime.

223
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,687
Rym: Understand what we should have some sort of like.

224
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:50,817
Rym: live Oh Akaki to go with the podcast so we can have little diagrams and draw things.

225
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,635
Scott: Yeah, let's not so.

226
00:18:54,662 --> 00:19:01,936
Scott: Now there's a problem where what's happening is People start a group and they want people to join and they say hey before you can join our group.

227
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:02,498
Scott: We don't know.

228
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,139
Scott: you Type two or three sentences in perfect English, you know.

229
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:15,819
Scott: they ask them a couple questions and expect them to answer in English and if the grammar is broken or Anything like that then they say oh you're just a gold farmer go away now.

230
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:23,200
Rym: This is the point at which I call shenanigans on this possibly apocryphal tale Because I don't think there's anyone in World of Warcraft who uses proper grammar.

231
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,530
Scott: I can name a few people but I know those people well.

232
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,389
Rym: actually Scott you had some trouble with grammar the other day didn't know How an adverb works?

233
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:31,579
Scott: I know an adverb works.

234
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,160
Rym: You didn't seem to realize that adverbs can also modify other other adverbs and in fact cannot also modify adjectives.

235
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,103
Scott: Well, it's like a thing.

236
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:43,000
Scott: I know it's like I use adverbs correctly when I speak and when I write.

237
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,148
Scott: I just you know don't know the The rules like.

238
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:52,700
Scott: I guess I can quote you and yesterday It's like I can play D&D and I can roll a d20 and I can tell you if I hit or not.

239
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,685
Scott: But I can't tell you.

240
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:56,880
Scott: you know, there was like a base attack bonus and a deflection.

241
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:00,392
Scott: God knows what other talk is in that book.

242
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:01,898
Rym: So you are you are right.

243
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,110
Rym: good Yeah, yeah.

244
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:08,424
Rym: Yeah We Argue about grammar a lot.

245
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,570
Rym: We don't really argue Scott just things.

246
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,097
Scott: It's not really much to argue about grammar.

247
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:14,220
Scott: This is right wrong?

248
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,750
Scott: Yeah, you look it up and you say up.

249
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,715
Scott: There's the right answer.

250
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:18,398
Scott: That's yeah.

251
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:23,440
Rym: No, there was the point when you denied the fact that sometimes is or somewhat was an adverb.

252
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:24,970
Scott: But I didn't know it was an adverb.

253
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,118
Rym: it didn't what you think it was.

254
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:27,324
Scott: What do you think?

255
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:29,031
Scott: it didn't seem very adverb like.

256
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:31,260
Scott: but then I looked at dictionary and I was wrong.

257
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:31,965
Scott: So what do you want?

258
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:34,060
Rym: Yeah, I mean, what did you think it modified?

259
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,119
Rym: Somewhat what?

260
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,586
Scott: Well, I guess it could modify An adjective.

261
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,632
Rym: Oh, yeah.

262
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:41,874
Rym: Yep.

263
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:42,135
Rym: Yep.

264
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:45,009
Scott: Yep, hence Yeah, all right.

265
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,370
Scott: It's not an ad adjective But I figure you know an adjective.

266
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,340
Scott: I thought an adjective could modify an adjective.

267
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:00,937
Scott: You ever do one of those.

268
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,500
Scott: name that tune kind of thing.

269
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,635
Scott: So they play a song and you got to say what it is and who sung it.

270
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:09,038
Rym: name that beard name that beard.

271
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:10,484
Scott: More like name that tune.

272
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:24,160
Scott: But anyway, it's a PBS of all places put up a nice little flash game where 18 questions, I think Yeah, 18. and they play sound effects from old old old video games.

273
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,239
Scott: we're talking Atari and Intellivision 2 an arcade old Atari era arcade machines.

274
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:47,420
Scott: and Then they ask you which game it was and they'll usually give you three choices and then also give you like a cryptic sentence is a hint on some of them and I got a 15 out of 18, but that's because I didn't look at the hints and a couple of them threw me off.

275
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,826
Rym: Yep, I didn't look at the hints either.

276
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:52,280
Rym: I only got a 13 but two of them were bullshit.

277
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:54,609
Scott: I gotta say which ones are bullshit.

278
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:58,540
Rym: Oh the berserk one wasn't so much bullshit It was always and I got that one, right?

279
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,580
Rym: He cuz I. I'm actually really really good at the Atari version, but I didn't know there was an arcade version of berserk.

280
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,708
Scott: It's an arcade version of everything Mmm all the Atari game.

281
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,459
Rym: I defy you to find an arcade version of snap fucking foo.

282
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:13,308
Scott: Look, yeah, there might be.

283
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:15,458
Scott: Mame has so many freaking roms man.

284
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:15,820
Scott: It's yeah.

285
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:26,928
Scott: But anyway, if you want to test your old-school Atari knowledges head on over to my thing of the day and You'll see how you stand up.

286
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:28,720
Rym: It's quite cool, dude.

287
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:34,560
Rym: Yeah, some of them are real obvious and real awesome.

288
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:42,691
Rym: So my thing this is in a foreign policy magazine, which I actually used to read Because I used to be able to like.

289
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:52,345
Rym: the thing is in my high school We had the Lexis Nexus for free and we also had subscriptions to pretty much every magazine Ever RIT had.

290
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:54,692
Scott: that I didn't take advantage of until way later though.

291
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:55,173
Rym: Yeah.

292
00:22:55,293 --> 00:22:57,420
Scott: Yeah, but the internet provided much much more.

293
00:22:57,882 --> 00:22:58,405
Rym: Yes, it did.

294
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:06,799
Rym: But I used to say just have time when I was bored in high school So I go to the library and just read like all these various magazines I was a big fan of the Atlantic Monthly - mm-hmm.

295
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:17,399
Rym: But basically this is a nice online bit and they think they have more in the magazine, but it's a photo journal of Bangladeshi scrap workers.

296
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:21,797
Scott: Bangladesh isn't that like one of the poorest countries that are?

297
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:26,160
Rym: is yes Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries that has ever existed.

298
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:41,493
Scott: I mean I remember a thing from a Bangladesh guy and this is back in the days when they actually talked about first world second world third world instead of developing and developed nations and The guy was like, yeah, Bangladesh is like the fourth world nation.

299
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:43,359
Scott: It's so bad and so poor.

300
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:54,338
Rym: so Bangladesh also has what pretty much the largest beach in the world and it's also used as the largest docking or dry docking facility in the world.

301
00:23:54,358 --> 00:24:01,812
Rym: and You know super tankers and by super tanker I mean the giant giant giant oil tankers that are.

302
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:04,340
Rym: they're the biggest things on the ocean.

303
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,599
Rym: They're bigger than a super aircraft carriers and they carry oil around.

304
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:25,100
Rym: They wear out pretty kit quick and when they get decommissioned more than half of them in the world end up in Bangladesh Where and I kid you not about 200,000 peasants with their bare hands tear them apart to scrap and that is the primary industry there.

305
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:28,439
Rym: This accounts for almost all the steel that Bangladesh has.

306
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:30,805
Scott: That's a lot of steel though.

307
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:33,614
Scott: These pictures are and they get it for free.

308
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:35,320
Rym: They don't get it for free.

309
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,423
Rym: You'd look at these pictures.

310
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:39,571
Rym: These people do something that I I mean money-wise.

311
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:42,860
Rym: Oh, yeah, I couldn't imagine people actually doing this.

312
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:51,380
Rym: I mean they show this super tanker and then they show it gone Because these people have just ripped every piece of steel off of it and carried it away on their backs.

313
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:55,945
Rym: Wow these pictures are Worth looking at.

314
00:24:56,487 --> 00:25:02,013
Scott: I mean some of the things I can understand like oh, they took the fire extinguisher They took you know, the stair railing.

315
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:04,886
Scott: they took the chairs You know that that kind of stuff.

316
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:05,469
Scott: the doors.

317
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:15,620
Scott: you can take the hinges off and take the door but like Eventually you get to pieces that are just big heavy pieces of metal bolted together and welded together.

318
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:21,488
Scott: You can't really take them especially not without Extremely powerful tools yet.

319
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:25,059
Rym: This supplies 80% of Bangladesh's steel this industry.

320
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,060
Rym: Well, yeah, these are some very sad looking people.

321
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:34,454
Scott: I'd be pretty sad if I was hanging out in a tank.

322
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:44,000
Rym: I mean, I guess the only Glimmer I can see in this is that if nothing else it proves the tenacity of mankind to survive no matter what.

323
00:25:45,822 --> 00:25:49,820
Rym: Mmm, look at what these people do to survive and people here think they got it bad.

324
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,067
Scott: It's like the power goes out.

325
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:53,280
Rym: Yeah, or their blog gets spammed.

326
00:25:57,162 --> 00:26:00,013
Rym: So today's video game day and since we've gone long that's fine.

327
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:01,880
Rym: We have one and a half games to talk about.

328
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:03,364
Scott: Yeah, totally awesome.

329
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:19,112
Rym: So we're gonna talk today about Mario Luigi partners in time which Scott just beat and Then I'm gonna rant about Ultima for until he stops me I thought it was - no no no - is God We'll talk about.

330
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,317
Rym: don't even get me into Ultima.

331
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,926
Rym: Anyway, I'm gonna get into Ultima, but not just yet.

332
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:25,957
Scott: So Mario Luigi partners in time.

333
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:35,610
Scott: I just beat it on the train today and I Like the Superstar Saga a little bit better than the partners in time.

334
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,739
Scott: But the partners in time was worth playing.

335
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:47,417
Scott: if I would have known that it wasn't as good as Superstar Saga I might have wanted to pay like five dollars less, but whatever It was still pretty hilarious.

336
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,155
Scott: You know, there's a lot of funny jokes here and there and The you can all.

337
00:26:52,296 --> 00:27:00,470
Scott: the one thing I didn't like about it was that you never really They had a future world in a past world and I thought that would be the cool mechanic that you know.

338
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,919
Scott: Like Metroid Prime 2 has.

339
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:03,126
Scott: we're like, oh you're in the future.

340
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:07,690
Scott: in the past You know the puzzles crossover like that, but not really.

341
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:16,016
Scott: It's just the past is where all the game is and the future is just the happy princess castle town where you do You know normal town stuff.

342
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:17,000
Scott: That was it.

343
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:27,953
Scott: Uh-huh, you know and Superstar Saga the old the Gameboy one had more of like this exploring type of thing where you'd go different places and Try to find stuff.

344
00:27:28,655 --> 00:27:30,722
Scott: This one was like very linear.

345
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:36,830
Scott: You can always turn around like When a level was real big like a third of the way through it.

346
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,148
Scott: They would give you like a little pipe to get back to the beginning in case you wanted to go back to the.

347
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:46,210
Scott: you know The town castle to freshen up, you know get some more mushrooms and whatever.

348
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:49,602
Scott: But other than that, it was like a straight through game.

349
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:51,350
Rym: I don't know if I like that.

350
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,081
Rym: I'm getting kind of tired of that kind of linear gameplay.

351
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:59,950
Scott: Yeah one thing though at the end I don't want to give away the end, but I will say that there were three bosses.

352
00:28:00,131 --> 00:28:01,962
Scott: There was a square boss and a cube boss.

353
00:28:02,324 --> 00:28:05,038
Scott: Wow, yeah and there were this.

354
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:10,719
Scott: there was a flurry of save spots at the end and Once I figured out what they were doing with these save spots.

355
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,245
Scott: I actually thought it was pretty nice.

356
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:13,028
Scott: It was.

357
00:28:14,252 --> 00:28:24,085
Scott: you know, you know, there are always things that happen in games over and over again and everyone's annoyed by them and No one ever seems to correct them no matter how many years they annoy us for.

358
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:31,020
Scott: and in this game They corrected one of those things right before The the point of no return.

359
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,663
Scott: right.

360
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,950
Scott: there was a normal save spot.

361
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:48,623
Scott: then Like I was about to go in this door and there's this little suitcase character who is part of the plot But whatever and you're always carrying him around with you and he comes out and he says This is the point at which you will not be able to turn back.

362
00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:50,209
Scott: You know, the bosses are ahead.

363
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:54,184
Scott: Sit, you know you better save and then he forces you to save.

364
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:55,690
Scott: he like blocks the paths.

365
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:05,249
Rym: Wow Final Fantasy 4 could have freaking use that because I'm at the end on the GBA version and For all of you remember the end of that game.

366
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:20,973
Rym: Basically, there's a final save spot and then if you want to go fight You know Zemus and all the crazy stuff at the end You have to walk for like two or three minutes and then you have to go through a couple minutes of plot and dialogue And all this crap before you can fight him and then you die in two seconds You have to do it again.

367
00:29:20,994 --> 00:29:24,229
Rym: You have to go through so much to fight him every time you lose.

368
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:29,969
Scott: Then I go through and there is yet another save spot and I save.

369
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:38,750
Scott: and you know And I fight the first boss and then after the first boss I hit the save spot and he says Do you want to go back before you save the princess?

370
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,699
Scott: You know, I guess I kind of get beat that come on.

371
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,224
Scott: Everyone saves a princess in Mario.

372
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:44,730
Rym: Now the princess dies.

373
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,106
Scott: Yeah, the princess totally dies.

374
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:48,249
Scott: He says do you want to go back?

375
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:58,383
Scott: So when you whenever you hit this save spot You can actually use it to teleport back and fight that boss again and go back into the game Where the boss is unbeaten.

376
00:29:58,786 --> 00:29:59,049
Scott: All right.

377
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:11,560
Scott: so you can do that or you can just save and continue and fight the next boss and After that boss is yet another save spot Which will let you teleport back in time to before you beat the bosses.

378
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:21,030
Scott: and then is if you know you go and there's this The third boss and there's yet another save spot that will let you teleport back or save.

379
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:25,310
Scott: So it's like I have the game saved at the end of the game after I've beaten the whole thing.

380
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,695
Scott: There's nothing left to beat at all.

381
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:30,670
Scott: But if I go and hit that save spot I can go back into the game.

382
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:35,553
Scott: You know before I beat the final bosses, that's kind of cool It's really.

383
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:38,222
Scott: it was very handy once I realized what the hell they were doing.

384
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:45,329
Rym: It's like oh you've made the end less painful Thank you, yep now it's fun to just go back and fiddle with things when you're bored a year from now.

385
00:30:45,912 --> 00:30:47,924
Scott: Yeah, there's not much to fiddle with though.

386
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:58,264
Scott: Honestly in this game I mean I pretty much cleaned out every single area for every secret I needed and Like I leveled up all the characters like level 31 and I didn't ever actually level up.

387
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:11,270
Scott: I just went through the game straight and Because they pretty much mastered the use of all of the bros items You know and you only don't really need to use all the bros items like the chomp ones.

388
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:13,284
Scott: I never used some of the items.

389
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:17,990
Scott: they were just Harder to use than like the red shells and they didn't do as much damage.

390
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:19,967
Scott: so I never had a reason to use them.

391
00:31:19,987 --> 00:31:28,410
Scott: and I still beat the living crap out of the final bosses doing like a zillion damage because I've Bothered to collect enough beans and get good badges.

392
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:34,549
Scott: and collecting beans was a lot more fun than some of the other tasks being animals.

393
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:37,938
Scott: Yeah, the bean collecting was actually more advanced.

394
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:48,100
Scott: in the gameboy one, you know, it feels like they kind of like Like it's a good game because Mario and Luigi Mario RPG type game.

395
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:53,720
Scott: But this one feels a little more like like they hurried up to get it out, you know.

396
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:56,779
Scott: And they didn't you know make the fullness what they could have.

397
00:31:57,201 --> 00:32:04,063
Scott: They just said oh we'll use a B X and Y and the DS and you know, we'll be all good You know.

398
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:11,353
Scott: whereas with the Superstar Saga and thousand-year door paper Mario They really made like paper door the paper Mario.

399
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:11,856
Scott: Oh my god.

400
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:12,880
Scott: That's like the amazing.

401
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:21,894
Rym: Yeah, cuz I I'm real liria games like this in general, but paper Mario is calling to me And if I ever have free time, I'm just gonna sit down and beat that game like bang.

402
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:38,820
Scott: Yeah, so For partners in time if You're like a huge fan of the you know the Mario and you like paper Mario's and Mario RPGs You should get it cuz it's not the greatest of those but it's still great enough to warrant playing.

403
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:44,240
Scott: But if you're if that's not your thing, then this is not the one to play.

404
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,627
Scott: you're better off playing the gameboy one or Paper Mario on the GameCube.

405
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:51,640
Rym: paper Mario on the GameCube looks just fantastic.

406
00:32:52,243 --> 00:32:54,774
Scott: It's totally and it's much bigger and more interesting.

407
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:56,059
Rym: and there's a goomba girl.

408
00:32:56,823 --> 00:32:58,731
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what it is about this goomba girl.

409
00:32:58,751 --> 00:32:59,655
Rym: It's cute.

410
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:00,599
Scott: She's real cute.

411
00:33:03,202 --> 00:33:07,300
Rym: So this podcast kind of went long as they tend to do when we're real opinionated.

412
00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:10,010
Rym: But a real quick and nice aside.

413
00:33:10,392 --> 00:33:12,580
Rym: Ultima for the quest of the Avatar.

414
00:33:13,503 --> 00:33:22,780
Rym: Now this was an NES game and I just have a question to the world as anyone actually played All these Ultima games and are any of them actually playable?

415
00:33:23,821 --> 00:33:33,419
Rym: They're all just these terrible monstrosities and I could never play any of them for more than about 10 seconds without just getting pissed off And stopping I just tried to play what three of them?

416
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:40,478
Scott: Yeah on the NES downstairs all the computer ROM NES emulator downstairs and all three of them.

417
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:44,739
Scott: well Some of them seemed like they had interesting components to them.

418
00:33:46,044 --> 00:33:56,956
Scott: All three of them were just completely unplayable terrible games that I just ah It is painful to even try to do anything like talking to people was hard.

419
00:33:56,976 --> 00:34:11,391
Rym: I Mean, there's one Ultima game that I've ever played that didn't suck as much And that was Ultima for the Avatar because it looks it's the only one that looks like a real NES game like it works like a console game, of course, it came out for the PC too.

420
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:17,286
Rym: And if you play that version well I'm sorry It's a completely different game.

421
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,271
Rym: play the NES version.

422
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:20,478
Rym: It's probably the best Ultima game ever created.

423
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:25,996
Scott: You know, I have a feeling though that like Ultima on the PC was something different.

424
00:34:26,117 --> 00:34:28,771
Rym: cuz in now I played several of them on the PC.

425
00:34:28,811 --> 00:34:29,877
Rym: They're terrible game.

426
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:30,400
Rym: Really?

427
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,500
Scott: Yeah, cuz whenever I hear people talk about Ultima in a good light, they seem to always be talking about PC games.

428
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,085
Scott: I never you know when they're talking about.

429
00:34:38,507 --> 00:34:39,330
Rym: well, they all.

430
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,755
Scott: any s is like something else.

431
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:45,226
Rym: They all came out on the PC Mm-hmm and Ultima zero.

432
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:52,565
Rym: the first one is just this piss-poor like semi 3d dungeon crawl thing and There was no plot at all.

433
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:52,946
Rym: Really.

434
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:55,254
Scott: Is that one of those ones of the first-person perspective?

435
00:34:55,495 --> 00:35:00,330
Scott: kind of any drag items Like into like the arm slot the chest slot.

436
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,594
Rym: It's not that sophisticated.

437
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:05,271
Scott: Oh, I like those what that's like dungeon master That those are great or dungeon hack.

438
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:05,874
Rym: I used to play.

439
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:12,080
Rym: Mm-hmm But basically all the Ultima's were on the PC and they were all just these plotting.

440
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,120
Rym: Terrible arbitrarily difficult games like some Nintendo games are arbitrary.

441
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,759
Rym: You know pick the right warp area throw the holy water on the right brick.

442
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:33,439
Rym: But just to give you a sample because Ultima 4 in my opinion is the best of these games and it's actually a really good game except for the fact that part of the plot is that you have to find like these seven runes and these seven stones all these different items.

443
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:36,517
Rym: and Here's an example of the locations of these items.

444
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:55,260
Rym: one of these runes is if you go to a certain town called pause which is south of another town and you go into the town and you walk over to where the stables are and Then you walk like two spaces to the left and three spaces up and then you hit a and search You'll find this critical plot item that you need to win the game.

445
00:35:56,681 --> 00:36:02,139
Scott: Is there like a character in the game who says hey look search the stable to find the item or anything like that?

446
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,420
Rym: Barely, you'll find a guy on the other side of the world completely unrelated who will say like there's something special in that town.

447
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:15,099
Rym: There's someone else in another side of the world who would say something like something something stables.

448
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:17,666
Rym: That's probably the easiest.

449
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:20,157
Scott: is there any sort of connection between them at all?

450
00:36:20,197 --> 00:36:22,067
Rym: God Let me put it this way.

451
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:23,817
Rym: That's probably the easiest one to find.

452
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,131
Rym: great I mean like that.

453
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,539
Rym: you can has magic in the game, right?

454
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:33,800
Rym: But not only do you have magic points, but you have spell components like ten different kinds of spell components.

455
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,465
Rym: Some are cheap some are expensive.

456
00:36:35,846 --> 00:36:37,812
Rym: You've only some cities have them for sale.

457
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:39,156
Rym: They only have certain ones for sale.

458
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:53,010
Rym: and To learn a new spell you have to learn which components to use as in literally you have to remember based on people you talk to that it's Mandrake ash and Something else to cast this spell.

459
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:57,591
Scott: in order to know how to cast the spell I would just write them all down in a piece of paper.

460
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:59,220
Rym: Yeah, you have to use a piece of paper.

461
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,069
Rym: You can't win this game.

462
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:09,459
Rym: You have to write down gobs of information and memorize things and memorize that certain colors go with certain virtues that go with certain symbols that go with certain stones.

463
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,509
Rym: and It's just this.

464
00:37:12,115 --> 00:37:15,007
Rym: I Hate this game so much yet.

465
00:37:15,248 --> 00:37:18,778
Rym: I played it constantly because I I was convinced that there was something to it.

466
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,926
Rym: Mm-hmm of course now.

467
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:25,945
Rym: I know better because I read game facts, and I found out that there's nothing to it Really nothing at all.

468
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:31,192
Rym: now the game just kind of a and when you finally beat it It's just arbitrary and crap and the endings kind of blah.

469
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:35,914
Scott: the ending is blah If usually games like that have a crazy exciting ending.

470
00:37:36,578 --> 00:37:38,820
Rym: no in fact I won't link to it because I don't want to spoil it.

471
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:43,200
Rym: But if you google around you'll find a site that has pictures of the entire end of the game.

472
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:44,448
Rym: It's just some text.

473
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:46,200
Scott: That's it basically.

474
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:54,522
Rym: Wow, I mean the ultimate games form this giant epic overarching plot and the continuity is Ridiculous.

475
00:37:54,984 --> 00:37:59,620
Rym: like you'll be a party who kills a guy this evil guy named mundane in a previous ultimate game.

476
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:04,020
Rym: And then an ultimate for if you remember it because the world's always the same.

477
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:10,270
Rym: Where the skull of mundane is you can go get it, and it's as powerful artifact And in fact you have to get it to beat the game.

478
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,191
Scott: Oh I get it.

479
00:38:13,434 --> 00:38:15,567
Scott: yeah That's kind of cool.

480
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:16,332
Rym: It'd be cool.

481
00:38:16,372 --> 00:38:17,620
Rym: If the games didn't suck ass.

482
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,390
Rym: Yeah, I guess what I'm looking for.

483
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:22,280
Rym: cuz I'm done ranting I could rant forever.

484
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:27,957
Rym: Is there anyone out there listen to GeekNights who actually played and liked any Ultima game ever?

485
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:28,980
Rym: cuz I want to talk to you.

486
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:30,718
Rym: I got some questions.

487
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:39,697
Scott: Yeah, also If you can beat any levels in the silver surfer for the NES I'd like to hear from you also.

488
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:43,020
Rym: We should just have a tournament with anyone who listens to GeekNights.

489
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,024
Rym: She's close enough to us.

490
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:45,811
Rym: you get a stopwatch timer.

491
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:47,780
Rym: whoever lasts the longest wins.

492
00:38:48,302 --> 00:38:51,860
Scott: No, I knew a kid way back in the day who actually had the cartridge.

493
00:38:52,021 --> 00:38:53,592
Scott: He could beat a few levels of that game.

494
00:38:54,116 --> 00:38:54,640
Scott: It was scary.

495
00:38:56,362 --> 00:38:59,039
Scott: On the on a cartridge no less no saving and loading business.

496
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,004
Rym: All right, so we're done.

499
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:17,011

500
00:39:17,031 --> 00:39:19,480
Scott: Yeah, that was just a little confusing.

00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,920
