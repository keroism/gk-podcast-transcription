00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,698
Rym: It's Tuesday, September 27th, 2016.

2
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:09,939
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:13,410
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,398
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:18,190
Rym: Press your luck in a deep sea adventure.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,618
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,926
Scott: So, it got cold.

8
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:29,733
Scott: Which is also a problem.

9
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:31,620
Scott: that's not really a first world problem.

10
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:35,550
Rym: So today- Hey, cuz man I got some second world problems.

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,879
Rym: That Soviet block, ugh.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,451
Scott: Anyway, so I go today cuz it's cold.

13
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:42,640
Scott: Put on pants instead of shorts.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,174
Rym: I've been wearing pants lately.

15
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:44,599
Rym: You know why?

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,911
Rym: The air conditioning's still on in my building.

17
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:48,340
Rym: It's like 60 degrees in there.

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,848
Scott: Oh, anyway, so I go to put on pants and you know what?

19
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,457
Rym: Pants are awful.

20
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:54,100
Scott: Too big.

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,223
Rym: Too big?

22
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:55,686
Rym: You know why?

23
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:57,900
Rym: Cuz, well, I guess you haven't been biking as much, but you still bike.

24
00:00:58,202 --> 00:00:58,999
Rym: You'll lose some weight if you bike.

25
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:03,660
Scott: I mean, the thing is I've always weighed less at the end of summer than at the beginning.

26
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:05,780
Scott: That's just how bears work, right?

27
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:06,341
Scott: Yeah.

28
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:13,500
Rym: I mean, I gained about five pounds like pretty much right after magfest is when that weight starts going away.

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,682
Rym: But like magfest time?

30
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:22,540
Rym: That's like the death knell of my stomach cuz that is Thanksgiving, bonus Thanksgivings, of which there are several, Christmas.

31
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,236
Scott: And it's not like, but it's like I bike less this year than any year, right?

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,300
Scott: I mean, I didn't bike to work cuz, you know, they wouldn't let me bring my bike inside and such.

33
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,207
Rym: Yup.

34
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:37,679
Scott: So obviously I'm not exercising or dieting because I don't do that.

35
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:39,560
Rym: Well, you bike.

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,115
Scott: I bike less than any previous year yet for some reason.

37
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:45,160
Scott: This never happened before.

38
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,117
Scott: I went to put my pants on.

39
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:47,596
Scott: Yup.

40
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,929
Scott: And it's not just like, oh, you know, they're a little.

41
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:54,520
Scott: it's like, no, I need to go buy pants that are one or two sizes smaller.

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,891
Scott: I might have to like because I had the belt where you cut the.

43
00:01:57,454 --> 00:01:58,620
Scott: I might have to like cut the belt.

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,280
Scott: But then what if I do and I get fat later?

45
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,053
Rym: Wait, you got the fancy track line belt?

46
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:02,840
Rym: What kind of belt is this?

47
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,039
Scott: Yeah, it's with the thingy.

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,946
Rym: Yeah, I got four of them.

49
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:06,800
Rym: I got like one of every combination to the best.

50
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,395
Scott: But it's like now I have to cut it.

51
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,313
Scott: But if I have to uncut it, I can't do that.

52
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:12,500
Scott: I can only go in one direction.

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:21,360
Rym: See, I've always had this rule that and this was a rule when I was a little kid that I would never, ever, ever buy pants with a bigger waist than the pants I currently wear.

54
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,200
Scott: You're wearing the pants that are the same size when you were a three year old?

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,828
Scott: Well, once I became a teenager/a little kid, though.

56
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:30,871
Rym: Well, yeah.

57
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:32,160
Rym: So like 18.

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,309
Scott: Sure.

59
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:37,397
Rym: Once I hit my like, you know, in high school, I wore a 32 inch waist.

60
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:38,100
Rym: That was like my waist.

61
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,700
Rym: And then after when I went to RIT, it went down to about 30 because I started like really exercising.

62
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,148
Rym: And it's pretty much stayed around 30.

63
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:48,916
Rym: So I just only ever buy pants that are 30 or 31 tops.

64
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:54,113
Rym: And if I ever like can't put those pants on, I just won't wear pants.

65
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,357
Rym: Like I got that weight.

66
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:56,300
Rym: That weight's got to go away.

67
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:57,303
Scott: But what do I do?

68
00:02:57,363 --> 00:03:00,473
Scott: Do I have plenty of perfectly good pants?

69
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:02,520
Scott: and I was not planning to buy new pants.

70
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,371
Scott: Should I just eat a bunch of barbecue instead of buying?

71
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:10,100
Scott: Because I could spend my money on barbecue instead of pants.

72
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:12,933
Scott: And that might be a better deal.

73
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:14,200
Scott: Right?

74
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:17,048
Rym: I don't know.

75
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:17,894
Rym: You could just...

76
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,159
Scott: Because pants are expensive and I had to buy all new pants.

77
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:23,548
Rym: Maybe it's time.

78
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:24,820
Rym: Maybe it's time to do a pants audit.

79
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:27,451
Scott: But I bought new pants even last year.

80
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:29,400
Scott: I have pants that are like a year old, perfectly good.

81
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,280
Scott: Nothing wrong with them, except they're no longer my size.

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,280
Rym: You could donate them to charity.

83
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:34,123
Scott: Sure.

84
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:37,260
Scott: That's a lot of pants money that could have been barbecue money.

85
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,948
Rym: The thing is, I'd say that it might extend your life.

86
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:45,840
Rym: So if you buy new pants because you're in better shape and you stay smaller.

87
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,904
Scott: But I didn't even do anything.

88
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:52,440
Scott: Everyone else is like, people are trying crazy shit to lose weight and I didn't do shit.

89
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,747
Scott: I just live as I normally live.

90
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,913
Scott: And I'm not sick.

91
00:03:56,973 --> 00:03:59,260
Scott: It's not like I'm losing weight because I'm diseased in the hospital.

92
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,040
Rym: Maybe you do the thing that apparently, according to that TED talk, most Americans can't do, of you only eat when you're hungry?

93
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:07,748
Scott: I've done that my entire life.

94
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:10,120
Scott: It's not any different in the year 2016 than 2015.

95
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,125
Rym: Are you hungry less?

96
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:14,119
Rym: Or maybe with Blue Apron you're eating better and cooking more and going out less?

97
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,120
Scott: I only get Blue Apron not that frequently.

98
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,080
Rym: Because we make three Blue Aprons a week and we eat out a lot less.

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,039
Rym: Because I was looking through finance stuff, we eat out about half as often as we used to.

100
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:30,263
Scott: I don't know.

101
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:34,620
Scott: I mean, I could check my Grubhub order frequency, but I doubt that really makes that big a difference.

102
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:41,020
Scott: I just ate like a giant slice of cake at work yesterday and didn't give a fuck, as usual.

103
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:44,140
Scott: There's actually been lots of cakes at work lately.

104
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:52,300
Rym: Well, I mean, the thing is, you eat reasonably healthily, but it is known that for most of my life, I've eaten nothing but garbage.

105
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:53,728
Scott: Cookies.

106
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:55,280
Scott: You eat a whole package of cookies.

107
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:56,659
Rym: At RIT, too.

108
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,600
Scott: When it's cookies, I eat one serving of cookies at a time.

109
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,499
Rym: Scott would get things at Vienna Fingers and there were times when I would eat an entire row of them.

110
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,860
Scott: Yeah, I would eat two or three at a time.

111
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,125
Rym: How could you eat that few cookies?

112
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:10,697
Rym: When you eat one cookie, it's like cookie fugue.

113
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:11,260
Rym: You just eat them all.

114
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,520
Rym: You keep eating until there's no more cookies.

115
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:20,320
Scott: I eat, you know, one serving of cookie or maybe two serving and then I have a bunch of cookie for later and I can eat servings of cookie every day.

116
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,256
Rym: So for the first time...

117
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,260
Scott: So even though, I mean, you eat a whole row at once, but I probably eat two rows over the course of a month.

118
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,900
Rym: But I just buy another thing of cookies for the next day to ensure...

119
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:35,240
Scott: Yeah, you're eating a whole, you know, store's worth in a month, but I'm eating a whole package in a month.

120
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,932
Rym: I actually exercised some self-restraint the other day.

121
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:38,776
Rym: So basically...

122
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:40,899
Scott: You're capable of that?

123
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,870
Rym: So yeah, this was kind of crazy.

124
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,820
Rym: So the shnippers open next to my office, right?

125
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,200
Rym: Real hard to not just go there every day.

126
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,920
Scott: I mean, there's a shnippers near me, but I go there pretty rarely.

127
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,219
Rym: Well, it is like right there.

128
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:53,397
Scott: How close could it be?

129
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,419
Rym: Like literally one block.

130
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,880
Scott: Mine's like five, six, seven blocks.

131
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,920
Rym: One tiny downtown block.

132
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,900
Scott: But they're all small blocks.

133
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,492
Rym: You know those blocks that are like not even a block?

134
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,247
Rym: Yeah, it's one block like that.

135
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:07,180
Rym: I can almost see it from the window in our office.

136
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,200
Rym: So I have not yet eaten a burger there because, you know, I eat burgers here.

137
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,471
Scott: Actually, I think I've only gotten a burger at shnippers once.

138
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:16,220
Scott: I usually get the chicken sandwich with the good stuff.

139
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,879
Rym: I got their sloppy joe last time.

140
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,940
Rym: That's not something I'm making anymore at home.

141
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,456
Scott: I made a sloppy joe from Blue Apron.

142
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:21,780
Scott: It was great.

143
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,180
Rym: Yeah.

144
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:30,140
Rym: So I go over there at like three o'clock because I walked downstairs and I'm like gonna get some coffee and I walk and I remember the shnippers there.

145
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:33,560
Rym: So what I did is I went over there and just got a milkshake instead.

146
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:34,319
Scott: All right.

147
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:35,670
Rym: I was like, just give me a shake.

148
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:36,880
Rym: And she was like, what kind of burger do you want?

149
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,928
Rym: I was like, no, I just want to shake.

150
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,279
Rym: And she was like, that's a good idea.

151
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:41,709
Rym: And I took the shake up to the office.

152
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:43,420
Rym: And the crazy thing is I go upstairs.

153
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,220
Rym: Literally every single person who works in our office because it's an open floor plan walks over like as I walk by, they're like, what's that?

154
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,645
Rym: And I'm like, milkshake.

155
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,212
Rym: And they're like, milkshake?

156
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:55,120
Rym: Where did you get a milkshake?

157
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:59,200
Rym: And I was like, well, one, there's a Shake Shack across the street and two, shnippers.

158
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:01,180
Rym: So now my entire office.

159
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,949
Scott: Also, you could just there's a blender in our office.

160
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,140
Scott: I could get ice cream and milk and just make them.

161
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:05,762
Rym: Yeah.

162
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:11,220
Rym: So my office, I one day like I wanted some coffee and I showed up early, like before the ops team and everyone shows up.

163
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,300
Rym: So I go over to that coffee maker that they make coffee in and I opened it to make coffee.

164
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,979
Rym: And the coffee from the previous Friday was still in there, all moldy.

165
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,340
Rym: And then I realized that they never clean that thing ever.

166
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,260
Scott: Oh, we have the pod thingy, which I've never used in my life because I don't drink poison.

167
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,294
Rym: It makes coffee the opposite of poison.

168
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:29,899
Rym: Coffee is good for you.

169
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,780
Rym: There's serious evidence that it's mostly good for you.

170
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,600
Scott: I think the problem with coffee is whether it's good for your health.

171
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,699
Rym: Probably it's like spice once you start.

172
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,333
Scott: The problem with coffee is I have a hypothesis.

173
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:42,680
Scott: Obviously, I don't have any evidence of this.

174
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:43,739
Rym: I'll hear you out.

175
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,480
Scott: I think that the people with the attitudes of workaholism who like working are people who drink.

176
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,880
Scott: I think if we got if we eliminated coffee from Earth, everyone would be like me and just want to go to the beach.

177
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,426
Rym: So it's got two counterpoints.

178
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:59,399
Rym: during the rise of the Nazis, like during the war.

179
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:04,599
Rym: A good chunk of German society was high on meth all the time.

180
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,030
Rym: And I thought something like Adderall and all the like they were.

181
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:08,813
Rym: that was like.

182
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:10,640
Rym: that was the let's be productive.

183
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:12,115
Rym: Fuck it mentality.

184
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:12,459
Rym: Sure.

185
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:15,708
Rym: I drink a lot of coffee.

186
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:18,159
Rym: I do not want to work hard.

187
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:21,299
Scott: You work harder than me.

188
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:22,478
Rym: I would be on the beach.

189
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,958
Scott: You work harder than me.

190
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,740
Rym: The thing is, I would form a game studio on the beach, but I wouldn't do a lot of work at the game studio.

191
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:32,960
Rym: Say, you know, I do a little work is I'd make stuff happen.

192
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,998
Scott: You're working harder than me.

193
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,859
Scott: You're trying to do.

194
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,859
Scott: You're putting effort towards working.

195
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:38,700
Rym: Well, I guess I have goals.

196
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,840
Rym: My goal is to get to the beach.

197
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
Rym: You have no path to the beach from where you are right now.

198
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,559
Rym: I have a path to the beach that does not significantly impact my day to day life.

199
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:47,681
Scott: Yeah.

200
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:54,600
Scott: Anyway, I think I think if you eliminated coffee, you would not be able to go down that path.

201
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:57,740
Scott: If I eliminated coffee is powering your path vehicle.

202
00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:59,440
Rym: It's powering my life vehicle.

203
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:00,339
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

204
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,940
Rym: It's like I said, it's like spice.

205
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,760
Rym: Coffee gives you a minor superpower, but once you start using it, you pretty much have to keep using it for your entire life.

206
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,591
Scott: I think it's bad.

207
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:09,139
Scott: Don't do it.

208
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,418
Rym: It also tastes really good.

209
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,853
Scott: It tastes like disgusting.

210
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:12,500
Scott: Just eat hot chocolate.

211
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,460
Rym: You think a lot of things taste disgusting.

212
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,460
Scott: It just like tastes like hot chocolate, but it's been like poisoned.

213
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,339
Rym: Hot chocolate.

214
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,851
Scott: Diluted.

215
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,840
Rym: It tastes really good, but they're two very different things.

216
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,322
Scott: Yeah.

217
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:24,090
Scott: One of them is good.

218
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,160
Scott: One of them is not good.

219
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:30,020
Scott: If they were similar, if coffee tasted like hot chocolate, I would fucking drink it.

220
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,380
Rym: So I don't have any gaming news today because Scott has the gaming news I was going to do and my geek bite is part of the main bit.

221
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:39,619
Rym: But I do have a story.

222
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:41,099
Scott: Oh boy.

223
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,040
Rym: So I play a lot of Overwatch as you guys know.

224
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,880
Scott: And nobody cares.

225
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:46,659
Rym: All the Overwatch people will.

226
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,760
Rym: So last night, because the debate was on, we actually did an Overwatch and debate where we all watched the debate on one screen and played Overwatch.

227
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:54,382
Rym: Wow.

228
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:57,494
Scott: It's like, oh, this one bad thing wasn't enough.

229
00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:59,020
Scott: Let me do two bad things at once.

230
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,491
Rym: Overwatch is literally the game you've been waiting for.

231
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:02,960
Rym: You just won't play it for some reason.

232
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,687
Rym: So anyway, that's not the story.

233
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:06,751
Rym: The story is the other day.

234
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:07,735
Rym: we're playing Overwatch.

235
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:09,000
Rym: We're playing it pretty seriously.

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,172
Rym: And we're playing casual mode, meaning you can all double up.

237
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,340
Rym: Like everyone could pick the same hero if they wanted to.

238
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,208
Rym: It doesn't count for your ranking.

239
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:19,240
Rym: It's just fun, but still playing to win.

240
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,728
Rym: Like we're playing, trying to win.

241
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:22,360
Rym: Occasionally we'll double up on heroes or whatever.

242
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:24,911
Rym: And we had a really good game with this group of people.

243
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:26,619
Rym: They were really good.

244
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:30,380
Rym: So like we play a game or two with them and then the next map starts.

245
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,917
Rym: And I'm like, what if we all, like I go Bastion and someone else also goes Bastion.

246
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:35,620
Rym: That's the turret guy.

247
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:39,173
Scott: And then someone's like, hey, Rym, let me tell you about an RPG character.

248
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:40,880
Scott: So we went into the dungeon.

249
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,951
Rym: I don't know why you don't find Overwatch a wonderful game.

250
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:47,200
Rym: Like I still don't understand why you refuse to play it.

251
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,720
Scott: Even if, even if you were talking about the most wonderful game on earth right now, you're still telling me about your RPG character.

252
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:53,246
Rym: Nah, so this is good.

253
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:56,580
Rym: So I choose Bastion and then someone else also picked Bastion.

254
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,365
Rym: So I go to switch and then I'm like, wait a minute.

255
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:00,954
Rym: What if we all go Bastion?

256
00:11:01,215 --> 00:11:02,740
Rym: Which is usually kind of a weird Dick move.

257
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:04,263
Scott: Oh my God.

258
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:05,968
Scott: What if you did?

259
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:08,174
Scott: Oh, oh, I don't.

260
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:08,716
Scott: Oh my God.

261
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:09,478
Scott: That's too crazy.

262
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:10,100
Scott: That's crazy.

263
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,223
Rym: It's pretty funny.

264
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:12,528
Scott: So it's secret.

265
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,300
Rym: The other team doesn't know what you've picked until they see you.

266
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:21,180
Rym: So we all go Bastion and we like set up and we're laughing to ourselves and being dumb and like, yeah, this is going to be fucking great.

267
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,795
Scott: And then the other team all goes something else.

268
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:24,560
Scott: Oh my God.

269
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:25,362
Rym: Yeah.

270
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:29,540
Rym: So the way it happened was we're sitting there Bastioned up and no one attacks us.

271
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,465
Rym: And we're like, what's going on?

272
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:31,008
Rym: Where are they?

273
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:31,310
Rym: Why?

274
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:32,035
Rym: Why aren't they?

275
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:32,900
Rym: Cause they were super serious.

276
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,820
Scott: Oh it's legendary hall of fame material.

277
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,729
Rym: So then someone's like, okay, I see a Reinhardt.

278
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:42,320
Rym: I see, I think there's six Reinharts.

279
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,240
Rym: They had independently, we both played a bunch of games in the room.

280
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:50,560
Scott: I was playing a game and this guy, he picked rock three times in a row.

281
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,975
Scott: And then I picked paper three times in a row.

282
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:54,939
Scott: Oh my God.

283
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,786
Scott: It was crazy.

284
00:11:57,806 --> 00:11:59,052
Rym: It's a dumb baby game.

285
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:00,799
Rym: And this is a real game.

286
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:08,180
Rym: So they, but the fact that they chose to do the dumb thing, literally independently of us, the same round that we chose to do the dumb thing.

287
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:10,039
Rym: And they happen to be a counter of each other.

288
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:15,139
Rym: And that match was one of the best matches of Overwatch I have had in a long time.

289
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:16,905
Rym: All right.

290
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:18,051
Rym: I guess you can continue by cause.

291
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:18,836
Rym: what are you playing still?

292
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:19,580
Rym: Hearthstone?

293
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,101
Rym: Yeah.

294
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:21,447
Scott: Hearthstone and Pac-Man.

295
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:22,310
Scott: Yeah.

296
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:22,993
Scott: Real games.

297
00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:23,877
Rym: New Pac-Man.

298
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,791
Rym: Single player games.

299
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:26,378
Scott: Game of skill.

300
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:28,282
Rym: Yeah.

301
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:29,937
Rym: Cause Overwatch is entirely a game of luck.

302
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:35,580
Scott: It's more, it's less skilled than Pac-Man, which is 100%.

303
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,040
Rym: I would disagree with that significantly.

304
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,060
Scott: Pac-Man is 100% pure skill.

305
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:40,830
Rym: Now Pac-Man is just a memorized game.

306
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:42,037
Rym: There's nothing going on there.

307
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:42,580
Rym: Just memorize.

308
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,342
Scott: All right.

309
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:44,528
Scott: Let's see you do it.

310
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:46,920
Scott: Cause the new one is definitely not a memorized game.

311
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,061
Rym: Yeah.

312
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:47,971
Rym: The new one I'm not even going to play.

313
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:48,658
Rym: I didn't even buy it.

314
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,080
Scott: It's not a memorized game.

315
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,813
Rym: Cause I didn't even finish getting super good at Pac-Man CEDX.

316
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:54,100
Rym: I don't need more Pac-Man.

317
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,624
Scott: Well, the new one is completely different.

318
00:12:55,725 --> 00:13:00,480
Scott: I could, I only got two S ranks at the new one cause it's so balls hard and completely different in every way.

319
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,283
Rym: All right.

320
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:02,896
Rym: So if it's not memorized, then what is it?

321
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:03,360
Rym: Just random?

322
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:03,815
Scott: Skills.

323
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:04,846
Rym: Well, like what?

324
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:05,719
Rym: What kind of skills?

325
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:10,240
Scott: Uh, twitching skills, quick pattern recognizing skills.

326
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:10,732
Rym: All right.

327
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,415
Scott: Uh, keeping from, uh.

328
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,920
Rym: So it's like a baby version of an FPS that tests a very limited skill set.

329
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:18,486
Scott: Oh, you should play it and see.

330
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:18,908
Scott: Let's see.

331
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:19,069
Scott: Yeah.

332
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:21,800
Scott: If it's such a baby game, let's see you play it and get some S ranks.

333
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,780
Rym: And then you play some Overwatch.

334
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,080
Scott: Let's see you even get some A ranks.

335
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,580
Rym: Let's see you even get into the golds in Overwatch.

336
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,640
Scott: Let's see you, you know, get even an A rank at Pac-Man.

337
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,253
Rym: You want to play some Doom Deathmatch?

338
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:32,920
Rym: We'll see how that goes.

339
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:34,000
Scott: Yeah, let's not.

340
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:34,464
Scott: No?

341
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,774
Rym: How about some Quake 1 Deathmatch?

342
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:37,061
Rym: Quake 2?

343
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:38,919
Scott: Uh, Quake 1, you can't even aim up and down.

344
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:41,279
Rym: Uh, yeah, you can.

345
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,182
Scott: No.

346
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,227
Rym: Uh, yeah.

347
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,422
Rym: Did you not play Quake 1?

348
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:48,800
Scott: I played plenty of Quake 1.

349
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,403
Rym: Uh-huh.

350
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,360
Rym: I think you, anyway, you got any gaming news?

351
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:55,819
Scott: Dude, there's enormous gaming news, so.

352
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,998
Scott: *yawns* Enormous real gaming news, so.

353
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,610
Scott: The Philadelphia 76ers.

354
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:05,079
Rym: Why do we even care about, what, are they a baseball team?

355
00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:08,920
Scott: They're the worst basketball team in the entire NBA.

356
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:18,560
Scott: It's actually sad, because even though they're Philadelphia, and I would normally hate them, like the hated Phillies, the hated Eagles, I pretty much hate the worst.

357
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,099
Scott: Every professional sports team in Philadelphia is the most hated, except for the 76ers, who are so bad.

358
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,640
Scott: Well, first of all, I don't like basketball, so I don't really care, which also, which helps me hate them less.

359
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:33,017
Scott: And also, they're so bad, it's like, why would you hate them?

360
00:14:33,057 --> 00:14:33,540
Scott: They're so bad.

361
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,178
Rym: It's like when you see a puppy who's got a peanut butter jar stuck on his head, you're like, "Oh, poor

362
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:37,500
Rym: dog.".

363
00:14:37,520 --> 00:15:00,618
Scott: But they actually, the history of the Philadelphia 76ers is actually a, you know, unlike, say, the history of the Eagles, a team that has never won the Super Bowl and is full of shitheads, or, you know, the Flyers, a team that has historically been full of shitheads, the Philadelphia 76ers have a great history, full of players that are legendary and respected, like Wilt and Dr.

364
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:03,505
Scott: J. So, it's hard to hate on them.

365
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:12,560
Scott: But anyway, for every year recently, they have intentionally lost, or been accused, or they're intentionally losing, it's not even an accusation, everyone knows it.

366
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,300
Rym: In order to win, the NBA- It's the opposite of Herm Edwards, it's play to win next year.

367
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:24,365
Scott: Right, but the thing is, they keep losing, and they keep going to the NBA draft to try to get the better draft picks, and they keep losing.

368
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:27,800
Scott: It hasn't helped them enough to where they've been able to become a winning team.

369
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,320
Scott: So anyway, they have purchased, I don't even know the names or care, but they purchased some major esports teams, major ones.

370
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,300
Rym: Let's see, so they bought Team Dignitas- I've heard of them, actually.

371
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:44,500
Rym: And Team Apex.

372
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,598
Scott: I've not heard of them.

373
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:47,960
Rym: I don't know if I've heard of either one of them.

374
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:53,500
Scott: I've heard of- if you said Team Dignitas, I would say that is an esports team, I've heard of them.

375
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,380
Rym: Yeah, I think that you think that, but if someone said a similar name, would you have this vague memory?

376
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,360
Rym: Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

377
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,518
Scott: I have no memory of Team Apex.

378
00:16:01,182 --> 00:16:02,318
Rym: I might have heard of them, I don't know.

379
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:08,680
Rym: I've never felt a compelling reason to actually follow any particular esports team.

380
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:17,079
Scott: I basically just pick teams when I watch a particular esports- I think one of them could be a New York team.

381
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:18,745
Rym: Here's my heuristic.

382
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:22,080
Rym: I choose the team that acts like the evil team in the Mighty Ducks.

383
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,624
Rym: Whoever play- or the Yankees.

384
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:27,920
Rym: Whoever's the most evil and trying to win, pushing the rules to their limit.

385
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,700
Scott: So you're a fan of the New England Patriots.

386
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,689
Rym: Yeah, fucking win the game.

387
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,019
Scott: That's what I want out of my esports.

388
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,179
Scott: The New York Yankees.

389
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:35,665
Scott: Yup.

390
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,099
Scott: Where's your Yankees hat?

391
00:16:38,742 --> 00:16:39,859
Rym: Because baseball's boring.

392
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,274
Scott: Where's your Patriots?

393
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:41,640
Scott: anything?

394
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:44,760
Scott: How many players on the Patriots can you even name?

395
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:45,280
Scott: None.

396
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,360
Scott: Can you even know the name of the coach of the Patriots?

397
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,739
Rym: Why would I even know?

398
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,819
Scott: Because he is the greatest player of games alive.

399
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:55,570
Scott: And whether you're a fan of them or not, you must respect that.

400
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,600
Scott: if he played settlers, we would be in such trouble.

401
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,388
Scott: And we would be so fucked.

402
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:02,200
Scott: We are lucky that man plays football.

403
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,699
Scott: A game that we do not have to compete with him at.

404
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,940
Rym: So this is actually kind of big news because it's not the only esports team that was bought.

405
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:24,460
Scott: A day later, a group of people, including Magic Johnson and also the company that owns the Washington Capitals and a bunch of other Washington sports, bought other esports teams.

406
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,359
Scott: So it's like- Team Liquid.

407
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,497
Scott: I've heard of them.

408
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:39,140
Rym: Sold a controlling interest of the team to a group of major investors under the ownership group Axiomatic, which itself, I think, let's see, blah, blah, blah.

409
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,699
Rym: So Magic Johnson, I think they just have a stake in it?

410
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,140
Scott: Yeah, because the way in professional sports, for example, sometimes you have a person who just owns a team completely.

411
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:49,019
Scott: It's just one person.

412
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,160
Scott: But sometimes, for example, Magic Johnson, he doesn't own the LA Dodgers.

413
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,800
Scott: He owns a large portion of a company that owns the LA Dodgers, among other things.

414
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:58,660
Scott: Right?

415
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,160
Scott: So he's like, you know, he can act like he's the owner and just go to the stadium and, you know, do owner things.

416
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:04,434
Scott: Yup.

417
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,725
Scott: But he's not the sole owner.

418
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:13,359
Scott: the way that, say, you know, Robert Kraft completely 100% owns the New England Patriots on his own.

419
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:13,939
Scott: No.

420
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,945
Rym: But anyway- So this is a big deal, but it depends on how they handle it.

421
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:24,740
Rym: because are they buying these teams just to explore the space and figure out, like, what esports are?

422
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:30,480
Rym: Are they buying these teams to brand them with other teams that they own or interact with?

423
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,900
Rym: Like, will they rename one of these teams to the 76ers or the Philadelphia Somethings?

424
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:36,880
Scott: I don't think that is likely.

425
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:48,900
Scott: But I think what's going on here is, number one, it's clear that they don't actually understand the space they're getting into because, like, you know, some of these leagues, like League of Legends, you know, there's like relegation.

426
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,580
Scott: You could be buying a team and it's like that team could then become garbage.

427
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:53,650
Rym: Yeah.

428
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:58,600
Rym: It's like- It's not like buying an NHL team where they're guaranteed to at least play the regular season.

429
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:07,300
Scott: It's pretty high risk to buy an esports team if they're not like that because it's such an, you know, a nascent, you know, sort of league.

430
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:13,280
Scott: It's like you're not- it's not like you're buying the Yankees or it's like a safe bet, you know, that this is an established franchise.

431
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:22,920
Scott: You could be buying a team that will be worthless if, you know, one of those players get old and the good new players join some other team and then now this team is garbage, right?

432
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,840
Rym: There also isn't like the existing structure of how to handle, like, player contracts, free agency.

433
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:34,449
Scott: Well, you don't have these, like, established fan bases that are all stuck on one team no matter how good or bad that team is.

434
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:42,400
Scott: the way that, say, someone who lives in New York will be a fan of the Mets no matter how bad they are or how few weird series they win, you know.

435
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,979
Scott: And the Mets will always play in the major league no matter how bad they are.

436
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,199
Rym: Most esports players, like people who follow esports- And always sell a certain number of tickets no matter how bad they are.

437
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,526
Rym: Almost no one I know who follows esports really talks about teams.

438
00:19:54,546 --> 00:20:01,700
Rym: They talk about individual people on those teams or they just talk about particular games they watched in the game, like this esport that they care about.

439
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,098
Scott: Yeah, they're like, "Oh, that was an exciting match between Team A and Team B. I rarely see people have such-".

440
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:14,300
Scott: There are people who have this, but I think it's pretty rare that there are people who have such a strong allegiance to being a fan of one team no matter what.

441
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,500
Scott: Like, they're gonna- their children will inherit fandom of that team.

442
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,357
Rym: Now, for an organization like the 76ers, they could try to apply those techniques.

443
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,803
Scott: I would buy the league and not the teams.

444
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:37,460
Scott: But anyway, the thing is that's, you know, interesting though is that despite their lack of sort of knowledge of esports, they've clearly recognized the viewership numbers.

445
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:42,260
Scott: And that is why they feel this is a good investment and it's hard to argue against that.

446
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,860
Rym: And I think this is gonna suddenly accelerate.

447
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,203
Scott: The viewership numbers are huge.

448
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:55,240
Scott: It's like millions and millions of people watch these things more than are watching some of their sports and they recognize this and realize that at this time- Dude, I already think esports are bigger than baseball.

449
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:06,660
Scott: The price of an esports team is lower than its value, so it's a good investment even if those other risks come into play because it's way bigger than people realize it is.

450
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,484
Rym: Well, there's so little money involved.

451
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:14,199
Rym: Say you buy a team and you just say, "Alright, I'll pay all the players a salary to be on the

452
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:14,459
Rym: team.".

453
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:18,050
Rym: That's still less money than you would realize.

454
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:21,120
Rym: Like, that is small change to an organization like this.

455
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,880
Scott: Yeah, you can pay them less than you have to pay a basketball player.

456
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:33,060
Scott: And meanwhile, they'll still be mad rich and the number of people watching it is gonna be more than some of your basketball games or many of your basketball games.

457
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:39,510
Scott: I mean, do more people watch League of Legends final world championship than watch NBA finals?

458
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:41,573
Scott: I bet maybe they did.

459
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:46,280
Scott: I haven't looked at the numbers, but I wouldn't bet either way because it's probably close.

460
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:53,937
Rym: There's also a lot of ways this could go and I don't know what's gonna happen other than I think there's gonna be a sudden weird gold rush for teams.

461
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:55,200
Rym: I think that's gonna happen.

462
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,333
Scott: I think another major risk in esports in general is which game is hot, right?

463
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,775
Scott: Because Starcraft was the hottest.

464
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:04,920
Scott: and now League of Legends is where all the action is.

465
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:15,236
Scott: And League of Legends has been around a long time and it doesn't seem to be fading, but it's gonna fade at some point and another game is gonna take over.

466
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:17,300
Scott: It's not going to always be that game.

467
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,180
Rym: Also, because those games don't get necessarily the constant updates.

468
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,048
Scott: It could be five years, it could be ten years, it could be twenty years.

469
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:28,220
Scott: In my lifetime, it will fade and another game will become the major esports game.

470
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:37,632
Rym: As soon as someone has a bigger interest in these esports than has come up the other two, the meta will collapse pretty rapidly.

471
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:39,975
Rym: Even in Overwatch right now, the meta collapsed.

472
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,359
Rym: There's only a few heroes that people actually play in the big times.

473
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,684
Rym: Imagine if they're playing like some MOBA.

474
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:54,100
Rym: The meta will just collapse immediately on one set of heroes, one set of strategies and the game won't be able to adapt.

475
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,920
Rym: None of these games have the kind of depth that you can get from traditional sports because they rely still so much on physicality.

476
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:07,420
Rym: So, I don't know what their long-term goal is.

477
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:14,360
Scott: Well, it's a hedge against the decline as old people die of the old sports dying and losing viewership.

478
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:22,840
Scott: And when the young punk kids are the only viewership left, ESPN doesn't want to die because all the old people who watch real sports are dead.

479
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:27,850
Scott: So, ESPN already has an esports podcast.

480
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,560
Scott: They're showing esports stuff on their network and on their stream.

481
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:37,140
Scott: It's like they need some kind of content when people aren't watching baseball and whatnot anymore.

482
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:39,557
Scott: So, they're like, "Well, we can get that esports

483
00:23:39,597 --> 00:23:39,860
Scott: content.".

484
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,356
Rym: See, if I were ESPN, I would be buying leagues now.

485
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:44,240
Rym: Buy entire leagues.

486
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,380
Scott: Buy fucking games.

487
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:47,180
Rym: Yeah, buy games, buy leagues.

488
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,140
Scott: Guys, nobody's bought like Riot, the company that owns League of Legends.

489
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:53,140
Scott: I mean, it's a big company that's going to be expensive to buy.

490
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:53,866
Rym: Are they public?

491
00:23:53,886 --> 00:23:54,819
Rym: I don't know much about Riot.

492
00:23:55,803 --> 00:24:00,080
Scott: It doesn't matter because there are still companies bigger than them who could buy them, right?

493
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:04,200
Scott: I'm sure Disney could buy Riot if it wanted to.

494
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:17,179
Rym: If I were the VC guy or worked at ESPN or something and had any say in this, what I would do is buy leagues wholesale, buy game companies that make these kinds of games, and make bespoke games just for esports.

495
00:24:18,364 --> 00:24:20,300
Rym: I would make a vertical monopoly.

496
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,860
Scott: I'd start making teams associated with geographic areas.

497
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:27,840
Rym: Yeah, that's all fiddly-tackly.

498
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:34,260
Scott: People have already started making college teams and it's happening, but it's not getting that much excitement yet.

499
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,419
Rym: Well, the NCAA has to get involved there, I think.

500
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:37,760
Scott: They're not yet involved.

501
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:48,346
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

502
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:49,050
Rym: What do you got for me?

503
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,195
Scott: So there's this guy.

504
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:51,000
Scott: What's his name?

505
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,589
Scott: I don't have my thing open right now.

506
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:54,003
Scott: But anyway, it doesn't matter.

507
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:54,750
Scott: This guy's amazing.

508
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,169
Scott: He's been around for a year and I'm shocked.

509
00:24:57,991 --> 00:24:58,510
Rym: Greg Cornell.

510
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,919
Rym: He does not have more- Oh, no, that's the name of the-.

511
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:02,030
Rym: Oh, yeah, Greg Cornell.

512
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,350
Scott: Yeah, his name is Gregory Cornell.

513
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:07,630
Scott: I don't know why he doesn't have more views and more subscribers.

514
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,196
Scott: It's shocking to me.

515
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:11,470
Scott: It's unbelievable what this guy's doing.

516
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,857
Scott: It's like top-tier shit.

517
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:15,250
Scott: So what he's doing is reviewing board games.

518
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,370
Scott: The good kind of board games that we play, right?

519
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:20,602
Scott: And his reviews are okay reviews.

520
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:26,010
Scott: He's mostly showing you how the game works, which is actually really useful if you want to decide whether to buy the game or not.

521
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:29,370
Scott: The one that I watched, was it called Above and Below?

522
00:25:29,851 --> 00:25:31,310
Scott: That looks like a pretty good game.

523
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:37,650
Scott: Oh, if I wanted to have a nice little action-taking competitive game, that seems like a cute one and has a nice theme.

524
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,868
Rym: Well, actually, some of the videos that get a lot of views on our channel are the two.

525
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,890
Rym: The one we did where we teach Zendo and then we just play it for a while, and the one where we teach T&E and then we play it for a while.

526
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:52,310
Scott: This is an above-average game and is definitely an above-average game review analysis demonstration thing.

527
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:58,190
Scott: So the thing is, his video is not his face talking and it's not just bad shots of the game.

528
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,806
Rym: Like I do.

529
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:09,170
Scott: It is an extremely, extremely well-done stop-motion animation using only action figures that he then voices over.

530
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:15,610
Scott: They don't have mouths, so it's pretty easy, but I mean, as easy as stop-motion is, which is not easy at all, a huge pain in the ass.

531
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:15,935
Scott: Yup.

532
00:26:17,113 --> 00:26:18,961
Rym: I went from "Hey, I could do this" to "Fuck.

533
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:20,870
Rym: no, am I never doing this" in about two seconds.

534
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:27,410
Scott: And he's also done stop-motions of the pieces moving around to demonstrate how they move in the game and it makes it- That is the best part.

535
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:35,610
Scott: It makes it so easy to understand how the game works when you have stop-motion of the pieces moving around and it's well shot and it's so good.

536
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:39,070
Scott: The tragedy is that- Why does he only have, like, no subscribers?

537
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,430
Rym: He has, like, 800 subscribers.

538
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,810
Scott: That is not, that is like, he needs, like, three more zeroes on there.

539
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,687
Rym: Like, remember how Scott was like, "Don't back us on Patreon, back Neil

540
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:47,190
Rym: Cicierega.".

541
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:47,706
Rym: Well, you know what?

542
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:49,969
Scott: Follow this guy.

543
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:58,770
Scott: Yeah, if you listen to a GeekNights board game episode, like this podcast, and you're not watching everything on this guy's YouTube channel, what the fuck?

544
00:26:59,134 --> 00:26:59,241
Rym: Yeah.

545
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,050
Scott: Seriously?

546
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:01,490
Rym: Like, these videos are great.

547
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,570
Scott: Also, dammit, I can't steal that idea, but also, yeah, I would never would have stole that idea.

548
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,270
Rym: We could steal that idea.

549
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,128
Rym: Do you want to?

550
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,398
Scott: No.

551
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:09,950
Scott: Fuck no.

552
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:13,090
Scott: You want to sit there moving a piece around?

553
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:13,610
Scott: Take a picture.

554
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:16,330
Rym: I mean, I've- If a person has moved a piece, they can take a picture.

555
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:22,350
Scott: We have all the necessary equipment to do what this guy does, perhaps even better, only we don't have the effort.

556
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:22,838
Rym: Yup.

557
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,690
Rym: What were you saying about coffee?

558
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,590
Rym: Scott, if you drank some coffee, we could make this happen.

559
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,929
Scott: If I drank coffee, yes, I would eat this guy's lunch.

560
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:34,650
Rym: So, you might have noticed, but I guess you wouldn't have.

561
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:43,786
Rym: I stuck it at the end of the show a while ago, but I've been re-watching The Simpsons with Emily, so I've been off and on tweeting because we're watching season six, like really- The good shit.

562
00:27:45,274 --> 00:27:46,143
Rym: It is- Yeah.

563
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:51,089
Scott: The other day, I was getting the surround sound to work in VLC, and I pressed a play out of Star Wars.

564
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:53,110
Rym: That's a real dangerous idea, Scott.

565
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:53,382
Scott: Oops.

566
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,009
Scott: I Star War.

567
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:55,150
Scott: Two hours gone.

568
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,830
Rym: I remember that time at RIT, we showed someone was visiting.

569
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,150
Rym: I think it was Pete was over or something.

570
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,390
Rym: We're like, "Blah, blah, blah.

571
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:00,618
Rym: Cowboy

572
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:00,869
Rym: Bebop.".

573
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,787
Rym: He was like, "I've never seen Cowboy

574
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:01,910
Rym: Bebop.".

575
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,310
Rym: I'm like, "All right.

576
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:02,870
Rym: God damn it.

577
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,727
Rym: I'll watch the first episode right now, just so you know what the deal is,".

578
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:07,268
Rym: and then we watch the entire show.

579
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:07,519
Rym: Oops.

580
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,169
Scott: Cowboy Bebop.

581
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,386
Scott: Yup.

582
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,068
Rym: Just happens.

583
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:12,549
Scott: Luckily, I only Empire'd, and I didn't return, but maybe.

584
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:14,228
Scott: I don't know.

585
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:14,859
Scott: I got nothing to do.

586
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,449
Scott: when I get home.

587
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,090
Rym: See, at least- The thing is, Empire's my favorite one.

588
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:17,910
Scott: Is it so good?

589
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,159
Scott: Yeah.

590
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,208
Rym: It's the best one, I think.

591
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:22,469
Rym: I think it's still- I like all three.

592
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,750
Rym: Empire's the best one.

593
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,408
Scott: That Hoffio.

594
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:25,108
Rym: Oh, yeah.

595
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:28,050
Rym: As a kid, I was real obsessed with Hoff for whatever reason.

596
00:28:28,514 --> 00:28:29,189
Rym: I couldn't tell you why.

597
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:29,486
Scott: Good.

598
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,050
Scott: You can go there.

599
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,568
Scott: I'm going to the beach.

600
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:32,269
Scott: It's the exact opposite of Hoff.

601
00:28:35,091 --> 00:28:45,388
Rym: But unlike the daykillers we had at RIT, which were VHS tapes with episodes of The Simpsons with no commercials, openers, or closers, just rapid fire for eight hours, those would kill a day.

602
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:57,049
Rym: We're watching individual episodes, so the episode ends, and then I can continue with my life, but I watched the episode again where it's a parody of Cape Fear, which if you've never seen, that's a fantastic movie.

603
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,130
Scott: The Sideshow Bob episode.

604
00:28:58,514 --> 00:28:58,690
Rym: Yes.

605
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:02,470
Rym: But the episode is like a one-to-one parody of Cape Fear.

606
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,350
Rym: It's one of the funniest episodes of The Simpsons ever for a lot of reasons.

607
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,269
Scott: It's even funny if you haven't seen Cape Fear, because while I knew it was a parody of Cape Fear, I still haven't seen Cape Fear ever.

608
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,050
Scott: All I know is that Cape Fear is some kind of action movie that is a lot like that Simpsons episode.

609
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,887
Rym: It's more of a thriller than an action movie, but it's like- The Simpsons.

610
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:22,509
Rym: parodies are often like just a couple of references here and there.

611
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,850
Rym: This one is like a one-to-one.

612
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:25,890
Rym: It's kind of crazy.

613
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:26,830
Rym: But anyway.

614
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:41,129
Rym: So at the end, Bart asks Sideshow Bob to sing the entire libretto of the HMS Pinafore, and he does, and that's a plot point, and you get a bunch of snippets of him, Kelsey Grammer, actually singing the HMS Pinafore.

615
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,430
Rym: So because of that, I knew what the HMS Pinafore was as a kid.

616
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,650
Scott: I had never heard of the HMS Pinafore before seeing that episode.

617
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,206
Scott: Me either.

618
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:56,750
Scott: And all I knew after watching that episode was, "Oh, it's a musical probably about a And it's probably long.

619
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,950
Rym: It's Gilbert and Sullivan.

620
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,410
Scott: It's arguably the first- Oh, I know who they are.

621
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:00,740
Rym: Yeah.

622
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,030
Rym: Do you remember which one's which?

623
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,049
Rym: One did music, one did librettos.

624
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:05,623
Scott: I did not know that.

625
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:10,150
Scott: I thought they just sort of did every- I didn't know that there was like that kind of separation of labor.

626
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:21,030
Rym: I just learned a lot about them over the last week because apparently the HMS Pinafore is way more important than you might realize, and it might be the first modern musical of any caliber.

627
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:31,049
Rym: But because of that Simpsons episode, the snippets of songs from the HMS Pinafore have been stuck in my head, and I cannot get them out.

628
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:35,489
Rym: So I went on YouTube, and it turns out- You can just replace them with some other musical.

629
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:39,648
Scott: There's plenty to choose from.

630
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,429
Scott: This is a little more- Might I offer some King and I?

631
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,910
Rym: I think because of the motifs and the way this is put together- Some fiddling on the roof?

632
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:49,090
Rym: It's catchier than Les Mis.

633
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:51,688
Scott: No, Les Mis isn't the most catchy.

634
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,750
Rym: Remember that Seinfeld when George just keeps singing Master of the House?

635
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:56,530
Scott: That's the catchiest song in Les Mis.

636
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,610
Rym: Yeah, this is more catchy than that.

637
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:09,870
Rym: But anyway, this is not a regular performance of the HMS Pinafore because videos of stage productions like that tend to be kind of bad or just not that engaging.

638
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:24,927
Rym: This is sort of a review performance of all the music with narrations linking everything together that the BBC did in 2005, and it is of the highest quality, and you should watch the entire thing.

639
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,769
Rym: Also, if you don't get the stationary joke, I'll be very disappointed in you.

640
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:31,890
Scott: Is the whole thing on Spotify?

641
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,770
Scott: There's a lot of musical soundtracks on Spotify.

642
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:37,150
Scott: You would be shocked at how many musical soundtracks are on Spotify.

643
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,749
Rym: I found Martin Garrah on there, so I'm not shocked at all.

644
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:41,329
Scott: Your fav.

645
00:31:42,312 --> 00:31:49,290
Rym: I don't know if I particularly like Martin Garrah, but I definitely remember- Yeah, because it was very memorable.

646
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,903
Rym: It was like, "Try Hard Les Mis

647
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:53,272
Rym: 2.".

648
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:54,410
Scott: Oh, also it was your favorite.

649
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,389
Scott: It was Jekyll and Hyde also.

650
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:55,989
Rym: Oh, yeah.

651
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,889
Rym: That one's legit good.

652
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,270
Rym: Well, that's the best concept for a musical that was never turned into a real musical.

653
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,990
Scott: You want to know some interesting trivia?

654
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,666
Scott: All right.

655
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:11,010
Scott: So, Korea, I found out from watching so much Korean TV, they're obsessed with that Jekyll and Hyde musical.

656
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:11,729
Scott: Really?

657
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,941
Scott: Yeah.

658
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,769
Scott: What's that song, the main song from it?

659
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:15,425
Rym: "I Need to Know"?

660
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:16,170
Scott: Whatever.

661
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:20,270
Scott: It's like the one song from it, it comes up a lot.

662
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,730
Scott: They'll sing it all the time.

663
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,030
Scott: It's a long musical.

664
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:23,789
Rym: What kind of song?

665
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:25,890
Rym: Give me anything.

666
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,930
Scott: I forget, but they sing it all the time in Korean.

667
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:30,370
Rym: Is it an angry guy singing about murder?

668
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,010
Rym: Is it a scientist guy singing all inspirational?

669
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,830
Rym: Is it a woman singing about memories and dreams?

670
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:36,227
Scott: I don't know.

671
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,690
Scott: They don't sing the whole fucking thing.

672
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,708
Rym: They don't sing any part of it?

673
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:43,870
Scott: They're basically just, they'd say the chorus part in Korean or whatever.

674
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:45,407
Rym: That still doesn't help me.

675
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,330
Rym: There's no "the main song" in Jekyll and Hyde.

676
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:49,889
Scott: Hold on.

677
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,530
Scott: Let me look up the- In fact, depending on what version of it- Let me look up the tracklist.

678
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:55,650
Rym: It opens possibly with a different song.

679
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,370
Rym: The old concept album was the "I Need to Know" song.

680
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,030
Scott: Let me look up the soundtrack.

681
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:00,810
Scott: Musical numbers.

682
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,609
Rym: There's a lot of musical numbers in it.

683
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,670
Rym: "Alive" is when Hyde is going crazy and about to go murder people.

684
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,410
Scott: This is the moment.

685
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,210
Scott: They sing that song.

686
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,770
Rym: That song is real widely sung in the US as well.

687
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:13,010
Rym: You're hearing commercials.

688
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:16,110
Scott: Yeah, but it's like they got a thing for it.

689
00:33:16,352 --> 00:33:16,807
Scott: I don't hear them.

690
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,210
Scott: There's a lot of songs that they're way into, but that song comes up.

691
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:24,990
Scott: It's come up on multiple shows, multiple times, constantly.

692
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:34,168
Rym: The notable part about that song is that in the original concept album, the singer can hold a note longer than you would expect a human to be able to hold a note that loud, and it's kind of amazing.

693
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,250
Scott: Eh.

694
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:35,895
Rym: Eh.

695
00:33:37,252 --> 00:33:37,889
Rym: I'm into that.

696
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:39,407
Rym: Anyway, this is the entire H.O.S.

697
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,030
Rym: Pinafore.

698
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:40,364
Rym: Enjoy.

699
00:33:41,693 --> 00:33:43,510
Rym: In other news, we got no conventions till MAGFest.

700
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,410
Rym: We're actually working.

701
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,270
Rym: I don't think we can say anything about it yet, but we're setting up the panels.

702
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:57,910
Rym: We're probably going to be doing The Grind, an updated version of what we did at PAX, and a brand new one on quitting, like from games and such.

703
00:33:58,233 --> 00:33:58,448
Scott: I quit.

704
00:33:59,013 --> 00:33:59,130
Rym: Yeah.

705
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,887
Rym: You know, MAGFest is the con, unlike PAX, where we could do the joke where we just fucking walk out of the room.

706
00:34:05,471 --> 00:34:07,089
Rym: It'd be real funny if we actually didn't come back.

707
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:10,027
Rym: I wonder if MAGFest would be mad at us if we did that.

708
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:12,007
Scott: I just walked out of the room and came back.

709
00:34:13,397 --> 00:34:13,929
Rym: Oh, you're on video.

710
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,525
Rym: They'll know.

711
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:15,543
Scott: Great.

712
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,090
Rym: It ruins everything.

713
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,967
Scott: I'll give everyone a finger.

714
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:20,629
Rym: Yeah, it's in there.

715
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:22,330
Rym: My camera is there.

716
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,310
Scott: Will that get us kicked off YouTube?

717
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:24,510
Rym: No.

718
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:25,710
Scott: It's your YouTube account.

719
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,650
Rym: Unless I get my dick out, I don't think we'll be fine.

720
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:29,850
Scott: Oh, I can just get my dick out on your YouTube account.

721
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:30,266
Scott: That'd be great.

722
00:34:31,313 --> 00:34:32,929
Rym: If you really want to, you're welcome to.

723
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,489
Rym: I'm just going to stop looking at this monitor.

724
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:47,685
Scott: I mean, the only reason I actually wear clothes is A, warmth, B, protection from elements, and C, you know, it's like, I don't care if anyone sees my junk, but I think they got a nude beach respect because they don't want to see my job

725
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:48,690
Rym: at a nude beach.

726
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:58,190
Rym: I might do a little bit of nude swimming, but I am never in my life going to risk a sunburn on the young master and his married gentlemen.

727
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,149
Scott: Well, imagine, are you going to rub sun tan, you know, block on your junk?

728
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:04,490
Rym: Not while I'm at the beach.

729
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:11,749
Scott: And the thing is, it's like, you know, I don't mind being naked at the beach, but I, I'm pretty sure other people don't want to see my junk, which is why I don't.

730
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:12,521
Rym: Yeah.

731
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,270
Rym: But I'm mostly protecting the boys.

732
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,550
Scott: If people told me like, Hey, Scott, we want to see your junk.

733
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,589
Rym: I'd be like, all right, if you want to also, you know, just getting older, they, they need a lot more support than they used to.

734
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,850
Scott: So it's kind of unpleasant to have these DC brought that up multiple times.

735
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,730
Scott: I think you're having some problems because I don't have these problems.

736
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:28,828
Rym: It'll come.

737
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:30,002
Rym: Uh huh.

738
00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:30,530
Rym: Yeah.

739
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:33,509
Rym: There'll be a little more room down there as time goes on.

740
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,429
Rym: I mean, you're younger than me, so you're not there yet.

741
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:37,629
Scott: Three months, three months younger.

742
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,370
Rym: So uh, yeah, we got nothing.

743
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:46,110
Rym: The book club book, which I assume Scott hasn't started reading yet because you have not updated the website.

744
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,290
Scott: Well, I had to tell you something about the book club book.

745
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,048
Scott: So I haven't seen them.

746
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:55,050
Scott: I, you know, I saw the movie twice in my think, but it was many years, many years ago that I saw it.

747
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,550
Scott: So I don't remember too much cause my memory is not good.

748
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:03,069
Scott: But as I'm reading the book, like memories of the movie keep coming back, but I can't tell.

749
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:08,889
Scott: Are they real memories or are they, are they false memories with the actors and actresses from the movie?

750
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:10,827
Scott: I don't know.

751
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,808
Rym: Well, I mean like I remember I fucking conflated this movie with some other movie.

752
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:19,967
Rym: that is in no way related to it, but anyway, uh, yeah, I started reading it.

753
00:36:21,174 --> 00:36:22,310
Rym: So I guess you can update the website.

754
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,870
Scott: I'm trying to update the whole website.

755
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,607
Scott: It's a pain in the ass.

756
00:36:25,131 --> 00:36:28,229
Rym: You can at least make the post about the book club book.

757
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:34,265
Rym: So, uh, yeah, other than that, uh, I guess PAX South is in the horizon.

758
00:36:34,465 --> 00:36:44,885
Rym: distantly PAX East is going to come up not too long after that, uh, then PAX Prime, uh, we're thinking about maybe going to gamer X, even if we don't do a panel of us go to it cause it's in New York.

759
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:46,948
Rym: So stay tuned for all that.

760
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,990
Scott: I still don't know if that's a thing that we're supposed to go to not being gay.

761
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:55,790
Rym: I was invited to submit panels for it and it's not about gay games.

762
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:58,650
Rym: It's just a friendly convention.

763
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,688
Scott: I mean, yeah, that is primarily about games, but it's like I'm taking a ticket away from someone who is.

764
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,769
Scott: So it's like, is that right?

765
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:06,685
Rym: I don't think it sells out.

766
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:09,649
Rym: Well, that's pretty sure it doesn't sell out.

767
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:18,589
Scott: If you are a person who plays games of any kind and is of a non straight sexual orientation, you should go to this.

768
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,488
Scott: Cause it's a good convention.

769
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:20,863
Rym: Yeah.

770
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:21,930
Rym: We will probably be there.

771
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,069
Rym: It's a new, I'll go to pretty much any con that's in New York.

772
00:37:24,553 --> 00:37:27,210
Rym: I mean, uh, there's that new anime con coming next year.

773
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,350
Rym: We'll definitely be at that.

774
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,089
Scott: I guess we'll go and see what the deal is.

775
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,930
Rym: I think that was going to be a lot bigger and better than the much smaller one.

776
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,849
Rym: We, I said we were going to go to, and then I forgot about the thing that was near the hotel near my work.

777
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,090
Rym: Yeah.

778
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:47,830
Scott: The one where I was like, oh, I guess I clearly a garbage con, but I was, that was a weird day cause I walked out of my office and there was a cosplayer and I was like, oh, oh, and then I was like, oh right.

779
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,470
Scott: Is that tiny shit convention anyway?

780
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,962
Rym: Yeah.

781
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,470
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

782
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,528
Rym: Otherwise that's it.

783
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,350
Rym: Patreon's going, we got YouTube channels.

784
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,829
Rym: This episode is streaming live on YouTube right now.

785
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,047
Rym: So you could have watched this live, including all the stuff in between when we actually do the bits.

786
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,488
Scott: You're better off not doing so.

787
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,230
Rym: So deep sea adventure.

788
00:38:12,153 --> 00:38:14,069
Rym: This is a real simple game.

789
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:17,230
Rym: It's a Japanese indie tabletop game.

790
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:26,549
Scott: Our friend Chris has gotten obsessed with the Japanese board game industry, so he's getting lots of Japanese games and including this one, which is a good one.

791
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,989
Rym: They're real hit or miss.

792
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,010
Rym: Like all games are like all indie type board games.

793
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:32,990
Scott: Some of them have amazing aspects.

794
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,421
Scott: Like there's a game called Buddha bevel, which is not a great game.

795
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:45,450
Scott: It's basically just sort of like a vote who wins really fast, but the instruction manual is so gloriously hilarious in its English.

796
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:46,569
Scott: It is amazing.

797
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,350
Scott: And also the concept God with your tower that is too tall.

798
00:38:51,774 --> 00:38:52,481
Scott: You want to win the game.

799
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,250
Scott: You have to build the tower of Babel.

800
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:58,910
Scott: That is the tallest, but isn't too tall because then it offends God.

801
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:05,570
Rym: It's uh, I feel like there's a really good game there, but it didn't quite execute, but deep sea adventure final judgment.

802
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:16,645
Rym: Oh, so the other common theme I'm picking up on because I see other people complaining about this too, is that for whatever reason, Japanese indie tabletop people can't seem to write rules very well.

803
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,830
Scott: I'm sure they probably well written some of them at least.

804
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:27,490
Scott: I mean, I've read multiple people in English can't write rules well, but I'm sure if we knew, you know, Emily read the rules, she could tell us a better ruling than the English.

805
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,910
Rym: So from what I have gathered, that does not appear to be the case.

806
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:36,090
Rym: The rules are just not as tight as I would expect from a game in general.

807
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,410
Rym: But Kickstarter games have the exact same problem.

808
00:39:39,992 --> 00:39:41,650
Scott: I mean, games period have this problem.

809
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,250
Scott: People don't write game rules tightly and well.

810
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,646
Rym: It seems like the only games that don't have this problem are the like.

811
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:52,949
Scott: the people who write game rules well are rules lawyers and rules lawyers are usually bad at designing games.

812
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,650
Rym: It's Rainer Canizia and a few other people are the only people who write good game rules.

813
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,349
Scott: Or people with lots of editors.

814
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:58,963
Scott: Yeah.

815
00:39:59,171 --> 00:39:59,910
Scott: At big publishers.

816
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,050
Scott: But even they fuck it up a lot.

817
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:07,609
Rym: Deep Sea Adventure is so simple and so quick and I always introduce it to people as the drowning game.

818
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,050
Rym: It's a drowning simulator.

819
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:09,650
Rym: Let's go.

820
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,290
Scott: That's correct.

821
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,590
Rym: Basically you get a bunch of, I mean, it has a conceit and the conceit is pretty funny.

822
00:40:14,991 --> 00:40:20,630
Rym: You're a bunch of shithead treasure hunters who all hate each other, but you're also poor.

823
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:23,690
Rym: So you get together and rent a terrible submarine.

824
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:30,949
Scott: You're all in the same submarine together with the same and you only have one air tank, but you want to get more treasure than the other people because you're not sharing on your turn.

825
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:31,730
Scott: You're sharing the submarine.

826
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,609
Scott: You're not sharing a treasure.

827
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:34,650
Rym: There's a shared set of air on your turn.

828
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,610
Rym: You go down and there's all these tiles.

829
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:37,550
Scott: No one had.

830
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,910
Scott: No one takes a tank with them.

831
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,010
Scott: Everyone's just got a hose connected to the submarine.

832
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,510
Scott: So if you breathe too much air, you will kill everybody.

833
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:49,970
Rym: So as long as you're going down and not picking up any treasure, a game just goes on forever.

834
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:58,450
Rym: Just do whatever you want and your options on the turn is you decide if you're going to continue going down or you're going to fucking bail and run back up to that submarine.

835
00:40:58,934 --> 00:40:59,890
Rym: Then you roll some dice.

836
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:07,110
Rym: You roll 2D3 to figure out how far you move in the direction you chose and then you can choose whether or not to pick up treasure on that spot.

837
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:09,648
Rym: The treasures get better the deeper you go.

838
00:41:10,191 --> 00:41:17,990
Rym: However, as soon as you've picked up treasure, every time it gets to your turn, the air goes down by the number of treasures you are holding, and that applies to every player.

839
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,810
Scott: There's one more thing that makes it even worse.

840
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,550
Scott: So if I'm holding one treasure on my turn, the air goes down by one.

841
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,749
Scott: There's only 30 airs.

842
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,754
Scott: If you got a lot of players, it's hard to 25.

843
00:41:27,754 --> 00:41:28,609
Scott: It's not a lot of errors.

844
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:30,050
Rym: Not a lot of errors at all.

845
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:34,827
Scott: But anyway, uh, then, you know, when you roll the dice to move, remember it's 2D3.

846
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,448
Scott: You don't move a lot.

847
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:40,290
Scott: You subtract one from your total movement for every treasure you're holding.

848
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:48,230
Scott: So if I roll the best possible roll, a six and I'm holding two treasures, I only move four spaces molding two treasures and I roll a one or a two.

849
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:54,829
Scott: I don't move and my turn goes past the rules like to point out if you still use two air from holding two treasures.

850
00:41:55,851 --> 00:42:05,390
Rym: And that is key because if the air runs out after the players turn and ended the air, anyone who's not on the boat drops all their treasure to the bottom of the ocean and dies.

851
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,310
Rym: And then you play again, you play three rounds.

852
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:12,308
Scott: The submarine goes back to the surface, so anyone who's in it survives even though they ran out of air.

853
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:21,230
Rym: There's a little bit more about how you can just drop treasure and try to race back for the boat and how the lot like there's also positioning based on the other people.

854
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,969
Scott: So when you move, if you step on someone else, you just sort of fast forward right past them.

855
00:42:25,471 --> 00:42:30,910
Scott: So if there's a bunch of people in front of you, it's really easy to get to the bottom of the ocean quickly to get more fancy treasures.

856
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:35,850
Scott: But if there's not a lot of people behind you, it's really hard to go back up to that.

857
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:40,106
Scott: You need people in front of you, whichever way you're going to move quickly with a low roll.

858
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,830
Scott: So you want people to be close to you, but in front of you on your way back to the submarine so you can get up there quickly.

859
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:53,690
Rym: Now this game, if everyone knows how to play it, five minutes tops to play an entire game.

860
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,910
Scott: The thing that takes the longest amount of time is the dice rolling.

861
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,225
Rym: Yep.

862
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,929
Rym: Maybe 10 minutes.

863
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,970
Rym: Teaching the game takes about two minutes and people just kind of get it.

864
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,970
Rym: And everyone I've shown this game to, because I own it now, really likes it.

865
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,989
Rym: Like everyone I've ever introduced this to and I had them play it, they just got.

866
00:43:09,009 --> 00:43:15,810
Scott: really You can basically have all the fun of playing like infiltration is 90% of the fun of playing infiltration.

867
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,190
Rym: I hate to say it, I think this is better than infiltration.

868
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:26,549
Scott: I mean, because it's- Well, I think infiltration has some complexities and some, you know, meh parts, which make it sort of less pure and less good.

869
00:43:26,932 --> 00:43:30,110
Scott: But it has a little bit more fun because it has extra bits like secrets.

870
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:35,668
Rym: Well it has the fun and the theme, but it also has this meta of, it always goes kind of the same way.

871
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,150
Rym: There's only two options on how that game goes.

872
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:47,950
Scott: But anyway, so yeah, you can basically have all, you know, I think in terms of fun per minute per dollar per unit, it's better than infiltration.

873
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:48,270
Scott: This

874
00:43:48,311 --> 00:43:59,469
Rym: is like the perfect bust it out while you're waiting for the last person to come back from the bathroom to start a real game or bust it out when you're at a con and the room closes in a half hour and you can just get one more game out of the

875
00:43:59,509 --> 00:43:59,590
Scott: way.

876
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,330
Scott: Or bust it out if you're on a literal submarine and you're divers.

877
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,430
Rym: Bust it out like at the table at a restaurant.

878
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:16,450
Rym: So the thing I have noticed also is that when you play this game with people who haven't played it a bunch, almost everyone dies or everyone dies the first two rounds.

879
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:21,468
Rym: This game, like everything's going fine and it's just, you know, it's a press your luck game.

880
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:23,330
Rym: So should I keep going?

881
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:23,930
Rym: Should I keep going?

882
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:24,549
Rym: Everything's fine.

883
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:28,329
Rym: As soon as one person decides to turn back, all hell breaks loose.

884
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,849
Rym: As soon as one person picks up two treasures, all hell breaks loose.

885
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:37,230
Rym: The game is all about leaving Scott to drown at the bottom of the ocean as fast as possible.

886
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:41,310
Scott: Hopefully you're not the one who's at the deepest part of the ocean when people start turning around, right?

887
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:47,569
Scott: If you're at the deepest part of the ocean, you should turn around first so that you get, you know, it's like, I'm, I'm the deepest right now.

888
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:55,050
Scott: I will grab a treasure, turn around and I'll get a pretty good role cause everyone else is right behind me and then I'll be on my way back and it'll be good times.

889
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:55,908
Rym: I've had a strategy.

890
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:59,970
Scott: If you're at the deepest part of the ocean and everyone else turns back and then it's your turn again.

891
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,330
Scott: Now this is a big gap behind you.

892
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,347
Scott: It's like, wait for me.

893
00:45:02,611 --> 00:45:03,088
Scott: And now you're dead.

894
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:11,930
Rym: If I'm way too shallow, like I'm near the submarine going down and other people have picked up multiple treasures, I just immediately turn around and pick up all the shit treasures on my way out just to try to kill everybody.

895
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:12,427
Scott: Yeah.

896
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,949
Scott: There's plenty of strategies like this.

897
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:14,206
Scott: Yeah.

898
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:17,350
Rym: It's that there's, there's a lot of depth to this game.

899
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:27,630
Rym: Oh, despite how simple it is and I really like it and it's just like if you, if you're the kind of person who plays board games with people, this is like a must have in your library.

900
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,650
Rym: So in general, I mean it's a press your luck game.

901
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,350
Rym: It's one of, it's almost a pure press your luck game.

902
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,170
Scott: There's plenty of press your luck games is like a, you know, fresh fish is a press your luck game in many ways.

903
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,550
Rym: To a degree, but it's much more obscured and complex, right?

904
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,750
Scott: The press your luck is only one aspect of it, right?

905
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,630
Scott: But there's a no thanks is a press your luck game in many ways.

906
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,209
Rym: Press your luck is a press your luck game.

907
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:50,410
Scott: Yeah.

908
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,367
Scott: The game show on TV.

909
00:45:51,911 --> 00:45:55,189
Scott: Except if you figure out the pattern and you're not, the luck component goes away.

910
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:00,389
Rym: And press your luck is also a core, like it is a mechanic, either core or just sort of part of the game.

911
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,162
Rym: Like it's part of way more games that you might realize.

912
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:04,810
Scott: infiltration we just mentioned.

913
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:17,768
Rym: because all it really means is that you generally have the option like a real, usually a really simple dial where you can dial up your risk and it, yeah, and it dials up the reward at the same time.

914
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,168
Scott: Yeah.

915
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:23,130
Scott: You can just, you know, a lot of games can buy reward potential with risk, right?

916
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:29,850
Scott: In most games out there, you know, you're always making these sort of decisions based on a risk reward analysis sort of thing, right?

917
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:31,750
Scott: Like aha, I've got three moves available.

918
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:34,750
Scott: There's the risky move that has a big reward.

919
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:36,630
Scott: There's a risky move with a shitty reward.

920
00:46:36,732 --> 00:46:37,429
Scott: Forget that one.

921
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:49,730
Scott: And there's a conservative move with an okay reward and you can sort of choose to, but a press your luck game is different in that you can choose pretty much anywhere along the scale of risk and reward.

922
00:46:50,112 --> 00:46:54,230
Scott: It's like a free roaming, you know, needle, not just concrete actions.

923
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:58,170
Scott: And you can, you know, keep pressing.

924
00:46:58,651 --> 00:47:04,089
Scott: And then at some point you flip and you know, this is sort of this movement of increasing the risk.

925
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:10,309
Scott: And so you stop and turn around and give up on the risk, you know, like a dealer, no deal and things like that.

926
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:19,947
Rym: Now, pressing your luck, like it's in most games where they realized or not like even wizard has a heavy press your luck mechanic or at least a component because once you're behind, you're not going to win.

927
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,610
Rym: You can, you got to go for increasingly desperate strategies to try to catch up.

928
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:28,630
Rym: So you just dial the risk all the way up in the last round.

929
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:30,369
Rym: You're like, yeah, I'm taking 10 tricks.

930
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:36,969
Rym: You just go for it even though you've got almost no chance because that's a conventional heuristic of almost all games.

931
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:46,410
Rym: If you're losing, you want to increase randomness or take on additional risk to attempt to get a greater reward because you play conservatively and you're behind.

932
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,749
Rym: You're guaranteed to stay behind.

933
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:59,048
Rym: Like you can't overtake someone with a conservative strategy if they're ahead of you because they're going to play a conservative strategy and at best you'll maintain your current negative lead.

934
00:47:59,090 --> 00:47:59,250
Scott: Right.

935
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:04,670
Scott: So the hallmark of a game that's specifically a press your luck game is the turnaround point.

936
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:12,410
Scott: At which point do you stop increasing the, you know, it's like, okay, Rym one out of two chance of making a dollar.

937
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:13,229
Scott: Okay, I'll do it.

938
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:13,710
Scott: All right.

939
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:14,410
Scott: Now you have to bet.

940
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:17,290
Scott: You have to go all in on every bet or not bet.

941
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:20,470
Scott: So the four chance, the next one is a lot of four chance.

942
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,230
Scott: The next one's one out of eight, 16.

943
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:27,868
Scott: It's like, at what point do you say, all right, I'm just going to keep my money and I'm not going to go all in again.

944
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:28,470
Scott: Right.

945
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:30,070
Scott: How do you make this decision?

946
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:39,292
Scott: It's like, you know, you've already, you know, it's like obviously no matter what the odds are in any game, you're going all in on the very first bet, even if the odds are really small.

947
00:48:39,352 --> 00:48:45,110
Scott: because it's like, if you don't win the first bet, you're, you're zero, which is what you can't have less than zero.

948
00:48:45,554 --> 00:48:46,409
Scott: It's like turn one.

949
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:51,527
Rym: Like a PR a pure conservative strategy and wizard would be to always bid zero unless you have wizards.

950
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:52,190
Scott: Sure.

951
00:48:52,410 --> 00:49:00,370
Rym: Like, yeah, you're not going to like, you'll get your two points every round probably, but you're not going to win if anyone takes even, and you're also going to take tricks by accident.

952
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:01,027
Scott: Actually lose.

953
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:01,769
Rym: Maybe.

954
00:49:02,431 --> 00:49:05,843
Rym: Yeah, but it's easier to avoid a trick than to take.

955
00:49:05,903 --> 00:49:09,530
Scott: you would never in deep sea adventure or infiltration on the first turn.

956
00:49:09,772 --> 00:49:11,850
Scott: Just leave and be like, Oh, back in the submarine.

957
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:12,249
Scott: Yup.

958
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,549
Scott: That there's no reason to do that.

959
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:20,769
Scott: You might as well at least go out, get the first thing, you know, go in infiltration, go out, pick up one day to token and go back.

960
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:21,510
Rym: So there's two things.

961
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,790
Rym: On one hand it's, are you behind or not?

962
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:24,990
Rym: Like the further behind you are.

963
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:25,548
Rym: Yeah, fuck it.

964
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:26,468
Rym: Like full sail.

965
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:33,588
Rym: But there's also the, before anyone has made a full declaration, like I step out and take a little more risk.

966
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,310
Rym: And then Scott sees it took a little more risk and he also takes a little more risk.

967
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:36,968
Rym: Like let's go.

968
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:41,370
Rym: Like this game is totally safe until someone starts picking up treasure.

969
00:49:42,671 --> 00:49:49,749
Rym: So at what point do you pick up the treasure and be that guy who caused the game to enter the collapsing state?

970
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:53,570
Scott: You have to handle it because everyone else takes their turn before you take your turn, right?

971
00:49:53,650 --> 00:50:00,530
Scott: So they could all turn back and then you're the last person to turn back, which could suck unless you're already the person who is in the rear.

972
00:50:00,891 --> 00:50:03,010
Scott: In which case then it's kind of okay because you'll be right.

973
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:03,411
Scott: This

974
00:50:03,451 --> 00:50:04,959
Rym: is why in a lot of games you'll see,

975
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:14,670
Scott: so if you're all the way in the rear, you have to look at the layout of people based on the dice they've rolled and say, okay, if I roll, how likely is it that I will end up all the way in the front?

976
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,429
Scott: Because if that happens, everyone else will turn back and I'll be in deep shit.

977
00:50:18,912 --> 00:50:22,370
Scott: So if I can sort of land in the middle of everyone, that would be okay.

978
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:35,189
Scott: I would go deeper, but if I can't do that, I should turn back now and leave them behind and make it harder for them to get back to increase, you know, and maybe take two treasures on the way back to make up for the fact that it didn't go as deep as they did.

979
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,890
Rym: Now it's a really satisfying mechanic and that's part of why I bring up deep sea adventure.

980
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:57,130
Rym: If you want to really sort of study how this works and what this does to bigger, more complex games like say infiltration, play the hell out of deep sea adventure because you'll see people, despite how really simple this game is, get surprisingly invested in it and that is like, that's one of the reasons why press your luck is such a powerful mechanic.

981
00:50:57,492 --> 00:50:59,150
Rym: It causes you people to get invested.

982
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:07,409
Rym: The more you've risked, even if you're not going to win anymore, like I've seen people play this game, everyone else turned back and someone else like in the third round is behind.

983
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:08,246
Rym: Fuck it.

984
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:13,410
Rym: They go way deep and sometimes they almost make it out almost, almost unlikely.

985
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:21,690
Scott: Yeah, but while there have been times, for example, where people who are trying to make it out, made it out faster than they thought.

986
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:28,309
Scott: So once they're out, they're not using up the air anymore and this person is like left outside and the only air they're using is their own.

987
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:28,870
Scott: Yeah.

988
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:31,189
Scott: They have complete control over what's going on.

989
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:34,948
Scott: It's not like the other people can come out of the submarine and breathe some air and use it up.

990
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:41,170
Scott: So now they know exactly like whether they can get back or not, if they should put treasures down or pick them up or what.

991
00:51:41,914 --> 00:51:44,630
Scott: And now they can score with like a really deep treasure.

992
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:53,970
Rym: So some games like this almost have a sort of coalition building where there's the coalition of people who are continuing to press forward into deeper risk and the separate coalition.

993
00:51:54,070 --> 00:52:00,810
Rym: These are just implied coalitions of people who are turned back, who have decided the risk enough and are bailing.

994
00:52:01,432 --> 00:52:05,690
Rym: And depending on which of those is the majority is a big part of the dynamic of the game.

995
00:52:06,392 --> 00:52:09,830
Rym: And then you'll see that exact same thing play out in infiltration, for example.

996
00:52:10,232 --> 00:52:13,050
Rym: But there's all this other stuff sort of obscuring it.

997
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:19,589
Rym: Like it obscures the risk reward, even though really infiltration, not much more deep than deep sea adventure.

998
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,406
Scott: Oh, there's a bit of randomness going on.

999
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:26,406
Rym: A lot more randomness, but also like most of the things are not nearly as powerful as you'd expect them to be.

1000
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:38,010
Rym: And you're very rarely rewarded for going super deep, but the game rewards you with these other things like theme and mystery, and you really want to see what those cards are if you go deeper.

1001
00:52:43,771 --> 00:52:45,890
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1002
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:51,029
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.

1003
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:56,450
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1004
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,370
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1005
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:04,130
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1006
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:07,646
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1007
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:11,950
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1008
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:15,070
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1009
00:53:56,343 --> 00:54:05,060
Rym: For those of you who might not be paying attention to the Patreon, I read the entire first chapter of Castlevania II, Worlds of Power.

1010
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,057
Rym: I have multiple physical copies of this book by FX9.

1011
00:54:09,305 --> 00:54:12,280
Rym: For the patrons only, I read Chapter 2.

1012
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,119
Rym: I'm going to read a chapter every week or so until I finish this book.

1013
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,406
Rym: And that's a good thing.

1014
00:54:18,446 --> 00:54:24,060
Rym: now, I'm just going to read these amazing Worlds of Power books to all of you who are supporting us on Patreon.

1015
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:32,920
Rym: So the weird thing I have for you today as a preview, even though this is otherwise only in the Patreon, is Chapter 2 of Simon's Quest.

1016
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,785
Rym: It is titled, I believe, Simon, Chapter 2, Simon.

1017
00:54:44,871 --> 00:54:48,470
Rym: "Hi Tim," said the cutest girl in junior high to Tim Bradley.

1018
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:53,729
Rym: Janet Morrison told me you could give me some good tips on where to get discount rates on video game cartridges.

1019
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,150
Rym: My brother's birthday is coming up and I need to buy him a nice present.

1020
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,830
Rym: Blink of chocolate brown eyes.

1021
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:02,630
Rym: A smile so brilliant it dazzled Tim's brain.

1022
00:55:02,771 --> 00:55:05,029
Rym: From cerebrum to cerebellum.

1023
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:05,874
Rym: Wow.

1024
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,830
Rym: He'd always liked Carol Jan since he'd started here at Howard Junior High last year.

1025
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:21,287
Rym: And though they shared homeroom and Carol was nice enough to acknowledge his existence, unlike the more socially conscious teenage females who shunned him, she'd never actually sought him out.

1026
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:22,789
Rym: For advice yet.

1027
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:28,041
Rym: Tim Bradley looked around him at the rest of the homeroom class at the hand of the clock close to the 830 bell.

1028
00:55:29,311 --> 00:55:31,710
Rym: How come everyone wasn't watching the momentous occasion?

1029
00:55:32,132 --> 00:55:36,709
Rym: How come there weren't trumpets and firecrackers and streamers flying through the air just like on New Year's Eve?

1030
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:42,129
Rym: Um, well, Blockbuster Discount has a real good sale on them now, actually.

1031
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:45,248
Rym: Carol sure smelled nice, too.

1032
00:55:45,891 --> 00:55:48,150
Rym: He realized he'd never been this close to her before.

1033
00:55:48,591 --> 00:55:50,810
Rym: And it was not an unpleasant experience.

1034
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,310
Rym: Tim Bradley didn't normally notice girls much.

1035
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:56,690
Rym: There were far more important things to be thinking about in his life.

1036
00:55:57,051 --> 00:56:03,170
Rym: However, with her brunette good looks perking just inches from him, he certainly noticed Carol.

1037
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:09,590
Rym: And it was an experience with every bit the excitement of a nervous moment in the middle of a game of Zelda.

1038
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:11,328
Rym: "Oh, good," she said.

1039
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:14,110
Rym: But then a small cloud dimmed her smile.

1040
00:56:14,633 --> 00:56:15,108
Rym: "Oh, dear.

1041
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:20,710
Rym: I haven't the faintest idea where Blockbuster Discount is," she smiled glowingly again.

1042
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:25,229
Rym: "I don't suppose you'd be willing to take me there this afternoon, would

1043
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:25,390
Rym: you?".

1044
00:56:26,492 --> 00:56:28,990
Rym: "Um, sure, sure, Carol.

1045
00:56:29,672 --> 00:56:31,509
Rym: I'd be more than happy to take you there.

1046
00:56:31,932 --> 00:56:33,450
Rym: It's not that far away from the school.

1047
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,407
Rym: I mean, it's so close that we could just

1048
00:56:35,468 --> 00:56:35,589
Rym: walk.".

1049
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:40,930
Rym: "Magnificent," she grabbed his forearm and squeezed it with enthusiasm.

1050
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:46,223
Rym: "See you at the flagpole outside the main entrance at 3 15 p.m It's a

1051
00:56:46,284 --> 00:56:46,509
Rym: date.".

1052
00:56:47,472 --> 00:56:55,309
Rym: She gave his arm another squeeze, and she was off in a flurry of skirt, fluffy blouse, swirling hair, and that wonderful flowery perfume.

1053
00:56:56,061 --> 00:56:56,469
Rym: A date.

1054
00:56:57,451 --> 00:57:00,430
Rym: A date with Carol Jantz, 8th grade beauty.

1055
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:06,370
Rym: It all sounded okay to Tim Bradley, especially since it involved video games.

1056
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:08,989
Rym: That was something he could talk about.

1057
00:57:09,531 --> 00:57:11,049
Rym: He'd have problems with the other stuff.

1058
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:17,030
Rym: Still, it wasn't a date date, not like a movie at the mall or anything formal like that.

1059
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:21,910
Rym: It was just him and Carol going to Blockbuster's, looking for bargains, right?

1060
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:27,510
Rym: But the way his heart was beating, you would have thought she'd asked him to the junior prom.

1061
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,029
Rym: The bell rang.

1062
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:36,090
Rym: Tim pucked up his books and drifted out into the hallway through the flow of noisy teams, elbowing and clomping toward first-period classes.

1063
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:39,390
Rym: The odor of chalk dust and floor wax filled the halls.

1064
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:49,690
Rym: Tim was fantasizing about kicking through a hot game of Double Dragon, Carol Jantz by his side, when he ran smack into Burt Alvin by the boys' room.

1065
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,786
Rym: "It was like running into a

1066
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:52,129
Rym: truck.".

1067
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:57,570
Rym: "Hey," said the 9th grader, frowning down on him from about 20 stories above.

1068
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:02,630
Rym: Tim peered up at the heights from the level of Burt Alvin's chest to his chiseled features above.

1069
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:03,435
Rym: "Hey,

1070
00:58:03,516 --> 00:58:03,963
Rym: Bradley.".

1071
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:04,650
Rym: "Huh?"

1072
00:58:05,452 --> 00:58:06,099
Rym: "What's this about?

1073
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:06,806
Rym: a date with my

1074
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:07,090
Rym: girl?".

1075
00:58:07,898 --> 00:58:08,148
Rym: "Date?

1076
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:09,075
Rym: Girl?

1077
00:58:09,993 --> 00:58:11,790
Rym: Yeah, you know, as in female.

1078
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:12,570
Rym: Pretty?

1079
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:13,590
Rym: Carol.

1080
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:14,913
Rym: Mine.".

1081
00:58:15,571 --> 00:58:19,510
Rym: Each of the last four words was accompanied by a hard poke from the forefinger.

1082
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:20,428
Rym: Uh-oh.

1083
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:21,630
Rym: Tim had forgotten.

1084
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,130
Rym: Carol had a boyfriend.

1085
00:58:24,872 --> 00:58:26,049
Rym: A big boyfriend.

1086
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:28,910
Rym: Maybe she was getting ready to dump him, though.

1087
00:58:29,431 --> 00:58:29,869
Rym: No matter.

1088
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:34,610
Rym: Tim was still dead meat if Donkey Kong here thought he was trespassing on his territory.

1089
00:58:35,336 --> 00:58:35,585
Rym: "Oh, that?

1090
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:36,829
Rym: Uh, gee, Burt.

1091
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:39,027
Rym: She just wants me to take her shopping for video

1092
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:39,270
Rym: games.".

1093
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:43,549
Rym: "The video jockey wants to ride off into the sunset with my girl, huh?

1094
00:58:43,873 --> 00:58:44,909
Rym: Well, pal, let me tell you.

1095
00:58:45,411 --> 00:58:49,189
Rym: I'm perfectly capable of taking Carol to any store she wants to go to.

1096
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:54,084
Rym: But I tell you, I feel like putting you out of commission just for thinking about going out with my

1097
00:58:54,146 --> 00:58:54,330
Rym: girl.".

1098
00:58:55,235 --> 00:58:55,808
Rym: "What to do?

1099
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:56,300
Rym: What to

1100
00:58:56,363 --> 00:58:56,446
Rym: do?".

1101
00:58:57,256 --> 00:58:57,749
Rym: "Look, Burt.

1102
00:58:58,253 --> 00:58:59,790
Rym: I was just headed into the boys' room.

1103
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,007
Rym: Can we, uh, discuss this when I'm

1104
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:02,330
Rym: finished?".

1105
00:59:03,492 --> 00:59:04,709
Rym: Burt glared at him.

1106
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:06,268
Rym: "Yeah, I guess so.

1107
00:59:06,691 --> 00:59:09,749
Rym: I don't want you having any accidents while I'm pulverizing

1108
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:09,870
Rym: you.".

1109
00:59:10,612 --> 00:59:12,310
Rym: "That's, uh, very thoughtful of you, Burt.

1110
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,604
Rym: Which reminds me of a funny joke I heard the other

1111
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:14,826
Rym: day.".

1112
00:59:15,431 --> 00:59:17,450
Rym: Tim Bradley loved jokes.

1113
00:59:17,851 --> 00:59:18,947
Rym: He loved puns, too.

1114
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:22,290
Rym: And like he always said, the badder the better.

1115
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,221
Rym: "Why does the chicken cross the

1116
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:24,746
Rym: bathroom?".

1117
00:59:25,231 --> 00:59:25,769
Rym: "Move it, man.

1118
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:27,107
Rym: I'll be waiting for you right

1119
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:27,290
Rym: here.".

1120
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,910
Rym: Tim pushed through the swinging door.

1121
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:33,670
Rym: He went to a sink, ran cold water, and splashed it on his face.

1122
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,010
Rym: Boy oh boy oh boy was he in trouble.

1123
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:38,304
Rym: What was he gonna do?

1124
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,642
Rym: The word around the school was the last kid who crossed.

1125
00:59:41,702 --> 00:59:41,903
Rym: Burt.

1126
00:59:42,044 --> 00:59:45,470
Rym: Alvin was wearing concrete braces at the bottom of Bulmer Pond.

1127
00:59:46,391 --> 00:59:55,190
Rym: Tim was pretty good when it came to wrestling Hulk Hogan or Macho Man on his Nintendo trademark, but when it came to real life, he wasn't the kind of kid to fight much.

1128
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:59,950
Rym: Gosh, he really wasn't a kind of jam, and it wasn't the good grape kind either.

1129
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:04,049
Rym: "Excuse me," said a deep voice from behind him.

1130
01:00:04,291 --> 01:00:05,461
Rym: "Are you Timothy

1131
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:06,047
Rym: Bradley?".

1132
01:00:06,717 --> 01:00:07,249
Rym: Tim jumped.

1133
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,770
Rym: Startled, he looked up into the mirror.

1134
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:19,810
Rym: Standing behind him was a tall, blonde-haired man who looked like a superhero from a comic book, only with short hair and a vulnerable, perplexed look on his face.

1135
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:23,350
Rym: But boy, his costume sure wasn't from anything this century.

1136
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:30,370
Rym: He wore what looked like a handmade sheep's wool jacket and trousers with a sackcloth shirt cinched at the waist by a wide leather belt.

1137
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:35,870
Rym: His black boots were leather as well, and he smelled distinctly of garlic.

1138
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:37,428
Rym: "Uh, yeah, that's me.

1139
01:00:37,811 --> 01:00:38,722
Rym: What is this, Halloween

1140
01:00:38,762 --> 01:00:39,066
Rym: already?".

1141
01:00:39,835 --> 01:00:40,824
Rym: "May I introduce

1142
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:41,410
Rym: myself?".

1143
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,910
Rym: Tim noted a distinct accent.

1144
01:00:44,556 --> 01:00:46,050
Rym: "I am Simon Belmont.

1145
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:50,730
Rym: I have come here to your dimension to seek your help with a dreadfully important quest.

1146
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:52,430
Rym: The fate of Castlevania.

1147
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:58,348
Rym: To say nothing of my soul, my life, and the soul and life of the woman I love are at

1148
01:00:58,489 --> 01:00:58,790
Rym: stake.".

1149
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:02,305
Rym: "Oh," said Tim, "and I thought I had

1150
01:01:02,365 --> 01:01:02,889
Rym: problems.".
