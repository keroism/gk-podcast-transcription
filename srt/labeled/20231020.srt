1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,211
Rym: It's Thursday, October 19th, 2023.

2
00:00:13,211 --> 00:00:13,732
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:17,140
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:27,413
Rym: We've got the website up and then immediately couldn't do shows for like two weeks for literally No exaggeration unrelated reasons and now we're back.

5
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:29,099
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:32,406
Scott: So, uh, yeah, see if the.

7
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:32,828
Scott: we'll see.

8
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:34,914
Scott: we haven't uploaded an episode the news site yet.

9
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:36,700
Scott: Let's see if it even fucking works exactly.

10
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:47,251
Rym: I was actually about to open with so this episode might be up like way late because we can't get the website in order on YouTube because it's already on YouTube.

11
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:55,580
Rym: It'll appear on patreon Probably about 20 minutes after I eat dinner after the show and then it'll probably automate that eventually.

12
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:59,420
Rym: Yeah, we will but well, I want to wait cuz looks like patreon is making too much changes.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,439
Rym: So I don't waste our time implementing against their existing kind of.

14
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:04,435
Scott: yeah Change the whole bunch of shit going on.

15
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:07,595
Rym: Yeah The main reason I'm sticking with patreon right now.

16
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:10,123
Rym: Is that I'm Unless they go away.

17
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:14,215
Rym: It is a free publicly available archive of GeekNights.

18
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:20,180
Rym: regardless of if anyone donates money And that's the main we could go to archive that org also probably well where we should go everywhere.

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:30,895
Rym: but yeah, so that aside I was a biking home from work today like you do and it was Really windy when I got to that bridge.

20
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:40,880
Rym: like I like to bike in extreme weather and I don't mind wind and like Scott kind of makes fun of me for that like I will Bike in weather where Scott would absolutely not bike under any circumstances.

21
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:48,820
Rym: But even I had to pause my biking on the Queensborough bridge for fear of the wind blowing me into the side.

22
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:54,377
Scott: I've definitely had to stop biking at times in my life because I thought the wind would blow me away.

23
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:58,300
Scott: Yeah, and knock knock me over in a dangerous fashion.

24
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:12,263
Rym: and I was thinking about the wind and the name of the wind and I remember the Patrick Rothfuss existed and I went to see if that if there was ever a third book to that series that we read two of above the Kingkiller Chronicle, you know the Captain.

25
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:17,227
Rym: one of them you read - I read - and the second one was Definitely.

26
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:18,479
Scott: You said there were sex ninjas.

27
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:20,390
Rym: Now there were not.

28
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:30,784
Rym: there were sex ninjas, okay I remembered that correctly that and he accidentally out sexes the goddess of sex and she falls in love with him and That happens.

29
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:34,019
Rym: That's an odd one plus of the sex ninjas.

30
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:41,654
Rym: Okay, and those are the least noteworthy things that happen in that book that are worth making fun of.

31
00:02:41,674 --> 00:02:45,727
Rym: I But yeah, they're.

32
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:49,940
Rym: there still is no third book and there's no indication there ever will be a third book.

33
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:51,587
Rym: It seems like it's radio silence.

34
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:59,954
Rym: So it is a race between Patrick Rothfuss The Game of Thrones guy and our Scott backer to see whoever finishes what they started.

35
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:00,957
Scott: Does he have a D?

36
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:09,432
Scott: I mean, you know All right, I couldn't find like oh, I thought you're saying George RR Martin He also none of them are gonna finish these series.

37
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:10,958
Scott: a lot of our names in there.

38
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:17,560
Rym: Yeah I feel like you know, uh, jr Sold the mojo from all the other our people.

39
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:22,900
Scott: Yeah, the thing is I feel like you know, if our Martin actually finishes a book that'll get published no matter what.

40
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:32,138
Scott: Yeah But I don't there's no guarantee that like if backer or Rothfuss finish yet another book that some low backer is writing another book But it's not a prince of nothing book.

41
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:35,709
Scott: Okay, but I mean there's no guarantee that it'll be published.

42
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,872
Rym: I think it is.

43
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:37,955
Rym: I'm pretty based up from.

44
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:42,679
Rym: I'm pretty sure he is Under contract still for that third book.

45
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:46,953
Scott: Yeah What happens to authors when they sign like a five book deal and don't write?

46
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:48,438
Scott: they just stop and they don't make.

47
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,386
Scott: get the next Book, I don't know.

48
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:51,551
Rym: cuz the same thing happened.

49
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:53,440
Scott: I get back your advance or anything.

50
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,625
Scott: It's like you're the local.

51
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:58,805
Rym: every guy like signed up for what like six books and then that just went nowhere And he had a bunch of person.

52
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:03,326
Scott: I mean, I guess that the publisher has the option to stop early But it's like.

53
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:10,565
Scott: but if you if they want another one, they're like, hey We want another one and you don't cough up and you or you don't get it done What hat do you get in trouble?

54
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:14,276
Scott: Like I mean, I imagine anyone out there an expert on book deals I don't know.

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,148
Rym: I bet it depends a lot on the contract you signed and I bet But I'm saying it's like there's probably a standard.

56
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:23,137
Scott: the big publishers probably have a pretty standard set of terms.

57
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:31,905
Rym: Yeah Then I also I imagine those terms very primarily based on how wealthy successful and famous you already are as an author up to That point.

58
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:42,480
Scott: Yeah, I know that There's definitely a difference between Fantasy author who's writing a series deal and I'm a famous person writing a one-book thing.

59
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:49,105
Scott: you're gonna sell copies because I'm a separate famous person from Politics sports etc.

60
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:50,328
Scott: as showbiz.

61
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:53,096
Scott: Yeah, and I'm not even writing them most of the book.

62
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:54,800
Scott: Someone else is helping me, right?

63
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:03,359
Rym: I wonder if they get into publishers numbers get insurance Like I want insurance on this nerd who said he can write me 12 fantasy novels in case he doesn't make it past seven.

64
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:11,223
Rym: All right, so there's so much news that There's.

65
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,151
Rym: there's no way we can talk about all of it.

66
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:17,084
Scott: So much of it is gaming news tech news Political news.

67
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:22,520
Scott: like it's like there's like a hundred relevant nerd companies have laid people off Never mind.

68
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:28,860
Rym: There are like multiple earth-shattering breaking news's that happen between when we put up that website and stop doing GeekNights.

69
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:45,347
Rym: And now I'm not gonna talk about all of them But I think we're pointedly not going to address the ongoing Extremely rapidly escalating war in Israel partly because you should not be coming to a podcast by us To learn about that conflict.

70
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,040
Scott: No, I learned about it in school, which is you know where you should learn about it.

71
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:51,387
Scott: I will say this right.

72
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,814
Scott: Is that not about the war itself?

73
00:05:53,914 --> 00:06:02,967
Scott: Yeah, right, but about the the worldwide discourse right relating to the you know, the Israeli-palestinian conflict.

74
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,779
Scott: whenever it comes up not a healthy bring it again.

75
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:13,960
Scott: No, is that basically the situation is that you know you have in the air in the geographic area?

76
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:15,949
Scott: Right, you got Israelis.

77
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,938
Scott: Yeah, Palestinian people, right.

78
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:22,509
Scott: and In those right in each of those two groups, right?

79
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,240
Scott: There are violent people who kill innocent people.

80
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,812
Scott: Yeah, and there are the majority of each of those two groups are Normal people who just don't want to die.

81
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:34,380
Scott: They want to live their life and not die.

82
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,164
Rym: You know what just like everyone else people in Russia people in Ukraine everywhere Everywhere, right?

83
00:06:40,244 --> 00:06:49,151
Scott: And so what happens is you know, you end up with people Right who take sides in right.

84
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:49,873
Scott: it's like most.

85
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:58,697
Scott: a lot of wars, you know and a lot of our media We try to you know view everything is like try to identify good guys and bad guys right like with Russia.

86
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:02,239
Scott: It's like Ukraine Never attacked Russia, Russia.

87
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:07,050
Rym: Russia as a nation-state Clear aggressor clear bad guy.

88
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:12,000
Rym: Ukraine as a nation-states Clear defender clearly in the right in this conflict.

89
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:23,320
Rym: But a nation-state is not even necessarily the sum of its people like America is kind of a democracy But kinda there's a lot of discourse we could have there about how it's not a great one.

90
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:24,993
Rym: Germany is more of a democracy.

91
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:30,637
Rym: Russia is basically an entire nation-state at the behest of one angry guy full of grievances.

92
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:30,938
Rym: and the

93
00:07:30,958 --> 00:08:12,880
Scott: point is Right, you have these two sides both of which are simultaneously, right and perhaps close to equally evil heinous evil and Good, right and you know, depending on how you slice it up, right and People and you know look and see one evil or the other and take a side right and end up You know going some people, you know people go too far into the realms of either, you know anti-semitism or Islamophobia right and everything all this stuff because nobody can think subtly or You know with any level of even worse complexity beyond just two sides.

94
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,843
Rym: I am not defending politicians like but it is in science to recognize that Politicians.

95
00:08:18,904 --> 00:08:22,096
Rym: in many countries this conflict and democratic countries.

96
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:26,634
Rym: in democratic countries this conflict is not voting happens a geopolitical issue.

97
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:39,679
Rym: it also for really fucked up in bad reasons is a domestic issue and It is impossible to say anything even remotely nuanced and still get reelected in any context related to this.

98
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:52,340
Scott: Yeah, it's like even if you're a politician right who understands, you know the situation you've been briefed by experts And yeah, you know you you understand what's going on, right and have a complex nuanced opinion.

99
00:08:52,440 --> 00:09:07,246
Scott: If you go out and and try to say right that like hey This is two evil people fighting each other and killing good people on the other sides Right, and it's not just you know Some black and white kind of deal.

100
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:21,040
Scott: then one of those two groups or both Will just hate you now because you're either on their side or they're not they right And then they won't vote for you and then you lose your elected position perhaps to a crazy person.

101
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,308
Scott: Yeah, so you feel like it's better up.

102
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:37,528
Scott: a lot of politicians will actually just straight-up lie pretend or whatever and Look at their constituents and say what they have to say on the issue to get reelected Regard and hide what they truly believe.

103
00:09:37,548 --> 00:09:44,345
Rym: and that's not saying that's right You know, it's just take a line from that monkey video that I use Me.

104
00:09:44,365 --> 00:09:47,748
Scott: I would say what I believed and that I would be unelected.

105
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,768
Scott: but also You know Why should something anyone who's in like?

106
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:56,467
Scott: if you're the president of the United States what you have to say on this matter probably matters Especially

107
00:09:56,487 --> 00:10:02,831
Rym: because every word you say could Literally cause the conflict to get worse and more people to die, of

108
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:18,505
Scott: course, but if you're like the mayor of podunk Whatever city somewhere right not New York City That's like some whatever city and it's like your constituents are gonna vote on that issue when even though nothing you do in the position Has anything to do with it.

109
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:30,500
Rym: and it is very telling that in the United States the intent of Our two houses of our Congress not to get all into deep politics The intention was the house represents the people primarily on domestic issues and taxation.

110
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:35,075
Rym: the Senate represents the states and the Senate is what does treaties?

111
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:44,999
Rym: because the idea was experts in the Senate should be making geopolitical decisions and Domestic voters should not be directly interfering in foreign affairs.

112
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:46,245
Scott: Mm-hmm.

113
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:46,928
Scott: That was the.

114
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:50,644
Scott: that was the intent that we were taught in some studies class All of them.

115
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:53,332
Rym: all this political just we're not justifying.

116
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:57,666
Rym: but to use that line that I use a lot because it's a very useful Line from that monkey video.

117
00:10:58,148 --> 00:10:59,773
Rym: I'm not saying this is good.

118
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:02,000
Rym: I'm simply saying this is what happened.

119
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:11,880
Scott: Yeah, I think if you want to you know All I would tell the listener right is that if you're gonna open your mouth on this issue, right?

120
00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:15,040
Scott: I'm not imagining many of the listener because I wasn't.

121
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:22,770
Scott: We're alive as far back as the early 20th century nevermind 1947 when this core conflict began, right?

122
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:26,160
Scott: So you didn't see any of this happen, right?

123
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:34,687
Scott: So you should at least study read more than one book Perhaps even more than two books.

124
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:40,571
Rym: I'm gonna read I'm gonna link to because it's pretty well done and it's shorts Just in the news.

125
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:41,518
Rym: for any of you who?

126
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:45,200
Rym: Maybe think you want to say something about this out loud in public.

127
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:57,316
Rym: it is an old crash course video that is 12 minutes long that just explains the context of the region between 1947 and About eight years ago.

128
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:13,219
Scott: Yeah but regardless, you know if you You know can't tell the difference right between like the six-day war and the Yom Kippur War and which one happened first Between who yeah, right.

129
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,600
Scott: Then you should just not say anything about anything that's happening there because you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

130
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:26,940
Scott: Alright, and if you do really want to say something so bad well go Learn what happened there first, right?

131
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,860
Scott: Because it's one of the rare cases actually where I mean obviously history is connected to everything that's happening today, right?

132
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:48,245
Scott: Yeah, but this is one of those ones where it's still like, you know It's not one of those cases where like people are saying and sort of like, you know drawing connections like oh This is still the same Like continuous conflict about the same fundamental issues since 1947. ish, right?

133
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:48,987
Rym: It's it's right.

134
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:55,450
Scott: So it's still.

135
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:57,625
Scott: it's actually 3.

136
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,240
Rym: I think would be a better year to say that this all properly began.

137
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:05,313
Scott: I mean, you know, you could say it goes back thousands of years if you could.

138
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:09,685
Scott: only you know correctly Any of those old.

139
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,130
Scott: so they actually happened.

140
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:13,720
Rym: the one that this SciShow video gets to this.

141
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,164
Rym: it makes a very strong point that this conflict is not fundamentally about religion, which is a Facile at all.

142
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:22,340
Rym: thing that a lot of people believe has not much to do with it at all.

143
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:29,140
Rym: And the conflict as we know it today did really begin as a result of what happened in World War two.

144
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:35,139
Rym: So and the thousands of years like in the region are not it's a lot of it's the UK's.

145
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,625
Rym: for The UK like directly.

146
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:44,093
Rym: like you there are names of individual people we can blame and yet They have no responsibility for it now whatsoever.

147
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:45,920
Rym: Yep, and most of them are dead of old age.

148
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:52,074
Rym: Anyway in news that we can at least make fun of a little bit though.

149
00:13:52,094 --> 00:13:53,679
Rym: It is going to be a crisis soon.

150
00:13:55,224 --> 00:13:56,152
Rym: so last we left.

151
00:13:56,173 --> 00:14:07,647
Rym: the US House of Representatives had failed to elect a speaker in a historic ridiculous shit show and eventually elected a guy who sucked and That guy failed and one of the can.

152
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:12,220
Rym: one of the things he agreed to to even get the speakership in the first place.

153
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:14,730
Rym: Now bear in mind the speaker of the house.

154
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,460
Scott: It was that he could be kicked out easily.

155
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,185
Rym: He could be kicked out.

156
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:19,943
Rym: Basically it would one person He's like.

157
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:26,829
Scott: he's like vote for me and put me in the job And if I suck at it You can basically breathe on me and I'll leave.

158
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:32,300
Rym: any one person in the entire house Can immediately force a vote to kick him out and all they need is a majority.

159
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,706
Rym: That was the what he agreed to.

160
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:36,940
Scott: and guess what the Democrats went all that whole time without breathing.

161
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:39,425
Scott: They could have done it any one of them.

162
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:40,548
Scott: Yeah, none of them did.

163
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,759
Rym: the reason the Democrats didn't is that I mean politically tactically.

164
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:53,300
Rym: if The house is going to be broken It has to be the Republicans fault in a way that even a stupid person is not going to disagree with.

165
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:58,340
Rym: But to the Democrats couldn't elect a good speaker regardless.

166
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,951
Rym: They voted every time for Hakeem Jeffries.

167
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:01,895
Scott: They have not changed.

168
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:08,874
Rym: that which I like Would be a fantastic speaker of the house for everyone in America Republican and Democrat like.

169
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:09,917
Rym: he's just a good person.

170
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,179
Rym: best ever question Mark, uh, you know what?

171
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Rym: I think he might be the best ever and a big personal best and best in my living memory.

172
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,506
Rym: You know what a big part of that is?

173
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:18,109
Rym: He's not white.

174
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:25,340
Rym: the ones that the ones that I can remember I will take a name and name a non-white speaker of the house in all of American history?

175
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,199
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

176
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:39,679
Rym: But so, of course the dipshit caucus did this because the Republicans basically have such a thin majority That they have to vote a hundred percent to elect a new speaker or they can't.

177
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:44,999
Rym: they either have to give up and let the Democrats have the speakership or they have to all agree.

178
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:50,255
Rym: and There's between six and twenty people who political people are kind of legit.

179
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:53,069
Rym: it like this is a phrase I am seeing in a lot of places.

180
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:54,740
Rym: They're calling them the dipshit caucus.

181
00:15:55,403 --> 00:16:06,031
Rym: It's basically 20 or so dipshits who were elected from Extremely gerrymandered districts that go like 80% Republican So they are unaccountable to anyone like.

182
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:08,319
Rym: they will get reelected no matter what they do.

183
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:12,500
Rym: There can never be consequences for them unless they commit a crime and go to jail.

184
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:14,486
Rym: One of them might go to jail.

185
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:15,609
Rym: So stay tuned on that.

186
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,492
Rym: He's so bad.

187
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:18,759
Rym: Even the Republicans are talking about actually kicking him out.

188
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,633
Rym: They can't elect a speaker they like.

189
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,108
Rym: this is Literally never happened before.

190
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,680
Rym: this is the longest the house has ever been without a speaker.

191
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:35,564
Rym: they have been trying for two weeks to elect a speaker and it's just failing and failing and Failing.

192
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,620
Rym: and there are updates every day.

193
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,030
Rym: I can't even begin to summarize the ridiculous own goal.

194
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,033
Rym: shit show that is happening.

195
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:42,976
Rym: the American House right now.

196
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:51,493
Rym: the latest update Jim Jordan who by the way has one never passed a bill and two Directly, it's like it's like the worst person anytime you watch.

197
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,690
Scott: anytime you watch a congressional hearing And that guy's there.

198
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:55,960
Scott: It's like up mute button.

199
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,320
Scott: It's like it's like there are other Republicans not to say that they're good people, right?

200
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,640
Scott: But that you can listen to and they'll say something maybe possibly coherent.

201
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:06,643
Scott: Occasionally.

202
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:13,125
Rym: this would be like if one of the corrupt King this in the Lord of the Rings gave a speech and then God Oh this guy of a speed out.

203
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:18,240
Scott: Jim Jordan is like, you know the person you would ban from your forum after the first time.

204
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,228
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's like.

205
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:28,829
Scott: he's like the worst person Right, it's like, you know, just a terror like the internet troll Horrible conspiracy nut job awful human being.

206
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:34,509
Rym: he directly supported the January 6 coup attempt and he voted against Certifying the 2020 election.

207
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,179
Rym: So that tells you all you really need to know.

208
00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:40,650
Rym: He's the only candidate they've got to be speaker right now.

209
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,316
Rym: and even he can't get the votes.

210
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:45,809
Scott: and like 20 Republicans They have like hundred something members.

211
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:47,275
Scott: They can't just pick on any any.

212
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:48,320
Scott: none of them want to try.

213
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:52,134
Rym: No one who wants to try can get 100% of the votes necessary.

214
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:56,610
Rym: You need a majority of the house.

215
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:58,660
Rym: They only have a margin of like four.

216
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:05,320
Rym: So the dipshit caucus the smallest most dipshitty core of the dipshit caucus is six people.

217
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:06,919
Rym: That is more people.

218
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:17,799
Rym: Then you can have a defection one and still select a speaker unless the Democrats let you select a speaker and the Democrats are Saying we will only accept Hakeem Jeffries.

219
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:36,340
Rym: So this is an Unprecedented and I mean that literally crisis in American politics and it is noteworthy that right now America can't even pass bills to send aid to Israel or Palestine or Ukraine or anything like.

220
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:41,100
Rym: Not only is this an unprecedented crisis that has literally paralyzed the American government.

221
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:57,667
Rym: it's gonna shut down again in a few weeks if they don't pick a speaker and We can't do anything during an unrelated unprecedented set of multiple major wars starting simultaneously, so fun times in DC and the world.

222
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:01,990
Scott: I Wonder if you know you want to talk about conspiracy theories.

223
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:04,376
Scott: Let me make up some.

224
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:05,761
Scott: obviously not true.

225
00:19:05,781 --> 00:19:07,708
Scott: I don't want anyone spreading these.

226
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:10,999
Scott: I guess You know conspiracy theories that I just made up.

227
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,266
Scott: I literally just made up both of these ideas.

228
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:18,070
Scott: do not Pretend that I believe these or spread them as truth, right?

229
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:25,130
Scott: Conspiracy theory number one other countries do their bullshit with timing because they see this happening, right?

230
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:29,330
Scott: Even worse conspiracy theory to go even further.

231
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:38,315
Scott: Right that some people in the house are agents of the other countries making this happen on purpose to disable the US government And then the countries do those things.

232
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:41,745
Rym: what bothers me the most is that that's not a conspiracy.

233
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:50,530
Rym: some parts of that are Pretty well proven in that there are a number of members of the American House and Senate who are Republicans who?

234
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:58,110
Rym: Directly advocate for transforming American democracy into something more like Hungary or Russia and they say this out loud.

235
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:06,079
Scott: The point is if somebody is actually proven to be worked, you know That's I mean you're allowed to believe things like that, right?

236
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,404
Scott: That's not against the law, right?

237
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:16,909
Rym: But if anyone was shown You know A Democrat from New Jersey who if the Democrats are aggressively trying to force out of the Senate.

238
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:22,673
Rym: He's got about to be charged with being a foreign agent of Egypt like right now Right.

239
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:23,375
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

240
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:28,269
Scott: Is that if you're if you're clearly a foreign agent of another country of that nature, right?

241
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:31,817
Scott: But you know, we're not like at war with Egypt.

242
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:44,130
Rym: Yeah, in fact, actually it has been as a nation in this entire conflict Pretty reasonable and pragmatic relative to the history of that country in regard to this conflict.

243
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:53,337
Scott: that was a very guarded statement for a reason but sure but if somebody was an Agent of an evil place.

244
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,604
Scott: All right, we'd have real treason.

245
00:20:56,106 --> 00:21:02,390
Rym: Yep, but It's very hard to prosecute treason as we're seeing with the literal former president.

246
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:06,703
Scott: Well, that's you know, that's the the king's problem right?

247
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:08,930
Scott: is the stupid, you know the king who cried treason?

248
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,816
Scott: Yeah, I can 17 whatever.

249
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,762
Scott: it was just treasoning everybody in the UK.

250
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:17,724
Scott: It's like off with their head treason I don't you said but you don't like the color of my shoes.

251
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:18,690
Scott: treason head off.

252
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:26,490
Scott: So in 17, whatever right Ben Franklin was like, all right We can't let it be anyone be swinging around these treason so easily.

253
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:36,756
Scott: We got to make it real hard to do the treason because that fucking King over there He was just treasoning every fuck every to say I mean granted about half the states treason not too long later And we had the Civil War.

254
00:21:36,777 --> 00:21:43,029
Rym: so I'm just saying okay All right, one last little news before we get into everything else.

255
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:47,470
Rym: So I have to institute a rule that we haven't had to use on gig nights in a long time.

256
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:51,177
Rym: The Jack Thompson rule is back Weird after this news.

257
00:21:51,277 --> 00:22:03,670
Rym: We're no longer going to talk about Twitter in any context Unless the news about Twitter is somehow Bigger and crazier than any news that has ever happened up to this point about Twitter.

258
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:08,568
Rym: Because Twitter's dead like buried done nails so many nails in the coffin.

259
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:09,150
Rym: They can't even write.

260
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:13,263
Scott: It's like is Twitter literally out of business and closed and gone forever.

261
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:15,530
Scott: No, you can log in you can tweet.

262
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:17,122
Scott: Yeah, I can see tweets right?

263
00:22:17,222 --> 00:22:18,089
Scott: It's it's still there.

264
00:22:18,691 --> 00:22:25,453
Scott: It's actually you know, if you haven't been on it recently, which I hope you haven't it is more Like, you know.

265
00:22:25,534 --> 00:22:28,102
Scott: together then you might realize yeah, like.

266
00:22:28,523 --> 00:22:30,509
Scott: but you know, how many people are there that you follow?

267
00:22:31,773 --> 00:22:39,786
Scott: your timeline might be a little ghost town II but It's still there, but effectively it might as well just be turned off at this point.

268
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:41,190
Scott: Yeah, effectively speaking.

269
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:43,699
Scott: so it will talk about it again.

270
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:51,550
Scott: if like a it literally turns off or I don't know what it would have to be something of that nature for us to discuss it.

271
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:59,140
Rym: So if the theme of the last news in this news are is a punching yourself in the dick Twitter has put the final nail in their dick.

272
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,350
Rym: They are now going to charge money to tweet.

273
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:03,374
Scott: Well, I think they're.

274
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:05,160
Scott: you know, they're discussing doing it.

275
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,230
Rym: They rolled it out in New Zealand and the Philippines.

276
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:16,696
Scott: Yeah Now, you know, this is an idea that has been brought up for many Oh web platforms many times.

277
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:28,530
Rym: the idea of Retweet in the era before Twitter was completely ruined by everything else Probably would have solved a lot of Twitter's problems.

278
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:30,317
Scott: But it also right.

279
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:33,350
Scott: we also don't like this idea for many obvious problems, right?

280
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:41,656
Scott: It keeps out everybody who even if they have a dollar to spare right doesn't have a credit card to actually perform online transactions.

281
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:51,038
Scott: you'd have to sell like You'd have to sell gift cards in the store that are like one dollar and we see how healthy that ecosystem is with you GameStop and Nintendo points over the years.

282
00:23:51,419 --> 00:24:05,840
Rym: It also as you bring up there is a big difference between the ideological reality of paying for a service is superior if you pay with dollars Intentionally as opposed to paying with spying and advertising.

283
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:13,210
Rym: but the practical reality of having people pay with dollars Causes a lot of externalities that are hard to address under capitalism.

284
00:24:14,074 --> 00:24:20,797
Scott: Yeah, also when you have an audience that is entirely paying with dollars advertisers want to advertise to it more.

285
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:23,504
Scott: right because they know right it's.

286
00:24:23,604 --> 00:24:30,356
Scott: it's this weird thing that happens right where It's like, you know in the ad world We've talked about this so many times right?

287
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,950
Scott: all numbers in the ad world even before the internet are full of bullshit, right?

288
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:39,448
Scott: and that's sort of the standard for how it always bid right.

289
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:52,030
Scott: the You know radio ratings TV ratings, it's like no one ever counted those super precisely, you know Nielsen has methods that are not actually awful, but it's like they're imprecise, right?

290
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:56,342
Scott: They don't really know how many people watch the Super Bowl every year.

291
00:24:56,362 --> 00:25:02,853
Scott: Yeah, they just think it's a lot of people and they're not wrong, but Regardless.

292
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:07,950
Scott: and so what ends up happening is someone who's in a position of selling ads.

293
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:18,921
Scott: Every bot pretty much everybody almost everyone who sells ads Inflates the numbers to some degree right that like it'll be something as small as like.

294
00:25:19,262 --> 00:25:30,530
Scott: I have an email newsletter and I don't Subtract the people who unsubscribed until like, you know, some period of time has passed after they've unsubscribed.

295
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:33,710
Scott: That's like the smallest amount of number fudging, right?

296
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:38,608
Scott: But then so other people straight-up lie, like I'll round up to the nearest thousand right?

297
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:44,402
Scott: or you know, it's like They just count to get the biggest number they can.

298
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:53,598
Scott: and people who buy ads Right, sometimes don't even give a shit and they're just happy to believe lies And they don't really care about their ad performance.

299
00:25:53,999 --> 00:26:04,770
Scott: and some people who really are buying ads and do really care about performance Right Have trust want to get real numbers, but have a hard time doing so and we'll use various methods.

300
00:26:05,674 --> 00:26:08,830
Scott: But nothing even on the internet is is really accurate at all.

301
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:09,553
Scott: Now here's the thing.

302
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:16,618
Scott: if you go down this road that Twitter is going down of charging money Getting rid of bots, right?

303
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,950
Scott: You are going to bring the numbers down.

304
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,670
Scott: Yeah way way down.

305
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:29,135
Rym: But meanwhile the number of dollars coming in even if every human being who has ever used Twitter Paid a dollar a year.

306
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,970
Rym: That is not the amount of money the advertisers were paying Twitter.

307
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:40,307
Scott: nope So the dollars that come in are basically just blot blocking bot blocking.

308
00:26:40,528 --> 00:26:41,010
Scott: Those are not.

309
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:44,770
Scott: Those are not dollars that actually gonna be your good revenues, right?

310
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:54,224
Scott: It's like but you're hoping that advertisers would rather pay More money if they know that their ads are being seen only by real people.

311
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:56,329
Scott: but a smaller number, right?

312
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:01,149
Scott: Or would the advertisers rather pay for the big number?

313
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,500
Scott: But they're not all real people and the fact is right.

314
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:08,148
Scott: It was the same number of people either way.

315
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:09,499
Scott: Yep It's it right.

316
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:10,246
Scott: It's just right.

317
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:21,488
Scott: It's the same number of real humans are gonna see the ad either way whether you block the bots or not It's the same number of real humans that are there right.

318
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:23,593
Scott: So why right?

319
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:30,390
Scott: but yet you're gonna you know mess with the your advertisers perception by messing with your number, right?

320
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:32,153
Scott: So it's not.

321
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:43,005
Scott: this is why big platforms have never right taken the strongest measures To actually block all the bots and duplicate accounts and fake accounts.

322
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:48,189
Scott: because when you do that People see the reality which is that the number is small.

323
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:57,838
Scott: The number is small now if you are running on that many people that char really using these platforms really active on these platforms Right there never really have been.

324
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:00,247
Scott: the number has always been mega inflated.

325
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:03,329
Rym: now Meanwhile, look at a service you pay money for like Netflix.

326
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:11,466
Rym: They know how many people are paying money And all they really care about is how many people are paying money because that money goes directly to them.

327
00:28:11,908 --> 00:28:15,230
Rym: and then they figure out What is the minimum level of content and effort?

328
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:22,221
Rym: We need to put in to make sure the money that people pay us is Significantly more than the money we spent like that.

329
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:28,289
Rym: and they keep raising there and they're raising the prices again And they're probably right to do so because they kind of won the streaming war.

330
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:30,214
Scott: Maybe we'll see.

331
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:33,770
Rym: I mean all the other platforms are on the verge of bankruptcy like no one's doing well.

332
00:28:33,897 --> 00:28:44,187
Scott: Yeah So in the related tiniest news right Apple in the new iOS has updated the podcast app Which most people don't use I guess because people hate that app for some reason I didn't.

333
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:44,990
Scott: I never really needed it.

334
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:49,162
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why people hate it so much but it there's nothing wrong with it.

335
00:28:50,065 --> 00:28:53,051
Scott: They updated it a bunch whatever They.

336
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:56,822
Scott: I actually been using Spotify more because the people who complain about it.

337
00:28:57,584 --> 00:29:06,007
Rym: They use like they have like really fiddly particular Fussy things they want to do with podcasts that I just don't understand.

338
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:06,650
Rym: like they're like.

339
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,507
Scott: I just want the newest episodes to be there so I can listen to.

340
00:29:09,527 --> 00:29:14,330
Rym: they're like no But I want to be able to set a rule where it keeps the most the most recent five episodes of these shows.

341
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,432
Rym: But I want to keep the whole archive of this other show and I want like they have all these fiddly Requirements.

342
00:29:18,472 --> 00:29:19,656
Rym: like I don't care.

343
00:29:19,736 --> 00:29:21,723
Scott: I just listen to episodes and they come out otherwise.

344
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:23,769
Scott: I'm not listening to it, so I don't want it anyway.

345
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:28,261
Scott: The D it used to be that the Apple podcast app.

346
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:31,350
Scott: Apple is no longer the number one podcast client anyway.

347
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:33,223
Scott: they're like number three or four or something.

348
00:29:33,263 --> 00:29:38,830
Scott: but the Apple podcast app used to just keep downloading all the episodes.

349
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,170
Scott: So if you subscribe to GeekNights in that app it would just download every GeekNights episode, right?

350
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:50,384
Rym: Even if you weren't listening to GeekNights Scribes far more popular than it actually is.

351
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:58,050
Scott: just like there's a lot of people If you're looking at downloads as if you're looking at downloads of mp3s as your metric because obviously you can't track plays.

352
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:00,358
Scott: You don't know if someone's playing it or not.

353
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,442
Scott: They might play it ten times.

354
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:08,002
Scott: you might right, but if you're looking at downloads Numbers were inflated and now the newest iOS doesn't do that.

355
00:30:08,062 --> 00:30:12,337
Scott: if you don't listen to that podcast it stops automatically Downloading all the episodes.

356
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,790
Rym: so that's I think this is great.

357
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:16,688
Scott: Yeah I don't think that's good, too.

358
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:23,751
Scott: But it's a similar story to Twitter where the number you can show the advertisers is going to be smaller Right.

359
00:30:24,232 --> 00:30:28,658
Scott: and so even though the true number of listeners is unchanged.

360
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:41,610
Scott: Yeah unchanged our Advertisers going to pay less money because it's harder to lie to them with a bigger number Even though their true number was the same before as it is now if it was worth it to them before.

361
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:47,846
Scott: Nothing is different now other than the person who is lying to you can is forced to lie less.

362
00:30:48,227 --> 00:30:55,918
Rym: Well, especially because the downloads Represent someone actually listening for real.

363
00:30:55,938 --> 00:31:11,190
Rym: so you have this hard number, but the podcasters there are a lot of people I get the impression who are fans of podcasts and They throw a subscribe over there because they're asked to by the person they're a fan of because that helps the advertiser metrics.

364
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:16,490
Rym: So you can support a podcaster you like by being a subscriber because it juices their metrics a little bit even if you never listen.

365
00:31:17,073 --> 00:31:26,388
Rym: I think there's a lot of people who subscribe to things on YouTube on all these platforms Because they're trying to do a solid for the person they like but they don't actually engage with that person's content.

366
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:32,089
Rym: Mmm, I think that's a thing and you know what we're about to find out how much of a thing that is.

367
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,038
Scott: Well, you know, we'll see.

368
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:36,388
Scott: anyway, that's that's just going back.

369
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:40,242
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

370
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:41,770
Rym: so full disclosure.

371
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:45,117
Rym: This video does have a sponsored ad in it.

372
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:48,624
Rym: I'm just gonna tell you straight up It's it's actually pretty cool software.

373
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:50,629
Rym: I think so I don't feel that bad about it.

374
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,410
Rym: But also it's on a channel that does a very very good content normally.

375
00:31:55,972 --> 00:31:58,602
Rym: So I'm okay linking to this because the video.

376
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:00,610
Rym: you're not familiar with how music works.

377
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:04,207
Rym: You know about minor scales and major scales I'm sure most people at least know.

378
00:32:04,248 --> 00:32:11,290
Rym: like Minor scale music sounds a little bit sadder and darker and major scale music sounds happier If you know a little more about music.

379
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:21,547
Rym: you know about the modes like the Lydian mode and the mix of Lydian mode and the Phrygian mode and different kinds of minor scales and songs are written in all sorts of complicated scales.

380
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:26,026
Rym: this Video takes a song that you might have heard of.

381
00:32:26,187 --> 00:32:26,590
Rym: it's called.

382
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:45,703
Rym: It's called Bohemian Rhapsody by an artist known as Queen and they play a snippet from the song and then they Alter the song to be very well done in a bunch of different Musical modes as an exercise in showing you how different

383
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:47,790
Scott: song already has like four or five modes.

384
00:32:48,059 --> 00:33:00,033
Rym: Yeah But it takes basically just killed a man like that little bit and plays just that bit in a bunch of nine different Distinctive modes and it's very well done It.

385
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:05,829
Rym: if you ever wondered like how these different scales work This is a really good demonstration of it.

386
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:12,657
Rym: If you heard about harmonic minor and melodic minor and wondered why there's all these different minor scales well, yeah, there's a reason.

387
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:23,849
Rym: one of these sounds way better than the others for a reason and what I'll leave on is a lot of people talk about how the locrian mode is Impossible nonsense garbage that should never be used for any purpose.

388
00:33:24,492 --> 00:33:29,370
Rym: The locrian mode would be if you're sitting at a piano you start at C and you play all the way up to the top.

389
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:30,548
Rym: It makes a nice major scale.

390
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:41,626
Rym: Move your fingers one white key to the left Start on B and play whatever scale that is B to B. It's gonna sound like shit.

391
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,970
Rym: That's the locrian mode.

392
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:53,810
Rym: You're gonna find out what Bohemian Rhapsody would sound like if someone earnestly tried to make the locrian mode work For this song at the end of the video.

393
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:56,602
Scott: So, what do you got?

394
00:33:56,623 --> 00:34:01,610
Scott: so I mean, I guess I could have saved a speedrun thing of the day for a Tuesday, but whatever.

395
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:06,185
Rym: So I thought you're gonna open with a joke about how we finally discovered nuclear fusion.

396
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:12,150
Scott: Well, no, it's So on a Monday, there's a Game Boy Advance Castlevania game.

397
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,330
Scott: There's a few of them, but there's one called circle of the moon, which I've never actually played.

398
00:34:15,571 --> 00:34:17,580
Rym: I kind of want to know I never beat any of those.

399
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,589
Scott: I've tried anyway, they're good.

400
00:34:20,612 --> 00:34:25,750
Scott: But anyway speedrunners play those games obviously and you know speedrunning.

401
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:28,748
Scott: I think I still enjoy it as a spectator of it.

402
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,161
Scott: But lately it's like you haven't really seen.

403
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:46,963
Scott: you know, you see people beating times Right, but you're not seeing too many incredible techniques developed and known games like in big games people have sort of pushed things to the limit yeah and this to the point where they have things like the Simpsons people putting out a

404
00:34:51,137 --> 00:34:57,083
Rym: One where humans have achieved Within like a couple of frames of Taz near Taz.

405
00:34:57,123 --> 00:34:58,770
Rym: perfection like yeah.

406
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:07,130
Scott: But you know in terms of like something a new development that dramatically changes something in an entertaining for the spectator fashion is rare.

407
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,777
Scott: But here we obviously have a case of that.

408
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,002
Scott: Otherwise, it wouldn't be mentioning it.

409
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:14,123
Scott: So the circle of the moon They discovered a technique called nuclear.

410
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:15,270
Scott: They call it nuclear fusion.

411
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:21,649
Scott: It's a good name is the bit the greatest thing ever when you activate this trick and you don't fuck it up.

412
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:28,590
Scott: Basically, it does Maximum infinite damage to every enemy as soon as the enemies appear on screen.

413
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:40,443
Scott: So you like walk into a boss room boss dies As soon as like enemies die before they get on screen you barely even get to see the nine nine nine nine nine nine that appears That's it's just nine nine nine nine nine covering the screen.

414
00:35:41,248 --> 00:35:46,883
Scott: Yeah And it's really fun and awesome and she completely changes how people speedrun this game.

415
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:54,116
Scott: obviously that to make separate categories Yeah with and without this glitch, but it's super fun to see it And I really wish I had.

416
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:59,976
Scott: there's a lot of games that I wish I had that and I Mean games a lot of game.

417
00:36:00,137 --> 00:36:10,005
Scott: There are a lot of games that are that are fun games Except they have really shitty fighting and I would love to just auto win all battles Eliminate the combat from the game and have an otherwise good.

418
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:10,105
Scott: so

419
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:22,070
Rym: when I was a kid I played bionic commando once with a game genie because I'd never beaten it before like this when I was pretty young and I put in the code that made you invincible And I got all the way to the game and it was super fun.

420
00:36:22,572 --> 00:36:26,674
Rym: And then I got to the bit where you got to shoot Hitler and if you fall you get shot by that gun and you Have to try again.

421
00:36:26,695 --> 00:36:30,614
Rym: and I missed because it's actually a hard shot Especially if you're a kid.

422
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:39,530
Rym: and then I fell and the gun didn't kill me because I was invincible Invincible and I softlocked the whole run was ruined and it was over and I was fucked.

423
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:46,627
Scott: But I'm gonna say, you know playing doom with IDD QD and IDK FA is not unfun.

424
00:36:46,727 --> 00:36:47,690
Rym: It is definitely fun.

425
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:49,596
Rym: I've I've done that a couple.

426
00:36:49,636 --> 00:36:50,018
Rym: I do.

427
00:36:50,098 --> 00:36:50,580
Scott: I'm not good.

428
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,586
Scott: You know, it's not obviously not you know, impressive Yeah, but it can be fun.

429
00:36:55,747 --> 00:37:05,250
Scott: I mean I Still even though your can't die and there's no skill involved in fighting the monsters You still have the fun of finding secrets and exploring mazes?

430
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:09,866
Scott: And just shooting monsters is can be enjoyable even if there's no risk.

431
00:37:09,906 --> 00:37:11,010
Scott: it's only reward, right?

432
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,564
Scott: It's like it's like buying a bag of candy and eating it.

433
00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:14,570
Scott: No risk all reward.

434
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,761
Scott: It's like there's still enjoyment to be had because it's entertainment software.

435
00:37:19,242 --> 00:37:21,467
Scott: Yeah, but you won't see me playing doom that way very often.

436
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:26,200
Rym: Yeah You know thinking about playing doom 2 again With IDD QD.

437
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:38,130
Rym: Yeah, just kind of straight up Just actually I have beat doom to a couple times in high school on hurt me planning And that's the best I ever did and that was that took a lot of attempts on some of those later levels.

438
00:37:38,652 --> 00:37:39,134
Scott: I just don't.

439
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:42,869
Scott: it's shocking even today how few of the secrets I know where they are.

440
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:50,358
Rym: It's like I know where they are in doom - because I was obsessed with that game and modded it'll pass the early levels Like I have no fucking clue I find I don't.

441
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:58,350
Rym: I spent more time in wadded and Dehacked fucking with doom and like digging into how maps were set up than I ever did playing the game.

442
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:06,650
Rym: Yeah, anyway anyway in the meta moment I'm gonna skip the normal meta because one we've already gone on for like 45 minutes and two.

443
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:10,221
Rym: The most important meta is the new GeekNights website is live.

444
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:12,930
Scott: Yeah, we don't need to talk about it every meta moment anymore.

445
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:13,975
Rym: Yeah, it's live.

446
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:14,999
Rym: It's up.

447
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,843
Rym: We're gonna in.

448
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:17,330
Scott: it seems to be functioning.

449
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,600
Scott: We nobody's said that like hey, we can't get your podcast anymore.

450
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:23,770
Rym: We've had aesthetic and UX complaints, but that's expected.

451
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:32,790
Rym: We just wanted to get it live because you know What sucks more than making a website better making a legacy website better simultaneous to making a new website.

452
00:38:33,551 --> 00:38:37,830
Scott: Right, you know, I didn't wait until the new website was perfect before putting it up, right?

453
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:46,576
Scott: I said hey as soon as the new website is as good as or even slightly better than the old website I'm gonna put it up Even if there's still more work to be done.

454
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:51,148
Scott: because a I did a whole bunch of work making it really easy to work on the new website.

455
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:56,369
Scott: So I or anyone else because it's now just open on github.

456
00:38:56,409 --> 00:39:02,590
Scott: there If you send pull requests and they get merged they are automatically and instantly deployed to the new website.

457
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:06,863
Scott: No, no effort required which is awesome and makes it easy.

458
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:09,270
Scott: Like I said easy to work on and improve.

459
00:39:09,992 --> 00:39:16,494
Scott: So it's just a matter of finding time identifying what to fix and fixing it adding new features Whatever.

460
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:25,197
Scott: if you have ideas for features Send them in as github issues or make a pull request or you know, yeah I'm still gonna be working on it.

461
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,387
Rym: any ideas anything throw them at us.

462
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:32,309
Rym: worst case We just don't do it because it's hard or we don't like it like you got nothing to lose.

463
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:36,579
Scott: You could take the code and make your own website if you want.

464
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:42,898
Scott: Yeah, that's similar, you know podcast II features, I guess and We're gonna keep evolving from there.

465
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:47,150
Rym: The the biggest thing is that It was literally unrelated reasons.

466
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:58,764
Rym: It was a combination of like I got sick with a minor cold and then we had some like life fun stuff that we went to Do like events and then there was a hockey game and our schedules just like it was a perfect storm.

467
00:39:58,784 --> 00:39:59,305
Scott: It's like 15 20 minutes.

468
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:08,963
Rym: Yeah There that's why I'm not gonna try to upload the episode until after dinner because I want to eat and at least be able to watch This hockey game, but we'll get it uploaded.

469
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,534
Rym: So but I guess Totally unrelated.

470
00:40:11,594 --> 00:40:17,120
Rym: it is literally the only reason we have not used this website for a new episode Solely because of life nonsense.

471
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,709
Rym: tonight just happen to be a good night to do a show.

472
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,643
Scott: so We'll see if the technology for that part functions or not.

473
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:24,687
Scott: and be a sting

474
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:44,995
Rym: this episode That you might be watching on YouTube because you're wondering why it's not on our website Or you might be listening to it on patreon because you're wondering why it's not on our website if this episode is not up tonight Do Give us some time because that means that we got to fix something and I'm not gonna stay up late to fix something Together with.

475
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:47,266
Scott: I'll just do it tomorrow's Friday and I got a whole weekend.

476
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:48,050
Scott: It's gonna rain again.

477
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,576
Rym: So yeah, this weekend's fucked anyway, so it's not like I can go hiking.

478
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:59,650
Rym: So yeah, if the episode does not get up tonight Blame the fact that this is our first production test of uploading an episode of fully.

479
00:41:00,853 --> 00:41:11,559
Scott: I did test it many times on production But well, you also haven't tested with now Rym's uploading episode and I haven't tested actually uploading to lips And I uploaded to fake FTP places.

480
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,849
Scott: Yeah, so lips in is obviously weird.

481
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:19,150
Rym: Yeah, so there might be a kink or two and the episode might not appear right away.

482
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:24,835
Rym: But then we got a long rainy weekend until next week when we do a show on our normal schedule again And then we're back to normal.

483
00:41:25,177 --> 00:41:27,350
Rym: So this episode is kind of just a test.

484
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:42,381
Rym: We were gonna do a hello world test last week like a short episode But then I got sick and the worst thing was I wasn't like too sick to do stuff, but the sickness involved Sneezing constantly like to the point that I couldn't record anything like.

485
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:45,190
Rym: it was super gross and really annoying.

486
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:50,740
Rym: You know, I think it was the most annoying sickness I've ever had in my life.

487
00:41:50,861 --> 00:41:54,190
Rym: that's sneezing like I cannot express how irritating it is.

488
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:55,084
Rym: Do you just sneeze?

489
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:58,669
Rym: Several times a minute and not be able to stop?

490
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:03,030
Scott: Alright, so let's talk about some of the I guess the features on this new website, right?

491
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:06,501
Scott: So we have a. the search function is way better.

492
00:42:06,661 --> 00:42:09,230
Scott: Like it's using a postgres text-based search.

493
00:42:09,795 --> 00:42:11,269
Scott: It should be lightning fast.

494
00:42:12,293 --> 00:42:17,690
Rym: I just searched for Jack Thompson and it says search results page 101 for Jack Thompson and didn't have anything.

495
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:19,322
Scott: I have four results.

496
00:42:19,402 --> 00:42:20,410
Rym: Oh, I spelled his name wrong.

497
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:21,894
Scott: There you go.

498
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:23,481
Scott: Oh, but that is a bug.

499
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,390
Scott: It should say no results found or something.

500
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,457
Rym: Yeah, it says page 101.

501
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:27,201
Rym: So there's nothing.

502
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:27,745
Rym: so there we go.

503
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:29,920
Scott: I can put it All right, so I can put something.

504
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:36,062
Rym: get up if you if you don't yeah, a Geek fable a myriad of topics a Stratego.

505
00:42:36,082 --> 00:42:43,170
Scott: Yeah, there is a Player built into the website that uses the standard HTML audio tag.

506
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:46,925
Scott: So that's you know, we don't have any weird player tracking you or anything.

507
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:48,090
Scott: We don't even have Google Analytics.

508
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:49,823
Scott: I have no idea who's visiting this website.

509
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:54,890
Scott: We've removed all If you know, I guess I removed it actually what quite a while ago from the old website.

510
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:59,299
Scott: But there is no tracking or any Nonsense of any kind on this website.

511
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,785
Rym: Yep, the player just works.

512
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:01,970
Rym: It just works on mobile.

513
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:03,719
Rym: It just works in weird browsers like.

514
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:05,850
Scott: it's just HTML audio thing.

515
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:13,249
Scott: You know, we have we updated the various links on the website so they go to the right places.

516
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:17,315
Scott: That's you know, there's.

517
00:43:17,355 --> 00:43:19,582
Scott: there isn't a bunch of garbage left over I don't know.

518
00:43:19,943 --> 00:43:21,910
Scott: it's a website with links to podcast episodes.

519
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:27,724
Scott: Yeah, like the podcast the main yeah, the main feature is that it produces an RSS feed.

520
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:35,250
Scott: then the RSS feed is Like as every possible RSS thing that you can have for a podcast.

521
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:44,260
Scott: it's like I looked at like the RSS feeds of like the top podcast like NPR podcast shit like that and We're doing everything that they're not doing.

522
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:51,329
Scott: Yeah, if Rym actually bothers to enter it Like we even have like chapter data in there We gotta start doing like I.

523
00:43:51,369 --> 00:44:04,950
Rym: so It was a nice confluence that I made a pipeline to crank out thumbnails for videos Because of Adobe Express which is actually like it works pretty well like it kind of just works.

524
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,922
Scott: Yeah, you can put images on the episodes now.

525
00:44:08,525 --> 00:44:09,650
Rym: So I'm gonna start you.

526
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:15,309
Rym: I'm gonna leverage these capabilities with increasing fervor as time goes on as we ramp this up.

527
00:44:16,132 --> 00:44:19,100
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, why does the website actually exist?

528
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:26,530
Scott: it exists mostly to produce an RSS feed right and So that if people search they can find us, right?

529
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:32,070
Scott: Yeah, they can find our pot and and you know just so that you know, we don't want to be beholden to various platforms.

530
00:44:32,271 --> 00:44:34,544
Scott: It's like we can have our own place.

531
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:39,736
Scott: That's why it exists and You know, it serves that function.

532
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:45,010
Scott: I imagine most listeners don't need the website don't have a use for it, right?

533
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:47,714
Scott: You know, it's.

534
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:47,995
Scott: it's.

535
00:44:48,236 --> 00:44:52,330
Scott: they're just using their podcast app or YouTube or whatever it is that they're using.

536
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:53,979
Scott: Yeah, and that's perfectly fine.

537
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:55,930
Scott: I don't care if you use the website or not, right?

538
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,629
Scott: I I have it because we have to have one not be.

539
00:44:59,493 --> 00:45:03,930
Scott: But the search function I hope is actually, you know, the most useful thing.

540
00:45:04,111 --> 00:45:12,689
Scott: so if there's like a old GeekNights you're looking for or you know you You want to know if we ever talked about a particular thing?

541
00:45:13,432 --> 00:45:20,557
Scott: You can go and use that search function and it should be faster and hopefully more helpful than like doing a Google site search or something like yeah,

542
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:30,570
Rym: and we do have one feature that we have to bring back later around related content and we'll talk about that if and when we have a better implementation

543
00:45:31,571 --> 00:45:32,614
Scott: The one that.

544
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:37,047
Scott: well, there's actually a few things that are already on the list to do right.

545
00:45:37,489 --> 00:45:42,390
Scott: one thing Is that you know to make it so that when we post episodes they automatically get shared.

546
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:43,814
Scott: You know all around right?

547
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:45,059
Scott: we talked about the posse model.

548
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,630
Scott: publish on your own site syndicate everywhere elsewhere.

549
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:50,590
Scott: We have to do a lot more syndicate elsewhere, right?

550
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,094
Scott: so I can right.

551
00:45:52,134 --> 00:46:08,310
Scott: so I've already done the thing to where if you like post a link to our one of our Episodes say on discord or somewhere like that you'll get or our forum you'll get sort of the automatic Fancy embedded thing right with like the logo and all that stuff appearing.

552
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:15,710
Scott: But I have to make it so that when Rym uploads an episode it automatically posts on discord without us having to do that by hand.

553
00:46:15,813 --> 00:46:17,274
Scott: Yeah Automatically.

554
00:46:17,314 --> 00:46:19,610
Scott: make a post on patreon without us having to do it by hand.

555
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,312
Rym: I'm a big fan.

556
00:46:20,332 --> 00:46:33,490
Rym: we were talking about privately among some friends the why not just syndicate on every fucking possible thing Anywhere like why not have up a pop three that just will email you a podcast like it Point outlook at GeekNights and you'll get your pot.

557
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:40,974
Scott: We could gather email addresses and set up a thing to where people subscribe to eat nights by email and it emails everybody when there's a new.

558
00:46:40,994 --> 00:46:46,137
Scott: you know Yeah, I.

559
00:46:46,197 --> 00:46:49,603
Rym: so I was poking around on the search and I found a gem already.

560
00:46:49,743 --> 00:47:10,089
Rym: I found something we uploaded on July 30th 2012. it was me appearing on episode 57 of Friday night party line and in the forum There is video of the live stream of the podcast and all the people on it And the video is also embedded in the website because of how good Scott is at his job.

561
00:47:11,592 --> 00:47:14,850
Rym: It looks like we talked about the possible discovery of the Higgs boson.

562
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:20,370
Rym: So there's been a lot of movement since that episode and I think I see Timo was on this episode.

563
00:47:20,772 --> 00:47:21,375
