1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,238
Scott: It's Thursday August 30th.

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,222
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:15,815
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,350
Scott: how to not suck at making youtubes?

5
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:25,397
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:32,290
Rym: Yeah, so I'm taking tomorrow off at work.

7
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:42,371
Scott: Yeah, my co-workers taken tomorrow and Tuesday off I think I'm going to be going to work and not doing so much there because we sort of Cleared up all the work to be done.

8
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:48,156
Scott: You know for the bait for the Three-day weekend, and we didn't make any new work to do.

9
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:48,316
Scott: well up.

10
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:50,987
Rym: Why not just not go in?

11
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:54,200
Scott: because I need those days for other times.

12
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,298
Rym: But we could be playing natural selection all day.

13
00:00:57,318 --> 00:01:01,952
Scott: tomorrow We'll be playing natural selection a whole lot on Sunday and Monday.

14
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:02,614
Scott: Do not fear.

15
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:12,140
Rym: Yeah, it's probably good because if you were here We'd just be playing but I'm at least gonna spend some time Installing that Nick that'll actually work in Linux and then fixing my computer so I can easily boot into Windows.

16
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:19,997
Scott: Yeah, sounds like a good idea because right now Sort of not so good over in your department, but it's really great in my department.

17
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:22,991
Rym: well the issue I've got let's see you don't have to boot into Linux anymore.

18
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:23,594
Scott: I do.

19
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:24,719
Scott: I do quite often.

20
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,328
Scott: That's where all my music and my movies and stuff are.

21
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,736
Scott: oh yeah, and my all my files.

22
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:34,512
Scott: Oh well Yeah, it's just kind of hot and I'm kind of tired.

23
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:36,399
Rym: and what do you have to be tired about I?

24
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,927
Scott: Don't know just am.

25
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:45,020
Scott: maybe it's that article I read that was like hey Don't use technology before you go to bed so much, or you'll be all tired.

26
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:46,926
Rym: Actually, I read an article like that.

27
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:50,157
Rym: I think three or four years ago when I've been trying to do that.

28
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:54,620
Scott: since then yeah I've been trying to read before I go to sleep instead of technology and emailing.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,146
Scott: But the problem is I've done it all this week.

30
00:01:57,267 --> 00:02:07,352
Scott: actually the problem is I end up reading for way long And you do that thing where you just keep reading and reading and then eventually I keep reading Hold my eyes open anymore.

31
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:12,077
Rym: you ever get that point where you think back And you realize that you didn't actually read like the last ten pages.

32
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:12,620
Rym: you've just been fun.

33
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:15,440
Rym: I hate that so much, and then you're trying to flip back like man.

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,344
Rym: How far did I go?

35
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:18,191
Scott: what I have been doing though is I've been reading.

36
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:19,155
Scott: I'll talk.

37
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:20,260
Scott: I'll just get right into it.

38
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,822
Scott: I'm gonna do.

39
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:21,726
Scott: I got no news.

40
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,630
Scott: I'm gonna do a geek back.

41
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:23,876
Rym: You mean a geek bite?

42
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:27,070
Rym: all right geek bite Way to fuck up the new thing.

43
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,862
Scott: yeah doing a geek bite on these books I'm reading.

44
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:34,600
Scott: so I'm actually been doing a thing with these books where I haven't been using a bookmark or anything.

45
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:42,100
Scott: So whenever I have to stop and start reading again I end up like skimming through like the most recent chapters until I find the spot where I left off.

46
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:45,420
Rym: You know I've always done that and I really think it's the best way to read books.

47
00:02:45,560 --> 00:03:00,040
Scott: Yeah, I think it's actually a really great way because then if I just start where the bookmark is I might forget something important And I've remembered a lot of things because of this and it doesn't really take me that long To get back into the book after I've you know stop reading and pick it up again.

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,340
Scott: And also I mean I've read almost two of these books within like five days.

49
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:06,787
Scott: Let me talk about the book.

50
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:17,289
Scott: so Rym knows and some of my friends know I am NOT a fan of novels that have you know labels on them professing that they are part of some Licensed property.

51
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:18,979
Rym: so none of those forgotten realm.

52
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:23,893
Rym: yeah mech warrior Star Trek Star Trek Battletech.

53
00:03:24,135 --> 00:03:30,776
Scott: none of these none of these books Really interest me because I say wow that person couldn't come up with an original story.

54
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:36,735
Scott: They just Took this world and put another story in it so they could milk off the people who were.

55
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:40,451
Scott: you know like Star Trek fans Will buy the book no matter what even if the book sucks.

56
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:41,857
Scott: There's no reason to read these.

57
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:52,424
Scott: and one licensed property that has novels is of course Star Wars which I am more a fan of than any of the other licensed properties which Have novels in the sci-fi section.

58
00:03:52,504 --> 00:04:10,159
Scott: and while obviously I think many Star Wars novels are fan fiction basically and many people agree Everyone has always professed that the Timothy's on yes on Like Admiral Thrawn series of books is not bad and in fact the best.

59
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:17,394
Scott: now I said well if I read the best I'll know that all the other ones are worse than that and I'll be able to judge from there.

60
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:20,680
Rym: now what I can say because A lot of you might not know about Admiral Thrawn.

61
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:35,734
Rym: I didn't know about him until one of the best games ever made came out a game called tie fighter Such a simple name and in Thai remember, that's a game that got a 97 in PC gamers definitely one of the top 10 games ever.

62
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:39,005
Rym: the only game to beat it in Any reasonable span of time.

63
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:41,673
Scott: was the PC CD-ROM release of tie fighter?

64
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:44,000
Rym: Yes, which got a 98 because it was slightly better.

65
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:47,235
Rym: Yep, but in that game there was.

66
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:55,040
Rym: you saw in the opening movie Which the movie is kind of lame by today's standards, but back then in that era of computing that opening movie was fucking amazing.

67
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:57,531
Scott: It was pretty good and it talked it talk.

68
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:58,736
Scott: Maybe you could watch it on YouTube.

69
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,500
Scott: We should try to find a link.

70
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:00,520
Rym: Yeah, I'll try to find one.

71
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:07,900
Rym: But anyway, you get to see a big scary-looking blue guy and his is Admiral Thrawn and you don't know much about it.

72
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:08,883
Scott: And Admiral throw.

73
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:11,451
Rym: other than that you get the impression that he kicks.

74
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:12,595
Rym: and actually back then.

75
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:14,080
Rym: No, he was only vice Admiral Thrawn.

76
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:21,913
Rym: Oh, I believe Darth Vader says signal vice Admiral Thrawn to have our our Thai squadrons launch immediately Uh-huh or something to that effect.

77
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:29,040
Scott: Yeah anyway From reading these books I can tell that the the Star Wars outside of the six official movies.

78
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:36,420
Scott: Continuity is totally crazy and all over the place and not so contiguous between video games and books and things.

79
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:38,526
Scott: But it's self consistent within.

80
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:44,446
Scott: I guess if you just like read watch the six movies and then read these three books It's pretty contiguous.

81
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:51,409
Scott: I mean the first three movies like episodes 1 2 3 not Perfectly contiguous, but it's pretty close.

82
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,820
Scott: You can you can bend the rules and get away with it.

83
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,523
Rym: It's one of those.

84
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:55,648
Rym: don't worry about it.

85
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,291
Rym: Just go with it.

86
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:56,913
Rym: kind of things.

87
00:05:57,014 --> 00:06:00,105
Scott: Yeah, I mean these are written I guess in the early 90s.

88
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:04,700
Scott: So after Return of the Jedi and before the crap fest phantom, whatever.

89
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:10,828
Scott: so anyway, I'm reading them and Everyone says they're the best Star Wars books.

90
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:14,160
Scott: and well I could say they're better than fanfiction.

91
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:21,038
Scott: So knowing that the rest are fanfiction that I guess everyone agrees that these are the best because they are now.

92
00:06:21,078 --> 00:06:25,271
Scott: they're not like Literary masterpieces of all time or anything.

93
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,140
Scott: Don't go don't go fooling yourself about that.

94
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:52,559
Scott: but if you like Star Wars Star Wars universe and you like Horatio Hornblower books or the lensman books or you know a novel with not so much deep meaning or symbolism but you know a story of People are all badasses Trying to beat each other out with lots of twists and turns and details and tricks and things like that.

95
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:54,825
Scott: It's not.

96
00:06:55,047 --> 00:07:02,375
Scott: it's worth your time to read it because like I said, I've read One and three quarters of these three books in like a week.

97
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:08,258
Scott: So it doesn't take very long It's it's a quick read and I'll probably go buy the third one because I got to finish the second one.

98
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,627
Scott: real soon I'll go buy the third one.

99
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,460
Scott: It's like the Barnes & Noble tomorrow or something.

100
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:17,680
Scott: And then I'll probably be done with Star Wars books forever and that'll be the end probably done with Star Wars forever.

101
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:26,110
Rym: Oh, yeah, pretty much except I could watch those original three movies over and over, you know I kind of want to watch return of the Jedi right now.

102
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:29,200
Scott: I kind of want to watch return of the Jedi right now also.

103
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:33,027
Rym: Yeah, maybe this weekend not tonight.

104
00:07:33,308 --> 00:07:34,933
Scott: We got to get some DVDs or something.

105
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:39,269
Rym: So speaking of Star Wars This one's kind of complicated.

106
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,220
Rym: I got a news here and you're gonna have to bear with me.

107
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:42,587
Scott: Actually Star Wars related.

108
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:42,949
Rym: Yes.

109
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:43,633
Scott: Holy crap.

110
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:46,862
Rym: You just watched it Right.

111
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:51,501
Rym: So I'm gonna explain this because it's you got to just bear with me and at the end you'll see where I'm going with This.

112
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:55,459
Rym: so a guy ran for school board in some town.

113
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,960
Scott: Awesome school board is awesome to run for and he made a little commercial.

114
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:07,264
Rym: That was basically he is a Jedi and he's going to with his lightsaber Save the day in the school and it was a you know Cheesy but yet

115
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:11,481
Scott: that definitely get all the nerds at the school to vote for him all the 18 year old nerds Anyway,

116
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:13,026
Rym: plus what little we learned about

117
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,030
Scott: him all the nerdy parents

118
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,297
Rym: his stances on various educational issues.

119
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,280
Rym: I would have voted for him.

120
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:17,942
Scott: Yeah, he said.

121
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:21,492
Scott: he said that he is displeased with the leave.

122
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:22,776
Scott: no child behind act.

123
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:24,100
Rym: it displeases him.

124
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,642
Rym: I see.

125
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:29,240
Scott: I see he will open up some sort of Jedi Academy to train the students with the force.

126
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,826
Rym: I figured he just choked death.

127
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:31,870
Rym: anyone who opposed him.

128
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:32,633
Scott: Haha.

129
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:34,220
Scott: I don't know what color was his lightsaber.

130
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:37,193
Scott: Did he shoot me lightning from his fingers or not?

131
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:38,440
Rym: It was kind of white.

132
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:45,580
Rym: Oh, well, but anyway, so he made this video and then he put the video up on the youtubes.

133
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:47,524
Scott: He's an awesome person.

134
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:55,331
Scott: anyone who's awesome enough to run for school board with a Star Wars commercial also Guaranteed to be awesome enough to put that video on YouTube.

135
00:08:55,512 --> 00:09:03,160
Rym: So then not too long ago Someone took this commercial and aired it on TV with some humorous commentary of their own.

136
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:21,319
Scott: This someone was vh1, you know, I've noticed there's a lot of you know, professional and I don't know how to say professional but like mainstream big like big-time media that's scooping up a lot of our you know, homegrown content and using it for their own purposes.

137
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,869
Scott: and Sometimes that's okay.

138
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,257
Scott: And sometimes it's not.

139
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:32,460
Rym: well Usually it's not because a lot of times these companies don't actually understand or agree to the Creative Commons license.

140
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:35,660
Scott: Well, I don't know did the guy put it up under Creative Commons license?

141
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:42,180
Rym: He might have just put it up in general Yeah, but in this specific one regardless you could say pretty clearly that it was fair use.

142
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:52,380
Rym: But yet maybe not because on one hand they broke it down and while they aired the whole thing It was pretty short and they kind of humorously like how did I how did I how did I on their show about that?

143
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,808
Scott: Is a vague thing.

144
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:55,437
Scott: I didn't think it could be fair use.

145
00:09:55,478 --> 00:09:55,880
Scott: That's right.

146
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:05,212
Rym: Well, the argument is it is fair use for everything except the fact that vh1 and this whole thing is purely Commercial and was purely making money and it.

147
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:06,900
Rym: the argument could go either way.

148
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,377
Scott: So I'm not gonna need a judge to decide that sort of thing.

149
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:14,900
Rym: Yep So the guy says wow vh1 made some commentary on my thing.

150
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:21,940
Rym: So he takes the vh1 video with the commentary of his Star Wars video and puts it on YouTube.

151
00:10:23,704 --> 00:10:30,718
Rym: vh1 then Sends a takedown notice to YouTube saying that he is violating via comments vh1, don't they?

152
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:30,999
Scott: Yes.

153
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:38,460
Rym: Yes The biggest YouTube opponents that he is violating his own copyright and therefore the video must be taken down.

154
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,520
Scott: That's a vague thing there.

155
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:53,989
Scott: I mean if someone take we a GeekNights We have a share alike license Which means that if you were to remix GeekNights that then you would have to put it under a license Which is you know pretty close to the license we you give you.

156
00:10:54,371 --> 00:11:02,977
Scott: so there's no way that you could remix GeekNights And then we couldn't legally take that remix and use it ourselves for our own purposes.

157
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:03,760
Rym: Yes a lot of people.

158
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,980
Rym: This is a kind of viral clause in the license we use and there are other open source licenses that are viral in there.

159
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:19,160
Scott: That's the reason we chose to put the share alike there because while it sort of restricts us in that You know some people who would have otherwise, well, no, it doesn't restrict us at all.

160
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:22,879
Rym: No, if anyone wants to use it for something else, all they have to do is ask us.

161
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:28,295
Scott: But the thing is it does hold people back who don't want to ask from using our stuff.

162
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:31,493
Rym: who good if someone won't put Forth that tiny bit of initiative.

163
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:38,020
Scott: I don't care about them I know but it does decrease the exposure theoretically, I guess or the potential exposure anyway.

164
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:43,920
Scott: But if anyone ever does anything with our stuff, we can always go and use it our own way.

165
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,184
Scott: Yeah, it's basically the.

166
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:48,574
Rym: if you fuck up we get whatever you use GeekNights in.

167
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:48,976
Scott: Yep.

168
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:53,380
Scott: So this guy I don't know what license he used but let's assume he just did nothing.

169
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:55,760
Scott: So we have this vague.

170
00:11:56,201 --> 00:12:07,831
Scott: They might have infringed on his copyright to create something new and then he definitely Infringed on their copyright by taking that something new back now And it's it's pretty sketchy going on.

171
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:10,000
Rym: the rabbit hole goes a little bit deeper.

172
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,650
Rym: Oh, man, and this is the part that I just found out.

173
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,119
Rym: so he posted that back on YouTube, right?

174
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:18,860
Rym: But he only posted it on YouTube because he uses that as a video host.

175
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,307
Rym: He can't put videos on his blog.

176
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:21,593
Rym: his blog won't stand up to that.

177
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:22,900
Rym: in his blog.

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,780
Rym: He embedded it and then he had commentary on the vh1 commentary.

179
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,440
Rym: So that would be fair use.

180
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:34,640
Rym: However, it's the whole work which puts it into a slightly gray area.

181
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,091
Rym: But to know why did he modify the actual work?

182
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:40,680
Scott: or was the commentary next to the work in the blog?

183
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:41,925
Rym: That doesn't matter.

184
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:43,092
Scott: Oh, it doesn't know.

185
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:43,896
Scott: I figured it would.

186
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:49,279
Rym: no You can take a picture like a fair use picture and put it in an article talking about the picture.

187
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,985
Rym: So and there's argument of it.

188
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,089
Rym: well, he took the whole work.

189
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,520
Rym: so yeah, but and the weird part is alright.

190
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,780
Rym: now We have this technological problem where he used a host in order to put it somewhere else.

191
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:08,060
Rym: So alright say I have the commentary to something I'm fair-using on my blog and I just put it on my web hosting not even YouTube.

192
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:13,000
Rym: What if someone else just links to the bare file that I'm embedding in my thing?

193
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:14,036
Rym: Are they now?

194
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,302
Rym: Violating?

195
00:13:15,322 --> 00:13:16,145
Rym: what's the violation?

196
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:18,113
Rym: at what point does it not become fair use?

197
00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:19,780
Rym: and the problem with our?

198
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:29,340
Rym: Copyright system is that unless you have a lawyer and a judge to tell you there's no way to know and in the end Whoever has a lawyer and money just wins because I can't fight against those people.

199
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,068
Rym: Well, I guess I can because we have a lawyer here.

200
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:33,713
Rym: But yeah, most other people can't.

201
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:47,120
Scott: it's just more examples of how broken The copyright system is and you know things are gonna happen every day Just like this that further expose all the faults in the system and I'm just waiting for it to finally fall apart completely.

202
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:49,631
Scott: I don't know how long it's gonna take but I've been waiting at least.

203
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,620
Scott: oh, it's five six years.

204
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:56,046
Rym: It just bothers me because if you look at it from a purely Years, I have.

205
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:59,080
Rym: I think that the way this would have should be legally.

206
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:07,860
Rym: I don't care how it's written But the end result should be that vh1 could use it because he posted it freely But then he can use the one because they took it from him in the first place.

207
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:09,284
Scott: Yeah, that's what I would say.

208
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:14,721
Scott: We should be okay because I'm all for the you know, more information spreading action It's.

209
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:15,725
Scott: it's all cool by me.

210
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:25,335
Scott: The problem I'm seeing though that that's that's more important here is Originally in the Napster days right before people like us were creating content.

211
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:31,660
Scott: It was just us Infringing on the copyrights of the big companies who created stuff to get stuff, right?

212
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,240
Rym: Yep, and they would just sue or send down take-down notices just all the way because they were always right.

213
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,805
Rym: It was always the Britney Spears song.

214
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:39,712
Rym: It was never like I made something else.

215
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:51,348
Scott: But now that people are making stuff we've got the big companies that we were stealing from before stealing back from us and The law while on paper.

216
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,029
Scott: we're in the right and they're stealing from us the same way that you know They say is wrong.

217
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,219
Scott: It's sort of like one of those.

218
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:03,077
Scott: Yeah We the law only is for the big people to protect against the little people not the other way around.

219
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:08,060
Scott: sort of like how Free trade means that the importer exporters don't have to pay tariffs.

220
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,933
Scott: But I still can't get a DVD from Japan at a reasonable price.

221
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,160
Rym: I hear he's an importer exporter.

222
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:16,360
Rym: What's the import chips?

223
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,000
Rym: What's the export diapers?

224
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,547
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

225
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,918
Scott: I'm just getting tired of all this bullshit.

226
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:38,257
Scott: and We have the Creative Commons thing and I have decided to Basically strictly adhere to it in all cases unless I give specific permission.

227
00:15:38,297 --> 00:15:41,608
Rym: Otherwise, yes And very few people have actually been given permission.

228
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:42,290
Scott: So I have.

229
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,479
Scott: so if anyone tries to violate our Creative Commons license I am gonna come after you just because I have nothing better to do.

230
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,029
Scott: Yeah, all I may not have mad moneys for a lawyer.

231
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:53,820
Scott: I have a little bit of moneys for a lawyer.

232
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,219
Rym: Well, also we have a lawyer.

233
00:15:55,634 --> 00:16:02,565
Scott: Yeah And I got nothing better to do and I really want to come after you so that my show will become popular and I'll get All-over slash dot and dig.

234
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:04,152
Scott: Yeah, so bring it on.

235
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:06,000
Rym: so I don't have permission to bring it on.

236
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,640
Scott: I welcome you to violate my Creative Commons license.

237
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,065
Scott: Actually, I don't.

238
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:13,402
Scott: I don't want to say that because that means that you know I'm allowing you to.

239
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,549
Scott: I'm not allowing you to violate it.

240
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,736
Scott: I'm daring you to violate it.

241
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,137
Scott: up.

242
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:28,147
Scott: to be more precise I dare you things of the day.

243
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,409
Rym: So a while ago.

244
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,210
Rym: I did a thing of the day about Rowan Atkinson.

245
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,179
Rym: I think it was a fatal beating or something.

246
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:34,585
Scott: A lot of people say I look like him.

247
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:40,455
Rym: you kind of do Yeah, but uh way back I kept saying oh But there's this other thing.

248
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:45,053
Rym: Rowan Atkinson live like all the different bits in it and the best bit Was the one.

249
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,665
Rym: well other than the surreptitious wink was the one at the end.

250
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:51,346
Scott: I Tell you you did a pretty good surreptitious wink.

251
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:58,646
Rym: I must say But the bit at the end kind of the climax of his live show was the invisible drum kit.

252
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:01,115
Rym: and back when I wanted to Talk about it on this show.

253
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:03,022
Rym: I couldn't find a link to it anywhere.

254
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:04,750
Rym: I couldn't find a video that was hosted of it.

255
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:06,012
Rym: I found it.

256
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:06,655
Rym: Here it is.

257
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,400
Scott: It's on dig videos today.

258
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:08,761
Rym: Yep.

259
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:10,224
Rym: So enjoy.

260
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:12,069
Rym: This is quite amazing.

261
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:13,490
Scott: It's a pretty good bit.

262
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,553
Scott: I wonder how he does it.

263
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:19,990
Scott: does he do it with like practicing a routine that is time to record it audio or is there?

264
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,963
Scott: Someone backstage making the audio live, you know in sync it.

265
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:34,308
Scott: he could have done it a number of ways and Depending on which way he did it It's the skill and practice required maybe more or less impressive and I'd like to know I

266
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:38,310
Rym: Get the same enjoyment out of this that I do out of watching like a pen and teller act.

267
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,780
Rym: Yeah, definitely cuz it's not the oh my god.

268
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,525
Rym: He did a magic trick.

269
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,230
Rym: It's how the fuck did he do that?

270
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,290
Scott: Well, it's it's yeah, I don't know what you want.

271
00:17:47,390 --> 00:18:02,429
Scott: all right, my thing of the day is a bunch of pictures from Cuba a place that is hard to see if you don't live there because Crappy old grumpy old people in the US government don't want to just forget about this bullshit from like 50 years ago.

272
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:08,459
Rym: The fact that Cuba is still Embargoed by the United States is just ludicrous.

273
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,341
Scott: What say the?

274
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:12,230
Scott: what's supposed to be the point of still having it embargoed?

275
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:19,825
Scott: I mean, I understand Embargoing it back then I might have done the same thing I mean, but eventually you're just like why are we still doing this back then?

276
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,070
Rym: There was a Soviet Union.

277
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,953
Rym: There was a fear of communist dominoes and all that nuclear missiles Yep.

278
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:31,950
Rym: Yeah, but there's no longer any fear of the Soviets coming over into Cuba.

279
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:33,575
Scott: Yeah, not so much.

280
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:39,819
Rym: So granted there is the kind of pink revolution going on in South America right now that Cuba may or may Not become a part of.

281
00:18:39,981 --> 00:18:40,930
Rym: but that's beside the progress.

282
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:44,270
Scott: I learned a few things from looking at these pictures and from the captions on them.

283
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,221
Scott: First of all, I learned that some parts of Cuba.

284
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,310
Scott: There's a lot of really nice stuff, which I knew.

285
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:50,713
Scott: Some parts.

286
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:52,059
Scott: there's some not so nice stuff.

287
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:57,990
Scott: I also knew that I learned that people in Cuba's They can't get parts for their cars because embargo.

288
00:18:58,612 --> 00:19:04,253
Scott: So they're the best mechanics in the world and they all fix their cars without replacement parts.

289
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:15,236
Scott: and there's all sorts of pictures of people with really old cars like able to keep them running without any replacement parts whatsoever like they make their own parts and supposedly the best mechanics in the world.

290
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:20,370
Scott: and I sort of want to Undo the embargo just so I can get new mechanics over here.

291
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:27,166
Rym: Yeah, that's where we need them the power of necessity like way back when we did that Gallery of interesting tools that prisoners.

292
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:36,590
Rym: Yes Yep If you got if you got no tools and no stuff and you need something and all you've got is time You're gonna come up with a pretty clever way to get that thing done eventually.

293
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:38,749
Scott: Yeah, especially if you're stuck on the road needed to move.

294
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:43,710
Scott: There's some pretty funny anti-bush propaganda that I can sort of read.

295
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:52,082
Scott: There's a lot of abandoned like big fancy buildings that never weren't completed or abandoned or fixed You know with cinder blocks in the windows.

296
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:53,370
Rym: There's a lot of that in Russia.

297
00:19:53,972 --> 00:20:17,946
Scott: I've come to find that I you know, I've read about North Korea and Russia and China and it seems like in all the actually communist countries there seems to be this common trend of start an ambitious construction project that seems to be going well and then Scheduling delays or just complete failure to finish the thing all together like that giant hotel in North Korea that's never finished and they stopped working on it.

298
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:22,384
Scott: and Russia there's all sorts of stuff like that and it's like what.

299
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,630
Scott: why does this happen?

300
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,288
Scott: I mean I could think of a whole bunch of reasons why in a communist nation this thing would happen.

301
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:33,766
Rym: the reason Communist nations have that problem is the same reason token ring is not used today.

302
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:42,890
Rym: Oh Real simply token ring and Ethernet were kind of competing with each other to be the way that people would do networking with computers.

303
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:48,081
Rym: Communism and capitalism were the two economy ideas that were competing with each other.

304
00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:51,510
Rym: What are we gonna use capitalism or communism now token ring?

305
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,402
Rym: Essentially the way it worked is that everything was deterministic and controlled.

306
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
Rym: There was no randomness.

307
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:58,790
Rym: There was no chance for error.

308
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,761
Rym: It was the token goes around.

309
00:21:01,123 --> 00:21:02,390
Rym: every computer has to be smart.

310
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:04,774
Rym: every piece of networking equipment has to be smart.

311
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:07,560
Rym: every piece of the way everything has to be controlled.

312
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:22,225
Rym: a hundred percent and as a 16-megabits per second you got no matter what the full 4 or 16 megabits per second Because you knew exactly what was happening on the network at all times.

313
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:24,814
Rym: It was all controlled In Ethernet.

314
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:29,609
Rym: you pretty much threw packets out there and you let the network just deal with it.

315
00:21:30,252 --> 00:21:36,443
Rym: And as a result while Ethernet was 10 megabits per second You would often only get four or five at best.

316
00:21:36,524 --> 00:21:40,849
Rym: just because you're not controlling it You kind of let it work itself out on its own.

317
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:53,709
Rym: But as the scale of networks increased you couldn't make token ring go much faster than 16 megabits per second because you had to control it at every step of the way and The token ring bureaucracy got too big.

318
00:21:54,772 --> 00:22:01,170
Scott: But with but with Ethernet, I know I understand that it's you know The comp the the complications of the bureaucracy and stuff that bog it down.

319
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:08,070
Scott: But I'm wondering specifically like is it that they build a building and then they mess up and they can't finish it because of engineering?

320
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,823
Scott: Is it because the workers don't want to work anymore?

321
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:12,470
Scott: is that they can't afford to work on it anymore?

322
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,676
Scott: Is it you know what?

323
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:16,510
Rym: I think it's mostly just the poor allocation of resources.

324
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:25,670
Rym: I mean not to say that capitalism is perfect if they run out of materials But in capitalism at least the system tends to correct gross deficiencies or gross problems.

325
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:36,770
Rym: Like if there's a super discrepancy between the demand for steel and the production of steel a bunch of people are gonna start making Steel on their own because they can make some money and then the market kind of corrects itself.

326
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,979
Rym: And again, it's not perfect.

327
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,229
Rym: But at least it kind of works itself out.

328
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:55,030
Scott: Yeah well the only other picture I want to draw your attention to is this one of a pretty cute girl working at an ice cream stand and Apparently ice cream is two and a half Cuban cents if you're a Cuban or a dollar if you're from anywhere else.

329
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:56,237
Rym: You know, I'm fine with that.

330
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:58,170
Scott: Yeah, but it's a lot of stuff.

331
00:22:58,491 --> 00:23:12,415
Scott: It's one of those places where they have really nice things and some not so nice things and apparently tourists I guess not tourists but anyone from elsewhere in the world who's not Cuban gets all sorts of nice things and Cubans don't get those nice things.

332
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:16,246
Scott: This acts like museums here that Cubans can't even go to and stuff.

333
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:25,679
Rym: Well, the one thing is I communism on a very small scale seems like it can work and Cuba was very small and generally prosperous.

334
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,374
Rym: and it does kind of bother me that I do believe that if we had After the Cold War it ended.

335
00:23:30,394 --> 00:23:41,290
Rym: if we just embargoed Cuba and not just kind of completely dick them at every possible opportunity I don't think it would have been the greatest place in the world But I think it would be doing a lot better than it is now.

336
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:44,426
Scott: I think you would be a happy place to go on vacation is what I think.

337
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:50,230
Rym: I just think America even to this day is kind of afraid of a communist country being prosperous.

338
00:23:51,112 --> 00:23:54,230
Scott: I think this is a bunch of old people still in charge of the government.

339
00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:01,228
Rym: I mean, we can't pretend that China is communist, but that that's Cuba is mostly actually communist from what I'm led to believe.

340
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:07,290
Scott: Yep It's so communist that the people don't care about repairing their houses because the houses belong to the state not to them.

341
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:07,847
Scott: What do they care?

342
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:09,412
Rym: Right.

343
00:24:09,512 --> 00:24:11,949
Rym: So, uh, we're kind of tired and it's hot out.

344
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:20,850
Rym: So we're gonna do a how to not suck which I haven't done in a while and we're gonna have to break it Internally into two bits because there are two very different sets of rules depending on what you're doing.

345
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:29,845
Rym: But tonight it is very simply and very briefly and very succinctly how to not suck at Making a YouTube video.

346
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:35,077
Scott: now I could sum this whole thing up in like two sentences and we can go to bed But I want to break it up now.

347
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:35,902
Scott: I do want to break it up.

348
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:37,230
Scott: But let me just say the two sentences.

349
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:43,701
Scott: people have short attention spans and They want instant gratification now.

350
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,530
Scott: Keep it in mind before we continue.

351
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:46,132
Rym: Word.

352
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:46,513
Rym: I'm not.

353
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:53,135
Rym: we're not gonna talk about an art film or a short film or anything like that those things those works of art.

354
00:24:53,476 --> 00:25:00,762
Rym: you do whatever you want because YouTube is just the medium and you don't really you shouldn't let the medium to Dictate what your content is going to be.

355
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:02,510
Rym: if you're gonna make a short film just make it however you want.

356
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:08,470
Rym: We're talking about the YouTube videos, which is the majority of them that consist of oh my god.

357
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:11,023
Rym: Here's a video of something that just happened in the street.

358
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:14,242
Rym: or oh my god Here's a video of the prank me and my friends pulled out.

359
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:15,450
Rym: or check it out.

360
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,524
Rym: Here's the video of me blowing up my high school.

361
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:19,994
Scott: Oh Like check it out.

362
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:22,363
Scott: I made this, you know cool thing out of Legos.

363
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:24,430
Scott: or you know, check it out.

364
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:28,448
Scott: Here's some crazy thing that I saw in the news or you know, something like that.

365
00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:37,449
Rym: so I think the biggest mistake that people make when they're making a standard YouTube video is That they like to have a lot of exposition.

366
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,650
Scott: Basically when you make it, let's say let's use an example video you ready?

367
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:44,998
Scott: Oh my god, there's a crab person in my backyard.

368
00:25:45,018 --> 00:25:53,370
Scott: Alright, well don't sit there for like a minute telling me Alright, so I went to the store and when I came home I looked out the back window and I saw this crab person.

369
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:54,721
Scott: No your video.

370
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:59,350
Scott: as soon as I click play I want to see your camera pointing out the back window and I want to see a crab person.

371
00:25:59,632 --> 00:26:00,499
Scott: That's what I want to see.

372
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:01,869
Scott: I'm not I don't have time.

373
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:05,261
Scott: I have a short attention span remember and I want instant gratification.

374
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:07,267
Scott: crab person and only the crab person.

375
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:08,130
Scott: shut your trap now.

376
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:14,550
Rym: I'm okay with a short introduction Especially if it's going to be a strange thing or a scene that you're really gonna need some prior knowledge to parse.

377
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,065
Rym: Yeah, sometimes exposition is needed like in a how-to video or even in that I'd be okay.

378
00:26:19,105 --> 00:26:19,968
Rym: Here's a good and bad.

379
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:22,939
Rym: good There's a crab person outside.

380
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,310
Rym: cut crab person bad.

381
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,034
Rym: so I came home from work on Friday.

382
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,818
Rym: music starts playing as in in the video.

383
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:34,590
Rym: music starts playing and I saw something crazy.

384
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,089
Scott: And then and and and and and and and and and sorry I couldn't help myself.

385
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:50,642
Rym: All right number two Unless you have a good reason to and you're sure that is going to work.

386
00:26:50,703 --> 00:26:53,710
Rym: Well, don't put music in your video.

387
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:57,705
Scott: Yes, for example, I have a video of Rym setting himself on fire.

388
00:26:58,086 --> 00:26:59,130
Scott: Should I set it to music?

389
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,512
Scott: No You know why?

390
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:09,030
Rym: because the people watching something like that are sick bastards and they want to hear Rym scream or in the very least They want to hear me go, all right, I'm totally going to set myself on fire.

391
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:14,232
Scott: Oh, oh, oh, and they want to hear the fire like, you know, crackling as it burns his pants.

392
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:17,329
Rym: And maybe they want to hear Scout with the camera going dumbass.

393
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,235
Rym: Yeah, but they what they don't want to hear is that's exactly right.

394
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:36,440
Scott: A good time to put music to something is when perhaps the audio of the video itself is, you know, not going to bring any entertainment value whatsoever.

395
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:46,620
Scott: Or like, for example, I don't know, you're flying in an airplane and you see something funny outside the window or something like that, like you see lying in an airplane.

396
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,700
Scott: The only noise you're going to hear is jet engine, jet engine, jet engine.

397
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,704
Scott: No one wants to listen to.

398
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:56,639
Rym: So if you're in an airplane and someone like tries to eat a hundred eggs, just film that as it goes.

399
00:27:57,261 --> 00:28:08,840
Rym: But if you're flying in an airplane and you see outside the window, a biplane covered in clowns, just that is perfectly appropriate to that.

400
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,758
Scott: Exactly.

401
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:11,102
Rym: All right.

402
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:18,720
Rym: Now, number three, if you're going to make music in your thing at all, one, make it appropriate to make it not stupid.

403
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:19,999
Rym: I know that's the same as one.

404
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:27,789
Rym: Three, don't use poison or or winger.

405
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:28,597
Scott: All right.

406
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,241
Scott: All right.

407
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:29,502
Scott: All right.

408
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:34,943
Scott: Another thing you want to do in YouTube videos is if you're going to have audio.

409
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:38,618
Scott: that's not music, you want to make sure people can fucking hear it.

410
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:43,540
Scott: because, I mean, how many times you put a YouTube video on it, someone saying something you can't hear what the fuck they're saying.

411
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:45,720
Scott: It's like a podcast.

412
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:46,705
Scott: It's even more important.

413
00:28:46,745 --> 00:28:48,514
Scott: But in a YouTube video, if what?

414
00:28:48,615 --> 00:28:54,243
Scott: if someone's saying something and part of the importance and the entertainment value of the video is what are they saying?

415
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:56,940
Scott: I should be able to hear it if I can't hear it.

416
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,603
Scott: What's the point?

417
00:28:57,623 --> 00:29:00,620
Scott: The video is ruined now if it's inconsequential.

418
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:08,200
Rym: It's just kind of side banter or whatever, and it's unintelligible, replace it with music or something seriously or just make it silent.

419
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,859
Rym: It's OK to have a silent YouTube video.

420
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,920
Scott: Yeah, no reason that there has to be noise.

421
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,760
Scott: I mean, how many times do you watch a funny guy robs a convenience store video?

422
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,464
Scott: There's no audio on those things because they have the cheapest, shittiest security camera they can possibly get.

423
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:24,724
Scott: And, you know, it's just as good as the ones where the video and the audio are full on.

424
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:33,520
Rym: Now, if your your event, not the exposition, but the thing you're filming itself is a very long build up to a climax.

425
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,180
Rym: You don't really want to have the entire build up and then the climax.

426
00:29:39,023 --> 00:29:41,400
Scott: You must learn to make the montage.

427
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:50,404
Rym: Now, this is the one case where you probably should have music because otherwise it might sound really disjointed.

428
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,777
Rym: But say you've got a video of I don't know, I got.

429
00:29:53,817 --> 00:29:54,460
Scott: I got an example.

430
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,500
Scott: Let's say you got a video of a prank that involves one hundred people.

431
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:57,841
Scott: Right.

432
00:29:58,243 --> 00:29:59,850
Scott: But there's a lot of.

433
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,220
Scott: it takes you time to collect the hundred people.

434
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:19,717
Scott: Well, instead of showing like a 10 minutes of footage as all these hundred people start to gather around and someone explains to everyone exactly what's going to happen in like five seconds of video, you can show like a stop motion of like 10 photographs of, you know, the group is five people, 10 people, 50 people, 100 people.

435
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:20,522
Scott: Right.

436
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:22,838
Scott: And just go like did it did it did it did it.

437
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,560
Scott: And we'll see the group go from small to big and the matter of like five to 10 seconds.

438
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,639
Scott: And that's all I need to see.

439
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,720
Scott: OK, a group formed that you got the information across.

440
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,768
Scott: You basically want to get all.

441
00:30:35,828 --> 00:30:39,202
Scott: you don't want to cut any information or entertainment out of your video.

442
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:45,640
Scott: You just want to cut time out of the video because, like I said, short attention span is the gratification.

443
00:30:46,101 --> 00:30:56,404
Scott: You want to get all the content of your video, everything that people want to see in it into as small a time as possible without removing any of the good stuff you want to eat minus Jeff.

444
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,440
Rym: If you want a good example of this, check out watch a show like Mythbusters.

445
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,780
Rym: Notice how they kind of fast forward through and show just quick clips while they like.

446
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,799
Rym: they show a bunch of clips of all the setup for a thing.

447
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:11,903
Rym: And while they're showing that, they do the exposition at the same time with an audio over.

448
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:17,679
Scott: That way you get the exposition and you don't have to sit there for like an hour while they're building things in the shop.

449
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,324
Rym: But that way also you get the exposition and at the same time you're getting all the setup video.

450
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:23,939
Rym: You're killing two birds with one stone.

451
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,887
Scott: Another thing, how many people?

452
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:36,699
Scott: when they're making videos of stuff, especially, you know, sort of really amateur videos, you have this incredibly shaky camera that is always pointing in the wrong place.

453
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,059
Rym: The shaky cam is bad.

454
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:45,279
Rym: If you can't keep your hand still, don't put it on YouTube or at least get a steady cam thing or a tripod or something along those same lines.

455
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:55,642
Rym: If you don't know how to use a camera, don't film stuff and put it on YouTube, because a lot of people like they just keep zooming in and out or they keep like moving the camera around.

456
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:57,339
Rym: like, look at this, look at this, look at this, look at this.

457
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:07,760
Scott: I don't know how many times I've watched YouTube where there was something interesting happening that I wanted to see, but the camera didn't capture it because the person using the camera sucked balls.

458
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:20,560
Scott: And thus I knew an awesome thing happened off camera or perhaps I could see it, but not very well because the camera was shaking all over the place and I just didn't get the enjoyment that I would have gotten if the camera was used properly.

459
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:36,380
Rym: Now, if due to the limitations of the size of a file you can put on YouTube, you have to choose between extra exposition or extra setup or showing me the denouement, the payoff, the end result, the aftermath, we'd rather see the aftermath.

460
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,800
Rym: If you pull an awesome prank and I don't get to see the video of you telling the guy it was a prank, that's a definite minus.

461
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:49,120
Scott: Yes, it's basically we only want if you look at the title of your video, right?

462
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,978
Scott: When you when you put a video on YouTube, think about what the title of the video is going to be.

463
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:56,180
Rym: If the title is Guy Gets Hidden Balls, LOL.

464
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Scott: As soon as I push play, I should be seeing something already headed for his balls.

465
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:11,680
Rym: Or in the very least, I see like a shot from far away of a guy walking and at the same time a voice saying he's about to get hit in the balls and then immediately a ball hit.

466
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:17,478
Scott: Yeah, I don't want to see like some guy playing soccer for like 10 minutes and then a guy kicks him in the balls.

467
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,560
Scott: That's I don't have time for that.

468
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,599
Scott: I don't want to skip through YouTube video to find the exact point where the ball hitting takes place.

469
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,259
Scott: There's obviously one part of the video I want to see.

470
00:33:26,681 --> 00:33:28,380
Scott: So that should be the only part you put on YouTube.

471
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,660
Rym: Now, right along with that, don't upload a video of someone getting hit in the balls.

472
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,860
Rym: It's already been done.

473
00:33:34,164 --> 00:33:34,940
Rym: It's on the Internet.

474
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,340
Rym: Everyone has seen someone get hit in the balls.

475
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:37,792
Rym: Yes.

476
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:38,500
Rym: We need something.

477
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:44,819
Rym: YouTube doesn't need to be nothing but like horrible accidents and snuff films and people getting hit in the balls.

478
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,276
Rym: Cute puppies are OK.

479
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,820
Scott: Well, there are also a zillion cute puppies out there.

480
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:57,400
Scott: We need if you're putting something on YouTube and you actually expect, you know, you want a lot of people to look at it, make it something we haven't seen before.

481
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,540
Scott: Remember, most of the people looking at your video are people who go to YouTube a lot.

482
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:03,020
Scott: They or they go to dig videos.

483
00:34:03,262 --> 00:34:03,959
Scott: They've seen it.

484
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:05,019
Scott: They've seen it all.

485
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:07,500
Scott: They've seen the craziest batshit you can imagine.

486
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:08,639
Scott: They've seen Goatsy.

487
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,060
Scott: They've seen that Darth Vader in the supermarket guy.

488
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,139
Scott: They've seen Ask a Ninja.

489
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:19,199
Rym: So if you're you've got something, you think, hey, I want to put it up on YouTube and I want it to be like a big YouTube video.

490
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:23,540
Rym: I mean, of course, all these rules don't apply if you're just uploading it to send it to your mom or whatever.

491
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,100
Scott: Or again, if it's a short film, I'm talking about you expect me to look at it.

492
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,960
Scott: You expect it to be thing of the day material.

493
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:39,639
Rym: Now, in that case, search and see if anyone else has put up something similar and then think to yourself, one, is what I'm doing the same thing essentially as that?

494
00:34:39,942 --> 00:34:40,918
Rym: If so, don't do it.

495
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,341
Scott: Are they?

496
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,731
Scott: am I doing it better than the second question?

497
00:34:44,053 --> 00:34:45,780
Rym: is my thing better than that?

498
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:57,100
Rym: Because if someone has a cute video, for example, a cat parachuting off of a building and you make a video of that's a thousand times better of like a cat parachuting off of a building onto a dog, because that's better.

499
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:58,363
Scott: That is better.

500
00:34:58,684 --> 00:35:01,752
Scott: Or perhaps, you know, one guy has a video of.

501
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:04,979
Scott: I don't know, I can't think of a good example.

502
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,405
Rym: Wow.

503
00:35:05,445 --> 00:35:06,579
Rym: Scott, fail and lose.

504
00:35:07,783 --> 00:35:08,146
Scott: Yeah.

505
00:35:08,226 --> 00:35:10,220
Scott: Cat per 10 cats parachuting off of a building.

506
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:11,960
Scott: You can't parachute 10 cats.

507
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:13,259
Rym: I can't parachuting off.

508
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:18,558
Rym: And then when the other cat's parachute fails, he jumps down, saves the cat and then lands on all four legs because he's a cat.

509
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:22,340
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

510
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:24,140
Rym: I kind of want to do a crapo episode.

511
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,338
Rym: I think I'm going to go to bed.

512
00:35:26,003 --> 00:35:26,920
Scott: I think we should go to bed.

513
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,260
Scott: But I just want people when they make YouTube videos to actually think about what they're doing, put a little bit of effort into it.

514
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,079
Scott: I mean, if you're only going to put two minutes of video on the Internet, you should make those a pretty good two minutes.

515
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:50,039
Scott: You know, and you could, you know, even if your videos are not the greatest videos, if you actually put a little bit of effort into them, they'll get a lot more attention than they probably deserve.

516
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:58,380
Rym: And one last thing, we don't need any more videos of, oh, my God, some stater kids were kicked out of a place.

517
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,260
Rym: They were skating illegally by a security guard.

518
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,119
Rym: But look, the skater kids gave the security guard some guff.

519
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:05,060
Rym: There's been a lot of those lately.

520
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,998
Rym: I'm really sick of them.

521
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:07,379
Scott: There have been a lot of those.

522
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:09,220
Scott: And so it's it's tough.

523
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,003
Scott: It's it's annoying.

524
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:15,706
Scott: Don't make anything that, you know, some people are going to go, yeah, get grumpy about.

525
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:18,521
Rym: You want to make people getting people get grumpy about things all the time.

526
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:18,843
Scott: I know.

527
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:19,728
Scott: But you want to make a bit.

528
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:26,460
Scott: generally the best YouTube videos are the ones that just anyone can enjoy and not sort of the things that make people upset.

529
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:30,120
Rym: Scott, I would submit that the most popular videos on YouTube are people.

530
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:37,899
Rym: Well, maybe not the specific thing of people getting hit in the balls, but it is the spiritual equivalent of people getting hit in the balls.

531
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:39,466
Scott: That is the majority.

532
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:41,760
Scott: I'm getting kind of tired of those, actually.

533
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,560
Rym: Yeah, I'm just saying you don't have to make it something everyone can enjoy.

534
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,520
Rym: Just make it not be crappy.

535
00:36:47,443 --> 00:36:48,800
Rym: That's the only thing I care about.

536
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,980
Scott: There's one last thing to take into consideration, right?

537
00:36:51,080 --> 00:37:00,559
Scott: If you're putting up a video of, say, you know, mice going through a maze, you have to understand that someday someone's going to make a compilation of all the mice going through a maze videos on YouTube.

538
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:09,159
Scott: So design your video in such a way that when it is added to that compilation of a hundred other mice going through a maze videos, the year stands out.

539
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:19,460
Rym: Also, if you're going to make a compilation video, see what other compilation videos have already been made, because they're like a billion owned compilations.

540
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:23,983
Rym: And I think they all include the same clips just in different orders with different shitty music.

541
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:28,325
Scott: Yes, if you compile, do not compile what other people have already compiled.

542
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:30,020
Rym: or like the same thing with cute puppies.

543
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,980
Rym: There's one cute puppy compilation that's like the best cute puppy one ever.

544
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,800
Rym: Everyone else, don't bother.

545
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,751
Rym: It's already been done.

546
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:37,380
Rym: It's perfect.

547
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,440
Rym: You're not going to make it better.

548
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,960
Scott: Yes, but there is a. there's supply and demand here.

549
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,700
Scott: And the supply of cute puppy videos is well above the demand, even though that's an incredible demand.

550
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:47,900
Scott: The supply is that much more incredible thing.

551
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,940
Rym: There's a lot of cute puppies and a lot of cameras and YouTube.

552
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:51,602
Scott: Yeah.

553
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,119
Scott: Oh, well, do we got anything else to say?

554
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:57,900
Rym: I'm going to either play some natural selection or go to bed.

555
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,059
Scott: I'm going to go somewhere where they can eat some food.

556
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,580
Rym: I don't have to go to work tomorrow.

557
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,380
Scott: They get some air conditioning.

558
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:03,225
Rym: Amen.

559
00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:03,916
Rym: Amen.

560
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,970
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

561
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,590
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

564
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,809
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

565
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,350
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games and RPGs.

566
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:44,369
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

567
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:52,789
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknight@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via audio.

568
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,470
Scott: Just click the link that says send me an audio on the right side of our website.

569

574
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,730
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

575
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,290
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
