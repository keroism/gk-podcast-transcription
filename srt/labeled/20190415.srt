00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,067
Rym: It's Monday, April 15th, 2019.

2
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:11,929
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:12,410
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,973
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,920
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about The Humble Bookmark.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,217
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:24,107
Rym: So for the last like 10 years.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,213
Scott: That's a long time.

9
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:32,540
Rym: Every time we do GeekNights, I have to futz a little bit with, well I had to for a long time, futz with both our microphone stands.

10
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:34,834
Rym: I'd like I'd rearrange everything.

11
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:42,156
Rym: So a while ago I just got a boom arm for my microphone and I bought the cheapest boom arm that money could buy.

12
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,900
Rym: And it lasted about two months before I just broke.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,055
Rym: So then I bought the third cheapest boom arm that exists.

14
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:53,780
Rym: And so far it's going fine.

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,884
Rym: I feel like it'll last a while.

16
00:00:55,226 --> 00:01:03,735
Rym: But for the last 10 years I have had to, every time we do GeekNights, futz with Scott's microphone stand because it was just falling apart.

17
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,300
Scott: We bought it in the Beacon days.

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,942
Rym: Yep, we bought it.

19
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:07,644
Scott: At a Radio Shack.

20
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:08,406
Rym: We bought it.

21
00:01:08,426 --> 00:01:09,871
Scott: When Radio Shack was still in business.

22
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:16,223
Rym: We went to a Radio Shack and we bought two quarter-inch microphones.

23
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:21,960
Rym: I'm making a quote no emotion here because they were microphones in the barest possible sense.

24
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:27,700
Rym: We bought two Radio Shack branded microphone stands that were complete pieces of shit.

25
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:30,191
Scott: They were suitable for karaoke.

26
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:31,700
Rym: Yeah, at best, maybe.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,180
Scott: I think that's what they were mostly there for was like if you have a karaoke machine you lost a mic or something in order to add one.

28
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:45,560
Rym: Yep, so when we had Judith on the show the other day I had to get out the other microphone stand that's of the same ilk and set it up and it was even more broken.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,087
Rym: So I finally just I did that.

30
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:50,456
Rym: I avoided doing the thing that I'll often do.

31
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:51,520
Rym: Oh, that thing's broken.

32
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,040
Rym: I'll deal with that eventually and then proceed to never deal with it.

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,160
Scott: The thing you do is break the thing on purpose when you want to buy a new one.

34
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,238
Rym: Yeah, I really needed to break that shitty microphone stand to have an excuse to spend $12 on a microphone stand.

35
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,360
Scott: You love breaking stuff.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,735
Rym: Yeah, next time when some of your technology breaks, I will remind you.

37
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:09,780
Scott: When does my stuff break?

38
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:13,133
Rym: I recall a conversation recently where something of yours broke.

39
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:14,720
Scott: You mean my monitor that broke?

40
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:16,800
Rym: Yeah, why did you break your monitor?

41
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,607
Scott: It wasn't an excuse to buy a new one.

42
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:21,460
Scott: If you notice I just stole one of yours rather than buying a new one.

43
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,239
Scott: If I wanted to buy a new one I could just buy new ones.

44
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:27,320
Rym: You just broke it to have an excuse to steal my monitor.

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,920
Scott: I'm waiting for actually new 4k monitor models to come out, then I'll buy some.

46
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,420
Scott: I will say though in terms of the current models have been around for quite a few years I don't want to get one and then have a new one suddenly come out.

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,696
Rym: Yeah, that is why I upgraded every monitor we had at the same time And I just got three of the same 4k Dell.

48
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:47,014
Scott: As soon as this new 4k monitors I'm gonna be like, "Daddy,

49
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:47,136
Scott: too.".

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,080
Rym: So I thought about someone in the stream was pointing out they're watching GeekNights on the third monitor while they're working on stuff.

51
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,180
Scott: Third monitor, whoa.

52
00:02:53,381 --> 00:03:07,019
Rym: I had a use case for three monitors and my use case was I want, in the old days, two regular monitors side by side and then a third like 4x3 monitor to stick on the wall or something specifically for live streaming GeekNights-y type stuff.

53
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:10,658
Rym: There is no use for that once you have 4k monitors.

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,640
Rym: I have so many pixels here.

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,840
Scott: I don't really see people with three monitors very often except for like in financial offices.

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,820
Rym: Well when the third monitor is literally just like a status monitor.

57
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:32,220
Scott: But what I do see, at my work at least, is people who have a laptop and then they have two monitors on the desk and then the laptop becomes monitor three.

58
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,038
Scott: I just have one monitor on the desk and then it becomes two.

59
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,913
Scott: Especially since even though the laptop monitor is small, it's usually better than the desktop monitor because every laptop these days is like ultra tiny DPI.

60
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:46,757
Rym: Yep, Emily's Surface has a crazy...

61
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,020
Scott: Oh yeah, that's a great monitor.

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,228
Rym: That's such a good monitor.

63
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:50,620
Rym: I could use it as a main monitor if I needed to.

64
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,580
Scott: It's better than the Dell monitor.

65
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:54,076
Rym: It had more pixels than my old Dell UltraSharp, the 16x10.

66
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,240
Scott: The monitor that's built into a MacBook, a Retina MacBook, or a Surface Pro is like a crazy good monitor.

67
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,460
Scott: But no, the monitor in my laptop is like... This iPad screen right here is actually the best screen I own.

68
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:07,810
Scott: I own so many screens.

69
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:08,779
Scott: This is the best one.

70
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,310
Scott: It's like 1330 by...

71
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:13,740
Rym: like it's this ridiculous resolution.

72
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:23,518
Rym: Like some windows just won't fit, but holy crap once you have 4k pixels there's enough pixels even in one monitor to like do all the multitasking you want to do.

73
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,340
Rym: I am a big fan of the vertical monitor though.

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,879
Scott: I'm not a fan of the vertical monitor.

75
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,600
Scott: Because even people think though the use case for it is like when you're coding.

76
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,999
Scott: Nah, don't use it for that.

77
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,216
Scott: But the thing is when I'm coding I actually want... I do want more height than 16x9.

78
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:40,156
Scott: But I want to split it down the middle and get Daddy 2, right?

79
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:44,760
Scott: A vertical monitor is too wide and I can only see one file at a time.

80
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,339
Scott: I want to see two files at a time.

81
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:48,580
Scott: Basically what I wanted... Thermal and text editor next to each other.

82
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,320
Rym: What I wanted is two 4x3s to have the live stream thing and like the OBS thing.

83
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:58,300
Rym: And just putting a 4k monitor vertical cover that.

84
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,700
Rym: But yeah, the other notable opening bit because I was giving Scott time because he doesn't have an opening bit.

85
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,120
Rym: Apparently someone busted into my building and stole a bike from the bike room.

86
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,728
Scott: This room?

87
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,179
Scott: This building?

88
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:11,638
Rym: Yeah.

89
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,397
Scott: How'd they get in?

90
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:15,900
Rym: They must have snuck past the doorman while he was like doing something.

91
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:18,380
Scott: I mean I can get in but I mean how did they get in the bike room?

92
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,860
Rym: So the bike room was never locked but you lock your bike in the bike room.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,878
Rym: There's like bike racks in there.

94
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:26,718
Scott: Someone had a bike in the bike room that was not locked in the room?

95
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:27,988
Scott: Yup.

96
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:28,939
Rym: And someone took it.

97
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,360
Scott: However, as far as I can... How did they know it was someone who busted in and not another person living here?

98
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
Rym: So here's the interesting thing.

99
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,100
Rym: I guess they have video footage of like it happening and they know it's not someone who lives here.

100
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,880
Rym: But no one like reported their bike was missing and I was talking to some people...

101
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:46,379
Scott: Maybe someone just left their bike in here.

102
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,440
Rym: So I went around again in the bike room and did an inventory.

103
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:54,660
Rym: I'm like one of the only people who actually uses this bike room apparently.

104
00:05:55,521 --> 00:06:00,560
Rym: Most of the bikes in this bike room have had flat tires since we moved into this building.

105
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:01,539
Scott: Yeah it makes sense.

106
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,980
Rym: Even the doorman is pretty sure that most of the bikes in the bike room were owned by people who no longer live here.

107
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,359
Rym: And they're just garbage.

108
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,960
Rym: So I think there are six people who live in this building who actually use their bikes.

109
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,440
Scott: Why don't you just take possession of the other bikes and sell them all?

110
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,640
Scott: Well I was saying you could sell them or you could donate them.

111
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:33,860
Scott: There's a thing where it's like they... People... It's a place where people... Recycle a bike thing where you people learn how to maintain bikes.

112
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,058
Scott: And then well they also as a side effect...

113
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:39,017
Rym: You get the bike?

114
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:44,220
Scott: Well I think sometimes but they put together bikes for people that can't afford bikes.

115
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,800
Scott: They do the similar thing with computers.

116
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:52,260
Scott: You donate your computers, people learn how to build computers, and then they give computers to people who can't, you know, get a computer.

117
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,078
Rym: Not a bad thing.

118
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,900
Rym: But because of this bike stolen that no one noticed, now they lock the bike room and they won't give anyone a key but the doorman.

119
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,420
Rym: So what that means... So one day I go down, like I try to go down to the basement and all the stairways are locked.

120
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:07,338
Rym: Like I can't get in.

121
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,133
Rym: Okay.

122
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,160
Rym: So I take the elevator down, bike room's locked.

123
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,820
Rym: So now every time I want to ride my bike I go to the doorman.

124
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,060
Rym: He's got to come downstairs with me in the elevator and unlock the bike room.

125
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:24,840
Scott: So the building I'm working in now, which I'm not going to be working in too many months, but it is going to be for the summer so I'm going to have to do their shtick.

126
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:25,193
Scott: Yeah.

127
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,552
Scott: Right.

128
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:31,220
Scott: I noticed they had a bike room over by the service elevator and it said it was locked.

129
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:32,866
Scott: And it had a sign on it.

130
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:35,660
Scott: that said not responsible if you put your bike in here and it gets stolen.

131
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,300
Rym: That's fine.

132
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:38,600
Rym: I lock my bike even if it's in a bike room.

133
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,558
Scott: Yeah, I guess I'd have to.

134
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,397
Rym: Well, because people...

135
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,220
Scott: I'd much rather take it up the service elevator, put it in our office.

136
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:48,478
Scott: But I went and asked the doorman in the building and I was like, "Hey, how do I get a key to the bike

137
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:48,600
Scott: room?".

138
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,657
Scott: And he's like, "Ah, you just go to this, you know, office and talk to the person there and fill out a paper and they'll give you a key,

139
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:53,898
Scott: right?".

140
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,159
Scott: But then I was like, "Can I just bring my bike in the service elevator and not do

141
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:57,340
Scott: that?".

142
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,075
Scott: And he's like, "No, that's why I made a bike

143
00:07:59,115 --> 00:07:59,236
Scott: room.".

144
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,757
Scott: And I was like, "Aw, I'd really much rather just bring it to the

145
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,179
Scott: office.".

146
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,900
Rym: At least they have the bike room as opposed to the buildings that just make up a fake fire code.

147
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Scott: Well, I don't know what's in that room.

148
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,100
Scott: I'm going to have to take a look in there, right, before I decide what to do.

149
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,279
Scott: Who knows?

150
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:13,751
Rym: Yeah.

151
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,799
Rym: I've realized that one of the main problems not to turn into bike nights is that generally buildings... Like New York buildings are still really weird about bikes.

152
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,380
Rym: But basically, because of this, I talked to the doorman.

153
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,100
Rym: I was like, "Look, I bike to work every day once it's summer.

154
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:37,857
Rym: So you're literally going to have to come down and do this between two and four times a day, every single day, until it snows

155
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:38,159
Rym: again.".

156
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,778
Rym: And he looked at me and he was like, "Oh, goddammit, you're

157
00:08:40,798 --> 00:08:41,000
Rym: right.".

158
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:46,978
Rym: So my hope, and he is encouraging me in this, is to...

159
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,500
Scott: That you just make keys for residents like you to the bike room.

160
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,460
Scott: Just like the building I'm working in.

161
00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:03,920
Rym: Because so few people in this building actually use their bikes, pretty sure I will be able to convince the super after maybe a couple weeks of me being annoying and using the bike room constantly and causing a problem.

162
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:11,399
Rym: Because every time I want to get my bike, they have to lock the front door, unmanned the doorman spot, go down into the basement, deal with me, and come back up.

163
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:15,940
Rym: So I give the over/under his two weeks before the building just says, "Here's your goddamn

164
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:16,257
Rym: key.".

165
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,677
Rym: That's right.

166
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,859
Rym: So got some tech news?

167
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,020
Scott: Do have some tech news.

168
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:24,740
Scott: But first, I was just reminded of something that is tech news-ish.

169
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
Scott: That due to our discussion.

170
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:29,328
Scott: So there's a website people know about.

171
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:31,399
Scott: that is PC part picker.

172
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,380
Rym: Oh, yeah.

173
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:34,599
Rym: I vaguely remember that.

174
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:43,800
Scott: Where if you want to build a PC, you go to this website and you can pick your parts for your PC and make sure that you don't pick anything that's incompatible.

175
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,860
Scott: You know, they update the collections of parts.

176
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,320
Rym: Oh, someone built... Use a Pelican key.

177
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,960
Rym: They built their PC in a Pelican.

178
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:51,620
Scott: Okay.

179
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,458
Scott: Is that good for...

180
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:55,099
Rym: I guess you leave the door open when you're at the con.

181
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:55,820
Scott: Oh, okay.

182
00:09:56,502 --> 00:09:57,079
Scott: Oh, like that.

183
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:57,639
Scott: Oh, okay.

184
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:58,200
Scott: That's cool.

185
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,540
Scott: I guess you can't do it when it's closed.

186
00:09:59,760 --> 00:09:59,807
Scott: No.

187
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,080
Scott: So, but yeah, it's a really good website.

188
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:05,259
Scott: PC part picker, right?

189
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:14,179
Scott: If you want to build a computer, you might not use it for your actual buying because they do give you, like, affiliate links to buy all the parts at the places where they search for the lowest prices all around.

190
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,537
Rym: Yeah.

191
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:17,479
Scott: But what my thing... It's not my thing of the day.

192
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,809
Scott: It's just a side news.

193
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:21,459
Scott: is they have... They're putting out a new website.

194
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,000
Scott: You can see the link right there, right in the blog section, down to the right.

195
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:26,543
Scott: Oh, oh.

196
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:36,840
Scott: They had... Now they're developing cyclingbuilder.com, where you can build a bicycle part by part and it will make sure you don't build an incompatible bicycle.

197
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,280
Scott: Like, no, those tires won't fit on that frame.

198
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:43,920
Scott: No, that chain ring doesn't go with that bottom bracket.

199
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,419
Rym: No, you might naively think, how can a bike be harder to build than a PC?

200
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,590
Scott: I can build 100 PCs.

201
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,420
Scott: Building a bike...

202
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:57,059
Rym: Building a bike today is harder than building a PC was in the late 90s.

203
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,479
Scott: The main problem with building a bike is not that it's so difficult to do.

204
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,060
Scott: It's that you need specialized tools, right?

205
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,400
Scott: You can build a PC with the screwdriver to get, like, the bottom bracket into the bike.

206
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:13,738
Scott: You need, like, a special bottom bracket, like, pushing tool, right?

207
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,758
Scott: To even get the chain on and off, you need a special tool to, like, pop the pin out of the chain.

208
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:21,080
Scott: You need all these specialized tools.

209
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,360
Rym: Gonna true your wheel, because it's a brand new wheel.

210
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,498
Rym: I hope you have a wheel truer.

211
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,120
Scott: If you made the wheel, or you could have bought a true wheel.

212
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:29,519
Rym: Even if you buy a wheel, you usually have to true it.

213
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:30,353
Scott: Maybe.

214
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,887
Scott: The point is, building a bike is not as easy as building a computer, but many people do it.

215
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,460
Scott: You can buy components and build a bike, just like you can in a computer.

216
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,940
Rym: You know all those accounts, like, cursed rhythm controllers?

217
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,540
Rym: There's gotta be a Twitter account for cursed bikes.

218
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,339
Scott: I'm sure there are.

219
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,160
Scott: But anyway, the point is, this website is still in its infancy.

220
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:53,959
Scott: It works great, but the selection of parts is very, very low, because they have to enter so many of them by hand.

221
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:54,353
Scott: Yeah.

222
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,520
Scott: So it's like, they don't even have all the major, like, you know, different, like, group sets available yet.

223
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,455
Scott: But they're working on it.

224
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:02,419
Scott: So, over time...

225
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:10,940
Rym: Now I can figure out what derailleur or cassette I should use, because I wouldn't use this to build a new bike, but I would use it to replace parts on my existing bike.

226
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:15,178
Scott: I would use it to build a new bike, if I was gonna make a custom bike, but those are a lot of money.

227
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,480
Scott: That's the thing, is like, when you build a computer, you save money.

228
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,759
Scott: When you build a custom bike, you usually don't save money.

229
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:30,700
Scott: Because you're actually, it's like, when you're building the computer, right, it's like, you're paying this extra fee to someone to, like, combine all the parts, right?

230
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:36,080
Scott: And it's like, you think, no, you should be saving money, because they're mass producing the same computer, right?

231
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,859
Scott: It's like, no, it doesn't.

232
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,040
Scott: But with a bike, it makes sense, actually.

233
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:46,259
Scott: It's the correct way of things, where, yeah, you bought the mass-produced bike, not the custom bike, you saved money by not building your own.

234
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:49,680
Scott: So it's like, it's completely opposite in that sense, money-wise.

235
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:56,239
Rym: But I've been in the boat with my old mountain bike of, I need a new cassette, and the bike shops weren't super knowledgeable by me.

236
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,859
Scott: Well, the bike shops are knowledgeable here, if you go to the good ones.

237
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,300
Rym: Yeah.

238
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:01,420
Scott: Anyway, so that's just the side news.

239
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,419
Scott: My actual news is, New York Times, "Big companies thought insurance covered a cyber attack.

240
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:08,033
Scott: They may be

241
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:08,299
Scott: wrong.".

242
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,871
Scott: So here's the deal, big company, right?

243
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:14,719
Scott: Get hit with a cyber attack.

244
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,120
Rym: Which happens.

245
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,420
Scott: Their computers are just like, it's like a serious cyber attack.

246
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:20,699
Scott: Their computers don't work.

247
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,720
Scott: They can't email, they can't do shit.

248
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,760
Scott: The whole business comes to a screeching halt.

249
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,880
Scott: They lose a fortune in money, right?

250
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,616
Scott: And they're like, "God damn it, that

251
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:28,940
Scott: sucks.".

252
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,278
Scott: But that's what you get for not being modern in your ways, right?

253
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,420
Scott: It's just the consequence.

254
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,840
Scott: So they go to their insurance, and they say, "Hey, are you going to pay for all these

255
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,316
Scott: damages?".

256
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:38,638
Rym: And of course, the insurance says no.

257
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:40,979
Scott: It's not that the insurance says no.

258
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:43,899
Scott: That's obvious that the insurance would find any excuse to say no.

259
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,356
Scott: Yep.

260
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,456
Scott: It's the reason they said no.

261
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,759
Scott: Why did the insurance get away with saying no?

262
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,899
Scott: The insurance said no.

263
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:52,740
Rym: I see it here.

264
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,459
Rym: I hadn't read the article yet, but I see it.

265
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:02,000
Scott: Because they said that this particular cyber attack wasn't just some, like, rando cyber attack, right?

266
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:11,438
Scott: That it was a cyber attack by the Russian government and is therefore an act of war and the insurance specifically does not include war.

267
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:15,960
Scott: If your building gets bombed in a war, insurance doesn't cover that.

268
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,280
Scott: If it starts fire because of an arsonist, it probably is covered.

269
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,540
Rym: Even our homeowner's insurance.

270
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,639
Rym: Like, if New York got attacked by fighter jets, I don't think my homeowner's insurance or my renter's insurance...

271
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,655
Scott: It's not only... It specifically does not...

272
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,440
Rym: Right.

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,220
Scott: Acts of war are almost never insured against because otherwise, if a war happens, the insurance company loses all their money because everything is destroyed.

274
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,280
Scott: Basically, they can't be responsible even though an act of war would be rare, right?

275
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,779
Scott: Like, yeah, we'll cover that.

276
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,399
Scott: It's super rare.

277
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,480
Scott: That'll never happen, right?

278
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,840
Scott: That's the kind of things they like to cover.

279
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,780
Scott: Things that never happen.

280
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,720
Scott: The thing is, if it did happen, the insurance company would be on the hook to rebuild society.

281
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:55,420
Scott: That's why they can't insure war.

282
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,480
Rym: This is extra interesting part.

283
00:14:57,842 --> 00:14:59,780
Rym: Well, you know, it could be like Trigon.

284
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,940
Scott: But here's the case where they're claiming that it's war, even though this isn't the case where it destroyed all of society.

285
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:09,160
Scott: It only destroyed a few companies.

286
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,840
Rym: This is the case where they're saying it's a war, but it is an undeclared war.

287
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,600
Scott: That's right.

288
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,520
Scott: So it's like you could go to court and say this war wasn't declared.

289
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:18,695
Scott: It's not part of war.

290
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:22,280
Scott: If this was war, how come our government isn't warring back?

291
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,578
Rym: Well, I would argue that the Russian government...

292
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,720
Scott: There's so many arguments you could make in court to say it is or is not war.

293
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Rym: I'd argue that the Russian government is engaging in warfare with Western democracies.

294
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,039
Scott: And we're just taking it in the chin.

295
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,780
Scott: We're just letting them... It's like, oh, we're getting bombed every day.

296
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,598
Scott: We're not fighting back.

297
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,669
Rym: My measles news actually comes back to this.

298
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,480
Scott: We're not fighting back very effectively.

299
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:48,820
Rym: There's a lot of evidence that Russian bots are the main promoters of anti-vax.

300
00:15:49,140 --> 00:16:06,060
Scott: Anyway, regardless of the insurance reasons and the interesting topics business wise, right, it is nice to see someone get... It's not nice to see someone get cyber attacked, but it is nice to see someone suffer the consequences of not putting in the effort, time, and money to be cyber confident.

301
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:19,200
Scott: So no matter how dumb-o your company is, if you don't know them and their computers, you better pay people like us a lot of money to come who do know computers and then do what we say, or else you will not have your insurance pay you because of an act of war.

302
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:29,080
Rym: So counterpoint, though, when your adversary is just the seething mass of internet shitlords and hackers and mafia stuff, that's one thing.

303
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:34,840
Rym: When your adversary is actually state-sponsored, it's hard to defend against that.

304
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,900
Rym: Even good IT practices will not help you.

305
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,640
Scott: If it was a targeted attack, you are correct, like a Stuxnet.

306
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,460
Rym: Which in this case, it probably was.

307
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,138
Scott: No, it was not.

308
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,800
Scott: This doesn't seem to have been targeted.

309
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:48,100
Scott: This thing was just like spread around.

310
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,459
Rym: Oh, no, no.

311
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:52,240
Rym: So here's... If you are targeted by a state-sponsored actor, you're probably fucked.

312
00:16:52,781 --> 00:17:02,320
Rym: But if Joey Jojo Shabadu is targeted by a state-sponsored actor, you get caught in the collateral damage of that, you're still just as fucked.

313
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:02,940
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

314
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:12,300
Scott: But I mean, this is mostly cases where like, yeah, there are some dumb dumbs who work for you who downloaded email attachments and your IT department was not the greatest, right?

315
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,380
Scott: That kind of situation.

316
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:20,877
Rym: So I feel like this issue, at least in the United States, will not be dealt with in any way for at least a decade or two.

317
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,680
Scott: Yeah, this case was actually in London.

318
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:23,339
Scott: It wasn't in New York.

319
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,900
Rym: Which brings up NATO ramifications.

320
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,539
Scott: A place that has been bombed much more.

321
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:34,419
Rym: Yeah, this is a big deal that's not going to get dealt with correctly anytime soon.

322
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:34,816
Scott: Nope.

323
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:41,040
Rym: So in some other news, I'm sure you saw a global tragedy has occurred.

324
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,060
Rym: Notre Dame is basically burned down over the course of the last several hours.

325
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,135
Scott: I got only one thing to say.

326
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:47,478
Rym: You already got to say.

327
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:48,459
Scott: Looky mighty.

328
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:58,199
Rym: I am thankful that I was in Paris recently enough to have seen it in person because the entire interior is gone.

329
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,340
Rym: All that beautiful woodwork is gone.

330
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,580
Scott: I'm sure it will be rebuilt again for the X time.

331
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,959
Rym: It does not seem like it was malfeasance.

332
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,320
Rym: Well, not direct malfeasance.

333
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,540
Scott: It doesn't seem to have been that the person burned it on purpose.

334
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,180
Rym: However, I have seen some vague stories mostly coming out of mostly coming out of right wing nut bags.

335
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:20,731
Scott: No.

336
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:22,720
Scott: Oh, you mean the arson story?

337
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:31,240
Scott: Yeah, they are talking about the stories I'm seeing that are saying that basically what happened, it was under renovation at the time, and basically it was a mistake.

338
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,440
Scott: Something happened during the renovation that caused this.

339
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,739
Scott: It seems to be what happened, right?

340
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:45,962
Scott: But apparently there was a lot of fighting between the government, which owns it, and the church, which is using it, leasing it, whatever, allowed to busy borrowing it right over.

341
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:52,038
Scott: who is going to take care of these renovations because they're basically mad at each other that the place is a dump and who is going to take care of it.

342
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:53,500
Scott: You know, finger pointing.

343
00:18:53,580 --> 00:19:02,020
Scott: And then, you know, there's a lot of low bidding, embezzling, finagling, you know, kind of stuff going on with this renovation project.

344
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:08,898
Scott: This renovation project was apparently not 100% above board, full price, high quality deal.

345
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:14,480
Scott: And now all that dirty laundry, if any, will be aired, right?

346
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:18,799
Scott: It's like if you're under if you're bad deal goes and goes well, no one ever.

347
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:19,877
Scott: then everything is good.

348
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:23,540
Scott: But if you're bad deal, suddenly a building collapses or sets on fire.

349
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,619
Scott: Well, guess what?

350
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,020
Scott: Now your dirty laundry is out in the open.

351
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,754
Scott: Everyone can see it.

352
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,211
Rym: Yep.

353
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,924
Scott: So that's going to be.

354
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:33,480
Scott: the really interesting story is, you know, rebuilding the building.

355
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,100
Scott: It's like, yeah, they're going to rebuild it for the however many time.

356
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:38,760
Scott: It's a ship of Theseus anyway.

357
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:39,700
Rym: Yeah, right.

358
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,740
Scott: But, uh, you know, and they'll probably build it better than it's ever been built.

359
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,619
Scott: And it'll probably last way longer this time.

360
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:49,820
Scott: You know, Paris is pretty good about reducing the impact of fires.

361
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:53,800
Scott: They're not fireproof yet, but they're getting better.

362
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:54,460
Rym: Yeah.

363
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,699
Rym: Some red blood of angry men and such.

364
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,138
Rym: Yeah.

365
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:07,118
Scott: But the, uh, you know, the really interesting story is going to be seeing, you know, the people, the company hired to do this renovating and all that kind of fighting and see who gets in trouble.

366
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:07,580
Scott: Yeah.

367
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:08,677
Scott: How much trouble they get it.

368
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:09,036
Scott: Yeah.

369
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:12,480
Rym: Maybe you shouldn't entrust maybe a national treasure to the lowest bidder.

370
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,838
Scott: Maybe some insurance things going down to.

371
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:16,339
Scott: We got shitty stuff too.

372
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,499
Scott: Washington monument, I think I wasn't had some problems or maybe still does.

373
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:20,253
Scott: Right.

374
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,519
Scott: It's got some issues and that could fall and hurt somebody.

375
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:32,640
Rym: So in some other news that there don't seem to be a lot of super reliable news sources about this story, but it's really making the rounds.

376
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,640
Rym: I want to talk about it.

377
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,760
Scott: It's also funny because it's extremely related to a particular net runner car.

378
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:38,052
Rym: Yup.

379
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:50,699
Rym: So the story is that Pepsi announced a contract with a Russian startup to make an artificial constellation of cube satellites that will print fucking words for an advertisement in the sky.

380
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:52,940
Rym: Now there's two things to say about this one.

381
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:54,680
Rym: I am highly skeptical.

382
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:55,779
Rym: This will actually happen.

383
00:20:56,412 --> 00:20:56,558
Rym: Yeah.

384
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:58,740
Rym: Because this story looks pretty bull.

385
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,317
Scott: Think about it.

386
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,880
Scott: The, the space station, which is up there, which is bigger than a cube satellite, right?

387
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,898
Scott: Uh, you can see it as like a dot.

388
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:07,099
Rym: No, this would be easier.

389
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,196
Scott: You know how many of these things you would need to see?

390
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,980
Rym: Yeah, because you'd have mylar pointed back at the earth.

391
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:16,072
Rym: I guess our sales, like that would like.

392
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,999
Rym: theoretically, I can see how to get them lit up.

393
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:18,960
Rym: Yeah.

394
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:19,354
Scott: I don't know.

395
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,759
Scott: It's, it's very difficult to do it this way.

396
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:29,139
Scott: Uh, and yeah, in the U S it's actually illegal to advertise in space, but it's not illegal to do that in Russia.

397
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:29,812
Rym: Yup.

398
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:31,320
Rym: So I'll say two things.

399
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,459
Rym: One, I do not think this is a real story.

400
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,660
Rym: It is not going to happen, but two, if it does happen, we declare war.

401
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,960
Rym: That is a, I will become a revolutionary and shoot them down myself.

402
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:45,039
Rym: If I have to, that's right.

403
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:46,997
Scott: I'll go into space with a gun.

404
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:47,633
Rym: Yup.

405
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,330
Scott: Moonraker.

406
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:53,140
Scott: Uh, but yeah, there's a net runner card.

407
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:59,280
Scott: It was in the original, uh, at least Android net runner core set, not the old, old net runner, but you know, the newer anyway.

408
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:03,760
Scott: Uh, and it was the, it was an agenda called Astro script pilot program.

409
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:09,219
Scott: And the theme of the card was, was an NBN card, which is basically like, you know, cyberpunk CNN.

410
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:19,560
Scott: And the, the idea was that they were testing out using a laser to draw an advertisement on the moon so that everyone could see this ad all the time.

411
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:24,556
Scott: And it was one of the most broken OP cards that won me many tournaments until it was banned.

412
00:22:25,881 --> 00:22:30,520
Rym: So last and not least, I said, this is similar to the thing with Russia before.

413
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:33,157
Rym: So New York city, uh, is in the midst.

414
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,000
Rym: If you haven't noticed, Elvay really bad measles.

415
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:40,840
Scott: I heard this, uh, you know, Westchester is pretty bad.

416
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:41,377
Rym: Oh yeah.

417
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,340
Scott: But there's a few places that are pretty bad.

418
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,544
Scott: The places you would expect.

419
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:49,739
Rym: in Williamsburg alone, there are 285 people known to have contracted the disease.

420
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:50,417
Scott: That's a lot more.

421
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,640
Scott: That's more people than in like the last many years combined, right?

422
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:53,913
Scott: Yup.

423
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:56,156
Rym: 465 cases across 19 states.

424
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,417
Rym: This is a big deal.

425
00:22:57,881 --> 00:22:59,800
Rym: However, New York city has done something very important.

426
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,100
Scott: If you get measles, you are like gonna die.

427
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,778
Scott: It's not good.

428
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,360
Rym: Well, I mean, I have, I'm vaccinated, so I'm also vaccinated.

429
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:09,098
Scott: You know, but the point is you don't want to get it.

430
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,580
Rym: So New York city has ordered mandatory vaccinations in four area codes.

431
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:21,020
Scott: If we can do that, why can't we just order it for all people and say, if you don't vaccinate, you're kicked to exiled, even if you're a citizen.

432
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,059
Rym: So here's the problem.

433
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,938
Rym: Here's what's going on.

434
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:38,120
Rym: We've ordered this, but almost all of these cases are actually in one specific community in Brooklyn of Hasidic Jewish people who are specifically known for being extremely insular and kind of anti-government.

435
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:45,360
Scott: And there's a whole, it creates a lot of issues because, you know, when suddenly with your pro science, right?

436
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,300
Scott: You, it can now be misconstrued as being antisemite, right?

437
00:23:49,380 --> 00:24:00,020
Scott: And also antisemites will jump on the bandwagon with you and use the and say, no, no, I'm just being pro science so that they can be their antisemite ways while, right?

438
00:24:00,241 --> 00:24:08,339
Scott: For example, there was a story I read today that a bus passed by a Hasidic person without picking him up, which is not allowed.

439
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:09,599
Scott: That's inexcusable.

440
00:24:09,922 --> 00:24:12,680
Scott: But the bus driver was like, I don't want to get measles.

441
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:20,740
Rym: It's like, well, that neighborhood has the private sexism buses and all sorts of nonsense.

442
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:21,798
Scott: Lots of stuff going on.

443
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,120
Rym: But, uh, quote, the doctors are trying to screw us.

444
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,300
Rym: I'm sure of it said fairy schmelts, a 28 year old Yeshiva student.

445
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:39,140
Rym: So the interesting thing, if you're not familiar with Judaism, is that no sect of Judaism says vaccines are bad.

446
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:40,580
Rym: Like this is not a thing.

447
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:40,815
Scott: No, no.

448
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,157
Scott: You're right.

449
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:49,700
Scott: So not only is the Hasidic Jews have nothing against vaccine, not only are the vaccines specifically rabbi approved as kosher.

450
00:24:49,784 --> 00:24:49,934
Scott: Yeah.

451
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:50,400
Scott: Right.

452
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:53,440
Scott: And there's no reason not to get them in the in the Jewish religion.

453
00:24:53,942 --> 00:25:02,800
Rym: The Jewish religion, actually, you know, with all its crazy rules about not wearing two kinds of cloth at one time, it does have this very important exception that a lot of other religions need to have.

454
00:25:03,182 --> 00:25:06,140
Scott: It has lots and lots and lots of common sense exceptions.

455
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,856
Scott: For example, you're not allowed to drive in Shabbos, right?

456
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,000
Scott: Saturday, no car driving now because you're not allowed to start a fire, not allowed to work unless you're saving someone's life.

457
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:15,598
Scott: But guess what?

458
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,840
Scott: If you see somebody like dying, it's like, yes, you can drive the car.

459
00:25:20,107 --> 00:25:20,380
Scott: Right.

460
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:20,903
Scott: It's like.

461
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,759
Scott: it's all these common sense exceptions, like don't do this.

462
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:24,680
Scott: But guess what?

463
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:25,404
Scott: Oh, it's like.

464
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,920
Scott: it's like, all right, you can only eat the unleavened bread.

465
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:30,000
Scott: Oh, you would die without some real bread.

466
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:30,918
Scott: Have some yeast.

467
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,085
Rym: Yep.

468
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,527
Scott: Looking at you, Catholic Church, where celiac.

469
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:41,020
Rym: Well, if you have celiac disease, you just can't get communion because it doesn't count.

470
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,639
Scott: So even if even if the vaccine had like pig's blood in it.

471
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,319
Scott: Right.

472
00:25:47,884 --> 00:25:48,558
Scott: It would still.

473
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,537
Rym: Which it doesn't.

474
00:25:49,743 --> 00:25:50,279
Scott: It doesn't.

475
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,099
Scott: It's totally kosher.

476
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:55,940
Scott: Even if it did, it would still be permitted by most rabbis.

477
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,140
Rym: I imagine there's the interesting part among the that community.

478
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:01,519
Rym: There's a sort of subset of them.

479
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,920
Rym: That's sort of very anti-government.

480
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:08,320
Rym: But even them, their own rabbi was like, most of us are vaccinated.

481
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:10,999
Rym: And frankly, he's paraphrasing this guy.

482
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:19,079
Rym: I am annoyed at the very small number of members of our community who are for no earthly reason anti-vaccine.

483
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:22,780
Rym: But the article points out something very specific.

484
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,299
Rym: The reasons for the explosion of cases, because they're almost all in this community.

485
00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:41,060
Rym: Among members of insular, all the ultra-orthodox communities has to do with their frequent contacts with Israel, which is undergoing its own measles epidemic, combined with their insularity and general mistrust of the governments.

486
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:45,819
Rym: In addition, and this is the part I'm getting into, this is what's kind of fucked up.

487
00:26:46,442 --> 00:27:01,280
Rym: There is a widespread, I'm paraphrasing the article now, but there is a widespread misinformation campaign of fake robot phone calls and Internet stuff specifically targeting this community with anti-vax propaganda.

488
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:09,279
Rym: There is some evidence that that anti-vax propaganda that is also targeting Israel appears to be another Russian psy-op.

489
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:09,696
Scott: Yeah.

490
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:16,279
Scott: It's like, hey, let's just convince these Jews we hate because we're anti-Semites to not get vaccinated and they'll die.

491
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:22,996
Rym: Yeah, part of it is that Israel has no requirement for children to be vaccinated before grade school.

492
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:25,959
Rym: So there's a measles epidemic going on there.

493
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,468
Scott: And then because how do they not get measles there?

494
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:33,580
Scott: before, though, from what I can gather, people were getting it, even though it wasn't required until recently.

495
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:38,759
Rym: I think measles has been more of a problem in Israel than it has been in other places.

496
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:45,909
Scott: Why don't we do these kind of psy-ops against, you know, it's not like the people that we're fighting against.

497
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:46,600
Scott: are that geniuses.

498
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,480
Scott: Let's do, let's call up all like the crazy yokels in the US and tell them stuff that will get them to hurt themselves.

499
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,919
Rym: Should this be our next Monday or Thursday topic?

500
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,000
Rym: Would like modern anti psy-op psy-ops?

501
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,560
Scott: No, I'm not saying anti.

502
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:13,960
Scott: I'm just saying me more me more fair instead of all these because all the people not doing vaccines are like ultra religious Jews who've been opt and crazy hipster new age people who think vaccines give you autism.

503
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:21,900
Scott: But meanwhile, the friggin, you know, Republican people in Louisiana or Alabama or whatever are all getting vaccines.

504
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,020
Scott: Why don't we call them and convince them to get measles?

505
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:25,839
Rym: So there's another way to go.

506
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:32,459
Rym: I saw a meme making the rounds that someone's trying to push where they're trying to do the thing we always talk about.

507
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:39,180
Rym: They're trying to make a like viral meme that will spread among idiots that will cause them to do the right thing.

508
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,339
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

509
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:47,958
Rym: The meme is around how vaccines are effective, but they have toxins in them and the government will tell you what they are.

510
00:28:48,341 --> 00:29:03,660
Rym: If you take a raw potato, scrape it and apply it to the vaccination wound within six hours of getting the vaccine and hold it there and really rub it in, it'll draw the toxins from the vaccine out, but still give you the vaccination.

511
00:29:05,384 --> 00:29:06,619
Rym: Obviously, this is bullshit.

512
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,400
Scott: Yeah, but I think this is made by some Idaho potato farmer.

513
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:11,182
Rym: It's.

514
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:19,220
Rym: but it's the kind of bullshit that the kind of person who thinks vaccines will give their baby autism because of a Facebook meme might believe.

515
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:29,249
Rym: Anyway, it's time for things of the day.

516
00:29:31,011 --> 00:29:33,578
Rym: So you might have heard.

517
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:38,330
Rym: you might have heard of the extended one up sound that there's.

518
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,610
Rym: you might have heard that there's an alternate version of the one up sound in Mario three.

519
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:51,750
Scott: You might have played Mario three and occasionally while playing Mario three, notice that certain sounds override other sounds, certain sounds play strangely sometimes.

520
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:59,130
Scott: And you know, the sound is not the sound effects like the things that happen, like when you jump, shoot a fireball, hit a block, all the minor sound effects.

521
00:29:59,513 --> 00:30:01,390
Scott: There's some inconsistency to them.

522
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:06,989
Scott: And you can kind of feel it and like understand it when you're playing Mario three, especially if you played Mario three a lot.

523
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:08,010
Scott: Right.

524
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:13,469
Scott: But here's the video of the day that I know more about than he does, apparently, because I've watched the whole thing.

525
00:30:13,651 --> 00:30:14,330
Rym: I watched the whole thing, too.

526
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,389
Rym: So I would say like you might have heard this sound.

527
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,190
Rym: You might have heard people say, oh, there's a long version of the sound.

528
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,689
Rym: It's actually way more complicated than that.

529
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:27,190
Rym: The long version of the sound is not actually intended.

530
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:37,170
Rym: It's a glitch where the sound plays and based on a bunch of other parameters in memory, it plays part of a different sound with weird parameters.

531
00:30:37,311 --> 00:30:39,270
Rym: You get this glitched out version of the sound.

532
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:49,749
Scott: And actually it's so it's like this video explains how they came up with an elegant system for the sound effects that it handles priority because you only have so many channels that can play audio.

533
00:30:50,555 --> 00:30:51,690
Rym: You got to organize the sound.

534
00:30:52,091 --> 00:31:00,810
Scott: B, they had too many sounds, so they hacked on an additional duct tape solution to add extra sounds, which was pretty elegant, all things considered.

535
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,910
Scott: And then C, they coded away for this to still work, even though it's hacky.

536
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:10,610
Scott: And then there was a bug in that duct tape that caused it to be messed up.

537
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:15,508
Scott: But if you can actually fix that bug, if you patch your ROM or whatever, and then the sounds will won't ever mess up.

538
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,649
Rym: Yeah, I won't spoil it.

539
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,330
Rym: But the video is only like 15 minutes long.

540
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:22,650
Rym: And it really even if you don't know anything about computers, it explains it well enough.

541
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,510
Rym: You'll understand.

542
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,810
Scott: You'll also start to understand computers, hopefully.

543
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:38,270
Rym: Yeah, because remember, this is an NES like the bug is in basically a single CPU instruction to move data from one register to another register.

544
00:31:39,073 --> 00:31:40,289
Rym: Like that's the bug in the end.

545
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:45,590
Scott: So speaking of Nintendo console CPUs, I don't know when this was made.

546
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,688
Scott: This might be old.

547
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:51,030
Scott: Something similar might even think this might have been thing of the day at some point.

548
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:56,030
Scott: And I forget it, but it was making the rounds on the Internet very recently.

549
00:31:56,251 --> 00:32:02,110
Scott: So I'll take that as like, you know, I saw it posted in multiple places, which makes me think it's new or at least updated.

550
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:09,130
Scott: So what this is, is this is a complete manual to the CPU on the original Game Boy.

551
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:09,970
Scott: Right.

552
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,254
Scott: Like, I guess.

553
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:20,086
Scott: also it applies to every other thing like, I guess, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy, Super Game Boy, and it's got a bunch of typos.

554
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:27,470
Scott: I just noticed it applies to all the things that are game in the original Game Boy, anything that can play a gray cartridge.

555
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:33,890
Scott: But yeah, it's a complete CPU manual, tells you everything about how that Game Boy works.

556
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:37,250
Scott: And it was compiled by a whole bunch of people with very Internet names.

557
00:32:37,352 --> 00:32:37,868
Scott: Go to the top.

558
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:39,049
Scott: Let's see where their names are.

559
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,107
Rym: Oh, I was like Koopa.

560
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:40,669
Scott: Let's see.

561
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:40,906
Scott: Yeah.

562
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:41,330
Scott: All right.

563
00:32:41,591 --> 00:32:46,649
Scott: This document was compiled by a fan of anthrax.

564
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:49,309
Scott: Gabby Merritt Faison.

565
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,729
Scott: That's that's a dude name.

566
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:51,286
Scott: Yeah.

567
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,388
Scott: Pascal Felber.

568
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,428
Scott: Paul Robson.

569
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,109
Scott: That's a normal name.

570
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:55,728
Scott: Martin Korth.

571
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,805
Scott: That's a Koopa and Bowser.

572
00:32:58,872 --> 00:33:00,770
Scott: So it's like Bowser.

573
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:03,570
Scott: That's pretty, you know, for a non-official manual.

574
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:06,130
Scott: It's very complete and thorough.

575
00:33:06,371 --> 00:33:13,710
Scott: And if you read this and you could write some assembly and you get little flash carts, you can actually load your programs into your Game Boy or get a Game Boy emulator.

576
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:16,710
Scott: You can use this to make Game Boy software.

577
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:22,267
Rym: I have a soft spot for like the kind of complete documentation that used to come with computer things.

578
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:23,206
Scott: Oh, yeah.

579
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:25,830
Scott: It's good stuff in the moment.

580
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,210
Rym: The we don't have any conventions for a while.

581
00:33:28,452 --> 00:33:28,867
Rym: It's summer.

582
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:34,276
Rym: We're just hanging out, which means we're going to be making more like we're going to make Judge Anime by its cover.

583
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:37,030
Scott: recorded Judge Anime by its cover for the current season.

584
00:33:37,494 --> 00:33:38,730
Scott: I just have to put it together.

585
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,750
Scott: They changed their website.

586
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:43,069
Scott: So I had to do some programming to get my script, creepy script to work.

587
00:33:43,952 --> 00:33:47,050
Rym: Yeah, I'm getting our backlog of video together.

588
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:51,689
Rym: So I just uploaded our one of our panels for MagFest at the beginning of the year.

589
00:33:52,152 --> 00:33:53,469
Rym: Rare game mechanics.

590
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,669
Scott: Yeah, I'll have the have the judge uploaded soon.

591
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:56,066
Rym: Yep.

592
00:33:56,511 --> 00:34:00,430
Rym: I just finished editing our most recent talk, The Real Harm of Games.

593
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:02,770
Rym: And I'm going to post it as soon as I feel like it.

594
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,449
Rym: It's already on YouTube.

595
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:07,461
Rym: I just haven't made it public yet because I don't want to blow my whole load in one go.

596
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:08,549
Rym: Those have to wait.

597
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:12,049
Rym: I did some pre-production for the next episode of the Utena show.

598
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,830
Rym: You might have noticed a few episodes of our Utena show got taken down yet again.

599
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,255
Scott: Oh, no.

600
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,708
Rym: I'm in the process of fighting that yet again.

601
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:24,130
Rym: That's why we don't make anime content after we finish the Utena show.

602
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,310
Rym: I'm just never making an analysis show of anything ever again.

603
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,069
Rym: It's just not worth it.

604
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,929
Scott: Just don't put clips of the show in the analysis show.

605
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:34,310
Rym: Yeah, but showing the clip while we're talking is a big part of why the show is good.

606
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,409
Scott: Let's put it up on a different site and not YouTube.

607
00:34:36,713 --> 00:34:38,149
Rym: That's also a pain in the ass.

608
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,128
Rym: That's a big pain in the ass.

609
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:41,668
Scott: It's a thing.

610
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:43,808
Rym: Anyway, well, I'm working on it.

611
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,570
Rym: And The Geek Knights Book Club.

612
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,889
Rym: I have chosen a book which might be a terrible mistake.

613
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,650
Rym: We're reading Troy Dennings Pages of Pain.

614
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:56,170
Scott: I hope that reading it is not that the title is not taken literally.

615
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,867
Rym: Nominative determinism.

616
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,409
Scott: Yeah, I hope that doesn't happen.

617
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,990
Scott: But we'll see.

618
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:08,070
Rym: I have fond memories of this being shockingly good for being a branded Dungeons and Dragons book.

619
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:09,825
Rym: So we'll see.

620
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:12,690
Rym: And yeah, let's get right into it.

621
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:20,750
Rym: Because a long time ago in 1993, the concept of a bookmark appeared in the Mosaic browser.

622
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,630
Scott: So it's like we had web browsers.

623
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,710
Scott: People were typing in URLs and a really basic feature was added to the web browser.

624
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:30,490
Scott: Hey, you're visiting this web page a lot, right?

625
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:32,369
Scott: You're just going there over and over again.

626
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,170
Scott: You don't want to have to type in www.slashdot.org every freaking time.

627
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,030
Scott: Especially if they didn't really have auto-complete in the location bar.

628
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,270
Scott: They didn't have any of these features to make it easy to type in.

629
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,981
Rym: Dude, there were some websites I went to regularly.

630
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:47,930
Rym: that was literally just an IP address.

631
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,907
Rym: There was no DNS.

632
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:52,990
Scott: You didn't have tabs in the browser even in those days.

633
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,850
Rym: Dude, tabs didn't appear until we were in college.

634
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,081
Rym: Right.

635
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:00,807
Scott: So they made bookmarks where you would save the link to the web page and now you could just go to a menu.

636
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:04,009
Scott: They didn't even have the bookmarked bar then.

637
00:36:04,572 --> 00:36:09,428
Scott: You go to a menu and then you could click an item in the menu and that would take you to the page.

638
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:20,950
Scott: So you could just click two times and you didn't have to type in all this URL all the time and you could all your favorite web pages, all 10 of them, you could go to them over and over and over again very easily by clicking.

639
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:22,710
Scott: And that was the idea of a bookmark.

640
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:29,730
Scott: So when we were thinking about doing this show, I also, if you came across something interesting that had like a crazy long URL, you could save it for later and you wouldn't lose it.

641
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,170
Rym: I'd like, that's how I'd remember.

642
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:34,550
Rym: Like, Oh, this was that great site that had all those anime gifts.

643
00:36:35,312 --> 00:36:37,890
Scott: Oh, here was that Game Boy CPU manual.

644
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,887
Scott: Let me not lose this.

645
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:39,221
Rym: Yep.

646
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:52,050
Rym: Here's the link to that file share that has two hacked ROMs of Final Fantasy four and two, the NES one with the Japanese translated into English, like that kind of nonsense.

647
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:58,089
Scott: Over time, a lot of features are added to browsers, tabs, bookmark bar, all kinds of crazy stuff.

648
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,750
Rym: And also the internet changed seismically multiple times, right?

649
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:08,569
Scott: So the one, there are a couple of bookmark features though, that I'm upset that we're not, uh, Chrome doesn't have and Firefox does.

650
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:08,871
Scott: Well,

651
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:20,867
Rym: I got to back up a little bit further because I feel like if you chart a graph of how actively I curate my own bookmarks and use them in my day to day life, the graph just goes up and up and up and up and up and up.

652
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,767
Rym: And then there's a point where it starts going down and down and down and down and down and down and down.

653
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,750
Rym: I basically don't use bookmarks anymore.

654
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:34,590
Scott: That's what I'm saying is that all these other features that came along, made bookmarks get used less and less and less and less and less and less, right?

655
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:40,050
Scott: People keeps keeping tabs open because we have tabs now pinning the tabs to make them smaller, right?

656
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,430
Scott: All of these frequently used website just open all the time.

657
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,130
Rym: Also to quote a tweet that makes the rounds pretty regularly.

658
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:47,350
Rym: That is very relevant to this discussion.

659
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:50,850
Rym: Quote, I feel like there used to be more websites.

660
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,046
Rym: I mean, why not?

661
00:37:53,790 --> 00:38:00,188
Rym: My old bookmarks, which I have saved somewhere, like on the NAS, I have like bookmarks from high school Rym.

662
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:00,570
Scott: Right.

663
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:07,830
Scott: Well, I mean, for example, web comics, I used to have a bookmark folder and in that bookmark folder was a link to every single web comic I read.

664
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,850
Scott: I had a bookmark folder called web comics.

665
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:15,210
Rym: And then I had a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

666
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,450
Scott: I didn't separate them.

667
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:26,870
Scott: What I did is every day I would open up when I woke up, I would go to that folder and right click on it and I would say open all in tabs and it would open up a new window with one tab for every comic.

668
00:38:27,212 --> 00:38:29,930
Scott: And I would just press control tab going through each comic.

669
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:33,990
Scott: And if they were a new one, I would just tab over real quickly because it wasn't updated.

670
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:34,347
Scott: Yeah.

671
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:35,889
Scott: And I would just go through all of them.

672
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:38,470
Scott: And that was when I was reading web comics regularly.

673
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:41,550
Scott: And the failure of that is why I haven't been keeping up.

674
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:52,490
Rym: So part of this was that this was an era for a long time where there was no effective way to search for things on the Internet, like searching didn't really work.

675
00:38:52,910 --> 00:39:00,830
Rym: So if you found a website and it had good stuff, you needed to save it and remember how to get to it, or you might never find it again.

676
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:01,308
Rym: That's right.

677
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,990
Rym: That was that is literally what the Internet was like.

678
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:06,170
Rym: And there were a lot of websites.

679
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,929
Rym: None of them had URLs that meant anything to anyone.

680
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:18,830
Scott: So because you have tabs, because you have Google, because you have autocomplete in the browser bar, because we have so many things now that have made bookmarks obsolete.

681
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:20,650
Scott: And in fact, the two kinds of bookmarks.

682
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:26,830
Scott: There was the kind of bookmark where I need I go to the site all the time and the kind where this is an interesting article.

683
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:27,668
Scott: Let me save it.

684
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,930
Scott: The interesting article kind at even while bookmarks are still in use.

685
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:36,290
Scott: We started using Delicious to save those instead of using the browser.

686
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:39,390
Rym: I use Delicious so heavily until it disappeared.

687
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,870
Rym: And now it's not trustworthy.

688
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:41,767
Scott: No, you can't.

689
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,450
Scott: Delicious got bought and sold too many times.

690
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:44,108
Scott: Now it's dead.

691
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:48,510
Scott: But there's a website pinboard dot in that's not free, but it's really cheap.

692
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,270
Scott: It's like a couple of bucks a year or something.

693
00:39:50,776 --> 00:39:51,589
Scott: And I just use that.

694
00:39:51,711 --> 00:39:52,807
Scott: And then I use IFTTT.

695
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:59,649
Scott: And what I have it set up with IFTTT is basically if I favor to tweet and there's a link in it, it goes on the pin board.

696
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,035
Scott: If it automatically.

697
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:14,089
Scott: if I upvote something on Reddit or save something on Reddit or save something in Feedly or like any action I take on the Internet and any site that involves a link, I have it configured to put that link on the pin board dot in.

698
00:40:14,991 --> 00:40:20,310
Scott: And so now any kind of things I want to remember are just automatically all aggregated there forever.

699
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:22,509
Scott: And all my old Delicious bookmarks are important, too.

700
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:31,706
Scott: What's interesting is I almost never need to remember a link to anything because I go there to find the thing of the day I save, you know, if I like a YouTube video, it goes there.

701
00:40:31,955 --> 00:40:32,285
Scott: Oh, yeah.

702
00:40:33,132 --> 00:40:34,758
Rym: But I guess I like.

703
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:37,748
Rym: I just look at my own Twitter likes or I look at my own YouTube like.

704
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:39,389
Scott: they're all collected in one place.

705
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,068
Rym: That is true.

706
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,907
Rym: That is true.

707
00:40:41,412 --> 00:40:59,350
Rym: But I guess in terms of like when I'm using the Internet, like aside from the use case of Scott and I actually need to compile a list of things we're going to link to and talk about because we make gig nights in the rest of my life, I just start typing the name of the thing I'm going to and autocomplete and Google and everything just make it work.

708
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,810
Scott: They made some and I don't go to that many websites.

709
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,190
Scott: They made so many good features.

710
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,310
Scott: You don't need bookmarks.

711
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:04,748
Rym: What do I do?

712
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:08,270
Rym: I type I go to I type news that takes me to news that Google dot com.

713
00:41:08,572 --> 00:41:11,750
Rym: And then I type the noun that I'm looking for news about.

714
00:41:11,873 --> 00:41:12,067
Scott: Yep.

715
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:17,645
Rym: Or I just start typing like I don't know you and then YouTube because I'm going to be in YouTube.

716
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:24,930
Scott: So one of the features that I really like in Firefox is you can make a bookmark and you can add a word to that bookmark.

717
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:30,165
Scott: So, for example, I can make a bookmark to our website and then I could give it a keyword FRC.

718
00:41:30,752 --> 00:41:33,730
Scott: And now if I type FRC in the location bar, it goes to that bookmark.

719
00:41:34,152 --> 00:41:36,950
Scott: So you basically don't have to actually click on bookmarks.

720
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,389
Scott: You can just put in codes for them.

721
00:41:39,971 --> 00:41:45,650
Scott: Another thing you can do with that is you can actually make bookmarks of search bars.

722
00:41:46,032 --> 00:41:48,370
Scott: So you could go to say, what's a site that has a search on it?

723
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:57,870
Scott: YouTube, Wikipedia, you can go to Wikipedia, find the search box, right click on the search box, create a bookmark for the search box, then create a keyword on that.

724
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:00,230
Scott: So here's why that doesn't matter.

725
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:05,007
Rym: I type any random thing into just Google and it immediately always returns in almost all cases.

726
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,850
Rym: First result, the Wikipedia for that.

727
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:12,030
Scott: But what I do is I go to the location bar and I type wiki space thing and press enter.

728
00:42:12,131 --> 00:42:14,190
Scott: And I'm already on the Wikipedia page for that thing.

729
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:15,650
Scott: I can skip the Google page.

730
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,486
Scott: I save a whole page.

731
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,299
Scott: Right.

732
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:19,709
Scott: So those are some nice features.

733
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,410
Scott: But, you know, Chrome sort of kind of Firefox really implements.

734
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,550
Rym: Here's where this all breaks down.

735
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:34,864
Rym: Like I said, I used to use complex bookmark management things to do cool things, but I increasingly don't have the time.

736
00:42:36,312 --> 00:42:37,990
Rym: It's that it's not worth the effort.

737
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:41,810
Rym: The payout is too low to curate really anything anymore.

738
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:44,450
Rym: No, like I'm not willing to curate my bookmarks.

739
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:48,990
Rym: So even if those features are incredibly useful, very intuitive.

740
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,426
Scott: I only have like those two.

741
00:42:52,791 --> 00:43:02,790
Rym: But curating the data to make the features actually do it something better than just blindly typing nonsense into the browser URL thing isn't worth the effort.

742
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,417
Scott: So one there is one case.

743
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:08,250
Scott: I still use old school bookmarks in the bookmark bar.

744
00:43:08,372 --> 00:43:08,623
Scott: Right.

745
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,923
Rym: So the bookmark bar was what's in my bookmark bar?

746
00:43:10,943 --> 00:43:11,890
Rym: because I don't curate at all.

747
00:43:12,152 --> 00:43:13,030
Rym: I've got Webcomic.

748
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:13,889
Scott: You don't just turn it off.

749
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,630
Scott: If you don't if you're not using it, just turn it off.

750
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,630
Rym: I think I turned it back on.

751
00:43:17,771 --> 00:43:21,550
Scott: If I'm not using it at home, I have it completely turned off because I don't use it at home.

752
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,247
Scott: I only use it at work.

753
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:29,269
Scott: And at work, what I do is I basically fill up the bookmark bar with all the work shit that you can never remember the URL to.

754
00:43:30,537 --> 00:43:31,949
Scott: Like click on this to go to Jira.

755
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,390
Scott: Click on this to go to Confluence.

756
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,422
Scott: Click on this to go to GitHub to go to.

757
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:40,430
Rym: I just type at work.

758
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,110
Rym: I type J and it takes me to my Jira dashboard.

759
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:48,309
Scott: But it's like, you know, I have all these different software as it takes me to the Confluence page and I have to use it work.

760
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:56,090
Scott: So I have basically buttons for each one of them right in that bookmark bar, you know, and now you don't have to use that to go to a menu to go to bookmarks.

761
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,229
Scott: Now I can just click on any of the ones in the bar.

762
00:43:58,414 --> 00:43:58,730
Rym: Well, yeah.

763
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:07,489
Rym: So I realized my all I got in my bookmarks bar is one bookmark to this awesome looking website about wargame mechanics.

764
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,430
Scott: OK, is that the website with your adjacent triangle?

765
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:14,850
Rym: Uh, maybe.

766
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:18,910
Rym: It's just this looks like a really fascinating thing I want to read later.

767
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,048
Rym: I don't know why I bookmarked it.

768
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,829
Rym: And then I think of webcomics.

769
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,710
Scott: Did you press control D by accident?

770
00:44:24,212 --> 00:44:24,789
Rym: Uh, probably.

771
00:44:25,854 --> 00:44:27,088
Rym: Then I've got a list of webcomics.

772
00:44:27,413 --> 00:44:28,150
Rym: One I still read.

773
00:44:28,552 --> 00:44:29,970
Rym: One that's been done for years.

774
00:44:30,374 --> 00:44:31,109
Rym: One I still read.

775
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:35,008
Rym: The admin link for Kineticons like CMS.

776
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,290
Rym: A chili recipe.

777
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,710
Scott: Why is it a chili recipe in your webcomics bookmarks?

778
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,270
Rym: I probably hit control D. The old front row crew forum.

779
00:44:44,992 --> 00:44:45,829
Rym: Google News.

780
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:50,789
Rym: Oh, this place that had all the bootleg DDR roms that is totally still up.

781
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:51,567
Scott: Sweet.

782
00:44:52,012 --> 00:44:52,230
Scott: All right.

783
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,708
Scott: Send me that one.

784
00:44:53,017 --> 00:44:53,289
Scott: All right.

785
00:44:54,952 --> 00:44:56,610
Rym: And my streaming dashboard.

786
00:44:56,731 --> 00:44:58,710
Rym: So, yeah, I don't use bookmarks at all.

787
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:02,710
Scott: I do have a few bookmarks on my iPad iPhone.

788
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:03,970
Scott: They synchronize with iCloud.

789
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:04,712
Scott: They're the same.

790
00:45:05,114 --> 00:45:11,969
Scott: because it's not like, you know, you can really it's not the same UI on a phone where you're keeping the tabs open and stuff like that.

791
00:45:12,411 --> 00:45:18,210
Scott: So I just have like three bookmarks to go to like the forum and the pinboard.

792
00:45:20,437 --> 00:45:21,469
Scott: And that's really pretty much it.

793
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:26,470
Scott: Like I've realized because the other thing is the things where I'm on my desktop, right?

794
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:31,089
Scott: A lot of the tabs I have open in my browser on my phone have their own app.

795
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:33,330
Scott: No, it's like on my my computer.

796
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:35,770
Scott: I'll have like Gmail open in a tab all the time.

797
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,289
Scott: Don't need a bookmark on my phone.

798
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:44,330
Scott: There's a Gmail app, but like the forum is like the only thing that I need the browser for that I keep going to on my phone.

799
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:45,930
Scott: So that has a bookmark on the phone.

800
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:48,250
Scott: But it's like the only bookmark on the phone.

801
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:57,410
Rym: I guess as a result of Web 2.0 and maybe Web 2.5 and like the way the Internet is used today, I only go to like seven websites.

802
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:03,109
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing I'm saying is like back in the day, you go to a different website for each thing.

803
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:06,770
Scott: If you were interested in like 10 different people, they each had 10 different blogs.

804
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:07,787
Scott: You had to read everyone's blog.

805
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:16,430
Rym: My Delicious was so curated that I would I would do is I would basically search my own bookmarks to find something and I would use my text.

806
00:46:16,931 --> 00:46:25,600
Rym: I would look for like Tenchi anime minus a bunch like minus this tag plus that tag to find like the 40 websites I'd link to.

807
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,850
Rym: that had the one thing I'm looking for right now.

808
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:38,409
Scott: But nowadays you just instead of everyone having their own blog that you visit, everyone having their own GeoCities and all these different pages, you just follow everyone on Twitter and you go to one website, Twitter.

809
00:46:38,758 --> 00:46:38,885
Rym: Yep.

810
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,608
Scott: It's like or even even if you go to your Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, you just go to one of every social network.

811
00:46:43,912 --> 00:46:45,429
Scott: Dude, I don't ever run there.

812
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:46,410
Scott: Yeah, ready?

813
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:47,192
Scott: You know, but it's like.

814
00:46:47,654 --> 00:46:55,009
Scott: you don't need, you know, to have so many different sites because everyone is posting this stuff on the same site.

815
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:58,410
Scott: Yeah, I think just click links from there to other places.

816
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:04,389
Scott: So I don't need to bookmark your actual blog post, even if you link to it with a tweet, because I just favorite that tweet.

817
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:09,669
Rym: Well, the other problem I've had with bookmarks is that throughout all of my life, websites just disappear.

818
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:15,007
Rym: And even if you go to one website, links disappear because no one I feel like.

819
00:47:15,288 --> 00:47:20,706
Rym: for some reason, Scott and I are some of the last people on earth who are obsessed with maintaining link integrity forever.

820
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:21,489
Scott: That's right.

821
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:22,830
Scott: Our fucking website.

822
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,170
Scott: Open source people do.

823
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,990
Scott: They're like, you know, to this day, good URLs don't change.

824
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:34,170
Rym: If you got a URL to the GeekNights podcast, like a particular episode back in like 2005, that fucking URL will still get you there.

825
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:36,730
Scott: The thing is that the day might not work, but the URL does.

826
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:43,110
Scott: All the URLs of an old forum still work, kept the whole thing up, even though it's read only and some of it's broken.

827
00:47:43,371 --> 00:47:44,630
Scott: But you can still read everything there.

828
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:45,458
Rym: It is terrifying.

829
00:47:45,498 --> 00:47:46,550
Rym: how much content is in there.

830
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:46,985
Scott: Yes.

831
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:50,610
Rym: So is there a future for bookmarks?

832
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,890
Rym: Because I feel like this comes down to a much more fundamental question.

833
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,350
Scott: I don't think it's that, you know, who cares about saving or not saving bookmarks themselves?

834
00:47:57,492 --> 00:47:58,390
Scott: They're not the special thing.

835
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:07,229
Scott: They were just a solution to a problem and both the problem has been solved mostly like 90 plus percent by other solutions that are better.

836
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:11,410
Scott: And the problem itself has largely gone away also.

837
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:18,770
Rym: So people who are making bookmarks, features and browsers are saying, how do I make bookmarks usable and better when they're skipping?

838
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,990
Rym: There's the big question of why do you need a bookmark in the first place?

839
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:27,968
Scott: Yes, you built all these other things so that bookmarks are no longer needed and the world changed.

840
00:48:28,231 --> 00:48:32,150
Scott: So bookmarks are no longer needed as nearly as much, right?

841
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,349
Rym: Though there is one thing that happens to me every now and then.

842
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:39,143
Rym: Every now and then I need to log into like, I don't know, trying to think of an example of this.

843
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:46,290
Rym: The fucking like the website to file a New York state royalty tax thing.

844
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:50,690
Rym: I don't fucking remember that URL and I definitely haven't been to it.

845
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:51,506
Scott: You can't Google it.

846
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:55,250
Scott: I'd have to Google for it and find the New York state tax website.

847
00:48:55,431 --> 00:49:01,680
Rym: Yeah, and then maybe hunt around for it because usually there's like three different tax websites and they all do different things that are slightly.

848
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:10,948
Rym: so because it's got my website or what happens to me at work sometimes is I will be in a conference room as opposed to in my at my desk.

849
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:17,089
Rym: And I don't know the URL or even the domain of the thing I want to pull up.

850
00:49:17,431 --> 00:49:22,050
Rym: But all I know is that if I start typing the letter I at my desk, it'll get me there.

851
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:28,369
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I guess there could be cases like, you know, the other day I got my my annual free credit report.

852
00:49:28,735 --> 00:49:29,026
Scott: Oh, yeah.

853
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:30,910
Scott: And you know, there's a lot of sites.

854
00:49:31,191 --> 00:49:38,876
Scott: They try to scam you without a credit report to make sure there's one that is the government sponsored website.

855
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,450
Scott: that's like, you know, there for government.

856
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,930
Rym: You know, you know, I actually stopped even I stopped using that.

857
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,649
Rym: I get the free one from my bank.

858
00:49:47,372 --> 00:49:54,610
Scott: The one from the bank is apparently not going to talk about credit scores, but the one for the bank is a Vantage score, not a Fico eight score.

859
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,579
Scott: It's not exactly the same, but they're.

860
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,570
Rym: usually it's very rare that one of them is really bad and one of them is very rare.

861
00:50:00,651 --> 00:50:02,350
Scott: But the point is, I wanted to get the real one.

862
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:03,930
Scott: Just I haven't done in so long.

863
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:04,649
Scott: I'm just curious.

864
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,309
Scott: The funny thing is I can do it once a year.

865
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,269
Rym: So I just check mine because, you know, tax season.

866
00:50:09,471 --> 00:50:14,270
Rym: The only way my credit could possibly get better is if I am 20 years older.

867
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:15,255
Scott: You'll never create.

868
00:50:15,296 --> 00:50:16,607
Rym: better is if I buy a house.

869
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:17,870
Rym: I've never had a mortgage.

870
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,688
Scott: If I was rich or bought a house.

871
00:50:20,152 --> 00:50:23,150
Scott: Yeah, basically it's almost at the maximum.

872
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,550
Scott: The maximum is like eight fifty.

873
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:25,190
Rym: Yeah.

874
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,330
Scott: Mine's like eight twenty something.

875
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,370
Scott: Mine was eight thirty.

876
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:31,370
Scott: It might be eight thirty.

877
00:50:31,831 --> 00:50:32,528
Scott: It was up there.

878
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:33,669
Scott: It was really high.

879
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:38,708
Rym: Yeah, I forget the exact at the bottom is literally like get a mortgage or be older.

880
00:50:39,611 --> 00:50:43,590
Scott: Yeah, there wasn't much I could do to make it better because I've paid all my bills.

881
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:50,790
Scott: So I'll bet the only difference between yours and my point is bookmarking the the legit website, which I think is annual credit report.

882
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:52,189
Scott: Yeah, legit one.

883
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:53,789
Scott: Make sure you go to the legit one.

884
00:50:54,310 --> 00:51:03,570
Rym: You can use Wikipedia to confirm what you are bookmarking, like the specific website you log into to manage like the vision plan you get from your company.

885
00:51:03,653 --> 00:51:04,190
Rym: That's different.

886
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:08,230
Scott: That's the kind of stuff like a book market work where it's not something you can search for.

887
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:11,866
Scott: It's not like I can search for my company's H.R.

888
00:51:12,247 --> 00:51:12,730
Scott: systems.

889
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:13,590
Scott: You are out, right?

890
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,850
Scott: It's a. it's a particular URL that like only people at our company.

891
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:24,427
Scott: It's funny because of the nature of bookmark, you know, our forum, our website, whatever, because it's like a particular URL for us.

892
00:51:25,532 --> 00:51:29,112
Rym: I guess there is a fundamental question that we can ask, but not answer around this thing of that.

893
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:42,529
Rym: there were a lot of tools that we use and that people use related to the Internet in general that were really around the idea of if you curate a data set, you can make that data set extremely valuable to yourself and others.

894
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:45,721
Rym: But increasingly, it is.

895
00:51:45,942 --> 00:51:48,050
Rym: no one is willing to curate data sets.

896
00:51:48,534 --> 00:51:49,008
Scott: It's a lot of work.

897
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:50,410
Scott: Yeah, we want algorithms.

898
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:51,066
Scott: Just do it.

899
00:51:51,311 --> 00:51:53,089
Scott: But the problem is we don't do it by hand.

900
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:58,106
Rym: Algorithms will just work like autocomplete just finds everything.

901
00:51:58,166 --> 00:51:59,449
Rym: I want 99 percent of the time.

902
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:09,050
Rym: But no one can explain why the algorithm does A versus B. And that's why the fourth YouTube video in any search result is some Nazi shit.

903
00:52:10,854 --> 00:52:13,850
Rym: So I don't know what to do about that because I like curating data.

904
00:52:14,371 --> 00:52:17,030
Scott: People gamify the algorithm, right?

905
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,310
Scott: They try to trick it into showing their stuff.

906
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:22,810
Scott: And the people who try the hardest at that succeed to some extent.

907
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,788
Rym: I take a lot of photos and make a lot of video.

908
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:28,438
Rym: I cannot be asked to with the

909

00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:35,961
Rym: like asked, not asked, but asked to bother actually fully tagging all the photos I take in Lightroom

912
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,829
Scott: Yeah, it's not worth it.

913
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,956
Rym: I'm just talking about even my own content.

914
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:54,530
Rym: like my MP3 collection is curated to the point of obsession up until about 2003.

915
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,929
Rym: And then every music file I've gotten since then is just in a mess.

916
00:52:58,623 --> 00:52:58,769
Scott: Yep.

917
00:52:59,374 --> 00:53:00,629
Rym: And I will never fix that.

918
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,360

924
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,380

925
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,540
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

926
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:56,120
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights are... Oh, I got my monitor speaker on.

Rym: Let me turn that off.

928
00:53:58,521 --> 00:53:59,038
Rym: Much better.

929
00:54:27,783 --> 00:54:32,940
Rym: And now I leave you with... The future, of course, being virtual reality.

Rym: Something that's being talked about by other people, but produced by Sega.

931
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:44,335
Rym: Well, I can't get to the right page, but check out this little demonstration of VR.
