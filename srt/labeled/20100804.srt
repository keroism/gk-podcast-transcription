Scott: I'm Scott.

00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:15,020
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:17,980
Scott: Final thoughts on me pilgrim.

5
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:28,663
Scott: Let's do this clever girl.

6
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:32,741
Rym: I Realized I do the opener disproportionately.

7
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:32,922
Rym: now.

8
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:35,531
Rym: it used to be kind of 50/50.

9
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:36,194
Scott: I'm just lazy.

10
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:36,976
Rym: Yeah.

11
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:39,405
Rym: Yeah, plus it takes some effort to work up.

12
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:45,590
Rym: You know doing the show we talk normally But during that open it's like hey, it's I can't take that much effort.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,436
Rym: yeah, so we know Scott robot it in the last show and Basically, you know, I'll save this.

14
00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:54,841
Rym: I won't talk about it in the meta.

15
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:56,025
Scott: Am I roboting right now?

16
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:56,929
Rym: No, you're sure.

17
00:00:57,614 --> 00:00:58,200
Rym: Yeah, you're fine.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,470
Rym: I can see the levels But basically I did order, you know, we haven't upgraded our equipment in like two and a half there.

19
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:06,856
Rym: No, it was even before that.

20
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:08,542
Rym: It was fucking other than the new microphones.

21
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:09,346
Rym: We bought last year.

22
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:15,226
Rym: It was katsu Con the last katsu con we went to when we bought this fucking mixer.

23
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:15,687
Rym: Remember?

24
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:17,915
Rym: All right We lug that thing down to DC.

25
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:20,965
Rym: So we haven't really upgraded in a long time.

26
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,290
Rym: So we're going all.

27
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:24,456
Scott: There's a rule we have to upgrade.

28
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:28,030
Scott: we can't just stop we can't just reach the the necessary level and stop upgrading.

29
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,376
Rym: Oh, well, we always do.

30
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:31,245
Scott: maybe if this shit didn't break wouldn't have to upgrade.

31
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:35,070
Rym: No, it's not that it broke It's that's a pain in the ass to have more than two people on the show.

32
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,863
Rym: What with only having two inputs into the computer?

33
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:41,234
Scott: Oh That's it.

34
00:01:41,254 --> 00:01:43,043
Rym: Yeah, but I mean we're upgrading.

35
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:50,790
Rym: so hold off, you know next week I'm gonna be on vacation and then the week after that Fire wire might be a little while before the show sounds the same again.

36
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,560
Rym: Let's end the wires on fires might sound even better.

37
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,985
Scott: house burns down.

38
00:01:55,346 --> 00:02:00,629
Scott: get too many wires They're burning but much more importantly not my new wires the new RPG.

39
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:07,389
Rym: I got a gloat at least a little bit because I'm happy about this very excited because it turns out that Conrad and a bunch of our friends are also going to this.

40
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:19,882
Rym: So Scott the other day last week was like hey Rym There's some Twitter contest to win tickets to the upcoming Scott program pre pre-release, you know fancy You know see it ahead of time special tickets and all that.

41
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:21,350
Rym: and I was like, oh really, huh?

42
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,730
Rym: And I look at my Twitter and I see the things right there.

43
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,617
Rym: So I just reply and I got a ticket.

44
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,726
Rym: so I messaged Scott back two minutes later.

45
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,477
Rym: I'm like, yeah great I got two tickets.

46
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:30,589
Scott: Yeah, I didn't.

47
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:34,327
Rym: They're still doing the contest like I just tried again today.

48
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:34,689
Scott: I didn't win.

49
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:41,549
Rym: Ah So, so I guess Friday I could review Scott pilgrim.

50
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:46,845
Rym: The worst thing is I'm going to Wildwood and you know Emily's not going.

51
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:47,568
Rym: neither is Scott.

52
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:51,290
Rym: so Everyone else who's going wants to go see Scott pilgrim.

53
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:52,973
Scott: That's great.

54
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:55,242
Rym: Yeah, hopefully it'll be good enough to see twice.

55
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:57,210
Scott: Isn't it kind of interesting how it's like?

56
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,750
Scott: Yeah, I never go see movies really unless suddenly we're going to movies all the time.

57
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,466
Scott: No, this is ultra rare, you know occasion that I'll go see a movie.

58
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:05,490
Rym: just went to see Inception.

59
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,776
Rym: Now you're gonna go see Scott pilgrim.

60
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:08,022
Scott: dude is not a trend man.

61
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:09,006
Rym: That's a trend.

62
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:09,589
Scott: No, it's not.

63
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:11,794
Rym: I will say this.

64
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:14,646
Rym: I've realized I will say this is something I say a lot lately.

65
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:23,584
Rym: It's kind of replaced preface or to be sure or Suffice to say suffice it to say to be sure.

66
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:30,450
Rym: I must say as A fan of the Detroit Tigers one is definitely a fucking winning streak.

67
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:38,073
Scott: So the Tigers aren't that bad not anymore anyway Said lions.

68
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,598
Scott: That's what you should have said.

69
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:43,290
Scott: Yeah, you had this other far worse team in the same city.

70
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,136
Scott: I would argue you lie in second.

71
00:03:45,377 --> 00:03:49,130
Rym: The Lions are better for fans than the Detroit Tigers.

72
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,354
Scott: How so sure Tigers?

73
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:55,010
Scott: I mean maybe just cuz football is better but Tigers are kind of middle-of-the-road like nothing special.

74
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,678
Rym: They're not that great.

75
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:56,428
Rym: They're not that bad.

76
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,294
Rym: Lions are so bad.

77
00:03:58,354 --> 00:03:59,036
Rym: It's awesome.

78
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:03,310
Rym: It's like why it's like rooting for the mohawk guy and fist of the North Star.

79
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:06,075
Rym: You know, he's not gonna win.

80
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:09,046
Rym: You're really just there to see how awesomely he loses.

81
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:12,897
Scott: Anyway, the Yeah, right.

82
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:14,283
Scott: So - does not a trend make?

83
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:15,509
Scott: I think it's like okay.

84
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:25,278
Scott: first of all I didn't even see the second movie and you know, who knows if I will if everyone else is going to see pre showings I don't have tickets to Sure, you know and all these other shore showings.

Scott: What was funny is my not happen?

86
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:32,988
Rym: when I said to some people like yeah I got to go find some strangers to go with I was like, I'm seeing Scott Pilgrim and then movie alone.

87
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,032
Scott: That's so.

88
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:34,615
Scott: that's scary.

89
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:35,519
Rym: I used to do that a lot.

90
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:36,826
Scott: I just get.

91
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:48,222
Scott: when I lived alone Well, okay if you live alone alone I had I mean the only thing scary than going to a movie alone and you know is going to a restaurant said sit down Alone those old days before we did GeekNights.

Rym: I lived out in the mountains.

93
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:49,490
Rym: No internet.

94
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:51,301
Rym: I had to drive down the mountain for my robot in.

95
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:57,474
Rym: I would know you're not haha, I Lived the life of a hermit.

96
00:04:57,654 --> 00:05:01,526
Rym: I had effectively more free time than I could possibly fit spend.

97
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:02,750
Scott: and what did you do?

98
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,334
Rym: I did a lot.

99
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:05,138
Rym: I just didn't create.

100
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,870
Rym: I basically had a sabbatical and I don't regret those days.

101
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,016
Scott: You need some creating.

102
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:10,867
Scott: if there's no creating is it's not good?

Scott: The North America, I'm not gonna read it, you know.

117
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,549
Scott: verboten but verbatim.

118
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:51,959
Scott: Verboten Basically discotheque, which is an awesome Anime, you know and live-action movie distributor.

119
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,750
Rym: So they've already said they're going to release project a co and galaxy express.

120
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,192
Scott: What are you doing?

121
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:56,835
Scott: That's my news.

122
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,663
Rym: You use that news last time.

123
00:05:58,703 --> 00:05:59,165
Rym: Did I?

124
00:05:59,205 --> 00:05:59,547
Scott: Yes.

125
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:04,740
Scott: Oh fuck Wow I'm gonna find a new news not reuse my existing news.

126
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:07,047
Rym: So so I'll give you some time here.

127
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:13,345
Rym: Superman According to slashdot saved a family in no not Connecticut.

128
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:14,388
Rym: that says comic connect.

129
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:17,485
Rym: Never mind From having their house foreclosed upon.

130
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:22,770
Rym: All right Apparently they found action comics number one just in the basement.

131
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:24,856
Scott: That doesn't happen.

132
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:26,584
Rym: That's like they're like, what's this?

133
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:27,670
Rym: They sold it.

134
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:39,238
Rym: They made money to cover the mortgage and all I have to say to that is they shouldn't let the mortgage fail and kept the Comic, it'll be worth more than the house like, you know, it doesn't really rise As far as I know what.

135
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:42,829
Scott: the value of it doesn't really go up, you know It's just the condition of it can go down.

136
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:57,814
Scott: I would argue the value of an original of this will go up or at least a static plus inflation plus the value probably just went down because the Quanta known quantity just went up by one which is a large percentage of the Known known quantity.

137
00:06:58,296 --> 00:06:59,942
Scott: It's like there are only five of these in the world.

138
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:02,010
Scott: Okay, there are now six of them in the world.

139
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,449
Scott: Well, the price just went down.

140
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,633
Rym: So should I not?

141
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:10,210
Rym: were I to own action comics number one hire hitmen to take out other action comics number ones?

142
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,410
Scott: Yeah, you should collect them all into a bundle.

143
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,350
Scott: That way you say there's one bundle of them and then you'd be like, well if anyone wants one you got to buy this bundle.

144
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:19,490
Rym: Actually, here's a way to make copies all together.

145
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:20,654
Scott: How many copies say?

146
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,742
Rym: you have ten copies of action comics number one.

147
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:24,890
Rym: can't have tank and say there's only 15 left in the world.

148
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,151
Rym: Right.

149
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:26,015
Rym: I've got ten.

150
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:26,778
Scott: I don't know how many.

151
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:27,963
Scott: there's probably a lot more than that.

152
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:28,364
Rym: I'm just.

153
00:07:28,445 --> 00:07:29,710
Rym: I'm just making up numbers.

154
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:34,130
Rym: So let's all right, so I make a YouTube channel I make a live TV stream and all this.

155
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:38,381
Rym: I hold it up and hold up a lighter and I say for the next week.

156
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:40,046
Rym: I'll be accepting donations.

157
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:43,819
Rym: if I do not get $50,000 worth of donations.

158
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,682
Rym: I'm burning it.

159
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,512
Rym: I'm killing the hostage P.

160
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:48,716
Scott: I don't think you'll get enough.

161
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:50,422
Rym: I think I would.

162
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:52,409
Scott: you would make more than that just selling one of them.

163
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:59,206
Rym: Well, the real way to do that is to burn a fake action comics to prove that you're serious and then threaten to burn another fake one.

164
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:04,550
Scott: And I wasn't able to find the news really in the time.

165
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,509
Rym: I use this like fluff Superman thing to stall for time and you still got nothing.

166
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:11,676
Scott: It's not easy to find news.

167
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:13,523
Rym: is he watching any anime right now?

168
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:15,170
Scott: Oh, you know, you want me to do that?

169
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,020
Rym: Okay, we should we should get but you know, we did.

170
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:20,939
Rym: we haven't talked about a lot of Current or even old anime lately.

171
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,163
Rym: We haven't been reviewing a lot of shows.

172
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,830
Scott: I've been busy as I check this out.

173
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,452
Scott: I watched.

174
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:29,230
Scott: I watched a bunch of animes, but I will talk about Space Symphony my tell, right?

175
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,712
Scott: I watched the whole thing and Really?

176
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:34,534
Scott: It's it's.

177
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,785
Scott: it's kind of nice because it's modern animation and pretty good production quality.

178
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:40,068
Rym: There's a big butt hanging here.

179
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:44,442
Rym: What you said like it's nice and there's a it's.

180
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:50,482
Scott: it's supposed to be a prequel to Galaxy Express 39 and literal prequel or Matsumoto Ian freak.

181
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:50,943
Scott: No, it's.

182
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:52,870
Scott: it's actually to the TV series.

183
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:55,741
Scott: It's or the first movie you could.

184
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,889
Scott: it's an actual prequel and it makes sense.

185
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:05,437
Scott: The thing is is the first part of the show itself Isn't really consistent with itself.

186
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:07,242
Scott: It's like what the hell is going on.

187
00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:08,165
Scott: It's like one second.

188
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:15,289
Scott: It'll be like, you know Andromeda will be you know cool and then the next she'll be a bitch and then she'll be cool again and then a bitch.

189
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,958
Scott: and It's like what is going on.

190
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:21,165
Scott: and it's like it's clones, but then it's not close but then it's the real one but it's not the real one.

191
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:25,930
Rym: and then it's like Could that is that really continuity or just characters being all over the place?

192
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,690
Scott: It's just the characters of a. it's like the first part of the show.

193
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:30,476
Rym: It's not so it's not continuity.

194
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:32,604
Rym: Like the backstory was this.

195
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:33,928
Rym: now, it's this.

196
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:39,870
Scott: no It's like the just the show is all over the place for the first few episodes and then they eventually sort of get in line.

197
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:45,736
Scott: And this day it's like, okay now we've got here's the actual thing Yeah, and then it stays can?

198
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:51,775
Scott: it's like it like it fluctuates crazily and you're watching like the first handful episodes You're like just what what.

199
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:53,079
Scott: I thought that she what.

200
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:56,250
Scott: and then after a few episodes finally it settles down.

201
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:58,002
Rym: It's like ah, well, I've been.

202
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:03,004
Rym: I got to start up again But I was watching giant to robo with some people who haven't seen it.

231
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:38,864
Rym: It is a show of escalating danger But the jackal gets points just for the fact that if they were initial D That is the equivalent of Shingo after he fails to do his thing Pulling out dynamite killing everyone at the finish line and then burning down Mount Akina.

232
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:40,970
Scott: Yeah, where do you see guys like Souther?

Rym: there's no way to see it.

314
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:20,580
Rym: as far as I can tell I couldn't find any bootleg Like cam cap of it or anything, but I did fine randomly I wish I realized this was here the opening animation to last year's Otakon Otakon 2009.

315
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,040
Scott: It looks like I was under the impression that there was some rights issues and they couldn't put it out.

316
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,044
Rym: So it looks like they could.

317
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:30,506
Rym: as far as I can tell looks like this was put out by Otakon and they couldn't put out 2008 and 2010 but 2009 has very few in literally put out by Otakon.

318
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,442
Scott: Are you sure?

319
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:36,708
Scott: that's pretty sure.

320
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:39,200
Scott: you sure that's an official Otakon YouTube channel.

321
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:43,536
Rym: I'm pretty sure but I don't know it was linked to by an Otakon staffer in the forum.

322
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:50,714
Rym: not this video But this channel, okay, so that's good enough for me but this is the Otakon 2009 opening animation.

323
00:16:50,734 --> 00:17:02,719
Rym: in case you didn't see it and I really want all their anime cons to do this because the Daikon animation in this whole imagine of Otakon They showed the Daikon animation and then showed,

324
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:09,121
Scott: you know The thing is, you know Otakon is basically using its its partnerships with Japanese animation studios to make What

325
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,060
Rym: if they just got some fans every year to make one?

326
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,019
Scott: What if they made it at the convention and showed it when the convention was over?

327
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,151
Rym: Do you know how fucking impossible that would be?

328
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:17,720
Scott: It could be like 30 second animation.

329
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,911
Rym: Do you know how fucking impossible that would be?

330
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:20,554
Scott: It could do it.

331
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:29,454
Scott: It takes a while to animate especially if you had guys like, you know with skills like the We're gonna have enough trouble editing our thing for PAX together by Saturday night.

332
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:30,958
Scott: Some professionals are gonna do it.

333
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:37,279
Rym: Yes Okay, anyway and also, you know, I have two things of the day two links here because that's cool.

334
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:39,887
Rym: But here's a video.

335
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:42,715
Rym: Uh, it is on the internet.

336
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:44,439
Rym: So I'm gonna link to it.

337
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:48,030
Rym: It is video from the concert of Suguzo and Yoshiki.

338
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,080
Scott: The concert where there are absolutely no cameras or recording.

339
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,602
Scott: You know what?

340
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:54,816
Rym: There are a million freaking videos from Otakon 2010's concerts.

341
00:17:56,661 --> 00:18:03,640
Rym: So if you missed the concert if you missed Otakon you can go see the concerts on YouTube even the Yoshita brothers one.

342
00:18:04,403 --> 00:18:05,387
Rym: I didn't actually look for that one.

343
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:08,420
Rym: I just looked for the ex-japan one because that's the one I was interested in.

344
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,344
Scott: I'm interested in the other one.

345
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:10,671
Rym: I've got your shita brother.

346
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:11,494
Rym: Yeah, I'll see.

347
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:13,021
Rym: I'll look right now It's not.

348
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:13,342
Scott: I'm sure.

349
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:16,050
Scott: there's plenty of your shita brothers period all over YouTube.

350
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,297
Scott: So even if the Otakon one is not there.

351
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,696
Rym: Yeah panel panel.

352
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:23,019
Rym: Yeah, here it is Q&A performance.

353
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:24,926
Rym: Yeah, it looks like it's here.

354
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:26,814
Scott: All right, at least enough of it's there.

355
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:27,216
Scott: Yeah.

356
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:30,686
Rym: Yeah So the meta moment.

357
00:18:30,706 --> 00:18:31,669
Scott: Are we roboting yet?

358
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,251
Rym: No.

359
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:35,160
Scott: Okay, Gen Con starts tomorrow.

360
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:39,053
Scott: Oh crap, you should go and see Luke and Jared there.

361
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:40,478
Rym: Yes, we will not be there.

362
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,918
Scott: In Indiana I'm trying to cover the non New York things.

363
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,175
Scott: Mozilla drumbeat is this Saturday in New York.

364
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:46,659
Rym: In New York?

365
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,446
Scott: Yeah, let's see.

366
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,071
Rym: So you didn't make a list ahead of time.

367
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:53,038
Scott: PAX is I'm looking at my Google Calendar.

368
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:53,520
Scott: It's my list.

369
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:57,298
Rym: We're gonna be there doing crazy shit.

370
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,787
Scott: Recess is the weekend after that.

371
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:11,416
Scott: Maker Faire is two weeks after that And then at 10 10 10 that weekend is is the burning con but also the New York Comic Con and also the New York anime festival and also nerd NYC board game night.

372
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:15,780
Rym: Next week There may or may not be shows because I'm gonna be out of town at our annual writers retreat.

373
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:17,587
Rym: Scott will not be at the writers retreat.

374
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,394
Rym: So yeah, we'll see how much I write.

375
00:19:19,594 --> 00:19:21,020
Scott: and then magfest is next year.

376
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,605
Rym: Whoo, magfest.

377
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:25,654
Scott: I don't I don't believe we should ever.

378
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:27,740
Scott: everyone has balls of Steve balls.

379
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:30,391
Rym: We should never say woo in regards to magfest.

380
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:32,579
Rym: There's only one appropriate response and that is hot.

381
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:38,260
Rym: And like I said, we're upgrading the studio equipment.

382
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:49,462
Rym: so give it a week or two and we're gonna start bringing a lot more guests on the show because I'll basically Quarter the time it takes to edit and like do post-production on guest shows Mm-hmm.

383
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:52,152
Rym: So we're up in the ante there quite a bit.

384
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:52,834
Scott: All righty.

385
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:58,013
Rym: All right, so Thursday Scott Pilgrim opens for me next Thursday.

386
00:19:58,033 --> 00:19:59,520
Rym: Scott Pilgrim opens for everyone else.

387
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:04,260
Rym: So I figure we should do a final thoughts on the comic because it's one of the great comics we've read in recent.

388
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,725
Scott: You know, that was my show idea.

389
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:07,491
Scott: Yeah, it was not your show idea.

390
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:12,830
Rym: It's a GeekNights show idea which shared responsibility Only comic that we had both read recently.

391
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:15,339
Scott: Yeah, that is the reason that is the show.

392
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:20,479
Rym: I can't believe you didn't even read awesome thoughts because we've already done a show.

393
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,887
Rym: All right, here's the before we get to spinal thoughts and spoilers.

394
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:23,870
Rym: Here's the review.

395
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,787
Rym: if you were between the ages of 17 and 31 I know.

396
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:32,020
Scott: the thing is I've got like 40 year old people who are reading it and digging it.

397
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,771
Scott: It's sort of weird like okay.

398
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,100
Scott: Let's discuss this whole issue, right?

399
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:41,540
Scott: I was sort of under the the opinion that like, okay There's only certain people who will get this, you know.

400
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,625
Scott: And and like if you're too young or too old you just is not incomprehensible and to an extent that's true My grandma would never get it.

401
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,814
Scott: My mom probably wouldn't even really get it.

402
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,240
Rym: But yet Emily's parents love it.

403
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:56,689
Scott: Yeah, so it's like, okay It's not really you know, this there's no like.

404
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,840
Scott: there is definitely a subset of people who will get it.

405
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:21,560
Scott: Doesn't have a universal appeal of something like Star Wars where everyone gets it, you know, it definitely is limited but It is also broader than you would suspect like a lot of people are suspect, you know, it's would think Oh, this is only for like, you know 20 to 30 year olds who play grew up with any S's and no one else is gonna even understand anything.

406
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:32,540
Rym: I think that's not sure who is really for is there's a kind of specific Culture and upbringing that together can create the kind of person who will appreciate Scott Pilgrim.

407
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:38,762
Scott: Yeah, I definitely think even though some like Emily's parents might enjoy it There's no doubt that they view it differently than we view it They have to.

408
00:21:38,822 --> 00:21:44,522
Rym: but at the same time I would argue that the core message of Scott Pilgrim is Timeless.

409
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:53,292
Rym: for anyone who had those experiences and the video game II all that Timeless message, but it's presented in a non timeless manner.

410
00:21:53,553 --> 00:21:55,922
Rym: Yeah, but the core message I think comes through no matter what.

411
00:21:55,982 --> 00:22:02,264
Rym: so I think really anyone who is astute and Had those experiences Appreciated Scott Pilgrim.

412
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:11,787
Scott: Yeah, the thing is I have a feeling that unlike say a will Eisner or you know Carl Barks or You know a Tezuka, right?

413
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:14,799
Scott: This is not a timeless work like a hundred years from now.

414
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:18,261
Scott: Most people are probably gonna read it and go what the fuck, you know It's.

415
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:24,300
Scott: it's not the kind of thing that people will be able to read a long time from now and it'll still work.

416
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:33,626
Rym: Well, what'll be interesting is to go go back you know 50 years from now and see what else did Brian Lee O'Malley do and Will Scott Pilgrim be like.

417
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:34,831
Rym: this is where it all began.

418
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:37,560
Scott: Well, he's like in his mid late 30s, right?

419
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,423
Rym: He's got some time.

420
00:22:38,563 --> 00:22:44,564
Scott: Yeah, so, you know that there is definitely, you know, it's not like 31 To be clear.

421
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:46,592
Rym: a lot of people don't realize he's done other stuff.

422
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:47,335
Scott: Yeah.

423
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,078
Scott: What was that other thing?

424
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,727
Scott: He did The one with the sad girl on the cover.

425
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:53,016
Scott: Yeah, I forget the name of it sad girl in snow.

426
00:22:53,056 --> 00:22:54,376
Rym: Wait, that's Fred Gallagher person.

427
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,669
Scott: No, he's a comic artist.

428
00:22:57,689 --> 00:22:58,556
Scott: He's done a lot of comics.

429
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:00,463
Scott: Yeah More.

430
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:05,528
Scott: Oh, you know, you hope he doesn't just like roll around in his movie moneys But I don't think he's that kind of guy.

431
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:07,659
Scott: I've met him a couple times and you know, he's just he's.

432
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,220
Scott: you know He's chill.

433
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,586
Scott: He's not one of those crazy kind of.

434
00:23:09,606 --> 00:23:12,820
Rym: I guess the best way to review not just the comic but before we get into spoilers.

435
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,839
Rym: And the final thoughts cuz I really want to get right to that and just spoiled because it.

436
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:16,849
Rym: you know That's the discussion.

437
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,163
Rym: We all want to have The.

438
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:28,060
Rym: the whole Scott Pilgrim franchise has been handled Almost I would argue maybe better than any other similarly potential franchise has ever been handled.

439
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:30,800
Rym: We have to see the movie see the video game to see for sure.

440
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,925
Rym: but look at what happened.

441
00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:37,725
Rym: the comic resonated among a certain fan group like many things do and Any time there's something like that.

442
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:38,527
Rym: We're nerds.

443
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:39,992
Rym: We sit around and say man.

444
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,740
Rym: What if they made a movie about Scott Pilgrim?

445
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:50,287
Scott: Well, it's weird because Oni didn't really do anything like to promote it that you know They don't do for any other comic right?

446
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:53,780
Scott: It's not like they put Scott Pilgrim like all over the fuck, right?

447
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,060
Scott: They just put it out just like they put out every other Oni comic, you know.

448
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,860
Scott: And I've got other Oni comics like what was that one wanton soup, right?

449
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,774
Scott: They put that out and they had the same promotion as you know, Scott Pilgrim did.

450
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:09,952
Scott: they never really pushed it hard They didn't you know, it was just out the same as every other comic yet.

451
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:12,904
Scott: It sort of picked up on its own and became Crazy huge.

452
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:14,313
Rym: Yeah, I'm not talking about crazy huge.

453
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:15,300
Rym: I'm talking about more.

454
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:16,043
Rym: So look at this.

455
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:16,706
Rym: they make the comic.

456
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:22,239
Rym: nerds sit around whenever there's a comic or something they like and say man Would it be awesome if they just made a sequel like this?

457
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,808
Rym: What if they made the movie and got so-and-so to play?

458
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:26,394
Rym: it seems like everything.

459
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:29,049
Rym: nerds who were fans of this said wouldn't it be awesome?

460
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,565
Rym: if is Basically what they did?

461
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:32,810
Rym: what if they made a movie?

462
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,140
Rym: Yeah, they should get like Michael Cera to star in it.

463
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,165
Rym: Oh, they got Michael Cera.

464
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:39,440
Rym: Oh, what if they made a video game and he was like, oh they made the video game.

465
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,144
Rym: They made it exactly.

466
00:24:40,164 --> 00:24:44,243
Scott: we were saying with that that guy the the cabana battle guy We were saying he shouldn't.

467
00:24:44,303 --> 00:24:49,740
Scott: just you know, we were always disappointed that he basically made pirate and a cabana battle should have been a game.

468
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,944
Scott: Yeah, why wasn't it again?

469
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:52,228
Rym: So nerd said man.

470
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:55,077
Rym: What if the pirate baby cabana battle guy?

471
00:24:55,117 --> 00:24:56,160
Rym: wouldn't that be crazy?

472
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,363
Rym: Well, it was like.

473
00:24:57,383 --> 00:25:02,440
Scott: it was like we wanted him to just make a game period and then we wanted a sky pilgrim game period.

474
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,880
Scott: And then they combined to lack of two unfulfilled potentials into one.

475
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,619
Scott: They you know that that would be like if you know, you made a new.

476
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,693
Scott: You made the New Super Metroid game, right?

477
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,180
Scott: But it was also Like, you know reviving some long, you know, well, that was a terrible example.

478
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,765
Scott: I didn't think of any good example.

479
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:30,100
Rym: I failed so but it's every step of the way, you know nerds man the video game.

480
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,273
Rym: What if they got on a Monoguchi to do the music?

481
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:32,494
Rym: Yeah.

482
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:33,520
Rym: Well, they just fucking did that.

483
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,510
Scott: You know, I don't like on a Monoguchi that much I do.

484
00:25:35,671 --> 00:25:38,243
Scott: I've seen him live a few times I don't know.

485
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:40,795
Scott: I don't understand why people know I really like them.

486
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:43,366
Rym: I don't like them live But I like their music on its own.

487
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:47,140
Scott: No, I've listened to it on the youtubes a couple times and not I'm not a fan.

488
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,786
Rym: It's good music for Scott pilgrim though.

489
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:51,916
Scott: Probably it's alright, but it's only for the video game.

490
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:52,920
Scott: They're doing the music, right?

491
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,648
Scott: Yeah, they're not doing the movie music Someone else's but that's kind of.

492
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:59,800
Rym: they've taken all the things that nerds would say.

493
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,431
Rym: Would it be awesome if and done the equivalent.

494
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:11,155
Scott: there are some nerds out there who are like, yeah They should have done a different thing, you know I'm not arguing there aren't but the majority of the kinds of things they did like Michael Cera.

495
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:16,435
Rym: getting him was like the crazy nerd Choice and the fact that they actually did it was just surprising.

496
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:21,618
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, I get the feel it's one of those things where you know, I don't I don't think it's.

497
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:24,160
Scott: you know They did everything that nerds wanted perfectly.

498
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:32,326
Scott: But I think it's definitely a situation where usually when a nerdy thing is adapted, especially into a movie the nerd They made the do movie.

499
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:32,849
Rym: What did nerds want?

500
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:34,700
Rym: They're like, yeah, is it gonna be set on Mars?

501
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:37,500
Rym: Is it gonna be about a space marine?

502
00:26:38,704 --> 00:26:39,656
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't.

503
00:26:40,563 --> 00:26:47,480
Scott: You know, it's these kinds of things right Pete the nerds are like, you know How much does it match the original and it in this case?

504
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:58,500
Scott: They have matched the original, you know enough to where there are no like Super huge complaints like even like Watchmen movie, you know people got something to complain about or spider-man movie.

505
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,192
Scott: They got something to complain about but there's organic web shooters.

506
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:03,416
Rym: I mean exactly right.

507
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:04,921
Scott: so with Scott Pilgrim It's not.

508
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:11,421
Scott: nothing is perfect, but there is far proportionally less to complain about than with any other nerd Adaptation.

509
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:16,276
Rym: I mean the only person who could possibly play Scott Pilgrim better than Michael Cera's probably our friend Conrad.

510
00:27:16,296 --> 00:27:22,660
Rym: Oh I can think of few people that is that guy, you know, he doesn't really even movies.

511
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,226
Rym: Have you seen with him in them?

512
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:24,849
Scott: We saw you.

513
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,411
Scott: he's there.

514
00:27:25,672 --> 00:27:27,420
Scott: I remember he's the arrested development kid, right?

515
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,965
Scott: Yeah, I think the one thing.

516
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:30,471
Rym: so what else have you seen with him in it?

517
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,546
Scott: I'm sure I know anything about him I'm sure I have but I just don't.

518
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,634
Scott: you know, remember that you probably haven't.

519
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:38,942
Scott: is that he's always sort of like He's?

520
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:42,958
Scott: you know, Scott Pilgrim is sort of like excitable like hey, and he doesn't seem.

521
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:43,742
Scott: you know He doesn't.

522
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:48,246
Scott: he has all the other qualities of Scott Pilgrim except these sort of Excitable quality like you need.

523
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,920
Scott: they need to give him like a caffeine injection for a few of the scenes and then it'll be alright.

524
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:53,409
Rym: See, I think they will.

525
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,040
Rym: this is actually I think a big test for him.

526
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,321
Rym: They're good.

527
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,084
Rym: We're gonna find out.

528
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:58,974
Rym: can he alter his like milieu?

529
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:00,600
Rym: Can he act differently?

530
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,200
Rym: Can he pull off Scott Pilgrim or will he be Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim?

531
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,882
Scott: Well other people have seen the movie already, you know No one's.

532
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:11,236
Scott: that's one thing that I think they were doing really interesting with this marketing right for the movie?

533
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:15,775
Scott: is the movies been done Done for a while and there's so many screenings?

534
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:31,780
Scott: are so many Pre-release screenings all over the fucking place like crazy, which I think is like a genius idea You know, like why isn't everyone doing that for anything that's popular, especially for something that's so nerdy You know is gonna be passed around the Pirate Bays, right?

535
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,649
Scott: Obviously, you should just get the screenings out there.

536
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,097
Scott: cuz what's keeping the movie from being released.

537
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:37,760
Scott: It's well.

538
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,280
Scott: Why don't they put it out a day earlier?

539
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,940
Scott: Well, cuz they need to get the reels of film or whatever to every movie theater at once.

540
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:43,965
Rym: I screw that deal.

541
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:46,520
Scott: if they got they got they definitely have one made by now.

542
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,439
Scott: They have a bunch just don't have enough for every theater.

543
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,380
Scott: So as they're sending them out, they're like, okay, dude, do a previews you got one in your theater.

544
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:53,687
Scott: I don't think that's a freaking previous.

545
00:28:53,728 --> 00:28:58,129
Rym: I don't think that's it at all because at least in all the cities I mean digital projection is becoming the standard.

546
00:28:58,149 --> 00:28:59,134
Scott: Yeah, but even so you need to.

547
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,640
Scott: they mail hard drives to every theater.

548
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,320
Scott: Yeah, but they don't do it where you download it from the internet.

549
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,077
Rym: They've been doing pre screenings far longer than it takes to ship the movie out to everywhere.

550
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:07,840
Rym: I don't think that's it.

551
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,056
Rym: I think it's more a long-term buzz building system that also it's.

552
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:13,100
Scott: it's a it's a multiple.

553
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:14,871
Scott: It's many birds with one stone cuz.

554
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:15,273
Rym: look what else.

555
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,320
Rym: serenity did that too?

556
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,492
Rym: There were a fucking million screenings of serenity before it was in.

557
00:29:19,512 --> 00:29:21,620
Scott: I definitely think you need to do that for nerd movies.

558
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,372
Scott: Otherwise people just get their preview screenings on the internet.

559
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:27,257
Scott: and at least when you do a preview screening in the theater You can get some monies.

560
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:33,240
Rym: Now that you don't pay for these screenings unless you get someone else to pay for like the pre-screen tickets and give them away.

561
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:36,413
Scott: Yeah, I mean there what do you think the people were giving away?

562
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:37,780
Scott: the tickets are not, you know.

563
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,325
Scott: There's money being changed hands.

564
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:43,279
Scott: Maybe maybe the movie theater isn't just letting all these people come in for free.

565
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,289
Rym: Yes What what we don't know is who is paying.

566
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:51,308
Rym: we don't know if the production company is paying or if like Midtown Comics Paid for the tickets.

567
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:52,454
Rym: for you know, we don't know that.

568
00:29:52,494 --> 00:29:56,630
Scott: but you know what I do know Popcorn monies, they're making money as popcorn.

569
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:57,514
Rym: notice an inception.

570
00:29:57,775 --> 00:29:58,960
Rym: the other than a few fat people.

571
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,883
Rym: No one bought shit.

572
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:10,186
Scott: Everyone smuggled stuff in and that's just because it happens to be next to a Duane Reade that particular Lot of the multiplexes.

573
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:11,210
Scott: like thing about Tinseltown.

574
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,418
Scott: right Tinseltown is out in the mat Scott.

575
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:16,779
Rym: It's not a Plexus it's just multiplexes that aren't in cities.

576
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:25,500
Scott: Yeah, look at any theater and they put him out in the woods separate from everything else with a giant parking lot So that there's no drugstore right next to it.

577
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,980
Rym: No, they do that because the lands cheap and people can drive that too.

578
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,687
Scott: But it's also that you know, there's.

579
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:33,520
Scott: no I don't think there was a candy store right next to the movie theater.

580
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,680
Scott: But like alright fuck we're screwed.

581
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:41,900
Rym: So if Duane Reade were smart, they would open Duane Reade movie editions next to every theater and sell smuggleable goods.

582
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:43,017
Rym: They basically have that.

583
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:44,627
Scott: Okay, and you just have to be smart.

584
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:47,159
Rym: I would advertise I'd be like smuggle this shit into the theater.

585
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:58,872
Scott: I'd sell flat drink containers You're not you know, you can't get drunk in a movie theater.

586
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:00,258
Scott: that's bad they can that's not.

587
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:01,726
Rym: it's not a lot You can't just know.

588
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:06,297
Rym: it's not any more not allowed than Smuggling in my dorsey does?

589
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:09,959
Rym: I don't even know what a do-si-do is drunk on the do-si-do.

590
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:14,560
Scott: I guess if I soaked him and get a make you're gonna make a loud do-si-do ruckus and barf the do-si-dos.

591
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:16,775
Rym: We don't get in in New York.

592
00:31:16,815 --> 00:31:17,460
Rym: that bothers me.

593
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,705
Rym: But the Texans get it the adult only theater with the fine dining and the movie at the same time Mm-hmm.

594
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:24,637
Rym: Why don't we have that?

595
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:28,420
Scott: Because the space versus money is not a good I know but I want it.

596
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,207
Rym: I would be willing to pay a lot for that.

597
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,794
Scott: not enough people will agree.

598
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:32,477
Rym: Yeah, but I do.

599
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,504
Scott: I mean So, you know what?

600
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:35,691
Scott: I got a guy got one for you.

601
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:38,978
Scott: It's right over in the other room Don't only?

602
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:47,860
Rym: Yeah, if you pay me whatever you were gonna pay that movie theater, okay But one thing if I pay you sparks money, I expect sparks quality.

603
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:55,229
Scott: I'll just go to sell this, you know You got to pay me a little plus sparks money because you get a movie too and then I'll go to sparks and keep the Profit and I'll just go to the sparks.

604
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,540
Scott: I'll just about bike it back over here or take a cab.

605
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,047
Rym: Yes, now my steaks cold great.

606
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:00,071
Scott: I'll put in microwave.

607
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:02,020
Rym: Yeah, it's gonna be a great steak.

608
00:32:02,342 --> 00:32:03,270
Scott: Actually, I'd be really good.

609
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:12,648
Rym: probably not No Because the point of the run of the raw steak is that it's sizzling hot and blackened on the outside and it is cool And raw on my way over there.

610
00:32:12,668 --> 00:32:15,900
Scott: I'll mug the Pizza Hut guy and take his little in you know insulator.

611
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:23,537
Rym: Nah, all right Scott Pilgrim We're going to spoil the ever-living shit out of the common volumes one through six.

612
00:32:23,597 --> 00:32:24,400
Rym: Yes all of it.

613
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,624
Rym: We're going to spoil it.

614
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:26,667
Rym: Do not listen.

615
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:29,575
Scott: Seriously actually no just if you're.

616
00:32:29,635 --> 00:32:32,859
Scott: if you if you're like Haven't read it all what the fuck?

617
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,400
Scott: Seriously, go read it and then listen to this episode like right now like pause the episode and read it all and then unpause the episode.

618
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:46,216
Rym: I was not surprised when Scott Pilgrim died me either but I like how they handled that.

619
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,038
Rym: He's like am I dead?

620
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:51,398
Rym: No Actually, yeah, you are dead and then he only came back because the extra life.

621
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:55,500
Scott: Yeah No, I mean the the extra life was such a check-offs extra life.

622
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,142
Scott: Yeah, there was.

623
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,829
Scott: no, you know, the thing is it's.

624
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,568
Scott: it's weird like I don't know if I should admit this But basically I read.

625
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:02,759
Scott: I made a bit sort of a mistake.

626
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:07,260
Scott: I read each volume as it came out and I never reread any volumes.

627
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:11,960
Scott: So I forgot many details and rears basically each volume.

628
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:23,480
Scott: I was almost like starting a new and I didn't remember everything from the previous volumes and I only remembered like the most You know biggest important information and I didn't really remember a lot of the small stuff.

629
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:29,740
Scott: I remember the one up but I didn't remember like a lot of other things at all like had the glow, right?

630
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:30,602
Scott: glowing.

631
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:44,776
Scott: and I was listening to some reviews of that other people did of the early episodes like comedy speak just did a review of the first two volumes right because they never read it at all and They noticed they actually mentioned specifically having read only volume one and two.

632
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:45,840
Scott: like why is she glowing?

633
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,340
Scott: And I was like, I didn't even notice it and only in volume six did the right.

634
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:59,184
Scott: But if I had read them all at once again And I probably will read all six just in a row plan to read them all again Then I probably it would stand out like a sore thumb Yeah, or things like.

635
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:05,567
Rym: I think a lot of people actually forgot about Simon and that whole, you know prelude Cuz I came back in a big way at the end.

636
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,975
Scott: Yeah, I don't really remember that either.

637
00:34:08,076 --> 00:34:10,003
Rym: What really know How are you gonna?

638
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:10,967
Rym: What do you remember?

639
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:12,793
Rym: It's like you never remember anything from stuff.

640
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:13,295
Rym: We watch.

641
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:16,002
Scott: I remember Scott pilgrim.

642
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:17,746
Scott: he had banned he was going.

643
00:34:17,908 --> 00:34:22,956
Rym: I remember in the beginning the river city ransom where he saved came pine from Simon on the roof.

644
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:25,491
Rym: Yeah in their backstory.

645
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:32,060
Rym: Oh In the back story, yeah Remember at the end, you know what it turned out to be.

646
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:33,635
Rym: He was just some nerd and it was just.

647
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:41,719
Rym: you know The whole time we have all these like memories that we take is true Like that's the way it was and volume six basically said no, here's the reality.

648
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:43,563
Rym: Here's what really happened.

649
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:49,870
Scott: people just forget what happens when you read volume one like over a year before you read volume say I don't have this problem.

650
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:51,060
Scott: So I had this problem.

651
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,600
Scott: You know, you know, that's why I get trade paperbacks.

652
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:57,450
Scott: I don't get the individual issues because you get the individual issues.

653
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,298
Scott: It's like, you know, you read, you know It's basically an issue a month.

654
00:35:02,702 --> 00:35:09,662
Scott: So by the time if it's something's five issues It's five months since you've read the first issue and you read so many comics, you know It's like.

655
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:11,748
Rym: I will say I was wrong about the glow.

656
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:25,443
Rym: all through this all through the whole series until the end when you find out what all that was about I Thought that the glow kind of symbolized going back to the real world and I thought this was all gonna be some sort of weird World.

657
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:26,546
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean that's sort of.

658
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:32,978
Rym: we're poisoned with that right from seeing too many things where anytime, you know dog I heard you like to dream so I put a dream in your.

659
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:36,273
Scott: yeah I don't want to spoil like ten things right now, but there are a lot of.

660
00:35:36,494 --> 00:35:37,760
Rym: we can spoil whatever we want.

661
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,948
Scott: You want to spoil I go Tana?

662
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,743
Scott: Yeah Go big.

663
00:35:41,884 --> 00:35:42,988
Scott: Oh, there's something to go.

664
00:35:43,048 --> 00:35:52,683
Scott: Yeah, there's so many things that we've watched especially animes Where there's a world where crazy shit that magic happens and then at the very end of the show It's actually.

665
00:35:52,764 --> 00:35:53,688
Scott: no it's actually not.

666
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:57,305
Scott: you thought it was a fantasy world this whole time, but you know, it's not a fantasy world It's a real world.

667
00:35:57,345 --> 00:36:00,162
Scott: and here's a real explanation for all that shit you saw.

668
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:03,137
Scott: that was that looked like fantasy, but guess what is not fantasy?

669
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:10,027
Scott: and So of course reading Scott Pilgrim when you've got people going like through dimensions to deliver Amazon I've already combined is a bird not Kim pine.

670
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:13,299
Rym: when when she disappeared Ramona all I thought was she's in the real world.

671
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:20,020
Scott: now Yeah, you know stuff like that, you know anytime magical shit happens like okay that one up actually just came out of nowhere.

672
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:25,380
Scott: Okay, the skateboard proficiency thing, you know, it's like, okay, you know, there's obviously crazy magical shit.

673
00:36:25,842 --> 00:36:28,740
Scott: There's obviously some sort of real-world explanation for this.

674
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,253
Scott: It's not actually for reals that no it's actually is.

675
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,920
Scott: they live in some sort of magical world.

676
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,688
Scott: That's that's what Scott pilgrims about.

677
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:41,039
Scott: they let you know, it it looks a lot like the real world But it actually has video game fights in it.

678
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,365
Scott: well one kind of place.

679
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:49,360
Rym: one way to interpret all that though would be to interpret this, you know as That is the way the world is seen by the characters.

680
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:56,587
Rym: I mean look at the otaku in the van in Dora their whole thing about how they see the world and like the way the World is through their eyes.

681
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,680
Rym: You could argue the scout pilgrims the same way.

682
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,443
Rym: I mean look at us.

683
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:01,352
Rym: I think about the world in those terms.

684
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:02,960
Rym: That guy's got an 18 charisma.

685
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:07,129
Scott: The thing is I think it's got pilgrim.

686
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:10,580
Scott: it definitely story wise like I think those things do literally happen.

687
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:20,276
Scott: But that doesn't mean that they are also, you know, not a metaphor for you know Exactly and that is why utenna and big O and all these things are so good.

688
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:21,560
Scott: It's like just something litter.

689
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:27,359
Scott: It's like people think that just because like, you know, something has to not actually happen for it to be a metaphor.

690
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:30,840
Rym: somehow They're like, oh, is it a is it a cigar or it is a car?

691
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,502
Rym: Is it a cock?

692
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,331
Rym: and you know what it could be both?

693
00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:35,140
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't have to be an illusion.

694
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,586
Rym: There's cigar shaped cock.

695
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:39,640
Scott: It doesn't have to be an illusion of a cigar on top of a cock.

696
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,172
Scott: It can actually just be an actual cigar that someone actually smoked.

697
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:44,999
Scott: and it's still a metaphor for a second.

698
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:47,068
Rym: the car And this is why Scott pilgrim is.

699
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:51,146
Rym: I think it's not one of the greatest comics of all time But I would argue it's a great comic.

700
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:53,716
Rym: I'm not great in the you know, it is great sense.

701
00:37:53,776 --> 00:37:54,620
Rym: Not just oh, it was great.

702
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:56,445
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm not.

703
00:37:56,525 --> 00:38:02,040
Rym: it is self-consistent on both the direct level and the metaphorical level.

704
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:03,940
Rym: Yeah, but obviously this was intentional.

705
00:38:04,061 --> 00:38:07,720
Scott: Yeah, the other things I like about it is it's it's sort of a penny arcade situation, right?

706
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,208
Scott: You get to see Brian the O'Malley improve his skills.

707
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:11,192
Rym: Yes, Deb.

708
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:13,560
Rym: I flipped through Scott pilgrim one again, and I like it.

709
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:18,055
Rym: It's still one of my favorite volumes, but the art looks way different in six.

710
00:38:18,436 --> 00:38:20,326
Scott: Yeah compare the early penny You know, I always how.

711
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:29,120
Rym: I don't know if it was on purpose or not But at least at some point he figured out notice in the end how he showed you all the different ways He's drawn Ramona through the whole series and how he made that matter.

712
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:32,670
Rym: Yeah, I wonder if he intended that going in or if he just sucked it dry.

713
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:33,954
Scott: It doesn't matter.

714
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:35,338
Scott: You know, it was exactly.

715
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:35,840
Rym: it's clever.

716
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:37,191
Rym: So it wins exactly.

717
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:37,877
Rym: It doesn't matter.

718
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:42,300
Rym: I mean Your highness is like a golden ray.

719
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,637
Rym: Okay, I don't think anyone will get that.

720
00:38:49,657 --> 00:38:55,840
Scott: no Yeah You know, it's got pilgrim.

721
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:04,069
Scott: I mean if I had to put it on like a chart of like comics like it wouldn't be anywhere near like an Eisner Or a Tezuka or even a black said right?

722
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:07,038
Scott: It's down below all those guys, but it's above.

723
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,404
Scott: like Spider-man.

724
00:39:08,424 --> 00:39:10,474
Scott: you read every week way above that.

725
00:39:10,494 --> 00:39:11,639
Rym: It's not saying that much.

726
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:16,220
Rym: It's above a lot of the you know, what it's above a lot of the like good manga I've read.

727
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,043
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

728
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:18,287
Scott: it's like you got urasawa.

729
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:19,933
Scott: It's like one step under urasawa.

730
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:20,776
Scott: Yeah pilgrim.

731
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:21,719
Scott: It's like that's where he is.

732
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,465
Rym: I put him in the same class.

733
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:27,517
Rym: Like if urasawa is a b-plus then scout pilgrim is a.

734
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:28,400
Scott: you know, it's just as good.

735
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,113
Scott: It's equal to like yotsuba and I was among a dial.

736
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:32,700
Rym: That's that's a level of enjoyment.

737
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:35,209
Rym: Yeah, it's similar of I leave.

738
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,598
Rym: they both speak to me on the same level.

739
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:48,379
Scott: Of course yotsuba does not have the metaphor and the Right, you look at Scott pilgrim and there's some people who've actually been saying stupid shit Like Scott pilgrim is slice of life and it's like what the hell's wrong with you.

740
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:50,327
Scott: See yotsuba is slice of life, right?

741
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:59,720
Scott: You look at it and it's like yotsuba goes to the farm Yotsuba goes to the florist yotsuba rides a bicycle, you know, it's like there isn't a big story of yotsuba.

742
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:06,460
Scott: There is no, you know epic tale where she's gonna get deported back to where the you know tropical island She came from or anything like that.

743
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,246
Scott: It's just slices of life.

744
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,615
Scott: They're all totally separate and it's just here's.

745
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:11,880
Scott: they're doing this and here's a dude.

746
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,403
Scott: I was among it.

747
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,227
Scott: I was the same way.

748
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:15,760
Scott: We're in high school and we're going on vacation.

749
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:17,367
Scott: We're driving in a car.

750
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:20,540
Scott: We're fighting over a pillow, you know, it's just random life stuff.

751
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,718
Scott: It doesn't really have any over plot to it.

752
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:27,160
Scott: Scott pilgrim has moments of slice of life that are slices, you know.

753
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,280
Scott: But those moments are all to introduce you to the characters or to the plot.

754
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,932
Rym: Yes to say that this slice of life is stupid.

755
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:33,374
Rym: That's just.

756
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:34,660
Rym: that's still like make these broad.

757
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,572
Scott: We have bacon therefore everything does not suck.

758
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:41,380
Rym: that is like my third favorite moment in the entire series.

759
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,906
Scott: Right, that is a slice of life.

760
00:40:42,966 --> 00:40:43,729
Scott: is we're just chillin.

761
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,476
Scott: Well now that was bacon breakfast.

762
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:46,540
Rym: That was a slice of bacon?

763
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:48,780
Scott: Yes, it but it is a slice nonetheless.

764
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:53,116
Scott: but the there the whole book is not just slices of eating bacon.

765
00:40:53,176 --> 00:40:56,429
Scott: the whole book is Fighting seven evil eggs boyfriends.

766
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:58,399
Scott: and there's a. you know, there's actual acts with.

767
00:40:58,419 --> 00:41:02,019
Scott: you know A climax and a dental mall and you know is a story.

768
00:41:02,682 --> 00:41:08,060
Scott: Yotsuba doesn't really have that, you know, it's a anything that's a slice of life is just there's no acts.

769
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:11,519
Scott: I mean maybe each individual slice might sort of have an act.

770
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,167
Rym: It's stupid to call a slice of life.

771
00:41:13,227 --> 00:41:16,200
Rym: It kind of it removes the usefulness of the term slice of life.

772
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,987
Scott: Yeah, people are just they don't know what they're saying.

773
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:21,339
Rym: size of that life is a code for something Yotsuba or something that sucks.

774
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,359
Scott: There are slices of life that do not say there.

775
00:41:25,842 --> 00:41:30,200
Scott: Yeah, but the other thing is a lot of people get confused between like slice of life and autobiography.

776
00:41:30,483 --> 00:41:34,973
Scott: It's like look you can have an Autographical slice and autobiography isn't a slice of life.

777
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:38,283
Rym: It's the whole life chunk of life Or chunks.

778
00:41:38,303 --> 00:41:42,196
Scott: I don't know chunks of you could have a slice of like life.

779
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:43,240
Scott: that is autobiographical.

780
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:49,084
Scott: If someone just tells you slices of their life, but doesn't tell you the whole life then it is, you know there's both.

781
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:50,656
Rym: I guess it could be the whole life.

782
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:56,276
Rym: if Nothing fucking happens to the dude then why would anyone read his autobiography?

783
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:56,758
Scott: So lame?

784
00:41:56,778 --> 00:42:03,927
Rym: Yeah Ah Scott Pilger, I don't know.

785
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:05,251
Rym: I really like Kim Pine.

786
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:05,773
Rym: Kim Pine.

787
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:06,817
Scott: Everyone likes Kim Pine.

788
00:42:06,837 --> 00:42:07,600
Scott: Kim Pine is number one.

789
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:09,327
Scott: Yes, everyone else is number ten.

790
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,395
Rym: I also really like Knives Chow.

791
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:12,680
Scott: I don't really like Knives Chow.

792
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:18,105
Rym: I really like Knives Chow for a lot of reasons especially in the end.

793
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:25,260
Rym: I kind of like how the last volume like everything shifted and She kind of got her act together and I like how they had the closure in their moment.

794
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:28,679
Scott: That's one thing that I like is how every there's no one, you know.

795
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:32,796
Scott: Sometimes in the end of something it's like there's people who are still stupid, right?

796
00:42:33,238 --> 00:42:37,974
Scott: But in this Everyone is no longer stupid except Gideon, but he's not.

797
00:42:38,034 --> 00:42:39,299
Scott: he's not really stupid.

798
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:39,680
Rym: He's dead.

799
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:48,731
Scott: So yeah, I mean he's you know, he wasn't really you know, he was misguided and evil Yeah, but he wasn't you know stupid or he didn't have.

800
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:49,553
Scott: he had a shit together.

801
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:51,740
Scott: He just had a bad a bad goal.

802
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:53,698
Scott: He was you know mean and bad.

803
00:42:55,522 --> 00:42:56,788
Scott: He was a bad dude, but he wasn't.

804
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:59,000
Scott: he wasn't like a. he wasn't an incompetent bad dude.

805
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,225
Scott: He was a malicious bad dude.

806
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:00,586
Scott: He knew what he.

807
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:02,935
Scott: we know what he doing more of an Accio.

808
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:07,826
Scott: Yeah, right It's like he's not You're not like, you know sitting there going.

809
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:08,308
Scott: Oh, man.

810
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:10,976
Scott: I wish Gideon would turn good and or anything.

811
00:43:10,996 --> 00:43:19,374
Rym: You're like, oh man I wish Gideon would get the shit kicked out of it, right, but everyone else I love the scene at the end where he's like.

812
00:43:19,615 --> 00:43:20,960
Rym: were you watching me through the cat?

813
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,723
Rym: Are you the cat?

814
00:43:22,024 --> 00:43:23,871
Rym: and he's like, no, I wasn't the cat.

815
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:29,504
Rym: what you named the cat Gideon and Ronas like shut up Characters that you like.

816
00:43:29,544 --> 00:43:34,440
Scott: that were good people, but they had flaws and then they mostly all fixed themselves.

817
00:43:36,603 --> 00:43:46,400
Scott: You know when someone stays stupid It's just like you ever watch those the comedy movies like like dumb and dumber types Someone who's just so dumb and they stay dumb.

818
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:49,120
Scott: It's just like I guess when I was in like a teenager.

819
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:54,980
Scott: That was funny because it was just so poo poo poo puma, but nowadays it's like you seeing as someone's so stupid.

820
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,783
Scott: It's like oh my god.

821
00:43:56,064 --> 00:43:56,445
Scott: Oh my god.

822
00:43:56,826 --> 00:43:57,589
Scott: Stop being stupid.

823
00:43:57,629 --> 00:43:58,091
Scott: Oh my god.

824
00:43:58,111 --> 00:43:58,974
Scott: Oh my god.

825
00:43:58,994 --> 00:44:00,880
Scott: He's so stupid any Scott Pergam.

826
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,460
Scott: It's like you got these likable people that are only a little stupid.

827
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,945
Scott: So you don't have that that feeling.

828
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,250
Scott: but it's like get your shit together.

829
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,880
Rym: Well, everyone gets their their badminton moment.

830
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:09,422
Rym: That's right.

831
00:44:09,442 --> 00:44:11,047
Rym: bad badminton scene is distributed.

832
00:44:11,327 --> 00:44:13,173
Rym: I mean the the way they handle envy.

833
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:15,199
Rym: I really like her character in the end.

834
00:44:15,902 --> 00:44:20,798
Rym: Yeah, like seeing how it all turned out and that I don't know that whole scene was pretty cool in the club.

835
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:22,002
Rym: cuz I like How everyone else.

836
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,528
Scott: just the club was pretty much that was.

837
00:44:23,568 --> 00:44:24,090
Scott: that was it.

838
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,479
Scott: Yeah, it's like everybody up in the club.

839
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:29,193
Scott: Yes Awesome, even Wallace is up in the club.

840
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,360
Rym: course Wallace was up in the club.

841
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,323
Rym: Well, this is a man.

842
00:44:31,383 --> 00:44:33,008
Scott: Wallace is probably number two after Kim pine.

843
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:33,209
Scott: Yeah.

844
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:35,155
Scott: Well, it's like she's way down.

845
00:44:35,677 --> 00:44:39,060
Rym: She's like number three hundred.

846
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:40,483
Rym: She's down.

847
00:44:40,503 --> 00:44:41,045
Rym: She's up there.

848
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:42,392
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

849
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:43,658
Scott: I don't know why your knives chuffing.

850
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:44,140
Rym: I don't know.

851
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,702
Rym: I just I am.

852
00:44:45,003 --> 00:44:45,666
Scott: I'm a fan of.

853
00:44:45,967 --> 00:44:48,737
Scott: I mean, I'll take I'll take frickin like young meal over knives chow.

854
00:44:48,758 --> 00:44:49,320
Scott: Really?

855
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,616
Rym: Yeah, I think my order would be it'd be a race.

856
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:56,510
Scott: Why are we like ranking the characters?

857
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,220
Scott: because we don't do that for like other stuff, right?

858
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,132
Rym: We did for shows we really really liked in the past.

859
00:45:02,473 --> 00:45:03,056
Rym: I can do ten.

860
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,020
Rym: Oh, we did the same shit.

861
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,479
Rym: I think it's just that a toga was fucking show.

862
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:12,400
Scott: Show really is about this cast of characters and there's so many supporting characters and they're all awesome.

863
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:17,780
Scott: So it's like you're just so you end up caring about some of these supporting characters because they're so good.

864
00:45:18,021 --> 00:45:42,899
Rym: I think part of the reason we care about him too is that while a lot of them are kind of one-dimensional or they're not super characterized their interactions with each other and with Scott and with the other and with the other characters like the main characters We're very realistic in terms of that world like take their conversations and replace the proper nouns with your own groups inside joke proper nouns and that's Exactly how the front row crew interacts most of the time.

865
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:43,943
Scott: Yeah, I mean.

866
00:45:43,984 --> 00:45:48,519
Scott: and the other thing is you look at Scott Pilgrim himself and it's like what does he really?

867
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,740
Scott: Do so much, you know, it's like a lot of times.

868
00:45:52,922 --> 00:45:59,070
Scott: He's just basically You know like the bouncing off Target for every supporting character cuz he hadn't found his own.

869
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,800
Rym: all the other characters had found their own or seeking their own.

870
00:46:02,181 --> 00:46:03,747
Rym: He was not seeking or so.

871
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:10,933
Scott: It's like you're really looking at all these supporting people, you know Scott pilgrim is the one who's always got the camera on and most of the time.

872
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:22,220
Scott: but you're really looking at all these supporting characters Bouncing off of him constantly, you know What you end up caring about them a lot because they are like, you know The the plot arcs are them and you know Nana did that too.

873
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:27,960
Rym: We liked both Nana's and if time went on one Nana never fucking did anything and the other Nana was doing stuff.

874
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:33,460
Rym: So eventually you're kind of like watching all these characters and you're kind of leaving the one character behind.

875
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:41,565
Rym: Scott pilgrim had to come of age and you know all the metaphors that are obvious and Scott pilgrim Yes, many obvious things.

876
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,937
Scott: Yeah, it's I guess that's one negative thing you could say about it is it's not really subtle.

877
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:48,666
Scott: It's so it's just obvious.

878
00:46:48,727 --> 00:46:50,453
Rym: but it's it's while it's not subtle.

879
00:46:50,714 --> 00:46:51,075
Rym: It doesn't.

880
00:46:51,115 --> 00:46:52,420
Rym: it isn't just coming of age.

881
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:58,880
Rym: it really gets into the nature of Relationships in that not for everybody not every culture goes through this.

882
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:04,878
Rym: I think many people in the previous generation never had the same kind of scope of life, especially in the 20s to 30s.

883
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,705
Rym: I mean look at all these people.

884
00:47:06,725 --> 00:47:25,868
Rym: they're a lot like us, you know, you have your awesome life or you're kicking ass You're the high school, you know nerd running around and then you get to college you live this nerd life in college and then you're in the real world and You still have like like your last set of relationships were the college nerd life And you haven't moved on to anything past that.

885
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:30,964
Rym: and I think a lot of people have had relationships that went Very similarly.

886
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:33,820
Rym: I mean a lot of people have the issue of I like every girl.

887
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:37,295
Rym: I mean that was Gideon's problem in the end He liked every girl and he never gave up on any one of them.

888
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:37,738
Rym: and you know what?

889
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,109
Rym: Scott pilgrim had the same problem.

890
00:47:40,753 --> 00:47:44,371
Scott: Yep, exactly Straight up except Scott program had a much.

891
00:47:44,813 --> 00:47:48,074
Scott: Well, not that difficult the time I mean, he just walked out to Ramona's like hey want to go.

892
00:47:48,095 --> 00:47:54,800
Rym: I was like, okay Yeah But even then he's still like he had feelings for all these other people and there was no closure with any of those people.

893
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,184
Rym: That's the dangerous combination.

894
00:47:56,525 --> 00:48:05,603
Rym: He had no closure with with people like knives or envy or even Kim and Simultaneously, he had no closure with his current relationship Mm-hmm.

895
00:48:05,764 --> 00:48:08,640
Rym: Nothing was done and everything was a loose thread.

896
00:48:09,121 --> 00:48:11,167
Rym: Gideon wanted every thread to be his forever.

897
00:48:11,427 --> 00:48:13,413
Rym: Scott pilgrim tied all the threads up.

898
00:48:14,195 --> 00:48:15,078
Rym: Yep, and totally made.

899
00:48:15,178 --> 00:48:18,350
Rym: actually May notice how he made out with almost everyone.

900
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,120
Scott: Yeah, that's that's why he's awesome.

901
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:21,066
Rym: Yeah, that's.

902
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:22,596
Rym: I think that's a good way to get closure.

903
00:48:22,656 --> 00:48:26,813
Scott: to be honest You know, you didn't actually see Gideon actually making out with that with anybody.

904
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:33,749
Rym: really no, but you know, yeah He was kind of a dick we got anything else to.

905
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,660
Scott: uh, oh one other thing is a lot of people, right?

906
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,416
Scott: They got to shut up as they're like, oh man, this comic is about these hipsters.

907
00:48:40,456 --> 00:48:42,084
Scott: Look these kids They're not hipsters.

908
00:48:42,405 --> 00:48:43,370
Scott: These are not hipsters.

909
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:44,836
Scott: You do not know if you think that this is.

910
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:45,600
Scott: those are hipsters.

911
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:48,865
Rym: Those are Basically very.

912
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:49,988
Rym: they're in the same like.

913
00:48:50,008 --> 00:48:56,688
Rym: they're on the Venn diagram with like the front row crew and like you listeners that is like Nerd 20 to 30 something.

914
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:58,714
Scott: Yeah, they're not hipsters.

915
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:06,020
Scott: if you don't know what hipsters are Go to like, you know, Google image search and look for hipster and there's a no just go to Park Slope.

916
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:11,267
Scott: No Park Slope has got lots of Jews Also a lot of hipster rich people.

917
00:49:11,287 --> 00:49:13,735
Rym: All right cross the Williamsburg Bridge.

918
00:49:14,016 --> 00:49:17,365
Rym: Yeah, you'll see on a Friday Saturday.

919
00:49:17,445 --> 00:49:19,130
Scott: Yeah, I mean the thing is.

920
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:22,000
Scott: the problem I think is this term hipster is being thrown around a lot.

921
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,095
Scott: But a lot of people they don't you know hipsters live in cities.

922
00:49:25,135 --> 00:49:26,100
Scott: They don't really live anywhere else.

923
00:49:26,521 --> 00:49:34,012
Scott: so a lot of people who don't most people don't ever actually see hipsters ever and So they don't even know what hipster means.

924
00:49:34,032 --> 00:49:35,220
Scott: because you don't really see hipsters.

925
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:39,596
Scott: I guess like, you know in popular culture, you know, like movies all that much.

926
00:49:39,636 --> 00:49:40,820
Scott: What's a movie with hipsters in it?

927
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,130
Rym: There's a ton of hipster movies, but they're all.

928
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,074
Scott: yeah, you don't see them in.

929
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:47,677
Scott: like, you know major movies Really, you know that are in the movie theater.

930
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,025
Scott: Inception didn't have any hipsters in it.

931
00:49:50,146 --> 00:49:53,640
Scott: No, it didn't, you know, so it's like, you know, Scott Pilgrim doesn't have any in it.

932
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,311
Scott: So it's people don't really know what hipster is.

933
00:49:56,331 --> 00:49:58,620
Scott: They just start calling hipsters to something.

934
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,257
Scott: They see that they think oh that must be hipster.

935
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,286
Rym: All right I mean basically the characters in Scott Pilgrim.

936
00:50:02,327 --> 00:50:05,819
Rym: I'd qualify them as nerd or geek kind of hip not hip stir.

937
00:50:06,343 --> 00:50:08,259
Scott: It is cuz someone's hip doesn't make you a hip stir.

938
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,786
Scott: Yeah, a hip stir.

939
00:50:09,826 --> 00:50:14,786
Scott: wears tight-ass jeans rides a bicycle That's you know got no brakes on it.

940
00:50:14,826 --> 00:50:17,616
Rym: drinks the pabs blue ribbon drinks a paps blue ribbon.

941
00:50:17,977 --> 00:50:18,920
Rym: works a job.

942
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,111
Rym: That's dead end, but they don't care.

943
00:50:20,131 --> 00:50:23,680
Rym: because they make enough money They want or they are their trust fund.

944
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,456
Scott: They got a trust fund and they sit around like playing, you know video poker and you know what also.

945
00:50:28,918 --> 00:50:29,640
Rym: this is an aside.

946
00:50:30,005 --> 00:50:31,100
Rym: There's nothing wrong with hipsters.

947
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:38,530
Rym: I think the reason people are so threatened by hipsters and I see like talking to co-workers and people I get I figured it out They see a hipster.

948
00:50:38,832 --> 00:50:39,578
Rym: forget the trust fund.

949
00:50:39,598 --> 00:50:44,119
Rym: hipsters An actual hipster actual normal non trust fund hipster.

950
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,593
Rym: All right, they have decided to issue some long-term corporate career.

951
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:50,760
Rym: They're working at like Starbucks.

952
00:50:51,763 --> 00:50:54,159
Rym: All right, they're making enough money for rent and fun.

953
00:50:54,461 --> 00:50:57,979
Rym: They got like five roommates and they've decided rent and fun is gonna be their whole life.

954
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,892
Rym: Mmm, is there anything wrong with that?

955
00:51:00,972 --> 00:51:02,600
Rym: Anyone who hates that is jealous of that?

956
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,933
Scott: Well, I think the thing is the vast majority of them are the trust fund kind.

957
00:51:05,993 --> 00:51:06,857
Scott: There's almost none.

958
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:08,946
Rym: that are the No, I think there's.

959
00:51:09,227 --> 00:51:14,253
Scott: I think it's about 50/50 I think I think you I think you are greatly Underestimating the number of people with trust funds.

960
00:51:14,334 --> 00:51:22,260
Scott: I've seen multiple Companies is actually a hot market of making things to help parents manage the trust funds because there are lots of them.

961
00:51:22,461 --> 00:51:23,908
Rym: No, so I think here's what's going on.

962
00:51:23,988 --> 00:51:26,400
Rym: I still think the majority of hipsters are non trust fund directly.

963
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:36,256
Rym: However, I think every like core of hipsters like six hipsters living in one apartment I think one of them is the nucleus with the trust fund and the others are sponges.

964
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:37,702
Scott: Oh, you're greatly I like.

965
00:51:37,823 --> 00:51:39,491
Scott: I know for a fact that they like.

966
00:51:39,511 --> 00:51:43,246
Scott: the number of trust funds is Number of hipsters.

967
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:45,314
Rym: There's so many I think they really are.

968
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:46,860
Scott: No, it's that's what I'm saying.

969
00:51:48,423 --> 00:51:49,250
Scott: It's pretty close.

970
00:51:49,432 --> 00:51:50,911
Scott: a lot of these kids They're just.

971
00:51:51,053 --> 00:51:56,257
Scott: you know Even if they don't have a trust fund they see their parents pay their rent and then all their stuff they.

972
00:51:56,598 --> 00:51:59,100
Scott: so they just bum Around but they don't live with their parents.

973
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,088
Rym: So even with the trust fund what's better?

974
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:08,700
Rym: the guy whose parents pays for him who lives the hipster life Or the guy who parents pay for him who eats bologna and white bread and plays video?

975
00:52:09,302 --> 00:52:10,749
Scott: Those are both, you know bad.

976
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,638
Scott: Yeah, you should have your own monies.

977
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:13,000
Scott: Why?

978
00:52:13,801 --> 00:52:14,879
Rym: I've got free money forever.

979
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:17,304
Scott: Because now you're.

980
00:52:17,424 --> 00:52:18,428
Scott: you don't have your shit together.

981
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:19,051
Scott: who cares?

982
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:21,320
Scott: you're like Scott pilgrim and kick your ass.

983
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:25,840
Rym: What if I've got my shit together on every other facet of my life except money and money's coming in forever?

984
00:52:26,924 --> 00:52:27,491
Scott: You suck.

985
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:30,076
Rym: Yeah Because you want that.

986
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:35,520
Rym: no What if you won the lottery and you won that like $50,000 a year for life, I would do something with it.

987
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:44,960
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't sit around playing video poker and drinking paps loo ribbon all day No, but I'd sit around playing counter-strike and drinking chamois all day.

988
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:46,286
Scott: I wouldn't you wait?

989
00:52:46,306 --> 00:52:48,555
Rym: that was me a waste and also podcast a lot.

990
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:49,660
Scott: Yeah, that's doing something.

991
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:51,266
Scott: Anyway, hipsters don't do anything.

992
00:52:51,607 --> 00:52:52,270
Rym: Sometimes they do.

993
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,197
Rym: they go to bars and they talk about me.

994
00:52:54,217 --> 00:52:58,267
Rym: Maybe they're in a band I like in the end.

995
00:52:58,368 --> 00:53:00,260
Rym: how now Scott pilgrims band sucks?

996
00:53:00,901 --> 00:53:03,309
Rym: Yeah, that really like that was the coming-of-age.

997
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:05,617
Rym: my band sucks and I don't care.

998
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:10,453
Scott: Mm-hmm You know, I don't think sex bomb was actually supposed to be that good either.

999
00:53:10,513 --> 00:53:12,340
Rym: No, they were powerful but not good.

1000
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,820
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't like they were you know, touring the the country or anything.

1001
00:53:16,342 --> 00:53:17,887
Rym: I think one thing I want to touch on.

1002
00:53:17,907 --> 00:53:19,232
Rym: we've talked about this a couple of times.

1003
00:53:19,734 --> 00:53:30,056
Rym: a lot of people have a very specific complaint about Scott pilgrim and the complaint they always make is The video game like they liked like most of us who like Emily's parents everyone like.

1004
00:53:30,177 --> 00:53:36,819
Rym: maybe they get the references Maybe they don't but they like the core message the story the metaphor the world all that stuff.

1005
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:56,080
Rym: But I think a lot of people who were disappointed with the ending In fact, I think most people who are disappointed with the ending Didn't get the core message or didn't have the kind of life to where they would Understand on a personal level the core message and as a result Their primary enjoyment was the fight scenes and the humor and the video game references.

1006
00:53:56,462 --> 00:53:59,720
Scott: There's a lot of people who enjoy it on that level and the people who enjoyed on that level.

1007
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:02,552
Rym: I can see why they would be very unsatisfied with the ending.

1008
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:06,023
Rym: They're like the end wasn't epic enough and That's bullshit.

1009
00:54:06,063 --> 00:54:08,492
Rym: The ending was basically perfect.

1010
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:10,660
Scott: Well, I mean, what other ending could you really have?

1011
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,412
Scott: I mean, that's the best ending you could have.

1012
00:54:12,432 --> 00:54:12,855
Scott: but they're like.

1013
00:54:12,895 --> 00:54:15,809
Rym: I wanted a big Wanted more video games thing.

1014
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:16,673
Scott: It was a big fight.

1015
00:54:16,773 --> 00:54:18,100
Rym: They wanted a bigger fight and they want.

1016
00:54:19,341 --> 00:54:21,490
Rym: They basically didn't care about the metaphor.

1017
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:22,314
Scott: I got a one-up.

1018
00:54:22,354 --> 00:54:23,680
Scott: how much more video game do you want?

1019
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,220
Rym: They wanted more video game shit, and they didn't get the core messy.

1020
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:27,766
Scott: I think that's.

1021
00:54:27,787 --> 00:54:31,500
Scott: the other thing is that you know You don't see having video game shit like that too often.

1022
00:54:31,761 --> 00:54:34,456
Scott: There really isn't that much of it and it says a lot of it.

1023
00:54:34,496 --> 00:54:34,818
Scott: like in.

1024
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:41,528
Scott: you know Volume one but a lot is like two or three half the people who make this like a pretty ransom coin and a skateboard And one up and I did.

1025
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:43,040
Scott: there's like three things.

1026
00:54:43,204 --> 00:54:48,899
Rym: I Defy most of the people who have complained about the end of Scott Pilgrim from even knowing what clash at demon head is.

1027
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:50,264
Scott: Yeah, right.

1028
00:54:50,305 --> 00:54:51,209
Scott: So that's like, okay.

1029
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:53,720
Scott: So there are three video game things in a whole volume.

1030
00:54:53,801 --> 00:54:57,525
Scott: There's not a lot of video game stuff going on It's just a little bit.

1031
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:01,558
Scott: but somehow people like, you know inflated to think like oh, there's so much of it.

1032
00:55:01,578 --> 00:55:03,739
Scott: Holy crap It's just all about video game references.

1033
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,288
Rym: I do I think my favorite moment aren't that many.

1034
00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:13,453
Rym: my favorite moment in the entire thing other than the cat thing at the end Was well now the bunch of room coming to my head.

1035
00:55:13,735 --> 00:55:15,100
Rym: Oh, no, I could just talk about it forever.

1036
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,084
Rym: We'll do the movies.

1037
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,554
Rym: You should see thing where we just say all the things we liked and quote it.

1038
00:55:18,574 --> 00:55:22,272
Rym: Mm-hmm I actually forgot what is very good now.

1039
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:23,740
Rym: bacon was good, but it wasn't great.

1040
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,142
Rym: It was when knives chow.

1041
00:55:25,443 --> 00:55:35,074
Rym: her moment of closure with Scott Pilgrim was you will always be my clash at demon head Because that is such the perfect line.

1042
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:44,339
Rym: think about it the nostalgic First video game or memory of something that if you actually went back and played it for real is a piece of shit.

1043
00:55:46,462 --> 00:55:49,451
Rym: But at the same time it was important to your development as a person.

1044
00:55:49,993 --> 00:55:53,684
Rym: the memory of it is important to you and That's it.

1045
00:55:53,965 --> 00:55:57,646
Rym: playing a game like clash at demon head Is?

1046
00:55:57,768 --> 00:55:58,818
Rym: you don't want to play that now?

1047
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,405
Scott: But you don't watch him in there.

1048
00:56:00,485 --> 00:56:08,960
Rym: your memory of playing it and your memory of watching it are very important and they shaped you As a person, yep, I had a lot of Master the Universe figures and when I see them I still go.

1049
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:13,757
Rym: I played a lot of really shitty NES and Atari games to the point of being scarily good at them.

1050
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:16,139
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I wouldn't want to play him now.

1051
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:23,681
Scott: No Like if I break out the NES emulator like there's some games in there that I can play like Kirby's adventure or Super Mario 3.

1052
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:24,303
Rym: You're not playing.

1053
00:56:24,344 --> 00:56:25,488
Rym: no Bunga's ambition.

1054
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,055
Scott: Well, I mean that's a difference.

1055
00:56:27,115 --> 00:56:28,200
Scott: That's a different category.

1056
00:56:29,243 --> 00:56:34,159
Scott: You know Megaman's I can play but Megaman one Metroid you can play Megaman one.

1057
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:45,868
Scott: Yeah But there are a lot of unplayable games like, you know Cheetah, man You know, what's fitting?

1058
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:47,440
Scott: I like Kung Fu Heroes, right?

1059
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,300
Scott: I played that game when I was a kid and I played it quite a bit, but it's pretty much unplayable now.

1060
00:56:51,461 --> 00:56:55,459
Scott: I mean, it's not totally broken as like the Cheetah men level, but it's pretty bad.

1061
00:56:56,323 --> 00:57:00,079
Scott: You know and it's it's but I have fond memories of it, but I can't really play now.

1062
00:57:00,662 --> 00:57:03,393
Rym: So I'm really looking forward to the movie like.

1063
00:57:03,774 --> 00:57:08,712
Rym: I'm looking forward to this movie Almost as much as I was looking forward to like NS2.

1064
00:57:08,752 --> 00:57:10,540
Scott: I'm not looking forward to that much.

1065
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,556
Rym: I'm more like not as much as I was looking forward to Team Fortress 2 you.

1066
00:57:13,637 --> 00:57:16,109
Scott: the only movie I'm still looking forward to is Tron.

1067
00:57:16,249 --> 00:57:18,419
Scott: I put all my eggs in one basket Tron.

1068
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:24,600
Rym: I'm looking forward to Tron, but I don't expect it to be better than Tron.

1069
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,008
Scott: Well much like clash at demon head right Tron.

1070
00:57:27,048 --> 00:57:29,997
Scott: the story of the original Tron movies is there really?

1071
00:57:30,037 --> 00:57:31,383
Rym: there's something that bothers me About Tron.

1072
00:57:31,746 --> 00:57:33,680
Rym: So the arcade guy was complaining.

1073
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:43,171
Rym: He's basically like I made that game and that jerk stole it and now the kids are putting all their money Into his game in my arcade.

1074
00:57:43,815 --> 00:57:44,780
Rym: It's his arcade.

1075
00:57:45,688 --> 00:57:46,878
Rym: He's the one making the money.

1076
00:57:48,002 --> 00:57:49,189
Scott: What the fuck.

1077
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,940
Scott: the story of Tron is really dumb.

1078
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:52,265
Scott: It doesn't hold up at all.

1079
00:57:52,285 --> 00:57:53,450
Rym: It doesn't make any sense.

1080
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,000
Scott: These special effects don't really hold up that much.

1081
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:57,263
Rym: No They do.

1082
00:57:57,343 --> 00:57:58,868
Scott: they were revolutionary at the time.

1083
00:57:58,888 --> 00:58:01,678
Rym: They hold up in the same way that the daikon animation holds up.

1084
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:08,607
Rym: You watch it And if you understand what it is, it is awe Inspiring to see that what they pulled off.

1085
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:12,620
Scott: Yes, but the thing with Tron right is I don't expect the plot.

1086
00:58:12,881 --> 00:58:15,012
Scott: I mean, there's a new trailer out that shows you some of the plot.

1087
00:58:15,393 --> 00:58:19,366
Rym: It's a basically what I expect Some fucking light cycles.

1088
00:58:19,426 --> 00:58:26,681
Scott: Yeah, it's a generic and black plot, you know, it's probably not gonna be something That's like oh my gosh It might have a twist ending or something like that But big deal.

1089
00:58:27,223 --> 00:58:35,090
Scott: the reason that I'm holding all the eggs in the basket for Tron right is because a Daft Punk music B 3d IMAX.

1090
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:43,482
Rym: holy shit This scout pilgrim man, wouldn't it be awesome if they got like on him on a Gucci to do the music for the game Tron Man.

1091
00:58:43,543 --> 00:58:46,495
Rym: what if they got like Daft Punk to do the music for Tron?

1092
00:58:46,555 --> 00:58:46,876
Rym: they did.

1093
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:53,677
Scott: and Right fucking if I could go into any sort of world, you know that I would live in the Tron world.

1094
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:54,720
Rym: really Tron world.

1095
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:03,748
Scott: Yes, if there's any fictional world that I if they're not forgotten I would not pick Forgotten Realms You might you might be a peasant.

1096
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:04,772
Rym: What about Inception?

1097
00:59:05,395 --> 00:59:06,700
Rym: No, yo dog.

1098
00:59:07,132 --> 00:59:12,712
Rym: Yeah Of all the fictional old matrix if you're neo no, why not?

1099
00:59:12,812 --> 00:59:15,360
Scott: No, I would rather be in Tron world.

1100
00:59:15,982 --> 00:59:18,873
Rym: What if Tron is just the first the alpha version of the matrix?

1101
00:59:19,335 --> 00:59:20,399
Scott: I've been Tron world.

1102
00:59:21,242 --> 00:59:24,854
Scott: Tron world is the world to be in disc throwing by Scott Yahtzee.

1103
00:59:25,235 --> 00:59:26,760
Scott: Plus didn't you see in the trailer?

1104
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,545
Scott: There's a new.

1105
00:59:27,928 --> 00:59:29,560
Scott: it looks like there's a new flying thing.

1106
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,971
Scott: So it's like you might be a third Tron sport.

1107
00:59:33,092 --> 00:59:35,139
Rym: I kind of want to play some ricochet.

1108
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:37,306
Scott: suddenly I want to play ricochet all the time.

1109
00:59:37,326 --> 00:59:38,992
Scott: That's why I want to go to Tron world.

00:59:39,112 --> 00:59:43,520
Rym: I Also think that light water tasted really freakin good.

Rym: when we do like burning wheels sells so much when we talk about it.

1132
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:34,994
Scott: I can advertise anything that is legitimately I believe in.

1133
01:00:35,074 --> 01:00:37,326
Scott: if I don't believe in it and it sucks I can't advertise.

1134
01:00:37,366 --> 01:00:42,970
Rym: so maybe our system should be you give us ten grand We review your thing privately and then we review it.

1135
01:00:43,151 --> 01:00:47,206
Rym: Honestly if you if it's good No, we review it.

1136

Scott: Otherwise, your ten grand is on the whole.

1137
01:00:48,835 --> 01:00:52,364
Rym: we review it honestly 100%.

1138
01:00:52,364 --> 01:00:58,227
Scott: someone's gonna be pretty pissed off though if they passed, you know money to Advertise and we say we basically say they suck.

1139
01:00:58,268 --> 01:01:01,560
Rym: so we review it honestly and we say here's what we said.

1140
01:01:02,021 --> 01:01:03,266
Rym: Do you want us to put it up?

1141
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:06,759
Rym: Yeah, you paid either way, but we'll we'll just swallow it.

1142
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:08,718
Rym: the ten grand.

1143
01:01:10,122 --> 01:01:10,948
Scott: They'll be pretty pissed.

1144
01:01:11,029 --> 01:01:14,260
Scott: if they pay you money They expect you to say what they want you to say.

1145
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:19,659
Rym: I want to say the people who make it through the barrier like they I think those guys I'll talk about it.

01:01:28,862 --> 01:01:30,808
Scott: We don't do advertisements on GeekNights has to be on.

1150
01:01:30,848 --> 01:01:37,294
Scott: something else would be an advertisement, okay a Paid review is an advertisement not if I'm honest.

1151
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,123
Scott: I Think it is so.
