1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,264
Rym: Well, it's time.

2
00:00:01,746 --> 00:00:02,268
Rym: It's over.

3
00:00:02,328 --> 00:00:06,000
Rym: Tonight, at least for now, is the last night of Questions Week.

4
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:07,990
Scott: Oh, good, because I'm so sleepy.

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,379
Scott: Oh, I got to sleep.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,860
Rym: But how could that- I gotta say, doing Questions Week is a lot easier than doing the normal show.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,499
Rym: I mean, no news, no things of the day- I'm not sleepy because of Questions Week.

8
00:00:18,803 --> 00:00:20,140
Rym: What the hell do you have to be sleepy for?

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,900
Rym: I'm the one who got up at frickin' 4.30 in the morning this morning and took a train into the city.

10
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:27,340
Rym: Was three hours late to work, but no one noticed.

11
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:32,479
Scott: Well, it's mostly- it's sort of like I get tired when I don't do things, you know?

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,096
Scott: So I sat at work today, and I didn't do much work, and I was just kind of *snores*.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,140
Rym: So now you're gonna stay home all weekend not doing anything, thus falling into a catechet.

14
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:43,733
Scott: No, I'm gonna do stuff this weekend.

15
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:44,319
Scott: I got plans.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,409
Rym: Alright, so you're gonna- what are you gonna do?

17
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,420
Rym: You gonna find some matching shoes for that sundress?

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,807
Rym: What's the deal, God?

19
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:51,520
Scott: You give it up for it, it's not funny.

20
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:52,620
Rym: I think it's hilarious.

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,800
Scott: No, it's just kind of eh, and lame.

22
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:57,760
Rym: Anyway, you know the drill, we're not even gonna bother.

23
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,715
Rym: Just listen to the rest of this week, so Thursday, October 17th.

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,620
Scott: Yeah, you're Thursday-only listeners, you should be listening to the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday episodes this week.

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,298
Rym: Just this week.

26
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,816
Scott: Oh, no, you should listen to them always, but- Monday, October 15th through Thursday, October 18th.

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:22,200
Rym: We're answering your questions, we're not saying names, yada yada yada, no research, didn't even read the questions, we don't have any internet in front of us to answer anything, we're just kind of playing it by the wire.

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,498
Scott: There's like a billion questions here.

29
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:36,760
Rym: Yeah, and also, we'll just say that, like the other three days, we have, and actually for this, I think we have three days worth of questions, so there will be episodes in the future that will answer many more questions.

30
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:38,016
Rym: Alright.

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,920
Rym: Without further ado, have you ever been violent with each other?

32
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,809
Scott: Seriously violent?

33
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:45,879
Scott: I don't think so.

34
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:58,640
Rym: Nah, I think once or twice we punch each other in the arm, but even then, it wasn't- I think there were quite a few tickle wars, that's all you're getting.

35
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:05,560
Rym: Yeah, yeah, maybe we'll talk about that in the future, because it wasn't just Scott and myself involved in that unfortunate situation.

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,720
Scott: Oh, the second question lets us do an opening bit.

37
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:11,980
Rym: Oh, not bad, because something happened today.

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:20,548
Scott: Yeah, see, a lot of things have been happening in the news, there have been a lot of things of the day, there have been a lot of things happening in our lives, and we haven't been able to talk about them because of questions week, but you know what?

39
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:21,298
Scott: Here we go!

40
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:25,200
Scott: What companies do you work for currently, and do you change often?

41
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:27,520
Rym: Well, I guess you can go first here.

42
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:43,820
Scott: I was working for some company, and now I'm working for a different company, and I, let's see, I got out of college, I was working when I was in college, you know, different places, and then as I got out of college, I got the job, and I worked there for a couple years, I think, maybe?

43
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,160
Scott: You know, I don't even remember.

44
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:49,456
Scott: And now I work where I'm at now, and I've been here less than a year, so yeah.

45
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,420
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I pretty much right out of, well, my first job ever, ever, ever was the federal government.

46
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,758
Scott: Yeah, I'm not going back that far.

47
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:12,596
Rym: Because I never worked in high school, I never had a job until I graduated high school, and I never really had a real job until, you know, I was at RIT, and I had to do a co-op to graduate, and IBM was all, "Hey, Rym, well, Brandon, you want to work for

48
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:12,838
Rym: IBM?".

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,716
Rym: And I was like, "No, I don't want to do

50
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,140
Rym: databases.".

51
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:18,233
Rym: And they were like, "Don't worry, we'll keep your resume on file, in case someone else is

52
00:03:18,254 --> 00:03:18,580
Rym: interested.".

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,657
Rym: I was like, "Yeah, right, you're not going to keep my resume on

54
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:20,980
Rym: file.".

55
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:28,038
Rym: And then like two days later, some other IBM manager called and was like, "Hey, so-and-so gave me your resume, you want to do networking for us

56
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:28,420
Rym: instead?".

57
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,257
Rym: And I was like, "Oh, yeah,

58
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:30,520
Rym: sure.".

59
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:37,649
Rym: So I worked at IBM for like three years, and I took my last online class to actually get my degree from RIT.

60
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:40,300
Rym: that I kind of skipped out on getting for a little while.

61
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:42,460
Rym: And then I quit.

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,820
Rym: I worked at this other company with hospitals in the Bronx until, well, today.

63
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,083
Rym: Oh.

64
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:54,178
Rym: I was idly looking for another job, just kind of like poking around Craigslist, like, "Whatever, let's see what's out

65
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:54,300
Rym: there.".

66
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,680
Scott: That's the best way to find a new job, is just stop doing work at your current job, and start going on Craigslist instead, until eventually.

67
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,880
Rym: Or even keep doing work.

68
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:03,480
Rym: The thing is, just put your resume on Craigslist.

69
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:05,239
Rym: If you're competent, they will come.

70
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:14,854
Rym: And I'm not going to get into the details at all, but I'm going to start work probably on Guy Fawkes Day for a new company that has given me a 40% raise over my current work.

71
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:21,800
Rym: So the combined income of myself, Scott, and Emily is kind of sick.

72
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:22,760
Rym: All right.

73
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:25,219
Rym: I got a lot of freaking money, and I don't know what to do.

74
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:25,772
Scott: Okay.

75
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:30,020
Scott: What are our favorite five current ongoing podcasts?

76
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,480
Rym: Pseudopod and Escape Pod, which I'm going to count as one.

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,600
Rym: 12 Byzantine Emperors, because it's not over yet.

78
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,299
Rym: Dave and Joel's Fast Karate for the Gentlemen.

79
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,820
Rym: NPR's It's All Politics.

80
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:41,956
Rym: And, uh, I'm not going to say that.

81
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:44,820
Scott: Something else.

82
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,057
Scott: Dave and Joel.

83
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:46,917
Rym: All right.

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,419
Rym: Movies You Should Say, which I still, I love that podcast.

85
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,172
Scott: Let's see.

86
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,818
Scott: ESPN PTI, Dave and Joel.

87
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:58,039
Scott: Derek the Bandit.

88
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:00,916
Rym: Come on.

89
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,720
Rym: Snap, snap, snap.

90
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,218
Rym: Puff, puff, puff.

91
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,674
Rym: Go, go, go.

92
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:04,440
Scott: GeekNights.

93
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,420
Scott: And because I listen to more, but they're not, I wouldn't call them like my favorite.

94
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,779
Rym: You know what?

95
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,280
Rym: You know, while you might say saying GeekNights is such a cop-out, but you know what?

96
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,540
Rym: And this is going to sound really dumb, but I kind of listen to GeekNights now.

97
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:17,419
Rym: And I used to not.

98
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,840
Scott: Yeah, I don't listen to it all the time, but I do like listening.

99
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,639
Scott: The Roadhouse.

100
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:22,990
Scott: Sure.

101
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:31,140
Rym: I guess if you're looking for more podcasts, you probably would like the podcast that we like if you like our podcast.

102
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,718
Scott: But then again, you don't want to ask us because we don't really change what podcast you listen to very often.

103
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:36,319
Rym: Oh, I try.

104
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:40,390
Rym: You should see the list of Geek Facts.

105
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:44,679
Rym: I've got ready to go for all the shit podcasts I tried to listen to in the past year.

106
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:46,519
Rym: Right, right.

107
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,700
Rym: So, hey, Rym and Scott, I have a simple question for Rym.

108
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,740
Rym: As far as I can tell, his name is Brandon.

109
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,780
Rym: They're far, spelled wrong.

110
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,479
Rym: They're far.

111
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,379
Rym: Why do you call yourself Rym?

112
00:05:58,922 --> 00:05:59,799
Scott: Did we talk about this?

113
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:07,760
Rym: I've answered this on the show, like, four times, and there are two separate forum threads that give the exact answer in kind of excruciating detail.

114
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,760
Scott: So we're not going to answer it now.

115
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,219
Scott: Let's move on.

116
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,620
Rym: I'll just say this, Bob.

117
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,994
Rym: Think of it as a pen name.

118
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,540
Rym: It's just my stage name, except it's also my name in real life.

119
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:16,320
Scott: Like Sting.

120
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:22,998
Rym: Yeah, I'm one of those people who had the balls to say, all right, guys, call me Sting, except it worked.

121
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,000
Scott: Well, the reason it worked in my case, because I didn't even know you were Brandon.

122
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,980
Scott: I thought that was your real name.

123
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,120
Rym: Well, you know what part of that?

124
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:29,039
Scott: What's that guy's name?

125
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:30,557
Rym: You know what part of that was?

126
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:32,920
Rym: All my friends in high school called me Rym.

127
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,338
Rym: And the only people who didn't call me Rym were people who didn't actually like people who weren't actually friends with me.

128
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:38,752
Scott: Yep.

129
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:39,680
Scott: Okay.

130
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,040
Scott: What do you think of Monty Python and what are your favorite sketches?

131
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,660
Scott: Monty Python is awesome.

132
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,480
Rym: Oh, this will be yours.

133
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:45,977
Rym: What the cut?

134
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:47,279
Rym: No, not the cotton's, lad.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,639
Scott: No, I like Silly Walks.

136
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:50,737
Rym: I don't know.

137
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:53,620
Scott: I like the joke that when you read it, you die.

138
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:54,819
Rym: That one's okay.

139
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,740
Rym: I think my favorite sketch of all time.

140
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,277
Scott: Dennis Moore, Dennis Moore, dum, dum, dum.

141
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,813
Rym: Actually, now you might think the parrot sketch is an excellent sketch.

142
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:15,699
Rym: However, there is another sketch that takes the exact same concept, but it's a used car lot instead, but it's still John Cleese.

143
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:17,278
Rym: I recall playing the straight man.

144
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,119
Scott: Sam Prini.

145
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:24,440
Rym: I think my favorite Monty Python sketch of all time has to be Salad Days.

146
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:26,057
Scott: Salad Days is not so great.

147
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,400
Scott: Anyone fancy a game of tennis?

148
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:29,960
Scott: I'm not a fan of Salad Days.

149
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,615
Scott: It's kind of eh.

150
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:32,660
Scott: It's not the greatest.

151
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:34,340
Rym: You know what?

152
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,799
Rym: I like almost all of Monty Python.

153
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,219
Scott: Yeah, they're mostly all great, but yeah, okay.

154
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:46,500
Rym: I mean, I think we're in the camp of most geeks where we can quote almost verbatim the entirety of the quest for the Holy Grail.

155
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:52,400
Scott: I wouldn't have time for that.

156
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:52,776
Scott: No, no, no.

157
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:52,989
Rym: Okay.

158
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:55,780
Rym: God, that'd be something to put in the experimental feed.

159
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:56,920
Scott: Yeah, we got the script.

160
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,559
Scott: It wouldn't be hard.

161
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:57,976
Scott: Yeah.

162
00:07:58,387 --> 00:07:58,658
Rym: All right.

163
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:02,400
Rym: So, uh, what are some of your favorite bands?

164
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,979
Scott: Uh, do we want to take a whole show out of that?

165
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,839
Rym: Uh, I like so much music, I could say what bands I really don't like because really- That's a lot easier.

166
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:20,560
Rym: The set of music that I like includes almost all of music that humans have ever made, and there is so little music that I honestly don't like.

167
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,012
Scott: Yep.

168
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,400
Scott: All right.

169
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,280
Scott: So let's just name a few.

170
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,680
Scott: Let's see.

171
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Scott: The big ones, I guess.

172
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,018
Rym: Big ones that we hate or we like?

173
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:25,578
Scott: Like.

174
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:26,939
Scott: That's what they're asking.

175
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,198
Rym: So, uh- You know what?

176
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:29,000
Rym: I like Buckethead.

177
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,198
Scott: Yeah, Buckethead's good.

178
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:31,120
Scott: Led Zeppelin.

179
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:32,419
Rym: Ah, Zeppelin.

180
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,100
Rym: Black Sabbath.

181
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,499
Scott: Makinai Supremacy.

182
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,500
Rym: Yeah, Slayer.

183
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:37,820
Rym: I actually do like Slayer.

184
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,320
Scott: Those Asian kung fu generation guys are cool.

185
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Rym: Yeah, I actually do really like Laruku.

186
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:44,879
Rym: I really like Ayumi Hamasaki, I'll admit that.

187
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,375
Scott: Yep.

188
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:50,180
Rym: I used to like Megumi Hayashi Bar, but then I found out about Ayumi.

189
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:51,777
Scott: Uh, Nobu.

190
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:52,700
Rym: Yeah.

191
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:55,480
Rym: A lot of soundtracks.

192
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,300
Rym: All the... Anything.

193
00:08:58,001 --> 00:09:01,779
Rym: It's not a band, but anything composed or in any way influenced by Yoko Kanno.

194
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,270
Scott: Yep.

195
00:09:03,363 --> 00:09:04,960
Rym: Or I like Wholesinger a lot.

196
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,240
Scott: What's the guy's name?

197
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,099
Scott: The... Oakenfold?

198
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:09,097
Scott: Oh, yeah.

199
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,560
Scott: He's doing a thing, but he's not really a band.

200
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,457
Scott: He's like one DJ.

201
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,437
Scott: Derek the Bandit.

202
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:17,340
Rym: It's hard to... I mean, what's a band?

203
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,157
Scott: I mean... BB King.

204
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:20,259
Rym: What's a band?

205
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:20,939
Rym: Is it just a band?

206
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:21,859
Rym: The band itself?

207
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,100
Rym: Of creative direction?

208
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,760
Rym: I mean, you could say the Gorillaz, but what is the Gorillaz?

209
00:09:26,961 --> 00:09:28,359
Scott: It's not even... It's like two people.

210
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,320
Scott: A Daft Punk.

211
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:30,879
Rym: Oh man, Daft Punk.

212
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:31,560
Rym: All right.

213
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:34,200
Rym: I liked Metallica before I found out about other metal.

214
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:35,320
Scott: I don't know.

215
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,819
Scott: There's a lot.

216
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:36,960
Rym: I like a lot of music.

217
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,059
Rym: The Red Star, Red Army Chorus I really like.

218
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,880
Scott: Who's the, um... Oh, what's this stupid guy's name at the New World Symphony?

219
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:45,740
Rym: Oh, uh, Dvorak?

220
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:46,519
Scott: Yes, god.

221
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:49,480
Scott: I was like thinking of all these composer names.

222
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,900
Scott: That was the only one that didn't come to mind.

223
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:52,400
Scott: Yeah, he's awesome.

224
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,478
Rym: All right, let's move on.

225
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
Scott: Tchaikovsky I think is actually my favorite.

226
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:55,980
Rym: I don't know.

227
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,060
Rym: I really like Rachmaninoff if we're going in that direction.

228
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,300
Rym: Hey, Bells of Moscow?

229
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:00,839
Rym: Fuck you.

230
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,076
Rym: That's one of the best... Anyway.

231
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,839
Scott: Fuck you, Swan Lake.

232
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:06,520
Rym: Swan Lake's not bad if you haven't heard the Bells of Moscow.

233
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:07,780
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

234
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,740
Rym: Or, uh, Rimsky-Korsakov.

235
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,339
Rym: I like Russian music and we'll leave it at that.

236
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:11,989
Scott: All right.

237
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:16,620
Rym: All right, uh, what are your favorite sports to A, play and B, watch?

238
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,227
Scott: Playing?

239
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:18,980
Rym: Almost anything.

240
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,049
Scott: Baseballs.

241
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:21,214
Rym: Baseball's super fun.

242
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:22,440
Scott: Air hockey.

243
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,840
Rym: Table tennis I really freaking love.

244
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,720
Rym: Counter strike.

245
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,279
Scott: Tennis.

246
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,739
Rym: Roller hockey.

247
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:28,596
Scott: Hockey.

248
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,060
Scott: Volleyball, did I say volleyball?

249
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:30,595
Scott: Running.

250
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,518
Rym: Mountain biking.

251
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,579
Rym: Mountain climbing.

252
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:33,398
Scott: Yeah, bicycling.

253
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:35,940
Scott: Boxing.

254
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,839
Scott: I haven't boxed too much, but I did a tiny bit in high school.

255
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,820
Scott: I imagine it could be fun if I didn't get my face smashed.

256
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,278
Rym: You know what?

257
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:49,399
Rym: Boxing was fun until you get to the point of fighting people as opposed to just boxing, as in punching a heavy thing and doing all the exercises.

258
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:50,939
Rym: Like kung fu.

259
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,680
Rym: I like kung fu, but I wouldn't want to actually kung fu fight anyone.

260
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:55,139
Scott: All right, uh, and watch.

261
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:55,877
Rym: Hockey.

262
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,380
Scott: I like actually playing basketball, but I don't like watching basketball at all.

263
00:10:59,482 --> 00:10:59,612
Rym: Oh, God.

264
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,420
Scott: Watching live ice hockey, number one.

265
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,000
Rym: Yeah, far and away.

266
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,352
Scott: Football, baseball, race, F1.

267
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:08,319
Rym: Just hockey.

268
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:08,959
Rym: You know what?

269
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:11,860
Rym: I really like watching kendo, but I don't like watching fencing.

270
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:17,880
Scott: Uh, I like watching, uh, I don't know, martial arts that I like watching.

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
Scott: Mostly like demonstrations of Taekwondo and stuff.

272
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,000
Scott: Like actual martial art.

273
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,579
Scott: Oh, sumo I like to watch is cool.

274
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:33,920
Rym: Actually, despite the problems of sumo, which has been talked about suddenly and kind of out of the blue in our forums, but watching an actual sumo match is super awesome.

275
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,199
Rym: I recommend you check it out.

276
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:36,596
Scott: Okay.

277
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:39,420
Scott: Do you modify your voice on the podcast at all?

278
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,600
Scott: Hey, Rym, turn off the voice modifier for a second.

279
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:42,060
Scott: Okay.

280
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,494
Rym: It's off.

281
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,498
Rym: Hi, how's it going guys?

282
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,100
Rym: What do you think about my real voice?

283
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:48,073
Rym: I don't know.

284
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,958
Rym: Maybe we should turn the thing back on.

285
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,839
Rym: I think we should talk about Animal Crossing and other games.

286
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:53,719
Scott: Oh, God.

287
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:55,057
Rym: You know what?

288
00:11:57,182 --> 00:12:01,280
Rym: No, I run a bunch of filters, but they're actually kind of like standard radio filters.

289
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,560
Rym: I run a high pass filter.

290
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:04,560
Rym: It doesn't cut out any of our voice.

291
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,919
Rym: It cuts out like breath noises and hums and like, you know, me poking at the microphone and all that stuff.

292
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:12,740
Scott: Basically, I sound the way I do on the podcast the same way.

293
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,520
Scott: If you sat here and you talked, if you put your face really close to a microphone, you sound slightly different.

294
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,198
Scott: Not much.

295
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,339
Rym: Actually, most of that is mitigated by my high pass filter too.

296
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:29,360
Rym: I mean, if we get up real close, we can kind of get a smooth radio voice, but even then that's not much of a modification.

297
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:30,095
Scott: All right.

298
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,000
Rym: And really, we don't do anything.

299
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:42,659
Rym: And our friends can attest, I believe it was Scott Johnson who expressed that on multiple occasions, he has started to yell or argue with us while listening to the show because he forgot that we're not actually there.

300
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:43,639
Scott: All righty.

301
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,360
Scott: You gonna ask this question?

302
00:12:45,442 --> 00:12:45,998
Rym: I guess I will.

303
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,960
Rym: Scott, what's the story behind all those plant pictures on Flickr?

304
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,460
Rym: Well, you see, Scott grows marijuana.

305
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,320
Scott: Yep, I grow the wacky tobacco even though I don't smoke it.

306
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:06,234
Scott: Now, I was growing a tomato plant and I said, "Hey, I'll take a picture of the tomato plant every day I remember to, and then I'll have pictures of the tomato plant and maybe we can stop motion it or

307
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:06,599
Scott: something.".

308
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,620
Scott: So I took pictures of the tomato plant, which is now pretty much done.

309
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,171
Rym: Yeah.

310
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,060
Rym: Well, the thing is, Scott actually took good care of that tomato plant, but he learned the difference between a determinate and a non-determinate tomato plant.

311
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,840
Scott: I learned a lot more than that about tomatoes.

312
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,819
Scott: That's the only interesting thing.

313
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,173
Rym: Yeah.

314
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,519
Rym: Well, the calcium thing was kind of cool.

315
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,520
Rym: I never thought about a vitamin or a calcium deficiency in a plant before.

316
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,340
Scott: All right.

317
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,970
Scott: Rym, when did you achieve your awesome hair length?

318
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:33,700
Scott: and do you have a favorite shampoo/conditioner?

319
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:35,920
Rym: I've had long hair since high school.

320
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:38,780
Rym: I don't intend to ever not have long hair.

321
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,240
Rym: If I ever started losing my hair, I would take drugs like nobody's business to make it not go away.

322
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:43,999
Scott: What if it didn't work?

323
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,880
Rym: Then I'd get surgery or something.

324
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,818
Scott: What if that didn't work?

325
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:48,100
Rym: It pretty much does.

326
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,879
Scott: You realize that- Would you ever go for the wig?

327
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:51,138
Rym: You know what?

328
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:52,016
Rym: Possibly.

329
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:52,640
Scott: All right.

330
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:53,499
Rym: If it came to that.

331
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:58,200
Rym: If I'm an old man... But the thing is, the history of my family is that hair thins, but it doesn't go away.

332
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,259
Rym: It just kind of turns silver.

333
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:08,260
Rym: But my hair used to be kind of jet black and it's really turned this kind of reddish... I like what's happened.

334
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,213
Rym: A lot of people ask me what I do to it and the answer is I go outside and there's the sun.

335
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,280
Rym: But conditioner, I use Herbal Essences kind of things.

336
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,999
Rym: Pretty much anything that smells like lavender.

337
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:19,460
Scott: You care about the smell.

338
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,499
Scott: You don't care about anything else.

339
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,820
Rym: Well, also if it works and Herbal Essences actually works pretty well.

340
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,940
Rym: There's another brand I'm using now that's really good too.

341
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,060
Rym: I forget the name of it offhand.

342
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,460
Scott: I use just whatever cheap shampoo I can get.

343
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:30,440
Scott: Swayve.

344
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:31,480
Scott: Whatever.

345
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:32,888
Scott: Prells.

346
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,279
Scott: Pert Pluses.

347
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:35,200
Scott: Anything.

348
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,180
Rym: The key is don't use expensive conditioner.

349
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,298
Rym: And two, use a lot of conditioner.

350
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:40,927
Scott: A lot.

351
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:44,040
Scott: Well, if you have a lot of hair, I guess you need to use a lot.

352
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,513
Scott: Yeah.

353
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,019
Scott: I know when I, even me, when I shampoo and I, you know, because that's all I do is shampoo and rinse it out.

354
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:53,020
Scott: When I have a little bit of hair, after I get a haircut, I don't need so much.

355
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,640
Scott: But then like now I need a lot.

356
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:55,959
Scott: So I got to get a haircut this weekend.

357
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,220
Rym: Anyway, what's your opinion on mandatory sentencing?

358
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,020
Rym: IE, another good use of IE, three strikes law and such.

359
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:10,899
Rym: Would you be interested in hearing your, oh, I would also be interested in hearing your opinions on the prison system in the US in general too.

360
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,460
Scott: Well, we're going to do a whole episode about prison action.

361
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:17,360
Rym: I'm going to say prison industrial complex and leave it at that.

362
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,719
Scott: Also generally bad.

363
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,380
Rym: Also non-violent offenders.

364
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:27,300
Rym: But anyway, I'm of the opinion that any mandatory sentencing is bullshit.

365
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,900
Scott: Because basically what you're doing is you're leaving out any sort of judging.

366
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:37,079
Scott: You're sort of, it's like, hey, some guy, you know, robbed a convenience store three times.

367
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,119
Scott: Some other guy killed three people.

368
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,279
Scott: Mandatory, it's like, what the hell?

369
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:51,600
Scott: The point of a sentence is that the judge, you know, who actually looks at this person to turn, you know, as we trust them to figure out like what would help the person the most and what's going to benefit society.

370
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,520
Rym: Because remember my idea when it comes to a justice system is that the priorities of a justice system should be exactly the following.

371
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:08,460
Rym: And in this order, one undo or mitigate harm done as best as is possible to do everything reasonable and prudent to prevent future harm.

372
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:08,816
Scott: Yep.

373
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,500
Rym: There should be no other reason to have justice.

374
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,579
Scott: Mandatory sentencing.

375
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:21,020
Scott: The only benefit you could possibly argue for it, because it's certainly not just when you enact the mandatory sentences in most cases, is that there's to be some sort of deterrent.

376
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,380
Scott: But time has proven it is not a deterrent.

377
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,560
Scott: I mean, the death penalty is not a deterrent.

378
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,970
Rym: There are deterrent effects.

379
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:34,500
Rym: And like, I think the biggest one that I've seen a lot of studies for is the automatic felony.

380
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:39,860
Rym: If you assault, you know, like a transit worker in New York City, those sorts of things work really well.

381
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:50,760
Rym: But that's the problem I have is not a mandatory charge, but a mandatory sentence, because I believe that there is always a chance for some crazy situation or a mitigating circumstance.

382
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:58,039
Rym: And I think the point of having judges is that they are the person who a human being who looks at the situation and says, you know what?

383
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:00,117
Rym: This is what I think.

384
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:02,960
Scott: Oh, the next question is one from Wednesday.

385
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,635
Scott: So skip that.

386
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:05,880
Scott: Oh, I don't know why it's messed up.

387
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,638
Scott: The copy paste.

388
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:07,439
Rym: Good job.

389
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:08,271
Rym: Oh, well.

390
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,178
Rym: Hey, so is this next one?

391
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,448
Scott: Huh?

392
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:12,438
Rym: Good job.

393
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,138
Rym: Scott did this.

394
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,637
Rym: It's all Scott.

395
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:14,040
Rym: All right.

396
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,099
Rym: Here's the next real question.

397
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,780
Rym: RIT's fees are outlandish.

398
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,739
Rym: How did you get that financed?

399
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,040
Scott: The federal student loans.

400
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,160
Rym: I got a full ride.

401
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,049
Scott: All right.

402
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,359
Scott: What's the worst idea you've ever had?

403
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,036
Rym: Well, some would argue the barge, but other people say that's the best idea we've ever had.

404
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:34,780
Scott: I don't know.

405
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:37,699
Rym: One time when I was a kid, my ideas are that bad.

406
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,097
Rym: One time when I was a kid, I got it in my head to jump out the upstairs window and I did.

407
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:46,100
Scott: I guess, yeah, when I was a kid, I thought all sorts of stupid things because I didn't know better.

408
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,617
Scott: Like I used to think, yeah, I kill all the bad guys in the world to be perfect and stuff like that.

409
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:50,899
Rym: You know what I would say?

410
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,139
Rym: Libertarianism with an uppercase L.

411
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,840
Scott: That's a pretty bad idea.

412
00:17:57,402 --> 00:18:03,540
Rym: I was much more politically revolutionary when I was younger, and that was mitigated a lot by studying history more than anything.

413
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:05,118
Scott: All right.

414
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:08,460
Scott: What do you think about threads derailing?

415
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:09,559
Rym: I think it's great.

416
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:10,679
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

417
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,279
Scott: People talk about whatever they want to.

418
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,220
Scott: What do you care if it's organized properly?

419
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:14,760
Scott: It doesn't matter.

420
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,620
Rym: It's kind of the best gift you would ever receive.

421
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:18,540
Rym: Would ever?

422
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,899
Rym: Well, the best gift I'm ever going to receive, I expect, is to be knighted and then ascend to godhood.

423
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:27,020
Scott: But why would the godhood follow knighting?

424
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,960
Rym: Well, because then I'll be given a godhood.

425
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,119
Rym: It'll be a gift from someone.

426
00:18:30,802 --> 00:18:31,639
Rym: I figure I deserve that.

427
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:33,960
Rym: At least some posthumous deification.

428
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,918
Rym: I mean, come on.

429
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,660
Scott: I'll just repeat yesterday.

430
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,660
Scott: I'll just say SDF one.

431
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,319
Scott: That'd be a nice gift.

432
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,800
Rym: The best gift I've ever gotten.

433
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:49,600
Rym: I'm actually going to... I think in terms of influence on my life, the most important gift I've ever gotten was the Nintendo Entertainment System when I was a child.

434
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,639
Rym: That's a pretty important gift.

435
00:18:51,060 --> 00:19:00,060
Rym: It sounds silly, but I really think that that influenced the person I am culturally, just culturally, not anything else, more than anything else I've ever received.

436
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:01,659
Scott: That was a pretty important gift.

437
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,378
Rym: I'm sure my mom would laugh and cry if she heard that, but...

438
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:07,680
Scott: I can't think of really... I mean, I'm not really big on gifts.

439
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:11,080
Scott: It's like, you know, now, I mean, when I was a kid, gifts would be a big deal.

440
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,000
Scott: Like, oh man, I got something because I wouldn't get much.

441
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,819
Rym: Oh, Christmas was like the most important day of the year for me.

442
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,040
Scott: But I mean, none of those are really so important.

443
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,940
Scott: And maybe the Nintendo is the most important of those.

444
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,720
Scott: And after, you know, I was a kid, I could buy whatever I wanted.

445
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:23,940
Scott: So I don't really need a gift.

446
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,839
Scott: So get like... And I'm not so materialistic.

447
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,660
Scott: I don't really like... I don't want things, you know?

448
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:37,399
Scott: It's like maybe if someone gave me enough money to significantly change my life, but really material goods aren't so great to me.

449
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,278
Rym: All right, here's another one.

450
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,940
Rym: What was the greatest thing of the day?

451
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,917
Scott: Oh, it's a tough call.

452
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,299
Rym: Things of the day.

453
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:46,999
Rym: Things of the day.

454
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:50,100
Rym: Thing, thing, thing, thing of the day.

455
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:50,937
Scott: I don't know.

456
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,232
Scott: It could be press A.

457
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:55,280
Rym: Press A. That might be because I laughed a lot at that one.

458
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,060
Rym: That was a good one.

459
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:57,380
Rym: I have a few favorites.

460
00:19:57,684 --> 00:19:59,159
Rym: It's... I don't know if I can say.

461
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,760
Scott: There's a handful of favorites, but that's the first one that came to mind.

462
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,140
Rym: I might get back to that one if I remember something.

463
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:05,580
Scott: You can't lift 10 Pokemons.

464
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,120
Rym: Oh man, that one affected the show the most.

465
00:20:08,462 --> 00:20:08,615
Scott: It did.

466
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:09,859
Scott: Okay.

467
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,180
Rym: You can't name good things of the day times 10.

468
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,940
Scott: No, not really.

469
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:14,080
Rym: All right.

470
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,300
Scott: Regardless, have either of you learned or attempted learning a foreign language?

471
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,571
Rym: Well, in high school I wanted to take Russian, but Russian was at the same time as banned, so I couldn't.

472
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,038
Rym: Then I wanted to take Japanese, but Japanese was at the same time as banned, so I couldn't.

473
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:32,500
Rym: So I wanted to take French, and nothing stopped me from taking French.

474
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:34,080
Scott: In middle school, I took Spanish.

475
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,980
Scott: In two years of high school, I took Spanish.

476
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:38,280
Scott: And I can actually kind of read a Spanish newspaper.

477
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:38,839
Scott: It's scary.

478
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,156
Rym: Yeah, I can read a French newspaper.

479
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:41,700
Rym: pretty okay.

480
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,080
Scott: Like, I can kind of figure out what a lot of the words mean, even though I haven't spoken Spanish or anything.

481
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:49,460
Scott: Like, if I'm walking around and people are speaking Spanish, I can kind of tell what they're saying, kind of.

482
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,820
Rym: I was super into it in high school.

483
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,759
Scott: But I can't speak Spanish, like, not at all.

484
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:54,799
Scott: I can say like, "Hi, how are you?

485
00:20:55,201 --> 00:20:55,953
Scott: Would you like to play

486
00:20:55,974 --> 00:20:56,238
Scott: baseball?".

487
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,620
Rym: I had a pretty good lexicon.

488
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,560
Rym: And I probably conjugated things incorrectly.

489
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:03,820
Rym: I mean, I wasn't fluent, but I could speak general.

490
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,340
Rym: I could make myself understood, I think.

491
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:06,520
Rym: Pretty okay.

492
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:18,588
Rym: The problem was, once you stop taking classes, there's absolutely no opportunity in my life to practice French at all, especially going back to RIT, where there's just no call for it.

493
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,700
Rym: If anything, in IT, I should have learned Chinese.

494
00:21:21,362 --> 00:21:21,448
Scott: Yeah.

495
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,540
Rym: Or, well, yeah, Chinese.

496
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:30,880
Scott: But I guess I've attempted to learn... I guess I've learned Japanese just by, like, osmosis.

497
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:34,580
Rym: It's scary, the stupid thing Scott and I know in Japanese.

498
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,899
Rym: Every now and then, Emily will laugh, and we just know some random words.

499
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:40,140
Scott: And of course, being a Jew, I know some Hebrew by osmosis.

500
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:43,320
Scott: But scarily, I know more Japanese by osmosis than Hebrew.

501
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:43,745
Rym: Yep.

502
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:54,920
Rym: I started trying to learn Korean, and I got to the point of being able to order liquor, and being able to say hello, and being able to ask where simple things were, and being able to ask people to give me simple things.

503
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,000
Rym: And I learned Hangul, and I promptly forgot it all.

504
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,880
Scott: As soon as I get some time, I'm gonna start learning, like, the non-Kanji languages, so I can read the sound effects in the manga.

505
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,379
Rym: Languages, you say?

506
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,238
Scott: Alphabets.

507
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:07,900
Rym: Okay.

508
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,739
Rym: So hiragana and katakana.

509
00:22:10,902 --> 00:22:12,580
Rym: I kinda learned half of hiragana.

510
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,979
Rym: I just have to practice, but I don't.

511
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:20,760
Scott: I know a few characters, mostly Ah, Ni, and Mei, 'cause it's on my Ani Mei Club t-shirt.

512
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,040
Scott: They had the three characters there, so I can recognize those.

513
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,300
Rym: Do you have any language-related stories, misinterpretations and such, involving foreigners, or you as the foreigner?

514
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:30,339
Scott: Not really.

515
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,339
Rym: Nah, sadly.

516
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:32,418
Scott: Okay.

517
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:35,380
Scott: What kind of philosophies do you guys believe in?

518
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,916
Scott: I'm talking solipsism, nihilism, humanism, existentialism, transcendentalism, that kind of stuff.

519
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:43,200
Scott: We already know you're atheist.

520
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:53,660
Rym: Well, uh, see, it depends, because on how, like, to the core you get, because at the core, you get solipsism.

521
00:22:53,722 --> 00:22:54,159
Scott: Yep, pretty much.

522
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:02,920
Rym: I mean, any other philosophy is interesting and may be applicable to the real world, but when it comes down to it, solipsism is the only thing I can trust.

523
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,720
Rym: Now, I'm assuming you know, whoever asked this, what all these mean.

524
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,399
Rym: At least I hope you do, but do you think we should explain it or just move on?

525
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:13,479
Scott: I really don't care so much.

526
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,619
Rym: All right, I'll say it this way.

527
00:23:15,264 --> 00:23:16,077
Rym: I am solipsistic.

528
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,519
Scott: All of them and none of them.

529
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:27,000
Rym: I am solipsistic in the philosophical sense, but not in the OMG, I'm the only person in the world sense, because that sense is not the point of solipsism.

530
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,538
Rym: Anyway, that's it.

531
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,900
Rym: What are some other things that are legal that others think are the law?

532
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,260
Rym: I think you mean, what are some things that are legal that people think are illegal?

533
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:42,440
Rym: One of them is not identifying yourself unless you are being arrested.

534
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:49,620
Scott: Well, different states, like, for example, I know in some states if a police officer asks you, all you have to do is tell them your name and address.

535
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,700
Scott: You don't have to tell them anything else unless you're arrested.

536
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,939
Rym: Yeah, one thing that's important is if you don't want to talk to a police officer and they're in uniform and on duty.

537
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:06,980
Rym: And of course, this probably varies again from state to state, but at least where I've lived, if they're not arresting you, you are always free to go and just say, walk away.

538
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:08,779
Scott: Can I leave now?

539
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,300
Scott: And if they say yes, if they're not arresting you and then you leave.

540
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,360
Scott: The only possible exception is if they say no, then they're detaining you, which is a whole other story.

541
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,920
Rym: They can detain you a little bit, but not forever.

542
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,019
Rym: And they can't arrest you.

543
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,020
Rym: And there's all sorts of crap.

544
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,138
Scott: Unless they have a reason to arrest you.

545
00:24:22,621 --> 00:24:25,440
Rym: Yeah, you don't need to show the receipt when you walk out of a store.

546
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,860
Rym: Private citizens cannot detain you, period.

547
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,720
Scott: You can use your camera pretty much anywhere on public property or anywhere from public property.

548
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,860
Scott: So if you're standing on public property, you can take pictures of private property.

549
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,678
Scott: Now, a lot of cities.

550
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,039
Scott: As long as you don't use like a zoom lens to zoom in.

551
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:46,959
Rym: I mean, a lot of cities are passing really crap laws, particularly New York City, about that.

552
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,180
Rym: But generally, by and large.

553
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,360
Rym: And there's a thing online called the Photographer's Bill of Rights.

554
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,000
Rym: You can look up if you're as far as I've read.

555
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,159
Rym: And a lot of people seem to agree.

556
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,940
Rym: If you're on public property, anything you take a picture of is fair game.

557
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,540
Rym: People, dogs, someone's windows open and they're naked picture.

558
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:01,880
Rym: Great.

559
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,000
Scott: There's however, according to Emily, in some places like in New York City, there are like ordinances like that's not according to the law.

560
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Rym: There's signs everywhere.

561
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,880
Scott: You can't use like tripods and things.

562
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,503
Rym: Oh yeah, that's.

563
00:25:11,564 --> 00:25:14,978
Rym: that's different because that could be an obstruction because then you're setting up.

564
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,219
Scott: If you got like your little digital camera, you're good to go.

565
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,900
Rym: Now, using those pictures is a different story altogether.

566
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:27,219
Rym: But generally, from what I've read, posting those pictures in something like Flickr or for free in a non-commercial way is almost always OK.

567
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:30,640
Rym: The problem is if you take a picture of a copyrighted work.

568
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:33,180
Rym: We're not lawyers, so I can't talk about that.

569
00:25:34,627 --> 00:25:35,220
Rym: I don't know.

570
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,660
Rym: This isn't a really interesting question.

571
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:40,440
Scott: OK, what if one of you guys suddenly died?

572
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:42,479
Rym: Well, we haven't planned for that.

573
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:53,599
Rym: So GeekNights might go on a quite not permanent, but definitely month long hiatus as, you know, papers were filed to get passwords to things.

574
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:03,080
Scott: Yeah, they'd probably be lots of, you know, I guess funeral type activities and that sort of stuff and not working, working again.

575
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,140
Rym: If we get to the next level and we start having more because right now, Scott pretty much handles all the system side of everything.

576
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,880
Rym: And I handle the audio and archiving side of everything.

577
00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:17,040
Rym: And like Scott handles like our artist stuff and I handle our producer PR stuff.

578
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,380
Rym: And we don't really overlap a lot on that.

579
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,280
Rym: So if one of us went, the show would stop for a while until we found someone who could do the rest of that.

580
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,100
Rym: And I don't think one person could do it all.

581
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:27,620
Scott: No, I don't think so either.

582
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,559
Rym: But content wise, I don't know.

583
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:32,779
Rym: I can think of a couple of people that could possibly replace either of us.

584
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:38,260
Scott: Have you guys ever gone on any epic quests like Harold and Kumar going to White Castle?

585
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,220
Scott: We try many, but many.

586
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:42,473
Scott: We tried to get to that Miyamoto.

587
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:50,080
Rym: I guess if you count that, I think that was an epic quest that ended in failure and taught us that you can't half ass an epic quest.

588
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,500
Scott: We tried to get to the Bob Evans and failed.

589
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,560
Rym: Oh, God, that that wasn't an epic quest.

590
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,280
Rym: That was a series of the failed side quest multiple.

591
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,960
Rym: There's this Bob Evans in Rochester.

592
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:07,420
Rym: And any time we ever went like to the beach or anywhere up north on the way back, we'd always be super hungry and we'd see this Bob Evans.

593
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,719
Rym: We're like, God damn.

594
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:09,519
Rym: And it's on the right.

595
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,558
Rym: We're like, all right, let's go.

596
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:15,235
Rym: If you just try to turn right, that's the on ramp to the freeway and there's no way back.

597
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:16,018
Scott: Yep.

598
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,480
Rym: And for the life of us, we could not figure out how to get to this goddamn Bob Evans.

599
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,357
Scott: And we never got to it.

600
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,000
Rym: It was awful.

601
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:25,720
Rym: In high school, I went on a bunch of these.

602
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,353
Rym: We just like.

603
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:29,258
Scott: The fuck was that?

604
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:29,900
Scott: The truck?

605
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:30,549
Rym: Yeah.

606
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,600
Rym: Well, I did anyway.

607
00:27:33,743 --> 00:27:35,359
Rym: There was a loud noise that startled me.

608
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,660
Rym: But in high school, a lot of times me and my friends, we just be like, you want to just go to Cedar Point?

609
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:42,740
Rym: Yeah, let's go to Cedar Point.

610
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:49,900
Scott: Just fucking leave and skip school and something epic would always happen on the way back from Otakon once we had that side quest for gasoline.

611
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:52,320
Rym: Oh, yes, I was asleep through.

612
00:27:52,601 --> 00:27:52,880
Rym: All right.

613
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,459
Rym: So here's the deal.

614
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,920
Rym: We're driving back from Otakon and I'm too tired to drive.

615
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,600
Rym: So I say, all right, you two clowns want to use driving?

616
00:27:59,722 --> 00:28:00,760
Rym: And I fell asleep in the back.

617
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:02,520
Scott: I drove Rims car home from Otakon.

618
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:09,080
Rym: I woke up and I noticed we're not on a freeway anymore and there's no lights anywhere.

619
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,099
Rym: And we're going real slow.

620
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,599
Rym: So I'm like, guys, what's going on?

621
00:28:15,381 --> 00:28:16,000
Scott: Where are we?

622
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,140
Scott: Basically running out of gas and there was no stop for a long time.

623
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,307
Scott: So I got off the first exit.

624
00:28:20,347 --> 00:28:23,798
Scott: I could and there was a gas station, but it was old fashioned, needed a guy to pump the gas.

625
00:28:24,221 --> 00:28:27,700
Scott: But there was a guy there, but he was inside and he waved at us like, sorry.

626
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:31,080
Scott: So I drove around trying to get back on the highway, but I failed.

627
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,040
Scott: So I like up this mountain road that was scary and dark and empty.

628
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,119
Scott: So then we finally got back on the highway after a long time thinking we're going to run out of gas.

629
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:40,799
Scott: And then we got to the next exit miraculously and got gas.

630
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,700
Rym: I think my biggest epic quest was the time.

631
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,940
Rym: Well, there's that long road trip I went on, but the time kind of out of the blue.

632
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:57,940
Rym: I drove with Luke and Scojo to Anime Central from Rochester in a car that broke down in Indiana and we had to hobble it into Michigan to get it fixed.

633
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:00,720
Rym: And I'm not going to tell the story that would really derail this.

634
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,540
Rym: But suffice to say, that was an epic, epic trip.

635
00:29:05,102 --> 00:29:05,358
Scott: All right.

636
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,918
Scott: What scares you the most?

637
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:08,260
Rym: In anything?

638
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,220
Scott: I just said what scares you the most, movie, video games, Goatsy.

639
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,038
Scott: I guess none of those.

640
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,700
Scott: I'm not scared of movies, video games or Goatsy.

641
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,158
Rym: You know, Goatsy startled me the first time I saw it because all I could think was, what is that?

642
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:20,028
Rym: There's no way.

643
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:20,919
Rym: it's what I think it is.

644
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:21,879
Scott: Oh, God.

645
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,740
Scott: What scares me the most, pretty much one of the only things that scares me is like doctoring.

646
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,800
Scott: If I watch a surgery on TV or I think about getting surgeries or anything like that.

647
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:37,819
Rym: Sadly, I just really don't get scared easily or often.

648
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,700
Scott: Or better.

649
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,420
Rym: Or better yet, what are laws that you think are stupid?

650
00:29:45,142 --> 00:29:47,539
Rym: We can't see a patriot that will derail the show.

651
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:49,960
Rym: What life events would cause you to pod fade?

652
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:50,900
Scott: We both died.

653
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:53,820
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

654
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:55,260
Scott: The Internet stopped working.

655
00:29:55,782 --> 00:29:56,640
Rym: It would take a lot.

656
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:57,800
Scott: House burned down.

657
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,360
Rym: Even if one of us lost our job, we have plenty of money to keep it going.

658
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,420
Rym: You know, both of us lost our jobs.

659
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,760
Rym: We have plenty of money to keep it going.

660
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:10,839
Rym: If the house burned down, I could just buy all new equipment and start going like the next day from the hotel room.

661
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:19,319
Rym: Yeah, if there were if if social order broke down in the United States, that's pretty much what it would take.

662
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,040
Scott: And even then, I'd be doing something else besides podcasting.

663
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,500
Scott: Even then, I'd probably still be doing something on the Internet.

664
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:29,660
Rym: Oh, at that point, if that's the thing, if social order broke down, GeekNights would basically become Radio Free America.

665
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,536
Scott: It's not like that.

666
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:31,591
Scott: Right.

667
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,000
Rym: You guys often talk about business plans that you're unable to pursue.

668
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:41,040
Rym: If someone gave you ten million dollars to start a business, what would you do?

669
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,000
Scott: Live off the interest and do whatever I wanted.

670
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,819
Rym: I'd start the ten million dollar.

671
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:47,000
Rym: Rym lives off the interest and does whatever he wanted.

672
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,099
Rym: Yeah, I'd invest in a lot of public works.

673
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,900
Rym: I'd I wouldn't start a company.

674
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Rym: I wouldn't do a business.

675
00:30:52,162 --> 00:30:54,600
Rym: I would just do what I think was right in the world with my money.

676
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,639
Scott: There are basically three three businesses I would do.

677
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,820
Scott: One business would be like the GeekNights Company or the Front Row Crew Studios or whatever.

678
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:06,118
Scott: Another business would be the local computer repair shop, because that would be like, ah.

679
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,860
Rym: One might be the turn the American anime industry on its head.

680
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,779
Scott: Maybe the only other one I can think of would be get a Wii or DS development kit and start doing the business.

681
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,420
Rym: But seriously, those would all effectively be hobbies.

682
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:27,940
Rym: If I had that much money, I would honestly just use that money to affect the world in the ways that I wanted in order to affect the change that I wanted.

683
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,920
Rym: And that would be the end of it.

684
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,240
Rym: A business is just a means to get the money to do those things.

685
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,460
Scott: Do you have a clever answer to the next question?

686
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:37,199
Rym: Not really.

687
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,417
Rym: Want to skip it?

688
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,260
Scott: How do you feel about self referential questions?

689
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:41,654
Rym: They're OK.

690
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,600
Rym: How come you guys can't make your own show ideas up?

691
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:45,639
Scott: All right.

692
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:51,620
Scott: You try coming up with four ideas every week that don't require research that you can just do at the spur of the moment.

693
00:31:51,782 --> 00:31:53,280
Scott: And you already know everything you need to know.

694
00:31:53,461 --> 00:31:55,700
Scott: And it'll be fun for you to actually do that idea.

695
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,479
Rym: Not just fun for you, but fun for two people.

696
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:57,780
Rym: Yeah.

697
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,380
Rym: You know how often we come home and I'm like, man, we should totally do a show on Mudkips.

698
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,008
Rym: And Scott's like, ah.

699
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:03,078
Scott: Yeah.

700
00:32:03,262 --> 00:32:04,700
Scott: I mean, it's not easy.

701
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,400
Scott: I mean, we can come up with a shit ton of ideas.

702
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,479
Scott: The hard part is we both want to do them.

703
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:09,919
Scott: We're both ready to do them.

704
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:11,559
Scott: They match the current day.

705
00:32:12,105 --> 00:32:13,000
Scott: You know, it's not easy.

706
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,200
Rym: What originally prompted you guys to start the GeekNights podcast?

707
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,639
Scott: I was sitting around.

708
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,700
Scott: Oh, well, back in the day before podcasts even were the thing.

709
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,820
Rym: This is actually a good story.

710
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,800
Scott: We would every night, pretty much, we lived in the same place in college.

711
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,159
Rym: We kind of went to bed the way Anthe and Utena do.

712
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,940
Scott: Not so close.

713
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,460
Rym: Not so close, but the same.

714
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:35,599
Rym: Watch the show.

715
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:35,960
Rym: You'll see.

716
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,559
Scott: We would talk.

717
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:43,679
Scott: And like when even when just people would come over to our house, we'd all sit around and me and Rym would talk and other people wouldn't talk as much.

718
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:50,560
Rym: It wasn't just when we went to bed, but oftentimes when not when we had a huge group of people over, but when we had people over at our house and it was late at night.

719
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,920
Scott: Especially like new people who didn't know us too well and they would be shy.

720
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,900
Scott: Like we would start talking to each other and these people just listening would be cracking up and falling all over themselves.

721
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:02,560
Rym: And not like just it was weird.

722
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:09,139
Rym: The conversations in our apartment often turned into me and Scott talking and everyone else being an audience straight up.

723
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:10,560
Rym: Not even just watching.

724
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,240
Scott: And as you know, we were technologically minded.

725
00:33:13,381 --> 00:33:15,540
Scott: We would always think, why are we recording everything we say?

726
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,700
Scott: Why are we recording everything?

727
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,899
Scott: Why are we recording every day?

728
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,719
Rym: And we were like, we should totally make an Internet radio show like Pillow Talk with Rym and Scott.

729
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,016
Rym: Yeah.

730
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,480
Scott: And one one time I did.

731
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:29,080
Scott: In fact, I think it's still on the Internet somewhere on my blog, which I have actually updated twice recently.

732
00:33:30,382 --> 00:33:38,299
Scott: I just recorded myself talking into like my Logitech headset and tried to make an audio blog, which was before podcasting around the same time as podcasting.

733
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:46,860
Scott: And then eventually when we kind of let that slide and when I got the iPod Nano, I discovered podcasting because I started using iTunes.

734
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,519
Rym: And I thought podcasting was stupid and I ignored it.

735
00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:52,760
Scott: And then, you know, I started listening to a bunch of podcasts.

736
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,100
Scott: Then one day I was like, hey, Rym, you might just do this freaking podcast thing.

737
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,100
Rym: And I thought about it and I realized that we had everything we needed and we had money.

738
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:02,960
Rym: And the other thing was and this is, I think, the real impetus.

739
00:34:03,802 --> 00:34:04,408
Rym: We had both.

740
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:05,519
Rym: we're out of college now.

741
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:07,620
Rym: We have a big house upstate.

742
00:34:07,802 --> 00:34:09,219
Rym: We make a shit ton of money.

743
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,040
Rym: We're working in the city like everything's great in our lives.

744
00:34:12,263 --> 00:34:13,299
Rym: We come home every day.

745
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:21,739
Rym: We watch a movie or two or two episodes of anime, play a bunch of video games for like an hour or two, play German board games all night.

746
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:30,380
Rym: Like I was living the dream was everything I had wanted from college, except, of course, you know, all the people of college to be around with me regardless.

747
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,360
Rym: And suddenly that became unfulfilling.

748
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,435
Rym: I felt like I'm not going to a cop like I wouldn't get.

749
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:39,679
Scott: what it was is in college.

750
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:45,179
Scott: We had a whole bunch of free time, but we didn't have enough money to purchase enough entertainment to occupy that free time.

751
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,400
Scott: If we had more money, we could have had more fun in college.

752
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,000
Scott: However, when we got out of college, we had a bunch of money and not so much free time.

753
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,819
Scott: So we bought all this stuff because we were acting like we're still in college, but we couldn't enjoy all the stuff.

754
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,760
Scott: So we'd come home like, oh, man, look at all this stuff.

755
00:35:01,362 --> 00:35:03,240
Scott: And eventually we're just like, all right, I'm tired of stuff.

756
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:08,700
Scott: And that's when we felt like we had to do something and create something rather than just enjoy things that someone else created.

757
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,735
Rym: Now, part of that, honestly, you can trace back to the RIT Anime Club.

758
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:22,340
Rym: because one thing I mean, we you know, we're in college and we went to anime cons and stuff, but even like the first anime con we ever went to, we ended up doing a panel.

759
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:26,360
Rym: And we did this more and more and things like that.

760
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,940
Rym: And then, you know, I was the president of the anime club.

761
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:35,840
Rym: And while Scott didn't have an official position, he actually did a lot of work for the anime club and got no respect, no respect.

762
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,338
Rym: We didn't really think about it then.

763
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:55,140
Rym: But and this might sound a little egotistical, but having an audience of that many people and having the just creating content in any way, like running that club or being up in front of people or it even sounds silly, but being able to be on the other side of the table at an anime convention or on the stage instead of in the crowd.

764
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:07,040
Rym: Or like I wouldn't even be going to anime conventions anymore if I wasn't podcasting because I just going to an event like that is not fun for me unless I'm doing something that is to be perfectly honest.

765
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,680
Scott: I mean, anime cons are super fun when I first went to them.

766
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,180
Scott: But nowadays, I guess gaming cons are still fun because I'd be playing games.

767
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:17,340
Scott: But and I guess like penguin, something like that, if it happened again, could be awesome.

768
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,300
Scott: But anime cons really aren't fun for me anymore unless I'm running stuff.

769
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,938
Scott: Then the super fun.

770
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,440
Rym: And, you know, we had fans, we had audiences.

771
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:28,300
Rym: And when we left college, that went away.

772
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,660
Rym: And one day I realized that, wow, I'm going to be like that Jim Carrey sketch.

773
00:36:31,761 --> 00:36:33,400
Rym: I'm going to have to reach back for glory.

774
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:39,979
Rym: And I realized that I never in my life want to be at a point where I'm going to have to reach backward in time to find my glory days.

775
00:36:41,061 --> 00:36:45,080
Rym: And now we have a large audience of people that are listening to this right now.

776
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:46,700
Rym: So I feel like I'm accomplishing something.

777
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:47,679
Scott: All right.

778
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:49,139
Rym: That's the short answer.

779
00:36:50,145 --> 00:36:50,719
Scott: Are you gay?

780
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,860
Scott: No messing around.

781
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,420
Scott: Just tell us so we can stop the charade and spoil everyone's fun.

782
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,860
Scott: Emily, we gay?

783
00:36:56,843 --> 00:36:57,136
Scott: Yes.

784
00:36:58,689 --> 00:36:59,120
Scott: So great.

785
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:06,339
Rym: You know, it's funny because the people who seem to actually think we're gay tend to not live in urban areas.

786
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:11,720
Rym: And when I say urban areas, I mean like tier one urban areas for many of you out there.

787
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:20,700
Rym: I just like to point out that in like New York City, two or three or five guys sharing an apartment and living the way we do is like beyond common.

788
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,338
Scott: Yeah.

789
00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:23,340
Rym: And two, no, we're not gay.

790
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:35,900
Rym: In fact, to anyone who knew me prior to podcasting or knows me in my real life, especially if you knew me in high school or in the first several years of college, I think gay would be the last word that would have been used.

791
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,220
Rym: And I think a lot of other words involving, I don't know, let's just leave it at that.

792
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:43,780
Rym: I fancied myself the ladies man.

793
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:49,680
Rym: And there are kind of funny pictures of me being the ladies man from the perspective of the camera.

794
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,519
Scott: Like the one rewearing the tiara or the one rewearing the dress.

795
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:58,839
Rym: Or anytime there's a picture of me and women that was taken by someone other than me or I don't know the cameras there.

796
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:01,518
Rym: I always have this look on my face of hey there.

797
00:38:04,121 --> 00:38:05,279
Rym: Yeah, we're not gay.

798
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,580
Scott: What are your views on immigration?

799
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,679
Scott: How do you feel about the so-called wall of shame?

800
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,179
Scott: What do you think of the Minutemen?

801
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,660
Rym: It's complicated.

802
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,120
Rym: I think we should do a show on it.

803
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:22,540
Scott: My general stance is that I don't like illegal immigration, but I do think we should just allow legal immigration for anybody.

804
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,319
Scott: Let them all in.

805
00:38:24,141 --> 00:38:29,798
Rym: I kind of disagree with that because it economically, history has shown that that almost never ends well.

806
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,959
Scott: Oh, well, tough.

807
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,300
Scott: And Minutemen, those guys are just murderers.

808
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,020
Rym: Well, as far as I know, most of them didn't kill people.

809
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,160
Rym: They just marched up and down.

810
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,459
Rym: And if they saw someone coming across the border illegally, they grabbed him and took him to the police.

811
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,639
Scott: So then they're just vigilantes then?

812
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:43,180
Scott: Yeah.

813
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,559
Scott: So how are you feeling about vigilantes?

814
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:45,956
Scott: Yeah.

815
00:38:46,422 --> 00:38:47,520
Rym: All right, here's a better question.

816
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:51,740
Rym: Who are all the members of the front row crew and how did you meet all of them?

817
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,320
Rym: If it's too long, just list the top 10.

818
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,800
Rym: No pressure.

819
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,720
Rym: Now, I find this funny because the top 10, right?

820
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,418
Rym: No matter who we say, someone's going to hear this and think, how come they didn't say me?

821
00:39:06,823 --> 00:39:09,860
Rym: I guess we could at least tell the story of how we met because it's actually kind of short.

822
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,658
Scott: So we went to RIT.

823
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:13,820
Rym: We're all freshmen in college.

824
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,598
Scott: And what do we do?

825
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,508
Scott: We don't know anyone there, right?

826
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,619
Scott: We're just freshmen, but I know it's RIT.

827
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,260
Scott: I know there's a million nerds everywhere.

828
00:39:20,642 --> 00:39:23,360
Scott: So where do I look to find more nerds that I know will be my friend?

829
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,380
Rym: The gaming club.

830
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,760
Scott: The gaming club and the anime club.

831
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,200
Scott: So I go to the gaming club and I carry my little box of battle tech.

832
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:29,896
Scott: And what do you know?

833
00:39:30,362 --> 00:39:31,759
Scott: There's a game of D&D going on.

834
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,079
Scott: So I hop on in and I meet some people.

835
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,899
Rym: Most of the front row crew, like almost all the founding members of the front row crew played in that D&D game.

836
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:40,360
Scott: Yep.

837
00:39:40,741 --> 00:39:44,632
Scott: And then, you know, I went to the anime club before the gaming club, but it's an anime club.

838
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,760
Scott: You sit there, look at a screen.

839
00:39:45,901 --> 00:39:48,780
Scott: It's kind of cool if I didn't talk to anyone there except Luke Morgan.

840
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:56,579
Rym: If our lives were an anime, it would like the flashback now would cut back to like the first anime club and show like this huge room with hundreds of people in it.

841
00:39:57,281 --> 00:40:12,380
Rym: And then the room would kind of like fade to dark a little bit, but there'd be kind of light circles around the faces of like 20 different people like those people who don't know each other yet are going to form the constellation much like the fist of the North star and achieve greatness.

842
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:21,500
Scott: And then of course, being nerds that went, there were the kind of nerds that would go to the first gaming club and anime club meetings at RIT at the next anime club meeting.

843
00:40:21,741 --> 00:40:23,079
Scott: Hey, I recognize you.

844
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,000
Rym: We all noticed each other.

845
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,839
Scott: And then we were all freshmen.

846
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:30,098
Scott: So of course, when we went to the freshman eatery, we recognized each other like, Hey, I recognize you.

847
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,180
Rym: And over time, like we coalesced into like three groups of eating and then they coalesced into one.

848
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:37,880
Rym: And then the chaff kind of got cut off bit by bit.

849
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,860
Rym: And over time, the core group of the crew just kind of emerged spontaneously.

850
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,359
Rym: And then we recognized it as such, partly because we were almost as a group kicked out of the anime club.

851
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,339
Rym: Little did they know that we would take it over the following year.

852
00:40:53,622 --> 00:41:02,760
Rym: But they called us that front row crew because we all sat in the front row and we were rowdy and unruly and loud and cause nothing but trouble.

853
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,377
Scott: All right.

854
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,508
Rym: And from there, we actually kind of formed.

855
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:11,180
Rym: we had semi formalized ways of voting on things in the front row crew for a long time.

856
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,160
Scott: Yeah, I'm trying to hurry this up here.

857
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:13,305
Scott: Why?

858
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,180
Scott: Because I would like to answer more questions rather than less.

859
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,680
Rym: But I think people want to hear the story.

860
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,060
Scott: We've told the story before in the podcast also, so they can go listen to that.

861
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,099
Rym: Obviously, they didn't listen.

862
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:22,740
Scott: That's right.

863
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,519
Rym: They can go back.

864
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,500
Rym: If you guys wanted to hear the rest, well, you can blame Scott.

865
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,240
Scott: You can go listen to the freaking old episodes.

866
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,720
Rym: What's your next question, Scott?

867
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:32,740
Scott: A better question, which is actually says on the paper.

868
00:41:33,223 --> 00:41:35,980
Scott: What do you think of the gay thread fan fiction fan art?

869
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,280
Rym: Well, I mean, you can make pretty good shirts with gay thread, but you know what?

870
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,540
Rym: I find it hilarious.

871
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,400
Scott: I don't think it's that funny, but whatever.

872
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,040
Rym: No, I find I find the idea of it hilarious.

873
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,940
Scott: More importantly, I find the idea of it hilarious either.

874
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,499
Rym: But whatever blows your boat, I'll admit when I saw that fan art, I lost it.

875
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,583
Rym: I just I could.

876
00:41:56,603 --> 00:41:59,699
Rym: I can't even think of it.

877
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,435
Scott: All right.

878
00:42:00,762 --> 00:42:01,035
Rym: All right.

879
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:02,640
Rym: Oh, this is a good question.

880
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:09,219
Rym: But not because it's a good question regarding the epic struggle among the four major factions of the world.

881
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:10,879
Rym: Who do you think will win?

882
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,880
Rym: Monkeys, ninjas, pirates or robots?

883
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,916
Rym: And the answer is unimaginative people that were stuck in the late 90s.

884
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:20,600
Scott: I think the real answer is robots.

885
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,196
Scott: And here's why.

886
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,880
Scott: Monkeys are just monkeys.

887
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,940
Scott: They're not like super powered.

888
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,660
Scott: Even gorillas.

889
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,559
Scott: Not so powerful ninjas.

890
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:28,560
Scott: The real ninjas in the real world.

891
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,660
Scott: Not so exciting.

892
00:42:30,162 --> 00:42:34,379
Scott: Pirates in the real world have guns and rockets and they could beat both monkeys and ninjas.

893
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,880
Scott: Robots are real and robots have the potential to beat even pirates.

894
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:38,457
Scott: Robots win.

895
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:46,740
Rym: But here's the real answer, because I see a lot of people wearing shirts that cons they're like pirate versus ninja or even worse.

896
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:55,640
Rym: I see a lot of people in artist alleys trying to still market this pirates versus ninjas thing and pirate ninja zombie robot monkey Frankenstein vampire.

897
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,280
Rym: But the thing is, they all deal with rare exception.

898
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:01,100
Rym: And they do it really uncreatively.

899
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,341
Rym: And it seems like that nowadays the whole pirate versus ninja thing is almost a sign of.

900
00:43:07,845 --> 00:43:10,060
Rym: you could have been cleverer, but you weren't.

901
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,903
Rym: And it's just.

902
00:43:11,305 --> 00:43:14,060
Rym: it's so overplayed and it's not funny anymore at all.

903
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:14,536
Scott: Yeah.

904
00:43:14,941 --> 00:43:20,640
Rym: In fact, I think the most recent poop jokes and top hats, Wondermark.

905
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:22,339
Scott: Excellent choice.

906
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,360
Rym: I think that they just said exactly what I said in fewer words.

907
00:43:26,611 --> 00:43:26,759
Scott: Yep.

908
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:26,982
Scott: OK.

909
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,099
Scott: KMFDM or MDFMK?

910
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:33,700
Rym: Oh, well, I can't click on the links because this is a piece of paper.

911
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,819
Scott: I don't know what MDFMK is, so I'll say KMFDM.

912
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,420
Rym: Yeah, I'm going to have to go with the same.

913
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:40,072
Rym: What is MDFMK?

914
00:43:40,093 --> 00:43:40,980
Rym: or did you just make that up?

915
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:41,680
Scott: I have no idea.

916
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,220
Scott: And I click on the link to find out, but I'm using a piece of paper.

917
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,440
Rym: Have either of you ever had a sleepwalking problem?

918
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:47,831
Rym: Nope.

919
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,358
Rym: Nope.

920
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:51,600
Rym: Are you still working on your how to podcast book?

921
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,114
Rym: That's yep.

922
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:53,137
Scott: All right.

923
00:43:54,262 --> 00:43:57,800
Scott: We know you're all about the geeky conventions and such, except for tech conventions.

924
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,719
Scott: But what are your thoughts?

925
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,480
Scott: The not quite convention event events like 24 hour film marathons?

926
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,980
Rym: I used to find them awesome when I had infinite free time.

927
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,940
Rym: We'd marathon anime regularly.

928
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,440
Scott: Yeah, but now they take too much time.

929
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:11,420
Rym: It's sad.

930
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,280
Rym: But now, like, I want to marathon a show like, yeah, let's watch all Elazar because it's great.

931
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:19,860
Rym: But I also want to hang out with my friends and play video games with my friends.

932
00:44:20,302 --> 00:44:24,120
Rym: And it's like watching something is the least active thing.

933
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,400
Rym: Like, it relies the least on being social.

934
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:28,120
Rym: As a result, it always falls by the wayside.

935
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:37,160
Scott: Please confirm your political position and explain and defend your statement that anyone can be able to be fired at any time for any reason apart from race, sex, etcetera.

936
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,120
Rym: One, it's that way in almost every state in the United States.

937
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:44,980
Rym: That, like, the idea that you can't just be fired without cause is super rare.

938
00:44:45,501 --> 00:44:49,500
Scott: You can only not be fired it for a discriminatory reason.

939
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,140
Scott: For example, I'm firing you because you're Asian or I'm firing you because you're a woman.

940
00:44:54,263 --> 00:44:54,998
Scott: You can't do that.

941
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:58,980
Scott: But for any other reason, like, I don't think I don't like the work you're doing.

942
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,497
Scott: You're fired.

943
00:44:59,962 --> 00:45:03,180
Scott: Even if they're doing great work and can prove they're doing great work, it doesn't matter.

944
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,839
Scott: You're the boss, supposedly.

945
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:06,060
Scott: So it's up to you.

946
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:08,480
Scott: You have complete control over your business.

947
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:09,939
Scott: That's what capitalism is.

948
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,380
Scott: You run a business, you do whatever you want.

949
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,758
Rym: I have two answers, and I think both of them are probably equally valid.

950
00:45:15,822 --> 00:45:23,800
Rym: One is that the moment you set up an economy or a situation where there are people who are protected from being fired.

951
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:31,759
Rym: Now, there are exceptions to this, like monopolies, local monopolies, like, for example, coal miners in a coal mining town.

952
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:32,604
Scott: That this is.

953
00:45:32,624 --> 00:45:35,100
Scott: you're coming up with my argument about unions from a week ago.

954
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:37,140
Rym: Yeah, but those are rare exceptions.

955
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:42,240
Rym: And even then, things like I think a union is a much better way to handle that than a law.

956
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:51,960
Rym: But the moment you say that someone cannot be fired from a job, you're setting up a situation where people will do poor work and nothing can be done.

957
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,000
Rym: And you might say, oh, but that's not necessarily true.

958
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,640
Scott: I submit to you communist Russia.

959
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,899
Rym: Oh, worse than that.

960
00:45:59,082 --> 00:46:00,540
Rym: And there are many examples.

961
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,720
Rym: I'm not going to get into details.

962
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:17,500
Rym: I don't want to derail it, but read about what is going on in the nation of France right now, specifically in terms of jobs and the economy, because the worker protection laws in France are to the point that it's practically destroying the economy of France.

963
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,200
Rym: And it's not just France.

964
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,640
Rym: There are a lot of places where this is true.

965
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:31,059
Rym: And regardless of your ideology, history shows that the moment you alter the an employer can fire someone whenever they want principle, you're effectively ruining the economy of that country.

966
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,105
Scott: I mean, think about it.

967
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,040
Scott: to be perfectly honest, be honest with yourself.

968
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:41,336
Scott: If there was no way that you could be fired or if there was some way you could prevent yourself from being fired with some sort of protection, would you?

969
00:46:41,356 --> 00:46:46,080
Scott: I would just completely stop working and do whatever I wanted at home as soon as I enabled that protect or even worse.

970
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,860
Rym: What if I have a little small company, right?

971
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:54,378
Rym: Like I'm running a local burger joint that I started with my friends and I hire a guy to sweep the floor.

972
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:58,680
Rym: And what if he just decides not to sweep the floor anymore?

973
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,760
Scott: I should be able to find some way to make it illegal for me to fire him.

974
00:47:02,982 --> 00:47:04,418
Rym: So I'm forced to keep an employee.

975
00:47:04,861 --> 00:47:09,978
Scott: I'm forced to lose all this money to a guy just because I accidentally hired someone who was an ass.

976
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,157
Rym: All right.

977
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,180
Rym: Is this view applicable just in your line of work or for everyone?

978
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,820
Rym: How can people bill?

979
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,959
Rym: Oh, it's the same question.

980
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:23,040
Rym: How can people build for a future, get a mortgage, go on holiday, et cetera, if they might not have an income next month?

981
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,040
Rym: Not every sector has so many job opportunities.

982
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,180
Rym: You describe an IT as having where you live.

983
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:27,776
Rym: I'll say this.

984
00:47:28,821 --> 00:47:34,759
Rym: If you want to have pretty much guaranteed employment, you have to live in a major urban center.

985
00:47:35,082 --> 00:47:36,279
Rym: Otherwise you're taking a risk.

986
00:47:36,783 --> 00:47:37,420
Rym: That's the sad fact.

987
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,940
Scott: It's your decision where to live.

988
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:44,320
Scott: So if there's nowhere to work where you live, you either move or deal with it.

989
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:51,479
Scott: And second of all, if you don't have any skills that are valuable in the current world, that's sort of your fault.

990
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:57,000
Scott: You should go learn something about, you know, or get some skills that are, you know, valuable.

991
00:47:57,581 --> 00:48:01,920
Scott: Or at least, I mean, that's like saying, oh man, I'm a good musket repair man.

992
00:48:01,941 --> 00:48:02,024
Scott: Yeah.

993
00:48:02,581 --> 00:48:04,095
Scott: You're going to find a lot of work in the 21st century.

994
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,880
Rym: Actually, you will in a lot of historical societies.

995
00:48:07,222 --> 00:48:09,339
Scott: And I know you get the idea.

996
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:21,339
Scott: You know, if you have a, if your skills are outdated or if your skill, for example, if you're a corn farmer living in New York city, not too much work for you, you move or learn different skills.

997
00:48:21,422 --> 00:48:22,139
Scott: Those are your choices.

998
00:48:22,882 --> 00:48:26,340
Scott: If you're not making money, there are plenty of jobs to go around going Craigslist.

999
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,300
Scott: There's a million companies looking to hire people.

1000
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,760
Scott: The problem is plenty of things that people don't know.

1001
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,360
Rym: Most of those companies are in major cities.

1002
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,100
Rym: And if you, if you want guaranteed employment, you have to move to a major city.

1003
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,800
Rym: That's kind of the cause benefit of having a city.

1004
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,279
Scott: You know, it doesn't have to be a city, but you have to learn valuable skills that are valuable to somebody with money.

1005
00:48:44,702 --> 00:48:47,460
Scott: And then you have to move somewhere where those skills are in demand.

1006
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,739
Scott: Those are the two things you have to do.

1007
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,540
Scott: And if you don't do those two things, then you can't complain because it's your fault.

1008
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,620
Scott: And if you do do those two things, you'll have a job and money.

1009
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:00,180
Rym: So what's your favorite mindless self-indulgence song?

1010
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,300
Scott: The only song I know they do is that bitch's song.

1011
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,679
Rym: That's also the only song I know.

1012
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,820
Rym: I thought I did, for all I knew, they were a joke band.

1013
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,559
Rym: They made one song.

1014
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:06,912
Scott: Yeah.

1015
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:08,098
Rym: And I liked that song.

1016
00:49:08,461 --> 00:49:09,459
Rym: But, uh, all right.

1017
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,559
Scott: Ram, are you still thinking about going to law school?

1018
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,518
Rym: See, I am.

1019
00:49:13,182 --> 00:49:13,678
Rym: I really am.

1020
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,019
Rym: And I was looking at taking the LSATs and I still think I got a new job.

1021
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,080
Rym: Well, here's the problem.

1022
00:49:18,902 --> 00:49:20,409
Rym: I just got a $20,000 raise by snapping my fingers.

1023
00:49:22,902 --> 00:49:25,780
Rym: And I discovered that I could have gotten a lot more money if I'd asked for it.

1024
00:49:26,082 --> 00:49:28,360
Rym: And I'm already bitter about that, but that's fine.

1025
00:49:29,002 --> 00:49:46,360
Rym: So if I can get a $20,000 raise by snapping my fingers and I expect to be able to get another $20,000 raise on top of that in the relatively near future by snapping my fingers again, I'd like to get a law degree, but I'd be better off just learning the law.

1026
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:46,831
Scott: Yeah.

1027
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:47,918
Rym: All right.

1028
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,220
Rym: On several shows, you talk about making grilled cheese sandwiches and adding dill to them.

1029
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,180
Rym: I've been craving grilled cheese sandwiches and thought of adding dill.

1030
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,819
Rym: Do you use dill seeds or dill weed?

1031
00:49:57,241 --> 00:50:28,077
Rym: What you want to do to make the perfect grilled cheese is first get a Calphalon pan or a good griddle, put some butter in it, let that butter melt, drop a piece of bread on that butter, drop your cheese on that bread, put dill on the cheese, spritz a little bit of water on the pan, cover the whole thing, steam it for like 15 seconds to melt the cheese, lift the thing up, put the other piece of bread on, put more butter down, flip it over, put some dill on the side that you just grilled, wait another, you know, however long it takes and then eat it.

1032
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,440
Rym: That's gonna be the best goddamn grilled cheese sandwich you've ever had.

1033
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,460
Scott: Best goddamn grilled cheese ever.

1034
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,139
Scott: Here's how it goes.

1035
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:32,460
Scott: Ready?

1036
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,199
Scott: Two pieces of whole wheat bread.

1037
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,060
Scott: Put some, rub some butter on both sides of each bread.

1038
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,600
Scott: Get some cheese, some nice sliced cheese.

1039
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,538
Rym: What kind of cheese?

1040
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:42,880
Scott: Oh, maybe some Kraft singles, maybe some Swiss.

1041
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,520
Rym: Ah, oh, Swiss is okay.

1042
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,860
Scott: Maybe some Swiss cheese, maybe some provolone cheese, something that melts.

1043
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,520
Rym: Honestly, the best cheese I believe to make a grilled cheese with is Monterey Jack.

1044
00:50:52,423 --> 00:50:54,258
Rym: Or at least like a Jack and something.

1045
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,760
Scott: The thing that I care about most though is that it's thinly sliced big pieces of cheese.

1046
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,500
Scott: I don't like it when you use like the little chunks of cheese.

1047
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,078
Scott: It doesn't work out.

1048
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,719
Scott: It's more difficult to melt.

1049
00:51:03,663 --> 00:51:04,539
Rym: That's why you steam it.

1050
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:05,880
Scott: I know, but here's the thing.

1051
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,780
Scott: Now you got to get the thin slices of cheese right from the deli.

1052
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,660
Scott: Deli sliced cheese.

1053
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:10,379
Rym: Or just grated.

1054
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,860
Rym: That's actually the best way.

1055
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:12,940
Scott: Grated is kind of okay.

1056
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,920
Scott: Then you get this clamp.

1057
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,200
Scott: I have this grilled cheese clamp.

1058
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,220
Scott: My parents have it anyway.

1059
00:51:16,562 --> 00:51:17,460
Rym: Eh, those are okay.

1060
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:18,920
Scott: Clamp is the best.

1061
00:51:19,061 --> 00:51:19,980
Rym: I've used the clamp before.

1062
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:20,400
Rym: You know what?

1063
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:21,640
Rym: I think the steam method is better.

1064
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,500
Scott: No, the clamp is superior.

1065
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,600
Scott: You put water in the clamp first of all, right?

1066
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,298
Scott: The clamps.

1067
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,940
Scott: And then you put the bread in the clamps.

1068
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,799
Rym: Are you saying that I should use these clamps?

1069
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,080
Rym: These clamps that I think about using every day of my life.

1070
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,140
Scott: Part of my body, right?

1071
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:43,300
Scott: You clamp the sandwich in the clamps and you put the clamp, put the cold clamp thing in hotness and you'll hold it there until the sandwiches and you flip it over while still holding it in the clamps until it's ready for eating.

1072
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,560
Rym: I point out that most delis in places that have good grilled cheeses, not paninis, but they just do it on the griddle though.

1073
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,260
Rym: They do it on the griddle with the steam method.

1074
00:51:50,866 --> 00:51:52,320
Rym: That's the best method to make a grilled cheese.

1075
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,200
Scott: That's an okay method.

1076
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,188
Scott: But yeah, use dill weed.

1077
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,379
Rym: Do not use dill seeds.

1078
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,919
Scott: Yeah, dill seeds are for pickles, right?

1079
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:01,020
Rym: Dill weed is good.

1080
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,660
Rym: A dash of oregano is really good.

1081
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:03,878
Scott: Okay, here we go.

1082
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,400
Scott: What superpowers would you pick?

1083
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:11,020
Scott: The easy answer to this question is all of them, right?

1084
00:52:11,522 --> 00:52:13,380
Scott: I'd just be like a wizard and I could do anything I wanted.

1085
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,580
Rym: That's why I would go one step further.

1086
00:52:15,821 --> 00:52:17,360
Rym: I would like to be able to cast spells.

1087
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:18,516
Rym: That's it.

1088
00:52:18,862 --> 00:52:21,880
Scott: Yeah, any spell I wanted and any number of times I wanted.

1089
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:31,440
Rym: If I had to be more specific overall, it would either be the ability to fly or if I can't have it in that, you know, rogue style, I can just kind of hover fly class A whatever.

1090
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:40,300
Rym: Then it would have to be the ability to transform my body because then I can grow wings if I want to fly or turn into a bird if I want to fly or turn into a snake if I want to slither.

1091
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:48,020
Scott: Yeah, if I had to pick something, you know, specific and not being able to use one of my cheap answers like everything or I'm a super powerful wizard, I would just pick teleport.

1092
00:52:48,447 --> 00:52:49,240
Scott: Teleport, teleport, teleport.

1093
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:50,159
Rym: I don't know.

1094
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:56,954
Scott: In terms of practicality, I think from a because then I would live in a giant house in the middle of nowhere that cost nothing because in the middle of nowhere.

1095
00:52:56,974 --> 00:53:00,319
Rym: from a purely practical teleport to work, I would choose time stop.

1096
00:53:01,249 --> 00:53:01,639
Scott: I don't know.

1097
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,979
Scott: Teleports better than time stop.

1098
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,938
Rym: No, because I would just cheat at Jeopardy and others.

1099
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,660
Rym: I would cheat at everything with time stop.

1100
00:53:08,821 --> 00:53:12,000
Rym: I could cheat with teleport to much more difficult.

1101
00:53:12,403 --> 00:53:13,659
Scott: I just had to cheat at different things.

1102
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:16,259
Rym: Yeah, much more difficult to get untraceable money that way.

1103
00:53:16,984 --> 00:53:17,740
Rym: Also, time stop.

1104
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:18,899
Scott: I go to a casino.

1105
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,810
Scott: I teleport under the table so quickly.

1106
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,500
Scott: no one notices and I can look at the cards.

1107
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,540
Rym: You can't see the cards.

1108
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,720
Rym: Have you ever been to a casino?

1109
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,659
Rym: It doesn't work that way.

1110
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,160
Scott: In the poker tournaments, they have these pieces of glass under the cards and the cameras.

1111
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:37,398
Scott: So you disappear for less than the amount of time that anyone would see because I teleport so fast.

1112
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:42,160
Rym: Physics, that's impossible because the amount of time it takes for the photons from the cards to get to your eyes.

1113
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,400
Scott: Fine, the superpower I'm picking.

1114
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,659
Scott: Teleport so fast.

1115
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:46,216
Rym: You know what?

1116
00:53:47,662 --> 00:53:48,520
Rym: Time stop is better.

1117
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:48,827
Scott: No.

1118
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:56,456
Rym: All right, this is a long question that I'm not even going to pretend to read, but he's asking about our thoughts on MST3K.

1119
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:57,560
Scott: It's awesome.

1120
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,060
Rym: It's great.

1121
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,860
Scott: I don't care about- Albert Vitti Permitty.

1122
00:54:02,003 --> 00:54:03,980
Rym: Did that sign just say Albert Vitti Permitty?

1123
00:54:04,681 --> 00:54:05,419
Scott: Vitti Permitty.

1124
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:08,679
Rym: To this day, God, I should Google it again.

1125
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:09,736
Rym: But, ugh.

1126
00:54:10,303 --> 00:54:10,368
Scott: Yep.

1127
00:54:11,044 --> 00:54:12,860
Scott: They're also asking about the riff tracks.

1128
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:19,098
Scott: Basically, the MST3K people, they make these audio files you can download from the internets and I think you have to pay for them.

1129
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,260
Scott: But you watch a movie and you play the MP3 at the same time.

1130
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,380
Rym: Cool idea, too much effort.

1131
00:54:23,622 --> 00:54:24,740
Scott: Cool idea, too much effort.

1132
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,780
Scott: I wouldn't pay for it.

1133
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,819
Scott: If it was free, I might do it.

1134
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:32,559
Scott: Or if someone sold the DVD with the riff track as the alternate audio track or something like that.

1135
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,979
Scott: Plus, it doesn't work if I don't have those little guys at the bottom of the screen moving around.

1136
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,378
Rym: All right, I'm going to do the following set of questions because they're all in the same format.

1137
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:41,920
Rym: It's one or the other and I'll read them all dramatic like.

1138
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,737
Rym: But the first one is more than two.

1139
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:49,720
Rym: Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein, or Frank Herbert?

1140
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,200
Scott: None of the above Jules Verne.

1141
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:52,719
Rym: All of the above and Jules Verne.

1142
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,900
Rym: Ozzy era Black Sabbath or Dio era Black Sabbath?

1143
00:54:58,146 --> 00:54:58,339
Rym: Ozzy.

1144
00:54:58,583 --> 00:54:58,776
Rym: Ozzy.

1145
00:54:59,983 --> 00:55:03,280
Rym: Are... Oh, this isn't one of those, never mind.

1146
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:08,640
Rym: Are either of you of the opinion that Reign of Blood is the only- Reign in Blood.

1147
00:55:08,801 --> 00:55:12,179
Rym: Reign in Blood is the only slayer one ever needs.

1148
00:55:13,506 --> 00:55:14,300
Scott: All the slayers good.

1149
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:16,780
Rym: I don't know what's from what album or anything.

1150
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,280
Rym: I just have a directory of Slayer.

1151
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,340
Rym: If I want to hear Slayer, I literally drag it and randomize it.

1152
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:21,876
Scott: That too.

1153
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,538
Rym: Have you ever been to a Wawa?

1154
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,840
Scott: Wawas are awesome.

1155
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,300
Scott: Let's not do a whole episode.

1156
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:29,320
Rym: I mean, Sea King, fuck yeah.

1157
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,078
Rym: No, Wawa.

1158
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,360
Scott: Fuck double yeah.

1159
00:55:32,081 --> 00:55:33,480
Rym: Do either of you like pork rolls?

1160
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,399
Rym: Pork rolls, pork buns.

1161
00:55:36,543 --> 00:55:37,360
Scott: That's good stuff.

1162
00:55:38,263 --> 00:55:39,460
Scott: What's your social security number?

1163
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,100
Rym: All right.

1164
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:40,500
Rym: 078-05-1120.

1165
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,320
Rym: Why does Scott never announce things of the day?

1166
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,800
Rym: Things of the day.

1167
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:47,700
Rym: Things of the day.

1168
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,159
Rym: Things of the day.

1169
00:55:49,566 --> 00:55:49,919
Scott: Thing of the day.

1170
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:53,199
Rym: Because I did it the first time and just Scott never did it.

1171
00:55:53,844 --> 00:55:54,080
Scott: All right.

1172
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:59,500
Scott: Do you think Japanese people ever get bored of watching zany competition shows and watch Western TV on the internet?

1173
00:55:59,621 --> 00:56:00,139
Scott: I don't think so.

1174
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:00,698
Scott: Why would you?

1175
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,680
Rym: I feel like Japanese TV is more of what I want in TV than American TV.

1176
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,260
Scott: But he's talking about Japanese people.

1177
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:10,694
Scott: Yeah, I know.

1178
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:14,115
Scott: If Japanese people wanted Western TV, trust me, they would watch it.

1179
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:16,199
Scott: I'm sure they do.

1180
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,680
Scott: They probably got some Simpson Seinfeld action going on over there.

1181
00:56:18,981 --> 00:56:19,256
Scott: I know.

1182
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,100
Rym: You know, I don't really know, honestly.

1183
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,139
Rym: Maybe Emily knows.

1184
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,036
Rym: Yes, they do.

1185
00:56:23,762 --> 00:56:25,018
Rym: They watch a lot of Western TV.

1186
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,880
Rym: Do they like Battlestar Galactica?

1187
00:56:27,823 --> 00:56:29,240
Rym: Yes, they like Battlestar Galactica.

1188
00:56:29,463 --> 00:56:29,779
Scott: All right.

1189
00:56:29,982 --> 00:56:31,479
Rym: Okay, we've got a resident expert here.

1190
00:56:32,361 --> 00:56:35,580
Scott: What was your initial reaction when you first encountered Leetspeak?

1191
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,180
Scott: What do you mean reaction?

1192
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,079
Scott: It was just natural.

1193
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:38,716
Rym: All right.

1194
00:56:39,722 --> 00:56:43,000
Rym: When I first saw Leetspeak, I was on Prodigy, right?

1195
00:56:43,722 --> 00:56:46,160
Rym: And obviously that was what the cool kids did, so I did it.

1196
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,800
Scott: Well, they did the alternating capital letters.

1197
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:54,540
Rym: Yes, that was early Leetspeak you realized was you start on a lowercase letter, you alternate uppercase lowercase.

1198
00:56:54,866 --> 00:56:55,318
Rym: That was it.

1199
00:56:56,001 --> 00:57:01,378
Scott: Yeah, and I didn't really have a reaction to it other than, "Hey, people on the internet who are cool are typing in a cool way to make it look

1200
00:57:01,399 --> 00:57:01,600
Scott: cool.".

1201
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,720
Scott: And then Where's People did it.

1202
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:07,696
Scott: And then when normal people started typing like the Where's People, I said, "Huh, I guess that's going to be around for a

1203
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:07,857
Scott: while.".

1204
00:57:08,245 --> 00:57:08,374
Rym: Yep.

1205
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:13,300
Rym: And I think the real story is I ended up deciding it was stupid.

1206
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,339
Rym: Then Megatokyo came around.

1207
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,600
Rym: Megatokyo made fun of Leetspeak in a way that made it awesome again.

1208
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:19,944
Rym: Yep.

1209
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:21,619
Rym: And now it's stupid again.

1210
00:57:22,002 --> 00:57:22,200
Rym: All right.

1211
00:57:22,761 --> 00:57:26,820
Scott: What are some of your favorite websites other than Digfark Slashtag related to tech anime gaming?

1212
00:57:27,062 --> 00:57:27,458
Scott: You know what?

1213
00:57:27,682 --> 00:57:28,730
Rym: I don't go to websites anymore.

1214
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:30,537
Rym: Not like that.

1215
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,418
Scott: Anime News Network.

1216
00:57:31,707 --> 00:57:31,837
Scott: Yeah.

1217
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,318
Scott: Go to Nintendo.com.

1218
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,276
Scott: Kotaku.

1219
00:57:35,005 --> 00:57:35,959
Rym: Uh, Fuckdig Slashdot.

1220
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:36,840
Scott: Engadget.

1221
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:37,758
Rym: You know what?

1222
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,700
Rym: I really, when I think about it, only go to blogs, news sites, and wikis.

1223
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,340
Scott: Boing boing.

1224
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:45,400
Scott: I go to the same websites everyone else goes to.

1225
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,858
Rym: Blogs, news sites, and wikis.

1226
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,120
Rym: I don't go to web sites anymore.

1227
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,160
Rym: I go to news or data aggregators.

1228
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:51,679
Rym: Pretty much.

1229
00:57:51,881 --> 00:57:53,000
Rym: Like the idea of a website.

1230
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,080
Rym: I don't go to anyone's personal website ever.

1231
00:57:56,163 --> 00:57:58,600
Rym: All right, we've heard about podcasts you hate.

1232
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,480
Rym: What are some you like related to tech anime gaming?

1233
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,379
Rym: We already answered this.

1234
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,400
Rym: Well, specifically tech anime gaming.

1235
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:05,375
Rym: I do listen to Twit.

1236
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,879
Scott: Yeah, I listen to Twit.

1237
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,220
Rym: The only anime pod- I'm sorry to all of our friend podcasters in anime.

1238
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:19,560
Rym: I'm of the opinion that the only anime podcasts that are really good are GeekNights, Anime World Order, Dave and Joel's Fast Karate for the Gentlemen.

1239
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:20,419
Scott: That's it.

1240
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:21,219
Rym: That's pretty much it.

1241
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,680
Rym: Gaming, Dave and Joel's Fast Karate for the Gentlemen.

1242
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,397
Scott: That's pretty much it.

1243
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:30,560
Scott: I used to listen to a video game podcast I complain about all the time, but there aren't any good video game podcasts anymore.

1244
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:31,980
Rym: Ooh, I like the next question.

1245
00:58:32,241 --> 00:58:35,900
Scott: And a lot of people sent me suggestions like, "Oh, you gotta listen to this gaming podcast.

1246
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,520
Scott: Oh, you gotta listen to this gaming podcast.

1247
00:58:37,621 --> 00:58:38,199
Scott: These are good ones.

1248
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:38,686
Scott: They all

1249
00:58:38,747 --> 00:58:39,013
Scott: sucked.".

1250
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:43,580
Rym: All right, let's do up until the- let's do the next five questions and end it.

1251
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:43,956
Rym: All right.

1252
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,920
Rym: Because I think the next question is really good and it'll go a while, and the rest are really short but really great.

1253
00:58:49,148 --> 00:58:49,519
Rym: All right.

1254
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,059
Scott: What is your goal in life?

1255
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:53,140
Scott: I mean, really, what are you guys going to do with your lives?

1256
00:58:53,221 --> 00:58:56,300
Scott: I don't have a particular goal, like a big goal.

1257
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,480
Scott: Like, "Aha, I've achieved it.

1258
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:58,420
Scott: My life is complete.

1259
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,275
Scott: Now I have nothing left to

1260
00:58:59,316 --> 00:58:59,398
Scott: do.".

1261
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:04,140
Scott: Because if I ever achieve that sort of finality in my life, might as well just kill myself.

1262
00:59:05,724 --> 00:59:10,060
Scott: So my goal is just always get to better than what I've got now.

1263
00:59:10,161 --> 00:59:18,279
Scott: And even if I was like the richest person in the world, in a castle, in space, and at everything I wanted, I would still want something more.

1264
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:22,379
Rym: I guess overweening ambition is the same thing.

1265
00:59:23,124 --> 00:59:30,933
Rym: Although not quite hubris, not the, you know, "I will cast down the gods from the skies and recreate them in my own image, for I am he who has spoke the

1266
00:59:30,953 --> 00:59:31,216
Rym: world.".

1267
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:38,079
Rym: But I just better, faster, stronger, more than ever, hour after.

1268
00:59:38,681 --> 00:59:39,080
Rym: Something like that.

1269
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:47,957
Rym: Seriously, I can never see a point where I would be able to have completed my goals in life, because I will always think, "Could I do

1270
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:48,259
Rym: more?".

1271
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:58,100
Scott: I guess my goal in life is get ahead as much as I can, in the direction I want to go, as much as I can before I inevitably die.

1272
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,619
Scott: Unless I can avoid dying.

1273
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,980
Rym: I want to have the most impact, good impact on the world that I can.

1274
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,980
Rym: I want to be such that I am constantly peaking.

1275
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,900
Rym: That everything I do is a peak experience.

1276
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,300
Rym: That everything I have achieved is greater than that I have achieved before.

1277
01:00:14,164 --> 01:00:15,980
Rym: That I will never retire.

1278
01:00:16,181 --> 01:00:18,580
Rym: I will pursue my goals until death.

1279
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:27,860
Scott: Well, I might retire in the sense that my, you know, main source of income is no longer like a primary full-time occupation, and now I'm collecting social security and other monies to live on, but...

1280
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,715
Rym: I will never be a sedentary person.

1281
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,280
Scott: I wouldn't be living in Florida playing shuffleboard all day, that's for sure.

1282
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:40,739
Rym: So in a more literal sense, we're gonna try to make GeekNights the biggest it can possibly be, and we're gonna do a lot of other things.

1283
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,059
Scott: We can do everything we can and everything we want to.

1284
01:00:43,361 --> 01:00:46,980
Rym: Do you pre-record "Let's Do This" at the beginning of every episode?

1285
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:49,280
Scott: It's pre-recorded, it hasn't changed in like forever.

1286
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,359
Rym: Or do you have a QUI?

1287
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:51,300
Rym: No.

1288
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,260
Scott: I think they meant to say Q, but they don't know how to spell it.

1289
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,239
Rym: Q is spelled awesomely, and if you spell it wrong, I hate you.

1290
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,336
Scott: Q-U-E-U-E.

1291
01:00:57,961 --> 01:00:58,330
Scott: Not Q-U-E.

1292
01:00:59,402 --> 01:01:01,237
Scott: At least this kind of Q actually should be C-U-E.

1293
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,714
Rym: Yeah, so you're a horrible person.

1294
01:01:03,734 --> 01:01:04,319
Rym: whoever wrote that.

1295
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,839
Scott: To keep it simple, I'm gonna just ask for your opinion of a few things.

1296
01:01:08,521 --> 01:01:10,080
Scott: Action figures and the guys who collect them.

1297
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,680
Rym: If you have one or two awesome action figures, that's awesome.

1298
01:01:12,983 --> 01:01:14,420
Rym: If you have a collection, you're scary.

1299
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,300
Scott: If you go to Toys"R"Us every week, scary.

1300
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,068
Scott: Bears.

1301
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,499
Rym: You can't be a bear.

1302
01:01:19,201 --> 01:01:20,899
Scott: How do you type with boxing gloves on?

1303
01:01:21,361 --> 01:01:22,600
Rym: Uh, dragon naturally speaking.

1304
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:23,399
Scott: Very carefully.

1305
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,379
Rym: Have you ever seen the 1970s action classic "Fuck Yes, The Warriors"?

1306
01:01:29,765 --> 01:01:30,437
Scott: No, I haven't.

1307
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,330
Scott: I never even heard of it before.

1308
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:33,540
Scott: there was a video game about it.

1309
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:35,260
Scott: We talked about this days ago.

1310
01:01:35,322 --> 01:01:36,220
Scott: I know, but I- What the fuck?

1311
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,819
Rym: 'Cause I gotta be up in your grill now.

1312
01:01:39,524 --> 01:01:40,160
Scott: The Warriors.

1313
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,157
Scott: It came out in the 70s, I was born in '82.

1314
01:01:43,362 --> 01:01:46,320
Rym: The Warriors is one of the best movies ever made.

1315
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,179
Scott: Some I don't think so.

1316
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,520
Rym: No, no, seriously.

1317
01:01:49,004 --> 01:01:49,939
Rym: It's a dumb movie.

1318
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,340
Scott: It's not a good movie.

1319
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:54,300
Scott: So why did you say it was one of the best ever made?

1320
01:01:54,300 --> 01:02:06,300
Rym: Because the way it's done, and the plot, and the costumes, and the scene where the gang with the baseball... That movie is just... That movie is to me what Robocop is to Dave Riley.

1321
01:02:07,526 --> 01:02:08,720
Scott: Have you ever been in a fist fight?

1322
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,620
Scott: Did you ever get jumped or jump someone?

1323
01:02:10,701 --> 01:02:15,760
Scott: Well, back in the public school days, you know, mostly elementary and middle school, you'd fight all the time with kids.

1324
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,700
Rym: I was in three fist fights in middle school.

1325
01:02:17,902 --> 01:02:18,759
Rym: I won two of them.

1326
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,979
Scott: Yeah, I almost choked a kid until he passed out, but then someone made me let go.

1327
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,000
Rym: I broke a kid's nose and almost broke his jaw with two punches.

1328
01:02:26,762 --> 01:02:28,540
Scott: Yeah, but that's what kids do, they fight.

1329
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,700
Rym: He attacked me first and he was kind of a prick.

1330
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:33,260
Scott: Since adulthood, no more fighting.

1331
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,139
Rym: I was almost attacked by that crazy guy.

1332
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:40,100
Rym: Someone tried to mug me once in Detroit, but that didn't... They were kind of meek and nothing happened.

1333
01:02:40,284 --> 01:02:41,000
Rym: It wasn't a fight.

1334
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:43,439
Rym: He just kind of... I walked away and he didn't do anything.

1335
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,379
Scott: Which is the best?

1336
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,978
Scott: Big knife, tarantula, or limousine?

1337
01:02:48,701 --> 01:02:50,779
Rym: Let's just answer the next question because it's the same thing.

1338
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,800
Scott: Have either of you really gotten into Homestar Runner?

1339
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,260
Scott: I was listening to Homestar Runner when you...

1340
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:57,800
Rym: I was raised by a cop.

1341
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,619
Scott: Weren't even a twinkle in your daddy's eye.

1342
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:00,640
Rym: Anybody this way.

1343
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:04,140
Rym: Not to toot our own horn in terms of being on top of the internet.

1344
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,480
Rym: We were watching Homestar when there were like seven strong bad emails.

1345
01:03:09,261 --> 01:03:15,020
Scott: I'm pretty sure the first strong bad email where his computer explodes is a result of my email.

1346
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,838
Scott: Even though I can't prove it, I'm pretty sure it is.

1347
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,300
Rym: The front row crew at RIT got super into Homestar.

1348
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:20,798
Rym: You know what?

1349
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,559
Scott: We discovered it.

1350
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,419
Scott: We were super into it.

1351
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,539
Scott: It was our favorite thing in the world.

1352
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:25,520
Scott: And then it was the same joke over and over again.

1353
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,240
Scott: And it got old and we stopped paying attention to it.

1354
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,119
Scott: But we still respect it.

1355
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,960
Rym: I've been done with Homestar for many years and I don't find it funny anymore.

1356
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,880
Rym: But the original ones I still find hilarious.

1357
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,120
Scott: Yeah, I mean I could look at it from time to time and still find something to enjoy in there.

1358
01:03:39,744 --> 01:03:41,160
Scott: But I'm largely done with it.

1359
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:46,120
Rym: I think the final glory of Homestar Runner was when the computer exploded.

1360
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:46,512
Scott: Yep.

1361
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:47,958
Rym: And that was a long time ago.

1362
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,439
Scott: Trogdor was sort of the final glory.

1363
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,516
Rym: Trogdor, oh man.

1364
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,999
Rym: Coach Z's got money, but not much.

1365
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,618
Rym: When Dave Zader, you know what it is?

1366
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:56,697
Rym: I'll tell you right now.

1367
01:03:57,201 --> 01:04:00,640
Rym: The peak and end of Homestar Runner was the Homestar Runner CD.

1368
01:04:01,121 --> 01:04:01,700
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

1369
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,259
Rym: That was the funniest thing ever.

1370
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,320
Scott: When the first music CD came out, that was the business.

1371
01:04:05,984 --> 01:04:08,700
Rym: Oh my, I listened to that CD in a non-ironic way.

1372
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:09,859
Rym: And I'm not kidding.

1373
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:10,619
Scott: Not kidding either.

1374
01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:12,699
Scott: I karaoked that CD.

1375
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,900
Rym: Alright, following from that.

1376
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:17,140
Rym: That doesn't follow at all.

1377
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:20,020
Rym: Who would win in a fight, Rym or Scott?

1378
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,160
Scott: It depends on the kind of fight.

1379
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:27,680
Rym: I imagine if it was some sort of- Let's say right now, we just fight right now exactly with what we've got.

1380
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,640
Scott: What kind of rules are there?

1381
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,979
Rym: No rules, but to the death.

1382
01:04:30,483 --> 01:04:31,399
Scott: I'd probably win.

1383
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:32,219
Rym: I think I would win.

1384
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,280
Scott: Because I would resort to weapons and dirty tricks first.

1385
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,239
Rym: You think I wouldn't?

1386
01:04:35,643 --> 01:04:37,820
Scott: Yeah, I think you wouldn't do it as effectively as I could.

1387
01:04:38,303 --> 01:04:39,740
Rym: If I knew I was fighting to the death.

1388
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:44,720
Rym: If it's some hypothetical situation where it's just a pure- Like, say it's a VR simulation.

1389
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,319
Rym: We're just gonna fight to the death right now.

1390
01:04:47,443 --> 01:04:48,620
Rym: I'm a lot stronger than Scott.

1391
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,060
Scott: Stronger doesn't matter.

1392
01:04:50,181 --> 01:04:50,920
Scott: I do dirty things.

1393
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,577
Scott: Like, I'll bite you.

1394
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:53,740
Scott: I'd go for the eyes.

1395
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,840
Scott: I'd go for the crotch.

1396
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,079
Scott: I'd go for the weapons.

1397
01:04:56,901 --> 01:04:58,239
Rym: I've also studied martial arts.

1398
01:04:58,581 --> 01:05:00,380
Rym: And there is something that I- You studied martial arts.

1399
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,439
Scott: You took Kung Fu class at RIT for like ten weeks.

1400
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,039
Rym: You know what?

1401
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:05,460
Rym: Front through the heart leg kick is not hard to do.

1402
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,839
Scott: Yeah, I took karate for more than ten weeks when I was a kid.

1403
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:08,398
Scott: So take that.

1404
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,240
Rym: Yeah, we'll see how well you do in a fight.

1405
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:11,440
Rym: Plus, I got more weapons nearby.

1406
01:05:12,101 --> 01:05:13,160
Scott: I got some weapons over here.

1407
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:17,040
Rym: I got some metal scissors and a screwdriver and a harmonica.

1408
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,680
Scott: Plus, I would be so fast downstairs to where the knives are.

1409
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,359
Scott: You have no idea.

1410
01:05:23,529 --> 01:05:23,840
Rym: I don't know.

1411
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,780
Rym: I think I would win in a fight.

1412
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,020
Scott: And we already proved that I'm better with knives than you are.

1413
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:27,960
Scott: You cut yourself, I don't.

1414
01:05:29,602 --> 01:05:31,520
Rym: But I guess that means that I have more skill in cutting.

1415
01:05:32,486 --> 01:05:33,017
Scott: Uh, I guess.

1416
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:35,659
Rym: In cutting people, I have more experience than you.

1417
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,060
Scott: Yeah, too bad I'm stab proof.

1418
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:37,396
Scott: Okay.

1419
01:05:38,061 --> 01:05:38,417
Rym: All right.

1420
01:05:39,386 --> 01:05:40,138
Rym: Ooh, this is a good one.

1421
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:43,258
Rym: You guys are always saying, "Oh, have we got a story about

1422
01:05:43,298 --> 01:05:43,460
Rym: that?".

1423
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,719
Rym: What's the best FRC story you haven't told yet?

1424
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:46,457
Scott: I don't know.

1425
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:50,040
Scott: Because if I would think of a story I haven't told, I would fucking tell it.

1426
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:56,480
Rym: No, I can think of a couple that we don't tell because they would either be extremely embarrassing to someone or are really long or really personal.

1427
01:05:56,561 --> 01:05:57,137
Scott: Like which ones?

1428
01:05:57,504 --> 01:05:57,800
Rym: I don't know.

1429
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:00,999
Rym: Ones involving certain relationships that certain people got into.

1430
01:06:01,987 --> 01:06:03,319
Rym: Maybe the crew didn't approve of.

1431
01:06:04,282 --> 01:06:05,599
Rym: Maybe that person was a shrew.

1432
01:06:06,465 --> 01:06:06,818
Rym: I don't know.

1433
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:07,316
Rym: That one.

1434
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:08,120
Scott: Okay.

1435
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:11,756
Rym: There's also a bunch involving people that... I don't know.

1436
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:14,940
Scott: Currently, how well do you get along with your parents and siblings?

1437
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:15,520
Rym: Just fine.

1438
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:15,857
Scott: Fine.

1439
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,500
Rym: Do you ever see yourself running for office?

1440
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,340
Rym: Why or why not?

1441
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,254
Rym: Honestly...

1442
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:21,614
Scott: Maybe.

1443
01:06:22,848 --> 01:06:23,320
Rym: Uh, yeah.

1444
01:06:23,745 --> 01:06:24,220
Rym: In the future.

1445
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:30,379
Rym: I was seriously thinking about running for local office, but I don't disagree with the local government at all.

1446
01:06:31,043 --> 01:06:32,379
Rym: Except on things that I couldn't change.

1447
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,220
Scott: Would I ever want to be a congressman?

1448
01:06:34,521 --> 01:06:35,059
Rym: Hells yes.

1449
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,240
Scott: Probably.

1450
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,080
Scott: It would be fun at least for one time.

1451
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,380
Scott: If it sucked, I would just quit.

1452
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,278
Rym: For one time.

1453
01:06:40,543 --> 01:06:41,080
Rym: It's permanent.

1454
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,219
Rym: You can't get thrown out.

1455
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:43,667
Scott: No, I meant for one term.

1456
01:06:46,561 --> 01:06:48,519
Scott: And if I didn't... Just, you know, because why not?

1457
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:59,520
Scott: You know, if everything that I think about it, like it's corrupt and no matter what I do, I can't break to fix the system, then I would get probably demoralized and quit or do something crazy and then quit.

1458
01:06:59,704 --> 01:07:00,397
Scott: Let me put it this way.

1459
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,579
Scott: Get kicked out.

1460
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:03,520
Rym: They say, you know, Sword of Damocles and all.

1461
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,620
Rym: I don't think you understand American politics.

1462
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:12,659
Rym: The Sword of Damocles has been raised by the bag full of money of Damocles and it always falls.

1463
01:07:13,641 --> 01:07:21,999
Rym: Once you are elected to the federal government as the president or a member of Congress, you are set for life and nothing bad can happen to you.

1464
01:07:22,761 --> 01:07:23,960
Scott: Even if you do horrible crimes.

1465
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,700
Rym: No matter what you do, nothing bad can happen to you, period.

1466
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:27,778
Rym: Like seriously.

1467
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:29,900
Rym: There is no Sword of Damocles at all.

1468
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:39,360
Scott: Yeah, I guess I would want to be that to get, you know, some of the things that go along with it, but I don't know if I'd actually want to, you know, like, you know, legislate for a good portion of my life.

1469
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,620
Scott: I don't know if I'd actually want to deal with all that bullshit.

1470
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:42,640
Rym: All right.

1471
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,720
Rym: Let's do two more questions and we'll be done.

1472
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,700
Scott: Are there any situations in which you'd prefer a bench trial over a jury trial?

1473
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,620
Scott: Well, if I felt that the jury was not going to rule in my favor and that the judge was...

1474
01:07:56,581 --> 01:08:03,719
Rym: I think more to the point, I hate to say this, but at least in New York State down here, I've seen how jury selection works.

1475
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:15,720
Rym: And once I learned that no one with a, with any sort of job can get, can be on a jury at all, I do not want the people who end up on a jury to be judging me in any way at all.

1476
01:08:15,821 --> 01:08:17,720
Rym: And I would almost always prefer a judge.

1477
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:18,420
Scott: Yeah.

1478
01:08:18,481 --> 01:08:18,840
Scott: Seriously.

1479
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:29,120
Scott: I hope the judge, you know, the thing is if the judge is some old man and it's like some computer trial or something, and he doesn't know anything about computers, then I guess it's a choice between two equal evils.

1480
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:33,220
Rym: The one bench trial I ever had, the judge said case dismissed before I said anything.

1481
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:33,696
Rym: Yeah.

1482
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:34,997
Rym: So, all right.

1483
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,919
Rym: Last question, because I think the answer is the same for both of us.

1484
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:38,580
Rym: All right.

1485
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,700
Rym: You can see one concert from any artist band in history, Led Zeppelin.

1486
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,099
Scott: Well, they are doing that one concert, but...

1487
01:08:46,362 --> 01:08:47,340
Rym: It's not the same.

1488
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:48,518
Rym: There's no John Bono.

1489
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:51,240
Scott: Yeah, like go back in time, see Led Zeppelin.

1490
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,300
Scott: But I don't know, go back in time, see Mozart.

1491
01:08:54,661 --> 01:08:56,439
Rym: No, no, you don't want to.

1492
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,140
Rym: Instruments back then sucked and the music sounded like crap.

1493
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,540
Scott: You're sure about that?

1494
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,299
Rym: Let me put it this way.

1495
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:04,640
Rym: The way instruments worked back then is not the way it worked now.

1496
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:12,540
Rym: And while it could have sounded good, it, the tone of those instruments, because we've recreated those instruments in modern times, they don't sound that good.

1497
01:09:14,344 --> 01:09:17,740
Rym: Also, because of the way, I mean, Mozart, he wrote down his music.

1498
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:22,840
Rym: We can play it, we're pretty sure, as well as it would ever have been played.

1499
01:09:22,939 --> 01:09:29,300
Rym: And it's not going to be, you would have to be one fricking audio file in the real sense of the word, I guess music, music file.

1500
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:34,479
Scott: Well then, equivalent with Zeppelin, I will also say Hendrix, because, you know, I guess...

1501
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:35,380
Rym: There's no good recordings?

1502
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:47,760
Scott: Yeah, all the, because, well, then at that point in time, in like the 60s, we had excellent electric guitars and instruments, but the recording technology was terrible and Hendrix died, so we don't have any terribly good recordings of what it sounded like.

1503
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:53,120
Rym: Unless theoretically, we go out into space, and from far away, we measure...

1504
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:54,940
Scott: It's sound waves, not light, it's not in space.

1505
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:01,500
Rym: And then we measure the quantum state of the Earth, and from that we predict the past, and then we recreate the audio that was Hendrix.

1506
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,140
Scott: Yeah, great.

1507
01:10:02,801 --> 01:10:04,060
Rym: We can also get that Nazi signal.

1508
01:10:04,682 --> 01:10:04,979
Scott: Yeah, great.

1509
01:10:05,527 --> 01:10:05,759
Rym: All right.

1510
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,240
Rym: It's been over an hour, I think we're done.

1511
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:09,380
Rym: I hope you enjoyed...

1512
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,060
Scott: Wow, we got a lot of fucking questions left here.

1513
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:20,679
Rym: I hope you enjoyed questions week, there will be probably questions weeks two and three in the semi-near future, because it's not hard for us to do this, and you guys asked a lot of questions.

1514
01:10:22,145 --> 01:10:23,440
Scott: Yep, I don't know what else there is to say.

1515
01:10:23,942 --> 01:10:25,020
Rym: I'm gonna go cook some dinner.

1516
01:10:25,681 --> 01:10:27,700
Scott: I'm gonna go push buttons on computers.
