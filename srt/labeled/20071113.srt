1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,589
Rym: It's Tuesday November 13th.

2
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,472
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,719
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,160
Rym: tonight Scott finally airs all his grievances against achievement.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:29,923
Scott: Let's do this Well yesterday.

6
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:35,040
Rym: We talked about the chairs that we've been waiting for and they weren't here when we got home.

7
00:00:35,722 --> 00:00:41,851
Rym: So we're sitting in the living room talking about how much we want our chairs to come and you know I guess nominally I was really talking about mostly you.

8
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:44,889
Rym: oh Excited if you don't want your chair.

9
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:45,673
Rym: I'll take it well.

10
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:45,914
Scott: No.

11
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:46,336
Scott: It's you know.

12
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:49,600
Scott: I'm not really From ordering so many things online.

13
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:50,949
Scott: I know a lot of people that you know.

14
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:59,440
Scott: I've had the feeling in the past You know where you buy something online or you you know that someone mailed you something, and you're just anticipating it showing up.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,489
Scott: You're like oh, man.

16
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:01,720
Scott: I can't wait for it to show up.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,136
Scott: I'm gonna get home to be a package or oh man something's gonna show up and sometimes for certain packages I still get it.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,080
Scott: You know like my Mario Galaxy should be coming this week or early next week from Amazon.

19
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:21,360
Scott: I'm kind of anticipating that but I no longer like get really excited when a package is coming because I get so many packages because I buy everything online that I can buy.

20
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,232
Rym: I see wasn't that it was more because this wasn't just a package.

21
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:27,560
Rym: from what we were told we'd have to be here.

22
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:33,809
Rym: We'd have to arrange it ahead of time like they'd email me and then FedEx is gonna come and Scott will stay home and sign forward or something.

23
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:38,152
Rym: and We they hadn't called us yet, so I'm wondering alright.

24
00:01:38,553 --> 00:01:39,296
Rym: Are they gonna call?

25
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:40,220
Rym: are they not shipped him yet?

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,044
Rym: When are they gonna get here?

27
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:56,300
Rym: What's going on, and we're talking a minute and a Couple hours later you in the living room playing Lego Star Wars about to come up and do the show And I just kind of notice out the big Gigantic sliding glass door in our living room that goes to the back porch.

28
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:05,244
Rym: two gigantic Packages that have been sitting there obviously all day that neither one of us had noticed until just then I don't know.

29
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:06,409
Scott: They might have been there all day.

30
00:02:06,449 --> 00:02:07,935
Scott: They might not have been it who knows?

31
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:09,545
Rym: um they were there I don't know.

32
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:10,580
Scott: They could have showed up at it.

33
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:12,185
Scott: You didn't see them before.

34
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:15,755
Scott: they could have showed up literally like a minute before you notice.

35
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,784
Rym: um FedEx doesn't deliver that late I don't know.

36
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:20,268
Scott: No they don't who knows when.

37
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:25,305
Rym: I know when they were obviously there when we all got home And none of us look out there.

38
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:26,630
Rym: cuz now it's cold out.

39
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,059
Scott: We don't go on the back porch, but not necessarily true.

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,764
Rym: Okay, there's no way Scott.

41
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,191
Rym: You know FedEx won't deliver anything after like five.

42
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:34,632
Rym: No.

43
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:49,852
Scott: I've had packages show up at 7. aha yeah Anyway the point is is that they were there And we brought him in the house, and we're starting to open him up and you have these gigantic boxes almost as big as well maybe half as big as refrigerator boxes, maybe a quarter of the size.

44
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:51,799
Scott: so really big big enough you could get inside of them.

45
00:02:51,819 --> 00:03:02,660
Scott: and I open mine up And I'm like hey Cuz the guy at the store told me you take the wheels and you put the piston on the wheels and you put chair on The piston and I didn't see any piston piece.

46
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:12,220
Scott: I mean there was a thing in the middle of the wheels that stuck up and might have been a piston But it looked really small, and it didn't look like it would telescope enough to be the piston.

47
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,034
Rym: So I says I says to Scott are you sure that isn't it?

48
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:16,260
Rym: and he says look at it.

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,025
Rym: This can't be it.

50
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:17,669
Rym: It won't work.

51
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,420
Scott: I didn't look like it was it to me?

52
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,788
Scott: I was pretty sure it wasn't it.

53
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:22,792
Scott: and you know I'm going.

54
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:24,640
Scott: I'm looking around that it was no other pieces.

55
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:28,371
Rym: Now we probably wouldn't have been as confused except yesterday.

56
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:35,140
Rym: I got a phone call and the people were just like There's a note on your invoice that says piston.

57
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,474
Rym: Do you know what that's all about?

58
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:36,919
Rym: and I said?

59
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:40,694
Rym: I think one of the chairs comes with a piston.

60
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,820
Rym: I don't know why you calling me.

61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,683
Rym: I ordered the thing.

62
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:45,093
Scott: yeah, this is obviously the guy who sold us.

63
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:46,800
Scott: these chairs obviously know what was going on.

64
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,970
Rym: He knew the score, but and he went on vacation apparently the next day.

65
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:53,719
Scott: well apparently whoever talked to Rym had no clue What was going on?

66
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,945
Scott: And this is this is a problem.

67
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,219
Scott: people should not be doing work that they do not know how to do.

68
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:04,388
Scott: so apparently these people had no clue what they were doing and So they didn't know what that note meant or anything.

69
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:05,853
Scott: and they're calling us to find out.

70
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:09,071
Scott: call the dude that's on vacation That's he knows.

71
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:09,596
Scott: we don't know.

72
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:21,738
Scott: So the fact that they called and mentioned something about the piston and then I got the chair And it didn't look like there was the piston I was like huh it kind of puts that seed of doubt in your mind.

73
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:27,376
Rym: like Way back in the day I got a text message out of the blue, and I don't get text messages ever.

74
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:28,360
Rym: I hadn't even used it.

75
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,366
Rym: It was on my old cell phone.

76
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:31,520
Rym: even so my phone makes a weird noise that look.

77
00:04:31,986 --> 00:04:33,020
Rym: And there's a text message.

78
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:40,738
Rym: I can't see who it was from and it just says don't eat And I'm sitting there, and I had just bought a doughnut and the doughnut was sitting in front of me.

79
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:44,292
Rym: and for a second I thought is this doughnut poisoned what?

80
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,276
Scott: that's what I would think.

81
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:46,139
Scott: how would they even know?

82
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:47,523
Rym: Is this what?

83
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:48,425
Rym: was this the matrix?

84
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:49,168
Rym: What's going on?

85
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,160
Rym: that seed of doubt was planted by an unrelated event yep?

86
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:54,980
Scott: So we had the seed of doubt.

87
00:04:55,101 --> 00:05:05,226
Scott: But I went online into the website of the chair And there was a manual and looking at the manual and that mostly the service and repair manual which is great that they put online And they damn well better for the price.

88
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:05,708
Rym: Well.

89
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:06,491
Rym: I mean think about it.

90
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:12,156
Scott: It's not like you can pirate the chair That's true, but yeah, they don't let you get service and repair manuals for cars.

91
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:13,000
Scott: Let's pay a lot of money.

92
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:14,305
Rym: Well, that's because it's a racket.

93
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:21,795
Scott: it is a racket however in the service and repair manual I saw no such part as the is the parts and service manual I think.

94
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,244
Scott: and in all the parts section I didn't see any parts.

95
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:25,187
Scott: that looked like a piston.

96
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:30,126
Scott: so I went and I put the chair on and it Telescoped crazily.

97
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:33,720
Scott: it goes so high my feet are off the ground, and I'm like oh, I guess it's fine.

98
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:41,440
Rym: So I am now podcasting to you semi live from my brand new solid black metal throne with a pellicle seat.

99
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,956
Scott: It's not all metal it is significant.

100
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:45,720
Scott: parts plastic.

101
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,469
Rym: Well a few parts are but the bottom parts metal.

102
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,472
Rym: the middle parts metal.

103
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:52,924
Rym: all the bits are metal and the rest is pellicle Or plastic.

104
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:56,515
Scott: yep, it is that pellicle is just plastic meshy stuff.

105
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:57,659
Rym: Yeah, but it's special.

106
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,839
Rym: Kinda my butt can breathe.

107
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:06,819
Scott: You're wearing pants, so your butt can really only breathe if you took the pants off and then sat in the chair.

108
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,688
Rym: ah That'll come later.

109
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:13,613
Scott: Yeah Anyway, let's talk about games of some sort.

110
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:18,337
Rym: so instead of a news I figure I should do a geek bite because you don't have any news.

111
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,699
Rym: well No, I had a few news.

112
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:25,393
Rym: They're not worth talking about and more importantly It's a game that we're never gonna review fully because there's no reason to.

113
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:27,180
Rym: I think we can cover it all right now.

114
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,256
Rym: All right Scott picked up the other day Lego Star Wars for the week.

115
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:42,100
Scott: it includes Star Wars complete saga for the week because there was previously Lego Star Wars and then Lego Star Wars again And it was episodes 1 2 3 and then 4 5 6. or was it 4 5 6 1 2 3?

116
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,052
Scott: I don't know, but this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 on one disc for the week.

117
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:47,929
Rym: It's everything and it works, and it works.

118
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:52,806
Rym: yes, and Lego Star Wars is not Really a game.

119
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:55,794
Rym: I mean it's a game in the same sense that gauntlet is a game.

120
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:57,940
Rym: Yeah, but there's no puzzles.

121
00:06:58,102 --> 00:06:59,959
Rym: You're not gonna have to figure anything out.

122
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,336
Scott: Basically amount to use the force on every single thing.

123
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:08,800
Scott: you see you know It's basically you walk around a level and your widgets to push.

124
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:19,870
Scott: You know like it's like switches on all the walls and all you to do if you push every switch on every wall that you can possibly push and Activate everything you can possibly activate which occasionally requires.

125
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,160
Scott: do you know activating things in a certain order or an occasionally requires?

126
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,013
Scott: You know pushing a block onto some switches or something, but nothing it's.

127
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:28,836
Scott: it's e10.

128
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,020
Scott: ten-year-olds can play this game.

129
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,205
Rym: All right, you know what it's like.

130
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:35,909
Rym: this game is like those rides at carnivals Where it looks like the pirate rod.

131
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,679
Rym: you go in and you got a little gun?

132
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:45,535
Rym: And you can shoot at all these targets and every time you hit a target Something happens like the pirate jumps out and goes it was it was it.

133
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:47,022
Scott: that's exactly what this game Is.

134
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:49,579
Rym: the skeleton falls over in a bunch of pieces and then?

135
00:07:50,384 --> 00:08:00,515
Scott: If you hit the nail on the head it's like all those shooting galleries where you have a gun and it's sort of like a laser gun and you shoot at these targets and When you hit a target it activates some animatronic thing for a second.

136
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:02,904
Scott: that does something funny And it's that it's that.

137
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:04,128
Scott: but it's Star Wars.

138
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:09,629
Rym: and now don't be turned off by that because while this is a game for kids And while there's not much gameplay.

139
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:14,893
Rym: I like those rides And as a result, I like this game.

140
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:15,718
Scott: this game is okay.

141
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:23,360
Scott: I mean you might get bored if you keep if you actually try to unlock all this because basically the game is like collecting gold.

142
00:08:23,742 --> 00:08:26,776
Scott: But you there's so much gold everywhere, but you have to collect so much of it.

143
00:08:26,837 --> 00:08:27,480
Scott: It's just crazy.

144
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,880
Scott: So just don't don't even bother Yeah If you ignore that stuff and just try to burn through the game and do is do all the funny things that you can do.

145
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:42,754
Scott: you know watch all the funny cutscenes and Make all the funny situations you can by mixing Star Wars characters together in interesting ways.

146
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,138
Scott: and you know unlock.

147
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:48,020
Scott: some of the things Are worth unlocking like I unlocked this Lego town.

148
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:52,660
Scott: So you go around the perfectly normal happy Lego town, but I'm Darth Maul and I'm destroying it.

149
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,664
Scott: That was good times.

150
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,734
Rym: Scott did that for a while.

151
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:56,780
Scott: Yeah now I'm done with that.

152
00:08:57,322 --> 00:09:02,440
Scott: It expected me to do it until I got a million gold because every time you destroy stuff like a zillion gold falls out.

153
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:07,520
Scott: He got over 500,000 gold and then I gave up because I was like fuck this.

154
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:11,529
Rym: I mean, that's really it that I think the greatest joy in this game is.

155
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:17,299
Rym: Whenever I'm a Jedi and Scott's not a Jedi I can randomly just force choke him and then kill him.

156
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,927
Rym: There's nothing he can do about it.

157
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:19,570
Scott: You can't do that.

158
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,695
Rym: Yeah, I can you didn't.

159
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:21,760
Scott: you haven't done that at all yet.

160
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,396
Scott: Yeah, we don't even have any force choke able.

161
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:31,360
Rym: by first joke I mean the normal force power Because the normal force power makes you stand there like an idiot for enough time for me to walk over and kill you.

162
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:32,323
Scott: Yeah, it happens.

163
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:33,346
Scott: It's sort of like.

164
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:37,480
Scott: if you like River City Ransom and you like Star Wars you like this game also.

165
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:42,293
Rym: I'll admit that the cutscenes are actually really funny.

166
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,060
Scott: They are they're quite humorous.

167
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,404
Rym: There's this level of like.

168
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:49,979
Rym: they took every character in Star Wars, but they kind of caricatured them a little bit.

169
00:09:50,461 --> 00:10:00,711
Rym: so Leia's really kind of rabble rousing and bitchy and Luke is just a jerk and Obi-wan is totally incompetent in episode one.

170
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:07,143
Scott: We got to beat a few more levels to get the Han Solo I think one more level and we should have I gotta see me Greedo shoots first.

171
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:08,868
Scott: I'm waiting for the wiki action.

172
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,736
Rym: The game's just and I'm enjoyable.

173
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:13,321
Rym: Yeah, that's about the best I think.

174
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:21,355
Scott: the only other thing to say about the game is occasionally there are vehicle missions and The vehicle missions are actually the most fun because they sort of have you know, like.

175
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:32,599
Scott: well, some of them are terrible But like the pod race was actually a really fun kind of race I mean, it wasn't actually a race but it was like a fun sort of f-zero kind of experience and not bad.

176
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:38,440
Rym: Plus it's one of those games where much like River City Ransom if you're just killing time hanging out with some people.

177
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:44,560
Rym: You can pretty much play this game and engage in whatever social interaction you planned on without losing anything.

178
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:47,369
Scott: Yeah but overall though it is the game itself.

179
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:54,632
Scott: once you've seen all their all the funniness there is to see is Pretty much a mindless waste of time a la World of Warcraft.

180
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:58,245
Scott: So there's only limited amounts You're gonna get out of this game.

181
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:03,064
Scott: You know what I would if it was if it wasn't let me say this it Star Wars.

182
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:07,058
Scott: the fact that it is Star Wars and the fact that it is Lego is all the game has.

183
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,344
Scott: if the game was Not Star Wars.

184
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:09,189
Scott: It would be not worth it.

185
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,220
Rym: And if it wasn't Lego, right?

186
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,535
Scott: But I think Lego is.

187
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:18,000
Scott: you know They're coming out with like Lego Batman and Lego Indiana Jones and I assume those will be similar in a way.

188
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:22,320
Scott: But I think I'm just gonna opt to watch the cutscenes from them online rather than playing buying them.

189
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:26,173
Rym: I think I would almost put this at least for us in a category of games.

190
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:28,179
Rym: I would call coffee table games.

191
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:36,268
Rym: It's the kind of game if you got a bunch of friends over you pop it in until you play it and everyone else Kind of talks and kind of watches.

192
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:36,870
Scott: Yep.

193
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:39,200
Scott: It's not a game you play for serious now.

194
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:47,391
Scott: I mean it has a multiplayer mode, but I mean if I pick r2d2 and Rym picks the Emperor I really can't win even though I should be able to.

195
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:48,716
Scott: but this you can't.

196
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:49,820
Scott: r2d2 can't do anything.

197
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,256
Rym: It doesn't help that there's really only one attack.

198
00:11:53,718 --> 00:12:01,140
Scott: Yeah Lightsaber there's lightsaber and blaster and if you one guy has lightsaber and one guy has blaster guess who wins?

199
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:02,994
Rym: Not blaster.

200
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:03,699
Scott: You sure?

201
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:07,429
Scott: Let's try even if it's Boba Fett.

202
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,154
Rym: Boba Fett's got nothing.

203
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:10,779
Scott: I never bet the fat man.

204
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:15,472
Rym: Remember Boba Fett was never in straight-up single combat just with a Jedi.

205
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:18,180
Rym: He always ran away or something or he fell into the Sarla.

206
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:20,777
Rym: Well, yeah Don't bring that up.

207
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:22,246
Rym: I've missed that.

208
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,230
Scott: I hope they unlock that.

209
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,516
Scott: I hope I can unlock the Sarla.

210
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:26,784
Rym: Yeah What as a character?

211
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:29,753
Rym: Yes, B bites and a bites.

212
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:32,240
Scott: Well B opens up the hole and a close the hole.

213
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:33,711
Rym: Why would you ever close the hole?

214
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:34,336
Rym: just keep it open?

215
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:36,447
Scott: Well, no, okay Someone's trying to fly out with their jetpacks.

216
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:39,319
Scott: Ah, cuz you know his backpack has jets, right?

217
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:42,128
Scott: All right for my news.

218
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:44,016
Scott: I'm gonna talk about this new channel.

219
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:44,860
Scott: I'm in the Wii.

220
00:12:45,362 --> 00:12:47,352
Scott: It's called the check me out channel.

221
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:48,899
Rym: It's the best game on the Wii right now?

222
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,745
Rym: I don't know about that.

223
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:53,232
Rym: Well because I haven't played Mario Galaxy Lee yet.

224
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:56,200
Scott: Oh Guitar Hero 3 made me something.

225
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,488
Scott: Ah, even though Guitar Hero 3 is problematic.

226
00:12:58,508 --> 00:13:01,660
Rym: Guitar Hero 3 has already lost a lot of its pizzazz for me.

227
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:02,973
Rym: No, I think I kinda want to play.

228
00:13:02,993 --> 00:13:11,103
Rym: It's still fun But the novelty is gone and now my choice is either put effort into becoming very good at it or never play it again except in social situations.

229
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,834
Scott: So you're shit talking because you did say you were going to become very good at it.

230
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:15,140
Rym: I'm already pretty good.

231
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:17,498
Scott: Yeah, I can play it hard now, which is something.

232
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:19,324
Scott: anyway Check me out.

233
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:19,746
Scott: channel.

234
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,555
Scott: This is a channel that is sort of like.

235
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:25,369
Scott: I Feel almost as if why is this a separate channel?

236
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:28,660
Scott: The things that this channel does should be part of the regular me channel.

237
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,969
Rym: You know why it's a separate channel?

238
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,640
Rym: Because they brought it out later.

239
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,649
Rym: Yeah, it was probably easier to do that than it was to integrate it.

240
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:45,300
Scott: Basically what this does is it lets it basically does things the me channel should have done in the past and way it works is Sometimes they have a contest like the current contest is Mario lost his hat?

241
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:46,627
Scott: So you make a me.

242
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:48,780
Scott: that I guess is it of the theme.

243
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:55,435
Scott: Mario lost his hat and you submit it to the contest and then I guess in a few days after submissions close We'll vote on.

244
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:57,951
Scott: you know Everyone will get to vote on which ones they think are the best.

245
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:04,480
Scott: and then I guess whichever one wins Wins and you get points I guess for winning or something and then they're gonna have more contests.

246
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:12,340
Scott: The other part of the channel is just sort of like a top me's thing where you make me's and you sort of submit them And you give them initials, right?

247
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:22,379
Scott: So like we submitted our Teddy Roosevelt and we said TR you and you know If you I'd said what you go to you say What is he good at and we say he's a male and he's good at speeches, you know.

248
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:37,880
Scott: So now people go through when they look at me's and if they see our Teddy Roosevelt me and they think it's cool They say yes That is a cool me and you can go through and you can see like the top 50 me's around the world You can see random me's you can just any me that anyone submitted to the check me out channels.

249
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:44,532
Scott: You know, it's sort of like a me fashion show in a way of everybody not Pete not just people who are in your friends Whatever now one.

250
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:48,396
Rym: I'm Generally, very impressed with the quality of some of these me's.

251
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:52,232
Scott: a lot of them Just people followed instructions on the internet on how to make certain me's.

252
00:14:52,332 --> 00:14:56,511
Rym: but so those are obvious because you see ten of the same Thing yeah, but some of them are pretty good like that.

253
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:57,556
Scott: I'm on very good.

254
00:14:57,576 --> 00:15:07,048
Rym: I don't know I liked the Robo cop not so much because he looks like Robo cop which he did but because the initials were RC Robo cop.

255
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:08,894
Scott: Yeah, those should not I gave.

256
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:10,619
Scott: I give people special points.

257
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:18,500
Scott: actually I will vote for things specifically because of people choosing the correct initials or at least clever ones.

258
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:22,500
Scott: Yes, for example, someone made Cyclops from the x-men and it was okay.

259
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:29,686
Scott: But they gave him the initials SS which means they knew that it was Scott Summers Which means they get my vote.

260
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:32,580
Rym: the one thing I can say I saw a lot of complaints on the internet.

261
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,489
Scott: Robocop's name is Alex J. Murphy.

262
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,260
Rym: So if see my new Murphy, I didn't know his first name.

263
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,605
Scott: Yeah, if they would have put a.m.

264
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:41,190
Scott: I would have voted for that.

265
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,297
Rym: So would have Dave Riley probably.

266
00:15:43,698 --> 00:15:54,233
Rym: but uh I think my favorite thing about this is that I you know you go to the popular ones you look through the ones that people have voted up and People on the internet were complaining that it's just a bunch of random me's.

267
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:56,560
Rym: it's like a random me generator and it's stupid.

268
00:15:57,202 --> 00:16:06,119
Rym: But I realized because I looked at it and it was all for the most part famous people And I think a lot of kids don't know who these people are.

269
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,720
Scott: It's possible.

270
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,858
Scott: But then how did they get voted so highly if because there's also people like us?

271
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,865
Rym: Yeah Still Jack Black.

272
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:19,800
Scott: Yeah, all the top means are you know famous people or famous characters?

273
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:28,020
Scott: Like there's a Naruto in there the Star Wars guys are in there, you know All that sort of stuff and I think the reason they only let you put initials is to avoid getting sued.

274
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:37,255
Scott: Yeah, like if you wrote say, you know, Jack Black that'd be like hey or whatever, but if you just put JB Yeah, it's just a me with the initials JB.

275
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:38,000
Scott: We're in Nintendo.

276
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:38,903
Scott: What can we do about?

277
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:39,244
Scott: plus?

278
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:44,663
Rym: it makes it a lot because I don't think I can express to you how many Hitler's there are In there already.

279
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:45,848
Rym: There's a lot of ass.

280
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,940
Scott: I'm our most popular me that we have submitted is our Mohammed.

281
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,773
Scott: I'm disappointed though because I like the Teddy Roosevelt more.

282
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:54,060
Rym: I like our Tessie Rose.

283
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,708
Scott: Clean our bill clean, you know get no play.

284
00:16:57,748 --> 00:16:59,653
Rym: We didn't actually make our Teddy Roosevelt.

285
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:00,616
Scott: That's fine.

286
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,060
Scott: Someone else did that's fine.

287
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,044
Scott: Yes, what do I care?

288
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:04,128
Scott: It's on my me.

289
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:07,704
Rym: I'm I we it's yeah, and our Bill Clinton is perfect But I my.

290
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:10,720
Rym: our Mohammed is my favorite one and I hope a lot of people see it.

291
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,025
Rym: I wanted to get voted up because I think it looks pretty close Close to someone.

292
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:17,411
Scott: no one knows what they look like.

293
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:18,454
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

294
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:21,087
Rym: when you see it, you know What you're gonna think you're gonna think wow.

295
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:22,855
Rym: Yeah, they got him.

296
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:23,396
Rym: Yep.

297
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:25,204
Rym: That's him All right.

298
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:30,732
Scott: So yeah, if you have a we and you like the means at all You should probably check out the check me out channel.

299
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:39,763
Rym: Otherwise, yeah Things of the day.

300
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:42,932
Rym: so Scott team fortress - it came out, right?

301
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,820
Scott: Yep, and it was kinda cartoony, right?

302
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,244
Scott: You can forever is still not out.

303
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:50,274
Rym: I don't know that's gonna come out someday.

304
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:50,755
Scott: Yeah.

305
00:17:51,177 --> 00:17:56,980
Rym: Anyway, I mean at this point The fact that it hasn't come out in so long is probably the best marketing they could have ever got.

306
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,729
Scott: I saw a rumor that went farther than any other rumor.

307
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:03,020
Scott: I've seen before that was like pre-orders soon question mark.

308
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:06,709
Rym: I saw that in something that I realized was a spam.

309
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:07,170
Scott: Yeah.

310
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:15,400
Rym: Anyway, anyway, a Lot of you were probably aware that Team Fortress 2 took a long time to come out and there's a lot of reason for that.

311
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,720
Rym: I think we talked about it a little bit when we did a show on the history of Team Fortress.

312
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:38,152
Rym: But suffice to say Team Fortress 2 is really the sequel to Team Fortress classic Which is really the sequel to Team Fortress aka mega Team Fortress, even though that was actually a model, but I digress Team Fortress 2 as it was originally conceived was Nothing like the Team Fortress 2 that you got recently.

313
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:39,918
Scott: Well, it was conceived in the late 90s.

314
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:47,991
Scott: They couldn't even think the kind of thing that Team Fortress 2 is now is something that no one could even Conceive in their mind in that year.

315
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:49,960
Rym: neither was the original idea.

316
00:18:50,161 --> 00:19:03,204
Scott: It would be as hard to conceive of the of the TF2 that we have now in 1999 or 2000 as it would be to conceive of computers in the year 1800.

317
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:25,852
Rym: See the thing is Team Fortress 2. the people making it Realized that Team Fortress and all of its brethren were pretty much Some of the best games ever and they got a lot of smart people together and said we are going to make Team Fortress 2. it is going to be the end-all the be-all the perfect team first-person shooter It is going to have everything is going to be the highest technology.

318
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:31,674
Rym: Most realistic best game ever Mm-hmm, and I've got here a video.

319
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:32,960
Rym: It looks like it's in German.

320
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,559
Rym: I think it looks like it's some sort of press conference at a con and obviously it's just a cam.

321
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:52,540
Rym: but This is a bunch of footage of the original Team Fortress 2 as it was slated to eventually come out in the year maybe 2000. yeah now you might think wait a minute.

322
00:19:52,842 --> 00:20:00,158
Rym: This looks a lot like all those World War 2. whatever games people play today I point out that none of those games existed when they were making this.

323
00:20:00,902 --> 00:20:05,360
Rym: This I mean the scene where it shows the guy fighting the tank and then they throw the grenade in the tank.

324
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:08,100
Rym: That was a wet dream for us back.

325
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:15,660
Rym: Then the idea of having a game and FPS that complex and that awesome Was too much to bear and that's why the game didn't get finished back.

326
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:17,605
Rym: Yeah because it was pretty much impossible.

327
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,889
Scott: it was ahead of its time.

328
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:23,868
Scott: too far so far ahead of its time that they needed more time to Get to get to get it and

329
00:20:23,908 --> 00:20:30,759
Rym: by the time the technology got to the point where they could do that That was no longer what they wanted to do because that was what everyone else was doing.

330
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:33,143
Scott: Yep.

331
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:33,324
Scott: Yep.

332
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:33,484
Scott: Yep.

333
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:40,405
Rym: And as a result, we got the great game we have today, even though I'm already sick of it Me too So much for that.

334
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,071
Rym: I waited ten years.

335
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:43,275
Rym: it comes out I play it a week.

336
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:49,673
Rym: Hey, yeah, okay You know Kid Icarus, right one of the best games ever and by best.

337
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:55,470
Scott: I qualify that by also saying hardest Yeah, well, it's sort of an infamous game.

338
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,516
Scott: I've never legitimately beaten it.

339
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,396
Scott: It's yeah, it's one of those I've barely beaten.

340
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:12,360
Scott: level two It's one of those few like infamous Nintendo games where you know Nintendo made it was a game way back in the day that was crazy popular But there was never a sequel and they never went anywhere with it and everyone's like, oh man, bring it back like earth pound.

341
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,271
Scott: They're like bring it back.

342
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:13,940
Scott: Bring it back.

343
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,420
Scott: You know Kid Icarus is the one that needs bringing back more than any other and Nintendo recognizes.

344
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,760
Scott: I think pit is gonna be is definitely gonna be in the next Smash Brothers brawl, whatever.

345
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:26,000
Scott: So they know the Kid Icarus is beloved and missed.

346
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:28,208
Scott: But here is something interesting.

347
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:33,549
Scott: I found this is the original Japanese television commercial for Kid Icarus.

348
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:35,856
Scott: now, there's two things important to notice about this.

349
00:21:36,017 --> 00:21:36,960
Scott: one is a fucked-up commercial.

350
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:43,612
Scott: Maybe the guy turns ha Japanese commercial weird a. yeah I mean the guy turns to stone which is because of Medusa.

351
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:47,580
Scott: but like this kid runs by at the end Randomly and like I wish I knew what they were saying.

352
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,380
Scott: Maybe we should ask Emily to translate it, but it's a fucked-up commercial and it's pretty interesting.

353
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,153
Scott: But - at the end they're like all disk system because the you should go.

354
00:21:56,334 --> 00:22:08,591
Scott: I'm not gonna explain what it was and everything about But in Japan they had the Famicom disk system and there were games for it on disks that you could get and it was nothing like anything we ever got.

355
00:22:08,752 --> 00:22:09,817
Scott: and it was pretty awesome.

356
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,770
Scott: and You should learn about that because it's important Nintendo history.

357
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,775
Scott: That is not very well known in the US.

358
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:22,235
Rym: now regarding Kid Icarus I I'm curious how many of you out there actually really played that game.

359
00:22:22,255 --> 00:22:23,760
Scott: So is it on the virtual console yet?

360
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:25,746
Rym: Yeah, it is but the is it?

361
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:27,874
Rym: the codes don't work really?

362
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:41,960
Rym: the old codes the broken codes Uh-huh, Kid Icarus was famous for having weird codes that gave you a lot of stuff And the reason for that was that there was basically not much check summing or check digits or anything in the password.

363
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:45,019
Rym: So it was very easy to make a legitimate password.

364
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:58,639
Rym: Hence Icarus fights Medusa Angel or packing packing packing packing or my favorite it ain't followed by an infinite stream of lowercase use Uh-huh, and none of those work in the virtual console version, apparently, uh-huh.

365
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,792
Scott: Well do any passwords work in the normal real passwords?

366
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:02,495
Rym: do I assume?

367
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:03,780
Scott: I don't know.

368
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,565
Scott: I gotta go look this up cuz.

369
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:07,891
Scott: uh, yeah, but anyway, it's.

370
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,120
Scott: it's a hard game has awesome music it you should probably play it.

371
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,421
Scott: Well,

372
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:29,073
Rym: I wonder one how many of you realize that not only is it a top scroller, but there's also a bunch of you know maze two-dimensional, you know up down left and right levels and There's some side scroll in Mario one kind of action in that game and at the end of the game It's a side scrolling shmup.

373
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:39,719
Rym: Yep Also, I really want to ask have any of you ever legitimately and by legitimately I mean without cheating or using someone else's code beaten that game?

374
00:23:40,784 --> 00:23:42,051
Scott: Not many people have done that.

375
00:23:42,936 --> 00:23:47,050
Rym: it's also His name's pit not Icarus.

376
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,856
Scott: I know I know his name is pit.

377
00:23:48,936 --> 00:23:49,940
Scott: Did I say no you didn't.

378
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,430
Rym: I'm just saying that to all of you out there.

379
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:51,893
Scott: Okay.

380
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:52,799
Scott: Yeah, okay.

381
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,145
Scott: So today we're gonna.

382
00:23:55,205 --> 00:24:02,686
Scott: we've been talking recently about a certain topic in gaming and me and Rym have differing opinions though I think a lot with us lately.

383
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:05,719
Rym: every time we introduce anything we start real generic like.

384
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:07,646
Scott: So I think I like.

385
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:09,833
Scott: I like doing it that way something so you don't get.

386
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:17,074
Scott: instead of getting to the point you sort of You know beat around the bush a little bit to drag people in so they wonder what you're talking about And then you hit him with it.

387
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,192
Rym: See it's a lot like how I was taught to write essays in middle school.

388
00:24:20,453 --> 00:24:24,210
Rym: you start with a global statement And then you narrow it down to a thesis.

389
00:24:24,492 --> 00:24:26,320
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like scorpion.

390
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,300
Scott: He's like he throws a little rope and he says get over here and then he says yeah Uppercut and the uppercut was really wall he wanted to do.

391
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,397
Scott: I mean if you were already next to me just uppercut you but now we got to do the get over here first.

392
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,289
Rym: see but At the same time when I got to 10th grade, mr.

393
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:45,199
Rym: Koval my but the best literature teacher I ever had And he taught me more grammar than anyone else in my life.

394
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:50,715
Rym: He taught us that and had us write a paper and then he failed all of us.

395
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:54,932
Rym: and then he taught us again how stupid it is to start with a global statement like that.

396
00:24:55,474 --> 00:25:01,726
Rym: if you're saying something that's so Incontroversial and so nothing why even say it?

397
00:25:01,786 --> 00:25:04,509
Rym: Why not just start with something important or something interesting?

398
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:12,100
Scott: Uh-huh Anyway, he knew about English but not about in literature, but not about radio, which is not literature.

399
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:20,259
Rym: See the thing is we're not radio in the some guys gonna flip past GeekNights in the middle And we got to try to get him to not flip to another thing.

400
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:38,066
Scott: No But we are radio in the sense that people listening to this are probably staring at their computers at work Not really paying full attention and by saying certain things I can get their attention like hey you hey, yeah you sitting there Yeah, right there looking at your computer screen not actually listening to the words of the podcast Just using it as background noise.

401
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:39,975
Scott: pay attention to what I'm about to say.

402
00:25:39,995 --> 00:25:41,099
Scott: you suck.

403
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:48,397
Rym: Scott seems to have a bug up his butt about achievements and I am for the record.

404
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:55,060
Rym: I have Absolutely, nothing against achievements at all, and I don't know why he hates them so much.

405
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,653
Scott: Well, I think the thing is and you I guess are include is that I am.

406
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:00,460
Scott: I am definitely not pro achievement.

407
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:09,980
Scott: however, I think people are Misinterpreting and exaggerating and and misunderstanding my exact very specific position and opinion on achievements.

408
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:12,024
Rym: Do I could?

409
00:26:12,065 --> 00:26:15,459
Rym: I could go to the forum and quote some things you've posted there about?

410
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,122
Scott: yeah But I never.

411
00:26:16,223 --> 00:26:19,680
Scott: I was too lazy to actually post my entire full opinion in great detail.

412
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:26,187
Rym: Oh, so instead all those insults and all that that's a stupid idea and you're a stupid person That was those are true too.

413
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:28,620
Scott: But you know, they I didn't sum up the whole thing together.

414
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,756
Scott: I sort of doled it out in little bits never doling out the whole what we're talking about.

415
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:36,651
Rym: All right an Xbox I'm sure you all know but I know there's people who don't have Xboxes.

416
00:26:37,153 --> 00:26:41,350
Rym: and now because this isn't a lot of steam games now Well, then it's in the orange box specifically.

417
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:43,077
Scott: Yeah, not any other steam games.

418
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,440
Rym: I Foresee a future where there is more of that.

419
00:26:46,661 --> 00:26:50,256
Scott: Well as people, you know make more games that are for the 360 and the PC.

420
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:54,600
Scott: I've you know, they're doing achievements in one you leave them in the other.

421
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,839
Rym: It's not like, you know, especially since by and large people the world over love them.

422
00:26:59,502 --> 00:27:01,250
Scott: Yeah, people seem to really like these things

423
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:21,137
Rym: and all they are is you can set When you make a game whatever kinds of carrot danglies you want Whatever kind of conditions of getting achievements and then whenever you meet those conditions in the game You get a little badge kind of like how in tie fighter if you get enough Secondary missions you get the extra little pin on the on the metal at the end of the mission.

424
00:27:21,358 --> 00:27:21,498
Rym: Mm-hmm.

425
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,648
Scott: So for example that you'll be playing I don't know Some zombie shooting game and there'll be.

426
00:27:28,788 --> 00:27:31,960
Scott: there'll be an achievement for killing a thousand zombies.

427
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,360
Scott: So you're playing the game normally and suddenly you kill your thousands zombie.

428
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,721
Scott: You didn't even realize you killed your thousands zombie but you did.

429
00:27:38,142 --> 00:28:00,260
Scott: and a thing pops up and says you killed a thousand zombie and it'll say thousand killer or something and it'll add to Your Xbox live gamers score will go up by a certain number of points and you'll get this little flag that says, you know You got X number out of X available possible achievements And if people look they'll see that you got the zombie killer achievement that you killed a thousand zombies in whatever game.

430
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:01,707
Scott: And that's what it is.

431
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:15,552
Scott: and my specific thing with this is that You know, there's nothing wrong with in it within a video game of setting goals, you know for people to achieve, you know For example, you know Metroid right?

432
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:20,471
Scott: It's like hey beat the game faster And you you you know, you'll see a different ending, you know that.

433
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:22,580
Scott: or hey, this is Tetris.

434
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,907
Scott: We're gonna give you a bonus level.

435
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:34,046
Scott: if you can beat this bonus level you get you know Stuff or like in portal there's like the challenge levels where the turrets are in cages and it's harder and it's like, you know Okay, that's cool.

436
00:28:34,689 --> 00:28:41,740
Scott: But this stuff right these achievements They're not actually making like bonus rounds that are that are extra stuff.

437
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,900
Scott: They're just within the normal game like putting these things around that just pop up.

438
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:54,240
Rym: Well one I think one purpose that achievements can do which is it depends on the kind of game They'll use your thousand killer zombie example.

439
00:28:54,441 --> 00:29:06,645
Rym: Yeah, let's say the first achievement of the game is you know killed a thousand zombie and it says thousand killer Wow, I got the thousand killer and then you find out that the next achievement is 25,000 killer.

440
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:11,479
Rym: suddenly you have this huge sense of scale that is just thrown in your face of.

441
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:18,260
Rym: It's kind of like a measure of how much of the game I've experienced or how much zombie killing I can expect from the rest.

442
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,159
Scott: That is true.

443
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:22,065
Scott: But that then my first.

444
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:25,935
Scott: that brings me to my first problem with achievements is that they are the meta.

445
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:29,059
Scott: now in some games Meta is not a problem.

446
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:32,834
Scott: but for example in my half-life 2 I had to turn those freakin achievements off.

447
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:48,220
Scott: cuz half-life 2 and you know It's sequels are all about a cinematic immersive experience and I'm playing it and then this thing pops up in the corner and it totally Throws me out of the game like, you know when you're watching a movie and you get thrown out of it and suddenly you're like Oh, I'm in a movie theater and you're totally not in it anymore.

448
00:29:48,763 --> 00:29:51,780
Scott: That was not good and it sort of dulled the experience for me.

449
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,388
Scott: so I had to turn those achievement thingies off.

450
00:29:53,428 --> 00:29:58,729
Rym: see at the same time when I was playing portal and I did the sad deed.

451
00:29:58,749 --> 00:30:05,030
Rym: I did the bad thing and then Suddenly I get the achievement fratricide.

452
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,636
Rym: I busted out laughing.

453
00:30:06,676 --> 00:30:07,619
Rym: That was the best thing ever.

454
00:30:08,282 --> 00:30:12,499
Rym: No having that achievement appear at that moment actually added to the game.

455
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:16,009
Scott: Yeah, I guess in a way you could use achievements for funniness.

456
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,155
Scott: that there that is not you know.

457
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:25,963
Rym: and also in half-life 2 I don't think I would be thrown off by an achievement so much as I am by the fact that I'm stuck in a room And someone's talking at me.

458
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:29,152
Rym: Meanwhile, I'm jumping up and down on him.

459
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,760
Scott: Hey, I'm in the game when I'm doing that stuff.

460
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,623
Scott: That's what it's all about.

461
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:37,119
Scott: Yes, that's like natural selection when the gorges are making a pile on top of the cheese.

462
00:30:37,982 --> 00:30:49,479
Scott: All right, my other problem with achievements is you know, this is not some rule of the universe here It's I guess you can't say it's the fault of the achievements even though I can make a case for it.

463
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:53,079
Scott: Is that whether you say you do it or not?

464
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:08,232
Scott: There are people and I've seen these people and these people say it outright They admit it is that there are people who are they're playing a video game, right and they are playing the video game More to get achievements when they would not have right.

465
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:15,096
Scott: so so here's the thing is someone is to play a video game Right, and now you're sitting there and they would if there was no achievement right?

466
00:31:15,136 --> 00:31:16,060
Scott: pretend there's no achievements.

467
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:19,110
Scott: This person has no desire to play this video game again, right?

468
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,093
Scott: None whatsoever.

469
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:22,180
Scott: They they would not have fun doing it.

470
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:28,345
Scott: But now someone puts this, you know meta carrot of these points there Which is just nothing.

471
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:39,374
Scott: and suddenly they want to do it and it's like alright If it wasn't fun if it wasn't fun for you to do it now It's suddenly fun for you to do it because you're getting a number.

472
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:40,097
Scott: see one.

473
00:31:41,322 --> 00:31:43,873
Rym: Why on earth does this bother you?

474
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:48,551
Scott: It doesn't bother me I don't you know, but it doesn't bother me really.

475
00:31:48,692 --> 00:31:52,591
Scott: the thing is is that it's Wow Look at these people.

476
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:56,211
Scott: people can do whatever they want Hey can but I lose respect for them.

477
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,477
Scott: and when I see that silly

478
00:31:57,517 --> 00:31:57,979
Rym: Scott now to

479
00:31:58,422 --> 00:32:03,405
Scott: Someone who's gonna do something that is not entertaining Uh, you know in it because

480
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:16,512
Rym: you seem to be forgetting that part of what achievements do especially the fun the weird ones like Beat this with only taking a hundred steps or beat this game Carrying this object the whole way through

481
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:17,095
Scott: right?

482
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:18,563
Rym: It's okay Is it?

483
00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:21,276
Rym: it's no different than a lot of like you to game.

484
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:21,518
Rym: facts.

485
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:26,500
Rym: for any game There's always like the challenges and someone's like hey, can you beat this game?

486
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:32,773
Rym: Without doing this or this or this or keep it this game with only one only one character.

487
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:39,060
Rym: and What the achievements do is instead of having to go to some stupid game fact and find some kid who said hey do this.

488
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:42,884
Rym: they give you a list of ideas like Check it out.

489
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:44,250
Rym: This is possible.

490
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:49,129
Rym: We are telling you right now out of the game We've already beaten it that this is possible.

491
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:51,596
Rym: if that means you can try to attempt it.

492
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,619
Rym: It'll give you the idea, huh?

493
00:32:53,343 --> 00:32:55,379
Rym: I wonder if I have the skill to pull that off.

494
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,264
Scott: Yeah, and you know what.

495
00:32:57,304 --> 00:33:02,260
Scott: back in the day without achievements people still did this all the time beating Zelda without the sword.

496
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:06,160
Rym: Not everyone a lot of people have never occurred to them and I think one thing the achievement.

497
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,705
Scott: They don't lose respect for those people.

498
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:08,147
Scott: They're dumb.

499
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:09,672
Scott: They're not paying attention to their games.

500
00:33:09,893 --> 00:33:10,535
Scott: That's silly.

501
00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:11,900
Scott: Not creative in their gameplay.

502
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,265
Rym: So even if you're creative What if you just don't think of one thing?

503
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:19,120
Rym: or even worse if you're the first one or there's nothing to tell you it's possible.

504
00:33:19,754 --> 00:33:23,775
Rym: All right you're gonna spend a lot of time possibly trying to do things that the game will not let you do.

505
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:24,739
Rym: this at least gives you the.

506
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:26,385
Rym: This is possible.

507
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:26,667
Rym: Now.

508
00:33:26,727 --> 00:33:27,390
Rym: It's a puzzle.

509
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,153
Rym: figure it out.

510
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:29,238
Scott: That's true.

511
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:32,969
Scott: However There are people out there who it.

512
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:36,800
Scott: let's say you had the same game, right and you put in a special mode.

513
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,473
Scott: For example, that was like the hundred step mode where once you took your hundred and first step It said game over on the screen and it put you back out.

514
00:33:43,493 --> 00:33:44,840
Scott: You know, I had the hundred step mode.

515
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:46,597
Scott: Yeah, right There's nothing wrong with that.

516
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:54,099
Scott: But there are people out there where if you had the game with a hundred step mode They would do the hundred step mode just become frustrated and wouldn't play it.

517
00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:02,611
Scott: But you put that achievement there and suddenly these people are playing it like crazy trying to win it and trying to get this thing Just to get this useless points thing.

518
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,057
Scott: Well, I mean anything one.

519
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:04,680
Rym: Why do you care?

520
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,682
Rym: Cuz you really really can't seem to let this go It's not?

521
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:14,670
Scott: you see you keep saying I care as you do is the fact that these people are doing something which otherwise Why do you care?

522
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:20,539
Scott: Because this people doing something since the same reason I care if I see people.

523
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:25,054
Scott: No, why do you get pissed off at people doing stupid things that don't affect you all the time?

524
00:34:25,074 --> 00:34:26,600
Rym: because it does affect me.

525
00:34:26,902 --> 00:34:32,980
Scott: No, there are plenty of things, you know You see like someone being fat even if they're totally not in your way and you're like, wow that person's hurting themselves.

526
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:34,940
Scott: Wow, that person's doing something is not fun for them.

527
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:41,420
Scott: Wow, that person's doing something is not good for them and you don't think For an achievement is hurting anybody.

528
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:48,380
Scott: It's something that others there are people who would are doing things which otherwise would not be fun for them.

529
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:55,784
Scott: But suddenly, you know because of this psychological trick Scott one of a of a immaterial one Where are you getting this information?

530
00:34:55,965 --> 00:34:58,353
Scott: Just go on the internet and look everyone.

531
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:01,767
Scott: people are saying all man's, you know Look at all my mad achievements.

532
00:35:01,928 --> 00:35:02,531
Scott: What's my game?

533
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:03,797
Scott: risk or so much higher than yours.

534
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:08,080
Scott: or yeah I'm getting this game on a 360 instead of the ps3 because it has achievements.

535
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:13,338
Rym: Well, that's a given because it's the same game with something extra if it costs something extra.

536
00:35:13,418 --> 00:35:14,000
Scott: It's nothing.

537
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:18,115
Scott: That's the thing is guys and it's a nut it's a carrot but this carrot is nothing.

538
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:22,757
Scott: but like you get there You do you run you get the carrot you eat it and it's it's nothing.

539
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:24,984
Scott: It's the hollow Picture of a carrot.

540
00:35:25,024 --> 00:35:26,308
Rym: It's the exact same game.

541
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:30,000
Rym: Plus if you want it, you've got the achievement system.

542
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:32,508
Rym: Why not buy the one with the achievement system?

543
00:35:32,528 --> 00:35:34,153
Scott: because the achievement system is nothing.

544
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:34,855
Scott: It's nothing.

545
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:36,460
Scott: It's just little things that pop up.

546
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,685
Scott: That's not anything Scott.

547
00:35:38,126 --> 00:35:39,351
Rym: Mario 3 is no different.

548
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:40,736
Rym: It's just little things that pop up.

549
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:41,840
Scott: what things that pop?

550
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,344
Rym: Goombas and stuff.

551
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:44,107
Rym: It's no different.

552
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:45,252
Scott: That's not pie.

553
00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:46,940
Scott: It's you know, that's not what I'm saying.

554
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:47,460
Rym: What are you saying?

555
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:57,212
Rym: All you're saying Scott is that you think that someone who is willing to pay the same amount and have an extra thing even though You don't care about that thing is somehow stupid because that extra thing is nothing.

556
00:35:57,352 --> 00:35:59,539
Rym: It's like if you're not it's nothing to you.

557
00:35:59,861 --> 00:36:01,649
Scott: It's that is if it's something to you.

558
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:03,557
Scott: I did I don't I lose respect for you.

559
00:36:03,618 --> 00:36:04,080
Scott: It's nothing.

560
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,067
Scott: That's just the same as World of Warcraft.

561
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:08,015
Scott: gold and World of Warcraft is nothing.

562
00:36:08,055 --> 00:36:09,480
Scott: levels in World of Warcraft are nothing.

563
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:13,300
Scott: That's not an actual, you know, it's not an actual reward.

564
00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:14,544
Scott: It's not so.

565
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:19,683
Rym: if you beat a game in a really hard way like say you beat Zelda without a sword Would you ever tell anyone?

566
00:36:19,703 --> 00:36:22,311
Scott: I might but it.

567
00:36:22,392 --> 00:36:24,920
Rym: you're saying if you beat Zelda 1, but I just saw it.

568
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,131
Scott: Anyone should be able to do that.

569
00:36:26,212 --> 00:36:28,002
Scott: It's easy Sky.

570
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:28,786
Rym: you're missing the point.

571
00:36:29,008 --> 00:36:29,792
Rym: Let's say you're a kid.

572
00:36:29,832 --> 00:36:31,300
Rym: you beat Zelda 1 without the sword.

573
00:36:31,601 --> 00:36:32,223
Rym: Are you just gonna go?

574
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:34,751
Rym: Wow, I did it and then just never say anything again.

575
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:35,694
Rym: Are you gonna tell someone?

576
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:37,400
Scott: I'm I have someone asked.

577
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:41,460
Rym: Aha you're just gonna never tell anyone unless they ask you by chance.

578
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:44,334
Rym: Hey Scott, have you ever beaten Zelda 1 without the sword?

579
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:45,359
Scott: Yeah, it's easy.

580
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:47,246
Rym: You're missing the point.

581
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:49,979
Scott: Do you see me bragging about my video game skills a lot?

582
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:57,715
Rym: Oh when we were doing the FPS shows when we were talking about Team Fortress 2 I think you are much more the braggart of your skills than I am.

583
00:36:57,776 --> 00:36:59,945
Rym: Well, I'm a lot better than you So I think that's justified.

584
00:37:00,105 --> 00:37:02,877
Scott: Yeah, I see you proved my point exactly.

585
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:06,840
Scott: and second of all I'm pretty much I am very honest with my statement of my skills.

586
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,520
Scott: I don't claim to be any sort of God in any way.

587
00:37:09,581 --> 00:37:11,700
Scott: I'm just you know, and in fact a lot of games I suck.

588
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,025
Scott: I know a lot of our like wait three.

589
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:15,475
Scott: a lot of our listeners like it's our hero gods.

590
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:18,387
Scott: and I'm just like still you Know not passing every song on hard.

591
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,380
Rym: I was just saying Justin at the FPS world particularly the twitch FPS.

592
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,507
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, the point is.

593
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:30,172
Rym: the point is someone else wants achievements or they like achievements Then obviously they should buy the one that has the achievements in it.

594
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:30,835
Rym: What do you care?

595
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:31,980
Scott: Here's the thing.

596
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,520
Scott: All right, I get when I play a game the reason that's you yeah who cares about you?

597
00:37:36,842 --> 00:37:38,540
Scott: I'm not saying anyone has to care about me.

598
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:44,796
Scott: I'm saying is that I get my enjoyment from games because I actually feel like I achieve something real.

599
00:37:44,877 --> 00:37:50,240
Scott: or I do achieve something real Or I decrease my skill or I get a real reward of some kind.

600
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:56,779
Scott: And when I see people getting enjoyment from nothings, then I don't respect that.

601
00:37:56,879 --> 00:38:00,291
Rym: but Getting what reward you get from beating mario 3?

602
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:03,080
Rym: that's any different from getting level 70 in World of Warcraft?

603
00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:03,860
Rym: There's no difference.

604
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,883
Scott: There is a difference in my.

605
00:38:04,923 --> 00:38:07,351
Scott: to beat mario 3 actually requires skill.

606
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:09,497
Scott: you actually build up a skill over time.

607
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:12,508
Scott: to beat to get Level 70 of World of Warcraft only takes time.

608
00:38:12,649 --> 00:38:13,131
Scott: It's not so.

609
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:15,861
Scott: unless you risk you're respecting somebody's Ability.

610
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:21,939
Rym: you got to have precision timing and button presses or skill at mario 3 is just as laughably useless.

611
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:27,040
Scott: See but there's actually a skill there and there's actually a feeling of accomplishment.

612
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:29,766
Rym: It's not a real accomplishment.

613
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:30,650
Scott: It is a real account.

614
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,220
Rym: Oh, it's a feeling of accomplishment is no different than an achievement.

615
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:34,775
Scott: No, there is a real accomplishment.

616
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:42,763
Scott: at the beginning You are not Physically able to do it and then over time you built up your ability to do it and some people are unable to write Ability to do it.

617
00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:45,594
Scott: So World of Warcraft requires no increase of ability.

618
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:47,060
Scott: It requires only an increase.

619
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:55,899
Rym: Yeah, fine, so all right, what's the difference between beating mario 3 or beating the whatever video game in a hundred steps?

620
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:57,802
Scott: It's not.

621
00:38:57,863 --> 00:39:00,513
Scott: there's nothing wrong with beating the video game in a hundred steps.

622
00:39:00,573 --> 00:39:00,994
Scott: the thing that.

623
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:01,697
Scott: so why not?

624
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:06,391
Scott: the thing that's wrong Is that if you're doing it because you get this little flag to light up?

625
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:09,019
Scott: It's like basically imagine you're playing mario 3, right?

626
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,289
Scott: Okay, you play mario 3 you beat it.

627
00:39:11,409 --> 00:39:11,872
Scott: It's fun.

628
00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:12,455
Scott: Now.

629
00:39:12,536 --> 00:39:13,280
Scott: What if I told you?

630
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,065
Scott: Hey, if you can beat mario 3 in an hour I'll turn this light on.

631
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,380
Scott: now suddenly you decide you want to do it really bad.

632
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,155
Scott: You want that light to turn on so bad so that someone's caring about a light turning on.

633
00:39:25,456 --> 00:39:26,680
Scott: that is what I disrespect.

634
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:28,307
Rym: Why why do you care?

635
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,652
Scott: It's not because that's innate.

636
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:31,660
Scott: Do you care if some frickin light turns on?

637
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,540
Scott: No, you get the enjoyment from the game itself.

638
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:39,899
Scott: If you're getting the enjoyment from a light turning on what kind of person are you you enjoy something so meaningless?

639
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:43,797
Rym: Wow Scott way to take a little video game thing and try to get all self-righteous about it.

640
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:45,827
Scott: That's what I am Self-righteous about it.

641
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:46,691
Rym: I think you're right.

642
00:39:46,771 --> 00:39:47,515
Scott: I can't get in.

643
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:49,603
Rym: at best perhaps I can't get.

644
00:39:49,743 --> 00:39:51,327
Scott: I get a point of a game.

645
00:39:51,648 --> 00:40:01,806
Scott: the point of games in general all games is to have some sort of Challenge without the risk and to build your skills, you know Challenge everything Scott.

646
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:04,034
Rym: there are games that involve no skill.

647
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:05,559
Rym: there again, and there's still a game.

648
00:40:06,043 --> 00:40:07,660
Rym: There are games that are pure enjoyment.

649
00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:11,420
Rym: There are games that don't build anything except enjoyment and relaxation.

650
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:18,360
Scott: But those games have some redeemable aspects like what actual reward like what well like apples to apples has a reward of humor?

651
00:40:18,924 --> 00:40:19,468
Scott: Yeah, you get it.

652
00:40:19,488 --> 00:40:21,020
Scott: You get a humorous social situation.

653
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,985
Rym: You know what's an effect.

654
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:25,200
Scott: you increase your social skills and you got on with other people.

655
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:26,664
Scott: There's an actual reward.

656
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:29,413
Rym: achievement gives you proof that you did something very.

657
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:30,255
Rym: that's not an actual.

658
00:40:30,356 --> 00:40:31,539
Scott: or there's a light bulb turning on.

659
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:33,060
Scott: a light Bulb turning on is not a reward.

660
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,851
Rym: So basically what you're saying is anything you say is a reward.

661
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:40,146
Rym: anything you say isn't a reward isn't a reward and therefore I'm saying yes, you are.

662
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:43,880
Scott: No, I'm saying no, you're saying different things are rewarding to different people.

663
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:53,900
Rym: However, if you think a light bulb turning on is rewarding if that's rewarding for you I disrespect you and I just find that stance utterly silly and I think you take these at this achievement thing way too.

664
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,629
Scott: Seriously, I'm not taking it way too.

665
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,480
Rym: Seriously you freak out about it every time.

666
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,946
Scott: We I'm just saying what it is.

667
00:40:59,027 --> 00:41:04,380
Scott: and the thing is people give us a huge backlash and I'm like, dude You're the one who cares about a light bulb turning on.

668
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,220
Rym: I think the backlash is because you're kind of a jerk about it all the time.

669
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,186
Scott: Yeah, I am a jerk about it.

670
00:41:08,206 --> 00:41:10,660
Scott: cuz I if I disrespect someone now, I gotta be a jerk to them.

671
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:11,358
Scott: That's how it goes.

672
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:19,432
Rym: If you disrespect someone because they like one part of a kind of video game Then you don't happen to like that exact same part of a kind of video game.

673
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:21,600
Rym: That's really silly.

674
00:41:21,841 --> 00:41:22,965
Scott: I disrespect anyone.

675
00:41:23,005 --> 00:41:28,205
Scott: people who get enjoy like if people, you know get enjoyment from shallow things I disrespect.

676
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:33,060
Rym: you just said you get enjoyment from Lego Star Wars, which is a stupid shallow bullshit game.

677
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:37,400
Scott: I get enjoyment from the humor aspect and when that humor aspect runs out, I probably won't play it anymore.

678
00:41:37,601 --> 00:41:43,120
Rym: But yet you walked around for 15 minutes destroying things in a Lego City and it wasn't entertaining.

679
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:44,252
Rym: It was almost it wasn't.

680
00:41:44,272 --> 00:41:45,060
Scott: it was painful.

681
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:46,164
Rym: Then why did you do it?

682
00:41:46,384 --> 00:41:49,214
Scott: because the psychology of it was too demanding and I couldn't.

683
00:41:49,314 --> 00:41:51,160
Scott: I know you're saying time to overcome that.

684
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:58,552
Rym: Wait, so you're saying that you had no conscious control over the fact that you ran around as Darth Maul Destroying a tiny Lego City for 15 minutes.

685
00:41:58,592 --> 00:41:59,657
Scott: I had control over it.

686
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,916
Scott: The problem was is I realized what was going on and I couldn't help it for a bit and I realized that's what happening to people thing is.

687
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:09,849
Rym: Came it and said you couldn't help it.

688
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:12,479
Rym: That means you didn't have control until you did overcome it.

689
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,979
Scott: I knew what was going on.

690
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:24,128
Rym: You're saying that Lego Star Wars was able to control your body for a small amount of time and you were unable Without effort to overcome that mentally.

691
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:27,440
Rym: and yet you're trying to disrespect someone who likes a light bulb.

692
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,804
Scott: Yes, because the difference is is that I knew what was going on and I stopped it in about a minute Whereas I see other people.

693
00:42:33,105 --> 00:42:40,773
Scott: they're doing it for years and years and years and years on end without stopping or realizing or admitting It Scott that the psychology of the video games is controlling them.

694
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,560
Rym: Scott achievements haven't been around that long.

695
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:44,368
Scott: I'm not talking about achievements.

696
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,394
Scott: and look at World of Warcraft.

697
00:42:45,414 --> 00:42:46,380
Scott: people are playing this thing.

698
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,185
Scott: It's the same shit.

699
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:48,996
Scott: Look at look at muds back in the day.

700
00:42:49,016 --> 00:42:49,680
Scott: It was the same shit.

701
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,030
Scott: I eventually realized it and stopped doing it yet.

702
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:57,620
Scott: There are people defending this sort of, you know Invisible non, you know real carrot stuff.

703
00:42:57,821 --> 00:43:00,777
Scott: There's nothing wrong with carrot and stick as long as it's a real stick and a real.

704
00:43:00,818 --> 00:43:03,107
Rym: but Scott It's not a real carrot beating.

705
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:05,817
Rym: Mario 3 is a virtual carrot and so is beating.

706
00:43:05,857 --> 00:43:06,780
Rym: so it's not beating.

707
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,747
Scott: Mario 3 is an actual carrot.

708
00:43:09,028 --> 00:43:10,252
Rym: You don't get anything physical.

709
00:43:10,292 --> 00:43:15,160
Scott: Yes, you do you ink you get the Satisfaction that your ability has increased.

710
00:43:15,842 --> 00:43:22,080
Scott: Okay in yourself that you have bettered yourself in some even though it's a meaningless way you have bettered yourself.

711
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:26,900
Scott: It's the same feeling is if you just run and jump over, you know, you're doing the high jump.

712
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,700
Scott: You know you jump and you can jump higher and then you make you know, six feet and you go.

713
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,799
Scott: Oh, yeah, I can jump six feet.

714
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,080
Scott: It's that self of achievement that I have increased my personal ability, even it's something meaningless.

715
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,416
Scott: I mean the high jump isn't useful.

716
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:44,160
Rym: So it's got someone by beating all those achievements has increased their personal ability at whatever that game was.

717
00:43:44,802 --> 00:43:46,969
Scott: But you can do that without those stupid achievements.

718
00:43:47,029 --> 00:43:50,380
Scott: and but the time is that a lot of you wouldn't be doing it without the.

719
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:52,088
Rym: You keep saying that you don't know that.

720
00:43:52,108 --> 00:43:53,877
Scott: that's what it's looking like to me.

721
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:55,947
Scott: go around the internet Look around look what people are saying.

722
00:43:56,209 --> 00:43:56,792
Rym: you back that up.

723
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:58,200
Rym: You're the one making a positive claim.

724
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,802
Scott: I'm sad.

725
00:43:58,822 --> 00:43:59,143
Scott: So what I've?

726
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:00,649
Scott: that's what I've seen on the internet.

727
00:44:00,669 --> 00:44:04,519
Scott: So these people are saying so some guy on the internet Is your awesome guy in the air?

728
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,805
Scott: It's lots of people on the internet.

729
00:44:05,826 --> 00:44:08,960
Scott: go to gaming blogs where there are articles about achievements and look at the comments.

730
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:10,586
Rym: So you read all those comments?

731
00:44:10,707 --> 00:44:13,960
Rym: I think that's a much bigger waste of time than getting some achievements in portal.

732
00:44:14,342 --> 00:44:15,629
Scott: I'm doing research for this show.

733
00:44:16,152 --> 00:44:17,420
Rym: I'm sure yeah.

734
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,832
Rym: Imagine you just sitting there being righteously indignant fuming into your chair.

735
00:44:21,173 --> 00:44:21,815
Rym: Ah, these people.

736
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:23,100
Rym: Ah, they're so stupid.

737
00:44:23,322 --> 00:44:25,579
Rym: Why can't they all be perfect gods among men like me?

738
00:44:27,005 --> 00:44:30,387
Rym: And you aren't the same way I'm sitting in my air on chair.

739
00:44:30,488 --> 00:44:31,753
Rym: I have no cares in the world.

740
00:44:31,894 --> 00:44:32,115
Rym: Yeah.

741
00:44:32,155 --> 00:44:32,396
Scott: Yeah.

742
00:44:32,516 --> 00:44:35,560
Rym: Yeah I just see nothing wrong with achievements.

743
00:44:35,781 --> 00:44:40,979
Rym: See the thing is your argument is one achievements are stupid and two people who care about them are stupid.

744
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:43,145
Scott: Yep That's my argument But all your.

745
00:44:43,205 --> 00:44:48,706
Rym: the only argument you actually made effectively at all was possibly the second half Achievements in and of themselves.

746
00:44:48,726 --> 00:44:51,076
Rym: There's nothing wrong with that at all zero.

747
00:44:51,136 --> 00:44:52,140
Rym: You can't even make the argument.

748
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,065
Rym: There's anything wrong with it.

749
00:44:53,165 --> 00:44:54,753
Scott: all it is, but they're just nothing.

750
00:44:54,995 --> 00:44:59,500
Scott: if people know They're adding them is adding nothing to the game.

751
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,126
Scott: It's a waste of all they are.

752
00:45:01,147 --> 00:45:04,540
Rym: space is a little system checked on doesn't take anything.

753
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,546
Rym: You don't have to buy into it.

754
00:45:05,566 --> 00:45:06,551
Rym: You don't have to do anything with.

755
00:45:06,592 --> 00:45:08,020
Rym: if you don't want to you can turn it off.

756
00:45:08,282 --> 00:45:09,188
Rym: It's not gonna cancer.

757
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:11,000
Scott: I'm pretty sure you can't turn it off in the Xbox.

758
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:13,595
Scott: You can turn it off and you don't even own an Xbox.

759
00:45:13,636 --> 00:45:14,400
Rym: What do you care?

760
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:18,036
Rym: It's not gonna come into your bedroom and rape you tonight like I'm going to know.

761
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,286
Scott: The point is it does.

762
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:25,597
Scott: I made the point that it does mess with games by putting you into the meta.

763
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:27,934
Scott: it puts this meta Thing over the games themselves.

764
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:30,367
Rym: Oh, yeah, Scott What if people like the meta?

765
00:45:30,588 --> 00:45:32,255
Rym: a lot of people play games met.

766
00:45:32,275 --> 00:45:36,555
Rym: when I play advanced wars I play advanced wars as a series of equations.

767
00:45:36,636 --> 00:45:37,500
Rym: It is nothing but math.

768
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,906
Rym: It is nothing but the meta.

769
00:45:39,268 --> 00:45:46,720
Rym: when I play German board games half the time when I win It's not because of the game or what I'm doing in the game because I'm watching what other people do and playing the meta.

770
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:55,679
Rym: Scott always in T&E for the longest time used to he'd always when he's fiddled with his tiles behind his screen and whenever he had Three or more he'd always fill from the top.

771
00:45:55,941 --> 00:45:56,866
Rym: We ever had two or less.

772
00:45:57,027 --> 00:46:02,193
Rym: he'd always fiddle from the side and he did it perfectly And I was able to beat him a lot before I finally pointed it out.

773
00:46:02,655 --> 00:46:03,600
Rym: That's purely meta.

774
00:46:03,982 --> 00:46:06,372
Rym: Are you saying that's just as bad as achievements in the Xbox?

775
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:09,068
Scott: that has nothing to do with achievements in the Xbox But it's meta.

776
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,520
Rym: I'm playing a game in a meta thing.

777
00:46:10,563 --> 00:46:13,570
Scott: No The reason that the meta is bad is because it takes you.

778
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,340
Scott: it can has the potential to take you out of immersive experience.

779
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,431
Rym: What if someone doesn't care about the immersive experience?

780
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:20,160
Rym: What if they will only care about the skill of the game?

781
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:28,239
Rym: I mean the immersive experience in a game is oftentimes just an FMV or a scripted pseudo FMV.

782
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:41,613
Scott: If you care about the skill of a game Then you will get your enjoyment from the self of a comp the sense of accomplishment you get when you build your skill And you don't need an imaginary illusion of a carrot to convince you to keep playing the game.

783
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:45,988
Scott: if you are only playing a game because of an Illusionary carrot then why?

784
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:51,954
Scott: and you're not actually having fun with the game itself And you're only having fun in the pursuit of the illusionary carrot.

785
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:53,120
Scott: What are you doing?

786
00:46:54,241 --> 00:46:58,900
Rym: There's a lot of hard video games where a lot of people don't enjoy them except the chat.

787
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:00,620
Rym: It's so hard or so difficult.

788
00:47:01,002 --> 00:47:06,265
Rym: the only carrot they get is the fact that they stuck to it even though it wasn't fun and Then they beat it.

789
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:09,240
Rym: and that not fun translates into double fun, right?

790
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:14,136
Scott: And there's no reason you don't need these illusionary achievement carrots to have that.

791
00:47:14,277 --> 00:47:16,445
Rym: I didn't say you need them However, and they don't help.

792
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:27,761
Rym: However, let's say it's a person who yeah, they are enjoying it All right Now if they're gonna enjoy it and they're doing these things because they want the challenge and for nothing more than because they enjoy the Challenge.

793
00:47:28,463 --> 00:47:36,366
Rym: why not have an extra system if they want it that allows them to one prove that they did it and two Give them direction on what to do.

794
00:47:36,426 --> 00:47:39,597
Rym: and three to make prove to themselves that they did it right.

795
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:42,391
Rym: in some games It's hard to tell or keep track.

796
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:44,000
Rym: It'd be easy to fudge it a little bit.

797
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,780
Rym: It forces you to keep honest with yourself and actually achieve it legitimately.

798
00:47:48,121 --> 00:47:51,074
Rym: So when you do, you know without a doubt that look I did it.

799
00:47:51,154 --> 00:47:53,544
Rym: even if you never show it to anyone You've got proof.

800
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:56,856
Rym: the game says you did exactly what you set out to do.

801
00:47:57,217 --> 00:48:02,460
Rym: if you don't have that There's a chance that you might accidentally screw it up and you might not have done something as difficult as you thought you did.

802
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:05,330
Scott: It doesn't matter if you can prove you did what you did.

803
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,052
Scott: That's anyone.

804
00:48:06,173 --> 00:48:08,140
Scott: all that matters is that you had fun doing it.

805
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,040
Rym: Yes, but at the same time what if you have more fun by knowing that you did it, right?

806
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,112
Scott: You have more fun because you prove that you did something.

807
00:48:15,232 --> 00:48:17,100
Rym: No because that you'd know that you did it, right?

808
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,700
Rym: What if there was a bug in Doom 2 and I was playing and I thought I beat the game.

809
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:27,420
Rym: I'm playing to beat the game on the hardest difficulty level and I finally beat it and I had fun.

810
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,600
Rym: But it turns out that I was playing on the easiest difficulty level and I was just stupid and said it wrong.

811
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,127
Scott: That was just you being stupid.

812
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:33,690
Rym: All right.

813
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,132
Rym: So what if?

814
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:35,820
Rym: why not have a system that prevents that?

815
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,489
Scott: That the achievements don't prevent that.

816
00:48:38,509 --> 00:48:40,940
Scott: Yeah, they do don't prevent you from choosing the wrong.

817
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:45,915
Rym: You can't get the achievement unless you actually accomplish the thing.

818
00:48:46,076 --> 00:48:47,905
Scott: when you beat doom on hard It says you beat it.

819
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,080
Scott: You get a different ending than when you beat doom on easy.

820
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,703
Scott: No, you don't.

821
00:48:50,864 --> 00:48:52,794
Scott: it says it doesn't say you know hard.

822
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:53,859
Rym: Do you don't get shit?

823
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,512
Scott: Somehow yeah, then that's just.

824
00:48:56,592 --> 00:48:57,660
Scott: that's just something wrong with the game.

825
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,216
Scott: The achievement system is not a system that solves that problem.

826
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:00,639
Rym: Why not?

827
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,500
Rym: All the achievement system is is hey, hey, you've already beaten the game.

828
00:49:05,781 --> 00:49:06,484
Rym: You already own it.

829
00:49:06,885 --> 00:49:08,190
Rym: check out all these things you can do.

830
00:49:08,431 --> 00:49:09,897
Rym: we guarantee that they're possible.

831
00:49:10,138 --> 00:49:10,580
Rym: Good luck.

832
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:11,865
Scott: Yeah, you get it.

833
00:49:11,885 --> 00:49:12,729
Scott: You can just why not?

834
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:13,793
Scott: just have bonus modes.

835
00:49:13,813 --> 00:49:16,223
Scott: You don't need this achievement system Achievement.

836
00:49:16,243 --> 00:49:18,632
Scott: you don't need this meta system outside of the game to handle it.

837
00:49:18,893 --> 00:49:19,817
Rym: Just have why not?

838
00:49:20,118 --> 00:49:20,560
Rym: why not?

839
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,874
Rym: It's it's just instead of having a why what do you say?

840
00:49:23,914 --> 00:49:24,276
Scott: Why not?

841
00:49:24,356 --> 00:49:25,260
Scott: Why why have it?

842
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,020
Scott: Why not just have bonus modes and games the way we've had them for years and years and years?

843
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,900
Scott: Why do we need this meta system outside of the game to handle that in some sort of organized scoring way?

844
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,496
Rym: Well, apparently because a lot of people want that.

845
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:42,780
Scott: they do Because it's an illusionary carrot and it works on most people and I don't respect that.

846
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:55,299
Rym: So your argument is that the quote illusionary carrot of an achievement is somehow Less real than the illusionary carrot of a princess that was kidnapped by a big turtle with spikes.

847
00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:58,306
Rym: Yes That's ludicrous, oh it's not.

848
00:49:58,788 --> 00:49:59,531
Rym: I think it is.

849
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,000
Rym: I think you take this way too seriously.

850
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,810
Scott: I basically take the illusionary carrot thing way too seriously.

851
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,235
Rym: Uh, yeah, that's it.

852
00:50:06,275 --> 00:50:06,576
Scott: That's all.

853
00:50:06,596 --> 00:50:07,982
Scott: I don't take the achievement thing It's.

854
00:50:08,103 --> 00:50:09,799
Scott: it's just the achievement thing happens to be.

855
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:12,999
Scott: No, they're not.

856
00:50:15,661 --> 00:50:20,239
Rym: How so I already explained how many times I explain this because I don't agree with what you said at all.

857
00:50:20,921 --> 00:50:22,446
Scott: You're playing Tetris right.

858
00:50:22,727 --> 00:50:24,814
Scott: beating Tetris is is actually you.

859
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:25,838
Scott: you're accomplishing something.

860
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:26,480
Scott: you're increasing.

861
00:50:26,661 --> 00:50:28,790
Scott: You have to have skill in order to do it.

862
00:50:29,232 --> 00:50:32,458
Rym: Scott to get some of those achievements You have to have a lot of skill to do it.

863
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:35,628
Scott: Yes But I don't need someone to tell me that I don't need.

864
00:50:36,149 --> 00:50:46,720
Scott: if it was actually fun if there was actually some Building of skill that building of skill is enough to motivate me so all of my skill and it's enough to provide me.

865
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,787
Rym: You run a marathon.

866
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,292
Rym: what if you run a marathon?

867
00:50:50,412 --> 00:50:53,452
Rym: or you run a marathon and at the end there's a guy who says wow You're at a marathon.

868
00:50:53,492 --> 00:50:53,919
Rym: That's great.

869
00:50:54,442 --> 00:50:56,932
Rym: Now doesn't cost you anything to have that guy there?

870
00:50:56,952 --> 00:51:08,293
Rym: the guys either there or not If you're if you're going to run the marathon because no Scott I'm going to say that's a separate argument Because what I'm trying to say is your argument is a whole different thing.

871
00:51:08,313 --> 00:51:10,738
Rym: The achievements themselves are not a problem They're just a tool.

872
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:17,525
Rym: I'm like any other tool in gaming that the achievements are just a guy at the end of the game saying great and Without that guy there.

873
00:51:17,846 --> 00:51:18,689
Rym: It's still the same game.

874
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:19,552
Rym: There's just not a guy.

875
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:21,840
Rym: How does having the guy there hurt you?

876
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,425
Scott: It doesn't hurt me.

877
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:24,932
Scott: I'm not saying it hurts me.

878
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:26,520
Rym: How does it hurt anyone?

879
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,095
Rym: The reason you want to plays for just you know, the enjoyment of playing.

880
00:51:30,136 --> 00:51:30,779
Rym: How does it hurt them?

881
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:35,360
Scott: If you're playing actually for the enjoyment of playing then you don't need the guy.

882
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,363
Scott: So why have him there?

883
00:51:36,905 --> 00:51:39,334
Scott: but you're playing for the guy, but it's then.

884
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,186
Scott: if you're only playing for that guy Why are you playing?

885
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,600
Rym: but Scott if the guy is arbitrary whether he's there or not?

886
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,176
Rym: Then why it doesn't matter if he's there or not?

887
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:48,329
Rym: So why not have him doesn't?

888
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,340
Scott: why have him and he does hurt?

889
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,600
Scott: I already explained how it can hurt by taking you out of the immersion of a game.

890
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:59,153
Rym: But Scott if all people don't care about that Not everyone has the same taste in games you do yes, and I disrespect them.

891
00:51:59,755 --> 00:52:01,120
Scott: how many times you had to go through this.

892
00:52:01,281 --> 00:52:04,900
Rym: I just still can't get over the fact that you would disrespect someone because their choice in video games.

893
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:14,840
Scott: If I see someone putting effort towards achieving something I don't want to use the word achieving to make it confusing but I have to but achieving something that is not Worthwhile, okay.

894
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:24,340
Rym: So someone with a PhD in nuclear physics sees you playing Mario 3 and thinks why is that boy wasting his valuable time on this?

895
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:31,220
Scott: I may not be achieving as much as the PhD that is obvious, but not achieving any more than someone getting an Xbox achieve?

896
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:32,108
Scott: No, I am.

897
00:52:32,169 --> 00:52:32,734
Scott: No, you're not.

898
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:33,198
Scott: Yes, I am.

899
00:52:34,403 --> 00:52:36,660
Scott: My enjoyment is not coming from an illusion.

900
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,019
Scott: My enjoyment is coming from an actual building of skill within myself.

901
00:52:40,942 --> 00:52:45,955
Rym: Want to think that Mario 3 is somehow nobler than some Xbox achievement.

902
00:52:45,975 --> 00:52:52,419
Rym: you can keep thinking that it is Okay, if what the difference is is that if you're getting the enjoyment, what do you care?

903
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,946
Scott: It cuz it's all about where the enjoyment comes.

904
00:52:54,987 --> 00:52:59,805
Rym: why you care if someone's into BDSM and that's how they get their rocks off Huh?

905
00:52:59,865 --> 00:53:00,572
Rym: What do you care?

906
00:53:00,592 --> 00:53:01,399
Scott: I don't care.

907
00:53:02,143 --> 00:53:12,412
Scott: The point is is that if you get your enjoyment from the achievement Obviously care because you keep talking You keep basically I explain things already and you keep.

908
00:53:12,552 --> 00:53:13,596
Scott: you're not getting my point.

909
00:53:13,656 --> 00:53:14,860
Rym: Well, no I get your point.

910
00:53:14,981 --> 00:53:16,751
Rym: I think your point silly and I disagree with it.

911
00:53:16,972 --> 00:53:18,200
Rym: I'm gonna be with your evidence.

912
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,403
Scott: I'm gonna conclude with this so you freaking understand what I'm saying and stop confusing me and try it's trying to put words in my Mouth.

913
00:53:23,443 --> 00:53:24,399
Rym: no, I understand it.

914
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,223
Rym: I just disagree with.

915
00:53:25,324 --> 00:53:25,424
Rym: if

916
00:53:25,464 --> 00:53:43,163
Scott: you're getting enjoyment from the actual sense of accomplishment of Defeating a challenge of overcoming obstacles Then you don't need some little light to turn on to get more enjoyment If you are getting your enjoyment from the light turning on and you're not actually getting enjoyment from the things that you're doing to get The light to turn on.

917
00:53:43,484 --> 00:53:44,769
Scott: why the fuck are you doing them?

918
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,717
Scott: The achievement system is unnecessary.

919
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:50,060
Scott: You might say oh Well, it doesn't hurt anything.

920
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:56,460
Scott: Well, I just gave one example of where it could potentially hurt and I have shown that is absolutely not necessary.

921
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,887
Scott: Therefore why is it Scott?

922
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:00,294
Rym: I don't think that that hurts at all.

923
00:54:00,354 --> 00:54:01,479
