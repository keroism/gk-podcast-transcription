00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,287
Rym: It's Wednesday November 17th.

2
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:12,029
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:15,220
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight Looney Tunes.

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,236
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:25,782
Scott: 2010.

6
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:27,588
Rym: no you jerk I point out.

7
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:28,391
Rym: the listeners want it.

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,218
Scott: They just want whatever.

9
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:32,005
Rym: I don't want Ah, but they want it.

10
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:33,652
Scott: I should have acted like oh, man.

11
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:34,235
Scott: That was awesome.

12
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:35,480
Scott: How you did the date, and then you would have.

13
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,293
Rym: So is it awesome?

14
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:39,996
Rym: should I keep doing it?

15
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:46,619
Scott: no well Because now the cats already out of the bag so whether whichever way I go it won't work.

16
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:48,165
Scott: You know what I want.

17
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:50,573
Scott: You know I've revealed my true desires.

18
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,817
Scott: therefore it can.

19
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:55,231
Scott: there is no Possible way I can conceal them again.

20
00:00:55,251 --> 00:01:03,200
Rym: see now the important thing is that I win But you forget you you have to be a master of instilling doubt when there is no possible doubt.

21
00:01:03,562 --> 00:01:06,178
Rym: This is the art of the person who ran the RIT anime club.

22
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:06,440
Rym: where?

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,118
Rym: When a show was accidentally spoiled for someone you had to be able to instill doubt To where they wouldn't know if it was spoiled or not.

24
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:18,255
Scott: yes That is that is thing is it depends on the specific thing right?

25
00:01:18,355 --> 00:01:19,520
Scott: so at this point?

26
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,757
Scott: There is no way nothing that could possibly be said that would convince you that I actually are you sure?

27
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:29,536
Rym: I mean I can Probably instill doubt in most of my most closely held ideals.

28
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:35,649
Scott: if I really needed to Yeah, but it's like you've already told someone Very can be.

29
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,260
Scott: even you do ranted about it.

30
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,020
Scott: How could you possibly convince someone that you changed your mind so suddenly you know like maybe a year from now?

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,020
Scott: I could be like yeah, you know looking back adding that year was actually a good idea.

32
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:53,297
Rym: Here's why it doesn't work on me because if you said that I'd say awesome cool.

33
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:55,248
Rym: We'll keep doing it Yeah, and you say no.

34
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:56,476
Rym: I'll say I'm the audio editor.

35
00:01:56,496 --> 00:02:01,840
Scott: We'll keep doing it Yeah, anyway, so I went to this conference today, which sucked.

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,919
Scott: I don't really want to talk about it.

37
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:07,293
Rym: 99 for all you guys to go to anime cons and nerd cons and packs and everything.

38
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:13,649
Rym: packs is greater than all cons and Like anime cons are greater than all cons that aren't.

39
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:14,532
Scott: I mean it had some.

40
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:20,394
Scott: it was Monday Tuesday and today right today was the Workshop day and there were good parts and bad parts and it sat and it apparently is.

41
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:26,214
Scott: the workshop that I was not in Was probably a better workshop judging by the noises that were coming out of that room.

42
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:27,640
Rym: wow that's like you're an anime con.

43
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:38,100
Rym: You're watching some dumb panel on like I don't know Italia Crossplay making out and across the hall you just hear people screaming as gogo 13 shoots people and you can't go over there.

44
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:45,900
Scott: Yeah, there's no way anime con you can switch hallways, but when you signed up for a specific workshop You can't switch the people sitting behind me our workshop so that workshop.

45
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:53,660
Scott: They've got sniper rifles, and you're taking turns doing what go go well It was also interesting how like there are people there who obviously came from far.

46
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:56,334
Scott: I really feel bad for anyone came from far away because it was not.

47
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:57,540
Scott: it was only good for us.

48
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,700
Scott: Cuz the venue for the one part was actually right in your office and the venue for the workshops was you know also pretty close.

49
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:09,431
Scott: I actually there are people who were in there with their luggage And they picked it up and left like in the middle of the day.

50
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:11,700
Scott: some people left like after the first break.

51
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,087
Scott: They were like oh man fuck this.

52
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:13,831
Scott: They just they.

53
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,459
Scott: they bolted at the first chance.

54
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:17,285
Scott: You know they just did not return.

55
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:27,280
Rym: I found in my life that I almost every conference or convention I ever attend I Feel bad for the people who came that had to pay and travel to get there.

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,356
Scott: Yeah, I mean my work paid which is the only.

57
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,780
Rym: yeah, yeah I would not go to SIFMA if I had to pay money to go to SIFMA.

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,745
Rym: Yeah First instead SIFMA pays me.

59
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:37,868
Scott: the thing is doesn't?

60
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,554
Scott: doesn't SIFMA have like?

61
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:43,047
Scott: it's the kind of thing where you walk around like a trade Show right you walk around the booth.

62
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,780
Rym: No it also has workshops and lectures.

63
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,968
Scott: Yeah, this was literally right.

64
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,180
Scott: basically the first two days were two panel rooms.

65
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:59,737
Scott: well actually two theaters right and The very limited programming in the second theater, and you basically had to choose between one of the.

66
00:03:59,777 --> 00:04:00,540
Scott: you know every slot.

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,934
Scott: You either choose one theater or the other and that was pretty much it.

68
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:08,390
Scott: and in terms of booths There was like five little stands with PR people.

69
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,193
Scott: I didn't even talk to them.

70
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:11,360
Scott: Yeah, right and there weren't even booths.

71
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:15,747
Scott: It was just like a guy at a table with a laptop You know trying to sell his dick I guess as much as we complain about.

72
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:20,712
Scott: and then on the third day was a workshop all day And you had to pick which one beforehand.

73
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:39,626
Scott: and a thing is Everyone sort of knew who the people running the workshops are but I didn't know who they were so I ended up picking a not good one just based on the title and It wasn't even a workshop is basically an all-day powerpoint And it's like the other people had a workshop where they fucking made something and I was like god damn it This isn't a workshop.

74
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,340
Rym: Hey that was the one at least at Connecticut.

75
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:45,315
Rym: We only had like two or three workshops that weren't actually workshop.

76
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,680
Scott: the thing is these are all internet e people.

77
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,900
Scott: So I'm gonna write a blog post about how they saw how it's terrible.

78
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:52,168
Scott: There were good parts, right?

79
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:54,540
Scott: Obviously the other workshop was probably good.

80
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:57,989
Scott: I didn't go to right and obviously it you know a lot.

81
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:03,667
Scott: there were parts that I didn't like because I'm mostly a Programmer and it was obviously designer.

82
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:05,996
Scott: It was a web design thing primarily.

83
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:12,740
Scott: So a lot of it I was just like oh god, right and you know, so part of it was me and there were some good talks.

84
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,880
Scott: I went to a bunch of the talks Monday and Tuesday and some were good.

85
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:26,200
Scott: but some and even the ones that were Maybe I didn't like they were still well presented like they had speaking skills and presentation skills.

86
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:29,371
Scott: It's just they didn't actually present any useful information there.

87
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,054
Scott: Well, that's the.

88
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:31,680
Scott: obviously they're basically pep talks.

89
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,652
Rym: That's what I'm usually running into like look at packs where like some video game programmer people They have a lot of interesting stuff to say.

90
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,980
Rym: they just don't know how to speak in.

91
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,084
Scott: No, there were these guys.

92
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:45,620
Scott: there are these designers and they had these their presentations like amazing because they're designers, right?

93
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:50,960
Scott: And they're the things that their presentation skills were off the charts, right?

94
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,082
Scott: They were enthusiastic and they they weren't, you know, only one person showed any nervousness You know.

95
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,460
Scott: and they were exciting and energetic and like oh go get him, right?

96
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,960
Scott: But all they were saying was like I'm not even a designer, right?

97
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,864
Scott: I'm a programmer.

98
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:16,256
Scott: and they were saying the same stuff like oh man Look at Apple and how they're designed so awesome and you know You'd know that something is right when you have nothing left to take away.

99
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:18,728
Scott: it's like a G. I've never heard that quote before.

100
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:20,940
Scott: why don't you devote another five minutes to it, right?

101
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,920
Scott: They didn't actually I mean theoretically the room was supposed to be full of web designers, right?

102
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,223
Scott: Why don't you?

103
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:31,080
Scott: I guess this is the kind of stuff that's gonna be in the blog post, right?

104
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:39,700
Scott: I don't want to waste it all now But you know the primary thing that bothered me above all other complaints is that listen This is a conference of designers, right?

105
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:42,376
Scott: You have to assume that everyone is coming is already designer.

106
00:06:42,396 --> 00:06:43,705
Scott: These are not nubs These are not.

107
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:48,000
Rym: people have never designed a day in their life Like, you know, we got X we do a lecture on you know game theory.

108
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,929
Rym: We assume you've played some goddamn game, right?

109
00:06:50,949 --> 00:07:02,820
Scott: You have to assume that we're not like gaming these and in the fifth century Assume that the people in the audience have like, you know, some of them probably have like masters or degrees in design, right?

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:14,119
Scott: so telling them this nothing stuff or just a pep talk that's really energetic is not worth the Price that they or their employers paid for them to show up, right?

111
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:21,100
Scott: So What you need to do is you need to actually give us something of actual substance.

112
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:26,298
Rym: So Scott, I've been to one I do not know already technology convention my entire life.

113
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:31,531
Rym: that met that Pangorcon the second Pangorcon in Novi, Michigan.

114
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:34,099
Rym: That was the best technology convention I've ever attended.

115
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:34,540
Scott: I agree.

116
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:39,013
Rym: What we should start speaking at tech conventions, I guess I

117
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:52,532
Scott: think the thing is when it comes to tech and Meetups though the ones that I like the most the ones that I've been to right are these little things in the city We go to right where you actually where everyone says stuff to everyone It's like, you know, and it's just the networking right?

118
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:57,647
Scott: Like something like open everything Talking about right is is the?

119
00:07:57,828 --> 00:07:59,694
Scott: you know, I mean it's something like what I went to.

120
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:05,924
Scott: people might show up for the networking But it's like I even have the talking just have the networking and that's it just have like a meetup right?

121
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,672
Scott: or you look at something like PyCon right.

122
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:17,100
Scott: you go to PyCon, which is a Python conference usually in Europe and While there is there are talks and lightning rounds and all these sorts of things.

123
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,612
Scott: There's also people coding.

124
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:21,160
Scott: they do stuff there, right?

125
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,016
Scott: It's the equivalent of like tabletop at PAX is coding and actually making stuff at PyCon.

126
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:28,380
Rym: So it's desktop.

127
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,960
Scott: So it's yeah, right So but there was no designing going on at least I think there was in the other workshop.

128
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:38,008
Rym: But then I see that other workshop.

129
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:41,200
Scott: that's where everything was I know but that was only one out of three days, right?

130
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:51,190
Scott: So, I mean while there was good stuff that I was missing and what you know It was like there were problems at this thing and if I had paid for it with my own money I or traveled a great distance.

131
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,860
Scott: I would have been very upset.

132
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:55,690
Rym: What said is I can still say everything that you said.

133
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:59,484
Rym: just change some of the proper nouns about many of the anime and gaming I've attended in my life.

134
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:02,915
Scott: What well, you can't say that there's really good presenters with.

135
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:05,206
Scott: you know, what useful information There are.

136
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:09,899
Rym: there are as I will point out Daryl Surratt Jared Rathkal, they have useful information.

137
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:12,807
Rym: You me Mike tool.

138
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,071
Scott: We all have useful information.

139
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,095
Scott: What are you talking about?

140
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:15,376
Scott: Actually?

141
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:19,376
Scott: No, except for you and me We don't have useful information now, but all the other people do we just?

142
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:28,180
Rym: I think it was Luke Who said we have an amazing ability in panel rooms to bowl people over and whether they agree agree with us or not They feel like they should by the end even if we're wrong.

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,296
Scott: But we're actually giving information or at least making a case the people.

144
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:35,426
Scott: a lot of the talks I went to are pretty much just like rah.

145
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:36,309
Scott: rah design.

146
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,498
Scott: Oh and every single thing I went to there was ie6 hating.

147
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:45,580
Scott: It's like that's all web designers could talk about all day long every all three days was we hate isaac?

148
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,746
Scott: So I 60 and I six.

149
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:48,838
Scott: it's like we know everyone here hates ie6.

150
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,930
Scott: We don't need to keep saying it a thousand times.

151
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:52,633
Scott: I hate it too.

152
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:53,336
Scott: You hate it.

153
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:54,058
Scott: We all hate it.

154
00:09:54,721 --> 00:10:00,629
Scott: Shut up, you don't need to say in every single panel and every single workshop 10 every 10 minutes Oh, but what about ie6?

155
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:01,052
Scott: ie6 sucks?

156
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:03,644
Scott: Ruins my day.

157
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:04,408
Scott: What's you know, you know?

158
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,298
Scott: Hey, what's the worst thing about your job ie6?

159
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,500
Rym: This reminds me of back and way back.

160
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,974
Rym: We were at an Otakon and we're at the feedback ceremony one by one.

161
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:19,659
Rym: everyone comes up and they're like I've been coming to Otakon for 15 years and I've been coming to Otakon for 11 years and this is my 20th Otakon.

162
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,337
Rym: and Our friend Pete goes up there and he's like I've been coming to Otakon for 500 years.

163
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,057
Rym: And I feel like if you were talking at that conference, you should be like yeah mosaic that fucker.

164
00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:35,720
Scott: They talked about mosaic But they talked about it, you know, it's a historical thing.

165
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,549
Scott: You know the way we'll.

166
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,400
Scott: when we talk about something We'll start with the oldest thing to be historical and show you a progression.

167
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,694
Scott: They started at mosaic when I wait whenever they needed to talk about progression.

168
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:45,180
Scott: They tell you started with mosaic.

169
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:54,014
Rym: I don't know why they didn't start with links at a web conference or everyone probably already knew anyway, exact I don't think the listeners on Wednesday night care much about that.

170
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:55,320
Scott: No, that's just what bothered me today.

171
00:10:55,441 --> 00:11:03,687
Scott: Yeah, but anyway Oh, wow That was a tangent actually because what I really wanted to talk about was that today when I was at the workshops on 59th in Lexington across the street.

172
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,309
Rym: Holy shit.

173
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:05,755
Rym: There's actually a link here.

174
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:07,220
Rym: This is actually relevant.

175
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:12,955
Scott: Yeah, Wow across the street from the workshops was the Argosy gallery.

176
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:14,580
Scott: All right, you know what this is.

177
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,709
Rym: I have no idea what the Argosy gallery.

178
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:23,491
Scott: It is a store right which sells Argosy books prints paintings and maps right?

179
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:24,695
Scott: I went in there.

180
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:31,360
Scott: They had books from like the 15th century just on the shelf.

181
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,029
Scott: I was like what it's like.

182
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,040
Scott: this place should be a museum, but it's a store.

183
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,369
Scott: There's a place like that the newest.

184
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,196
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, you're on 59th Street.

185
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:42,240
Rym: I think I know where you were.

186
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,924
Rym: This place was that?

187
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:46,514
Rym: wait this place also have Greek pottery.

188
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:47,377
Rym: no, okay.

189
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:48,240
Rym: There's another player.

190
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,725
Scott: This is the place on the street view.

191
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:50,026
Scott: see it.

192
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:50,848
Rym: Okay.

193
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:54,580
Rym: There's another place on 59th Street that sells actual Greek pottery.

194
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,586
Scott: Oh my god, I gotta go there.

195
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:56,029
Scott: Yeah.

196
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,760
Scott: Yeah, we have to go to this place.

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,120
Rym: Well, I guess technically I mean there is pottery from Greece in the 70s, but this Argosy place, right?

198
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:09,170
Scott: Not only were they selling like books right and apparently the newest books they had were like As old as the books that are unlike my grandma's shelf.

199
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,113
Scott: That was the newest books.

200
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,780
Scott: They had were like 80s books, right?

201
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:22,140
Scott: But they had stuff they're like, yeah Here's a letter from the desk of FDR's secretary in a plastic sleeve for $35 and it's just like it's just sitting there.

202
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:29,540
Scott: It's like oh, no, not that much money No, but I'm saying is like they got that kind of stuff is like just all over the place.

203
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,720
Rym: I should get something weird like that and just leave it out.

204
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,445
Scott: But yeah, we had to.

205
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,540
Scott: it's like we had to go to this place.

206
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:43,968
Scott: You got to see it and it's it's weird because this build this building has many floors, right and it actually uses all the floors It's not and they have a really old elevator to go up.

207
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,060
Rym: Oh, so this isn't actually linked to anime manga or comics.

208
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:49,755
Scott: No, oh, I thought that it was just.

209
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:59,810
Scott: that was the thing I actually wanted to talk about in my opening bit But I forgot because I started by saying I was at a workshop and across the street was the thing But I got stuck on the workshop because the workshop was.

210
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,356
Scott: it took a while to get across the street.

211
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:05,504
Rym: Yeah So there's a little bit of anime news But I do want to.

212
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:08,502
Rym: I have two geek bite points to make Point.

213
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:14,259
Rym: the first when we reviewed Eden of the East Scott had seen it all and I've seen all but the last two episodes.

214
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:14,620
Scott: now.

215
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,644
Scott: Oh, you've seen the last episode.

216
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:16,808
Rym: Yeah, what the fuck.

217
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,079
Rym: that was the most disappointing show I've ever seen.

218
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,992
Rym: Because shows that are worse at least are not disappointing.

219
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:26,476
Scott: Yeah, I mean basically what.

220
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:27,799
Rym: why didn't you tell me?

221
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,284
Rym: Why didn't you warn me?

222
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:30,971
Rym: You were like, yeah, it was B anime was okay.

223
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:32,155
Rym: You were going along with.

224
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:33,199
Rym: no fuck that show.

225
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:36,028
Rym: Really that end was like.

226
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,440
Rym: it was a B anime with a B end, but it could have been an a anime.

227
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,480
Rym: That's worse than just being a B anime.

228
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,244
Scott: Oh you think so.

229
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:49,280
Rym: you could have been an a and you weren't because Kamehama just apparently is only good when he takes other people's works and reimagine them.

230
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:52,149
Scott: I mean the situation is right.

231
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:53,012
Scott: is that you got this?

232
00:13:53,092 --> 00:13:58,914
Scott: the beginning is so promising right in the end It does not live up to the promise right, but it's not a bad end.

233
00:13:58,955 --> 00:13:59,899
Scott: It just doesn't live up.

234
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:03,352
Scott: But here's here's why it had lived up.

235
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:05,380
Scott: it would have been a so because it didn't live up.

236
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,740
Rym: Here's why it's a bad ending.

237
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,039
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about how the whole clothes like all the things I already talked about on the show.

238
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:10,687
Rym: It's sad.

239
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:17,539
Rym: reason number one They did the same bullshit that Gundam C did where they unkill a character for no reason except fan service.

240
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:22,554
Rym: They unkill the character and they show them to you for two seconds to be like check it out.

241
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:27,699
Rym: Not dead moving on All right, that was BS to the end.

242
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:33,500
Rym: Didn't make sense it that none of that would have worked and nothing was resolved?

243
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:37,307
Scott: Like no, I mean there was a result.

244
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:41,646
Scott: I think the thing is is that there was so much that was unresolved, you know There's so many.

245
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:46,747
Rym: the end was so stylistically beautiful Like it felt like the end of standalone complex.

246
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:51,298
Rym: except imagine if the end of standalone complex didn't resolve anything at all.

247
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,526
Rym: Yeah Fuck that show.

248
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:56,599
Rym: That was the most disappointing anime I've seen in a day.

249
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:58,831
Scott: I think it's like a Death Note situation.

250
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:00,260
Scott: right people hate the second half of death.

251
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:06,820
Scott: Some people do right, but I think but really if that second half of Death Note is actually good It's just the first half is great.

252
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:11,499
Scott: So you think when you're putting and they're in the same work with the same title, right you go.

253
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:16,140
Scott: Oh, man, this is terrible because you get your reference point is is shifted, right?

254
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,980
Scott: So you see now in this case though if the second half of Death Note was its own manga on its own People wouldn't be like hating on it so much.

255
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:38,665
Rym: First half of Death Note was an A and the second half was a B. this was a B show that the first three episodes were a and The entire second half of the show was C so it averaged out to a B. that's way different from like scrap princess, which was just a Standard generic B.

256
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:51,113
Scott: and the thing is I will actually in my you know, my personal taste I will take that over these shows that are C C C C C C C C C C C or even F F F And then become a at the very end.

257
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:52,320
Rym: fuck that go go go.

258
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,757
Scott: I'm not sitting through right because I if it's good at least in the beginning and turns to crap.

259
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:57,660
Scott: That's okay.

260
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,784
Rym: I should have stopped cuz

261
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:12,280
Scott: I remember it's like I got my goodness and that goodness will is like is like coal in the steam in The engine that will power me through and I can just sort of slide down the bad parts if I get before as long as It's not terrible for a very long time.

262
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,385
Scott: Like if it was many episodes like let's say it was 50 episodes and it gets bad at episode 10.

263
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:17,140
Scott: I'll just stop watching.

264
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,521
Rym: Well, this show did like noir did this to the first episode of noir was one of the most awesome and promising things I'd seen.

265
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:28,420
Scott: yeah, noir is the perfect example of gets bad like episode five six, right?

266
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,080
Rym: That show was like a a B C F nuns with guns.

267
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:39,138
Scott: It's like if it's bad for the beginning I mean if it's good from the beginning I can watch it and I'm watching good stuff.

268
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:39,720
Rym: So what do I care?

269
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:47,360
Rym: Heck episode 1 a. episode 2 B episode 3 through the end blah blah blah key over the Twilight.

270
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:51,680
Scott: So if it gets bad, I can just stop watching and know that it's just bad.

271
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:54,540
Scott: Right, but and I've still watched I only watched good parts.

272
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,959
Scott: So I'm safe this show was so short that I was able to make it to the end.

273
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:06,880
Scott: But if a show is bad and as a promise of being good, that means there's a chance I might be slogging through shit and at the other end more shit.

274
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:08,646
Scott: So you can't right?

275
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,479
Scott: so in that case, right it's like.

276
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:17,400
Scott: You know the the the payoff you're basically risking a payoff and watching our ton of shit in the end.

277
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,520
Scott: What is good at the beginning?

278
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,334
Scott: It doesn't matter if it turns to shit because you can stop watching and you're not.

279
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:22,440
Scott: you never watch the shit.

280
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:22,861
Rym: It's just.

281
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:28,840
Rym: there's the difference like we always say like a anime B anime C anime, but really B anime are in two classes.

282
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:33,811
Rym: There's the B anime that's consistently B Maybe with some peaks some a episode some C episodes.

283
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:36,240
Rym: and there's the B anime like Eden of the East.

284
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,959
Rym: There's only B because the first episode a balances out the ease at the end.

285
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,907
Rym: Ease whoa, not quite an E.

286
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:45,153
Scott: I think if they're like C.

287
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,860
Rym: It was a solid C at the end.

288
00:17:46,962 --> 00:18:01,010
Rym: Yeah I mean at least gang kotsuo had the good graces to be really awesome Until the end and then just fuck up just the end as opposed to the long slow Peter out that even at the East head Any of these wasn't that long which helped it out.

289
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:03,440
Rym: true last exile did that - it was awesome.

290
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,960
Rym: And in the very end, which is kind of like what and notice how that show also unkilled someone for no reason.

291
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,143
Scott: Yeah, the very it was thing is last exile was good right up into the final episode which didn't resolve enough Climactically enough.

292
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:18,853
Rym: Yep, and also unkilled people and killed people stupidly.

293
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:23,225
Scott: Yeah, so anyway, so I News, let's do news.

294
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:25,232
Rym: I got one more thing to say another geek bite.

295
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,516
Rym: I'm rewatching try gun.

296
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:27,640
Rym: Okay, it's good show.

297
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:28,764
Rym: Yeah, I like it.

298
00:18:28,964 --> 00:18:34,503
Rym: Yeah, however, I had not seen try gun since we were freshmen RIT.

299
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:36,900
Scott: I seen it more recently, but even so it's been a while.

300
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,815
Scott: But I watched it many times at the time.

301
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:39,359
Scott: I did watch it.

302
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:45,560
Rym: So what I want to say is that it's a good show, but I don't know if I still put it in a category.

303
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,647
Scott: Yeah, I think it's b-plus.

304
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:49,432
Scott: It was always at the bottom of the a cat.

305
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:53,445
Rym: Yeah, it was but watching it again it It's interesting how.

306
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:57,740
Rym: I think I remember I'd seen try try gun before I saw cowboy bebop all the way through.

307
00:18:58,322 --> 00:19:01,880
Rym: I think that is the primary reason why I held it in such high esteem.

308
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:04,131
Rym: The only reason I bring this up is still a good show.

309
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:05,500
Rym: I got to finish for about halfway through.

310
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,511
Rym: We just got to the episode with the Cyclops.

311
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:08,175
Rym: I really like her.

312
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:12,935
Rym: Mm-hmm But I think this is the first time I've had a show.

313
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:14,180
Rym: usually, you know, I like Ava.

314
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,114
Rym: I'm like, oh I like that shows a kid, but maybe it's not good now that I watch.

315
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,240
Rym: I'm like, oh that shows brilliant.

316
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:20,731
Rym: Yep, every show I've rewatched until now.

317
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:21,555
Rym: I've been like, yes.

318
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:31,439
Rym: In fact, not only is it brilliant It's more brilliant than I realized like Evangelion was way more brilliant than I remember or even irresponsible captain Tyler Like that is in my top three right now.

319
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:33,665
Rym: Yeah, you didn't finish it.

320
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:34,589
Scott: I don't put it up there.

321
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:37,760
Rym: Ah, if you watch all the way through I watched enough.

322
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:39,094
Rym: Ah, no, you didn't.

323
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:42,640
Rym: Anyway, try gun a mine is b-plus.

324
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:51,335
Rym: We'll see how it goes because I forgot how long the kind of Tezuka style non sequitur crazy Characters always going off model beginning was.

325
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:56,375
Scott: yeah Well, there's also you know, there's a whole bunch of episodes really in the middle where it's nothing.

326
00:19:56,415 --> 00:20:03,823
Scott: but go to a new town You know a new bad guy, of course, then you get to dynamite Neon, that's.

327
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:06,130
Scott: but I mean that's really really into dynamite.

328
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,999
Scott: Yeah, that's really just a two-parter with a bad guy.

329
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:10,929
Rym: Yeah, but he was the great bad guy.

330
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:12,135
Scott: I mean, they're all great bad guys.

331
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:14,425
Scott: That's the thing like the sniper You know, every bad guy is great.

332
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:20,370
Scott: It's just mostly go to town bad guy go to town bad guy slowly Reveal something's going on.

333
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:27,599
Rym: We'll see though because I have watching it again I'm remembering that you that you don't know, you know what the show is until near the end.

334
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:31,094
Scott: Yeah, so and I've never rewatched episodes episode 17, I believe.

335
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:37,160
Rym: Yeah Where we stopped the show, we're like, did you download the wrong fan sub exactly?

336
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,214
Scott: That's I believe that is the episode where it actually you know turns around.

337
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:44,949
Scott: but so like but like, you know episode 13 is actually he.

338
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:50,051
Rym: when is when he goes crazy, but like yeah with That's that's the one word, you know people actually die.

339
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:51,278
Scott: It's like the demon episode.

340
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,137
Scott: Yeah Diablo, yeah.

341
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,613
Scott: So we'll see.

342
00:20:55,381 --> 00:21:00,920
Rym: I mean the other thing is I've just gotten to the point where I remember the show getting way dark and way awesome.

343
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:05,190
Rym: So it might still be an a-minus but it might be b-plus.

344
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:05,652
Rym: I don't know.

345
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:08,218
Rym: We'll see in anime news.

346
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:15,560
Rym: very briefly Summer Wars is one of the one of my favorite anime movies just because it was great King Kong cosmon.

347
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,577
Rym: So it's up for the Oscar, I mean pon you didn't win the Oscar last year, but it was.

348
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:20,160
Rym: it was not.

349
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,405
Scott: There's no way it's winning.

350
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:22,629
Scott: So not a chance.

351
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,637
Scott: Well if it wins I will bet money.

352
00:21:24,657 --> 00:21:25,240
Scott: It will not win.

353
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,712
Rym: It's only up against among other movies how to train your dragon.

354
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:34,029
Rym: despicable me the owl movies Toy Story 3 Story 3 already won.

355
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:38,511
Scott: probably it's a horror And so I haven't even seen it.

356
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:44,740
Scott: but I can guarantee I'm not even a movie person You know, he's not as not nearly as much as many other people in the world.

357
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:48,160
Scott: It's Toy Story 3 is a lock for that category.

358
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,004
Scott: There's no story.

359
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:51,740
Scott: No way the stupid owls are winning ever know what the owls are in there?

360
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,340
Rym: Right if Toy Story 3 was not in the running I would guess that how to train your dragon would win.

361
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,089
Scott: Yeah, but I mean while summer wars is great.

362
00:21:59,129 --> 00:22:04,005
Scott: There's no way it's gonna beat those Even though it's pretty.

363
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:08,720
Scott: I mean, it's probably actually, you know, like Toy Story 3 is obviously the winner.

364
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:14,169
Scott: I mean summer wars is right up under it But it is no way it can get up to that.

365
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:14,650
Scott: next level.

366
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,020
Rym: summer wars has seven of those little leaf things on the poster.

367
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:19,003
Scott: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

368
00:22:19,023 --> 00:22:21,972
Scott: It deserves even more but it's not Toy Story 3.

369
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:23,457
Scott: There's no way now it can't win.

370
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:24,360
Scott: There's no chance.

371
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,449
Scott: That's like it's like oh man who's going to?

372
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,115
Rym: who's gonna win the ae86 or the ae85?

373
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,773
Scott: No, it's more like all right Rym, you know, who are you?

374
00:22:33,793 --> 00:22:35,220
Scott: Who are you putting in the ring?

375
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,867
Scott: It's like I'm putting in Mike Tyson.

376
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:37,469
Scott: Oh shit.

377
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,634
Scott: There's no way he's gonna lose.

378
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:41,144
Rym: Yes, Joe too bad I got Muhammad Ali.

379
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:48,168
Scott: Oh, well, then so so Toy Story 3 is Muhammad Ali Summer Wars is Mike Tyson.

380
00:22:48,249 --> 00:22:50,380
Rym: So is Legend of the Guardian is glass Joe.

381
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:54,708
Scott: Yeah, the owls.

382
00:22:54,768 --> 00:22:56,354
Scott: the owls is not even glass Joe.

383
00:22:56,414 --> 00:23:04,384
Scott: the owls is the guy from super punch-out Gabby J. Yay All right.

384
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:09,923
Scott: Oh Interesting thing right?

385
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:13,312
Scott: Apparently there is a French Japanese thing going on.

386
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:13,954
Scott: It's pay.

387
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:25,920
Scott: It's some anime paid for by France's l'institut national de prevention de education, which is the National Institute That was the best French accent I ever heard preventative and health education.

388
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,220
Scott: And basically they wanted to make a 10-minute don't smoke kids anime.

389
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:33,275
Scott: So they got studio 4c to do it all high quality.

390
00:23:33,335 --> 00:23:35,586
Scott: Whoa And it's gonna be pretty awesome.

391
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:39,261
Scott: I imagine I think you can actually watch it on the Internet's.

392
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:47,872
Scott: yeah the complete short titled the attraction is now available at a website and it's got dubbed into Japanese or French and Then you get an English subtitles.

393
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:49,658
Scott: Ooh So there you go.

394
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:54,900
Rym: It saddens me that I think I still understand French more than I understand Japanese.

395
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,630
Scott: What's interesting about this right is is two things.

396
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:05,080
Scott: number one, right is like, okay They've got you know, usually stuff that's like don't smoke kids or don't do drugs.

397
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:11,526
Scott: It's like low production value like remember all those raps from the 90s That'd be like, you know, don't do?

398
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:15,980
Scott: they were the lowest when I was second grade value.

399
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:29,694
Rym: I discovered that there was a place in the school library where you could check out instead of a book a movie Whoa, and I was like, oh man, and I saw this one called fast forward future Whoa, and I was like, this is gonna be awesome.

400
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:36,720
Rym: It was Possibly the most pathetic anti-drug hour-long movie I've ever witnessed.

401
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:43,959
Scott: Yes, I mean so but imagine if say they paid like Steven Spielberg to make an anti-drug movie, right?

402
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:44,924
Scott: That would be like.

403
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,293
Scott: no one does that everyone.

404
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:49,195
Scott: I feel like there's a joke I could make or they got actual like in the 70s.

405
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,476
Rym: I feel like I could have said he did it was called and said the name of some movie.

406
00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:54,260
Rym: that would have been what it.

407
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:56,579
Scott: What if they actually made like Star Wars?

408
00:24:57,424 --> 00:25:02,070
Scott: Like like as good as episode four or five six anti-drug movie.

409
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:08,158
Rym: well in Episode one he did say you shouldn't smoke because they were what cancer sticks or something.

410
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:08,660
Scott: I don't know.

411
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,752
Scott: Yeah, that was episode one not four or five six.

412
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:14,803
Rym: Well, I guess it wasn't Star Wars Here.

413
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:23,672
Scott: they basically got some of the best animes there are right, you know studio 4c To work on a 10-minute long don't smoke thing.

414
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:26,060
Scott: So that that in alone is pretty awesome, right?

415
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:32,139
Scott: The second thing that I find this really interesting is like smoking is actually as big a problem as it is here in.

416
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,680
Scott: Oh in France in Japan in Japan, it's the worst everybody's and you can just smoke everywhere.

417
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:39,126
Scott: You can smoke in your house.

418
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,832
Scott: You can smoke in the restaurant.

419
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,675
Scott: Yes.

420
00:25:41,696 --> 00:25:42,740
Scott: It makes me not want to go there.

421
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,032
Rym: Yeah, even DC apparently, you know where we were at the rally, right?

422
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:49,000
Rym: We went to a restaurant and well We thought it was a restaurant.

423
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,207
Rym: They're like smoking or not and we're like what?

424
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:55,620
Rym: because apparently if it's also a bar they can have a smoking section.

425
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:58,931
Rym: So we left and we found another restaurant that didn't have that.

426
00:25:59,553 --> 00:26:00,838
Rym: Yeah, we found a restaurant.

427
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:01,460
Rym: There wasn't a bar.

428
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:06,916
Scott: All right, but it's weird in New York City, like almost every restaurant you go to has a bar in it.

429
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:12,040
Scott: Yeah anyway So what I you know, I thought was really interesting about this is right.

430
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,540
Scott: I was like, I'm wondering how many cuz it takes a lot of people to animate something, right?

431
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,400
Rym: So I'm like how many of those people were smoking?

432
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:23,180
Scott: How many of these guys a studio 4c who worked on this animation smoke?

433
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:28,136
Scott: Right and how ironic is that these non-smoking people these smokers made this non-smoke.

434
00:26:28,197 --> 00:26:29,180
Rym: it would not be ironic.

435
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,360
Scott: I mean, I don't know one of them quit smoking because they made this.

436
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,260
Scott: I don't know if any of them do or don't you know, I mean they could all be non-smokers.

437
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,013
Scott: It's entirely possible, but the odds are in these countries where smoking is just so prevalent.

438
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:41,956
Rym: Of course.

439
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:43,139
Rym: I did read a study.

440
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:45,551
Rym: I read the abstract of the study.

441
00:26:45,611 --> 00:26:52,393
Rym: It was a couple months ago talking about how American cigarettes are actually Particularly more dangerous than cigarettes the entire rest of the world.

442
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,000
Rym: Yeah because of the way they're made.

443
00:26:54,521 --> 00:27:06,434
Scott: Well, I think I think part actually part of the reason they make them that way right is a because burn more addictive cheaper more And the regulation isn't there but also because they're restricted.

444
00:27:06,514 --> 00:27:09,100
Scott: So I there are a lot less restricted in other places, right?

445
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,940
Scott: It's not like 18 plus, right?

446
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,500
Scott: So for if they could just sell them to kids or to younger people as they can and of many other places.

447
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:20,800
Scott: Right, then they wouldn't need to make a more addictive because they get you early.

448
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,270
Scott: So you're already addicted to just the regular amount of nicotine.

449
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:27,417
Scott: but because because they're gonna get you so late They got to up the ante to.

450
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:31,620
Rym: you know Japan also has the workaholic culture that I think drives the smoking pretty heavily.

451
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,755
Scott: Well, it's also Francis France because they let people smoke anywhere, right?

452
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:37,220
Scott: You're just exposed to it all the time.

453
00:27:37,382 --> 00:27:38,240
Scott: So it's a lot of you, right?

454
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:45,245
Rym: So yeah, that's a catch-22 because if you're exposed to it everywhere, then no individual person is gonna be like, yeah Yeah, I mean it's just.

455
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:48,819
Scott: it's a whole problem and you know, we should just ban it outright.

456
00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:50,196
Scott: You should only be allowed to smoke.

457
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:55,740
Scott: I mean Smoke in your house if no one's around who doesn't consent.

458
00:27:55,941 --> 00:28:00,499
Scott: I'm fine with the way New York's doing it because the new laws I want to get it out of the sidewalk and out of the park.

459
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:11,956
Rym: Ah, so the new laws that are basically crazily popular that are probably gonna pass also in addition to all the existing bands in New York City will ban smoking in boardwalks parks and any public plaza sidewalk.

460
00:28:12,156 --> 00:28:13,280
Scott: It's not banning the sidewalk.

461
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,300
Scott: No, it is banned within 100 feet of any door and now I should be on the sidewalk all sidewalks period.

462
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:33,146
Rym: Anyway, anyway So things of the day Emily showed me this and it was pretty badass.

463
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,490
Rym: You can watch the whole thing on YouTube.

464
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:40,249
Rym: This is a 2007 animated short by a Russian animation studio.

Rym: It's like ten minutes long.

470
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:08,995
Rym: It's beautiful and while depressing it is as depressing as you could expect a Russian animation about dogs To be.

471
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:10,263
Scott: does it have pockner styling?

472
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:13,481

00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,843
Rym: So you're thinking the day is something that everyone will want and no one will be able to get.

Scott: hopefully this person will make another Bad.

532
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:47,304

Scott: I don't know what the actual item price was.

544
00:32:34,182 --> 00:32:35,409

554
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,139
Scott: They're just one by one inch squares.

555
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,850
Scott: You already have the sprites in the game.

556
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,090
Scott: You just copy and paste them right out of there and you're good to go.

557
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:14,689
Scott: But this guy did it for you and he seems to be you know skilled at it.

558
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:17,680
Scott: He knows whatever you need to know to get magnets printed properly.

559

Scott: Also, it's Thanksgiving.

574
00:34:01,598 --> 00:34:11,330
Scott: if you would like to make me a geeky cornucopia I will again ask you kindly do we have the fan art section up on the side to show off the old cornucopia?

575
00:34:11,431 --> 00:34:12,054
Scott: Oh, no, right.

576
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:12,918
Scott: I'll make it real quick.

577
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,790
Rym: Yeah, you have some good cornucopias.

578
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:20,110
Scott: They were actually really only two good cornucopias and the only really good one is the one with booze coming out of it.

579
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:24,127
Rym: Oh way to really make the person who made the other cornucopia feel bad.

580
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,750
Scott: Come on You just look at him and it's sort of obvious.

581
00:34:27,072 --> 00:34:29,161
Scott: Yeah, I don't remember what it was.

582
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:30,810
Scott: I don't remember the other one over the boo one.

583
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:35,380
Scott: Anyway, we need better and more cornucopias of geekiness.

584
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,342
Scott: like pretend it's Photoshop Friday and it's like Photoshop this cornucopia and Add geekiness to it.

585
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:45,632
Rym: or dicks geeky dicks Please don't.

586
00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:49,850
Rym: I don't think we ever did a show on Looney Tunes.

587
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,672
Scott: I'm free.

588
00:34:51,694 --> 00:34:55,350
Scott: We might have discussed them as part of some show way back.

589
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:58,330
Rym: We were like cartoons of our youth, but that was all he-man thunder.

590
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,610
Scott: I think we actually did mention Looney Tunes in it.

591
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:05,046
Scott: But why the hell not devote a whole show to something so important that I and the thing?

592
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:06,190
Scott: other reason is not only is it?

593
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,816
Scott: Very important and very awesome.

594
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:10,970
Scott: I think it has actually been sort of neglected and forgotten.

595
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:16,750
Rym: Well, I was looking around on YouTube and many of the classics were not easily available for free just online.

596
00:35:17,126 --> 00:35:18,883
Scott: No You gotta buy them on DVD or just a lot of money.

597
00:35:19,024 --> 00:35:26,582
Rym: and I was poking around Netflix and those and more importantly all the old Disney Equivalents like the Donald Duck cartoons and everything also really only available on DVD.

598
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:28,810
Rym: Yeah, and none of them are in the Netflix streaming.

599
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:41,290
Scott: Yeah, and I think the worst thing about it though Is that I mean when we were kids you would come home and you would watch cartoons Or you watch cartoons on Saturday morning and the thing was there would all the cartoons that you watched would change over time.

600
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:50,156
Scott: Right, you know, it would be Transformers and Voltron But then it would be Thundercats and then that Thundercats would go away and then you'd have pup name Scooby Doo And they'd keep cycling in and out.

601
00:35:50,558 --> 00:35:58,386
Scott: but from the time that I was very young like three To the time that you know, pretty much my entire childhood life.

602
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:06,695
Scott: I was 18 Looney Tunes always had a time slot whether it was Cartoon Network or Nickelodeon or ABC Saturday Morning or something.

603
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:16,250
Scott: there was cartoon slots and Looney Tunes always had a spot in there Somewhere, you know pretty much after that It was Rocky and Bullwinkle always had a slot somewhere most of the time.

604
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:16,491
Rym: I think.

605
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:19,320
Scott: more important Looney Tunes always had a slot all the time.

606
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:29,432
Rym: when I think back to watching Looney Tunes versus other cartoons I would never really want to watch an episode of like a pup named Scooby Doo more than once Exactly.

607
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:33,369
Rym: Maybe I'd get stuck watching it twice because it was on and there was nothing else to do.

608
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:36,750
Rym: But I pretty much never got sick of the good Looney Tunes.

609
00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:37,797
Scott: Yeah, I mean that you could.

610
00:36:37,877 --> 00:36:39,690
Scott: it was refused reruns all the time, right?

611
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,719
Scott: Cuz after a couple years if you're a kid you would seen them all.

612
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:50,195
Scott: I mean, I've seen everything from Bosco The way through.

613
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:54,310
Scott: I don't think you could find a Looney Tune all the way up to like Space Jam, right?

614
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:00,072
Scott: So I don't think you could find something unless it was newer than Space Jam or older than Bosco that I have not seen Right.

615
00:37:00,172 --> 00:37:00,814
Rym: Well, I mean it depends.

616
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:10,614
Rym: if we're just talking Looney Tunes merit melodies versus if you zoom out to count like the Max Fleischer stuff Tom and Jerry Doesn't count.

617
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:13,685
Scott: the thing is those are all in the same time slots.

618
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:15,130
Scott: we saw all those as well.

619
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,177
Scott: All right, thanks Avery.

620
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:17,869
Scott: We saw all of it, right?

621
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,127
Scott: You know takes Avery had it.

622
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:19,952
Scott: There was a text.

623
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:24,770
Scott: Avery hour on fucking Cartoon Network for the longest time Scott because I know the answer to this.

624
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,981
Rym: I think everyone who knows us knows the answer to this.

625
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:28,770
Rym: It's your favorite Looney Tunes episode.

626
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:34,227
Scott: Oh, you're you're I don't know how I know it, but I know you don't even know.

627
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:35,070
Scott: you don't even know it.

628
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:37,358
Rym: No, because I know you I was gonna quote it.

629
00:37:37,418 --> 00:37:38,803
Rym: I was I was modifying it.

630
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:43,634
Scott: Oh, he's hiding in the store Just the line.

631
00:37:43,654 --> 00:37:46,523
Rym: when the dude comes on this stove he just coming.

632
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:48,469
Rym: he'd be like, I know he's done it.

633
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,095
Scott: That wasn't the same episode.

634
00:37:52,135 --> 00:38:01,070
Scott: nobody was the same character wasn't carries that the thing is the episode with the stove is the superior Episode to the one with the the closet right which is that I don't know how he's done at one.

635
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:02,937
Rym: I actually prefer that one.

636
00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:07,290
Scott: No, the the stove one is is the best one by far anyway.

637
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:13,446
Scott: So yeah, these things were on TV no matter what every kid knew him.

638
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:14,530
Scott: every kid saw him, right?

639
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,038
Scott: It was sort of like for me.

640
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:18,190
Scott: It was a lot like Batman the animated series, right?

641
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,369
Scott: It's like they were sir.

642
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,092
Scott: It was weird.

643
00:38:20,192 --> 00:38:21,055
Scott: my whole like.

644
00:38:21,095 --> 00:38:24,365
Scott: there were things that I would be really enthusiastic about right like it back.

645
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:25,007
Scott: Oh fuck.

646
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:37,550
Scott: Yes Thundercats Yeah, but it was only on for a short period and meanwhile there were things which were just always there staples Right, and I never got sick of them, but I also never looked forward to them.

647
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:43,674
Rym: I see it's like shit bugs bunnies coming on but bugs money would be on and it would be awesome always Yeah, and sort of like.

648
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:45,079
Scott: it's same thing with food, right?

649
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:48,330
Scott: It's like, you know bread is awesome, right?

650
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,454
Scott: But you have bread every day.

651
00:38:49,515 --> 00:38:51,603
Scott: So it's like bread and steak.

652
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:55,379
Scott: you have like once a week once a month Maybe right not it's rare but steak.

653
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,226
Scott: You're like, oh it better be rare, right?

654
00:38:57,246 --> 00:39:00,057
Scott: But you're like, oh fuck Yeah steak, right, but you never.

655
00:39:00,077 --> 00:39:07,366
Scott: yeah, it's not until we're adults and we're wiser and we look back and we go Oh, yeah, right, you know, it's like when you have bread every day.

656
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:08,169
Scott: It's just like bread.

657
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:10,399
Scott: Looney Tunes is like that.

658
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:11,685
Scott: It was just like Looney Tunes.

659
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,675
Rym: part of it with Looney Tunes Is that the?

660
00:39:14,077 --> 00:39:16,530
Rym: I mean, especially you know, the original Looney Tunes and Mary Malick.

661
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:17,332
Rym: You know They were like.

662
00:39:17,693 --> 00:39:21,709
Rym: quality was all over the place in those kinds of cartoons later on.

663
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:25,050
Rym: Remember those weird like late 80s Tom and Jerry?

664
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,280
Scott: Well, Tom and Jerry isn't Looney Tunes either.

665
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,095
Rym: No it isn't, but I said those like that whole Cartoons like that.

666
00:39:31,657 --> 00:39:34,510
Rym: They got into weird eras, but Looney Tunes is pretty consistent and the early.

667
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:42,410
Scott: There are some Looney Tunes that are not as good But you know most and some of them repeat the same jokes and you would totally see they repeated the same joke, right?

668
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,949
Scott: Yeah, but you know the good ones were beyond good, you know.

669
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:52,716
Rym: But it was mostly that the production values were way high because those things are Ancients.

670
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:54,350
Rym: they were made for theaters.

671
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:57,021
Scott: That was that's the one thing that like get.

672
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,073
Scott: that was the reason that they were able to be on TV right for all.

673
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:09,606
Scott: that time is because if you looked and it always confused the hell out of me because I was like Weren't these things made it like the 40s or even older than that and these are really old right.

674
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:12,990
Scott: but that you look at them They look way better than any cartoon.

675
00:40:13,492 --> 00:40:18,554
Scott: Then you look at like Scooby-doo from the 60s or 70s and you're like Why is this Scooby-doo?

676
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:23,410
Scott: look like shit and Don this Donald Duck cartoon from a hundred years ago looks amazing, right?

677
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,169
Scott: Because these things are made for movie theaters.

678
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:26,933
Scott: I these are.

679
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:36,230
Scott: this is film right and then they were just put on TV later, you know Some of them were made for TV later years, you know, but well, they're all great.

680
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:41,550
Rym: There are those weird really like they would make movie compilations of cartoons.

681
00:40:42,092 --> 00:40:48,195
Rym: There were all kinds of different formats but Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales ones Yeah, but awful.

682
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:56,110
Scott: a good number of them were actually, you know made for theaters And they ran in front of actual movies.

683
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:02,722
Scott: You would go to the theater to see an actual movie and before the actual movie started you would see a Looney Tune And then the movie would start right.

684
00:41:02,742 --> 00:41:11,510
Scott: and nowadays They only really do that if you go to see something like Space Jam, right where there's a loop a Looney Tunes stick going on.

685
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:21,829
Scott: And actually if I made movies I kind of want to make movies for Warner Brothers just so I could Get them to make a Looney Tune in front of every movie I make no matter what movie.

686
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:31,487
Scott: it is Not that I'm ever gonna make a movie But I really think they need to bring that back where every movie you watch as a serial before it or something before it You know, that's we got to bring that back in a big way.

687
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:31,910
Scott: It's awesome.

688
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:45,760
Scott: So, yeah Looney Tunes is wicked awesome and it's sad that is not really like from what I don't watch TV obviously But I'm pretty sure they're not really on TV anymore Like you have to watch like the boomerang channel to see them.

689
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,070
Scott: I mean even then I don't know how much they're on there.

690
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,794
Rym: Here's my question.

691
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:51,470
Rym: Is that really true or do we just not watch TV?

692
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,392
Scott: I'm pretty.

693
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:58,310
Scott: I'm pretty sure that they're not on TV like every single day like they were when we were kids.

694
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:02,284
Rym: You know it well, some of them are not on TV because they're little.

695
00:42:02,304 --> 00:42:04,070
Scott: that was also upsetting.

696
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,219
Scott: It's like at some point during our childhoods.

697
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:08,308
Scott: They took off like speedy Gonzales disappeared.

698
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:13,022
Rym: granted I watched some speedy Gonzales again and and Bosco disappeared pretty racist.

699
00:42:13,704 --> 00:42:17,037
Scott: Yeah, but it you know, I mean, it's not bad It's just you know, right?

700
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:24,950
Rym: Well, it's it's bad for what it is But at the same time you don't ban the old works just because the world sucked back then.

701
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,180
Rym: I know right just present them with context.

702
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,330
Scott: It's like Nazi Disney, right?

703
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:32,842
Scott: You know why you banning that shit or song of the south?

704
00:42:33,304 --> 00:42:33,946
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

705
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:35,110
Scott: That's the best example.

706
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,858
Rym: That is a really racist movie.

707
00:42:36,919 --> 00:42:38,265
Scott: song of the south is awesome though.

708
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:42,790
Rym: It is a good movie All right, at least I. I have not seen it since I was a very young child.

709
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:47,828
Scott: Yeah I think you have to take the same approach that you take with the Tezuka's and all that kind of stuff.

710
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:54,050
Scott: even Tintin right a lot, you know gives me Tezuka wasn't racist, but some of his depictions were racist depictions.

711
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:05,450
Scott: But that's just was the style of the times and they put a note in front of all the his manga that have that You know some bad stylings in it Like look as it goes the exact opposite of racist, but that was the style of the time.

712
00:43:05,872 --> 00:43:09,830
Scott: We're not gonna edit it, you know, but you know, why would should we hide history?

713
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:20,870
Scott: We in fact, that would be a disservice, you know We need to look at the racism of the past and that is how we know not to make that mistake again If we just wipe it off the head of history, that's even worse.

714
00:43:21,472 --> 00:43:26,150
Scott: Right then, you know making it prominent like look at the horrible racism of the past.

715
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,059
Scott: You need to remember that the world was that way.

716
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:29,265
Scott: so we don't go back to that way.

717
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:30,310
Scott: if we just erase it.

718
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:32,730
Scott: It's like that that's that's not a good idea.

719
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:37,290
Scott: And the thing is even in cases like Tintin right where you know.

720
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:43,990
Scott: There's actually probably a reason to believe least some reasons to believe that you know her gay was actually kind of racist.

721
00:43:44,753 --> 00:43:48,848
Scott: You know unlike Tezuka, you still shouldn't be censoring it, you know.

722
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:54,190
Scott: Anyway, so I think that you should still have Speedy Gonzalez, even though he is racist.

723
00:43:54,551 --> 00:44:00,590
Rym: Actually, I think one of my favorite ones overall as an adult and looking back is the kill the web killed.

724
00:44:01,312 --> 00:44:02,499
Scott: Yeah, I mean all day.

725
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:13,024
Scott: there were certain ones that were just you know Like the the ones that you could tell they put like the extra double effort into right the ones that stood out Right, you know like the opera one.

726
00:44:13,064 --> 00:44:18,829
Scott: I forget the name of it You know cuz it's got like and you could tell they were even better animated since some of the other ones, right?

727
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:27,653
Scott: Well, how about the one with with Porky and Daffy in the hotel and the hotel guy who wants to Is Right or the bad?

728
00:44:28,175 --> 00:44:32,406
Rym: as a kid that one kind of scared me because it was weird and like.

729
00:44:32,426 --> 00:44:38,628
Rym: I was unnerved because a Lot of the things you wouldn't let him leave the hotel until they pay and a lot of the things that happen like.

730
00:44:38,668 --> 00:44:51,821
Rym: it's interesting watching old cartoons like that or like the ones that are set on farms where they kind of assume a lot of knowledge in the viewers about farm life or About the way the world worked back then.

731
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:53,690
Rym: that just doesn't apply at all anymore.

732
00:44:53,811 --> 00:44:54,513
Scott: I mean some.

733
00:44:54,574 --> 00:44:58,370
Rym: it's like it's weird because on the one hand that hotel manager scared the crap out of me when I was.

734
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:03,066
Scott: Yeah, some of the Looney Tunes stand up so well because they are timeless, right?

735
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:07,850
Scott: But But some of them actually are not timeless.

736
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:17,465
Scott: Right, like a lot of them will make jokes about famous people from a zillion years ago the same time I get the jokes, but a lot of people don't at the same time.

737
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:18,630
Rym: Look at a lot of those old cartoons.

738
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:27,462
Rym: It wasn't until Brett like in the last several years that I actually learned who Peter Laurie was But I recognized Peter Laurie through most of my life because he was.

739
00:45:27,843 --> 00:45:30,150
Rym: it was that face and that voice in the cartoons.

740
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,333
Scott: Yeah, but I mean there were.

741
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:37,814
Rym: I mean how many kids even when we were kids knew who Groucho Marx was and yet they found Bugs Bunny hilarious.

742
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:41,630
Scott: Yeah, there are thousands of graduate marks references in there like all the time.

743
00:45:41,771 --> 00:45:47,319
Rym: Right also know how Bugs Bunny was kind of Metrosexual little weird and a jerk.

744
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,270
Scott: Yeah cross-dresser, you know, but the thing is Bugs Bunny.

745
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:54,730
Scott: I don't know how he became like the pride like the primary guy, right?

746
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:57,550
Scott: It's like you look at Disney and Mickey Mouse is the number one guy.

747
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:03,792
Scott: But you know how he became the number one guy is because he was the first guy not because they used him a lot or Anything like that.

748
00:46:03,812 --> 00:46:05,358
Scott: It's cuz he was the first guy right.

749
00:46:05,378 --> 00:46:08,990
Scott: they say, you know, I mean you look at like Marvel Comics, right?

750
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,615
Scott: Why is spider-man the guy?

751
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:14,530
Scott: it's actually Fantastic Four was the first guys, right?

752
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:20,090
Scott: Spider-man was after that but it was you know, spider-man was the one that was the huge hit, right?

753
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,094
Scott: But it's like was big.

754
00:46:21,155 --> 00:46:22,463
Scott: was Bugs Bunny the first?

755
00:46:22,644 --> 00:46:23,710
Rym: yeah, not really.

756
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,474
Scott: No, there was.

757
00:46:24,514 --> 00:46:25,137
Scott: there were there were.

758
00:46:25,177 --> 00:46:27,710
Scott: they were making cartoons before they came out there making cartoons.

759
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:29,529
Rym: But I thought we were just talking about Looney Tunes.

760
00:46:30,011 --> 00:46:31,095
Scott: Yeah, there were cart there were not.

761
00:46:31,115 --> 00:46:35,450
Scott: there were Looney Tunes with other non Bugs Bunny characters before Bosco.

762
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,799
Scott: Yeah, even though you know, there are other ones right?

763
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:38,622
Scott: He was not the first.

764
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,590
Scott: very first one was not Bugs Bunny, right?

765
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,354
Scott: I'm pretty sure that.

766
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:45,715
Scott: and on top of that was Bugs Bunny really the big hit I think.

767
00:46:45,775 --> 00:46:47,485
Scott: so cuz I mean if he was the hit.

768
00:46:47,545 --> 00:46:50,036
Scott: I'm like wow, you know Cuz he was the hit with another generation right?

769
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,370
Scott: not our generation cuz I. Bugs Bunny was not my favorite guy.

770
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:54,638
Rym: Who's your favorite guy?

771
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,330
Scott: There was Daffy Duck my favorite guy.

772
00:46:56,591 --> 00:46:57,876
Rym: I really liked Daffy Duck cuz.

773
00:46:57,896 --> 00:47:03,979
Rym: he was such a just a goddamn asshole But he wasn't funny about it likes Bugs Bunny.

774
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:06,710
Rym: He was just a jerk, but he was also crazy.

775
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:09,218
Scott: Well, I mean the thing was right is like.

776
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:12,890
Rym: it's kind of like an early rendition of Lewis Black in duck form.

777
00:47:13,774 --> 00:47:23,383
Scott: I don't know in terms of like, you know the coolness of the characters Right, like Marvin the Martian is like a cool character like, you know design and such.

778
00:47:23,744 --> 00:47:30,666
Scott: but in terms of like the cartoon Like if you took all of the cartoons involve it, you know and averaged them together.

779
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:31,890
Scott: I like the Roadrunner ones.

780
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:32,895
Scott: It was always.

781
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:35,248
Scott: it was like above average every time.

782
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:37,222
Scott: you know Some of the other ones like a porky pig.

783
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:37,685
Scott: It could be up.

784
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:38,330
Scott: It could be down.

785
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,950
Scott: Right, some of them were better than others, but any Roadrunner is like solid, you know.

786
00:47:43,352 --> 00:47:45,784
Rym: There were later Roadrunners that were actually pretty crappy.

787
00:47:45,844 --> 00:47:46,266
Scott: What do you mean?

788
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:46,487
Scott: Like Lee?

789
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:47,070
Scott: What do you mean?

790
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,577
Scott: They're all the same joke every time.

791
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:50,747
Rym: Yeah, and then they started moving like when they started.

792
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,494
Rym: they could like the Wile E. Coyote would talk.

793
00:47:53,734 --> 00:48:01,158
Rym: that was only one episode retalked and I remember I never found the ones between Wile E. Coyote and the Sheepdog to be that funny.

794
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:03,230
Scott: No, the Sheepdog one were not good.

795
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,496
Scott: I'm only talking about the Roadrunner one.

796
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:06,085
Rym: Okay, so just the Roadrunner.

797
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:06,507
Rym: Yeah.

798
00:48:06,547 --> 00:48:07,090
Rym: Yeah, then we're good.

799
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:12,067
Rym: Yeah, I actually have this like five foot tall stuffed Wile E. Coyote from like the 50s.

800
00:48:12,107 --> 00:48:12,810
Rym: That was my dad's.

801
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:13,331
Scott: Oh really?

802
00:48:13,351 --> 00:48:14,957
Scott: Yeah, and the what, you know, which I?

803
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:16,482
Scott: so which one did you like?

804
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:21,110
Scott: you really did not like and do not want Did not like and did not want.

805
00:48:21,552 --> 00:48:29,759
Rym: There were the ones that were on TV all the time that as much as I liked them I just didn't want to watch them again Which usually was the Wile E. Coyote Roadrunner ones.

806
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:30,281
Rym: Really?

807
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:37,590
Rym: Like they were just always beyond and I'd seen like I'd seen The one where Bugs Bunny just tortures that opera singer like a hundred times.

808
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:41,684
Rym: It was great, but I'd seen the Roadrunner ones like a million times.

809
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:45,410
Scott: The ones that I don't like are the What's the stupid rooster's name?

810
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:46,531
Rym: Really?

811
00:48:46,612 --> 00:48:47,355
Rym: Foghorn Leghorn?

812
00:48:47,395 --> 00:48:48,680
Scott: Yeah, I don't like Foghorn Leghorn.

813
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,383
Scott: I love him.

814
00:48:49,423 --> 00:48:50,126
Scott: Those are great.

815
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:51,110
Rym: And the Chickenhawk?

816
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,278
Scott: I mean some of the Foghorn Leghorn ones.

817
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:54,181
Rym: Now the thing is the thing.

818
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,306
Rym: and now see him.

819
00:48:55,386 --> 00:48:56,310
Rym: Now see him.

820
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:58,970
Scott: The ones where he tortures the dog, right?

821
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:02,686
Scott: It was like the joke where he like would trick the dog into bumping into the fence.

822
00:49:02,847 --> 00:49:03,410
Scott: That was good.

823
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:07,583
Scott: But like I when he was talking it's just like oh god, shut up.

824
00:49:08,065 --> 00:49:08,787
Scott: I can't stand him.

825
00:49:08,807 --> 00:49:09,710
Scott: No, he's no good.

826
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:10,492
Rym: It was a good joke.

827
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:11,213
Rym: It was a good shtick.

828
00:49:11,634 --> 00:49:16,999
Scott: No, and actually some of the ones that I did like were the Yosemite Sam on the boat with the.

829
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,814
Scott: oh, man, they made the powder room joke No, I think.

830
00:49:19,854 --> 00:49:22,370
Scott: and then also the foreign legion joke.

831
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:32,970
Rym: I think most people have not seen those as they were originally made Because a lot of those were added into those shitty compilation movies like Donald Duck and Speedy Gonzalez.

832
00:49:33,075 --> 00:49:44,114
Scott: Yeah It was actually weird right because like to actually see the Yosemite Sam on the boat or Yosemite Sam in the foreign Legion the only place I or like even some of the Tasmanian devil ones right.

833
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:50,170
Scott: the only time I ever saw those was on the ABC Saturday morning, you know, like those ones, right?

834
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:51,897
Scott: I never saw those on Nickelodeon.

835
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:53,745
Scott: They might have been on there at some point, but I never saw.

836
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:56,879
Scott: I don't remember seeing them Nickelodeon or on Cartoon Network.

837
00:49:56,899 --> 00:49:58,550
Scott: I only saw them on ABC Saturday morning.

838
00:49:59,153 --> 00:50:09,167
Scott: So it's like they were special like higher production cost ones Or something like that or newer or I don't know why they were only on that channel But at least in my day they were only on that channel.

839
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:14,603
Scott: Yeah, can you can you think of any others that we may have neglected?

840
00:50:14,623 --> 00:50:16,350
Rym: I mean I can think of all a million.

841
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:18,170
Rym: I think it's more I don't know.

842
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:27,791
Rym: I feel I really have this urge to watch not just Looney Tunes but like the old Disney like Donald Duck's and Chip and Dale All that kind of old and Seen.

843
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:31,100
Scott: well, I think you know, they're just first overall Donald Duck wins a car.

844
00:50:31,722 --> 00:50:33,506
Scott: They're just not as good as Looney Tunes.

845
00:50:33,526 --> 00:50:35,692
Rym: I Disagree.

846
00:50:35,712 --> 00:50:39,905
Rym: Donald Duck once made Huey Dewey and Louie's smoked cigars until they almost died.

847
00:50:39,925 --> 00:50:40,687
Rym: Yeah.

848
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:41,750
Rym: Yeah, it was hilarious.

849
00:50:42,032 --> 00:50:44,324
Scott: it's not as it's not as you know, they're not as good.

850
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:46,993
Scott: first of all, right and You know.

851
00:50:47,013 --> 00:50:50,850
Scott: the the other thing with them is that you know, they weren't they didn't have the same.

852
00:50:51,473 --> 00:50:56,994
Scott: You know, the production values were not quite as high and They were also.

853
00:50:57,014 --> 00:51:00,930
Scott: a lot of them were made for like, you know to buy on home video like the goofy sports.

854
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,437
Scott: It's like buy this on VHS.

855
00:51:02,678 --> 00:51:04,065
Rym: It's like the goofy sports.

856
00:51:04,085 --> 00:51:08,103
Scott: However, we're brilliant Yeah, and they're alright, but it's like nobody bought those on VHS.

857
00:51:08,184 --> 00:51:09,369
Scott: I did you only you.

858
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,542
Rym: Yeah, we had them all in those huge like old-school clay.

859
00:51:13,562 --> 00:51:20,162
Scott: Yeah, those big plastic clamshell things Nobody, you know, so they had a lot less reach than the.

860
00:51:20,182 --> 00:51:22,750
Scott: the Looney Tunes are just on all the time.

861
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:23,172
Scott: You know.

862
00:51:23,312 --> 00:51:28,849
Scott: and the Looney Tunes really the thing about it having something that's good That's on all the time.

863
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:33,710
Scott: They just everyone watches without sort of realizing that they're a fan of it because it's not their focus.

864
00:51:34,312 --> 00:51:39,410
Scott: I think really helps to bring people together, you know more so than an individual thing.

865
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:41,470
Rym: That's very popular among pop culture people.

866
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:47,750
Rym: I mean American Idol is stupidly popular, but if you don't care about stupid things, you're not connected to that at all.

867
00:51:48,392 --> 00:51:54,110
Scott: Yeah, but having something that just everyone watches that's below the radar, but it's just you know pervasive, right?

868
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,500
Scott: It's like, you know very for a long time.

869
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,770
Rym: The Simpsons was like that exactly, right?

870
00:51:59,051 --> 00:52:03,409
Scott: It's like, you know that it brings people together much better than you know.

871
00:52:04,452 --> 00:52:07,790
Scott: Anything that's stupidly popular is going to be divisive actually, right?

872
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:16,229
Scott: You know, it's gonna be like if you try talking about it Someone's either gonna be your best friend or they're gonna be your worst enemy, but Looney Tunes Everyone is just gonna be your regular friend.

873
00:52:22,652 --> 00:52:25,189
Scott: Those are is only a very few people who are that crazy.

874
00:52:25,732 --> 00:52:30,635
Scott: Right because by the at the point we are now right because remember think about it Looney Tunes is so old.

875
00:52:31,177 --> 00:52:34,410
Scott: even old people watched it even the old people grew up.

876
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:38,886
Rym: I actually never liked speedy Gonzales, really?

877
00:52:38,946 --> 00:52:39,890
Rym: I just didn't find him funny.

878
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:42,727
Scott: I mean, he wasn't as funny as the other ones, but he was.

879
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:43,190
Scott: he was alright.

880
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:49,310
Rym: But my favorite episode ever other than him torturing the opera guy and I just suddenly remembered it like out of nowhere.

881
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,454
Rym: This is one of those for the brain.

882
00:52:50,474 --> 00:52:51,739
Rym: like suddenly found a reference.

883
00:52:52,020 --> 00:53:01,670
Scott: Mm-hmm was haha turn duck, Perry Actually, you know what I never understood.

884
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,041
Scott: Sylvester and Tweety really really most of them.

885
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:08,155
Scott: I mean they were just sort of average always, you know That was never really like.

886
00:53:08,296 --> 00:53:08,658
Scott: oh, yeah.

887
00:53:08,678 --> 00:53:09,724
Scott: I was like, oh, okay.

888
00:53:09,784 --> 00:53:10,750
Scott: Why didn't Roadrunner come on?

889
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:17,430
Scott: And it seemed like there were just so many of them, you know, like it would always be semester

890
00:53:17,954 --> 00:53:29,129
Rym: I always saw the same one over and over again and it was all word that we're Sylvester and Tweety and the dog are all in the hospital with broken legs and the ladies trying to Take care of them and they keep trying to like kill each other from each other's beds.

891
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:34,130
Rym: Yeah, but there's also because that one was part of one of those stupid compilation movies and it was always on.

892
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:35,495
Scott: Yeah, that was an okay one.

893
00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:36,540
Scott: But I mean there was the.

894
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,283
Rym: it's about that.

895
00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:38,910
Rym: They're trying to murder each other.

896
00:53:39,312 --> 00:53:40,217
Rym: Yeah, the hospital.

897
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:44,769
Scott: but there was some other ones that would be like, you know It'd be the same thing every time just in a day.

898
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,612
Scott: It was like, okay now we're in the house in the winter and To eat.

899
00:53:47,632 --> 00:53:49,279
Scott: he's in the birdcage the best to try to eat him.

900
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:55,424
Scott: and now we're in the house in the suburbs and now we're In that different house and now the dog is there but now the dog isn't there.

901
00:53:55,745 --> 00:53:57,010
Scott: and now there's a mouse involved.

902
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:58,188
Scott: It was just the same.

903
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:01,930
Scott: You know, I was not, you know on with that.

904
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:05,203
Rym: I just I always wanted Sylvester to win because I didn't like Tweety.

905
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:06,830
Scott: That's another thing, right?

906
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:11,606
Scott: It's like you actually look at it and it's like, you know, it's Elmer Fudd really a bad guy.

907
00:54:11,626 --> 00:54:13,774
Scott: He's just a hunter He's just hunting.

908
00:54:13,794 --> 00:54:15,039
Scott: He's not any worse than any other hunter.

909
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:15,943
Scott: He's kind of dopey.

910
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:19,469
Scott: He's dopey but Bugs Bunny He was actually a jerk, right?

911
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:24,130
Rym: See at least Bugs Bunny I can understand why he'd be a jerk to Elmer Fudd because Elmer Fudd is trying to kill him.

912
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:29,750
Rym: Sometimes that opera episode Bugs Bunny is just like he basically tortures that guy to insanity.

913
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:38,070
Scott: Yeah, it's like sometimes he's trying to kill him But even then sometimes Bugs Bunny starts getting his revenge even before he's trying to kill him.

914
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:42,410
Scott: You know or he'll like, you know, plus that gun never killed anyone.

915
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:45,350
Scott: It just makes you look like, you know, you got exploded or whatever.

916
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:49,530
Scott: So it's like you're basically just forcing the other guy to get shot with it.

917
00:54:49,751 --> 00:54:58,419
Scott: You know, some of it actually was just sort of cruel and I guess, you know, the ones that like the you know I the one I like the most the mafia one.

918
00:54:58,439 --> 00:55:03,254
Scott: It was actually like look these are bad mafia guys You know, it was actually.

919
00:55:03,295 --> 00:55:07,730
Scott: there wasn't really any cruelty and he he got them in a very clever way.

920
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:08,817
Scott: Well, like Wile E.

921
00:55:08,837 --> 00:55:10,449
Rym: Coyote, who are you really rooting for?

922
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,798
Rym: You wanted him to get the stupid Roadrunner.

923
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:14,521
Scott: He was hungry.

924
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:17,615
Scott: Yeah, and the Roadrunner was just a bird It wasn't?

925
00:55:17,716 --> 00:55:19,410
Scott: you know that ran around really fast.

926
00:55:19,854 --> 00:55:24,124
Scott: It's like wow, if you can catch that fucking thing Look how fast things go.

927
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:28,275
Rym: I think we're done here.

928
00:55:28,295 --> 00:55:37,630
Scott: I mean, there's the only moral of this episode is that if you haven't actually seen Yeah, if you're if you're younger than us that means that you know and you you know.

929
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:42,586
Scott: Or maybe it means either a you don't really watch TV because TV the days of TV are over.

930
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:51,129
Scott: or be Looney Tunes Just weren't pervasive throughout all you know People as they were in our day or the days before us.

931
00:55:51,893 --> 00:55:55,470
Scott: But it's like I feel like we should keep that thing alive because we can keep that going.

932
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,739
Scott: That's even older than the Simpsons right?

933
00:55:57,799 --> 00:55:59,506
Scott: This is decades and decades old.

934
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:03,880
Rym: The Simpsons is only That it's older than the Simpsons.

935
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,930
Scott: It's like three or four times older than the Simpsons, right?

936
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:18,300
Scott: So and it's all on pirate bay Yeah, if we can keep it going right and make sure that it's in everyone's consciousness, you know It's it's in everyone's brain somewhere that can be.

937
00:56:18,361 --> 00:56:26,770
Scott: you know, just what we need there always has to be something It doesn't matter if it's Looney Tunes or something else that everyone has in their culture that what if it was the belief in?

938
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,839
Rym: Rationality in the than the beauty of science.

939
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:31,010
Scott: That would be good - that'd be good - good luck with that.
