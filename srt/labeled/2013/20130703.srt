1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,891
Rym: It's Wednesday, July 3rd, 2013, I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:19,280
Rym: Tonight, those quiet badasses.

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,397
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,360
Rym: Well, I guess they're not all quiet, but they're all badasses.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,620
Rym: But I got another biking story.

6
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:37,640
Rym: I guess GeekNights has the, we don't have the opening bit anymore, we just have the "So I was biking home from work" bit.

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,760
Scott: Hey, you know what my bit is?

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,060
Scott: I said I wasn't able to bike pretty much fucking all week with this rain.

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,099
Rym: I biked to work almost every day because I'm not a pansy.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,437
Scott: I had, you know, the different nights I had stuff to do, every night.

11
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:50,240
Scott: it was just, the rain was not on my schedule.

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:59,140
Rym: Yeah, well I got to admit, I biked to work this morning, but it just started to rain like right as I got to the office, and then it was fine when I left.

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,300
Scott: I used an umbrella to walk to the subway.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:13,460
Rym: Yeah, I'm biking over to the Pulaski, coming home, doing my thing, and there's this big dude who's kind of chubby and kind of angry looking, just kind of walking forward, blocking the whole bike path, the whole pedestrian way, so I can't get around him.

15
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:15,739
Rym: He's walking super slow right in the middle.

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,034
Rym: So I'm like, "Excuse

17
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:17,116
Rym: me?".

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,879
Rym: You know, I'm real polite and he doesn't respond, so I ding my bell.

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,058
Rym: He turns around, he's like, "Slow the fuck down, fucking

20
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:23,360
Rym: biker!".

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,598
Rym: He's just really mad at me.

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,503
Rym: So I scoot around him and I start to bike away, and he starts chasing, like, "Come back here

23
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:30,685
Rym: you!".

24
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:41,600
Rym: And I flipped him off, and then I heard him yell even more, and he got so mad, and I just biked away, because chubby, angry guy's not going to do much.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,397
Scott: What's he going to do?

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,439
Rym: I guess he would try to hit me if he got close enough to me.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,418
Scott: Listen, if he can chase me down while I'm riding my bike, my hat is off to you, good sir.

28
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,177
Scott: On foot?

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,020
Scott: In a friggin' all race, fucking Usain Bolt on my bike.

30
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:01,320
Rym: I did, as a kid, someone stole my bike.

31
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:02,460
Rym: I was in, like, middle school.

32
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,720
Scott: Usain Bolt's on foot, by the way.

33
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:15,439
Rym: I was in middle school, and I parked my bike, and I walked over to fuck around with this tree ford, and this bully kid, I hear a noise, and I look, and he's standing next to my bike, and he's getting on it and going to ride off with it.

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,660
Rym: I don't think he realized I was right there, up in the tree, watching him.

35
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,260
Rym: So I jump down, and I start chasing, and he sees me and tries to bike away.

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,078
Rym: Doesn't know how gears work.

37
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:34,238
Rym: So I ran up behind him, and I grabbed his shirt, and I pulled on it, and it didn't pull him over, but it ripped his shirt basically off and ruined it.

38
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,479
Rym: And then he turns around like he's gonna fight with me, and he gets off the bike, and bully kids tend to be big and slow.

39
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:45,978
Rym: So I ran around him, got on the bike, and then I just biked away, and I left him there with his broken shirt.

40
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,200
Rym: There's nothing else happened there.

41
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,858
Rym: That was the story.

42
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:54,838
Scott: If someone's on a bike, running away, what you want to do is run up and give them a good ol' check.

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Scott: They play shoulder ram right in the side.

44
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,193
Rym: Boom!

45
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,497
Rym: I'm pretty sure I could chase down most people who weren't good bikers if they tried to get away from me on a bike.

46
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:05,798
Rym: My bike or someone else's bike.

47
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,858
Scott: It's like if they pick up the bike and it's in high gear, they don't know how to shift down.

48
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:09,976
Scott: That's actually when I...

49
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,660
Rym: 'Cause sometimes I'll leave my bike outside the store, 'cause I'm gonna go in, get some ice cream, and then come right back out.

50
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,819
Rym: I can see it in the window.

51
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:21,520
Rym: I just put it in the highest gear, because the majority of bike thieves would not be able to get away in time.

52
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:29,812
Scott: Yeah, it's like, unless they toss it in the back of a truck, they're gonna get on and go, "Nyeh," and I'm gonna see them and easily be able to catch up and slam right into the street.

53
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,600
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:41,540
Rym: So, I was gonna link to this on the Anime News Network, but their DNS stopped working literally as we started to do GeekNights, so I can't actually visit their link.

55
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,620
Scott: Well, their loss is their loss.

56
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,279
Rym: However, the site I found is pretty cool.

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,157
Rym: It's all Sailor Moon-y.

58
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:54,359
Rym: So, the person who created Sailor Moon, Naoko Takeuchi, hasn't done an interview in over a decade.

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,813
Scott: Have they done anything besides?

60
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:57,720
Scott: make Sailor Moon?

61
00:03:58,221 --> 00:03:59,080
Rym: I don't actually know.

62
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,380
Rym: Sailor Moon is the only thing of hers that I know about.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Scott: It's the manga creator, right?

64
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:03,857
Scott: Yes.

65
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,215
Scott: Yeah.

66
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:06,980
Rym: I'll be honest, I don't really know anything about her other than Sailor Moon.

67
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,320
Scott: Are you the Sailor Moon fucking expert?

68
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:11,460
Rym: No, I just happen to have seen all of Sailor Moon.

69
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:15,180
Rym: If you have seen all of anything, you can speak to it.

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,116
Rym: You can probably say things that make you sound like an expert about Hokkaido Ken to someone who's never seen it.

71
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:30,917
Rym: But regardless, I learned from Wikipedia that she's a licensed pharmacist, and her senior thesis had the title "Heightened Effects of Thrombolytic Actions Due to

72
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:31,620
Rym: Ultrasound.".

73
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:32,660
Rym: Okay.

74
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,854
Rym: Anyway, she has not done an interview in 11 years.

75
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,200
Scott: But she's still been making manga?

76
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:42,540
Rym: She's made some stuff, doesn't look like much of it's that recent.

77
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:45,560
Rym: There's something called Tokimeka from 2006.

78
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,980
Scott: Is she just raking in Sailor Moon money and pharmacy money and not working?

79
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:56,499
Rym: In 2002 she did Love Witch, story of a girl receives a perfume bottle and becomes a witch, but it carries a heavy price.

80
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,459
Scott: Sounds fancy-lala-ish to me.

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,460
Rym: Discontinued after three chapters with no explanation.

82
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:04,840
Scott: Oh, because it wasn't because it was bad?

83
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,899
Rym: It was just- Has yet to be reprinted in any form.

84
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:07,780
Scott: Okay.

85
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,919
Scott: Let's find it on the internet.

86
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,759
Rym: Yeah, I kind of want to read that now.

87
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:23,220
Rym: But one, you should check this interview out because Sailor Moon, like it or not, seen it or not, is a pretty important anime in terms of the history of anime.

88
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:23,880
Scott: That's true.

89
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:36,055
Rym: And two, if you've seen the anime, especially if you've just seen what was on American TV, you've never read the manga, go find some of the Sailor Moon manga and just read a little bit of it.

90
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:37,879
Rym: Just check that out.

91
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:42,160
Rym: It's more like Green Lantern than you would expect.

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,360
Rym: And it mostly involves space drama.

93
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:48,920
Rym: But yeah, that's all I got here.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,360
Rym: I would say more, but again, the Anime News Network's DNS stopped working.

95
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:58,156
Rym: Oh, but the news is that she gave an interview for the first- The news that she gave and interview, the first one in supposedly 11 years.

96
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:00,160
Scott: What does it say in that interview?

97
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:00,799
Rym: I don't know.

98
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:01,939
Rym: I can't read the whole thing.

99
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:02,859
Scott: Okay.

100
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,340
Rym: I gotta search around for another site that has the interview.

101
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,400
Scott: Okay, so in real news, it's more important.

102
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:19,717
Scott: You know, I buy a lot of comic books every month and it's pretty great because I get a huge discount because pre-ordering, but it's pretty sucky because my house fills up with comic books.

103
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:22,379
Scott: I would much rather have digital comic books.

104
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:31,219
Scott: However, there are problems with digital comic books, unlike other forms of art and mediums such as anime or JPEGs or whatnot.

105
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,479
Scott: Comics do not translate perfectly to digitalness.

106
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:35,560
Rym: No they don't.

107
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:36,076
Scott: They do not.

108
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,280
Rym: Someday we'll have that technology.

109
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,620
Scott: A lot of these comic readers get like zoom in on a panel.

110
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,359
Scott: It's like, nope.

111
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,300
Scott: Or the ones it's like, oh, one page at a time.

112
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,380
Scott: It's like two page spread.

113
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,859
Rym: I know what the perfect interface is.

114
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:46,879
Rym: It's trivial.

115
00:06:47,442 --> 00:06:48,400
Rym: Magic paper.

116
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,420
Rym: Hologram.

117
00:06:49,462 --> 00:06:49,880
Rym: No, no magic paper.

118
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,420
Rym: No.

119
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,980
Rym: Overlay glasses and it just holds a perfect comic book in front of your face.

120
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,350
Scott: Yup.

121
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:56,818
Scott: Sure.

122
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:05,060
Scott: But anyway, the main reason I don't buy digital comics is because, you know, the only ones that are really like pirated.

123
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:11,180
Scott: You can go online and there's torrents fucking every week, like every DC comment that came out this week, every Marvel comment that came out this week.

124
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,620
Scott: But I don't want to read that shit.

125
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,080
Scott: Right.

126
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:17,458
Scott: I want to read all this other weird stuff that doesn't really get torrented, pirated as much.

127
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:21,239
Scott: It's not as easy to find because, you know, no one's really buying it.

128
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:29,939
Scott: Like who's buying and scanning, for example, you know, complete Prince Valiant hardcovers that are dragging nobody.

129
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:30,480
Scott: All right.

130
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,211
Scott: So I had to buy it.

131
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,559
Rym: But so you would you only buy stuff because you can't pirate it.

132
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:36,740
Scott: Yeah.

133
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:37,156
Scott: Yes.

134
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,469
Scott: OK.

135
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,640
Scott: Anyway, if it was digital and a reasonable price, I would pay for it like steam anyway.

136
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,920
Scott: So there are digital comics and most of them run comiXology and such.

137
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:49,513
Scott: But I don't like that shit because DRM.

138
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,439
Scott: Same reason I don't buy no Kindle books.

139
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,120
Scott: Right.

140
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:53,776
Scott: DRM's.

141
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:55,497
Scott: Don't tell me steam has DRM's.

142
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,560
Scott: Steam is a dollar.

143
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,859
Scott: ComiXology.

144
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:01,040
Scott: They're charging you the same price as the physical comics.

145
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:02,120
Scott: Go fuck your mother.

146
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,360
Scott: Even if there's no DRM, I'm not paying that price for a digital comic.

147
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:05,918
Scott: Go to hell.

148
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:08,858
Rym: Oh, wow.

149
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,100
Rym: Seventy bucks is the cheapest I can find.

150
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,717
Rym: One of the Prince Valiant's.

151
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:13,153
Scott: Yeah.

152
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,140
Scott: This is why preorder comics at a discount.

153
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:19,139
Scott: I bought it at thirty five percent off retail and I have all of them so far.

154
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:20,417
Scott: So take that.

155
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:25,598
Rym: Oh, here's a someone some guys selling for one hundred and twenty eight that hasn't been opened or read yet.

156
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,020
Scott: Mine's been opened in red anyway, anyway, anyway.

157
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,380
Scott: So there are sites that do DRM free digital comics.

158
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,600
Scott: We just get PDFs and such.

159
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,596
Scott: I think it's like my digital comics dot.

160
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:39,958
Scott: com.

161
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:40,600
Scott: Right.

162
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:48,220
Scott: But nobody really goes to those sites because they really only have, you know, sort of more obscure indie comics from publishers.

163
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:57,080
Scott: No one really cares about like, you know, you know, there's indie comics that are the ones that are like, you know, they're hot indie comics, like maybe from a publisher, like Top Shelf or Fanta Graphics.

164
00:08:57,341 --> 00:09:09,799
Scott: And then there's those indie comics that's like, oh, it's just that generic stuff that fills the shelves of the comic book store, like vampire something or zombie and girl with boobs and guns or shit like that.

165
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:10,360
Scott: Right.

166
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,998
Scott: That's the kind of stuff you're going to find on my digital comics dot.

167
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:13,220
Scott: com.

168
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,158
Scott: Well, big news.

169
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:21,640
Scott: Image comics redid their website to be less sucky because, you know, comic publishers usually don't have good websites.

170
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:30,399
Scott: And part of that is they put DRM free comics for sale directly on their website in PDF, EPUB, CBR or CBZ.

171
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,700
Scott: So any format you want.

172
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,620
Scott: Not bad problem pricing.

173
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:35,980
Scott: Still not so good.

174
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,898
Scott: Oh, how bad?

175
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:38,820
Scott: Well, it's not as bad, really.

176
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,399
Scott: It's pretty much like old comics are like a dollar each and brand new ones are the same price as the print.

177
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:46,999
Scott: So still not buying it.

178
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:48,940
Scott: But that's a major publisher.

179
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,899
Scott: Images number three.

180
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:54,600
Scott: And in fact, I see myself on my order forms ordering more image comics.

181
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,260
Scott: I mean, fucking saga, right?

182
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:56,978
Scott: That's fucking image.

183
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,040
Rym: Oh, my God.

184
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:00,440
Rym: I need to read the next trade of saga.

185
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,277
Scott: I read it.

186
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,319
Scott: I have not yet.

187
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:02,734
Scott: I own it.

188
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:04,167
Scott: I need to borrow.

189
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,079
Scott: that lives up to the hype.

190
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:07,318
Rym: Of course it does.

191
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:08,599
Scott: It's no joke.

192
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:18,819
Rym: I can see in my Twitter feed as the issues come out, because it's good enough to where a lot of people I know who otherwise are trades only end up getting issues anyway.

193
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:21,560
Scott: You can pay for these digital issues every freaking month.

194
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,500
Rym: No, I'm just going to read the trades that you buy.

195
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,740
Rym: See, I don't pirate anything.

196
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,940
Rym: I just borrow your comics.

197
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,738
Scott: That's a good deal.

198
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,955
Rym: Scott's library is open for business, but yeah, that Sailor Moon interview did not happen yet.

199
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:37,336
Rym: Oh, it will be available on August 1st.

200
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:38,508
Scott: Mm.

201
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,120
Scott: Interesting.

202
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:40,860
Scott: Did the interview happen?

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,480
Scott: Is it not published or the interview didn't happen?

204
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,479
Rym: It's going to be published in a women's fashion magazine, Rolla.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,440
Scott: Interesting.

206
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:48,793
Scott: Yeah.

207
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,840
Scott: All right.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,599
Scott: Maybe she's working on some Sailor Moon fashions.

209
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,880
Scott: Uh, so yeah, image is now making DRM free comics.

210
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:08,620
Scott: So if you're into the digital comics like, uh, I'm not, and you're willing to pay the cover price or slightly less than government price for old stuff, then you don't want to pirate you because image comics are probably easily parable.

211
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:13,520
Scott: You can go to image comics is official website and buy DRM free comics.

212
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,257
Scott: This is a big deal.

213
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:22,157
Scott: Uh, hopefully like the whole comics industry can sort of do stuff like this and really put the pressure on Marvel and DC to get one.

214
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:33,860
Rym: Because if the, even if, if the prices don't change just as long as it's all available digital for at least no more than the physical copy, I think that'll cause a big seismic shift culturally.

215
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,040
Scott: I think really what they need to do is it's good to sell it on their website.

216
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:40,740
Scott: Obviously that's good for them because they get all the money from sales, right?

217
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,720
Scott: But what they should also do is if it's DRM free, it's like also sell it on Amazon.

218
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:46,340
Scott: Also sell it on Apple.

219
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:57,899
Rym: All here's the trouble for the business model where they have, instead of having 4,000 people reading a comic, they have 1000 people who buy each of the four alternate covers.

220
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,542
Rym: Hmm.

221
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:14,400
Scott: So it'll actually cut down on their, I mean, if there's digital copies, the nerds, but they save money, I'm not paying to print the paper, even though that isn't a good, the significant cost, the significant cost is paying artists to make the comics, right?

222
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:25,039
Rym: So what they should do is sell it digitally for price X and then only print like 500 copies or a hundred copies of each alternate cover and sell those for like 40 bucks.

223
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,438
Scott: Here's what they should do.

224
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,620
Rym: So double down on that.

225
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,515
Scott: Here's what they should do.

226
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:36,019
Scott: Image comics should just be like, look, you pay us 25 bucks a month or a hundred a year, some price like that.

227
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,660
Scott: The kind of prices that make you go, Ooh, right with the small annual fee like flicker or the small monthly fee like Spotify or something.

228
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:46,559
Scott: And you just fricking get every image comic, no matter what.

229
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:54,119
Scott: And as they just had to, then they just had to make enough image comics that are good enough to get you to do that.

230
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:03,820
Rym: There is a trouble with that model that from everything I've read, Spotify basically pays out rounding down to zero to pretty much everyone.

231
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:07,620
Scott: Let's talk about that a little bit before we get off, you know, even though it's a tangent.

232
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:13,040
Rym: I mean, they were getting back into an issue that has not had new discussions since 1994.

233
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,151
Rym: Right.

234
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:13,780
Scott: It is true.

235
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,779
Scott: But there was one point someone made recently that I did not think of.

236
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:17,280
Scott: Right.

237
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:19,709
Scott: And they were talking about how Pandora basically pays.

238
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:26,711
Scott: almost some guy, I think he's a songwriter was like, I get basically get nothing when my song is played on Pandora, but it's a huge hit.

239
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,700
Scott: It's been played millions of times and I got almost nothing.

240
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,080
Scott: I'm curious if you're going to say what I was about to say probably, but basically number one is that Pandora actually paid out a lot more than what he got.

241
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,660
Scott: All these other people took a cut, right?

242
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,400
Scott: The record company, the other people who played the music, the et cetera, et cetera.

243
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:41,696
Scott: Right.

244
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:55,040
Scott: But the real reason, uh, is that he didn't get as much money as say a play on the radio is that he was, these people were comparing the one radio play to the one Spotify play or the one Pandora play.

245
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,540
Scott: It's like one Pandora play is heard by one person.

246
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,439
Scott: One radio play is heard by more than one person.

247
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,720
Rym: One radio play is heard by one old person.

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,196
Scott: I know.

249
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,930
Scott: I'm just saying theoretically.

250
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,480
Scott: more than one person hears the one radio play.

251
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:18,960
Scott: So a one radio play is worth multiple times as much money as a Spotify play, which is one person playing the song one time, which really has almost no value.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,721
Scott: If you consider that paying a dollar to iTunes for a song is infinite plays of a song, what is?

253
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:29,360
Scott: one play of the song costs almost nothing, right?

254
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,053
Scott: Even at the $1 overpriced iTunes price.

255
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:35,840
Scott: So they're actually getting pretty good money from a Spotify iTunes.

256
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,720
Scott: So what is one read of a comic worth to what?

257
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,054
Scott: Right.

258
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:44,660
Scott: Not much, you know, definitely not $4 that they charge at the comic book store.

259
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,233
Scott: That's for sure.

260
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:46,618
Scott: Dollar at most.

261
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,473
Rym: Yeah.

262
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:55,077
Rym: But at the same time, it depends that the more niche your comic is, the fewer people are interested in it, but it doesn't really get cheaper to make it.

263
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:56,600
Scott: Hey, listen.

264
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,356
Scott: Yeah.

265
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:58,379
Scott: It's the world we live in.

266
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:58,960
Rym: Deal with it.

267
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,699
Rym: This is the hand we're given.

268
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:09,440
Scott: I think, you know, Image could also companies, these comic companies could also do much better to drop a lot of the shitty fucking comics.

269
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,040
Scott: Like what good comics does Image have?

270
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,537
Scott: Walking Dead and Chew and Saga.

271
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:16,939
Scott: What else they got?

272
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,037
Scott: Right.

273
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,218
Scott: It's like, why are you even publishing all that garbage?

274
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:22,220
Scott: It's like, yeah, give new stuff a shot.

275
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,220
Scott: But if it doesn't work, it's like, yeah, you got five issues.

276
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:24,917
Scott: Then you're out of here.

277
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:27,418
Scott: If it's not as big as Mouse Guard, fuck it.

278
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,909
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

279
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:44,707
Rym: So Collectivet is a, appears to be a Norwegian comedy group, and they do funny songs and other things.

280
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,589
Rym: And Emily found this for me.

281
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:54,090
Rym: They have this funny song, it's in English, where they go through the idea that bigger is better and size matters.

282
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,468
Scott: So the United States- Making fun of the big fat US.

283
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,330
Rym: So the United States wins at everything.

284
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:03,030
Rym: We have the biggest amusement parks, the biggest people, aka they're fat.

285
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,750
Scott: They're like- Biggest cars.

286
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,670
Rym: You're so fat, you're so big, you're dying of it.

287
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,628
Rym: We can't compete with that.

288
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,449
Scott: Biggest hats.

289
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,450
Rym: But they point out the one area where Norway wins.

290
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,747
Rym: They have a bigger alphabet than we do because they've got the I-O-O.

291
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:24,369
Rym: The A-E that are stuck together, the O with the line through it, and the A with a funny little circle on top.

292
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:26,549
Scott: They don't have anything with two dots on it?

293
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,589
Rym: Well, those are accents as opposed to letters.

294
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:30,310
Scott: Okay.

295
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:45,610
Rym: There's a difference between a letter that has an accent like an E with an accente gear, or accent circumflex, or accent grave, or a C-C-D, and an actually different letter, even though that is an entirely arbitrary distinction.

296
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,309
Rym: Their alphabet has I-O-O in it.

297
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:49,706
Scott: Where do they put the I-O-O?

298
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,509
Scott: Is it A-I-O-O?

299
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:52,829
Rym: I'm going to find out right now.

300
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,729
Rym: Google Images.

301
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:55,387
Scott: How do they sing the alphabet song?

302
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,849
Rym: I'm going to find out, Norway.

303
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,289
Scott: While you do that, I'm going to do my thing of the day.

304
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:06,147
Scott: So, when I was a baby, as in zero, in the womb of my mom.

305
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,164
Rym: In Queens.

306
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:08,785
Scott: In, yeah.

307
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:13,049
Scott: She would be sitting around, all pregnant and shit, and what would she do?

308
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,872
Rym: Play the Atari 2600.

309
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:15,021
Scott: With?

310
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:16,229
Scott: What game?

311
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,230
Scott: What was my mom's favorite game?

312
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:18,930
Scott: Super Breakout.

313
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,430
Scott: Super Breakout was my mom's game.

314
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,770
Scott: She still loves that fucking game.

315
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,390
Rym: You know, it's funny because my mom has the same story.

316
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,410
Rym: Maybe that's why- But your mom didn't play Super Breakout.

317
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:26,049
Scott: She played other games.

318
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,970
Rym: She played regular Breakout, she liked it more, and a bunch of other games, but did your mom do the same thing?

319
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:38,769
Rym: When my mom was super pregnant, it was hard to lean over and hit the reset button, so she liked the 2600 because she'd reach over with her toe and tap the reset button.

320
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,224
Scott: I don't know.

321
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:39,866
Scott: Ask her.

322
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,608
Scott: Anyway, she played on a tiny black and white TV.

323
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,950
Scott: But anyway, yeah, Super Breakout.

324
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,590
Scott: So, I played Super Breakout since before I was born.

325
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:47,429
Scott: That's how good I am.

326
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,501
Scott: So, you think, I've seen pretty much every Breakout.

327
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,249
Scott: there's been for as long as Breakouts existed.

328
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:55,228
Scott: There has not been a Breakout that has escaped me.

329
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,130
Scott: Here is one that was totally new and amazing.

330
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:06,189
Scott: This is Brick Smash, Brick Smash, Brick, Brick Smash, Brick, whatever, by Alan Hazelden, the creator of this.

331
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,190
Scott: My hat is off to you.

332
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:13,670
Scott: It's a tiny flash game, and basically you play Breakout, and in each of the bricks and the Breakout, there is another game of Breakout.

333
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,730
Scott: It is Brickception.

334
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:16,849
Scott: It's incredible.

335
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,129
Scott: Yo, dawg, Breakout.

336
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:19,230
Scott: You have to play this.

337
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,189
Scott: I won on my first try.

338
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,269
Scott: Rym did, and I'm better than Rym.

339
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:26,148
Rym: Okay, so if you look for the Norwegian alphabet song, you just keep finding this comedy video that I'm linking to.

340
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,629
Rym: But their alphabet, a, u, o, are in order at the end.

341
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,010
Scott: Oh, so it's just z, a, u, o. Okay.

342
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:35,589
Rym: So, they just added them at the end there.

343
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:37,463
Rym: They also have accents.

344
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,430
Rym: They have an accent, a, u, the up line, the down line, the hat.

345
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,090
Rym: That's it.

346
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:45,869
Scott: Do they have the two dots?

347
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,218
Rym: No.

348
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,750
Rym: They do not have the two dots.

349
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,589
Scott: You gotta have the two dots.

350
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:48,998
Rym: Why?

351
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,200
Rym: Why?

352
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,189
Rym: What are the good of the two dots?

353
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,766
Rym: Do you even know what the two dots do?

354
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:08,750
Rym: So, in the meta moment, the book club book is Stasi-land, true narrative stories of the bullshit people went through living in East Germany under the Stasi during the Cold War.

355
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:12,190
Rym: It's kind of relevant with all the NSA stuff going on.

356
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,650
Scott: The next book club book is going to be Gideon's Bible.

357
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:22,149
Rym: Then the next book club book is going to be Ulysses or Norwich's history of the Byzantine empire.

358
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,930
Scott: And the one after that will be Dead Sea Scrolls, the real edition.

359
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,220
Rym: I'm going with Webster's.

360
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:31,330
Scott: Okay.

361
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:33,530
Rym: No, the OED because it's longer.

362
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,650
Scott: The complete works of Dostoevsky in Russian.

363
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,990
Rym: The first story, once it gets past kind of the intro, is pretty good.

364
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:51,990
Rym: And it's about this 16 year old girl who actually tried to go over the wall because she got arrested and held in solitary confinement and was tortured.

365
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,010
Scott: How was that barbed wire?

366
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,288
Rym: She got over the barbed wire okay.

367
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:55,910
Scott: Nice.

368
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,148
Rym: She got past the dogs too.

369
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:57,665
Scott: Nice.

370
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:08,950
Rym: And the Stasi, it's interesting because people have this impression in the West that the Stasi were this like almost Nazi-esque level of control.

371
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:10,408
Rym: And that's kind of true.

372
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:20,190
Rym: But at the same time, a lot of what they would do was so utterly and patently ridiculous, but yet they would do it seriously and with a straight face.

373
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:26,010
Rym: It's a weird part of world history that I don't think enough people know about.

374
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,848
Rym: And the more I'm reading this book, the weirder it is.

375
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:34,210
Scott: Yet another group that had really great fashion sense that you can't use anymore.

376
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:34,806
Rym: The Nazis.

377
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,106
Scott: And the Stasi.

378
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:36,908
Scott: The Stasi too.

379
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,369
Scott: They had those awesome leather coats with the...

380
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:40,183
Rym: There's something about that sharp look.

381
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,449
Rym: Why can't we have scientific fascism?

382
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:46,309
Scott: What do you mean?

383
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,004
Rym: I don't know.

384
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:53,269
Rym: All the trappings of fascism, but with the goal of making awesome science, making everything great for everyone.

385
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:58,970
Scott: So we can wear evil looking coats, but they have no swastikas or anything on them.

386
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:00,370
Scott: People know that we're good.

387
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,110
Scott: We just really like, we just respect good fashion.

388
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:03,669
Scott: We should call it.

389
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:10,950
Scott: And then we're going to call ourselves the grand dragons and be like, look, we fucking hate the KKK, those assholes, but they took all the good names.

390
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:11,809
Scott: We're going to be there.

391
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,588
Scott: No, it doesn't work.

392
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:13,849
Scott: We can't take it back.

393
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:17,250
Scott: The fashion and the names, I've let them go long ago.

394
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:20,608
Scott: I just like to complain about it every once in a while, but I've given up.

395
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:26,989
Scott: There is no way to take those awesome fashions or awesome names back without bringing also the evil.

396
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,429
Rym: I mean, even the Charlie Chaplin mustache has been destroyed by all this.

397
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,130
Scott: Anyway.

398
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,401
Scott: Other metas.

399
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:35,230
Rym: ConnectiCon.

400
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,530
Scott: It's like fucking tomorrow.

401
00:21:36,654 --> 00:21:36,860
Scott: Next.

402
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:37,870
Rym: God damn.

403
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,229
Rym: Well, the schedule of the panels that we are running ourselves, I don't even know what those are.

404
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:44,810
Rym: I got to go look them up because I forget.

405
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:45,626
Scott: Great.

406
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:46,589
Rym: Uh, yeah.

407
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,670
Rym: ConnectiCon is going to be awesome.

408
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,450
Rym: And then Scott and I are immediately flying to Australia to present beyond judges and dragons in the Wombat theater.

409
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:51,851
Rym: 1 p.m.

410
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:56,530
Rym: on Friday in Melbourne, Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.

411
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,790
Scott: Just if you want to pronounce Melbourne correctly, Melbourne, imagine it's M E L B I N. Melbourne.

412
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,770
Rym: Forget that R. Forget the O U. Melbourne.

413
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:07,510
Rym: Yeah.

414
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:08,149
Scott: Melbourne.

415
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:08,608
Scott: Anyway.

416
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,077
Scott: Yeah.

417
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:11,289
Rym: Um, we got to plan the rest of this trip.

418
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:12,189
Scott: Yeah, it's fine.

419
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:12,889
Rym: So far.

420
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,650
Rym: I've not planned beyond, beyond dungeons and dragons.

421
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,323
Scott: Okay.

422
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:24,208
Scott: You know, if we just get there and ask natives, like what's the awesomest thing, you know, we'll end up doing the good stuff.

423
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,430
Rym: What a plan ahead a little bit.

424
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,790
Rym: I kind of want to do those go-karts.

425
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,348
Rym: I got to trick someone in Melbourne.

426
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,167
Scott: Uh, organizing it.

427
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:31,669
Rym: To organize it.

428
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,769
Scott: So we needed to show other people to do it.

429
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,609
Scott: We can't just make it happen on our own.

430
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,930
Rym: We can do it Sunday after packs.

431
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,509
Rym: I think we could get enough people from packs.

432
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:51,590
Rym: Maybe our first packs in the U S. we trivially formed what can only be described as a mob by snapping our fingers and saying, moonblazing, burning whale, signed up in advance and shit.

433
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:52,524
Rym: Anyway, I'll figure it out.

434
00:22:53,431 --> 00:23:05,770
Scott: Um, any other meta moments you should, while we're away and we're not going to be making a lot of stuff for you, pretty much the rest of July after next week or so is going to be like nothing, uh, in terms of GeekNights.

435
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:18,807
Scott: So you're going to want to go to our YouTubes and other such and follow us on the internet and the Twitters and all those places, because that's the only place is going to be content because that's the only place we can post things while we're on the go, like Lord of the rings on the go.

436
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:24,430
Scott: So you're going to watch our flicker, see some photos from Australia and kinetic con and all that kind of stuff.

437
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:30,458
Scott: So make sure you follow GeekNights and me and Rym at all the internet places, the Google pluses, the Facebooks, not only that.

438
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,810
Rym: you want us to do GeekNights, presents you 10 faster.

439
00:23:34,192 --> 00:23:36,650
Rym: You want us to ever make another radio for Equestria.

440
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:41,390
Rym: You want the four other, well, I guess five other lectures, man in Boston, rerecorded.

441
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:44,118
Rym: Uh, I'm taking my sweet ass time.

442
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:49,189
Rym: unless you guys do what you did with our, uh, judge anime by its cover and get the views up.

443
00:23:49,952 --> 00:23:53,009
Scott: If you get like three or four videos up, so now you have to do another one.

444
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:53,390
Scott: Yeah.

445
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,430
Rym: Get more views up the more views up, look, they put the views up and what happened?

446
00:23:57,732 --> 00:24:00,030
Rym: I almost immediately released on other GeekNights presents.

447
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:03,390
Rym: In fact, I ordered new lights that we're going to use right after packs.

448
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:03,864
Rym: Awesome.

449
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:04,422
Rym: Ooh.

450
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:05,018
Scott: Ooh.

451
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:05,705
Rym: Yes.

452
00:24:06,515 --> 00:24:07,530
Scott: All right.

453
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:09,010
Scott: So meta moments over.

454
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,650
Scott: It is time for the episode.

455
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:26,750
Rym: So I realized we realized we were talking about anime and we, we kind of, there's that, there's a certain kind of character that everybody loves and whenever there's a show that has a character like that, it's always the like unstated, obviously the best character.

456
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:27,389
Scott: Yup.

457
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,130
Rym: But in this particular way, it's the Hughes in the full metal alchemist.

458
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:37,670
Scott: Usually this character is usually a dude, but not always usually old, but not always.

459
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:44,850
Rym: I think already there's a distinct separation of two kinds of the anime bad-ass kind.

460
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:50,530
Rym: Number one, the old master, the old invincible sensei, right?

461
00:24:50,911 --> 00:24:55,970
Scott: It's like the main character, you know, is leveling up in an anime, getting more powerful.

462
00:24:56,098 --> 00:24:56,310
Scott: Right.

463
00:24:56,591 --> 00:24:58,150
Scott: But how can the main character learn anything?

464
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,749
Scott: If they're the most powerful, there is someone who is so ridiculously powerful, but doesn't use it.

465
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:11,730
Scott: Just like in the Simpsons episode, the guy in the white suit who stands still and doesn't do anything when he does something, holy crap, it's going to be the best, right?

466
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:16,670
Scott: For example, in Kill Bill 2, Pi Mei is the bad-ass, right?

467
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,150
Scott: You know, he's so much stronger than everyone else, but he just started chills out and doesn't use his full power.

468
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:26,488
Scott: That's the guy, you know, in Initial D, crazy Bunta, right?

469
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,888
Scott: He's not in the races.

470
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:35,289
Scott: You just know he could win every race with like his eyes closed because he's that much better, but he stays in the sidelines and watches.

471
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:35,623
Rym: Yup.

472
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:46,189
Rym: Now these guys, we were trying to think of all the examples of that kind of guy and they're all really, really similar, at least in a superficial two minute conversation.

473
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:51,367
Rym: because the first people we thought of, let's see if there's Bunta, there's Aramaki in Ghost in the Shell.

474
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:58,929
Rym: Who's, especially now we're going to see him younger with brown hair, like it's not fully clowned out yet, not Wilead all the way.

475
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:10,185
Rym: There's Fujisawa Sensei in El Hazard and notice how they all will often have sort of a smoking or drinking or some sort of like thing.

476
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:10,930
Rym: that's up with them.

477
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:16,608
Rym: Like they're not 100% the best people or they have some sort of flaw or past.

478
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:18,949
Rym: that's dark, but that's not the story.

479
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:23,290
Scott: Who's the guy in Naruto who's always reading, the teacher who's reading the porn magazines all the time.

480
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:25,150
Scott: I always forget his name.

481
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,486
Rym: Forget his name too because Naruto stopped being good after 3.5 episodes.

482
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,310
Scott: Let me look at list of Naruto characters on the Internet.

483
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:42,530
Rym: Plus I don't think he is the invincible sensei anymore, but he did serve that purpose in that part of the show, though he was too young to hold it off in the long run.

484
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:44,610
Scott: I think it's Kakashi.

485
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:45,440
Rym: Yup.

486
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,366
Rym: That's definitely him.

487
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:51,726
Rym: Wow, all the young anime fans listening to GeekNights are like, "How do you not

488
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:52,007
Rym: know?"

489
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:53,447
Rym: Right?

490
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,930
Scott: In one piece, it's Red Shanks, right?

491
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,589
Scott: Red Shanks, the guy you hardly ever see.

492
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:58,962
Scott: Yup.

493
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,569
Rym: Because he's in the beginning, he's the badass, loses his arm.

494
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:02,255
Scott: Yup.

495
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,363
Rym: Spoilers.

496
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:21,790
Rym: But then there's the other kind of badass, the young, not invincible guy, who is the badass and seems to often get killed in a pivotal plot point because they're not the main character, they're not a villain, but they're the badass that makes the impossible possible.

497
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:22,323
Rym: Mm-hmm.

498
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:30,209
Rym: The Moolaflaga, the Hughes, the Fokker, in fact, I think all three of them serve basically the same purpose in their three respective shows.

499
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:40,450
Scott: But even those guys are sort of like incredibly powerful, older than main character, sensei-ish mentor figures, right?

500
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:45,010
Scott: They just sort of are more active than, say, a bunta on the sidelines.

501
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:53,530
Rym: Well, I think with them, it's really that they're the characters that the show starts and they're already way leveled up and almost no one else around them is.

502
00:27:53,871 --> 00:28:00,490
Rym: They're the only ones who can pull shit off, they're the only competent ones, they're the only cool ones, and they're not on screen that often.

503
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:01,927
Rym: I think that's the key.

504
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:05,888
Rym: It's the same thing with King Cosma in Summer Wars.

505
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,598
Rym: It's the character where people watch a show and they think back and it's like, "Who's your favorite

506
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:11,007
Rym: character?"

507
00:28:11,695 --> 00:28:13,088
Rym: With 90% of people like King Cosma.

508
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:13,887
Scott: Yeah, duh.

509
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:15,329
Rym: Mula Flaga, Hughes.

510
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:16,210
Scott: Yep.

511
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:22,430
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's someone that is showing you what the future can be like, right?

512
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,507
Scott: Like, you play Mega Man X and at the beginning of Mega Man X, it's just like this equalitis video.

513
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,570
Scott: Mega Man X is kind of weak ass, he just woke up from his friggin' stasis, whatever, but you know what?

514
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,407
Scott: Zero's out there.

515
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:39,910
Scott: Total badass, already leveled up, and then it's eventually you get the main guy, Mega Man X, eventually is better than Zero, but not right away.

516
00:28:40,872 --> 00:28:42,990
Scott: It's showing you the future, right?

517
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:48,401
Scott: It's like, "Oh yeah, Mula Flaga at the beginning is, yeah, the competent pilot, and you know what?

518
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,850
Scott: These kids are just some fucking kids at the beginning of Gundam Seed.

519
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,030
Scott: You know at the end of Gundam Seed?

520
00:28:52,570 --> 00:29:04,946
Scott: Those kids are now the really powerful people, and Mula Flaga's still pretty good, but basically they leveled up to his level, but he was so high level, he really only gained one level over the show because he needs so much XP to get one

521
00:29:04,987 --> 00:29:05,168
Scott: more.".

522
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:10,150
Rym: I don't think anyone ever gets better than Punta.

523
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:11,829
Scott: I don't think ever, no.

524
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:13,989
Scott: I haven't read enough Initial D, but I don't think so.

525
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,170
Scott: I think Punta pretty much stays at the most powerful.

526
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,490
Rym: So why do we like these characters?

527
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:22,370
Rym: Why do they stand out so much to us in particular?

528
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:27,130
Rym: I don't know if it's universal that other people think about this or are obsessed with these characters.

529
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,168
Rym: It might just be us.

530
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:36,250
Rym: I mean, when normal people talk about Ghost in the Shell, they're like, "Oh, the major, the best," or "Bato, hey," but we're just always Aromaki.

531
00:29:36,874 --> 00:29:37,868
Rym: Is it because we're getting old?

532
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:40,790
Scott: Well, you know, I don't dislike those other characters.

533
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:46,708
Scott: In fact, I think I like Togusa the most in Ghost in the Shell, but Aromaki is still the baddest ass.

534
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,230
Scott: You know, Togus is not exactly a bad ass, he's just sort of, you know, cool, whatever.

535
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,610
Scott: But yeah, why do we like these bad ass characters?

536
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,244
Scott: Well, I think it's because number one, right?

537
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:04,532
Scott: These characters are super powerful, but they're not super powerful in like an evil boss kind of way.

538
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:10,222
Scott: or we're just going to make the show boring and use my superpowers to end the conflicts kind of way, right?

539
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:23,910
Scott: Is they're super powerful in sort of a funny way and it sort of creates this contrast of, you know, like you want to see them in action so bad, like this hidden mystery power.

540
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:35,710
Rym: Well, like Fujisawa, when he learns his kick and his punch and he's just, he's such a bad ass, but he's also such a moron at times, but he's not a complete moron.

541
00:30:36,931 --> 00:30:43,010
Rym: But yet, this is distinct from Captain Tyler, let's say, where he is the plot, he is the main character.

542
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,350
Rym: It always feels like cheating where your favorite character is the main character.

543
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:52,868
Rym: I mean, if your favorite character in Hooka Nona Ken is Ken Shiro, that feels really obvious or cheap.

544
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:53,449
Scott: Yep.

545
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,189
Scott: It's okay.

546
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:58,528
Rym: And I think there's a lot of anime fans, because I know a bunch of people we knew at RIT would do this.

547
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,930
Rym: They kind of like to like the obscure character that no one else likes.

548
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:12,190
Scott: Well, I think the thing is in animes in particular, and a lot of stories, main characters have to be appealing to everybody, to a wide audience.

549
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,545
Scott: So they're very generic, they're not, you know, the kind of thing that would appeal to only one person.

550
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:24,710
Scott: So like in a harem show, right, let's say it's a girl harem, there's one girl and a whole bunch of dudes in this harem, it's a dude harem, whatever you want to call it.

551
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,809
Scott: But a lot of dudes, one girl.

552
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:33,509
Scott: That girl isn't going to have a lot of character to her usually, it's going to be someone that every girl can identify with in some way.

553
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:38,570
Scott: And then all it's sort of like a harem combined and merged into one person.

554
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:59,570
Scott: Whereas the harem itself is a bunch of separate individuals that are all really specific and everyone's going to like one of them or maybe two of them, right, that are going to be sort of the ones, you know, and then there might be one in the harem that has a wider appeal than that's the one that you're actually going to get together with in the story at some point, right?

555
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:05,290
Rym: I think there's some characters that sort of fall between, like they're not like they serve that purpose in the beginning, but don't later.

556
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:19,769
Rym: Like Toga in Utena actually, in the beginning of the show, he seems like the only one who's got it together and he knows more, he's secret, he's mysterious, he's badass, but then you learn about other people who know way more.

557
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:38,409
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, that's an interesting, that's what makes Utena really good, but it's also something that, you know, where they made a use out of that character instead of just having them there to be a character that people like to set a contrast, to help the main character by giving them advice and stuff like that.

558
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:43,710
Scott: They actually brought them into the plot and made a use out of them without them overpowering everything.

559
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,450
Scott: Right.

560
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:47,690
Scott: And in Toga's case, it's like, yeah, he wasn't as bad as you thought, right?

561
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:55,190
Scott: Bunta, if they would have brought Bunta into things, you know, and made him race or something, it's like, well, that sort of ruins everything, right?

562
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:59,270
Scott: Because he can't lose, you know, there's not going to be any drama there if that happens, right?

563
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:03,190
Scott: They would have had to bring Bunta down to give you doubt about Bunta's power.

564
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:09,190
Scott: And you can't do that, that every, every race, it's the key, he's not going to win this time.

565
00:33:09,431 --> 00:33:09,601
Scott: Yeah.

566
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:16,409
Scott: The other ability, the other possibility to bring everyone else up to Bunta's level, which is like, hell no, that's not going to happen.

567
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,209
Scott: That's Dragon Ball.

568
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,329
Scott: Maybe you can have Bunta versus Michael Schumacher.

569
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,296
Rym: That might work.

570
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:25,644
Scott: But otherwise, no, you know, but it's like some animes.

571
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:27,350
Scott: it's or mangas.

572
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,650
Scott: It's hard to figure out.

573
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:30,078
Scott: Is there such a character?

574
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,390
Rym: or most shows do not have these characters.

575
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:43,110
Rym: I've realized as an aside, I was looking for just like a giant list of anime that were popular like top hundred list to scroll through just to kind of remind myself of, oh yeah.

576
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,128
Rym: And that show, there was that guy.

577
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:51,769
Rym: So my only point is this pretty much every top X anime list on the internet is ridiculously bullshit.

578
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:52,669
Scott: No credit.

579
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,330
Rym: Here's, here's one that's actually pretty popular.

580
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,090
Rym: Fullmetal Alchemist is number two of all time.

581
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:58,750
Rym: Alpha leaves.

582
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,504
Rym: Number six.

583
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,094
Rym: Whoa.

584
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:00,745
Rym: What?

585
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,730
Rym: Cowboy Bebop's number five.

586
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,782
Scott: Why is it not number one?

587
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,409
Rym: I was 37, but Naruto's at 35.

588
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:11,790
Scott: So copy of up and I was among the two great shows that do not have such a character.

589
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,389
Rym: Most shows don't have these characters.

590
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:17,989
Rym: Escaflowne almost had one, Alan Chazar, but he's basically a toga.

591
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:18,730
Scott: He's not yet.

592
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,389
Scott: He's not strong enough to be that guy.

593
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:25,849
Scott: The main character is actually the most powerful in that show and doesn't really have mentor action going on.

594
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:30,429
Rym: You don't have the awesome side character except for you have the old instructor in the beginning, but he dies.

595
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,268
Scott: He's not, he's not an awesome, whatever.

596
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:39,310
Scott: And even jelly and you can have someone, what's his name?

597
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:40,589
Scott: Kaji.

598
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:44,130
Rym: He's sort of the, well, Kaji is the Hughes.

599
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:45,168
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

600
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:45,578
Scott: Yeah.

601
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,708
Rym: Again, look at the pattern.

602
00:34:48,091 --> 00:34:56,449
Rym: The characters that are the younger stereotype of the bad-ass or at least the favorite side character or all the certain way.

603
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,789
Rym: And then the old ones are another certain way that, but there isn't an old one in Evangelion.

604
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,527
Rym: There's just the Hughes.

605
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:07,510
Scott: Well, like in star Wars, it's Yoda or Boba Fett or both of us.

606
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,147
Scott: The bad one.

607
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:08,490
Rym: Yeah.

608
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,908
Rym: But at the same time, you know, we said it had to be on the good guy side.

609
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,829
Rym: Is that really true?

610
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:20,470
Rym: Because star Wars, maybe this explains this thing we're talking about why Boba Fett appears briefly in star Wars.

611
00:35:21,192 --> 00:35:23,929
Rym: He is barely part of star Wars at all.

612
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:29,490
Rym: And yet when I was a kid and I saw star Wars for the first time, my friends all saw star Wars.

613
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,594
Rym: Boba Fett was all.

614
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:34,809
Rym: anyone could fucking talk about Boba Fett, but everyone was obsessed with Boba Fett.

615
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,208
Rym: No matter how sure I am, I never risked the Fett.

616
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,889
Scott: Boba Fett never risked the Fett man.

617
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:42,090
Rym: So I think it's the same thing.

618
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,210
Rym: There's something about that secondary badass character.

619
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:53,950
Rym: And if I had to guess psychologically, I think it really just comes down to the mystery that you don't know their full deal.

620
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:59,330
Rym: So you can kind of fill in way more than you can with even a main character.

621
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:06,910
Rym: Cause even in a harem show, a main character has some kind of plot and there's some sort of framework, but Boba Fett, you look at both and you're like, what's that guy's deal?

622
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:11,269
Rym: I don't know, but he's a bad ass and you don't see him lose until you see him lose.

623
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:19,770
Scott: I think, Oh, you know who has another perfect example of this character in Hajime no Ippo, right?

624
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,689
Scott: There's a what's his name?

625
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,310
Rym: Oh, the fricking, uh, I have not seen a lot of that show.

626
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,329
Scott: Takamura who's basically like the, the world champion guy.

627
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:33,930
Scott: He's just incredibly, ridiculously powerful.

628
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:36,089
Scott: He punches the bear.

629
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:37,870
Rym: Oh, the bear punching guy.

630
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:38,703
Rym: I know who that is.

631
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,719
Scott: He's basically, that is like the perfect example of ridiculously powerful, you know, best character guy.

632
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:53,065
Scott: You know, he's sort of a mix between Bunta and, um, from sanctuary, Mr.

633
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,670
Scott: Um, Tokai, yes.

634
00:36:57,294 --> 00:36:59,049
Scott: Sort of a combination of those two.

635
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,730
Rym: Sanctuary is a problem because everyone is that guy.

636
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:07,850
Rym: If you ignore the main characters, everyone is that guy.

637
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,329
Rym: And the main characters are just better than them.

638
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,310
Rym: The end, the good guys are that way.

639
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,709
Rym: The bad guys are that way.

640
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:16,349
Rym: Every character is that way.

641
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:25,094
Rym: Every side character is that way, except for background, normal people, maybe that's why I like sanctuary so much.

642
00:37:25,135 --> 00:37:28,770
Rym: sanctuary is just nothing but Boba Fett.

643
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:29,889
Scott: It's written by the same.

644
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:32,910
Rym: It's Boba Fett and Boba Fett fighting against Boba Fett.

645
00:37:33,314 --> 00:37:34,667
Rym: That's what that manga is.

646
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,850
Scott: I mean, it's written by the same guys who wrote Fist of the North Star, right?

647
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,450
Scott: Which has the same situation where everyone is a total badass.

648
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,749
Rym: It's all about Bronson.

649
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,650
Scott: That's right.

650
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,088
Scott: Okay.

651
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,770
Scott: Anyway, uh, do you have anything else to say about this?

652
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,890
Rym: Well, I'm going through anime that I have watched and they're not that common either.

653
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:59,047
Rym: The more I really think about it, I mean, like Cowboy Bebop does not have a character like that.

654
00:37:59,333 --> 00:37:59,485
Rym: Really?

655
00:37:59,770 --> 00:37:59,866
Scott: Nope.

656
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:02,189
Scott: What the native American guy?

657
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:02,810
Scott: Yeah.

658
00:38:03,418 --> 00:38:04,110
Rym: But he's not bad.

659
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,270
Scott: You don't see him doing it.

660
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,730
Scott: He has the sensei part, but not the badass part.

661
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,161
Scott: Yeah.

662
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:21,250
Rym: There's a lot of characters that have an aspect of this, but these two kinds of badasses, there's the young badass who makes the impossible possible and probably dies and you feel really bad because they're young and invincible.

663
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,290
Rym: And then there's the old invincible.

664
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:24,730
Scott: Yep.

665
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,225
Scott: Madoka doesn't really have such a character at all.

666
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:38,629
Rym: You could argue almost that a Homer follows that purpose of the consummate badass, but the show is partially, the show is too good.

667
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:45,309
Rym: And also does notice how the best shows don't have characters that fall perfectly into all these stereotypes.

668
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,450
Rym: Madoka has the trappings.

669
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:53,974
Scott: This is a character that you see in the formulaic, you know, the, the anime formulas, the quality stand out.

670
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:56,750
Rym: anime is a formulaic show.

671
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:02,988
Rym: And in El Hazzard, there is Fujisawa, who is that kind of character that we're talking about.

672
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,469
Rym: Madoka is too complex.

673
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:10,170
Rym: It has all the trappings of a formulaic show, but doesn't actually follow any of those formulas.

674
00:39:10,512 --> 00:39:13,330
Rym: And every character is a mold breaker in one way or another.

675
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,469
Rym: Every single one of them.

676
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:15,448
Scott: How about slayers?

677
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,137
Rym: Slayers.

678
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:19,389
Scott: Not really.

679
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,081
Scott: Yeah.

680
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:24,516
Scott: I mean, you can go with the rock face dude, but not really lean is more powerful than he is.

681
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,289
Scott: And he's not really a mentor or anything.

682
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,150
Rym: Plus that's a show about a team of people.

683
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:32,748
Rym: They're all basically the main characters and the enemies are way more badass than them until the end.

684
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:33,146
Rym: Yeah.

685
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:33,906
Scott: What a rezo.

686
00:39:35,192 --> 00:39:38,449
Rym: Well, rezo is my favorite villain ever.

687
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,429
Scott: You know, and Trigun doesn't have such a character though.

688
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:46,590
Rym: Though I think Wolfwood almost fits into the stereotype of the Hughes type.

689
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,190
Scott: But he's not.

690
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:47,490
Scott: Yeah.

691
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,550
Scott: But he's not as strong.

692
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:53,270
Scott: He doesn't have that aspect of being so super powerful more than everyone else.

693
00:39:53,290 --> 00:40:02,010
Rym: He has the aspect that notice how fans seem way more invested in Wolfwood and talk about him more than they talk about Vash.

694
00:40:02,511 --> 00:40:03,150
Scott: Quite possibly.

695
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:03,508
Scott: Yes.

696
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,670
Rym: That's purely anecdotal.

697
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:05,869
Rym: But that's, that's what I've seen.

698
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:09,209
Rym: I mean, Monster doesn't really have anything like this.

699
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:17,905
Scott: Monster is not that kind of formula, but 20th century boys does have a, what's his face, the Shogun, Ocho the Shogun.

700
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,167
Scott: He's basically the badass guy.

701
00:40:21,531 --> 00:40:26,728
Rym: So whenever you're watching anime, just think about the characters that fit into that particular stereotype.

702
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,950
Rym: The side character, the King Cosmo, that's not super important to the plot.

703
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:33,769
Rym: They're not the main movers and shakers, but they're there.

704
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:39,470
Rym: They affect things and everyone just seems to always be like, yeah, that's the best character.

705
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:41,009
Rym: That's my favorite character.

706
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,169
Rym: Everyone's always obsessed with the side character, even more so than the main character.

707
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,850
Rym: And if they think that way, pretty much always Bunta, or Boba Fett.

708
00:40:56,281 --> 00:40:58,400
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

709
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:03,519
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.

710
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,940
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

711
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,880
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

712
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,620
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

713
00:41:16,981 --> 00:41:20,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

714
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,400
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

715
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,560
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
