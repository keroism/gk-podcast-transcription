1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,888
Rym: It's Tuesday, February 19th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,049
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:14,180
Scott: I'm tired.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,885
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:20,339
Rym: Tonight, Rome demands a review of Glory to Rome.

6
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,397
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,519
Rym: What, you don't like my long openers?

8
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:30,772
Scott: The opener is supposed to be a title, right?

9
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:34,011
Scott: This is the thing we actually... I shouldn't... I guess...

10
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,148
Rym: What do you mean?

11
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:36,712
Rym: you shouldn't talk?

12
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:37,780
Rym: Is this a GeekNights secret?

13
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:38,827
Scott: Well, no.

14
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:45,739
Scott: You know how some people, when they write articles, will have ridiculously long titles that have way too much in them?

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,615
Rym: Why learn to stop worrying and love the bomb?

16
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:49,220
Rym: That kind of thing?

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,602
Rym: Well, no.

18
00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:50,389
Scott: That's a good title.

19
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,299
Scott: I'm talking about... Let's say there's a movie coming out, right?

20
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,414
Scott: The headline should be...

21
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:58,859
Rym: The boy who went up the mountain and came down a man?

22
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:00,486
Scott: New movie in theaters.

23
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:03,220
Scott: New movie title in theaters this Friday.

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,159
Scott: That's a great... Perfect, right?

25
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:14,599
Scott: A bad headline would be like, "So-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so, star in action flick, so in such-and-such, being released on...".

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,020
Scott: Because that's way too fucking long.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
Rym: That depends on what you're doing.

28
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:23,900
Scott: A lot of that information belongs in the opening paragraph, surely.

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,026
Scott: In fact, all of it does.

30
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:27,680
Scott: But not in the headline, the title.

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,580
Rym: But the headline of GeekNights is whatever people see in iTunes.

32
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:36,500
Scott: You just need to name the title, and the rest goes in paragraph one.

33
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,123
Rym: I don't know.

34
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:37,488
Rym: I prefer...

35
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:38,380
Scott: The title should have less.

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,506
Rym: I prefer drawing it out.

37
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:41,419
Rym: "In a world where Rym and Scott review fidget

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:41,540
Rym: games.".

39
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,968
Scott: That's not the title.

40
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:44,840
Scott: That is the tagline.

41
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,558
Rym: Which we use there, because the title is in the ID3.

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,054
Scott: No, the title has to be short.

43
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:53,780
Scott: You would never... You would be fired if you were the newspaper headline writer.

44
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,520
Rym: Or I'd be the best newspaper headline writer in the world.

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,800
Scott: No, you'd be fired because it wouldn't fit in the fucking newspaper cover.

46
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,959
Rym: It would fit just fine because newspapers are digital.

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,619
Scott: Most of those motherfucker front-pagers are two words.

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,259
Rym: I was very proud of my tweet the other day that basically was talking about newspapers.

49
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,359
Rym: Reader's Digest is like a printed...

50
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Scott: That's not a newspaper.

51
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:12,720
Scott: That's not a newspaper.

52
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,965
Rym: It's a print media.

53
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:16,460
Rym: In fact, it's periodicals, which are doing worse than newspapers.

54
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,058
Scott: Yeah, they are.

55
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,634
Rym: Yeah, because I guess I have a periodical.

56
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:20,440
Rym: It's called Slash Shot.

57
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,940
Rym: It updates every five minutes.

58
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:25,900
Rym: And that's the slow one for old people on the internet.

59
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:26,676
Scott: It sure is.

60
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:34,760
Rym: So, I've been playing a lot of a game that I couldn't play when you were first playing it, but Super Hexagon at some point came to Android.

61
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:35,780
Rym: Oh, okay.

62
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:38,138
Rym: I started playing that and after about... How good are you?

63
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,320
Rym: After about three days, I can consistently get to about 35 seconds on Hexagon.

64
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:43,499
Scott: Oh, so you suck.

65
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,540
Rym: I can get to about 25 seconds on Hexagoner.

66
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,097
Scott: Yeah, you got nothing.

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,400
Rym: And I can get to about seven seconds on Hexagonist.

68
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:50,300
Scott: About the same.

69
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:52,660
Rym: That's what I get for about three days of playing this game.

70
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,759
Scott: I think I've actually unlocked Hexagonister, the hardest one.

71
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:58,865
Rym: Hexagonister?

72
00:02:58,906 --> 00:02:59,980
Rym: It sounds like Zormalgooster.

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,146
Scott: It is, basically.

74
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:01,448
Scott: I don't know.

75
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,455
Scott: I forget what my scores are.

76
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:03,180
Scott: I have to look again.

77
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:05,400
Scott: I haven't played that in weeks, months.

78
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:07,126
Rym: Well, it's pretty fun.

79
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:10,120
Rym: The one problem is you can't really play it on a moving subway unless you sit down.

80
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,510
Rym: So, that's the only time I play it.

81
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,415
Rym: So, I feel like my 30 seconds...

82
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,100
Scott: You've got to just play it before bed or something just once while you're still...

83
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,889
Rym: My 30 seconds I got.

84
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:22,060
Rym: Like, the first, like, when I got to Triangle.

85
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:27,640
Rym: I was actually walking off of the end train as I was in the middle of it.

86
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,674
Rym: I was, like, in the middle of this smooth run.

87
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:30,078
Rym: I'm like, "Oh,

88
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:30,340
Rym: fuck!".

89
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,579
Rym: And I just kind of walked and kept doing it and then I died.

90
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:41,000
Scott: Rewind to a very old episode of GeekNights where I talk about trying to play a DS trauma center surgery game.

91
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,320
Rym: I was going to say, I remember you playing trauma center.

92
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,195
Scott: On Metro North, right?

93
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:45,660
Scott: Train.

94
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,258
Rym: Yeah, subway is easily ten times less stable.

95
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,826
Scott: That's sitting on a train.

96
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:52,433
Scott: You're standing on a subway.

97
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:53,820
Scott: It's, like, whoa, way harder.

98
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,939
Rym: Yeah, it's not like you can sit either.

99
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,421
Rym: So, news.

100
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:08,620
Rym: A while ago, you know, I upgraded... Well, Emily upgraded her video card from a card so old it uses the old nomenclature to 260.

101
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,720
Rym: And then we just bought her a 660 because she's doing video and audio and all this kind of stuff.

102
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:14,187
Rym: And, you know, rendering.

103
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:16,200
Rym: It's a good thing to have a good video card.

104
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:22,660
Rym: So, I'm still rocking my 260, which for gaming is fine, because I'm not really playing any super new games.

105
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,439
Scott: But for penis measuring, sucks.

106
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,200
Rym: Also, can't use that for hardware rendering of effects in Premiere.

107
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,500
Scott: Let me tell you, once that Premiere GPU thing activated, it's like every video just, like, load instantly, play instantly.

108
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,220
Scott: I didn't have to much enter and wait for things to render.

109
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,060
Scott: You know what I really need it for?

110
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:45,040
Rym: So, the main trouble I have is, let's say, I'm doing ghetto camera angles.

111
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Rym: So, I got three cameras and by zooming into different parts of the frame, I have, say, nine camera angles of us in a panel.

112
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:59,620
Rym: All right, so now I got nine HD streams and I want to watch them all simultaneously and live camera angles while I watch the whole thing.

113
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:01,779
Rym: Yeah, can't do that.

114
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:12,280
Rym: So, the way I did it last time is I only showed two of those streams and I just noted which black box was which and just kind of fuck it.

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,471
Rym: It worked okay, but the only reason I haven't bought a 680 yet is because I was waiting for this time.

116
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:25,000
Rym: right now when NVIDIA starts to announce the next round of video cards and all the older ones get a little bit cheaper.

117
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,280
Scott: I think the 780 is still a ways out.

118
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:34,740
Rym: Oh no, it is, but they announced early because I actually didn't expect them to announce the 7XX series until March.

119
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,840
Scott: Probably, maybe even, who knows, a while.

120
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,774
Scott: Maybe, I was guessing March.

121
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:38,860
Scott: It's got a while.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,380
Rym: But I wasn't paying attention to NVIDIA and out of nowhere, they announced the GTX Titan is going to be available to consumers.

123
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:49,900
Scott: I don't think this is going to change the price of the 680.

124
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,000
Rym: Well, it didn't as of today.

125
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,659
Scott: I don't think it's going to because it's not.

126
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:03,880
Rym: What's interesting is that there are numerous accounts that it performs right now about as well for like dollars per unit of power as the 690.

127
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:14,440
Scott: Right, well here's what I think happened, right, is basically they realized, hey, the X90s, right, all of those people don't know, like 690, 590.

128
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,580
Rym: It's just an overclock 80.

129
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,919
Scott: It's just the 81, crazy overclock.

130
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,260
Rym: Well, kind of like how the 70 is usually just, it's been in, it's one that just kind of sucks.

131
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,680
Scott: They pick up the price like by double and they overclock it.

132
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,800
Scott: It's the same thing as the Intel Extreme series.

133
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,577
Scott: It's the same i7 that I have, only they overclock it ridiculously and put their guarantee on it that it won't break and they charge $1,000 for it.

134
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,380
Rym: If I was going to give you generic advice, get an X60 if you're just playing games.

135
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,200
Rym: Get an X80 if you're also doing video editing.

136
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,760
Scott: I would get an X80 if you need it for anything and you can afford it because the 80 is always the best.

137
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,109
Rym: The X60 was like $250 cheaper though.

138
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,808
Scott: It's a lot cheaper, yeah.

139
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,058
Scott: That's why I said, if you can afford it.

140
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,833
Scott: And let me tell you, now that I got the 680, I can play NS2 at max settings at 1900 by 1200 resolution.

141
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:06,520
Rym: I'll bet the 660 can do the same thing for NS2.

142
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,240
Scott: At 60 frames a second while recording it with FRAPS at 60 frames a second and I never lose a frame.

143
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,239
Rym: Yeah, Fred, the bottleneck on FRAPS is disk I/O.

144
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,499
Scott: With a non-SSD I'm recording to.

145
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:20,800
Scott: And full frames.

146
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:31,060
Rym: Anyway, the deal with the Titan is that it was used in this big supercomputer and it's kind of, basically it's the most powerful like consumer video card ever.

147
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,317
Scott: Well, what it is, is basically it's like, hey, the 690 is just an overclock 680, so it's crazy.

148
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,793
Scott: But the Titan is actually like the next generation, but the actual next generation.

149
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:44,620
Scott: to make it affordable for us and normal people is a ways off.

150
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:49,760
Scott: So like, well, we'll just give you the crazy rare supercomputer edition if you really want to.

151
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,860
Scott: It costs the same as the 690 and performs similarly, but it's a lot more.

152
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,480
Rym: It has the CUDA cores like I use for rendering, but the thing is.

153
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:07,200
Scott: It's way more power efficient and makes less heat than the 690 because it's not an overclock 680, it's a regular clocked supercomputer GPU.

154
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:13,880
Rym: It has so many of those CUDA cores, but it's a thousand dollars.

155
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:14,298
Scott: Yep.

156
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:16,840
Rym: Uh, yeah, not going to buy one, but.

157
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,580
Scott: No, no one, unless you are lottery winning this really just buy a 680.

158
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:28,220
Rym: So I read a review from some dude who was like, yeah, so I SLI this motherfucker and I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

159
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,700
Scott: Where did he go?

160
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,240
Scott: That is his only hobby computer.

161
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,698
Rym: This was like reviewer got three of them.

162
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:36,539
Scott: If Nvidia gives me three of them.

163
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:36,977
Scott: Yes.

164
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:37,799
Scott: Sure.

165
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,034
Rym: My electric bill will go up substantially and I'll get 10,000 frames per second.

166
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,839
Rym: And that won't matter.

167
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:44,539
Scott: Fuck it.

168
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,780
Scott: I'll take it for free.

169
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:46,685
Rym: It's got 2,688 cores.

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,396
Scott: I'll take it.

171
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:49,730
Scott: I'll run.

172
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,180
Rym: I'll do Bitcoin.

173
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,299
Rym: And another 900 double precision cars.

174
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,080
Scott: If someone gave me those fuckers for free, Bitcoin city, Bitcoin and a folding at home.

175
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:02,280
Rym: It has as much RAM as my current computer had when I built it.

176
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:03,039
Rym: Six gigs.

177
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,639
Rym: Only six gigs actually.

178
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:23,392
Rym: Anyway, uh, I'm hoping because someone from Nvidia, I can't super verify this or take it with a grain of salt, but I read a report that someone in video said that this series of cards, well, chips is if pretty much across the board, going to be faster than the seven X, X series of cards,

179
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:24,280
Scott: probably.

180
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:27,280
Rym: And that, I don't know if this means they're going to spend a thousand.

181
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,500
Scott: I mean the six nineties more powerful than anything.

182
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,000
Rym: So why wouldn't be, these aren't going to replace the quadros.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,960
Rym: So I wonder where these fit in their product line.

184
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,831
Scott: Are these going to be like the crazy type in 700 series for crazy rich people.

185
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,895
Rym: But what's the difference between this and the 700 series?

186
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,776
Rym: Cause if this is priced at a thousand dollars, what are they going to price the seven 80 at?

187
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,149
Scott: If it's just worse, the seven 80 will be $500 probably just like the six 80 was.

188
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,339
Scott: seven 90 will probably be 900 to a thousand dollars.

189
00:09:56,661 --> 00:10:03,320
Rym: But the thing is, if the performance is that much different and these are more expensive, one is better.

190
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:03,720
Scott: Sure.

191
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:07,479
Rym: But now they've broken their model of now they're going to have, they're going to have more tears.

192
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,117
Scott: What do you mean?

193
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:09,459
Scott: So why do you mean they broke it?

194
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:09,811
Rym: No, no.

195
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,960
Rym: So the model they, they have, they're sort of like, they have their high end, like render whatever GPUs, right?

196
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:17,360
Scott: They're professionals.

197
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,439
Rym: They're GTX four or five, six, seven.

198
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:19,880
Rym: Right.

199
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,780
Rym: Now they're going to in parallel to both of those have the Titan series, right?

200
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,700
Scott: For the crazy rich people.

201
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,920
Scott: How is that broken?

202
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:31,601
Rym: It just seems weird that the ma that one of these will be about the same price point as the X 90.

203
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:37,679
Rym: And if the seven hundreds are less, if the 700 like the seven 60 is, well, the seven 80, let's say is slower than this.

204
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,940
Scott: Of course it's going to be slower.

205
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,603
Scott: I wouldn't it be.

206
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,473
Scott: the seven 80 is going to be like $200.

207
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:42,860
Scott: of course it's gotta be slower.

208
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,300
Rym: I don't think the seven 80 is going to be $200 and I think it'd be five or 600.

209
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,724
Scott: You said seven 60 and I said seven 80 and so did you, the seven 80 is going to be $500.

210
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:52,660
Scott: That makes perfect sense.

211
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,733
Scott: Of course it should be slower than the thousand dollars.

212
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:55,739
Scott: CPU GPU.

213
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,324
Scott: Duh.

214
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,345
Rym: Yeah.

215
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:58,720
Rym: But where does this fit in the tear?

216
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,260
Rym: Are they going to number these the same way?

217
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,929
Rym: It'll be, it will be like seven, 67, seven, 70, 80 Titan.

218
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:05,040
Rym: Are they going to be the eight?

219
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:07,519
Scott: No, the Titan isn't even numbered with a, with a seven.

220
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,640
Rym: How are they?

221
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,960
Rym: Are they going to number with something?

222
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,060
Scott: Are they going to be curious what the fucking number is?

223
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,580
Scott: The numbers that don't even make sense anyway.

224
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,760
Rym: Well, actually they kind of do make sense.

225
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,440
Scott: Like you just, the Titan is a thing that anyone can ignore because they are, anyone listening to this is not stupid.

226
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:23,160
Scott: Just money coming out their butt.

227
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:25,600
Rym: The thing is, so how about this?

228
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,419
Scott: If you want a lottery, you can buy one of these fuckers.

229
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:35,739
Rym: There any reason on God's green earth to buy a seven 90 or a six 90 let's say a six 90 instead of this, if they're comparable in price.

230
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,220
Scott: No, you should.

231
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,560
Scott: The nineties become stupid.

232
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:38,853
Scott: Yeah.

233
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:46,900
Scott: Because if you're going to buy a 90 right, if it's about the same price as the Titan, then get the Titan cause it makes less heat and use like less electricity.

234
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,101
Scott: I guess

235
00:11:47,121 --> 00:12:08,619
Rym: the reason I'm not concerned as I'm curious is because there's been a trend over time with the naming of processors and components of computers to use the numbers to obfuscate the reality of the binning while simultaneously to confuse consumers and make certain cards or things appear to be better values than they actually are.

236
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,420
Scott: Here's the reason why it's pretty simple, right?

237
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:12,760
Scott: Somebody could come out of nowhere, right?

238
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:18,159
Scott: Like Intel or Nvidia or AMD or whoever, and just start naming things one, two, three.

239
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,480
Rym: But then, and then the, their competitor will come out and say, yeah, well, here's the nine.

240
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,000
Scott: No, here's the reason why that doesn't work.

241
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,220
Scott: The reason why is because that simple numbering, right?

242
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,660
Scott: Is nobody who would need that simple numbering is a person who ever buys chips or GPS.

243
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:44,040
Scott: Anyone who, you know, anyone that marketing would work on is someone who just buys a full computer and doesn't even know what parts are in it, right?

244
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,659
Scott: The only people buying computer parts are nerds like us and complicated numbering systems work better to market to crazy nerds.

245
00:12:51,841 --> 00:13:04,140
Rym: Ah, but they, I think they only do so partly because especially, I remember there's an era of Intel chips and the separate era of AMD chips where they'd have like a series like a 600, 700, something like that, but then they'd have fifties in between.

246
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:12,560
Rym: But the fit, there was no correlation between like five 56, 57, 50 and 500, 600, 700.

247
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,940
Rym: They were like this middle tier with weird amounts of cash and things, and it was unclear from benchmarks and the prices were all over the place.

248
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:27,539
Rym: And I think it's just to be able to effectively capture prices from a wide demographic of people with varying levels of technical skills and research abilities.

249
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:29,760
Rym: I'm not saying that's news.

250
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,178
Rym: It's just, I've always found it really annoying.

251
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:32,378
Scott: What do you get?

252
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:34,758
Scott: It's a reality of bidding, as you said, not bolt.

253
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:45,357
Rym: Now the reality that's the reality of bidding coupled with a crass desire to do maximal price discovery against your, uh, well, I mean, you got all these chips, they're binned, right?

254
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:57,020
Scott: If you didn't do this sort of weird numbering thing that everyone, you know, that everyone would sort of pick, you know, one slot and then basically all the other bins wouldn't sell and the prices on them would drop.

255
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,300
Scott: So basically you obfuscate so that you can sell, you know, that's what I'm saying.

256
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,660
Scott: Each bin sells in accordance with its quantity.

257
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,100
Scott: You've got a lot in a, you got to lower the price on being a, to sell more of those.

258
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,039
Rym: That's exactly what I said.

259
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:18,820
Rym: You obfuscate your pricing by having these weird model numbers in order to do maximal price discovery against the majority of your customers.

260
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,999
Scott: Very few people are going to figure like bin C would be empty because everyone bought them all and a, B and D would be full.

261
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,779
Scott: And you'd be like, fuck, I didn't sell any of these.

262
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:28,378
Scott: Yeah.

263
00:14:29,163 --> 00:14:29,877
Scott: What do I do now?

264
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:34,796
Scott: And then they get to lower the price in them so much to sell them that everyone's ripping your ass off.

265
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:37,538
Scott: Yeah, and that's it.

266
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:40,039
Rym: All I said was it's always kind of annoyed me.

267
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,390
Rym: I didn't know what I knew about it.

268
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:46,099
Scott: I didn't even propose doing anything about it the way it's got to be.

269
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:49,099
Rym: I could partly I bring it up because a lot of people don't realize it.

270
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,879
Rym: A lot of people don't.

271
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:57,840
Scott: And you know what the fact is, is it's not even that big a deal because most of the chips aren't even sold directly to the customers that are seeing that marketing.

272
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,560
Scott: They're being sold to like Dell buys a zillion of them.

273
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:01,299
Scott: Well, here's an example.

274
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,620
Rym: Recently I've had several friends be like, hey, I'm going to build a new computer.

275
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,405
Rym: How does this build look?

276
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:09,158
Rym: Or they'd be like, they'd show me two CPUs, two Intel CPUs, two I fives.

277
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:12,058
Rym: They're priced about the same.

278
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:13,283
Rym: They're wildly.

279
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:17,400
Rym: they have different speeds and caches and number and product numbers.

280
00:15:17,943 --> 00:15:19,899
Rym: And it's not clear the difference between them.

281
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:26,000
Scott: Probably if they bought either one, odds are they wouldn't notice a difference in their everyday work anyway.

282
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:30,501
Scott: Probably they would never, they would never know which one would have been better for them.

283
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:37,080
Scott: If it saved them a microsecond here or there, they would never notice and have no effect in their lives, probably one of them is broken.

284
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:48,580
Rym: So what that could cause, remember that TED talk way back where the guy was like, if you pick between two pairs of jeans, you're going to be happy no matter what you pick between a thousand, you're going to be unhappy no matter what, even if you got better genes objectively.

285
00:15:49,402 --> 00:16:06,762
Rym: I think all of this together contributes probably not necessarily by design, but just in practice to the weird upgrade cycle where people are into computers upgrade more often than they need to, even when they can't themselves articulate the actual difference.

286
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:09,960
Scott: because they had so many choices, they felt bad about the one they got.

287
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,443
Rym: Yup.

288
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:11,452
Scott: You know, I do.

289
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:14,159
Rym: I decide which processor to buy.

290
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:18,964
Rym: I just list all of them in order by price and I decide how much money I'm willing to spend.

291
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:20,540
Rym: And I look at what's there.

292
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:24,260
Rym: The only other thing I do is look to see if there's a plateau that I didn't notice.

293
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,243
Scott: I buy the one with the most golden eggs and the one with the most trophies next to it on Newegg.

294
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:29,952
Rym: Ah, but what if one just came out?

295
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:31,661
Rym: that's better but hasn't gotten anything yet?

296
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:35,545
Scott: Because you can tell by looking at it, if that's like the hot new one that's got the most eggs.

297
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:36,960
Rym: Well, yeah, because all the nerds buy it immediately.

298
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,049
Scott: Yeah, you know what you want.

299
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:39,119
Rym: Anyway, you got any news?

300
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,480
Scott: I do have a news that I'm trying to remember.

301
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:45,420
Rym: I think you want to talk about valve steam.

302
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:46,424
Scott: Oh, yeah.

303
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,060
Scott: So steam Linux, which I think we've talked about before a zillion times.

304
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,462
Scott: Right.

305
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:51,659
Rym: We've scoffed and laughed.

306
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,684
Scott: Well, I mean, in ancient history, we've talked about, man, if only steam would come out on Linux, I can't.

307
00:16:55,804 --> 00:17:00,165
Rym: I got to switch back to back when I'm back with Linux was my primary operating system.

308
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:08,180
Scott: I got to switch back to Windows because the no games on Linux, you know, and then I used to do GeekNights in Linux and reboot to play Counter-Strike.

309
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:12,380
Scott: And then we talked about how, you know, more recently it was in beta.

310
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:13,539
Scott: Well, now it's out out.

311
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:17,300
Scott: You can get steam for Linux for reals and they put a sale on Linux games.

312
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:20,700
Scott: And of course, there's not too many Linux games that you can get.

313
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,550
Scott: There's just a few.

314
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:21,896
Scott: Come on.

315
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,740
Rym: They got a serious Sam three half life and Counter-Strike source.

316
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:28,277
Rym: OK, not go.

317
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:29,225
Rym: All right.

318
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,439
Scott: Who go will be there soon enough?

319
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,200
Scott: Well, see, all the valve games will be there, which is, I guess, cool, right?

320
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:40,103
Scott: And if they got dota to that because that's one of their games as well, that would be pretty big.

321
00:17:40,203 --> 00:17:43,480
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, NS two is not on there.

322
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:51,898
Scott: In fact, you know what event is to actually came out on Linux and it worked just as well as the windows one for reals.

323
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:57,701
Scott: And there was a fraps for Linux that worked as well as fraps on windows and such and such.

324
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:01,520
Scott: I'm not really playing too many other games right now.

325
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,859
Scott: I probably could switch.

326
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:10,500
Scott: So you say that, but I but I have a giant library of thousands of dollars of steam games, most of which will never run on Linux ever.

327
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:14,964
Rym: I did switch to Linux for a long time and I went back because, yeah, I couldn't play it in my fucking game.

328
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:19,485
Scott: That's like if I didn't care about games, I'd probably use Linux and nothing but Linux.

329
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:21,740
Rym: I'm really doubling down on the Counter-Strike.

330
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,651
Scott: It's really just an escape hatch for valve.

331
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:30,380
Scott: in case, you know, I mean, I could see right by the time Windows nine, Windows 10 comes along right.

332
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:35,218
Scott: Ten, fifteen years from now, it's like, well, Windows is pretty much dead.

333
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,900
Scott: You know, desktop PCs are dead for most people, right?

334
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:46,199
Scott: It's pretty much anyone who does have a desktop PC, it's going to be Linux in, you know, that far out from now.

335
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,460
Scott: And most people just use tablets and nothing now there.

336
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,359
Scott: Who knows wearable devices and such?

337
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:51,781
Scott: Who knows?

338
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:58,280
Scott: So it's really, hey, in order to keep making PC games, they need a PC platform and a Windows disappears.

339
00:18:59,003 --> 00:18:59,567
Scott: You need this.

340
00:18:59,587 --> 00:18:59,769
Rym: Yeah.

341
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:01,100
Rym: So it's good to do the groundwork now.

342
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:07,453
Rym: And also it lets them get the expertise they would need to be able to pretty much straight up make a steam console.

343
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:08,179
Rym: that actually was good.

344
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,561
Scott: Yeah.

345
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:16,340
Scott: And it could also significantly just help the development of Linux itself to get all, you know, more users, more focus on certain things.

346
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,966
Rym: Maybe for the audio, the audio that works, my God, audio that works, get some fucking audio that works.

347
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:22,439
Rym: It doesn't fucking work in Linux.

348
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:22,904
Scott: Yeah.

349
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,240
Scott: What if my game has surround sound?

350
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,560
Scott: I want to port it to Linux steam.

351
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,840
Scott: You better make that fucking surround sound.

352
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:29,060
Scott: So I can hear the skulks come from behind.

353
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,682
Scott: They just got.

354
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:35,860
Rym: even if every game on steam were on Linux with perfect performance and audio and video worked fine.

355
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,299
Rym: You know what I still couldn't do on Linux?

356
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:38,638
Rym: Make GeekNights.

357
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,825
Scott: That's not my problem.

358
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:53,179
Scott: But the thing is, right, if the other desktop OS is, you know, evaporate, even Adobe would be forced to put all this stuff on Linux if it could, which may be very difficult for them.

359
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:56,760
Scott: I'm sure they were able to get it on OS X and Windows.

360
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,767
Scott: I'm sure they could also.

361
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,360
Rym: I'm sure they have a similar escape.

362
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,380
Scott: Yeah, they can do it if they really needed to.

363
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,760
Scott: They've actually been doing really well lately.

364
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,267
Scott: I'm thinking right.

365
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:05,974
Scott: like when do they often do?

366
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,504
Scott: they come out with the new windows or Windows?

367
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:08,900
Scott: seven came out in seven.

368
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:09,888
Scott: Right.

369
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:10,660
Scott: Is that correct?

370
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:11,425
Rym: I don't remember.

371
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:13,419
Scott: I remember whatever it came out.

372
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,358
Scott: Oh, ten, maybe.

373
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:15,050
Rym: Oh, ten.

374
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,519
Scott: But I forget when it came out.

375
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,720
Scott: But, you know, ten, ten by twenty thirty.

376
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:29,220
Rym: Who knows if desktop PCs or be, you know, you could have said the year twenty five, twenty five, but you didn't.

377
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,907
Rym: You said twenty thirty.

378
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:30,920
Scott: That's farther away.

379
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,543
Scott: Yeah.

380
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:34,619
Scott: By then, for sure, nothing that we know will be.

381
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,917
Rym: Well, they had like Windows 11 and the PS5.

382
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:38,610
Scott: How old will be?

383
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,379
Scott: Like 70 something.

384
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:43,340
Rym: In the year twenty five, twenty five, we will be long dead.

385
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:46,359
Rym: Are you sure you will be long dead?

386
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,401
Scott: Will I?

387
00:20:53,811 --> 00:21:05,639
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, someone and by someone, I mean the LOTR project took Tolkien's main works, Return of the King, Fellowship of the Ring, The Hobbit, Two Towers, Silmarillion.

388
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:09,920
Scott: And they just did a huge big data data analysis thingy.

389
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,703
Rym: That's pretty cool.

390
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:15,780
Rym: You can just kind of fuck around with, you know, how often the different characters co-occur with one another.

391
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,820
Rym: What is the average sentiment per sentence across the books?

392
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,260
Rym: What are the most commonly used unique words in each of the books?

393
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:26,059
Rym: It's you could click around in here forever.

394
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,720
Rym: It's just there's weird stuff.

395
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,540
Rym: Like you'll look at this graph of like character co-occurrence.

396
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,539
Rym: You're like, what's that dot all the way out over there?

397
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:34,020
Rym: Oh, it's some hobbit.

398
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,160
Rym: Well, he knows this other hobbit.

399
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:36,580
Rym: You can just go down this chain forever.

400
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:38,519
Rym: It's actually pretty cool.

401
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:48,080
Rym: And apparently the most common words in the Return of the King are came shell Pippin far long, dark, Aragorn looked come men great away.

402
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:51,660
Rym: Lord Mary King went Frodo like Gandalf Sam.

403
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:53,359
Scott: That sounds about right.

404
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:58,720
Rym: Yeah, the hobbit is like Bilbo Thorin Mountain.

405
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:00,138
Scott: It's about right.

406
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:03,040
Scott: All right.

407
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,800
Scott: So I have not been to as many concerts as some people have in their lives.

408
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,860
Scott: It's not my number one thing or close to it.

409
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,179
Scott: But I have been to quite a few in my day, you know, more than some.

410
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:18,360
Scott: And it is a common thing at concerts in the United States that no one sits in chairs.

411
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,440
Scott: Everyone stands and people get pretty close.

412
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,453
Scott: They pack it in.

413
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:21,960
Scott: Right.

414
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:31,360
Scott: And if it's a metal concert or a rock concert, there may be moshing, dancing, rocking, head, banging, cheering, jumping, all kinds of stage diving activities.

415
00:22:32,322 --> 00:22:35,700
Scott: One activity that does not happen, especially at the arena concerts.

416
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:36,162
Scott: Right.

417
00:22:36,202 --> 00:22:39,614
Scott: But even at the small concerts is the on stage getting.

418
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,220
Scott: you do not get on the stage.

419
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:44,480
Scott: There are usually three or four large people at the front.

420
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,096
Rym: I pulled it off once in my entire life with the yes.

421
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:51,019
Rym: Yeah, I forgot her name, too.

422
00:22:51,783 --> 00:22:52,932
Rym: Anyway, I will look her up.

423
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:53,980
Rym: Vana, I think.

424
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:54,844
Scott: Yep.

425
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,220
Scott: Anyway, from Croatia.

426
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:57,084
Rym: Yeah.

427
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,959
Scott: If you try to get on stage, they will stop you.

428
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:04,059
Scott: If you stage dive to the front, they'll just grab you and push you back into the crowd.

429
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:11,443
Rym: How if the if the talent tries to pull you up, usually the bouncers will be like, hell, no, that's right.

430
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:19,560
Scott: Insurance motherfuckers, if you do manage to miraculously get on the stage, they will come on and tackle you and, you know, pull you away.

431
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:19,862
Scott: Right.

432
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:22,860
Scott: Because, you know, maybe you're trying to stab the performers.

433
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,602
Scott: They don't fucking know.

434
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:23,963
Scott: Right.

435
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:31,600
Scott: However, here's a video on YouTube from a guy who got on stage with Steel Panther somehow.

436
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:32,262
Scott: Right.

437
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:35,719
Scott: He's up there with Steel Panther and security's not going after him.

438
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:40,622
Scott: I don't know what's up for the first few seconds because they don't show how the hell he got up there.

439
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:45,720
Scott: And then the guy in Steel Panther is the only one you can hear.

440
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,700
Scott: You can't hear this guy talking because he has no microphone.

441
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,060
Scott: Right.

442
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:52,400
Scott: Apparently, he claims he can play all their songs on guitar.

443
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,482
Scott: He asked to borrow the guitarist's guitar and the guitarist is like, you're fucking full of shit.

444
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:02,279
Scott: And they give him the guitar and then holy shit.

445
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:08,957
Scott: All I can say is that the actual guitarist doesn't know what the fuck to do when he doesn't have his guitar.

446
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:15,441
Scott: You got to watch this because this is the kind of thing that will happen never again, ever.

447
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:20,180
Scott: So to know that it did happen, though.

448
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,240
Scott: Please try this, try to do this, if you're not me, go for this, try to do this.

449
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,043
Rym: That's right.

450
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:30,120
Scott: Anyone who is not me needs to try to make this happen at every concert.

451
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:34,220
Scott: I'm not going up against the large security people.

452
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,539
Rym: I think the best would be if you convince the band, like hand you the instrument and then you just fucking suck.

453
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:39,961
Scott: Fuck it.

454
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:43,220
Scott: No, you fucking just throw it in the audience to your friend and then he runs out.

455
00:24:43,602 --> 00:24:43,784
Scott: Yeah.

456
00:24:44,168 --> 00:24:45,360
Rym: Or you just start playing Stairway.

457
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,440
Scott: Like the guy says, he's like, this is my guitar cost two hundred and fifty dollars.

458
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,559
Scott: If you break a string, you are right.

459
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,360
Rym: Anyway, I have a mouthpiece for my trumpet that cost almost two hundred and fifty dollars.

460
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,123
Rym: He was joking.

461
00:24:57,707 --> 00:25:00,200
Scott: I mean, it might have been a $250 guitar, but not likely.

462
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,106
Scott: It was probably more than that.

463
00:25:01,448 --> 00:25:03,020
Scott: Anyway, it could have been like three hundred bucks.

464
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,700
Scott: It's time for something at a moment or thing.

465
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,096
Scott: Oh, it was the thing of the day, wasn't it?

466
00:25:08,177 --> 00:25:08,359
Scott: Yeah.

467
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,147
Scott: I met a moment.

468
00:25:09,187 --> 00:25:10,299
Rym: I was tired.

469
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,124
Scott: I'm tired.

470
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:12,620
Rym: You would like Scott to be less tired.

471
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,119
Scott: Donate money, donate sugar.

472
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:18,678
Scott: If I drank Red Bull, I would do that now, but I don't know.

473
00:25:19,222 --> 00:25:21,360
Rym: Scott, I got to tell you, you wouldn't like Red Bull.

474
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,840
Rym: I know you wouldn't want is carbonated.

475
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,222
Scott: Taste it.

476
00:25:23,303 --> 00:25:24,209
Scott: Oh, I thought it was wasn't.

477
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,800
Scott: I thought it was just like sugary syrup.

478
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,978
Rym: It's lightly carbonated.

479
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:28,351
Rym: No, you would not like.

480
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:29,240
Scott: tasted it before.

481
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,620
Scott: It tastes like cough medicine.

482
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,419
Rym: So you take cough medicine when you're sick?

483
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:34,900
Rym: No, really?

484
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,203
Rym: Never.

485
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:36,460
Rym: Not if you're like sick and coughing.

486
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,060
Rym: The doctors like take some fucking cough medicine.

487
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,027
Scott: When I was a kid, I did.

488
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:40,218
Scott: But now I know it doesn't fucking work.

489
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,097
Rym: True, but that's a separate thing.

490
00:25:43,224 --> 00:25:44,240
Rym: So what what if it did work?

491
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,740
Rym: Because Red Bull does work in terms of not being tired anymore.

492
00:25:48,444 --> 00:25:50,800
Scott: Uh, because it might have some horrible side effects.

493
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,040
Scott: It doesn't like having a heart attack and die.

494
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,380
Rym: No, it's just caffeine and taurine and heart attack, glucose.

495
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,434
Scott: Sure.

496
00:25:58,454 --> 00:25:58,639
Scott: All right.

497
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,631
Scott: So metamoment, metamoment number one, the book club book is The Great Gatsby by F.

498
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:04,119
Rym: Scott Fitzgerald.

499
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,580
Rym: We're going to do a show on it on Thursday.

500
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:06,578
Rym: I hope you've read it.

501
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,680
Rym: If you haven't read it yet, just read it.

502
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,896
Rym: It'll take you like an hour.

503
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:12,360
Scott: Unless you can't read widget case.

504
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,360
Scott: That's a fucking problem.

505
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Scott: It's a short story that is a problem that you have even more reason to read.

506
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:19,759
Scott: You get fucking better at reading illiterate person.

507
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,819
Rym: It's also a pretty good book.

508
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,220
Rym: And the umbrage the young kids took with the book was surprising.

509
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:26,718
Rym: Anyway, I can think of worse books.

510
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,340
Scott: Metamoment number two is a new metamoment, everybody.

511
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:34,300
Scott: I'm going to announce something that was already announced on the Internet.

512
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,999
Rym: Scott, before you announce, I'm going to say one thing.

513
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,037
Rym: It's all you.

514
00:26:37,524 --> 00:26:38,136
Scott: It's all me.

515
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:39,420
Scott: It doesn't matter.

516
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:40,778
Rym: I made the thing clip.

517
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,800
Rym: I already clapped.

518
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:43,238
Scott: OK, I already got this.

519
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,340
Scott: So some talking was going on in the forum.

520
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:50,920
Rym: And I have a shit variety, possibly a shit talk, a shit talk was happening.

521
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,800
Scott: And I realized, hey, this shit talk is actually really easy to do and not shit talk.

522
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:05,280
Scott: So I said, hey, even though I'm doing a whole bunch of stuff like Kinetic Con, still got to do something for Paxos and East and Anime Boston.

523
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,579
Rym: I started writing that one panel.

524
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,800
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to start doing the other one maybe this weekend.

525
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,220
Scott: This will take me like no time at all.

526
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:16,119
Scott: So why the hell not do this instead of shit talking it?

527
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:17,678
Scott: So here's what we're going to do.

528
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,898
Scott: We're already doing it.

529
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,020
Scott: It is the FRC Gaming Grand Prix of twenty thirteen.

530
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,299
Scott: Perhaps it could be the inaugural one.

531
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:28,800
Scott: Perhaps it could be the first annual.

532
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,280
Scott: We'll see if it ever happens again.

533
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,060
Scott: This is an experiment in all senses of at least one of these is happening.

534
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:41,292
Scott: We are going to determine the best in gaming of listeners of GeekNights and Rym.

535
00:27:41,472 --> 00:27:45,639
Rym: also, because I am well, I am technically listening to GeekNights right now.

536
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,785
Scott: I am the soldier.

537
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:52,680
Scott: We are, in fact, listeners, jury game selector and rules maker of this entire thing.

538
00:27:52,860 --> 00:28:01,399
Rym: The fact that when you announce this in the forum, I posted a picture of you as the game master from Hunger Games, and I didn't realize you'd never actually seen the movie.

539
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,169
Scott: Yeah, I read it.

540
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:02,879
Scott: I know what that is.

541
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:03,798
Scott: I just didn't know, you know.

542
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,300
Scott: Anyway, so here's how it works.

543
00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:08,011
Scott: First, you have to join our forum.

544
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:09,099
Scott: if you're not in there already to.

545
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,724
Scott: You need to go to.

546
00:28:09,764 --> 00:28:11,640
Scott: the thread is the top thread number three.

547
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,234
Scott: You need to post in that thread by March 1st.

548
00:28:14,315 --> 00:28:21,208
Scott: that yes, indeed, you are in if you are in your name goes into this public Google doc that only I can edit.

549
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:22,620
Scott: so far, believe it or not.

550
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:28,979
Scott: There are thirty five names on this list of people who are competing for the title of best gamer in FRC.

551
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:34,260
Scott: Then on March 1st, I will announce the game of the first round.

552
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,200
Scott: I have already chosen all four of the rounds, believe it or not.

553
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,864
Rym: Oh, my God.

554
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,980
Rym: The trophy has to be this basketball block.

555
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:44,060
Scott: I think we really only have time for four rounds.

556
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:48,520
Scott: The rules of each round will be decided by me on a round by round basis.

557
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,058
Scott: You will score points.

558
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:56,688
Scott: The top 10 finishers in each round will score championship points, just like an F1 Grand Prix.

559
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:59,360
Scott: after the four, I guess, races.

560
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,420
Scott: Grand Prix's whoever has the most points will win.

561
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,520
Scott: I'll keep adding new rounds if there's ties.

562
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,479
Scott: So we'll guarantee you will not end in a tie.

563
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:15,640
Scott: You I'm going to make sure that every game selected is not a game or rule set that will exclude or disadvantage anyone.

564
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,637
Scott: So I'm not going to pick games, for example, Scott.

565
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:19,699
Rym: I have neither arms nor legs.

566
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:26,820
Scott: Oh, well, you might be disadvantaged, but I'm not going to, for example, pick a game where ping matters because we have international combatants.

567
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:35,339
Scott: I'm not going to pick a game that is expensive and difficult to obtain because international or financially challenged combatants may not be able to compete.

568
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,349
Rym: You're not going to make it.

569
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,200
Scott: I'm not going to choose.

570
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:38,624
Rym: Quick to.

571
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:50,520
Scott: I'm not going to choose and push up a PlayStation three or Xbox 360 or Wii U exclusive game because someone might not have that console and be or even if they did, they might not want to buy that game.

572
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,800
Scott: So every game is going to be something that everyone will be able to play.

573
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:56,520
Scott: There may be multiplayer.

574
00:29:56,883 --> 00:29:58,280
Scott: There may be single player.

575
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:01,379
Scott: There may be all kinds of things going on.

576
00:30:01,822 --> 00:30:07,579
Scott: If you want to prove that you have more gaming skills than other people and maybe tabletop, it may be video.

577
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,239
Scott: It may be who knows what, right?

578
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:11,778
Scott: If you want to prove that you're the best and win.

579
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:19,640
Scott: And with this many entrants, I'm already guaranteeing at least a prize for at least the top finisher, if not more.

580
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:28,060
Scott: It's pretty easy to get trophies made or we could give them the belt or at worst, Amazon gift cards or board games of their choice or who knows what, right?

581
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,960
Rym: They'll get 10 copies of Hellas, something like that.

582
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,479
Scott: Board games I have that I want anymore.

583
00:30:33,403 --> 00:30:35,960
Scott: A pile of comics that's sitting on my floor that I don't want anymore.

584
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,557
Scott: Who knows?

585
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,379
Rym: I got this old Samsung battery sitting here.

586
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:40,050
Scott: Sure.

587
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:40,460
Scott: Right.

588
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,620
Scott: There'll be prizes for whoever is on the podium.

589
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:45,140
Scott: Size of podium has yet to be determined.

590
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:50,500
Scott: But at very least, I guarantee the winner gloating rights.

591
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:57,839
Scott: And in fact, even if you don't win, there are already 35 people that you might be able to gloat over if you're ahead of them, even if you're in second place.

592
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,939
Rym: You just made in the future the dude who's actually in last place feel really bad.

593
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,112
Scott: Oh, this is going to actually every every.

594
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:09,460
Scott: every game is actually going to be a fair test of skill.

595
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,260
Scott: There's not going to be a lot of luck or forgiveness here.

596
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:16,177
Scott: So, yeah, last place should feel bad.

597
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:18,520
Scott: But I am good.

598
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,280
Scott: There's going to be great variety, right?

599
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:25,720
Scott: So even if you're bad at gaming overall, one of these games may be up your alley.

600
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:36,240
Scott: And if you just score pretty much any number of championship points, considering in any round, only a third less than a third of players will get even one point scoring.

601
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,718
Scott: Even a championship point will put you ahead of people.

602
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:40,080
Scott: Right.

603
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:43,700
Scott: So in any round, you can always make a big comeback.

604
00:31:44,022 --> 00:31:44,746
Scott: So there you go.

605
00:31:45,027 --> 00:31:50,659
Scott: Sign up for this before March 1st, when it begins and sign ups will close and the games shall begin.

606
00:31:51,964 --> 00:31:53,080
Scott: Even cowards have come.

607
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,259
Scott: There are many cowards who said, I'll just watch.

608
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:57,239
Scott: And then they have come back to sign up.

609
00:31:57,421 --> 00:31:58,553
Rym: I like to watch.

610
00:31:58,714 --> 00:31:59,220
Scott: That's right.

611
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:03,020
Scott: And the other meta moments, I guess PAX East is the next event.

612
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,540
Rym: PAX East, we're going to be there doing two or three events.

613
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,749
Rym: We're also enforcers.

614
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:07,980
Scott: Yeah, great.

615
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,211
Rym: I'm excited about that.

616
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:10,099
Rym: It's going to be a fun time.

617
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:10,621
Scott: Whoo.

618
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:12,239
Scott: You can sign up to be an enforcer, too.

619
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:15,120
Scott: If you're not a coward who doesn't want to join the Grand Prix.

620
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:20,960
Rym: The pass phrase to join the secret forum and all that stuff was actually really cool and inspiring.

621
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,475
Rym: And like all this business.

622
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:22,860
Scott: Sure.

623
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,718
Rym: It's it's exactly what every other con I joined the staff of should have been like.

624
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:30,379
Scott: OK, let's move on to the main bit.

625
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,240
Rym: So for a while, I would see and Scott would see game conventions.

626
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,160
Rym: We talked about this a little bit in previous episodes.

627
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,540
Scott: Well, you go to any library at a gaming convention, right?

628
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,520
Scott: The tabletop library.

629
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,580
Scott: And there's always these games you see there every fucking time and you never, ever play them.

630
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,279
Scott: But it's like the game that's been there for years and years and years.

631
00:32:48,881 --> 00:32:51,260
Scott: And there's sort of like these games sort of clump up to each other.

632
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:52,679
Scott: Like they're not the hot new games.

633
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,472
Rym: You'll see like Fortress America and laying on top of that is like a red dragon in.

634
00:32:57,613 --> 00:32:58,099
Rym: Oh, my God.

635
00:32:58,401 --> 00:32:59,277
Scott: And a shade geek.

636
00:32:59,297 --> 00:32:59,440
Rym: Yeah.

637
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:00,959
Rym: And maybe I guess you want to play.

638
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:03,499
Scott: Sometimes when you go in there, you find a gem.

639
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,300
Scott: For example, I found Hive in one of those piles of forgotten games.

640
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,441
Rym: Yeah.

641
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:10,400
Rym: And I'm glad we bought it because now the rerelease version is not as.

642
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,215
Scott: And Hive is suddenly popular, huh?

643
00:33:12,397 --> 00:33:12,620
Scott: Yeah.

644
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:17,440
Scott: So one of those games I always saw in that pile, but didn't realize was a game called Glory to Rome.

645
00:33:17,741 --> 00:33:24,217
Rym: Now, if nothing else, the tale of this game is a tale of how graphic design actually matters a lot.

646
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:24,920
Scott: A fuck ton.

647
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,840
Scott: But I've noticed a lot of people lately, especially Kickstarter games.

648
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:29,604
Scott: Sorry, Luke.

649
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:35,379
Scott: Our people are making board games where all they have is graphic design and the game itself.

650
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:39,880
Rym: My worry is that is almost more disappointing.

651
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,160
Rym: For example, Viva Java.

652
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,229
Rym: Haven't reviewed it yet.

653
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:43,019
Rym: Got to play it again.

654
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:48,720
Scott: But I worry Java is not that bad compared to a lot of the ones I'm seeing.

655
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,061
Rym: True.

656
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:51,479
Scott: But I saw one that was like beautiful graphic design.

657
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,279
Scott: Roll your dice, move your mice.

658
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:54,698
Scott: And it's like, what the fuck?

659
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:57,240
Rym: But Glory to Rome had the opposite problem.

660
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:59,040
Rym: It is actually a pretty great game.

661
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,680
Rym: But if you look at this, I mean, pause and click on this link and look at this game.

662
00:34:04,203 --> 00:34:05,599
Rym: This is the kind of game you see.

663
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,900
Rym: And then you just your brain just blocks it.

664
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:15,340
Scott: It's the kind of thing that they sell, like on that table next to the counter at the checkout of the game store that never sells even a single copy.

665
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:15,804
Rym: Yeah.

666
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:16,619
Rym: Like you look at that.

667
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Rym: You look at the cheap ass game next to it by the cheap.

668
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:21,279
Scott: To copy three Zune decks.

669
00:34:22,183 --> 00:34:23,312
Scott: Oh, my God.

670
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:24,179
Rym: I remember that.

671
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:24,782
Scott: Right.

672
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:27,920
Scott: A copy, an old print of Kobalt's Ate My Baby.

673
00:34:28,241 --> 00:34:28,484
Scott: Yeah.

674
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:29,719
Scott: A cheap ass game.

675
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,998
Scott: Maybe some ice house, some ice house pieces.

676
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,199
Scott: Not anymore, though.

677
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,813
Scott: And one of those up and one of those D20s with a D20 inside of it and a D6 with a D6 inside.

678
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:43,319
Scott: You know, every game store has that little spot.

679
00:34:43,742 --> 00:34:46,277
Scott: Oh, and the the dice bag with the flame pattern on it.

680
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:52,000
Rym: So the game was ignored by pretty much everyone because it was pretty ugly.

681
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,045
Rym: Yeah.

682
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:54,820
Scott: I don't even know how those copies got distributed.

683
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,521
Scott: Right.

684
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:59,820
Rym: And seeing like trying to play it with that old set, like seeing it laid out.

685
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,440
Rym: It's actually kind of confusing to even play.

686
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,400
Rym: It's confusing to play even like it's hard to see what's going on.

687
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,900
Rym: So there was a Kickstarter to just make the same game, but beautiful.

688
00:35:11,782 --> 00:35:14,760
Rym: And with a few minor exceptions, like the sewer card.

689
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:16,640
Rym: Yeah, the sewer card is beautiful.

690
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,280
Rym: It's just very bad graphic design.

691
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,720
Scott: Well, bad information design with the words being split up by the water spilling out of the sewer.

692
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:31,020
Rym: There's a few, two different graphic designers we know said the game is beautiful, but it has a few clearly amateurish design mistakes.

693
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,380
Rym: Yeah, but it's otherwise beautiful.

694
00:35:34,002 --> 00:35:34,939
Scott: Much better than the old one.

695
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,299
Rym: It is the exact same game.

696
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:42,960
Rym: Yet it is amazing because you'll actually play it and it feels good to play.

697
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,091
Rym: It feels clean.

698
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:44,979
Rym: It feels nice.

699
00:35:46,221 --> 00:35:51,068
Rym: So we're the kind of people who always say, yeah, I don't care what the game looks like.

700
00:35:51,351 --> 00:35:52,500
Rym: I only care about the game play.

701
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,437
Rym: And that is true to a point.

702
00:35:54,522 --> 00:36:04,720
Rym: Had I been tricked into playing the old glory to Rome, I probably would have liked it and would have given it a positive review and continued to play it, but it didn't, it wouldn't have felt nice to play.

703
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:06,836
Rym: There is something to be said for aesthetics.

704
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:08,899
Rym: For example, playing a Tigris and Euphrates.

705
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:18,798
Rym: I think a lot is added to it by the graphic design and the way the game is put together and the feeling you get, it feels like an agent game, even though it isn't just because of the way the iconography is.

706
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:28,707
Rym: So glory to Rome actually kind of a complicated game, but it's interesting because elements in this game are in other games.

707
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:33,816
Rym: For example, glory to Rome is probably the first game most people would know of.

708
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,720
Rym: that has the mechanic of someone takes an action.

709
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,139
Rym: Everyone else either follows or does something else.

710
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:43,537
Rym: You might notice that from a race for the galaxy or Puerto Rico.

711
00:36:43,557 --> 00:36:46,758
Rym: Well, well, you have to follow kind of.

712
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,540
Rym: So Puerto Rico is the mechanic of one person chooses an action.

713
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,511
Rym: Everyone else also gets to do the action.

714
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:53,000
Rym: This is a little different.

715
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:01,578
Rym: Someone chooses an action and everyone else can either follow and do the same action or think, and then they draw some cards to refill their hand.

716
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:01,920
Scott: Yep.

717
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:07,783
Rym: It also has the San Juan mechanic of every card is both card and currency.

718
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:08,125
Scott: Yup.

719
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:09,572
Scott: A lot of games have that.

720
00:37:09,653 --> 00:37:10,980
Rym: There are no bits in this game.

721
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,195
Scott: I think World of Warcraft card game does that also.

722
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:17,940
Rym: if I'm not mistaken, it's a common and often, well, it's, it's an interesting mechanic though.

723
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,029
Rym: It can be done poorly.

724
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:23,511
Rym: And so it is race to the galaxy, but cards do a lot of things in this game.

725
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:28,419
Rym: Cards are, uh, effectively victory points, but indirectly cards are actions.

726
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,563
Rym: Actions can be either played or part of some other part of the game called clientele.

727
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:34,291
Rym: cards are also buildings.

728
00:37:35,114 --> 00:37:36,360
Rym: And here's where the game gets interesting.

729
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:41,240
Rym: One, the card building powers are almost on the dune level.

730
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,697
Rym: It's like you get, you set up this basic are far greater than others.

731
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:50,657
Rym: Yes, because some are clearly more expensive in there for superior, but it's got the dune situation going on.

732
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:54,970
Rym: So if you, we just described the rules of the game, you'd be like, okay, it's pretty straightforward game.

733
00:37:55,232 --> 00:38:00,040
Rym: I build buildings, then I'd put some stuff in my vault and I do these basic actions and the games really straightforward.

734
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:08,997
Rym: But then you read the building cards and every card is like break this rule in a way that seems broken lie.

735
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:09,680
Rym: Here's a good example.

736
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,211
Rym: There's one card called the garden.

737
00:38:11,674 --> 00:38:12,380
Scott: I love the garden.

738
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:15,180
Rym: Not knowing any of the, any of how this game works.

739
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:22,360
Rym: What the garden says is upon completion, you may take one patron action for each influence you have.

740
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:27,260
Scott: Now keep in mind, as soon as you finish the garden, you get three influence for finishing the garden.

741
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:32,190
Scott: So therefore you're going to take at least three patron actions, if not more immediately.

742
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,940
Scott: I tend to build the garden early in the game.

743
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,020
Scott: I've done it a few times.

744
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,520
Rym: So I built it once late in the game and drew 15 fucking patrons.

745
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,177
Scott: If you have your own patron, the whole game.

746
00:38:40,238 --> 00:38:40,400
Scott: Sure.

747
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:44,140
Scott: I used it early in the game and it's just five patrons right at the start.

748
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:46,794
Rym: I won that game by like 20 points.

749
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:47,317
Scott: Yeah.

750
00:38:47,518 --> 00:38:49,671
Scott: Well, I mean, how did 15 patrons get in the pool?

751
00:38:49,852 --> 00:38:53,376
Rym: Well, I actually only pulled in, I think 12 or 13, but now the pool was empty.

752
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:53,900
Scott: Oh yeah.

753
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:55,274
Scott: You completely empty that motherfucker.

754
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:55,840
Scott: Exactly.

755
00:38:56,361 --> 00:38:58,715
Rym: And then I just finished the game with my million actions.

756
00:38:59,077 --> 00:38:59,399
Scott: Of course.

757
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:11,596
Rym: So that card basically lets you do, you know, imagine if you're playing Puerto Rico and all right, captain nine times, just do it nine times.

758
00:39:11,657 --> 00:39:15,038
Rym: No one else gets to, and they're all like this.

759
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:22,997
Rym: The really cool thing about this game is that it's actually, despite looks really complicated, like you look at how to play it.

760
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:29,180
Rym: And there's a reason I'm not explaining how to play the game because without visual aids, it's impossible.

761
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,812
Rym: There's no way I'm going to explain it in a way that I can explain the gist, right?

762
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:37,940
Scott: Is that everyone has cards in their hand and you draw more by thinking, right?

763
00:39:38,481 --> 00:39:42,580
Scott: And you have four, basically there's five different places cards can be.

764
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,969
Scott: They can be, well, I guess the deck, your hand, I guess there's going to be seven already.

765
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:49,300
Scott: the deck, your hand, right?

766
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,407
Scott: The shared deck is.

767
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,760
Scott: the deck is shared the pool, which is this middle of the table area.

768
00:39:54,461 --> 00:40:04,692
Scott: And then on each person will have four other places, which are, uh, influence, uh, their clientele, their stockpile and their vault, right?

769
00:40:05,074 --> 00:40:13,234
Scott: And to score points, you got to get cards to become influenced by building buildings or put them in the vault where they're worth points, our victory points.

770
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,939
Rym: But the other cool thing is that the amount of influence you have limits, how many things can go in your vault, right?

771
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:26,860
Scott: Everything else you are doing is just, you know, with the stockpiles and the client, the clientele is a way to get more actions.

772
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,356
Scott: The stockpiles, the way to get more cards out of the pool and into your control.

773
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:31,020
Scott: Right.

774
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:33,758
Scott: And to help you build buildings without anyone else.

775
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:33,980
Scott: Right.

776
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:42,240
Scott: And it's really just how can I build buildings and to get more influenced, to get more stuff in the vault using this machine of card playing.

777
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:42,580
Rym: Yup.

778
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:49,499
Rym: Now the machine gets a little complicated because it's sort of multi-staged in the sense that for, uh, trying to think of a really good example of this.

779
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:50,126
Rym: All right.

780
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,159
Rym: So your vault, right?

781
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,280
Rym: You putting stuff in the vault is the captain of this game.

782
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:55,969
Rym: Just put stuff in the vault.

783
00:40:55,989 --> 00:41:01,680
Rym: You just get victory points, just straight up, just tons of victory points, but your vault is limited by your influence.

784
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,919
Rym: You have to build buildings to get more influence, to put more stuff in the vault.

785
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,255
Rym: Yup.

786
00:41:05,901 --> 00:41:07,960
Rym: To build buildings, you need to take all these other actions.

787
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:14,920
Rym: So the crank to turn it around in your machine already, it's pretty circuitous and no one else is cranking along with you, right?

788
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,044
Scott: Everyone takes turns to choosing what to crank and they're cranking out of sync with you.

789
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:20,680
Scott: So how do you capitalize on that?

790
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:28,763
Rym: So rather than get into the depth of how to play the game, I want to just review the game and talk about why it's good and maybe what problems it has.

791
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:32,759
Rym: Reason number one, why this game is good, or at least interesting.

792
00:41:33,502 --> 00:41:38,411
Rym: It avoids a problem that has bothered me for a long time, but I never had a good way around it.

793
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:52,810
Rym: I call this problem, I'm gonna give it a long title, when you have to stop the game of power grid, pull out the rules and look up just what the fuck happens in phase three, because nobody remembers the details that happens in so many modern board games.

794
00:41:52,830 --> 00:42:04,020
Rym: You're playing, you're playing, you're playing, but then there's a game phase change or an end of game or a start of game of, uh, how many bits do we put out in a four player version?

795
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,272
Rym: Then someone else sits down a five player.

796
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:07,579
Rym: All right, we need seven more bits.

797
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:08,282
Rym: Yup.

798
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:10,070
Rym: This game has none of that.

799
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,240
Rym: There is one piece of setup.

800
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:13,948
Rym: Every player gets five cards in their hand.

801
00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:15,999
Rym: There's a number of sites out.

802
00:42:16,321 --> 00:42:18,232
Rym: It is just equal to the number of players.

803
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:19,017
Rym: That's it.

804
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:19,560
Scott: Yup.

805
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,639
Scott: No remembering there.

806
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:24,780
Rym: And you just draw one card for every player in the game and that sets the pool.

807
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,183
Rym: That's it.

808
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:26,920
Rym: There is nothing to remember.

809
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,798
Rym: The number of players determines every number that matters in the game.

810
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:30,878
Scott: Yup.

811
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,758
Scott: So once you know that and the game ends when it ends immediately.

812
00:42:34,778 --> 00:42:36,131
Rym: Ah, so that's the other piece.

813
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:36,860
Rym: End game.

814
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:44,719
Rym: This game gets around the situation of, uh, I almost said around another round and then it's over.

815
00:42:45,101 --> 00:42:46,186
Scott: So I drew the last card.

816
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:47,090
Scott: I drew the last card.

817
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,449
Rym: Does the game end immediately?

818
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:51,600
Rym: I built the last building.

819
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,229
Rym: Do we finish the round?

820
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:58,560
Rym: Uh, so I drew, I can't finish the auction phase, but there's none of that.

821
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,310
Rym: This game fucking ends.

822
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:04,778
Rym: When I say fucking ends, it ends in a catastrophic fashion.

823
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:12,500
Rym: The game, if you draw the last card from the deck at any point, the game immediately ends immediately is an interrupt.

824
00:43:12,762 --> 00:43:15,120
Rym: The likes of which I've never seen in games before.

825
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:19,488
Scott: So there is basically no question as, well, I mean, Netrunner has the same game ending.

826
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:20,131
Scott: interrupt, right?

827
00:43:20,152 --> 00:43:20,413
Scott: True.

828
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:21,580
Scott: You get seven points.

829
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,793
Scott: Jinteki doesn't do a damage for that score.

830
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:24,880
Scott: You win and you get seven points.

831
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,385
Scott: Game over.

832
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:25,771
Scott: Boom.

833
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:26,075
Scott: Right?

834
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:26,400
Rym: Yeah.

835
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,654
Rym: Scott plays the legionary action instead of following.

836
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:30,940
Rym: I think I draw the last cards.

837
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,129
Rym: No more actions happen.

838
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:32,876
Rym: We just score.

839
00:43:32,896 --> 00:43:32,956
Rym: Yup.

840
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:39,991
Rym: So another way the game ends is if you build the last sort of in town sites, buildings go on top of sites.

841
00:43:40,052 --> 00:43:41,100
Rym: This is cool mechanic there.

842
00:43:42,442 --> 00:43:48,274
Rym: So the rule book even points out if this occurs, there is no possible way to finish that building.

843
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:49,260
Scott: Of course not.

844
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,293
Rym: Because there are no more actions to take.

845
00:43:51,314 --> 00:43:52,140
Rym: The game ends immediately.

846
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,491
Rym: There is a building, a card.

847
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,283
Rym: There are multiple of them in the deck, the catacombs.

848
00:43:57,364 --> 00:44:00,359
Rym: If anyone builds it, the game immediately ends.

849
00:44:01,684 --> 00:44:05,979
Scott: And there's another card, the Forum Romanum, the best card that I've tried twice and got close once.

850
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:11,354
Rym: So the Forum Romanum, if you all know, there's one other end game condition before I talk about.

851
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:12,597
Rym: the Forum Romanum is in the book.

852
00:44:13,182 --> 00:44:20,598
Rym: If all players agree unanimously to surrender the game to a single player for any reason at any time, that's in there for whatever reason.

853
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:23,822
Scott: Well, I guess someone could just start running away with it and you don't want to finish it.

854
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:24,163
Rym: Yeah.

855
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:31,720
Rym: So the Forum Romanum, if anyone builds this, and again, there are multiple of them and all of these conditions are true simultaneously.

856
00:44:32,143 --> 00:44:33,759
Rym: It is a completed building in front of them.

857
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:36,780
Rym: They have one of every type of card in their clientele.

858
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,040
Rym: They have one of every type of card in their stock pile.

859
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,208
Rym: They immediately win.

860
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:42,855
Rym: The game immediately ends.

861
00:44:42,955 --> 00:44:44,160
Rym: Scores do not matter.

862
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:48,579
Rym: Reason number three, why this game is actually pretty cool.

863
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,880
Rym: The game is set such that the number of things you need to finish a building is equal to the victory points.

864
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,694
Rym: That thing is worth and the colors all line up.

865
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:00,804
Rym: And if you play the game, you'll see what I mean.

866
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,592
Rym: Everything lines up.

867
00:45:03,094 --> 00:45:04,360
Rym: Every number makes sense.

868
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,620
Rym: You don't have to think about anything except how you're trying to win.

869
00:45:08,162 --> 00:45:12,660
Rym: Like all the numbers of nouns of things to put in things is just so intuitive.

870
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:19,025
Rym: And the last reason why the game is great beyond all that is that scoring is dead simple.

871
00:45:19,106 --> 00:45:20,094
Rym: The game ends and just up.

872
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:20,618
Rym: That's the score.

873
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,254
Rym: Scoring takes basically zero time.

874
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:25,360
Scott: You count your influence.

875
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,880
Scott: You count the number of points in your vault.

876
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:29,839
Scott: You hand out these bonus cards to whoever earns them.

877
00:45:30,202 --> 00:45:33,299
Scott: And then you add three points to ever got a bonus card per bonus card.

878
00:45:33,702 --> 00:45:45,120
Rym: Now in terms of game plan, winning the game, I've won almost every game of it I've played since we played it with our friend Pete and his associated crew who were playing it wrong the entire time.

879
00:45:45,444 --> 00:45:45,956
Rym: They own the game.

880
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:46,059
Scott: Yep.

881
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:48,513
Rym: I read the rules once and realized they were playing wrong.

882
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:51,380
Rym: I feel bad for them, but that's how the cookie crumbles.

883
00:45:52,600 --> 00:46:00,818
Rym: But I win a lot and I got the opportunity at nerd NYC last week to teach the game to a bunch of people who never played it before, never even heard of it.

884
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,879
Rym: I was playing net runner and play it with them multiple times.

885
00:46:06,282 --> 00:46:08,999
Rym: And it was interesting because it was a smart group who took their turn.

886
00:46:09,761 --> 00:46:12,094
Rym: And the first round I ran away with the game.

887
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:13,160
Rym: Like it was just pointless.

888
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,680
Rym: I just won, but I didn't even have to do anything.

889
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,899
Rym: The second game was super close and I didn't win.

890
00:46:19,823 --> 00:46:24,117
Rym: So after that initial learning phase, people who are smart pick the game up right away.

891
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,817
Rym: But the end game strategies I think are very complex.

892
00:46:28,878 --> 00:46:44,432
Rym: This game, if I had to say probably breaks down like a dominion in the sense that based on the set of cards that people have in their initial hands and the flow of cards into their hands, you're trying to come up with the most efficient machine

893
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:45,799
Scott: simultaneously

894
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,300
Rym: trying to deny and hurt other people's strategies based on the machines they're making.

895
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:51,160
Scott: Yeah.

896
00:46:51,601 --> 00:47:00,520
Scott: One thing that I only thought of doing since I've last played the game is I realized the true power, the games I've played in the legionary was not used much.

897
00:47:01,302 --> 00:47:01,463
Scott: Right.

898
00:47:01,483 --> 00:47:04,540
Scott: And I was trying to think, well, why wasn't the legionary used very much?

899
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:04,882
Scott: Right.

900
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,402
Scott: You know, it's like people, you know, should, you know, everyone.

901
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:09,160
Scott: just just labor and craft and architect.

902
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,471
Rym: See I don't, I lesion a lot.

903
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:11,380
Rym: Legionary forgot.

904
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,760
Scott: Because people want to build their buildings, right?

905
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,755
Scott: So they keep choosing architect, labor and craftsmen.

906
00:47:18,796 --> 00:47:25,057
Scott: And I realized, no, what you have to do is if the people around you are doing better than you and you're getting behind, right?

907
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:30,686
Scott: If you try to build a buildings with those actions, you're also going to build, you're helping them build buildings.

908
00:47:31,068 --> 00:47:35,368
Scott: Legionnaire is the, it's a, it's, it's a catch up action.

909
00:47:35,388 --> 00:47:37,320
Scott: The people don't realize a catch up action.

910
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,620
Scott: What you do with legionary is you don't see, and here's the other mistake.

911
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:47,810
Scott: People took legionary and they, they looked at the buildings they were trying to build and asked for that resource.

912
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:49,620
Rym: Other people are trying to look at the buildings.

913
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,800
Scott: The other people are building.

914
00:47:51,141 --> 00:47:56,084
Scott: You asked for that resource to come on over to fuck them from building their buildings.

915
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:57,760
Scott: That's what the legionaries about.

916
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,111
Scott: Legionary basically people.

917
00:48:00,192 --> 00:48:01,600
Scott: It's not obvious to do that.

918
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:03,260
Rym: This is another reason why I like this game.

919
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:09,668
Rym: Anytime games present rituals or things you're supposed to say or do in the course of the game, that makes sense.

920
00:48:09,728 --> 00:48:10,552
Rym: I generally like it.

921
00:48:10,994 --> 00:48:12,120
Rym: and glory to Rome.

922
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:23,480
Rym: people who play the game will always be like Rome demands, you know, blow jobs because if you play legionary, you go around clockwise, every religion takes their hand, puts one card from their hand face up.

923
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,618
Rym: You got to have the thing in your hand to demand it.

924
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:26,920
Scott: Yeah.

925
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:32,295
Scott: You got to say like this, you people who don't speak Roman, put it down and say these see what this is.

926
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:42,490
Rym: And any player who does not have that thing in their hand simply is instructed to say glory to Rome.

927
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:44,720
Rym: I have nothing to offer Rome but glory.

928
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,021
Scott: Yeah.

929
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,699
Scott: Rome comes over and points at a pile of rocks and says, give me those.

930
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:49,469
Scott: And Rome demands a rubble.

931
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,380
Scott: And they say, there's no rubble around here.

932
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,183
Scott: Glory to Rome.

933
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:55,540
Scott: And I'm usually, we just say, Rome, go fuck itself.

934
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,684
Scott: Fuck you Rome.

935
00:48:56,965 --> 00:49:01,408
Rym: The game encourages the sort of, you know, renaming things.

936
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:05,900
Rym: I noticed I started, I just said to Blutem every time we reset the pool.

937
00:49:06,563 --> 00:49:11,083
Rym: And not only did no one blink at that, but they all understood exactly what I meant because they'd all played Puerto Rico before.

938
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:11,464
Scott: Yep.

939
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:14,399
Rym: There's one problem with this game.

940
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,149
Rym: This is a few.

941
00:49:16,189 --> 00:49:17,460
Rym: Well, here's the biggest problem.

942
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:22,889
Rym: Remember way back and we told everyone how sanctuary and Eagle are these great manga, but all you can't buy them.

943
00:49:23,432 --> 00:49:24,640
Rym: You can't buy glory to Rome.

944
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:26,525
Rym: Glory to Rome.

945
00:49:26,887 --> 00:49:29,380
Rym: This new re-released awesome version was a Kickstarter.

946
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,720
Rym: And as far as I can tell, there's basically no way to get it unless you kickstarted it.

947
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:40,148
Rym: I bought it at a significant premium from someone who got it in the Kickstarter on Amazon.

948
00:49:40,713 --> 00:49:44,440
Scott: Second hand, you might be able to get one at eBay or who knows, right?

949
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,530
Scott: Something like check the eBay.

950
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,339
Scott: See if there's any on there.

951
00:49:46,561 --> 00:49:50,326
Scott: You also might be able to buy the original version with the shitty graphic design.

952
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:59,897
Rym: You may be also, there are three available right now on Amazon for 60, $75 each plus significant shipping.

953
00:50:00,178 --> 00:50:00,360
Scott: Yeah.

954
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,975
Scott: So I guess it's possible to get it if you have dollars.

955
00:50:04,578 --> 00:50:08,753
Rym: No, one of these says plastic shell version.

956
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:09,897
Rym: No, no.

957
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:10,520
Rym: I want that one.

958
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:11,873
Rym: You want the black one?

959
00:50:11,893 --> 00:50:12,540
Rym: That's right.

960
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:14,391
Rym: I'll link to a picture of the good and bad one.

961
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,700
Rym: So you can't mess this up.

962
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,425
Scott: You want to get the one.

963
00:50:16,465 --> 00:50:17,975
Scott: that looks like it's a Nazi game.

964
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:18,660
Scott: That's the one.

965
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,744
Scott: That's the good one.

966
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:21,671
Rym: Sadly, I'm in a Roman game.

967
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:25,912
Scott: The black box looks, these guys are frigging Nazi Eagle on the front.

968
00:50:25,932 --> 00:50:27,200
Rym: It's not a Nazi Eagle.

969
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,780
Scott: It's a Roman Eagle, uh, was a Ridge with the Nazi stole it from the Romans.

970
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:35,799
Scott: So anyway, and it doesn't help that he's got a red flag under him.

971
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:49,543
Rym: So other problems with the game are that it's really fun, but the actual directional heuristics in this game from playing competently to playing well against experts are incredibly obtuse.

972
00:50:50,126 --> 00:50:54,279
Rym: Uh, I think I've got a handle on a few of them, but I haven't played enough to be sure.

973
00:50:55,061 --> 00:51:08,282
Rym: And I'm not sure how deep that rabbit hole goes, but I've noticed that counting cards doesn't matter that much because the deck is huge, but paying attention to which cards have come out or not is a big deal.

974
00:51:08,744 --> 00:51:15,139
Rym: If you know that all three catacombs were used as materials early on, then you don't have to worry about the game ending early.

975
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:19,945
Rym: Cause there are ways to set up a combo, lay down a catacomb and finish it in all one go.

976
00:51:19,985 --> 00:51:20,167
Scott: Right.

977
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:21,560
Scott: Well, I mean, think about this, right?

978
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,220
Scott: You can build a stone building early catacombs only cost three to right.

979
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:26,432
Scott: I built gardens early.

980
00:51:26,452 --> 00:51:27,180
Scott: So why not a catacomb?

981
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,400
Rym: I've seen people win the game with five victory points.

982
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,759
Rym: They just build the catacombs right away.

983
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:40,079
Scott: So if you do an early merchant before anyone else, and then you do a catacombs, the catacombs is three points and the merchant puts you ahead of everyone else, probably by at least three points.

984
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:48,883
Rym: But if you see someone start to build the catacombs just immediately and you merchant, you're basically preventing them from finishing the catacomb cause they'll you lose.

985
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:51,036
Rym: Cause you might have more, you will have more points.

986
00:51:51,097 --> 00:51:51,560
Rym: Probably.

987
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,140
Scott: Maybe depends how much you merchant.

988
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:54,544
Rym: Doesn't matter.

989
00:51:54,604 --> 00:52:00,758
Rym: Cause even if you merchant a wood with that three point bonus, revving the most wood, you'll have four extra victory points instead of his three extra.

990
00:52:00,939 --> 00:52:04,840
Scott: Well, ideally you would remember what he merchant did and merchant two of whatever.

991
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,640
Rym: Probably if he's trying to blitz catacomb, he hasn't merged into Dick cause he's trying to just finish as quick as possible.

992
00:52:09,881 --> 00:52:10,203
Scott: Maybe.

993
00:52:10,826 --> 00:52:11,147
Scott: Maybe.

994
00:52:11,388 --> 00:52:11,690
Scott: Yeah.

995
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:13,217
Scott: Tough call.

996
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:13,880
Rym: I don't know.

997
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,710
Rym: It's a pretty fun game.

998
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:19,760
Rym: Uh, I'm surprised at how quick it is to teach and how quick it is to play.

999
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:29,940
Scott: Like I'm actually really surprised considering how you think like it's a, you think you look at it and like, this is gonna be pretty confusing to a lot of people, but people sort of get it actually relatively quickly to what you would expect.

1000
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:35,004
Rym: So Scott, so the play sheets are really well designed, but what Scott uses, there's two sides.

1001
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:36,980
Rym: One side just summarizes what he'd action does.

1002
00:52:37,462 --> 00:52:41,363
Rym: And one side shows this really complex over engineered diagram of the flows of cards.

1003
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:43,098
Scott: The card, the chart is way better.

1004
00:52:43,138 --> 00:52:43,280
Rym: Yes.

1005
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,080
Rym: One in five people think that Scott's side is better.

1006
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,780
Rym: Every time I run this game for people, it's always five players.

1007
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,840
Rym: One dude puts that side face up and everyone else puts the other side face up.

1008
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,800
Scott: Chart side is way better cause it should, cause the cards are in different places and that side.

1009
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,480
Rym: How many games of glory to Rome have you won?

1010
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,820
Scott: Shows you arrows from which place they go to.

1011
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,272
Scott: What does that have to do with which side is better?

1012
00:53:03,575 --> 00:53:06,920
Rym: So, uh, I wonder if that side is seeding your brain in a poor way.

1013
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,768
Scott: Maybe the pro?

1014
00:53:08,788 --> 00:53:15,520
Scott: the real problem with glory to Rome is that the, there is a large random card element, right?

1015
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:22,634
Scott: Like you could draw some awesome buildings at the beginning and also the cards required to build them and to play them.

1016
00:53:22,735 --> 00:53:23,359
Scott: It could just happen.

1017
00:53:23,581 --> 00:53:25,600
Scott: And then you're going to get off to a great start.

1018
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:33,043
Rym: And the thing is it gets around that by, there aren't really direct paths to building buildings and finishing them from your hand.

1019
00:53:33,345 --> 00:53:34,855
Rym: There's one action that does that.

1020
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:38,100
Rym: The craftsman, you had to be able to effectively crank your machine.

1021
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,680
Rym: You gotta be building from multiple sources.

1022
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,294
Rym: So you need to get materials, not just from your handout, but into your stockpile and then, yeah, cause someone else might pick architect.

1023
00:53:46,314 --> 00:53:46,940
Scott: and then what do you do?

1024
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,380
Rym: Think and the pool is only refilled by the actions you're taking.

1025
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:54,400
Rym: So there are actually really complex directional heuristics around.

1026
00:53:54,921 --> 00:54:04,904
Rym: Do I lead merchant because I want to do the merchant action or do I lead merchant with two other cards to be a wildcard cause I don't want any stone to go into the pool.

1027
00:54:05,064 --> 00:54:05,325
Scott: Yep.

1028
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:14,480
Rym: Uh, the more, you know, the moral of this review is if you can get a hold of this game and you're a gamer, it's a gamer's game.

1029
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:20,028
Rym: This is a great game to whip out with other tabletop gamers because one, they doesn't take that long.

1030
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:21,397
Scott: It doesn't take up a lot of space.

1031
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:21,800
Rym: Yeah.

1032
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,640
Rym: One that you can just play it quickly.

1033
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:25,971
Rym: Actually it takes up more space than you'd expect.

1034
00:54:26,373 --> 00:54:27,740
Scott: I mean space in the box.

1035
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,161
Rym: Oh yeah.

1036
00:54:28,483 --> 00:54:31,680
Rym: But two, most people are not going to have this game.

1037
00:54:31,781 --> 00:54:34,780
Rym: So there's a lot of novelty and you can teach it quickly.

1038
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:41,302
Rym: And if you whip this out at a board gamer party, it's going to get played all night because people just don't have access to it right now.

1039
00:54:41,363 --> 00:54:43,037
Scott: And people like saying glory to Rome.

1040
00:54:43,098 --> 00:54:43,279
Rym: Yeah.

1041
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,946
Rym: The game's just really fun.

1042
00:54:44,987 --> 00:54:48,632
Rym: And I seen if you're a board gamer of any Stripe, this is just one of those games you should own.

1043
00:54:48,934 --> 00:54:49,075
Rym: Yeah.

1044
00:54:49,217 --> 00:54:49,559
Rym: Straight up.

1045
00:54:49,780 --> 00:55:04,440
Rym: I unqualifiedly say that you should own it even though I'm pretty sure it's going to break down far more rapidly than say Puerto Rico under like some all time great game, but it is a game that you should play.

1046
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,230
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1047
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:16,273
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and brand.

1048
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:16,638
Rym: Okay.

1049
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:17,408
Rym: For the logos.

1050
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:22,758
Scott: Be sure to visit our website@frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion, news, and more.

1051
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,678
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1052
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:30,409
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.
