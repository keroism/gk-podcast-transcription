1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,867
Rym: Hey, it's Monday, February 25th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:13,030
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:14,433
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:24,500
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight because all you haters were talking about augmented reality in light of Google Glass and a super long intro bit just to make Scott mad.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,360
Scott: I was about to comment on the super long intro bit, and now I'm making it longer.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,398
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:41,718
Rym: You know, Scott, what they say, "If you wrestle with a pig, you only make the pig happy and you get just as

8
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:41,959
Rym: muddy.".

9
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:49,419
Scott: I think what they say is, "If you let Rym know the thing he does that bothers you, he will do it

10
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:49,880
Scott: nonstop.".

11
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:56,160
Rym: Ah, but it's a catch-22, for if you do not let me know that it bothers you, then I will keep doing it because that's what I do.

12
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:59,439
Rym: And if you let me know, I'll keep doing it because that's what I do.

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,600
Scott: But you'll do it in a more goading fashion.

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:09,340
Rym: So in fact, the more you express disdain or criticism for a thing I do that you don't like, the more I'll do it.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,980
Rym: If you just never complain, I'll still do it, but at a baseline, manageable level.

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,203
Scott: There's only one solution.

17
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:23,278
Scott: Instead of letting Rym know that the thing bothers you, you must do something that bothers him whenever he does something that bothers you.

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,680
Rym: Except the only thing you ever do that I can even think of.

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,260
Scott: And eventually you can reverse Pavlov's dog him.

20
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:45,140
Rym: The best thing I've ever had Scott do is whenever we're ready to start a video or a show or anything, he'll just sit there going like... So I don't have a clean start, then I have to do some editing bullshit when we actually... It's too late, we're already recording.

21
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,920
Rym: So I went skiing over the weekend, and I feel like I'm stepping up my ski game to a big degree.

22
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:53,639
Rym: But I saw something kind of funny.

23
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,860
Rym: So you saw that South Park episode about ziplining, right?

24
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:57,579
Scott: Yup.

25
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,680
Rym: You ever been ziplining?

26
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:04,100
Scott: I mean, yeah, but not like that super ziplining, but like normal.

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,377
Scott: Like, oh, there's one zipline, I went down it, we...

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,200
Rym: Okay, so basically, I went ziplining with Emily in Costa Rica, but that was awesome.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,040
Rym: Because that was basically the only way to go through the rainforest and see all the inside business without hurting anything.

30
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:19,160
Rym: So that was just like crazy and awesome.

31
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:24,816
Rym: But ziplining pretty much anywhere else is exactly like that South Park episode.

32
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:25,940
Rym: It's just stupid.

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,260
Rym: So at Hunter Mountain, where I go skiing every weekend, they have zipline tours.

34
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,020
Rym: I can't imagine those people terribly appreciated that South Park episode.

35
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,600
Rym: I actually would expect that it hurt their business at least a little.

36
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:50,680
Rym: But I saw, I was standing in line to go up the big lift up to the top of the mountain, and they stop it because six zipliners are going to take the lift up to do their ziplining thing on the ski mountain.

37
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,220
Rym: So they stop the lift, because you can't get on a lift that's moving unless you're in skis or something.

38
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:57,199
Rym: And these guys walk over and they sit down.

39
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,420
Rym: What I saw that was interesting was that five out of six of them had GoPros.

40
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:04,198
Scott: Okay.

41
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,580
Rym: In fact, I would say that a full quarter of the people skiing had a GoPro on them.

42
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:13,340
Rym: And easily a third of those people had the newest, newest GoPro.

43
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:17,500
Rym: If GoPro sold stock, I would buy all of it.

44
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,519
Scott: I don't know why they didn't sell it before when I had that idea months ago.

45
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:22,307
Rym: I know exactly why.

46
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,840
Rym: Because it sucks to be a public company in the modern world.

47
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,619
Rym: If I own a company, I will never go public.

48
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:31,460
Scott: But it's such a no brainer to make mad money for me without having to do any work.

49
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:33,179
Scott: Just buy GoPro stock.

50
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,104
Rym: Exactly.

51
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:35,233
Rym: That's the problem.

52
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:35,878
Rym: It does not help them.

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,680
Rym: It gives them a pile of money and a pile of obligations.

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,320
Scott: Dude, with that pile of money, they can come out with an even crazier GoPro.

55
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:43,619
Scott: That would be so insanely good.

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,300
Rym: Yeah, see, that's, in my opinion, that's what's wrong with our entire economy right now.

57
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:58,947
Rym: If I have a company, like a video game company, and I make enough money to pay all my employees really well and keep doing what I'm doing and maybe do some things that I want to do that won't be profitable, that's all I want.

58
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:00,199
Rym: I don't need more.

59
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:06,853
Rym: I'd be happy to have a video game studio that could pay everyone enough to live in New York and have reasonable vacation time.

60
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:07,398
Rym: That's all I want.

61
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,780
Rym: But yeah, I skied, leveled up, I'm feeling good.

62
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,420
Rym: They told me I have to take this one kind of special lesson, and they were very clear.

63
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,820
Rym: The instructor was like, "Look, you've kind of hit the top of how these sort of group lessons go.

64
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:22,797
Rym: So come back and tell them you need

65
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:22,999
Rym: this.".

66
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,719
Rym: And she handed me a piece of paper and wrote a thing on it.

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,277
Rym: And she's like, "If you ski every weekend for the rest of the year and you come back and ask for that lesson, you will be a semi-professional

68
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:31,499
Rym: skier.".

69
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:32,639
Rym: And I was very proud of that.

70
00:04:34,562 --> 00:04:34,847
Rym: That's all.

71
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:35,660
Rym: I'm just tooting my own horn.

72
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,960
Rym: I was waiting for you to jump in with your own opening bit anecdote for today.

73
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,620
Scott: Well, I just wanted to let everyone fully bask in how full of yourself you are.

74
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:45,334
Rym: Oh, oh, you want to bask.

75
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:47,956
Scott: Your opening bit was basically, "I am so

76
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:48,219
Scott: great.".

77
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:48,775
Scott: I am.

78
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,819
Rym: More importantly, do any of you listeners live in this area and want to go ski with me?

79
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,575
Scott: So at work today, some co-workers are talking.

80
00:04:57,595 --> 00:04:58,520
Scott: I wasn't really paying attention.

81
00:04:58,601 --> 00:04:59,187
Scott: But a guy said,

82
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:00,258
Scott: "Non-burrito.".

83
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,946
Scott: And I was like,

84
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:01,572
Scott: "Mmm.".

85
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,371
Rym: Wait, non-burrito?

86
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:04,260
Rym: Like not a burrito?

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,580
Scott: Non, as in the bread from, you get an Indian restaurant.

88
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,710
Scott: And I was like, "Hey, that sounds pretty good.

89
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:13,960
Scott: You think I could put my leftover taco meat, which I have in the fridge right now, inside of a non?

90
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,817
Scott: Because I could just go down to Rode Bode and get a fresh

91
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:16,100
Scott: non.".

92
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,800
Rym: Now I am quite the advocate of breaking the shackles of expected uses of food.

93
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,058
Scott: Right, so they were like, "No, non-burrito is when you put Indian food in the non and then roll it up like a

94
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:26,500
Scott: burrito.".

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,029
Scott: And I was like,

96
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:27,355
Scott: "Oh.".

97
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,840
Rym: You know, that's a great analogy for the topic of the show, because think about it.

98
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,255
Rym: They came up with a great concept, "Use non in a non-standard

99
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:34,636
Rym: format.".

100
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:35,845
Rym: Get it?

101
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:36,960
Rym: Non-standard?

102
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,040
Scott: I think that they were discussing a place that actually served the Indian food in the non in burrito fashion.

103
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,119
Scott: So like an Indian bomb me.

104
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:44,824
Scott: I don't know.

105
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:47,680
Scott: But anyway, it was called a non-burrito, wherever they got it from.

106
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,886
Scott: But they didn't get it here.

107
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:50,919
Scott: They were talking about having it somewhere else.

108
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:53,917
Scott: And I was like, "Man, should I just put my taco meat in a

109
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:54,199
Scott: non?".

110
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,896
Scott: And they were like, "No, you shouldn't do

111
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:56,078
Scott: that.".

112
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,304
Rym: Ah, but see, that's the thing.

113
00:05:57,364 --> 00:06:01,198
Rym: They recognize the potential utility of non.

114
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:04,720
Rym: But yet they cannot break outside of the non box.

115
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,580
Scott: I had to buy a bag of cheese though at the grocery.

116
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,780
Rym: They cannot imagine far forward enough.

117
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,657
Rym: They're like, "Yeah, what if I take the non and I put the Indian food in

118
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:11,878
Rym: it?".

119
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,320
Rym: In case they did, but Indian, that'll be awesome.

120
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,058
Rym: And then you suggest, "Why don't I just put something

121
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:17,260
Rym: else?".

122
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,634
Rym: They're like, "No, you wouldn't play

123
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:19,018
Rym: god."

124
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:20,498
Rym: You wouldn't play gods.

125
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:23,980
Scott: Well, I don't know if I am going to play gods.

126
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,340
Scott: Because the thing is, I'll probably do that eventually.

127
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:27,611
Scott: But I don't know if I'll do it tonight.

128
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:28,640
Scott: Only for one reason.

129
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,160
Rym: I've never successfully reheated a non, for what it's worth.

130
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:31,841
Scott: Okay.

131
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:35,960
Scott: It's because I bought this package of corn tortillas, the little ones.

132
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:36,778
Rym: You got to use them up?

133
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,826
Scott: I got to use them up.

134
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:39,380
Scott: But the thing is, they fucking suck.

135
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,340
Scott: Like they fell apart.

136
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:42,160
Scott: I heated them up and I put the meat in them.

137
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,780
Scott: And then, boop, the meat went straight through.

138
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,478
Scott: I might have to double them up.

139
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,360
Rym: I, in my life, have a policy now on corn tortillas.

140
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:48,810
Scott: Yep.

141
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,159
Rym: So my policy is, I will only use a corn tortilla in something I'm cooking if I fry it in a pan.

142
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:56,940
Rym: I'm not just going to steam it or heat it up.

143
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,000
Rym: I'm either going to fry it or I'm using flour.

144
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,340
Scott: Listen, I would have wanted to buy flour ones.

145
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,380
Scott: I didn't have any of the ones I wanted.

146
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Rym: What kind of jank ass grocery store are you going to?

147
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,800
Scott: The one next to my house.

148
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:12,940
Rym: I mean, I had a problem buying stuff yesterday, but at least what I was trying to buy was weird.

149
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Rym: I was trying to buy vegan cream cheese.

150
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,000
Rym: And let me tell you.

151
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,020
Scott: Why did you want vegan cream cheese?

152
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,616
Scott: Don't ask.

153
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,064
Scott: Okay.

154
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:20,459
Rym: It is not easy to find.

155
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:23,480
Scott: What is even in vegan cream cheese?

156
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,833
Scott: Not cream or cheese.

157
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,097
Rym: I did not know.

158
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:33,819
Rym: I was partially curious as I asked to the manager of this grocery store, "Excuse me, do you carry vegan cream

159
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:34,020
Rym: cheese?".

160
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:36,337
Rym: My mind immediately said, "How could such a thing

161
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:36,518
Rym: be?".

162
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:38,397
Rym: And the manager is like, "Vegan cream

163
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:38,620
Rym: cheese?".

164
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,919
Scott: Is she just called hummus?

165
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,318
Scott: I mean, what would you call it?

166
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,080
Scott: Right?

167
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,799
Rym: So it exists.

168
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:45,500
Scott: Okay.

169
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,240
Rym: And we acquired some, but not at the grocery store.

170
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,653
Scott: What's it made of?

171
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:53,460
Rym: As far as I can tell, oils of various kinds.

172
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:53,697
Scott: Just oil.

173
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,599
Scott: Okay.

174
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:55,254
Rym: Anyway.

175
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,380
Scott: So it's margarine.

176
00:07:57,724 --> 00:08:00,799
Rym: It's more like... I haven't even looked at it yet, but it came in a weird box.

177
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:03,899
Scott: With sugar in it?

178
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:05,320
Rym: At least that is weird.

179
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:08,940
Rym: Flower tortillas are in the key food in Beacon.

180
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:13,955
Scott: Yeah, the key food always has everything, but I was trying to go to the sea town next to my house.

181
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:15,620
Scott: Anyway.

182
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,920
Rym: But they have corn tortillas, but not flour?

183
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,620
Rym: I feel like in America, more people eat flour tortillas.

184
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,460
Scott: They've had them before.

185
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,459
Scott: They just didn't sell them.

186
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,140
Scott: They didn't have them in stock at that moment, and they had so many corn ones.

187
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,540
Rym: Actually, guys, there's a thread in our forum about moving to New York City.

188
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,719
Rym: That's one thing you really need to realize if you move here.

189
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:33,900
Rym: If you live anywhere else in the country, go to a grocery store.

190
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,020
Rym: The idea that they're out of something is crazy.

191
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,986
Rym: It's like, "What do you mean?

192
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:38,352
Rym: they're out of

193
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:38,575
Rym: milk?".

194
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,059
Rym: But yet in New York, grocery stores sell out.

195
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,280
Scott: Right.

196
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:44,120
Scott: There's no supermarket that has everything, right?

197
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,060
Scott: You're going to a regular grocery.

198
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,440
Rym: It's not super.

199
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,660
Rym: It only has like 30 gallons of milk.

200
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,400
Rym: If someone buys a bunch, there just isn't any until the next day.

201
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,340
Scott: Yeah, they get deliveries so often.

202
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:02,240
Scott: They're not giant mega groceries that have trucks full of food showing up every day, and each individual one doesn't have enough customer, so that's how it goes.

203
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:02,719
Scott: All right.

204
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:04,237
Scott: News.

205
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:07,340
Scott: So there was this guy in Australia.

206
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,479
Scott: His name was SuperDAE.

207
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:17,719
Rym: Oh, is that the guy who hacked the encryption key in the PS3?

208
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:18,559
Scott: No.

209
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:18,932
Scott: Okay.

210
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:24,638
Scott: That's another guy who is going to school at CMU.

211
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,859
Rym: Is that the guy that Totillo just wrote an article about?

212
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:27,277
Scott: Yes.

213
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:27,696
Scott: Okay.

214
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,679
Rym: So we're talking about a different guy.

215
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:32,820
Scott: No, the guy who Totillo wrote an article about is the guy I'm talking about.

216
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,700
Rym: Okay, so then I mistook the guy he wrote an article about with a different guy.

217
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,180
Scott: That's right.

218
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:36,579
Rym: Okay.

219
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:44,779
Scott: The guy he wrote the article about is SuperDAE Australian guy, and what he did is- Wait, is his name SuperDAE Australian guy?

220
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:45,386
Scott: One word?

221
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:49,160
Scott: I think his actual name does start with a D. It's in the article somewhere.

222
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,360
Rym: No, but is Australian guy in his name?

223
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:51,775
Scott: No.

224
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,700
Rym: Because you didn't make that clear.

225
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:55,019
Scott: No, it's not.

226
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:57,060
Rym: This is why the Oxford comma is anyway.

227
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:02,310
Scott: But anyway, this guy basically "hacked" various video game companies.

228
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:02,988
Scott: Oh, Dylan.

229
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,000
Scott: Dylan's his name.

230
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,060
Scott: So Dylan, that's easier to remember than SuperDAE.

231
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:09,799
Scott: Of course, I remembered SuperDAE first.

232
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:16,700
Scott: He hacked into Epic, the Gears of War company, and Microsoft.

233
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:21,980
Scott: The exact extent of his hacking is unclear and the methods of his hacking.

234
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,440
Scott: I hate calling it hacking when all it is is you got someone's password.

235
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,676
Scott: It seems like you basically got people's passwords or email accounts who work at these places.

236
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,180
Scott: We need a level- And was able to log into various systems, including the system that lets you just buy dev kits, right?

237
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:53,180
Scott: Because imagine if you work at some company that makes Xbox games, there's a website you can go to to buy Xbox development hardware and software that you have to log into after you become a registered official Microsoft Xbox developer and sign an NDA and all these contracts.

238
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,899
Scott: They give you a log in on that site.

239
00:10:55,741 --> 00:11:08,979
Scott: Since he hacked into or got, you know, logging credentials from the video game developers networks, he was able to get that other information and he just had like Xbox and PlayStation dev kits sent to his house, just bought them.

240
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:14,160
Scott: And, you know, the exact extent of what he was able to do is not clear.

241
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:15,660
Scott: It doesn't seem like he was evil.

242
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:24,000
Scott: And it seems like some of the companies even, you know, liked him for just telling them how he got in and, you know, they patched up the vulnerabilities he told them about.

243
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:33,540
Scott: But looks like he went a little step too far and the FBI went over there and the Australians cooperated and they snatched him up all this stuff.

244
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:34,640
Rym: Come on, Australia.

245
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,740
Scott: It doesn't seem like he doesn't seem like he's in jail, but they took all this shit.

246
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:47,719
Rym: So, you know, that's actually when it in general to to really zoom out when it comes to computer quote, unquote, crime, especially in the United States.

247
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,679
Rym: Pretty much the worst thing they can do to you is the thing they always do, even if you're found innocent, which is take all your shit and never give it back.

248
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:56,177
Scott: Yep.

249
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:57,837
Scott: It's bullshit.

250
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,396
Rym: Yeah.

251
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,000
Scott: Well, search and seizure, seizure anyway.

252
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:02,957
Rym: So is that it?

253
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,639
Rym: Just cool article.

254
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,157
Scott: Yeah.

255
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:15,075
Scott: You should read this, you know, to see like, oh, you know, you can, you know, because the reason we know this guy was legit is because he wrote all this stuff about what's going to be in the PS4.

256
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,740
Scott: And he was really right on target.

257
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:17,931
Rym: Yeah.

258
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,552
Rym: Two butts.

259
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:23,011
Scott: So anything he has to say about the Xbox 480 720, probably also right on target.

260
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,080
Rym: Stay on target.

261
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:29,120
Scott: Stay on target.

262
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,283
Rym: So in another kind of interesting and open ended bit, Scott showed me this article and we've been.

263
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:37,752
Rym: I was puzzling through it to.

264
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,660
Scott: I still haven't really figured it out.

265
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,400
Rym: So independently, Scott and I have been having trouble with YouTube lately.

266
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:43,738
Scott: Yeah.

267
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:45,177
Rym: As many people have.

268
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,000
Scott: It used to be in the olden days when you tried to go to YouTube, even not in the RIT days.

269
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,340
Scott: That doesn't count with our OC threes.

270
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,080
Rym: Oh my God.

271
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,598
Rym: I miss those.

272
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:59,520
Scott: But when we had like Cablevision and Beacon, you can go to YouTube, you could push pause and the video would completely load pretty quickly and then you would push play.

273
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:10,892
Rym: Now when I first moved to New York City, I had Verizon FiOS, so I would pick a 1080p like 45 minute long video and the whole thing would just buffer in like a minute and just be ready to rock 1080p.

274
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:11,818
Scott: Yes.

275
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,661
Scott: This isn't like 09, 010.

276
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:28,919
Rym: In the last few weeks, YouTube's been, I think in the last year and a half, you know, that's interesting because for me, YouTube has been just infinitely perfect and we've had YouTube problems here intermittently, intermittently for very short periods of time until the last several weeks.

277
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:42,600
Rym: So maybe the last four or five weeks, YouTube has gotten increasingly slow and have an increasing problems here that I never had before, despite the fact that I have basically infinite bandwidth and while YouTube will just fucking come to a halt.

278
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:45,215
Rym: Any other video site is still streaming 1080p just fine.

279
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,060
Rym: Netflix, perfect 1080p just fine.

280
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,240
Rym: It's just YouTube.

281
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,119
Scott: Even at my house, like sometimes YouTube, you get the spinny spinny, but Netflix always plays 1080p just fine and I don't have FiOS.

282
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:09,799
Rym: Now this article is specific to Time Warner and based on anecdotal testing that Scott and I have conducted, it appears to have an effect if you are a Time Warner customer, but not on FiOS.

283
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,600
Scott: Well, it's, you know, we've done two tests, right?

284
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,260
Scott: It's not much.

285
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,600
Rym: Hence I said anecdotal evidence, just the two of us.

286
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,379
Scott: But anyway, uh, and that was the only did the test once.

287
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,340
Rym: But basically you use my wireless network, which you claim has problems anyway.

288
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,839
Scott: Here's the thing is there's a thing you can do that works.

289
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,360
Scott: We don't know why it works and we don't know how, where and when and where it works.

290
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,260
Scott: It works sometimes and not other times.

291
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:36,660
Scott: And we're not sure what the real problem is.

292
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:43,700
Scott: And there is some people are claiming things that they don't have evidence for because it sometimes works and it's weird.

293
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,551
Rym: So I did some investigation and I tried to kind of chart it out and all I will say is this.

294
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:54,057
Rym: It is feasible that this would work, that a thing like this would have the intended effect.

295
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:58,600
Rym: It is also feasible that I can explain why.

296
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:09,240
Rym: And I've come up with three or four sort of high level scenarios where this would be the case, but anecdotally it seems to work anecdotally completely shooting from the hip.

297
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,300
Rym: I am making no claim to back this up at all.

298
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,940
Rym: This is pure rampant abject conjecture.

299
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:23,300
Rym: The time order cable is probably possibly maybe with no evidence on my part at all.

300
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,020
Rym: Don't sue me for libel or slander throttling the YouTube CDN.

301
00:15:28,422 --> 00:15:30,940
Scott: I think it's more, here's the real thing, right?

302
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:40,156
Scott: A lot of the explanations we come up with would mean that Google is doing something that is not optimal and has been doing it for a while, which is hard to believe.

303
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,460
Rym: Half of them would imply that ISPs and peering arrangements are causing the problems.

304
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:47,858
Rym: Well a third of them.

305
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:59,460
Rym: The three thirds I can come up with are Google's internal CDN, peering internet bullshit, which may or may not involve the lower level ISPs, but Google or DNS shenanigans causing weird asymmetric routes.

306
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,120
Scott: I don't think there's any DNS shenanigans.

307
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,396
Rym: There very well could be.

308
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:07,939
Rym: In fact, I ran into a complication because you see, when I was at RIT.

309
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,558
Scott: Because I'm using Google DNS.

310
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,500
Scott: I'm not using Time Warner DNS.

311
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:13,032
Rym: Yes.

312
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,040
Rym: Now there were reports in the early days of Google DNS that that would actually slow down your YouTube.

313
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:20,279
Scott: Oh, right.

314
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,400
Scott: Why would Google using Google DNS slow down Google YouTube?

315
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:36,160
Rym: Because your ISP's DNS could, for example, be set to automatically redirect you first to the IPs of the nearest CDNs, but a global like open DNS.

316
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:43,579
Scott: But I thought that the Google open DNS is clever to know where you're coming from and thus will give you different answers.

317
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,479
Rym: Ah, but you can only be clever so far.

318
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,198
Scott: I think it's Google is about as clever as it can be.

319
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:49,239
Rym: It's hard to say.

320
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,280
Rym: DNS also is an ancient protocol.

321
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:53,280
Scott: Google is also ancient genius.

322
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,540
Scott: But here's what I ran into.

323
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,180
Rym: Just to give you some clarity on my old age.

324
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,060
Rym: When I was at RIT, the beginnings of IPv6 were becoming available for initial testing.

325
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,438
Rym: And I had an account on the old six bone, which was the sort of test internet for IPv6.

326
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:14,715
Rym: And yeah, IPv6 is not commonly used unless you're an IT dude who's deep into networking, you don't really run into it.

327
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:21,779
Rym: And I did a domain look up to play with some of this stuff last night and try to rationalize my theories.

328
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,280
Scott: You're trying to do IPv6 YouTube?

329
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,260
Rym: No, I just did a look up and I got all these IPv6 addresses.

330
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,320
Rym: I was like, what the f... Oh, right.

331
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,599
Rym: IPv6 exists.

332
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,493
Rym: And I had to remember all the weird details of.

333
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,240
Rym: IPv6 resolves addresses.

334
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:38,478
Rym: That's a separate thing.

335
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,380
Rym: A little known fact, you know what the DNS record is for an IPv6 address?

336
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,516
Rym: Forward look up?

337
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:46,017
Scott: Oh, it's not A?

338
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:47,331
Scott: That's not A. Is it B?

339
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:48,136
Rym: No.

340
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,099
Scott: That's a good guess.

341
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,119
Rym: That's a pretty good guess.

342
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:51,277
Scott: How about P?

343
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,739
Rym: You will never guess.

344
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:55,144
Scott: Is it F?

345
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,900
Scott: Because F is the sixth letter of the alphabet?

346
00:17:59,940 --> 00:17:59,985
Scott: No.

347
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:00,580
Scott: No?

348
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
Rym: Do you know other names, other kinds of records?

349
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:03,930
Scott: C name?

350
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,080
Rym: All right.

351
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,040
Rym: So C name is a whole word basically as opposed to just A.

352
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:10,200
Scott: MX, TXT.

353
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:11,212
Rym: Yup.

354
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:11,979
Rym: PTR.

355
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:14,500
Rym: PTR is one of the most important records you can write.

356
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:15,719
Rym: I don't know.

357
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:19,036
Rym: It's A, A, A, A.

358
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:19,660
Scott: Awesome.

359
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:20,677
Scott: It's not even six A's.

360
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,876
Rym: It's just four A's.

361
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,255
Rym: Do you know why it's four A's?

362
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:25,700
Rym: Believe that is GeekNights' trivia.

363
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,316
Rym: I dare anyone.

364
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,300
Scott: Because it's four times as many bits as an A record.

365
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,499
Scott: It's four A records number of bits.

366
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:45,640
Rym: The best I can say, and I'm trying to not say a lot, is that based on my knowledge of networks and it's one of the few areas in technology where I know a lot more than Scott.

367
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,100
Rym: There aren't that many.

368
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:51,040
Rym: Scott's a better coder than me and all sorts of things, but this is one area I got.

369
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:52,939
Rym: It is feasible that this works.

370
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:54,739
Rym: I can come up with reasons why.

371
00:18:55,221 --> 00:19:02,560
Rym: I cannot prove without a lot of work on my part if any of them are actually why, and it'll be difficult to prove beyond any reasonable doubt.

372
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,880
Scott: It's tough to even tell if it's working when you use it.

373
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:12,259
Scott: So what you got to do is if your YouTube is sucking, try to do this and turn it on and off and try different videos a whole bunch.

374
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,060
Rym: No, no.

375
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,720
Rym: More importantly, try this.

376
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,098
Scott: Use a stopwatch to see how fast they load.

377
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:16,877
Scott: Try this.

378
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,971
Rym: Come up with some method and tell us the results.

379
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:28,826
Rym: because I brought this up as the news, even though Scott's the one who showed it to me primarily because I'm going to investigate this to the extent of my ability

380
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,515
Scott: because the fact there is

381
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:37,338
Rym: too much anecdotal evidence that it works, and I'm frankly pissed off that YouTube doesn't work that well anymore on files.

382
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,020
Scott: That's right.

383
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,958
Scott: And the thing is, when I did enable this at my house, YouTube was so fast, 10 AP.

384
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:48,577
Scott: The gray bar was literally running away from the play dot, whereas before the spinning was there.

385
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,060
Scott: So, yeah.

386
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,837
Rym: So things of the day, this.

387
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:01,090
Rym: apparently it was margarita week.

388
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:07,470
Scott: One of those fake holiday is sangria in any way related to a margarita.

389
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:09,369
Scott: I know Mexican restaurants serve both.

390
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:10,409
Rym: Not at all.

391
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:13,370
Scott: I saw some sangria at the grocery store today and this really nice job.

392
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,489
Rym: It's gotta be awful.

393
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:18,610
Scott: And I was thinking, man, I wonder if Rym will drink that so I can get the nice jug.

394
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:19,789
Scott: No, no.

395
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,809
Rym: I realize you can just buy jugs on Amazon.

396
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:23,389
Rym: Really nice one.

397
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,107
Scott: That's a good idea.

398
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:27,064
Rym: If you want a particularly good jug, that is nice stopper.

399
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:28,069
Rym: search for a growler.

400
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:34,109
Scott: I want a jug that's got three X's on the side and then I want to put water in it growlers that have three X's on the side.

401
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:34,990
Rym: Yeah.

402
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:41,824
Rym: Now, if you want a clay jug, you know the who, who, who, who, I would buy the music store.

403
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:43,250
Rym: They don't sell those.

404
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:43,790
Rym: The music store.

405
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,405
Scott: I'm sure they do.

406
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:45,970
Scott: They sell wood blocks.

407
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,190
Rym: They also don't sell washboards at the music store.

408
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,450
Scott: And they sell tambourines.

409
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,810
Scott: They might as well fucking sell a jug.

410
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,090
Rym: All I can think of is the Homer Simpson and Lisa with the hoot.

411
00:20:56,772 --> 00:21:04,090
Rym: So this is a perfectly serious video on how to make a perfectly excellent margarita margarita mix in the freezer.

412
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:08,190
Rym: This video is truth in a Darryl Ceratian sense.

413
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:09,728
Rym: There's this moment.

414
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,009
Rym: Basically it's a parody video.

415
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:11,969
Rym: You're going to watch it.

416
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,789
Rym: If you actually try to do what this video says, you're going to get sick.

417
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:17,310
Rym: Don't do it.

418
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,670
Scott: If you try to make a margarita, you're going to get sick.

419
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:24,988
Rym: The reason I say that as a joke, cause the first step is to take a shot of grappa.

420
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:27,669
Rym: You would not like grappa.

421
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:28,389
Scott: No kidding.

422
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,829
Rym: Most people do not like grappa.

423
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,008
Rym: I love grappa.

424
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:32,268
Scott: Of course.

425
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:34,209
Scott: Anything is bad.

426
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,169
Scott: Ram, how do you like the liver and onions?

427
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,470
Rym: Disgusting.

428
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,428
Rym: I hate liver onions.

429
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,106
Rym: Oh my God.

430
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:39,828
Rym: Don't even.

431
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,509
Scott: Cause you seem to like nasty things that no one likes.

432
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:59,626
Rym: So this video is truth because the instructions say something to the effect of you need one bottle of tequila, one bottle of gross old triple sec, because triple sec is the bottle of gross old liquor, much like that peppermint schnapps at Gojo's house

433
00:21:59,947 --> 00:22:02,041
Scott: or that yellow shit you used to make a Harvey Wall down

434
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:02,222
Rym: here.

435
00:22:03,718 --> 00:22:04,150
Scott: Your favorite?

436
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,410
Rym: Your dad's favorite.

437
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:08,390
Rym: I could get some of that.

438
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:09,530
Rym: We could make a Harvey Wallbanger.

439
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:10,108
Scott: That's all you.

440
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,550
Rym: Want to have a Harvey Wallbanger party?

441
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:11,966
Scott: All you.

442
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:18,090
Rym: Because if we, if we tell Chase that he'll already be here, I think we should have a Harvey Wallbanger party.

443
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:18,446
Scott: All you.

444
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,010
Rym: Anyway, this video is great.

445
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:21,810
Rym: I found it randomly.

446
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:22,779
Rym: It only has 358 views.

447
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:27,110
Rym: So you're going to get in on the early stages of this video.

448
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,270
Scott: It's not going to get much farther than this.

449
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,370
Rym: It's by a guy named Mark Buttcavage.

450
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:32,450
Scott: That's a good name.

451
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,510
Rym: I found it by searching for his name again.

452
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,503
Scott: It's worth about 308 views.

453
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:42,288
Scott: So there seems to be this new college major that's been going on for the, they invented it maybe five, six years ago.

454
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,350
Scott: And then it's called IT.

455
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:46,530
Scott: It's called get quad copters and make them do something.

456
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:55,330
Scott: And people seem to be doing this for like their masters projects is get some quad copters, make them do something, make them do a formation, make them say one thing.

457
00:22:55,971 --> 00:23:04,110
Rym: If quad copters like kids have today existed when I was at RIT, oh fuck, would I have gotten myself expelled anyway.

458
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:10,509
Scott: So this guy, he does something slightly more impressive than what all the other graduate students did with their quad copters.

459
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:16,790
Scott: He basically gets the quad copter to balance an inverse pendulum, which is also known as a stick.

460
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:25,790
Scott: So sort of like when you have a pencil and you hold it on your hand and you keep the pencil upright, but moving your hand, calling it inverse pendulum is like calling your elbow, your bender and anti bender, right?

461
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:31,190
Scott: So he gets this, uh, you know, quad copter to basically balance this inverted pendulum.

462
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:38,969
Scott: And then the really impressive part is it throws the inverted pendulum into the air at another quad copter catches it and balances it.

463
00:23:39,994 --> 00:23:41,389
Scott: It's pretty insanely awesome.

464
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:49,490
Scott: Uh, I was literally, usually I'm like up another guy doing something with a quad copter, but I saw this and I was like, Whoa, I am impressed.

465
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,154
Scott: I will think of day.

466
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:56,730
Scott: you play gods, you M play good at quad counter programming.

467
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:01,950
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club book was the great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald.

468
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:02,809
Rym: We did a show on it.

469
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:03,428
Rym: It's done.

470
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:04,869
Scott: We're never going to talk about it again.

471
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:05,270
Rym: Yup.

472
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,130
Rym: But suffice it to say, if you didn't read it, you're a terrible person.

473
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,130
Rym: If you didn't enjoy it and appreciate it, you're also a terrible person.

474
00:24:11,191 --> 00:24:11,488
Rym: That's right.

475
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:18,950
Scott: The new book club book is player of games by E and M banks, which is the second book in the culture series.

476
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,310
Scott: The first book is optional.

477
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:21,049
Scott: I didn't read it.

478
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,070
Scott: I just started reading book two and I guess two chapters or whatever.

479
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:33,907
Scott: I don't know how many, cause I don't think it has even as chapter markers, but, uh, I didn't need to read the first one to understand the second one and it's called fucking player of games.

480
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,669
Scott: This book could not be more GeekNights.

481
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,230
Scott: I don't think there could be a more GeekNights book.

482
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:46,890
Scott: It's my, you know, I mean, we probably like prince of nothing more, at least judging by what's happened so far, but this is more GeekNights than prince of nothing.

483
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,670
Rym: I think the phrase would be, it is perhaps in our wheelhouse.

484
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:51,329
Scott: It is our wheelhouse.

485
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:56,789
Scott: It is as if, you know, I was, I needed to move somewhere and I really liked the house I was living in.

486
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:03,810
Scott: Then I saw a house that seemed, you know, the doorway was the exact shape of my body and the toilet was the exact shape of my butt.

487
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,230
Rym: You realize all I can think of now is that Japanese horror comic about this is my hole.

488
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:12,810
Rym: It was made for me and it's a hole in the shape of a dude and he jumps into it.

489
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:13,947
Scott: That's exactly what this is.

490
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,450
Rym: Have you ever read that comic?

491
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:15,786
Scott: No.

492
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,670
Rym: I forget what it's called.

493
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,290
Rym: It's great though.

494
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:18,170
Scott: Other meta moments.

495
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:18,250
Scott: Yes.

496
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,930
Scott: The next convention is PAX East.

497
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:20,290
Scott: PAX East.

498
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,105
Scott: Oh shit.

499
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,270
Scott: We're enforcing and paneling and gaming.

500
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,450
Rym: We are doing on Saturday or Friday, I already forget, I gotta look at the schedule again.

501
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:31,770
Rym: We are doing mastering game mechanics.

502
00:25:32,011 --> 00:25:33,950
Rym: We are doing practical game theory.

503
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:42,730
Rym: We are possibly doing a third yet unnamed events and they're all in these small tabletop theater for once instead of in the giant normal theaters.

504
00:25:43,691 --> 00:25:55,199
Rym: So not going to say that it's going to fill, but I'll put it this way, when we do panels in the normal rooms, they see, you know, between 500 and a thousand people and a lot of people show up.

505
00:25:56,371 --> 00:26:01,210
Rym: If history is any indication, this room seats between 50 and a hundred people.

506
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:05,285
Rym: So we're already five times the capacity if we get our basic attendance.

507
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:07,287
Scott: guys are listening to the show.

508
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,990
Scott: Don't show up in the front of the line, get at the back of the line.

509
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,155
Scott: So that way people who don't know who we are will be at the front of the line and then show up at the line.

510
00:26:15,316 --> 00:26:18,523
Scott: anyway, in case the room doesn't fill, you got to pack it in and fill it up.

511
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:25,750
Rym: But also the reason you should get in line is that because it's not the big normal theater, it's going to be really hard to video it effectively.

512
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:32,030
Rym: So unlike every panel we've done up to this point, there's a good chance there won't be good video and audio of the presentation.

513
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:32,603
Scott: Maybe not.

514
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,408
Scott: We'll find out.

515
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:38,070
Rym: And because it's a smaller room, we might do it more classroom style, which is going to be pretty awesome.

516
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,888
Rym: So I'm cool with that.

517
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,770
Rym: ConnectiCon submit your goddamn panels.

518
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,530
Rym: I am actually scheduling panels every minute that goes by that you don't submit your panel.

519
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,989
Rym: You are less likely to get a good slot or a slot at all.

520
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:50,463
Rym: Yes.

521
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,330
Rym: We're we already have more panels than we need.

522
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,330
Rym: I could fill the entire schedule, but some of those panels, I would like, I would like more panels.

523
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:04,910
Scott: We'd like another panel that is better than them to kick their asses out because we really don't want to have 10 Homestuck panels, right?

524
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:05,990
Scott: One is enough probably.

525
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:06,690
Rym: Anime Boston.

526
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:11,050
Rym: I don't think anyone's heard back from Lou yet, but I assume we'll be there in April.

527
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:11,770
Rym: Yep.

528
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,169
Rym: And we will be doing between three and six panels.

529
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:21,087
Rym: Some number of panels and I don't know, Pax Australia, all that other stuff kind of down the road.

530
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,163
Rym: Pax Prime, Pax Dev, Pax East 2014.

531
00:27:26,163 --> 00:27:26,470
Scott: Uh, yeah.

532
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:28,910
Scott: Any other meta things?

533
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:29,888
Scott: Oh, of course.

534
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,342
Scott: This is the, this week, right?

535
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:41,610
Scott: At the end of this week, we will begin the first ever FRC gaming Grand Prix.

536
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,589
Scott: I'm not going to go over all the info again.

537
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:52,910
Scott: I'm just going to say that number one, it is a competition in games of skill that is accessible to all peoples capable of listening to a podcast.

538
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,250
Rym: So what about people who are blind and have no arms?

539
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,667
Scott: They might have a hard time, but they might also be able to play a monkey.

540
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:07,489
Scott: Um, but yeah, everyone who listens to this show and anyone on the whole internet can participate.

541
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,129
Scott: We're going to find out who is the strongest gaming listener through a series of point scoring game rounds.

542
00:28:13,814 --> 00:28:15,450
Scott: All of the info is on the website.

543
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:22,550
Scott: If you want to join, you have to read the forum post and then, you know, join the forum if you're not already in there.

544
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,030
Scott: So just to make a point and all the instructions will be there.

545
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:31,490
Rym: You can't really say it's the best overall gamer because you're really constrained by the types of games you can pick with your accessibility.

546
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:36,730
Scott: So I have already selected many games and it is covering a wide variety.

547
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:39,450
Rym: So I'm just curious, are rhythm games represented?

548
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:39,633
Scott: Yes.

549
00:28:40,372 --> 00:28:40,809
Rym: All right.

550
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:45,590
Rym: In a sense, are games of physical exertion represented?

551
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:47,133
Scott: No.

552
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,330
Rym: Okay.

553
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,549
Scott: So there might be someone with no goddamn legs.

554
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:50,950
Rym: Okay.

555
00:28:51,051 --> 00:28:53,470
Rym: So this doesn't test people who are good at, for example, sport.

556
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:54,690
Scott: It is not a sport test.

557
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,330
Scott: It is only a skill game test, but many sports are also games of skill.

558
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,590
Scott: Many are, but we are not testing those.

559
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,529
Scott: We are testing the video and tabletop games.

560
00:29:05,414 --> 00:29:05,600
Rym: All right.

561
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:10,030
Rym: Are you going to require people to perhaps pirate old NES games?

562
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:22,129
Scott: That may be a requirement if they do not have some other means of playing them such as virtual console and actual old NES, a DS with a piracy card or any other number of ways to play many games.

563
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,750
Rym: Is Advance Wars one of the games?

564
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,689
Scott: Advance Wars is not one of the games.

565
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:26,429
Rym: Oh, come on.

566
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,688
Rym: Nor will it be.

567
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:28,195
Rym: Come on.

568
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,810
Rym: No, no, but there's Atari emulators.

569
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:34,530
Rym: Are there any Atari games?

570
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:44,082
Scott: The problem with representing kaboom considered a similar kaboom game is that people do not have paddles and this would exclude all non paddle owners.

571
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:45,206
Rym: is co-op one of the games?

572
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:50,868
Scott: co-op was a thought that crossed my mind because I'm good at co-op, but it is not co-op.

573
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:51,949
Scott: co-op is not a game.

574
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,110
Scott: And this is what end the guessing portion of our program received to the geek size portion.

575
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,190
Rym: So I have been waiting.

576
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,490
Rym: I'm not even joking.

577
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,970
Rym: This isn't hyperbole by any stretch.

578
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,749
Rym: I've been waiting for augmented reality since I was four or five years old.

579
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:11,030
Scott: I've been waiting for augmented reality since I was negative 10.

580
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,788
Rym: So that's hyperbole.

581
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:13,130
Rym: No, seriously.

582
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,390
Rym: My parents were gamers.

583
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,090
Rym: I was born to a family that was playing Atari.

584
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,330
Scott: This is not hyperbole or a joke or an exaggeration.

585
00:30:19,471 --> 00:30:23,010
Scott: When I was in the womb, my mom was playing super breakout.

586
00:30:23,412 --> 00:30:28,284
Rym: In fact, my mom tells stories of she couldn't lean over towards the end of her pregnancy with me.

587
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,510
Rym: So remember the Atari 2,600 has those top switches.

588
00:30:31,912 --> 00:30:34,370
Rym: She would reach over with her foot to reset the game.

589
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,250
Scott: What game was she playing?

590
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,710
Rym: Uh, she was playing outlaw breakout, uh, dig dug.

591
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:47,230
Scott: So me and Rym, we had this, uh, cutie marks on a grain boom destiny as our moms were playing breakout turning us into ribbon Scott.

592
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:47,561
Scott: Yup.

593
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:49,510
Rym: Now my mom also had the Intellivision.

594
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,050
Scott: Actually, my mom only played super break.

595
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:57,310
Rym: My grandma actually kept the Intellivision and she played burger time my entire life.

596
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:57,768
Scott: Okay.

597
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:06,250
Rym: So, uh, as soon as I was old enough to kind of recognize the world existed, I was already playing like, I like, you know, Scott had his anecdote.

598
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,230
Rym: He became sentient in the course of color.

599
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,110
Rym: One day you realized color inside the lines.

600
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:20,250
Scott: Everyone kept saying colors had lines, but I kept not doing it until one day it was like, Oh, my moment like that was playing, was playing the Atari.

601
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,369
Rym: I was playing, I think kaboom.

602
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,410
Rym: No, it wasn't kaboom.

603
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,470
Rym: I don't even remember what game it was.

604
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:30,082
Rym: I was playing the Atari, just kind of around and suddenly I'm like, Oh, I want that score to go up.

605
00:31:30,753 --> 00:31:32,790
Scott: Oh, mine, mine was, I was playing shitty.

606
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,597
Scott: I was playing shitty Atari Pac-Man.

607
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:38,007
Scott: and I was like, Oh, Pac-Man's supposed to eat all the dots.

608
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:39,627
Scott: All of them.

609
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:41,490
Scott: Oh, I'm just walking around.

610
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:46,350
Rym: So shortly after that time I had to get glasses because you know, I've got broken eyes.

611
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,209
Scott: I didn't have that problem.

612
00:31:47,611 --> 00:31:56,410
Rym: And soon as I got my glasses, the first thing I thought was, why can't I have a heads up display like fighter jets have in my glasses?

613
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,729
Rym: I asked my parents and they said, that's not a thing.

614
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:00,689
Rym: And I was really pissed off.

615
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:07,569
Rym: And I have fantasized and dreamed about having a heads up display in my glasses for almost my entire life.

616
00:32:08,111 --> 00:32:16,750
Scott: I've generally fantasized about some sort of, you know, actual cyberpunk future ever since reading Shadowrun rules.

617
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:21,209
Scott: Actually, you know, I didn't see Ghost in the Shell till like high school early ish.

618
00:32:21,395 --> 00:32:21,610
Scott: Right.

619
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:31,330
Scott: So I'm going to have to say reading Spider-Man 2099 when I was in middle school, which is totally in the cyberpunk universe and has all sorts of shit like that.

620
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:38,610
Rym: I learned about cyberpunk when I picked up at the role playing game store, when I was buying some Dungeons and Dragons crap, I was like Shadowrun.

621
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,560
Rym: In fact, you know what I think I'm going to go and I pull out Shadowrun and I flip it open.

622
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:48,310
Rym: And I'm like, wait a minute, computer hackers and dragons in the same game.

623
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,046
Rym: What?

624
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:50,288
Rym: What is this?

625
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:50,902
Rym: And I bought it.

626
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:51,829
Scott: Definitely.

627
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,070
Scott: I should reread Spider-Man 2099.

628
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,630
Scott: And people don't know that was pretty much the comic book I grew up with.

629
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:02,070
Scott: Like I would go to the comic store and I'd buy two comics, Spider-Man 2099 and Adjectiveless X-Men.

630
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:03,089
Scott: And those are my two books.

631
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,474
Scott: Spider-Man 2099 is so good.

632
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:07,866
Scott: People don't know.

633
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,510
Rym: I was more Adjective X-Men like uncanny.

634
00:33:11,682 --> 00:33:11,850
Scott: Yeah.

635
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:13,069
Scott: I read the Adjectiveless.

636
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,001
Scott: But yeah, you should read if you can get.

637
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:17,690
Scott: I think there's a trade now you can get.

638
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:20,509
Scott: It's a really good cyberpunk book.

639
00:33:22,091 --> 00:33:23,417
Scott: You know, the guy it's.

640
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,244
Scott: if you read that, you will know.

641
00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:27,860
Scott: you will say, oh, I see why Scott likes this book anyway.

642
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:36,150
Rym: The point is that we've both been waiting for augmented reality, cybernetic eyes, all those things, anything forever.

643
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:44,709
Scott: The only difference between me and Rym is that Rym is first in line for, you know, replacement body parts where I'm like second in line.

644
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,329
Scott: I'm not first in line for brain.

645
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,850
Scott: I'll watch the first guy get the robot body and if that works out, I'll get a robot body.

646
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,970
Scott: If I hear screams, I'll let another guy go in front of me in line and I'll let people have cuts until it goes well.

647
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:04,250
Rym: I'm mostly hoping holding out for a robot knees, robot hip, robot eyeballs, robot teeth.

648
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,938
Scott: I just want to have maybe I can get.

649
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:09,789
Rym: those are the parts of my body that are most likely to break before my brain breaks.

650
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:11,409
Scott: I'll take the robot teeth.

651
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:17,349
Scott: Robot eyes are not bad necessarily, but I don't really have to look like bottle eyes.

652
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,322
Scott: I don't think that's like demon eyes.

653
00:34:20,574 --> 00:34:21,027
Rym: That'd be cool.

654
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:28,429
Scott: Mostly it's like, you know, when my shit, my shit's working pretty well right now, but you know, if I had some robot arms, I bet I could do pushups.

655
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:45,810
Rym: So the reason we bring this up now is that I've realized something kind of surprising in the last week because you realize, I hope you realize it's all we've been talking about for a while now, at least in our normal lives, that Google glass has been, you know, on the horizon for a long time.

656
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:48,550
Rym: We've kind of foreseen this coming and now it's really close.

657
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:48,991
Scott: So

658
00:34:49,130 --> 00:35:01,518
Rym: now they have announced that if you submit an application, a 50 word essay, up to five photos and up to 15 seconds of video, they're going to select 8,000 people who aren't Google employees to get access

659
00:35:01,658 --> 00:35:03,624
Scott: to be in the Explorer program

660
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:10,503
Rym: who have the privilege of paying $1,500 for Google glass and get access to it in the really near future

661
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:13,484
Scott: as in weeks, if not a month or two.

662
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:13,950
Scott: Yeah.

663
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:15,529
Rym: Like I could have it by packs.

664
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:18,390
Rym: I think there's only two more days left in the applications.

665
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,070
Rym: Like it's correct.

666
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:19,464
Rym: Quick.

667
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:19,844
Rym: Yup.

668
00:35:20,113 --> 00:35:20,930
Rym: I saw the announcement.

669
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,590
Rym: I went home that night and started editing my video together.

670
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:24,689
Scott: I did the same thing.

671
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:29,409
Scott: I submitted a quick one, a quick and dirty one, and then I went and put together a really good one and then that was it.

672
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,770
Scott: I'm not going to do a third application.

673
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:55,030
Rym: Now I'm not so much surprised by sour grapes or people who don't understand like where this could go and where it could come from and why we're so excited about it, but what I'm surprised by is the lack of vision that most people I talk to have about the potential of augmented reality in general, not Google glass specifically, not the immediate physical technology now, but the potential, the idea.

674
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:58,330
Rym: I mentioned something in my Tumblr, but like, yeah, why don't I take my friends?

675
00:35:58,431 --> 00:35:59,869
Rym: I never lose track of people's names again.

676
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,629
Rym: And I get a lot of people who responded like, wow, that's an amazing idea.

677
00:36:05,336 --> 00:36:05,829
Scott: It's just weird.

678
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:19,410
Scott: I always have this weird thing too, where it's like, I'm somebody who, you know, I know that in order to make it, you know, really successfully, at least depending on how you define that in this world, the key is executing and working for a long time and keep working on stuff.

679
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,350
Scott: And I'm lazy and I got enough, so I don't do that.

680
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:26,810
Scott: But what I do have is fuck tons of ideas and I just have ideas all over the fucking place.

681
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:30,070
Scott: And I see online, there's like people who are like, I got no ideas.

682
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,110
Scott: And I'm like, what do you mean?

683
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:31,870
Scott: You got no ideas.

684
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,590
Scott: They're like no imagination whatsoever.

685
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,710
Scott: It's like, they seem to not.

686
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:45,510
Scott: And it's, I can't really like, I know for a fact there are people who lack imagination, but I don't grok like, what is it like to not have an imagination?

687
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,410
Scott: What the hell is your brain doing all the time?

688
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,882
Scott: My brain is coming up with shit and things at once and imagining things that don't exist now.

689
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,730
Rym: I wasn't planning on going down the road of making all you people feel bad.

690
00:36:56,177 --> 00:36:56,788
Rym: Like Scott is.

691
00:36:57,052 --> 00:36:58,230
Scott: How am I making people feel bad?

692
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,870
Rym: I just want to.

693
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,510
Rym: So basically I threw together this list.

694
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,985
Rym: I was like, all right, here's 20 in five minutes.

695
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,890
Rym: Like here's 20 things that'll change the world with like a thousand things.

696
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,688
Rym: But I came up with 20 just like that.

697
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:26,589
Rym: And I realized looking around the internet that when it comes to Google and augmented reality, the vast, vast, overwhelming majority of the discussions are around videoing stuff from the perspective of your eyeball.

698
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,550
Scott: It's like, I can have a GoPro in my head and do that.

699
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,170
Rym: It's like that is what most people are fixated on.

700
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:35,829
Rym: Like they don't even, they, they're looking at the non and they're thinking, well, I can put any food in that.

701
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:38,390
Rym: They're not even thinking about the non taco.

702
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,130
Rym: They're not even conceiving of putting ham in the non.

703
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:48,609
Scott: They just watch the video of Google Glass, saw what it already does, and I guess they can't imagine it doing anything else.

704
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:55,690
Scott: Whereas I imagine Ghost in the Shell because, and it's not even imagining, it's like Ghost in the Shell, Masamune, Shiro, imagine that shit.

705
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:03,069
Scott: And so did the people at a production IG and I'm just saying, Hey, I could have that shit that other guy imagined for reals.

706
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:07,569
Rym: So I made a statement and a lot of people took surprising umbrage with it.

707
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:13,850
Rym: That augmented reality as a concept is going to change the world in the near term.

708
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,050
Rym: I'm talking in the next five, 10 years, not in the next 30.

709
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:17,450
Scott: Absolutely.

710
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,470
Rym: More than the last 10 years of development of the internet.

711
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:22,409
Scott: Maybe.

712
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:33,290
Rym: And I'm pretty confident in that augmented reality has potential to radically change social structures in ways that I think a lot of people really aren't grokking.

713
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:42,722
Scott: Uh, pretty much the people who can see the extra world, uh, as they walk around are going to be separated from the people who can't.

714
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:42,983
Rym: even

715
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:47,539
Scott: more so, I mean, look at how culturally separated internet people are from not

716
00:38:47,619 --> 00:39:06,230
Rym: listening to a conversation on a ski lift where I was trapped with a guy who was quiet and two girls, they were like 25, let's say they had the most vapid, inane, stereotypical conversation about waterproof, mascara and boys you could ever imagine.

717
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:09,750
Rym: But in the middle of this, they both have iPhones out the whole time.

718
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:10,948
Rym: I don't know what they were doing with them.

719
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:14,328
Rym: And at one point service on the mountain, like 4g.

720
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:15,067
Rym: It's awesome.

721
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:15,509
Scott: Nice.

722
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:17,170
Rym: And this one girl just stops.

723
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,250
Rym: She's like, Oh my God.

724
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,327
Rym: So if you heard of this Harlem shake thing, then it was like, no, what is it?

725
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:23,330
Rym: And they start talking.

726
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,650
Rym: This girl doesn't even know what the Harlem is.

727
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,129
Rym: She starts describing it and she's just wrong.

728
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:32,530
Rym: She's like, Oh my God, it's like this dance that these hockey players did.

729
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:36,166
Rym: And then it like spread around the YouTube and it got like 5,000 likes.

730
00:39:37,212 --> 00:39:39,390
Rym: And now it's like this huge thing all over the world.

731
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:45,948
Rym: It's going to be bigger than PSI and, and they didn't like, they, they're talking about a thing.

732
00:39:46,711 --> 00:39:51,770
Rym: They have in their hands, the ability to look up immediately in real time.

733
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:52,788
Rym: What that thing is.

734
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,330
Rym: And instead the first girl makes shit up about it.

735
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,866
Rym: And the second girl believes her cause she's never heard of it.

736
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:03,203
Rym: If Scott and I have Google glass on, I say Harlem shake.

737
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:20,890
Scott: Scott's glass is already showing and it's reading it into the headphone in my ear and eventually, but hopefully before I, at the time when I am dead, it will insert the information into my brain, through some sort of cable into my spine, Allah, the matrix.

738
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:21,987
Scott: I know Kung Fu.

739
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:31,370
Rym: I mean already with just smartphones, arguments among people with smartphones are literally, Hey, why did cockroaches die upside down in the old days?

740
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:36,270
Rym: We debated for awhile and then forget, or we'd go home and look it up and then have another argument.

741
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,388
Scott: We need to go to a library.

742
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,210
Rym: Then the question is asked, everyone pulls out their phone.

743
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,070
Rym: There's two minutes of research and then we just don't talk anymore cause we all looked up the answer with Google glass.

744
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,907
Scott: It's even faster.

745
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,970
Scott: Someone says cockroach dying.

746
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,350
Scott: The page already shows up on my eyes.

747
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:58,810
Scott: I've already read it while they're talking and I say, no, you're and everyone else who has these simultaneously reads the same thing and we don't need to say anything.

748
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:01,450
Scott: And then the one person who doesn't have them is the dumb person.

749
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,250
Rym: You realize the future of augmented reality.

750
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:09,090
Rym: I walk into a restaurant and I look at the menu and immediately metadata is hovering in front of every menu.

751
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,490
Scott: I walk into a restaurant.

752
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,370
Scott: I, you know, as I'm walking to it, the menu is on my glasses.

753
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:16,450
Scott: The room is being reserved.

754
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:19,390
Scott: As I'm looking at the menu, I order the food.

755
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:24,290
Scott: I walk in my table has my name digitally floating above my seat.

756
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:27,969
Scott: I sit in the seat that already had my name floating above it.

757
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:36,909
Rym: The waiter saw I was on my way and is already standing there to make sure my order was correct, He sees the name Scott above me and where I'm going to sit.

758
00:41:37,212 --> 00:41:39,110
Scott: It alerts him that I've arrived.

759
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,330
Scott: He brings the food to me as I am sitting down.

760
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,970
Scott: I eat it immediately.

761
00:41:44,431 --> 00:41:51,330
Scott: I walk out without paying because it's automatically digitally paid when I stand up the burger.

762
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:56,728
Scott: When it comes out, he sees in his eyeballs the amount Scott tipped him and he knows that I'm a good guy.

763
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,930
Scott: And he says, thanks, Scott.

764
00:41:58,111 --> 00:42:05,150
Scott: As I leave the restaurant, looking at the map of the way to get back to wherever I'm going, I'm walking down the street.

765
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:10,104
Rym: And if there's someone I know nearby, I see a flag off in the distance showing where they are.

766
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:12,649
Rym: If I put them on my list of people I care to see.

767
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:18,250
Rym: If I meet a bunch of strangers at a party, all my metadata links up with all my friends'.

768
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:25,970
Rym: So if someone's there that Scott knows that I don't and we share data, their name, I've never met this person, hovers over their head.

769
00:42:26,312 --> 00:42:28,910
Rym: And the flags that Scott has put on them like this is a good guy.

770
00:42:29,052 --> 00:42:29,990
Rym: This is a douchebag.

771
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:31,689
Rym: This is a Randy Woo-Woo guy.

772
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:32,890
Rym: I tag people.

773
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:33,689
Rym: He tags people.

774
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,409
Rym: I know to avoid this guy because Scott's already flagged him as an idiot.

775
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:44,990
Scott: I flagged someone and then when I see someone familiar in another setting, I wonder, is that the same person that I saw in this other context?

776
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,029
Scott: And I'll have 100 percent confirmation because they're either...

777
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,650
Rym: Glasses, when have I met this person before?

778
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,210
Rym: Glasses, who is the third person from the left on that panel I'm watching?

779
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:58,170
Rym: This is just like and this is just like the baby stuff.

780
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:09,450
Scott: I go to a convention, the map of the convention, I can just see on my glasses and it'll give me a little grand theft auto arrow showing me to get to the thing that I have chosen to next on my schedule.

781
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,905
Rym: I'm playing paintball and my ammo counter shows up in my HUD.

782
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:17,289
Scott: like when I'm playing counter I'm in the gigantic tabletop room and I can't find my friends, oh there they are.

783
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:20,609
Scott: I go to the stadium and I want to find my seat, oh there it is.

784
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:33,189
Rym: I'm playing poker with my friends, my glasses are on all the time, keeping a perfect count of all the cards that have been shown based on the number of decks that were shuffled, giving me odds of everything calculated from all the information I could possibly see.

785
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,648
Scott: I walk up to the casino, they look at me and they see a big skull above my head and don't let me in.

786
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:46,670
Rym: On the off chance that I'm looking at the board and someone leans forward for a second and their cards are visible to glass, it immediately catalogs them and shows me their hand.

787
00:43:47,033 --> 00:43:47,101
Scott: Yep.

788
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,790
Rym: That might be cheating, but that's what it'll do.

789
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:50,990
Scott: Don't show me your cards, asshole.

790
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,289
Rym: Yeah, but that's what it'll do.

791
00:43:52,651 --> 00:43:54,970
Scott: I'm playing a game, there aren't even any cards.

792
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,670
Scott: Me and Rym sit down at an empty table with no dice, no cards, no nothing.

793
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:00,209
Scott: We just look at each other.

794
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,770
Scott: All of the same things appear to us digitally, there's no way he can look at my hand, right?

795
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:16,730
Scott: I touch parts of the table, glass sees where I'm touching and knows what card is supposed to be there or what piece is supposed to be there and, you know, I can just tell it, okay, I choose captain.

796
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:20,190
Scott: And he goes, which one do you want to sell the corn?

797
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,008
Scott: It sells the corn.

798
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:22,850
Scott: I see corns moving around.

799
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:28,249
Rym: I'm in a bar or at a concert and a song starts to play and it immediately just kind of flashes the name of the song.

800
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:31,429
Rym: And records a history, Latitude records everywhere I go.

801
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,069
Rym: This records a history of every song I've ever heard and where I heard it.

802
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,230
Rym: In case I think back a week later, what was that song I heard at that club?

803
00:44:38,351 --> 00:44:38,480
Rym: Bam!

804
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:47,770
Scott: I walk around the store looking at products and the Amazon prices with little A smiley logos next to them are shown hovering above every product in the store.

805
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:52,650
Scott: And if I want one of them, I look at it and I say, buy that and it orders on Amazon and sends it to my house.

806
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:57,329
Rym: Every non-English word I ever see is immediately translated for me as I look at it.

807
00:44:58,694 --> 00:44:58,926
Scott: Okay.

808
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,550
Rym: Scott and I are playing a board game.

809
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:08,369
Rym: We see sideband communication between each other and can use that to hustle the non-cybernetic douche bags at the table.

810
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,890
Scott: Oh, we can see, yeah, I can ghost in the shell, right?

811
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:14,390
Scott: The secret encrypted communications just between two people.

812
00:45:14,732 --> 00:45:14,799
Rym: Yep.

813
00:45:15,437 --> 00:45:15,727
Rym: Oh yeah.

814
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:19,690
Rym: Playing my trumpet, there's cheap music just scrolling, never have to flip the page again.

815
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,870
Scott: And you think, wait a minute, how are they going to communicate?

816
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,970
Scott: They still have to talk, but what if I have eye tracking and Dasher?

817
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:32,490
Scott: If you don't know what Dasher is, you should look that up, especially if you have no arms or legs, because it lets you type really quickly if you have no arms or legs.

818
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:39,210
Rym: What if I also have, in addition to all this, a personal cloud where I have a wristwatch that has a screen on it for data input.

819
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:44,569
Rym: And I have gloves on that do gestures and I have a pad in my pocket and I have a pad on the glass.

820
00:45:44,752 --> 00:45:46,590
Rym: So I have all these input IO mechanisms.

821
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:48,090
Scott: You don't need anything but the glass.

822
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:51,890
Scott: That's the whole point though, because if it has a camera, it can see where your hands are and what they're doing.

823
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:59,889
Scott: So you don't need gloves and you don't need a wristwatch because if you have the glass, you look at your wrist and look, there's something there on your wrist, even though there isn't actually a watch.

824
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:05,910
Rym: There is a use case for the occasional sort of second order physical interface.

825
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:11,330
Rym: And the example I'll give you rather than a real world example is from a diamond age.

826
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:12,609
Rym: Remember the beginning of diamond age?

827
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:13,087
Scott: A book.

828
00:46:13,611 --> 00:46:15,089
Rym: The guy who has the forehead gun?

829
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,129
Scott: No.

830
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,489
Rym: The first guy you meet is the dude with the forehead gun.

831
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:18,849
Scott: Okay.

832
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:27,268
Rym: So they might get clear that he could just control it with a thought, but then it would probably just fire kind of randomly every now and then.

833
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,090
Rym: So instead it's tied to a physical action.

834
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:44,049
Scott: I mean, if something is as important as say the nuclear laws, you need to have the two keys no matter how tight under his breath to actually fire it while simultaneously doing the brain trigger.

835
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:50,554
Rym: So I could see a situation where you would want a screen on your wrist that you can touch physically.

836
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:53,810
Scott: for my head mounted gun or something like that.

837
00:46:54,293 --> 00:46:56,970
Rym: Now, imagine this, you have a thing on your wrist, right?

838
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:00,590
Rym: That is the physical input device in case you do need fine control of something.

839
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:03,330
Rym: But that isn't actually a display.

840
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:06,870
Rym: That's just a surface for you to physically touch.

841
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:11,888
Rym: That also has maybe advanced sensors for fine control, but the display is still overlaid from your glasses.

842
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:16,070
Scott: The glass has a touch screen and a touch surface and a button on the side of it.

843
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:16,929
Scott: So yeah, I know.

844
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:17,288
Rym: Yeah.

845
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,719
Rym: I'm saying there's a case for all these are.

846
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:22,430
Rym: is IO devices in a cloud around your body.

847
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:23,070
Rym: Highly.

848
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,850
Scott: Well, the personal area network has been around for a long time since it was invented.

849
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,249
Rym: Yes, but it hasn't been a decade ago.

850
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,090
Scott: Well, there just haven't been enough devices for that.

851
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:37,450
Scott: It's like they've made all this stuff and they just haven't made enough devices to, you know, the pebble watch is like the first one really.

852
00:47:37,736 --> 00:47:38,010
Scott: Yeah.

853
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:46,110
Scott: Well, I think I before then, personal area networks are pretty much just wireless Bluetooth headphones, a cell phone and a laptop.

854
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:52,049
Rym: And I think the problem was just that material science, battery technology and wireless transmission technology just weren't there yet.

855
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,028
Rym: We're just at the point where they're there.

856
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:07,490
Rym: But the point is that augmented reality, like each one of these things completely on its own sounds like something that's a cool toy that is great and really awesome, but doesn't sound individually all that society shattering.

857
00:48:08,698 --> 00:48:09,168
Rym: They aren't.

858
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:16,869
Rym: None of them are by themselves, but the sum of all of them together means that I have a, I basically have a new sense.

859
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:23,090
Rym: That sense is a constant stream of metadata about everything I am ever interacting with.

860
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:28,408
Rym: I will never have a, in the future, I will never have a question about a thing I'm interacting with again.

861
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,490
Rym: I mean, in New York city, here's a really common problem.

862
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:34,369
Rym: You're walking down the street, you know, an address you want to get to.

863
00:48:35,011 --> 00:48:40,190
Scott: So yeah, maybe you have Google, you know, whatever, but the numbers on the side of the buildings are not visible often.

864
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:42,266
Scott: So I want to go to two, two, three, where the hell's?

865
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:42,750
Scott: two, two, three.

866
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,169
Scott: I know this side of the street is odd.

867
00:48:44,551 --> 00:48:53,988
Rym: Here's two, two, oh, and there's two, two, six, two to, oh, the next building is one that happens to me a lot.

868
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:55,990
Scott: I don't know where you're going.

869
00:48:56,551 --> 00:49:02,684
Rym: A lot of places downtown or maybe on the corners because you're on it now in the middle, because there's, for example, there's 60 East 42nd street.

870
00:49:04,212 --> 00:49:06,709
Rym: That is also one grand central place.

871
00:49:07,772 --> 00:49:10,590
Rym: The place augmentation is bullshit anyway.

872
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:10,950
Scott: That's right.

873
00:49:10,971 --> 00:49:11,550
Scott: It's on a corner.

874
00:49:11,691 --> 00:49:12,250
Scott: It's on two streets.

875
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,370
Rym: No, it's not on a corner.

876
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:14,110
Rym: That's the problem.

877
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:15,190
Rym: It's just bullshit anyway.

878
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,947
Rym: So yeah, I'll just overlay those numbers.

879
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,290
Scott: There you go.

880
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,009
Scott: Problem solved.

881
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:38,609
Rym: But all these things together mean that the people who use augmented reality and double down on it, and especially the people who grow up with it are going to be more different than people who don't engage with that technology than the current difference between people who use smartphones heavily and people who don't own them.

882
00:49:39,832 --> 00:49:50,709
Rym: And think about, I mean, you all who have smartphones, no people, probably parents, grandparents who don't have smartphones or maybe not even cell phones, maybe not even computers or internet.

883
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:54,670
Rym: Think about how hard it is to communicate with those people.

884
00:49:55,171 --> 00:50:00,610
Rym: Think about how many things you cannot assume when you talk to them and think about, right?

885
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:02,510
Scott: See, even if you do have these things, right?

886
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,170
Scott: Think about rims girls on the ski lift.

887
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,690
Scott: They had iPhones, but they just didn't know how to use them well.

888
00:50:07,878 --> 00:50:08,110
Scott: Right.

889
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:17,010
Scott: Well, even though I'm the kind of person where I can learn how to use it really well, having it earlier just means I have more practice sooner.

890
00:50:17,151 --> 00:50:21,050
Scott: I'll be better sooner and farther ahead sooner, you know?

891
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:31,750
Scott: And it's like if I had to choose which people I want to be in the same group with, it's the people who are awesome, not the people who don't know what a Harlem Shake is three weeks after it's over already.

892
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:42,009
Rym: I have the entire internet at my disposal, but I also have to physically think I'm going to look that thing up and go through the motions and usually I'm not at leisure to do that.

893
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,510
Rym: I'm walking somewhere, I'm interacting with something else.

894
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:54,810
Rym: Just having that information all queued up and setting my level of what metadata do I want in different contexts means that it's like I'm a superhuman with a perfect memory.

895
00:50:56,111 --> 00:51:06,350
Rym: There is the obvious drawback that if my data stream suddenly becomes unavailable, it's like not having a sense, but I already experienced that when I don't have my cell phone on me.

896
00:51:06,452 --> 00:51:06,869
Scott: That's right.

897
00:51:07,552 --> 00:51:09,829
Rym: So I don't, I think I'll be able to deal with it.

898
00:51:10,312 --> 00:51:12,670
Scott: If there's an apocalypse, there's an apocalypse, right?

899
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:19,930
Scott: I'm not going to, it's like the dumbest argument people make is like, what if the worst thing happens and you don't have it anymore?

900
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:22,969
Scott: It's like, well, I'm doing just fine now without it.

901
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:28,528
Scott: And it's like, so because I might not have, I might lose it, I shouldn't have it while I can.

902
00:51:28,831 --> 00:51:32,270
Scott: It's like, well, there might not be any more bananas ever.

903
00:51:32,552 --> 00:51:34,389
Scott: So I don't eat any bananas now.

904
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:35,330
Scott: So here's one thing.

905
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:43,170
Rym: And you could argue it's possible that someone who has access to technology like this from birth would never actually learn how to remember anything.

906
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:47,529
Rym: So then if their glasses break, they don't know how to get home.

907
00:51:48,378 --> 00:51:48,610
Scott: Okay.

908
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:49,465
Rym: That can happen.

909
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:52,310
Scott: It's possible.

910
00:51:52,450 --> 00:52:00,090
Scott: And I find it unlikely because you consider something like, you know, if you, in a, in a, in a mid future, I don't see it as being that unlikely.

911
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,650
Scott: I don't see, here's why I don't see it as likely ever, right?

912
00:52:02,951 --> 00:52:04,830
Scott: Look at just the way the human brain works.

913
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,730
Scott: You play a game like, uh, say super Metroid, right?

914
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:12,270
Scott: And super Metroid, they started to introduce the map, right?

915
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,050
Scott: Showing you where you were in the game before.

916
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:17,769
Scott: Then you were lucky if you had a Zelda one map, if any map at all, right?

917
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:23,730
Scott: But yet, even though you had the map helping you in super Metroid, you covered this.

918
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:27,950
Scott: If you played it without a strategy guide, you covered the same ground over and over again.

919
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:28,690
Scott: Right.

920
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:33,070
Scott: And even with the map, you eventually learned that you remembered it.

921
00:52:33,452 --> 00:52:35,527
Scott: Even though you had an aid, right?

922
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,089
Scott: That was teaching you true.

923
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:42,950
Rym: But what as other, even if you played Mario three with a strategy guide, other things get similarly automated.

924
00:52:43,151 --> 00:52:46,750
Rym: So I'm also using the Google car to get everywhere.

925
00:52:47,192 --> 00:52:51,010
Rym: I don't know my own address and I never even looked out the window in the Google car.

926
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,370
Scott: Well, the Google car is driving you.

927
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,709
Scott: You're not doing the driving then.

928
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:54,902
Scott: Yes.

929
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,489
Scott: You might not know how to get to the place.

930
00:52:58,262 --> 00:52:58,388
Rym: Yup.

931
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:02,350
Scott: But anyway, but if you did the driving and had a heads up display map.

932
00:53:02,924 --> 00:53:03,130
Scott: Sure.

933
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:03,729
Scott: You might not.

934
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:09,309
Scott: You might take a while to remember the directions because the map is helping you, but eventually you won't need the map because you've done it.

935
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:09,910
Rym: But here's the thing.

936
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,183
Rym: That level of existential argument is never there.

937
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:15,850
Rym: when people make, they usually make an argument more law to use an older analogy.

938
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:24,890
Rym: When cell phones first started becoming ubiquitous, the primary complaint against them from people who didn't want them was that they don't want to be able to be gotten ahold of.

939
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,910
Rym: They don't want to be interrupted on their vacation.

940
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,790
Rym: It's like they never conceived of the fact that they could turn it off.

941
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:35,589
Rym: If I go to the beach and I'm going to go on the beach, I'll probably turn my glass off

942
00:53:36,111 --> 00:53:36,192
Scott: and

943
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,076
Rym: just lay on the beach

944
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:40,555
Scott: and let, until I get one that's installed in me and waterproof and say,

945
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:43,410
Rym: I might say, Hey, go into autistic mode for an hour.

946
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:44,069
Rym: I'm just going to chill.

947
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,628
Rym: I don't care if anyone tries to call me.

948
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:46,005
Scott: Yup.

949
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:49,770
Scott: Uh, how much time do we have left here?

950
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,130
Scott: We

951
00:53:50,151 --> 00:54:22,788
Rym: can talk for a while, but the, the, the connectedness of people who use augmented reality over the next decade is going to set them increasingly, possibly dangerously apart from everybody else because they'll have so much access to information live in real time that it will be increasingly difficult to, you're not, it's not just that you have access to the information that with a, with an augmented reality that you are using in an integrated fashion with your life, you are experiencing the world in a completely different context from other people.

952
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:31,410
Rym: And I think that is what's going to cause the great social change that suddenly you have two classes of people who are seeing a, they're actually two classes.

953
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:32,450
Scott: It's like a stretching.

954
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,350
Scott: You think of it as like a big gray scale, right?

955
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:35,329
Scott: Of the classes.

956
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:43,148
Scott: You know, when you think of economic classes, usually think of technological classes and on the one end is the earliest adopter who has the hottest shit and the other end is the caveman.

957
00:54:43,255 --> 00:54:43,450
Scott: Right.

958
00:54:43,793 --> 00:54:45,230
Scott: And you just stretch it out.

959
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:51,170
Scott: So the technological power and difference between people is, is so much greater, right?

960
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:53,770
Scott: From the, from the highest end person, lowest end person, right?

961
00:54:54,432 --> 00:55:05,133
Scott: And then at the same time, the real conflict that we're already seeing for the past 20 years and probably for the next 20 as well, is that the people at the highest end and the lowest

962
00:55:05,395 --> 00:55:07,303
Rym: end are accelerating away from each other,

963
00:55:07,384 --> 00:55:17,427
Scott: away from each other, but are also equally oppressed because the political power in the world is held by these people sort of in the middle, lower end, right?

964
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:22,750
Scott: So the people who are at the extreme low are oppressed by their lack of access to the technology.

965
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:27,645
Scott: the same way in a literate person would be oppressed right in the, you know, in even today.

966
00:55:28,142 --> 00:55:28,350
Scott: Yeah.

967
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:44,349
Scott: At the same time, the extremely high tech people are oppressed by because the people who are holding governmental and other power in the world forms of power that aren't technology power and are afraid and don't want to be owned by those people with the high technological power.

968
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:53,230
Rym: Now there is one drop, one serious drawback to augmented reality that it really does just make this digital divide a thousand times worse.

969
00:55:53,651 --> 00:56:02,590
Rym: I mean, right now we live in a world where I have a smartphone because I'm fairly well off and you know, I don't have any economic trouble and there are smart people who don't have access to that technology.

970
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,149
Rym: They're less connected to me.

971
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,649
Rym: I'm less likely to interact with them.

972
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:07,330
Rym: They don't have access to this information.

973
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,389
Rym: They live in a different world.

974
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:13,910
Rym: People one step beyond that who have economic hardship, they can't even afford basic necessities.

975
00:56:13,991 --> 00:56:16,430
Rym: Maslow's pyramid, they're even further removed.

976
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:27,189
Rym: And now among the people who have money and reasonable security and reasonable power and reasonable technology, there is now going to be a divide between the AR people and the non AR people.

977
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,470
Scott: And it's weird because like the goal, right?

978
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:36,421
Scott: One of the goals of having all this technology is to bring the world together to have just one people that not these separate countries.

979
00:56:36,462 --> 00:56:42,790
Rym: are you telling me that harsh socioeconomic realities are crushing our democratization utopia, right?

980
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:46,150
Scott: It's like we're trying to use technology to make it to where all people are people.

981
00:56:46,551 --> 00:56:50,550
Scott: You know, there's no separate countries, no separate races, no separate nonsense, right?

982
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,550
Scott: You know, globalization was just one.

983
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:53,930
Scott: You know, people are people.

984
00:56:54,051 --> 00:56:54,609
Scott: Earth is earth.

985
00:56:54,773 --> 00:56:55,065
Scott: The end.

986
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,830
Rym: I like a diamond age world where there is no physical culture.

987
00:56:57,891 --> 00:56:58,750
Rym: There's just the idea.

988
00:56:59,032 --> 00:56:59,290
Scott: Exactly.

989
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:00,150
Rym: But mental culture.

990
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:13,350
Scott: But at the same time we are, you know, if our technology progresses too quickly and isn't equally accessible to all right, we're going to end up actually separating people even if we can bring everyone together in those ways.

991
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:19,110
Scott: We'll separate people again into, you know, the advanced technological people who live in cyberspace.

992
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:27,865
Scott: So might even, you know, get as far over a long period of time to be a separate species, you know, almost, or at least the culture where it's like.

993
00:57:27,885 --> 00:57:39,410
Rym: they don't even recognize that the non technological people as being the same kind of organism, the extreme of ghosts in the shell, people who don't have cyber brains and aren't connected at all are in salt.

994
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:46,210
Rym: Like homeless people are literally invisible to a lot of normal citizens and to a lot of the societal machines.

995
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:52,729
Rym: There's a great scene in ghost in the shell where there's a bunch of hobos living inside of a factory because the machines don't even see they're there.

996
00:57:53,392 --> 00:58:00,746
Scott: Well, there's also right when the, the, when the laughing man hacked everybody so that, you know, all they could see was the laughing man icon and not his face.

997
00:58:00,887 --> 00:58:02,273
Rym: hobos are the only ones who can see.

998
00:58:02,293 --> 00:58:06,790
Scott: there are two hobos who saw his actual face because they didn't have any cyber anything.

999
00:58:07,122 --> 00:58:07,290
Rym: Yeah.

1000
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:07,463
Rym: Yeah.

1001
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,245
Rym: We're not, I'm not talking about the hacking side of this cause.

1002
00:58:10,265 --> 00:58:11,089
Rym: that could be a whole show.

1003
00:58:11,731 --> 00:58:22,650
Rym: But the point is that yes, it might be silly for someone who doesn't have 1500 bucks to throw away and who isn't willing to double down on this stuff to pay for it.

1004
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:23,710
Scott: Now I'm not arguing that.

1005
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:32,450
Scott: And it might, and it might not have all the, it's actually, I guarantee it won't have even a small percentage of all these imaginary things we have imagined right away.

1006
00:58:32,751 --> 00:58:38,550
Rym: If I was an RIT at w at the economic level, I was zero came out node car.

1007
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,809
Rym: I could not have gotten Google last.

1008
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:41,210
Rym: True.

1009
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:47,908
Rym: I would have been sad that I didn't have it, but I would not have ruined my life to get the money to get it.

1010
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:53,534
Scott: I also, but at the same time, while that is true for me as well, I would not be poo pooing it.

1011
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:56,029
Scott: I would be saying, man, I wish I could have that motherfucker.

1012
00:58:56,471 --> 00:59:01,946
Rym: It's like, I remember saying totally aside Google stock, I really wish I could buy some of this right now.

1013
00:59:02,516 --> 00:59:03,530
Scott: And here's the thing, right?

1014
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,209
Scott: You might say, okay, it'll be buggy.

1015
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:10,130
Scott: It'll let's assume worst case scenario, like one feature works and it's crazy buggy.

1016
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,329
Rym: That feature is video of everything all the time.

1017
00:59:13,732 --> 00:59:14,169
Rym: That's crazy.

1018
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:17,705
Scott: Still, it still has more features than nothing.

1019
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:20,590
Rym: It has more than zero.

1020
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:24,770
Scott: Even if one thing works, that's one thing that people who don't have it don't have.

1021
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,750
Scott: It's the first, that is one super power.

1022
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:29,750
Scott: It's like, oh no, I don't have Superman super strength.

1023
00:59:29,972 --> 00:59:31,629
Scott: I only got his laser heat.

1024
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:33,230
Rym: Well, sometimes that's bad.

1025
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:36,830
Rym: For example, oh my God, I don't have Wolverine's fast healing factor.

1026
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:44,050
Rym: I only have his claws still useful if I encounter a can that doesn't want to open.

1027
00:59:44,355 --> 00:59:44,490
Rym: Yes.

1028
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:51,749
Scott: Once man, it's that kind of, you know, those plastic twisties, they tie stuff into the package.

1029
00:59:51,950 --> 01:00:00,830
Rym: You know how many times recently I've gotten a bottle of like, or not a bottle, but like one of those, uh, special packs, like the cardboard, uh, tetra pack of like guava juice.

1030
01:00:01,132 --> 01:00:03,849
Rym: And I pull on the tab and the tab comes off and it's still sealed.

1031
01:00:05,053 --> 01:00:07,110
Rym: Oh God, that's first world problems.

1032
01:00:07,418 --> 01:00:07,689
Scott: Yeah.

1033
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:12,530
Rym: But, but the point is that, yes, it's not going to be perfect.

1034
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:13,508
Rym: I perfectly understand.

1035
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:14,850
Scott: Here's the other thing, right?

1036
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:22,590
Scott: Is even though it won't be perfect, remember these days, some people seem to have a hang up about, oh, it's still beta.

1037
01:00:22,754 --> 01:00:23,370
Scott: It's testing.

1038
01:00:23,492 --> 01:00:24,430
Scott: It's not the real deal.

1039
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:26,190
Rym: There's no, so is Google Gmail.

1040
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:26,546
Scott: Yeah.

1041
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,250
Scott: There is no such thing.

1042
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:33,430
Scott: Everything these days, there is no, you know, when something is done is arbitrary, right?

1043
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,708
Rym: You know what you could say right now?

1044
01:00:35,251 --> 01:00:37,249
Rym: Measure is on CC.

1045
01:00:37,491 --> 01:00:37,949
Scott: Exactly.

1046
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:42,090
Scott: Everything these days is done by incremental development, right?

1047
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:45,230
Scott: You put it out and it gets updates and updates and updates constantly.

1048
01:00:45,313 --> 01:00:45,789
Scott: Look at steam.

1049
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,970
Scott: It updates every other week is steam and beta.

1050
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:51,200
Rym: No, but Java and nothing is ever done because of software.

1051
01:00:54,513 --> 01:00:54,847
Scott: Updates.

1052
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:55,644
Scott: Things come out.

1053
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:58,338
Rym: Well, you know, it is done, you know, it is done.

1054
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:06,952
Rym: non Samsung Android devices, but I mean, they just get updated constantly, even though the point is that non Samsung Android devices don't.

1055
01:01:06,992 --> 01:01:12,050
Scott: the Google glass you get on the first day is going to be poop compared to the exact same thing.

1056
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,290
Scott: If you just hold onto it for a few months, it's just going to keep getting better.

1057
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:19,010
Scott: Just as you use it all the time, everything just keeps getting better constantly.

1058
01:01:19,693 --> 01:01:21,830
Scott: So better to have it earlier than later.

1059
01:01:22,032 --> 01:01:23,770
Scott: So you can always upgrade.

1060
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,770
Scott: You can, you know, I used to have an iPhone three G. Oh no.

1061
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:28,335
Scott: Now I have an iPhone.

1062
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:36,249
Rym: now in the immediate term as in say I get selected and Scott gets selected and we have these next week out of the box.

1063
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:43,308
Rym: Anytime crazy shit happens on the, on, you know, anywhere in my life, I've got a Russian dash cam of it.

1064
01:01:43,736 --> 01:01:43,948
Scott: Yup.

1065
01:01:44,312 --> 01:01:45,749
Rym: So already that's awesome.

1066
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,970
Rym: That's not $1,500 awesome, but that's awesome already.

1067
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:50,745
Rym: I don't have to.

1068
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:54,769
Scott: I might, I'm not going to get much better pictures of things cause I'm not going to be too late.

1069
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,210
Scott: Cause I had to get a camera or my phone out of my pocket.

1070
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:57,377
Rym: Yup.

1071
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:01,241
Rym: Already I'm going to have a HUD of Google map.

1072
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:07,609
Rym: when I walk out of the subway and I'm at an unfamiliar station, I don't know which way is north right away or when I'm biking in a weird place.

1073
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,649
Scott: I don't have to stop and get my phone out.

1074
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:20,046
Rym: I can just keep saying guys, if you've never biked a long distance, you still need navigation, especially if you're taking a complicated route, mounting your phone on your bike sucks ass.

1075
01:02:20,297 --> 01:02:20,466
Scott: Yup.

1076
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:25,870
Rym: And you, you know, if you think it's dangerous to keep looking at your map while you're driving, yeah, biking is a little worse.

1077
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,910
Rym: So I'm going to have a HUD of my Google directions.

1078
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:30,107
Rym: It already does that.

1079
01:02:31,053 --> 01:02:32,129
Scott: It already does that.

1080
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:34,570
Scott: I can Google search without having to get my phone out of my pocket.

1081
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:40,630
Scott: I can just say, you know, Google goggles, I can just be like, okay, glass search for upside down cockroaches.

1082
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,485
Rym: You know, Google goggles, the, uh, you know, reverse image shirts, like look up what this thing is.

1083
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:49,090
Rym: That's a thing that already works now, which is going to be integrated with my glasses.

1084
01:02:49,672 --> 01:02:57,829
Rym: I'm going to use it a lot more often and to part of being an Explorer is, you know, getting access to the SDKs and actually trying to write software for this shit.

1085
01:02:58,331 --> 01:03:03,289
Rym: And you know what, you know, if no one else does it, what my project's going to be, it's so simple.

1086
01:03:03,717 --> 01:03:04,310
Rym: It's so easy.

1087
01:03:04,634 --> 01:03:05,909
Rym: I can write software to do this.

1088
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:14,310
Rym: I just want to take a PowerPoint and see my slide previews and my talking points and the time left in my HUD.

1089
01:03:14,651 --> 01:03:22,747
Scott: Also, you know what this also already does Google hang out where the person sees what you're looking at in the hangout and you see their face or what they're looking at if they have glass.

1090
01:03:22,952 --> 01:03:23,244
Rym: Yeah.

1091
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,910
Scott: That's already on its own slowly.

1092
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,349
Scott: And that's what it does now.

1093
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:27,694
Scott: Today.

1094
01:03:28,736 --> 01:03:29,048
Scott: Oh shit.

1095
01:03:29,456 --> 01:03:29,727
Rym: Yeah.

1096
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:40,510
Rym: So I am doubling down on this because I am in a situation in my life where $1,500 is not a significant hardship.

1097
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:46,387
Rym: If $1,500 worries significant hardship to me, I probably would wait until they were generally available.

1098
01:03:47,016 --> 01:03:48,830
Scott: They still be $1,500.

1099
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:49,369
Rym: They may not be.

1100
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:52,909
Rym: The thing is, it's hard to say because the people are saying they're going to be 300 bucks.

1101
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:53,909
Rym: I don't think that.

1102
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:54,928
Scott: Not for a few years.

1103
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:55,340
Scott: Yeah.

1104
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:57,524
Scott: I mean, iPhones aren't even 300 bucks.

1105
01:04:00,191 --> 01:04:01,142
Rym: Android phone is 600 bucks.

1106
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:04,972
Scott: An unsupervised iPhone five is like 800.

1107
01:04:04,972 --> 01:04:05,344
Scott: Forget it.

1108
01:04:06,235 --> 01:04:07,248
Scott: You need a lot of monies.

1109
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:20,029
Rym: But mark my words, augmented reality is going to take the people who use it over the next five and 10 years to a surprising level of connectedness that is going to leave everyone else behind.

1110
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:26,110
Rym: And society is going to start changing in really weird ways because it's like a diffuse brain injury.

1111
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:27,870
Rym: Some people are moving faster than others.

1112
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:33,084
Rym: So suddenly within individual families and individual communities, I mean, imagine this future.

1113
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:38,790
Rym: I'm walking down the street and this is a future of three years from now, Yelp reviews are just kind of popping up over restaurants.

1114
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:41,750
Rym: I look at the one restaurant that isn't on Yelp.

1115
01:04:42,236 --> 01:04:43,008
Rym: I don't even see it.

1116
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,127
Rym: I don't even know it's there.

1117
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:45,970
Rym: It's just what's that building?

1118
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:46,389
Rym: I don't know.

1119
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:47,329
Rym: There's no name over it.

1120
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:48,165
Rym: Why would I even look there?

1121
01:04:49,491 --> 01:04:52,110
Rym: Or the secret theater shows up out of nowhere.

1122
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,310
Rym: I think that doesn't even exist except occasionally.

1123
01:04:55,631 --> 01:04:57,299
Rym: I'm really excited about this future.

1124
01:04:57,319 --> 01:04:59,990
Scott: or, you know, there could be just a door on the side of the street.

1125
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:00,948
Scott: Looks like a maintenance door.

1126
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:04,109
Scott: But anyone with glass can see that what it really is.

1127
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:04,744
Rym: Imagine.

1128
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:07,210
Scott: Imagine an arcade of awesome.

1129
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:10,650
Rym: We're talking about adults like us who want to use this stuff.

1130
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:14,210
Rym: Imagine being in middle school and have an access to this shit.

1131
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:18,789
Scott: Everyone's drawn penises in the teacher's face, but the teachers all old and crut, fuddy duddy, they don't notice.

1132
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:21,870
Rym: And they try to ban glass in the classroom, but then they probably will.

1133
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:25,947
Rym: I mean, when I went to high school, you couldn't bring a cell phone to school.

1134
01:05:26,973 --> 01:05:27,810
Scott: You can't now either.

1135
01:05:28,182 --> 01:05:28,268
Scott: No.

1136
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,610
Rym: A lot of people can bring them to school.

1137
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:30,570
Rym: They have to keep them in their lockers.

1138
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:36,990
Scott: There's a truck outside of the school downtown where if you're a kid, you go to the truck and give them like a few bucks every day.

1139
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:40,470
Scott: They hold on to your phone and you pick up the phone from the truck after school.

1140
01:05:40,551 --> 01:05:43,570
Scott: It's like a private business that just realized kids had this problem.

1141
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,450
Rym: Now, see, that's a problem.

1142
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:50,468
Rym: So schools don't let kids have cell phones in an era where that level of connectedness is a big deal.

1143
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:51,470
Scott: Yeah.

1144
01:05:51,631 --> 01:05:53,630
Scott: It's like saying, all right, people, let's teach.

1145
01:05:53,770 --> 01:06:02,449
Scott: We need to teach you how to get by and get jobs and live in this 21st century society by coming to the school where you may only caveman.

1146
01:06:03,533 --> 01:06:04,889
Scott: Here is how you hit with club.

1147
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:05,670
Scott: All right.

1148
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:07,549
Scott: Now go back to your normal everyday lives.

1149
01:06:08,412 --> 01:06:10,250
Rym: It's already like that in every other realm.

1150
01:06:10,671 --> 01:06:11,430
Rym: Social studies.

1151
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:14,330
Rym: Hey, let's learn about democracy and freedom of speech.

1152
01:06:14,951 --> 01:06:21,310
Rym: Oh, you can't write that article about the principal in the school paper and you don't get to vote on whether or not we have a school uniform.

1153
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:23,830
Scott: The hypocrisy.

1154
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:24,121
Rym: Yep.

1155
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:25,708
Scott: We don't want justice.

1156
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:26,570
Scott: We want quiet.

1157
01:06:28,932 --> 01:06:31,410
Rym: The thing is I can feel occasionally my brain.

1158
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:35,936
Rym: I'll be at like an anime con and some kids like, and a part of my brain is like, shut up.

1159
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,950
Rym: And then another part of my brain is like, you know what?

1160
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:38,347
Rym: I don't care.

1161
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:39,266
Rym: Just don't care.

1162
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:48,169
Scott: Hey, if I do a glass, I just be like, I would see who that was and give them a thumbs down and then I would, they would be muted depending on what they're doing.

1163
01:06:48,591 --> 01:06:48,902
Scott: They'd be muted.

1164
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:50,009
Scott: I wouldn't hear him anymore.

1165
01:06:50,391 --> 01:06:50,561
Rym: Yeah.

1166
01:06:51,910 --> 01:07:03,450
Rym: But this, our society is going to change in surprising, sometimes dangerous ways and augmented reality is going to rapidly faster than any of you think is going to happen, drive this.

1167
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:10,050
Scott: And the thing is, if you're not in it, it's just dangerous, more dangerous for you to not be in it right then to be in it.

1168
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:13,350
Scott: If you are able, if you're able, you really just need to get on it.

1169
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:15,108
Scott: Otherwise it's only going to hurt you.

1170
01:07:15,771 --> 01:07:23,470
Scott: Like there's a reason people are looking at each other and smiling and meanwhile, you know, your face has poo poo on it and they're making fun of you and you don't even know.

1171
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:23,928
Scott: this is going on.

1172
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:28,690
Rym: There was a recent, a relatively, that's the lightest example that Scott should watch.

1173
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:29,349
Rym: I should watch.

1174
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:31,270
Rym: I've only seen a little bit of it, but it's been highly recommended.

1175
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:40,110
Scott: It's called Denno coil and it's basically set in a, well, that's more pokemons, but if it is, yes, I should program fucking Google glass Pokemon.

1176
01:07:40,311 --> 01:07:40,541
Rym: Yeah.

1177
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,519
Scott: King following you around, you know what.

1178
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:46,369
Scott: you're walking down the street and like you just see a Bulbasaur hanging out behind that dumpster.

1179
01:07:46,531 --> 01:07:48,150
Rym: Well that's the plot of this anime.

1180
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:52,930
Rym: The anime is a really kind of realistic look at, imagine a world where kids grow up with augmented reality.

1181
01:07:53,050 --> 01:08:00,025
Rym: So every kid has his pet Pokemon and all the kids see the shared reality that no adult sees.

1182
01:08:00,571 --> 01:08:11,709
Rym: Adults can interact with that and how different those kids are culturally from the people who don't see these things and how that changes their fundamental interaction, their fundamental socialization.

1183
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:18,049
Rym: I think shows like that are a vast understatement of how much things are going to change with augmented reality.

1184
01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:22,309
Scott: So, uh, I'm going to get in on his ground floor as I possibly can.

1185
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:27,323
Rym: GeekNights Mondays might turn into the augmented reality show once we get these, if we get them.

1186
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,069
Scott: Well, I mean, eventually we, you know, who wants a podcast, right?

1187
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:35,429
Scott: We'll just sort of look at each other and everyone else who's cool, we'll just sort of know what's up and then, uh, that's it.

1188
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:36,229
Rym: I do suspect.

1189
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:38,729
Rym: Here's one thing I think, cause I watched current Google glass.

1190
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:41,729
Rym: You can kind of look up like it's not, it's not a complete overlay.

1191
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:44,490
Scott: No, it's a little, it's obviously in the top right corner, a little rectangle.

1192
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:56,209
Rym: So I suspect all of us who use them heavily are going to have a tick when we're not wearing them or every, we're constantly just looking up to the left, up to the left, up to the right, wherever it is, we're going to be looking up, yep.

1193
01:08:58,078 --> 01:08:58,488
Rym: Up to the left.

1194
01:09:00,216 --> 01:09:00,908
Rym: It is up to the left.

1195
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,050
Scott: I thought it was up to the right.

1196
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,630
Rym: No, take these glasses I'm looking at and rotate them.

1197
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:05,549
Scott: Why would you rotate them?

1198
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:06,263
Rym: I don't know.

1199
01:09:06,911 --> 01:09:10,490
Rym: Oh no, it's, it's inverted because this part's blurry and that part's not.

1200
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:11,187
Rym: It's like a tilt shift.

1201
01:09:11,974 --> 01:09:12,229
Rym: Anyway.

1202
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:15,229
Scott: I think you need to go to the eye doctor before you go to get the Google glass.

1203
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:21,290
Rym: Actually, when I was looking at mockups of if you mount them onto existing glasses, you can mount, like you can get one for either side.

1204
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:25,930
Scott: One thing I'm worried about is I have, you know, I'm a person who doesn't wear glasses, but I wear sunglasses often.

1205
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,089
Scott: You're going to lose them immediately.

1206
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:34,529
Scott: So I need to put like, I need to put them on with sunglasses, take the sunglasses off, leave the Google glass on, you know, and then put the Google glass on with the sunglasses without the sunglasses.

1207
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:36,429
Rym: Scott, welcome to the last 20 years of my life.

1208
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:39,126
Scott: But now I'm double glasses and switching.

1209
01:09:40,331 --> 01:09:41,388
Rym: Scott, double glasses.

1210
01:09:41,912 --> 01:09:42,710
Rym: That's what I have.

1211
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:45,209
Rym: I have to take off my regular glasses and put on my sunglasses.

1212
01:09:45,691 --> 01:09:47,430
Scott: But this is the thing that goes with the glasses.

1213
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:54,790
Scott: So like I'll snap the Google glass off of the sunglasses, put it on by itself, then snap it onto the sunglasses and put them both on and it's like, whatever.

1214
01:09:55,354 --> 01:09:55,990
Rym: Anyway, we'll see.

1215
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:00,190
Rym: I, I'm, I'm, I reek of effort in my attempts to get these.

1216
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:02,890
Rym: I put a lot of work and thought into my application, as did Scott.

1217
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:10,870
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1218
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:15,990
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1219
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:21,430
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1220
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:24,350
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1221
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:29,070
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1223
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:36,870
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1224
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:40,030
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
