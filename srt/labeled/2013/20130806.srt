1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,447
Rym: It's Tuesday, August 6th, 2013.

2
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:12,948
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,228 --> 00:00:13,789
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:15,091
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:20,160
Rym: We're back from PAX Australia to talk about gaming and PAX in Australia.

6
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:21,997
Scott: Good day.

7
00:00:23,822 --> 00:00:24,838
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:28,619
Rym: Yeah, it's been a while since we've done this.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:36,800
Scott: Well, let's save our, hopefully we've, you know, filled up the bins of material for us to use to get us through the next month.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,365
Scott: Oh, but then there's real packs.

11
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:38,626
Scott: Yep.

12
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:42,940
Rym: And then we're going to have even more material and then it'll be the quiet times.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,252
Scott: We have to use all the material and then New Year's.

14
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:46,700
Rym: So I was biking to work today.

15
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:49,563
Scott: Yeah, let's not.

16
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:50,185
Scott: Let's do that.

17
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:54,940
Scott: Let's talk about biking to work because the Australian material we have to save for the Thursday episode.

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,445
Rym: No, I got no bike into work.

19
00:00:56,726 --> 00:01:00,000
Scott: My bit is I got no bike into work either because my arm is fucked up.

20
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:00,984
Rym: I bike to work.

21
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:01,546
Rym: Same as always.

22
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:03,534
Scott: Now, as soon as I can bike to work.

23
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:04,438
Scott: Yeah, my arms fucked up.

24
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:04,840
Scott: Fuck this.

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,525
Rym: It's kind of weird being back in the States.

26
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:14,660
Rym: I will just say one thing, because I drove long distance in Australia and I biked around a whole bunch.

27
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:17,767
Rym: I and, you know, jaywalking constantly.

28
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:21,940
Rym: I almost rode on the left side of the road when I went to work.

29
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,980
Scott: I did not make that mistake ever.

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,391
Rym: I literally like came out and I started to go to the left side of the road.

31
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:30,140
Rym: Then my brain's like, Ram, seriously?

32
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,568
Scott: I did not make that mistake.

33
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:32,092
Scott: Really?

34
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:33,120
Scott: I think you're just making it up.

35
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:37,574
Rym: No, I actually almost did right at under the seven train and the end.

36
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:39,260
Rym: Anyway, anyway.

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,462
Rym: But yeah, we're back.

38
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:40,823
Rym: We're bad.

39
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:48,200
Rym: We missed our crazy ton of news, like the steam sale, which luckily I was able to buy games using my mobile app.

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,704
Rym: Well, the steam cell got us doubly because we had Connecticut.

41
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:54,872
Rym: So we're running everything there and then like checking our steam apps and buying things like.

42
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:59,440
Rym: I remember Civ five went on flash sale while I was doing Connecticut and stuff.

43
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,626
Rym: And I had to like get the app working to buy.

44
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:06,540
Scott: Thankfully, they seem to realize that there were people who had said five, but didn't have anything added to it.

45
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,108
Scott: So they had a special upgrade pack for five bucks.

46
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:12,740
Scott: They got you everything but the brave new world and then brave new world was on sale.

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,351
Scott: So I was able to get exactly all the things I didn't have for a very reasonable price.

48
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:20,199
Scott: Good on them for recognizing it on them.

49
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:20,780
Scott: Yeah.

50
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,225
Scott: For having that that package.

51
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:29,420
Rym: But then we're in Australia at PAX and there is this great moment where we're talking to the security guard hanging out outside of PAX.

52
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,010
Rym: And basically the guys like, yeah, steam sale.

53
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,677
Rym: You realize you should check it at like one in the morning.

54
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:36,800
Scott: I think it was three in the morning.

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,567
Scott: Yeah, because usually it updates at one p.m.

56
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:40,429
Scott: in New York.

57
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,660
Scott: And I think it updates at one like a 10 or 11 in the morning in California.

58
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:46,524
Scott: Where's yet where where valve is.

59
00:02:46,544 --> 00:02:48,309
Rym: That was the night we'd arrived in Melbourne.

60
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:52,720
Rym: So I kind of that was the moment I realized, oh shit, son, we're a long way away from home.

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,928
Rym: Yeah, it was for Australian gamers.

62
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:56,229
Rym: Check it.

63
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:00,520
Scott: They're really interesting, though, because it's like we would be finishing up like up Tuesday's almost over.

64
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,582
Scott: Oh, in New York.

65
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:03,024
Scott: Tuesday is just starting.

66
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:03,345
Scott: Yeah.

67
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:06,290
Rym: Assholes enjoy our already preused day.

68
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:06,931
Scott: Yeah.

69
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:08,074
Rym: We had this day.

70
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:09,757
Scott: You realize it's already.

71
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:11,600
Scott: it's what this is a Tuesday show, right?

72
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,364
Scott: It's already Wednesday in Australia.

73
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:17,013
Scott: I know they're already Wednesdaying, probably sleeping or about to wake up.

74
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:19,600
Scott: And we are still not done with Tuesday yet.

75
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:26,920
Rym: So of all the news we could have talked about, I mean, Dragon's Crown is having its fur both between the people mad about it.

76
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,828
Rym: I mean, fewer and fewer and people mad about being mad about it.

77
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:34,477
Rym: And people saying it's sexist and people saying it is sexist and people.

78
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:35,960
Rym: It's all over the place.

79
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,504
Rym: But I really don't care, though.

80
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:38,868
Scott: I also don't care, though.

81
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,600
Rym: The game, apparently, but I'm getting people I trust is a fun game.

82
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:45,905
Rym: I'm again, you're going to get it.

83
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:46,526
Scott: I'm again.

84
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,573
Rym: OK, but it's just really.

85
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:52,880
Scott: all the art I've seen is just hideous, whether sexist or not.

86
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,547
Scott: It's just hideous, but it's unpleasant to behold.

87
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,676
Rym: It's supposed to be hideous on purpose, which in a way.

88
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,020
Scott: Yeah, I can recognize that.

89
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,115
Scott: But I still personally, I'm not made pleasure by gazing my eyes upon it.

90
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,320
Scott: So I would not subject myself to that.

91
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:09,505
Scott: Look at two anime movies.

92
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:13,280
Rym: Sort of a Stranger was a sort of a straightforward action drama anime.

93
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,212
Rym: And then there was Skycrawlers, which was slow and repetitive and slow.

94
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,040
Scott: And neither one was displeasing to my brain.

95
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,880
Rym: Yeah, for most people, slow, long, slow, repetitive, long, repetitive and slow do not a great movie make.

96
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,045
Rym: And they find those their attention spans are small.

97
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:35,320
Scott: But that because the move that my attention span is the size of my tolerance for ugliness.

98
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,785
Rym: My point is that that movie was a perfect confluence of form and function.

99
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:48,560
Rym: It is possible that in the case of this game, the hideous art is designed to complement the hideous gameplay.

100
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:58,480
Scott: I do not trust that anyone who would create that hideous art would be simultaneously wise enough to develop the other part.

101
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,880
Rym: I would have been more likely to play it if it had looked like Penny Arcade's rendering.

102
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:05,800
Scott: That is true.

103
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:15,220
Rym: But yeah, of all the news I could talk about, there actually is something I do want to talk about because it's basically the inverse of the news I was talking about back when the Wii came out.

104
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:17,263
Rym: But in a way, it's the same news.

105
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:28,920
Rym: So turns out that even now, the Wii U is literally being outsold on a day to day basis by the Wii.

106
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:37,380
Rym: The Wii, a dead, deprecated console is selling more than Nintendo's flagship product.

107
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:37,990
Scott: Hooray!

108
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:41,109
Rym: That'll teach you a lesson.

109
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,900
Scott: I hope Nintendo learns a lesson.

110
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:44,140
Rym: I don't think they have.

111
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,220
Scott: They never will.

112
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,620
Rym: It is possible because Nintendo was not profitable and they have returned to profitability.

113
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:57,920
Rym: It is entirely possible that the majority of their return to profitability was nothing more than a currency fluctuation.

114
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,900
Scott: Though that happens when you're a foreign company.

115
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,176
Scott: Yeah.

116
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:04,612
Scott: If you live in one country and make all your money from another country, think about it.

117
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:07,220
Scott: A British pound is worth a lot of money, right?

118
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,920
Rym: I'm in that boat with my actual day job company.

119
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:21,000
Scott: We worked in India and had rupees, but we did business in the UK and all our income was pounds coming to India digitally.

120
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:23,038
Scott: We would be raking in so much.

121
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,202
Rym: Scott, I'll put it this way.

122
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:35,540
Rym: I know people who worked in the US, moved to India, continued to work for the company in the US, making their original US salary in India.

123
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:36,140
Scott: And living like kings.

124
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,270
Rym: Those people are not living like kings.

125
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,180
Rym: They are living like God kings.

126
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:40,813
Scott: God kings.

127
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:48,500
Rym: I would almost consider moving to India.

128
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,238
Scott: If it didn't smell like poop.

129
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,180
Scott: Listen, there's plenty of other places we can move and be just as God kingly.

130
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:55,897
Rym: How about Estonia?

131
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,420
Scott: Not the worst.

132
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,480
Rym: I hear there's a lot of nerdery going on in Estonia.

133
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,973
Scott: I mean, it could even be somewhere.

134
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:01,520
Scott: that's, you know.

135
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,380
Rym: How about Australia, where American dollar's weaker?

136
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:06,366
Scott: Only slightly.

137
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:07,975
Scott: It was effectively equal.

138
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,000
Scott: I didn't have to pay attention to it.

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,800
Rym: It's interesting how the dollar was slightly weaker than their dollar, but yet things cost 50% more in their own dollar.

140
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,724
Scott: But also the tax.

141
00:07:16,785 --> 00:07:17,550
Scott: Let's save it.

142
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:18,920
Scott: Save all the Australian Turk.

143
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:21,760
Rym: But I don't think Nintendo is learning their lesson.

144
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:34,220
Rym: Because what Nintendo seems to be doing is, one, the DS, which has become the 3DS, that product line is still doing fine, though I think it's still seriously getting hurt by mobile.

145
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,620
Rym: A lot of people aren't going to buy their shovelware.

146
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,860
Scott: I don't know if the 3DS is doing as well as the DS GBA, but it's still doing really fucking well.

147
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,526
Rym: But the thing is, look at what they're focusing on.

148
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:50,640
Rym: There are third-party games, they're really good, but the shovelware is not doing as well.

149
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:57,900
Rym: Because no one's going to buy $40 shovelware for the expensive 3DS when they can buy $1 shovelware from the $1 app store.

150
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,623
Scott: That's right.

151
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:00,250
Scott: I only play shovelware on my phone.

152
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,178
Scott: I don't play no shovelware on my 3DS.

153
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:11,560
Rym: Meanwhile, me, who's tired of Nintendo, Nintendo who betrayed me and all us hardcore so-called gamers, recently just bought a pile of 3DS games.

154
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,460
Rym: But I'm not going to buy the Wii U, because there's literally no game that's worthwhile on the console.

155
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,607
Scott: One positive for Nintendo.

156
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:19,640
Scott: You know those little StreetPass games?

157
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,004
Rym: Yeah, Candy Box.

158
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,572
Rym: Those games are all Candy Box.

159
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:24,080
Rym: I can't believe you're playing them.

160
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,498
Rym: You paid money to play those games.

161
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,431
Scott: The same Candy Box package for $15, right?

162
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:34,460
Scott: Do you know how much money Nintendo has made in total?

163
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:36,578
Rym: Oh, Nintendo knows.

164
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:45,820
Scott: Nintendo made, I think the number in the article I read was a total of $8 million from sales of the Candy Box package alone.

165
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,558
Rym: So, Nintendo has learned...

166
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:50,136
Scott: I might be remembering the number wrong.

167
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:50,460
Rym: Look it up.

168
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,740
Rym: This is why I'm saying Nintendo didn't learn their lesson.

169
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:00,180
Rym: Nintendo, when they moved from the GameCube, which had wonderful tech demos and experiments, that was like the height of Nintendo.

170
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:06,920
Rym: Not from a business perspective, not from any perspective, but me as a gamer wanting to play Nintendo games.

171
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,960
Scott: Just because you happened to be in an environment in which it was perfect.

172
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,260
Scott: If we were in college right now, the Wii U would actually be kind of okay.

173
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,460
Rym: Kind of okay, but it wouldn't be as good as the GameCube.

174
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,460
Scott: The Wii U would have been, if you were in college four years earlier, the Wii would have been our GameCube, right?

175
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,940
Scott: Because it would have been the multiplayer system of choice.

176
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,320
Rym: Except I think we would have used the Wii to play a lot of multiplayer GameCube games.

177
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:29,800
Scott: Possibly.

178
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,220
Rym: But that's a separate discussion.

179
00:09:31,401 --> 00:09:32,439
Scott: But there was Mario Party Wii.

180
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,700
Rym: But Nintendo moved from its previous demographics to the Blue Water strategy, the open oceans.

181
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:41,460
Rym: And they started going after these casual light markets and all these things.

182
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,440
Rym: And I don't want to try to say that casual gaming is bad, because that's a really loaded term anyway.

183
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,919
Rym: But Nintendo is still going after that kind of market and is really ignoring gamers like me.

184
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:54,039
Scott: Yeah.

185
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:59,700
Rym: So, I don't know what their future is, because that kind of- Where's our 3DS Advance Wars, bitches?

186
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,060
Rym: Yeah, well there's Fire Emblem instead, which, seriously guys, Fire Emblem- Not as good as Advance Wars.

187
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:11,700
Rym: Kind of fun, but it's just mediocre dating game coupled with Crystal Warriors.

188
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:16,420
Scott: I have a feeling the 3DS one has a little bit more dating than the previous ones did.

189
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,739
Scott: Not that the other ones didn't have it.

190
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,660
Rym: No, I've gone through emulation and looked at old, but these games are Baby's First Advance Wars.

191
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,619
Rym: Which means that the Pokemon Tactics game is Baby's First, Baby's First.

192
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,900
Scott: Baby's First.

193
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:34,039
Rym: I don't have a better way to describe it.

194
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:35,198
Scott: Anyway, yeah, Nintendo.

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,382
Rym: It's adopted.

196
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:47,500
Rym: looking so good, I feel like you need to break open the safe that has your secret backup strategy and realize that what it says in there is a monolith with the simple phrase- Pokemon MMO, bitches.

197
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,859
Scott: And also, Advance Wars.

198
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:56,180
Rym: So, I was thinking of Roanoke and I realized that the perfect comic- The island?

199
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,763
Rym: Yeah.

200
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:58,620
Rym: You know the mystery of where everyone disappeared?

201
00:10:58,681 --> 00:10:59,599
Scott: Everyone disappeared, yes.

202
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,020
Rym: And they found- So, imagine the Nintendo offices, empty.

203
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Rym: Nintendo is out of business.

204
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,600
Rym: Archaeologists come into the Nintendo headquarters.

205
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,820
Rym: They find all the abandoned Wii U's and the abandoned game consoles.

206
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:18,793
Rym: And in Miyamoto's office, they find, written on a single piece of paper, in fact carved into his desk, the words, "Pokemon

207
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:19,015
Rym: MMO.".

208
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:22,300
Scott: Anyway.

209
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:22,755
Scott: Anyway.

210
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,400
Scott: So, this is a really interesting news.

211
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:32,079
Scott: I posted it on the forum and had a discussion, but as I know, people who listen to the show aren't in the forum and people in the forum don't listen to the show.

212
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:33,239
Scott: Always funny.

213
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,178
Scott: Yeah, and it was just a really fascinating thing that happened in the gaming world, so I really want to discuss it.

214
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,539
Scott: So, here's the deal.

215
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:41,400
Scott: Fighting game community, right?

216
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:49,099
Scott: It has ups and downs, positives and negatives, but, you know, fighting games I respect as a competitive skill-based game and it's, you know, they have real competitions.

217
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,817
Scott: It's totally cool.

218
00:11:50,520 --> 00:12:04,780
Scott: There was a tournament in New York and these two guys got to the finals and in the opinion of the guy who was organizing the tournament, named Spooky, he thought that the two players getting to the finals, who were in the finals, were colluding.

219
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:06,660
Scott: Now, what were they colluding, right?

220
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,819
Scott: They were battling in the final round to see who would be the champion of this tournament and win the prize.

221
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:12,980
Scott: What could they possibly collude on?

222
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,180
Scott: That would be like the two teams in the Super Bowl.

223
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:17,160
Scott: Were they gambling?

224
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:22,080
Rym: So, the Super Bowl, it's the Lions versus the Browns.

225
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:24,160
Rym: Do they agree?

226
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,350
Scott: This is big teams.

227
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,060
Rym: Do they agree to make it a draw?

228
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,878
Scott: You can't.

229
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,357
Rym: Okay.

230
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:36,280
Rym: Do they agree to play forever in overtime, trolling their entire rest of the world?

231
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,776
Rym: They would die.

232
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,598
Rym: They could make it a while.

233
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,940
Scott: Are they allowed to bring food out for them?

234
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,140
Scott: But they both really want to win the Super Bowl, so that's not going to happen, right?

235
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,936
Scott: In this case...

236
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:44,380
Rym: Would they?

237
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,618
Rym: Because I could... All right, so here's what they could do.

238
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:48,519
Rym: If two teams got to the Super Bowl...

239
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,179
Scott: You're just dragging the show out with nonsense.

240
00:12:50,520 --> 00:13:00,280
Rym: And they agreed that they should play to a draw for as long as they possibly can, that game would go down in history, make everyone involved.

241
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,040
Scott: It would not benefit the teams.

242
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,720
Scott: The teams, they would basically call orange immediately and try to win the Super Bowl because everyone really wants to win it badly.

243
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:09,879
Scott: And only one side can win.

244
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,760
Scott: Anyways, in this case, that was not such, right?

245
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,839
Scott: These guys basically realized, huh, if I win this tournament, I get the prize money.

246
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:19,600
Scott: If I lose, I get significantly less.

247
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:24,860
Scott: If I collude with this guy, we can basically both agree to split all this prize money between us.

248
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,620
Scott: We don't care about this tournament that much.

249
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,500
Scott: It's not the Super Bowl.

250
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:28,540
Scott: It's a lesser tournament.

251
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,040
Scott: It's like a New York City tournament, right?

252
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,440
Scott: So let's agree to split the prize money.

253
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:44,420
Scott: Now, there isn't evidence that they did this, but it was suspected that they did this because apparently if you watch them play the final match, they weren't playing the characters they're really good at.

254
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,920
Scott: They were obviously not trying to win, right, with their full might.

255
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:58,880
Scott: They were, you know, it's arguable that they may have been, but most likely they were not putting forth their full effort to win and they were not putting on a good show for these spectators, right?

256
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:03,280
Scott: You know, it'd be like if you, like that badminton in the Olympics, right?

257
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,720
Scott: Except in the badminton in the Olympics, they were losing in order to win the big tournament.

258
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:12,100
Scott: Here, they were losing, or at least, you know, losing sort of on purpose.

259
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:14,180
Rym: If it's true, it's a very simple function.

260
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:15,619
Rym: And you already alluded to this.

261
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:20,620
Rym: Their utility function is the money and the lifestyle that that money supports.

262
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:31,260
Scott: Right, they would rather have half of the total prize pool for first and second than try to, you know, than risk having the second place prize, which is not enough.

263
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,878
Scott: Now note, this is only possible.

264
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,080
Scott: And don't really care about the benefit of getting the big first place prize.

265
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:42,780
Rym: This is only possible due to a combination of tournament structure and the fact that it's a competitive direct game as opposed to, say, golf.

266
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:51,880
Rym: Golf has similar prize structures, yet there is no way for two players to collude to share the top spots because they're all playing solitary.

267
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,240
Scott: Well, they're not trying to tie, right?

268
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,740
Scott: They were just basically saying, "Okay, we already know who wins.

269
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,499
Scott: We're going to just share it, so let's just stick around," right?

270
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,949
Scott: As opposed to, "Let's put

271
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:00,110
Scott: forth.".

272
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:05,840
Rym: What they have both bought from each other is security of not having to risk losing.

273
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:06,419
Scott: No.

274
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:07,160
Scott: The money.

275
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,543
Scott: No.

276
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,980
Scott: The reason that they did not put forth the full effort in winning, right?

277
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:26,459
Scott: Because it's like, "Okay, we've decided to split the money no matter what, so why not try to win and put in a show anyway, thus guaranteeing that, you know, the person who's in charge of the tournament doesn't think we've colluded and isn't going to shut it down," which he did, and that the people get a good show.

278
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,600
Scott: The reason they don't do that is because they don't want to reveal their full power, right?

279
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,638
Scott: They don't want to show off.

280
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:46,160
Scott: If they want to play to win, they actually might have to use their strongest techniques, and thus other people in the community and other places who they're going to fight in bigger, more important tournaments that they care about will see those techniques.

281
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,079
Scott: Much like if a football team had a play, a trick play that was so good, that it was going to win the game, right?

282
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:59,420
Scott: But if they used it during the regular season to win a game, then they couldn't use it in the Super Bowl later because the other team might see it coming.

283
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,829
Rym: Game theory, guys.

284
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:02,159
Rym: Everyone's as smart as you are.

285
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:02,660
Scott: Right.

286
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:14,920
Scott: So they wanted to keep basically their moves and their combos and their strategies a secret so that they would still be fresh and surprising at a more important tournament that they cared about.

287
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:18,320
Scott: A football team in the Super Bowl is going to pull out all the stops, right?

288
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,547
Scott: This was the finals.

289
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,840
Scott: People should pull out all the stops in the finals.

290
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,759
Rym: But it wasn't the final final because the Super Bowl...

291
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,280
Scott: It was the finals of this tournament, not finals of some other tournament that was more important.

292
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:38,120
Scott: So because they were both able to keep their secrets to hopefully do better in a later tournament and share the prize, they put on a shit show for the spectators.

293
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,900
Rym: Now the real reason why this is impossible, like look at baseball for example.

294
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,545
Rym: Yes, it is conceivable.

295
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:47,420
Rym: maybe someone came up with a new style of pitching that is just better in some way.

296
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,371
Scott: But you can't duplicate it by watching the guy.

297
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:50,960
Scott: You need a guy who can do it.

298
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,870
Rym: But even if you watch it, figure out, "Oh, it's

299
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,272
Rym: possible.".

300
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,700
Rym: I mean look at atomic bomb research.

301
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:57,516
Scott: Yes, we know that we know how to throw the knuckle ball.

302
00:16:57,577 --> 00:16:58,080
Scott: Guess what?

303
00:16:58,522 --> 00:17:01,020
Scott: You're going to have to practice a lot before you can throw it as well as that guy.

304
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,039
Rym: But a lot of the reason that other people were able to develop atomic weapons after the U.S.

305
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,585
Rym: did was because once the U.S.

306
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:12,026
Rym: detonated one, even though detonating it didn't tell you how they did it, it proved that it was possible.

307
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:15,960
Rym: Once you know it's possible, you know what to train, you know what to practice.

308
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,700
Scott: It's a little more obvious because you can just get the streamed video of the tournament, right?

309
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:25,059
Scott: Or a recorded video or whatever and then just watch it frame by frame and see, "Oh, I see what he did

310
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:25,200
Scott: there.".

311
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,424
Rym: So why does this never happen?

312
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:30,800
Rym: How come there hasn't been a World Series where suddenly something crazy happened?

313
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,800
Rym: Because that sport has been around for a long time and there literally are no more secrets or trick plays.

314
00:17:37,383 --> 00:17:37,780
Scott: That's true.

315
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,792
Rym: There is nothing left you can do.

316
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,040
Rym: that is novel in baseball.

317
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:41,800
Rym: That's true.

318
00:17:42,024 --> 00:17:42,799
Rym: Literally nothing.

319
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:45,436
Rym: Football, there is almost nothing you can do.

320
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:46,040
Rym: that is novel.

321
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,960
Scott: Now the reason that you can do things now, here's the thing though.

322
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:53,618
Scott: Some fighting games, there is nothing, it's Street Fighter II, there's nothing you can do.

323
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:54,080
Scott: that's novel.

324
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,739
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's all been done, right?

325
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:57,200
Scott: But they keep updating shit.

326
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,500
Scott: Street Fighter IV is actually getting another update.

327
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,640
Scott: They're making like hyper Street Fighter IV or Ultimate or some ridiculous, you know.

328
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,920
Scott: At first it was Street Fighter IV, then Arcade Edition.

329
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Scott: Now they're coming out with another update and the reason is that they're having longer and longer development times.

330
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:13,980
Scott: So Street Fighter V probably isn't going to be here for many years yet.

331
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:15,192
Scott: They're talking like 2018 or something.

332
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,920
Scott: So they're going to keep updating Street Fighter IV on the side to keep Street Fighter alive, right?

333
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,100
Scott: Keep adding characters and updating stuff with these updates that they charge money for.

334
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,580
Scott: And use that until Street Fighter V is ready.

335
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:32,160
Scott: But by adding characters, by changing things, right?

336
00:18:32,622 --> 00:18:33,720
Scott: The game keeps changing.

337
00:18:34,123 --> 00:18:35,236
Scott: There's novel things, you know.

338
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:37,299
Scott: There's so many characters now.

339
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,679
Scott: There's always something you can think up that hasn't been done before.

340
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:51,596
Scott: And the word on the street is that with this new update to Street Fighter IV, their goal is not to balance the characters by like making the top class characters weaker, but basically to make every character stronger, right?

341
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:55,880
Scott: So it's like, imagine if it was Dragon Ball, right?

342
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,240
Scott: It's like, well, Super Saiyan Goku is the strongest, right?

343
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,860
Scott: So rather than say, well, it's unfair to pick him, let's make him weaker.

344
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:04,259
Scott: It's like, no, let's make everyone else as strong as that.

345
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:07,180
Scott: And then that way we'll even the tables.

346
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:08,814
Scott: We're going to see how that turns out.

347
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:09,560
Scott: That's pretty interesting.

348
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,918
Scott: I want to see what happens.

349
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:29,480
Rym: Well, I think there's a sort of meta issue here that because this tournament system of games that are professional, you know, video games basically, where there's actually a scene around it, there's money around it, is so new and so young that the small number of people

350
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:31,920
Scott: And you might be like, oh, it's like decades old.

351
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,197
Scott: Yeah, baseball is like a century old.

352
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:35,304
Scott: Yeah.

353
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:38,820
Rym: Hockey predates good modern video technology.

354
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:40,249
Scott: Yeah.

355
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,357
Scott: American football is new.

356
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:41,740
Scott: And you know what?

357
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,779
Scott: The rules change a lot all the time.

358
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:44,166
Scott: Yep.

359
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:44,820
Scott: Right.

360
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:53,000
Rym: But all these sports also have in common that there are long standing rules bodies that have semi monopolies over these sports.

361
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,180
Scott: And that's the other important thing.

362
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,580
Scott: When you have one governing body for the whole sport, that governing body can actually control people, right?

363
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,980
Scott: It can be like, look, we're going to ban you from the sport.

364
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,380
Scott: There are no meaningful matches in this sport.

365
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:07,000
Scott: That we do not govern, but now we can kick you out.

366
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,700
Rym: If one video game league says, yeah, we're banning you because you cheated.

367
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,540
Rym: And that guy's popular.

368
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,579
Scott: You just go play in another one.

369
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:11,803
Rym: Yeah.

370
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:12,574
Rym: They're basically one.

371
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,140
Scott: It's like if we ban people from our net runner tournament for like poor sportsmanship, it's like, okay, there's a hundred other gaming stores.

372
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,440
Scott: They can go to a net runner tournament at.

373
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,418
Scott: They just can't go to that one.

374
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:21,902
Scott: Yep.

375
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:22,283
Scott: Right.

376
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,679
Rym: It's like, you know, but also these kinds of games.

377
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:29,360
Rym: Notice how there's a very small number of people in the top tier rotata.

378
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,919
Rym: That's because it takes a lot of practice and dedication to get to that point in these games.

379
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,480
Rym: And the people who have the time to do that pretty much need that to be their lifestyle.

380
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:49,320
Rym: So they literally need to win enough tournaments to fund their lives, to continue playing the game, to be good enough at it, to continue winning tournaments.

381
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,259
Rym: It's a vicious cycle.

382
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:50,677
Scott: Yep.

383
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:56,300
Rym: As a result, they can not risk losing that money stream.

384
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,140
Rym: They need a steady income from the tournament scene.

385
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:05,820
Rym: And the tournament tournament scene is too immature to provide that to more than a very small number of people.

386
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:15,260
Rym: And that small community of people all know each other really well and are actually really insular and really segregated from a lot of the rest of the gaming community.

387
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,166
Scott: You know, you think it's an.

388
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:17,800
Scott: it's an individual sport, right?

389
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:28,200
Scott: And the way individual sports like tennis and golf, the way that those work, the way that people can devote their lives to be a pro golfer, a pro tennis player is because the prize payout goes all the way down.

390
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:33,700
Scott: If you were in a PGA golf tournament and you come in like 30th place, you get thousands of dollars.

391
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,420
Rym: You've all seen Happy Gilmore, right?

392
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,159
Scott: You get tons of money for not coming in anywhere close to first place just for showing up.

393
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:40,726
Scott: Right.

394
00:21:40,828 --> 00:21:41,480
Scott: Last place.

395
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:45,220
Scott: I'm pretty sure it gets a not insignificant amount of money depending on the tournament.

396
00:21:45,643 --> 00:21:45,784
Scott: Right.

397
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:47,340
Scott: Even if it's not a major tournament.

398
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:49,166
Scott: You know, and if it's like the U.S.

399
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,811
Scott: Open, like the U.S.

400
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:53,180
Scott: Open, you know, you know, all those ones that say open on them.

401
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:55,040
Scott: It's called open because it's open.

402
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:56,359
Scott: If you're good enough, you're in.

403
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:58,031
Scott: You don't have to be you don't have to be a pro.

404
00:21:58,071 --> 00:21:59,340
Scott: You don't have to be anything special.

405
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:00,959
Scott: It's just you play into it.

406
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,980
Rym: There's also a structure of related industries that make enough money to subsidize a lot of this.

407
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,221
Rym: Yeah.

408
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:12,140
Scott: All that money comes from like golf ads, you know, and all the commercials when you watch it on TV.

409
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,266
Rym: How much money do you think?

410
00:22:14,587 --> 00:22:22,899
Rym: the vending services, hot dogs and Red Bull or whatever, and every video game tournament in America combined is compared to one football game.

411
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,362
Scott: Yep.

412
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:26,020
Rym: So there aren't these structures in place.

413
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:31,920
Rym: And basically everything we've talked about has created a kind of toxic tournament culture.

414
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:34,019
Scott: Anyway, let's move on.

415
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,058
Rym: It's an interesting story.

416
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,930
Rym: So things of the day.

417
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,860
Rym: I'm kind of excited to be able to do this again.

418
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,120
Rym: I got charged up quite a lot.

419
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,800
Scott: I can't remember what things of the days I've used, but I have a zillion of them.

420
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,320
Rym: I have saved several.

421
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,814
Rym: But the one I want to talk about now is a game in the Google Play Store.

422
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:57,520
Rym: that is now my new favorite game.

423
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,620
Rym: Send me to heaven.

424
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,285
Rym: It's an app.

425
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:01,115
Rym: You can download it.

426
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:03,560
Scott: It's in the Google Play Store.

427
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,020
Scott: So is it only for Android?

428
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,599
Rym: Supposedly only for Android.

429
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:06,943
Scott: Okay.

430
00:23:06,963 --> 00:23:07,539
Scott: I don't have Android.

431
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:17,099
Rym: So if this game, if you actually play this game and you don't need the app to play it, you can play the game without the app if you're clever or if you have a friend helping you.

432
00:23:18,283 --> 00:23:20,159
Rym: I take no responsibility if you play this game.

433
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:22,200
Rym: So send me to heaven.

434
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,080
Scott: You just kill somebody?

435
00:23:23,162 --> 00:23:23,839
Rym: It's a sport game.

436
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,640
Rym: Player is supposed to throw his phone as high as possible and catch it.

437
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,460
Scott: No, I'll throw some other phone as high as possible.

438
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,433
Rym: The app should measure the height of the phone.

439
00:23:31,473 --> 00:23:32,500
Rym: fly from the player's hand.

440
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,319
Rym: The higher, the better.

441
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,179
Rym: There's a leaderboard.

442
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,139
Scott: Nope.

443
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:37,140
Scott: I will do that.

444
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,740
Scott: I should get a phone just to play that and we'll use the water balloon slingshot or a model rocket.

445
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:46,378
Rym: I love the idea.

446
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,500
Scott: Just like a throwaway phone.

447
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:54,360
Rym: I love the idea of games like this because it's almost, it's like an art installation.

448
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,160
Rym: It's like watching someone continuously run into that first goomba over and over again.

449
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:05,318
Rym: Even if this is a joke, the, the idea of a game like this real world consequences for something minor.

450
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,000
Scott: And I'm pretty sure, how does that phone measure how high it went?

451
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,980
Scott: I think it's just a trick to get you to break your phone.

452
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:17,260
Rym: Well, I mean, my GPS actually, if I put it in a real time mode and I get a calibrated does a pretty good job of detecting elevation changes.

453
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:17,758
Scott: Really?

454
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:18,133
Scott: Yeah.

455
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:24,139
Scott: But when the GPS, so wouldn't it just be telling you the elevation of the spot on the map you're standing?

456
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,539
Rym: So if you go, no, no, it tells you the elevation of where you are.

457
00:24:27,703 --> 00:24:28,039
Rym: Really?

458
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:35,100
Rym: It's just not, it's not super accurate sometimes because it needs a lot of calibration because you really need a barometer for that shit.

459
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:43,580
Rym: The way the satellites are, it's better at your spatial two dimensional, well, two dimensional relative to your perception position.

460
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:46,040
Scott: Anyway, anyway, I think of the day.

461
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:49,219
Scott: So when I was a kid, I had He-Man toys, which were kind of cool.

462
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:51,380
Scott: I had Battle Damage, He-Man, Skeletor.

463
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:52,194
Scott: Yeah.

464
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:59,140
Scott: And one of the toys I had was, I also had both of those was Mossman and Mossman was kind of fuzzy and he smelled funny.

465
00:24:59,566 --> 00:24:59,838
Scott: Right.

466
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:02,219
Scott: And Mossman was pretty cool.

467
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:11,220
Scott: The thing is, there was another guy I did not have, and his name was Stinkor and Stinkor smelled sort of just like Mossman.

468
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:18,100
Scott: What is interesting is that if you find an old Stinkor figure today, he still stinks.

469
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,760
Scott: It's like 30 years old, this action figure.

470
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,158
Rym: That's kind of crazy.

471
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,457
Scott: Why does Stinkor still stink even though dude is 30 years old?

472
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:28,320
Scott: action figure, right?

473
00:25:28,421 --> 00:25:31,120
Scott: Usually an old toy, whatever it is, doesn't work anymore.

474
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,840
Scott: You find a Battle Damage He-Man, guess what?

475
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,900
Scott: That Battle Damage is just permanently stuck on full damage, right?

476
00:25:36,221 --> 00:25:38,820
Scott: You find like a Teddy Ruxpin, he ain't telling you any stories.

477
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:39,800
Scott: Okay.

478
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:40,700
Scott: It's just not going to happen.

479
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,040
Scott: Glow worm, no glow.

480
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:44,380
Scott: It's just, he's too old.

481
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:44,779
Scott: He's dead.

482
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:45,579
Scott: It's not going to happen.

483
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:48,300
Scott: But for some reason, Stinkor still stinks.

484
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,040
Scott: How does Stinkor still stink?

485
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,780
Scott: This is a really, really incredible article that tells you why Stinkor still stinks.

486
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,520
Scott: Basically, they put patchouli oil in the plastic.

487
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:01,300
Rym: Just like actually in the plastic.

488
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:06,020
Scott: But the rest of this article tells you all sorts of other interesting things about Stinkor.

489
00:26:06,222 --> 00:26:07,039
Scott: So you should check it out.

490
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:11,380
Rym: Stinkor is the kind of thing that you would expect to be a parody of a real toy in a movie.

491
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,640
Rym: That's the kind of thing you see an ad for in the background in Robocop.

492
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,720
Scott: Even He-Man, which was basically the sell toys garbage, right?

493
00:26:19,723 --> 00:26:22,579
Scott: The people making the show refused to put Stinkor in the show.

494
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,840
Scott: He only actually appeared, I think, in some crappy comic spinoff or something.

495
00:26:29,282 --> 00:26:32,139
Scott: They wouldn't even put him in the show because he was just too far.

496
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,900
Rym: No matter how low a man goes, he's got to have a line.

497
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,979
Rym: Even a beggar sneers at someone who's too poor to give him alms.

498
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,148
Scott: Yep, exactly.

499
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:39,491
Scott: Exactly.

500
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,959
Rym: So, in the meta moment, holy fuck, we're back.

501
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:45,980
Scott: Holy shit.

502
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,800
Rym: It's been a long time since we've done GeekNights.

503
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:51,560
Scott: And we're going to only do GeekNights for a few weeks and then go to Seattle.

504
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,098
Rym: Yep, we're going to be presenting at least one panel of PAX on Monday, Bad Games.

505
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,683
Scott: Monday?

506
00:26:57,844 --> 00:26:58,488
Scott: Is this PAX?

507
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,239
Scott: Holy shit, four days?

508
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,437
Rym: Four days of PAX.

509
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:03,540
Rym: I can hardly contain myself.

510
00:27:04,026 --> 00:27:05,059
Rym: I'm actually really excited.

511
00:27:05,902 --> 00:27:08,320
Scott: So much PAX, playing all the games.

512
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,254
Scott: This PAX is going to be dedicated to three things.

513
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,339
Scott: Number one, all four things.

514
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,697
Rym: Alright, so let's see if four things are the same thing.

515
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,459
Rym: I want to dedicate it to playing multiple games of Eclipse.

516
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:21,039
Scott: Okay.

517
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,377
Rym: Tabletop RPGs.

518
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:24,640
Rym: Hanging out with strangers.

519
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:28,520
Rym: Going to some concerts because there's additional concerts.

520
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,260
Scott: There is one extra concert because extra day.

521
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:31,663
Scott: Yeah.

522
00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:33,339
Rym: Also, I have an extra day.

523
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:38,940
Rym: And the thing is, you might think that one extra day doesn't seem like that big a deal.

524
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,019
Rym: Let me tell you something, kids.

525
00:27:40,722 --> 00:27:42,960
Rym: When we first went to MAGFest, it was four days long.

526
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,600
Rym: It felt like I was there forever.

527
00:27:46,662 --> 00:27:49,980
Rym: It felt like I walked into this place and then I walked out months afterward.

528
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,339
Rym: Somehow that extra day, because you get, at a normal con, Friday...

529
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,380
Scott: But this isn't Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

530
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,700
Scott: This is Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

531
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,261
Scott: Exactly.

532
00:27:58,341 --> 00:28:06,620
Rym: So now we're going to get the Thursday pregame, full on Friday, full on Saturday, full on Sunday, and then gimped Monday.

533
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:11,460
Rym: Usually you get half on Friday, full on Saturday, gimped Sunday.

534
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,400
Scott: Anyway, so here's what I'm going to do in this pack.

535
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,500
Scott: Number one, tabletop RPGs all the way.

536
00:28:17,902 --> 00:28:18,646
Scott: I'm going to sign up.

537
00:28:18,686 --> 00:28:20,960
Scott: I'm going to find the guys who are running the games on demand.

538
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,470
Scott: I'm going to be like, "I'm GMing.

539
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:23,196
Scott: Hook it up.

540
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:23,437
Scott: Let's

541
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:23,619
Scott: go.".

542
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:27,140
Rym: I'm going to find someone else to run Torchbearer for me because I haven't learned it yet.

543
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:27,937
Scott: I'll do it.

544
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:29,707
Scott: Two, right?

545
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:32,040
Scott: I'm going to play Netrunner, of course.

546
00:28:32,322 --> 00:28:32,899
Rym: Of course.

547
00:28:33,362 --> 00:28:33,658
Scott: Of course.

548
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,339
Scott: There's actually going to be a PAX tabletop official Netrunner tournament, but I don't know.

549
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:41,900
Scott: It was listed as doing a single elimination, which is wrong.

550
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,240
Scott: That's not a Netrunner tournament.

551
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,700
Scott: So I might have to go and volunteer to temporarily administer the tournament, see if the enforcers are down with that.

552
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,919
Scott: I'm sure they will be, right?

553
00:28:54,122 --> 00:28:56,940
Scott: Three, the regular PAX business, of course.

554
00:28:58,082 --> 00:29:01,940
Scott: And four, 3DS shit, because there's going to be Smash Bros.

555
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,879
Rym: Oh, you mean your candy box?

556
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,475
Scott: I'm pretty sure there's going to be Smash Bros.

557
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:04,758
Scott: by then.

558
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,379
Rym: So I've noticed something.

559
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:17,480
Rym: I've noticed, since the 3DS came out, a very different culture of pickup gaming that basically precludes what you're expecting to happen.

560
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:27,140
Rym: So when we first got the regular DS, you go to any con and DictoChat would be full to the point that you couldn't join.

561
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:27,920
Rym: DictoChat?

562
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,280
Rym: People were just drawing penises all over the place.

563
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:32,693
Scott: No one used a swap note.

564
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,177
Rym: You go to any panel room at any convention, even like Otakon, in the earliest days of the regular DS.

565
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:39,760
Scott: DictoChat.

566
00:29:39,962 --> 00:29:40,920
Rym: And DictoChat was just full.

567
00:29:41,461 --> 00:29:47,880
Rym: And if you just put it in looking for game mode, like look for download play, there'd be like ten games going on.

568
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:55,200
Rym: I have turned on download play in many locations since I got my 3DS, including PAX Australia.

569
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,019
Rym: Never, ever have I seen a pickup game.

570
00:29:59,342 --> 00:30:00,619
Scott: Because everyone's playing candy box?

571
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,719
Rym: Because everyone's playing candy box or they're playing single player Animal Crossing and that's it.

572
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:09,876
Scott: I think it was Smash Bros.

573
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:10,100
Scott: hits.

574
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:13,632
Rym: Nope, you're going to have to find an individual person and say, "Yo, you.

575
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:15,399
Rym: Specific

576
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:15,700
Rym: person.".

577
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,331
Scott: Man, at PAX that's going to be so hard.

578
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:18,600
Scott: I'm never going to find anybody.

579
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,738
Rym: Yeah, you're going to try to do that and you're going to say, "Sorry, I'm in the middle of Animal

580
00:30:21,758 --> 00:30:22,060
Rym: Crossing."

581
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:24,096
Rym: Or, "I'm busy with my street

582
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:24,480
Rym: passes.".

583
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:26,080
Scott: Animal Crossing is already starting to fade.

584
00:30:26,462 --> 00:30:26,878
Rym: No, it's not.

585
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,519
Rym: What are you basing that on?

586
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,119
Scott: The thread hasn't bumped in a while.

587
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,900
Rym: Oh, that's because they're all playing Animal Crossing.

588
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:35,060
Rym: There's nothing left for them to say.

589
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:36,740
Scott: Other metas.

590
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:38,535
Scott: The Book Club book is?

591
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,343
Rym: Stasi-land.

592
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:45,880
Rym: True accounts of what it was like inside of and around the Stasi.

593
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,800
Rym: You know, the secret police in East Germany during the Soviet Union and after the fall of the Berlin Wall and all that business.

594
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:54,798
Scott: You mean before the fall of the Wall?

595
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,340
Rym: Yeah, so after the fall of the Wall is when most of these stories are told or take place.

596
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:01,420
Scott: Oh, really?

597
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:06,120
Rym: Some of the stories are, yeah, this guy was in the Stasi and now he's a normal person.

598
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:06,899
Scott: Oh, okay.

599
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,157
Rym: A lot of stuff like that.

600
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:10,580
Rym: You obviously have not read the Book Club book yet.

601
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,780
Scott: No, but I thought most of the stories, while they may have been told after the fall, they happened before.

602
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:22,000
Rym: Ah, but a lot of the parts of the stories happen after and a lot of the relevant information happens after.

603
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,680
Rym: Like, there's a group of people who are basically the MRAs of bullshit secret police spying.

604
00:31:28,381 --> 00:31:33,638
Rym: Who are like, "What we did was justified and you guys are persecuting us for doing what we were supposed to be

605
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,000
Rym: doing.".

606
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:34,329
Scott: Nope.

607
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,779
Scott: We've already been through that, guys.

608
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,000
Rym: Yeah, I feel like this book is a good Book Club book.

609
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,986
Scott: In the same country.

610
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:42,060
Scott: We've been through this in the same country.

611
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:48,319
Rym: Because we're kind of going through this again right now and not enough people seem mad about this.

612
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,619
Scott: People with bread and circuses.

613
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,420
Rym: You've got to get mad.

614
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,418
Scott: Bread and circuses.

615
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,000
Scott: Anyway, other meta moments.

616
00:31:57,402 --> 00:32:00,860
Scott: If you're, I guess, a new person, this is the first episode we've done.

617
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:05,160
Scott: You should go find us everywhere that we are on the internet.

618
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:05,879
Scott: Which is Twitter.

619
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,540
Scott: Which is Facebook.

620
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,620
Scott: Which is Google Plus.

621
00:32:09,282 --> 00:32:10,340
Scott: Which is our forum.

622
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,360
Rym: All our, oh, not all our.

623
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,920
Rym: Maybe half of our PAX lectures ever are all on YouTube for you to watch.

624
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,840
Scott: We also have a newsletter and I'm going to send another one out soon.

625
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,252
Scott: Oh shit.

626
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,560
Scott: We just haven't done any new episodes that I can write about in the newsletter.

627
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,060
Scott: So, maybe next week I'll send the next newsletter.

628
00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:28,120
Rym: And you saw some of the trickle already.

629
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:36,700
Rym: There will be a long form trickle of videos and things and pictures from PAX Australia as we get them together.

630
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,479
Rym: And ConnectiCon.

631
00:32:39,144 --> 00:32:41,000
Rym: I have video of a bunch of stuff from ConnectiCon.

632
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,180
Scott: ConnectiCon was right before PAX Australia and we haven't talked about that yet.

633
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,500
Scott: That was a big deal.

634
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,303
Rym: In fact, I did.

635
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:49,179
Rym: Dave Riley and Ajay showed up.

636
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:50,500
Rym: They did their panel.

637
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:52,580
Rym: I have video and audio of it.

638
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:53,759
Rym: I'm going to upload it.

639
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,638
Rym: You can watch it.

640
00:32:55,041 --> 00:33:00,579
Rym: I want to use this as ammo to convince Dave to come to more conventions like MAGFest and PAX.

641
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,179
Scott: You should really just go to MAGFest, seriously.

642
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,400
Rym: MAGFest is kind of up your alley.

643
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:05,898
Scott: Drinking and gaming.

644
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,720
Rym: Drinking and gaming with chill people.

645
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,352
Scott: I mean, come on.

646
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:10,580
Rym: There are non-chill parts of MAGFest.

647
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,740
Rym: The stink in the corner.

648
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:13,599
Scott: You don't go there.

649
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,499
Rym: Yeah, just stay out of that corner.

650
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,020
Rym: But yeah, the whole reason we flew halfway around the world.

651
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:26,360
Rym: 25 hours of traveling each way, skipping an entire day, was to go to PAXOS.

652
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,558
Rym: The first PAXOS.

653
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,280
Rym: So we reviewed basically the first PAX we went to and, you know, the first PAX East.

654
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,199
Rym: And we don't really do a full review of every PAX we go to because we go to several a year.

655
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,140
Scott: And it's mostly the same every time and certain people who like convention shows and certain ones who don't.

656
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,719
Scott: So we try to, you know, balance between the two.

657
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,240
Scott: Having them and also not having them.

658
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,059
Scott: So I will say one thing.

659
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,080
Rym: All of you who tell us that no one wants to hear the convention episodes.

660
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,400
Rym: Seriously guys, half the people who talk to us tell us the exact opposite.

661
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,320
Rym: Stop trying to pretend that you're the majority.

662
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:00,000
Scott: It's half and half, who knows.

663
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,159
Scott: But we've got to talk about PAX Australia, right?

664
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:03,320
Rym: It's the first one.

665
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:03,999
Scott: That's right.

666
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:04,977
Scott: And it's a big deal.

667
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,438
Scott: Because Australia is desperate for nerdery.

668
00:34:07,901 --> 00:34:10,699
Scott: And this was the first time anyone brought them some real nerdery.

669
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,040
Scott: So they were very, very grateful.

670
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,257
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

671
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:24,639
Rym: The one thing that I can say that is absolutely apparent about nerds in Australia is that they are way more dedicated to their nerdery than the average nerd in the US.

672
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,279
Scott: You have to be.

673
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,978
Rym: Yeah, things cost way more money.

674
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,978
Scott: The supply of nerdery is lower.

675
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,159
Rym: You live in a country that doesn't have free speech.

676
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:35,056
Scott: The cost of nerdery is higher, right?

677
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,839
Rym: Yeah, we went to a comic shop that was nearby the con.

678
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,759
Scott: The difficulty of finding other nerds is higher.

679
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,320
Rym: And in this comic shop there was a My Little Pony backpack.

680
00:34:42,943 --> 00:34:44,510
Rym: It was a hundred goddamn dollars.

681
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,040
Scott: Holy shit.

682
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:46,859
Rym: There was manga.

683
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,839
Scott: That's like a twenty dollar throwaway thing in like an anime con dealer's room.

684
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,879
Rym: Five dollar manga was ten dollars.

685
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:53,589
Scott: Yup.

686
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,139
Rym: Four dollar comics were six dollars.

687
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,640
Scott: And the sign that said this week's comics, I was pretty sure those were last week's comics.

688
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,340
Scott: But they weren't that far behind because I did see a guy on the train reading Saga volume two.

689
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,700
Scott: So not too far behind, but still not up to date.

690
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:09,020
Scott: Everything is slow there.

691
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:09,240
Rym: Yup.

692
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:13,059
Rym: A lot of games don't legally get released because of the weird free speech laws there.

693
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,860
Scott: It's not a good place.

694
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,480
Scott: It's not the best place for nerds, but there are nerds there.

695
00:35:18,881 --> 00:35:20,359
Scott: It's, you know, they're there for other reasons.

696
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,580
Scott: That's just where they live.

697
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,519
Scott: People live everywhere and you got to do what you got to do.

698
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,500
Rym: And it was very telling that we arrived on Thursday morning.

699
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,580
Rym: We walked around and then we decided to just go and get our badges, even though really we were supposed to get them Friday.

700
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:36,540
Rym: So we just got on the tram, went to the PAX grounds to see what was up.

701
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,119
Rym: And it was at the show grounds.

702
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:40,219
Rym: That's a horse racing track.

703
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,240
Scott: Yeah.

704
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:45,200
Scott: I mean, the show grounds was also used for other things besides the horse racy thing.

705
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:52,640
Scott: But it was mostly an outdoor sort of kind of place where you would have rodeos or tractor pulls.

706
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:01,640
Rym: Now this appears to be because this is not a city or even a country that has convention centers like we're used to in the US.

707
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:08,280
Rym: Those things that we have like the BCC, the BCEC, they're kind of anomalies in the world.

708
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,259
Rym: There aren't that many places like that.

709
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:15,260
Rym: And the US seems to have more of them than anywhere else because they're mostly built by taxpayers and corruption.

710
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:18,060
Rym: But it was a show grounds.

711
00:36:18,382 --> 00:36:20,740
Rym: So we get there and we don't know how to get in.

712
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,960
Rym: We're on this like dark street.

713
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:22,639
Rym: There's a fence.

714
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,458
Rym: Everything's dark.

715
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,018
Rym: We eventually find all these enforcers who also can't figure out how to get in.

716
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:28,740
Rym: And we all just start walking.

717
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:30,940
Rym: We eventually find a guy wearing an orange vest.

718
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,280
Rym: We go to walk in and he asks us if we're enforcers.

719
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,820
Rym: And we, of course, say yes because I kind of want to just go in and get my badge, even though we're not enforcers.

720
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,580
Scott: We weren't enforcers this time.

721
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,419
Rym: Yes, not at this packs.

722
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:44,379
Scott: Not right now, but I will be maybe next year.

723
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:52,160
Rym: And one, the guy was trusting and it just gave us orange visibility vest and told us how to get in so we could just walk in.

724
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,260
Scott: So I just carried my vest.

725
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Scott: I'm like, I'm not wearing a twerky vest.

726
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,720
Rym: And they're like, no, you got to wear it because there were forklifts flying around at high velocity everywhere.

727
00:36:58,863 --> 00:36:59,680
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

728
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,520
Rym: And two, the guy was a super nerd gamer.

729
00:37:04,202 --> 00:37:05,959
Scott: He was also like a big chef.

730
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,578
Scott: This is a cool dude, the security guard at Paxos.

731
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,100
Rym: Yeah, he was working the security shift so that he could get a chance to walk around Pax because it was sold out.

732
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:16,720
Scott: Yeah, this guy was a cool dude.

733
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:17,957
Scott: I remember that guy.

734
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,260
Scott: Just like I remember Scottish dude from those other packs.

735
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,840
Scott: Scottish dude, if you're listening, email us or something.

736
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,994
Rym: You're an awesome dude.

737
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:30,199
Rym: We walked around the sci-fi museum in Seattle after Pax one year.

738
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,333
Scott: You remember that?

739
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:31,731
Rym: Yeah.

740
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:32,640
Scott: You're that guy.

741
00:37:32,842 --> 00:37:33,539
Scott: We're those guys.

742
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,737
Rym: And you're that guy.

743
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:35,880
Rym: And with our powers combined.

744
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,160
Scott: We saw you at Pax East, even.

745
00:37:37,364 --> 00:37:37,536
Scott: Come on.

746
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,639
Rym: We can be those guys.

747
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:39,460
Scott: Come back to Pax East.

748
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,299
Rym: You should have come to Paxos so they could have made fun of your accent yet again.

749
00:37:42,685 --> 00:37:42,940
Scott: Yeah.

750
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:49,640
Rym: But this guy, this cool security guard who was super cool, we hung out there for a while just talking to him and hanging out.

751
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,580
Rym: And one by one, all the enforcers who came up and joined our conversation led me to realize something very interesting.

752
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:58,100
Rym: Now I cannot say this is universal to Australia.

753
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:12,020
Rym: It might've just been because it was a Pax, but, and it's purely anecdotal, but I have to say everyone we met that night hanging out at the entrance to Pax was super chill, super into gaming.

754
00:38:12,381 --> 00:38:12,956
Scott: Not that guy.

755
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:21,800
Rym: And when queried as to what kinds of games they like, they gave advanced and complicated answers filled with nuance.

756
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:23,799
Scott: Also mostly PC games.

757
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:25,039
Rym: Mostly PC gaming.

758
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:31,340
Rym: I pretty much rapidly got the impression that in Australia, console gaming is looked down on as kind of like baby gaming.

759
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:37,120
Rym: Like, yeah, if you can't get your PC to work, like you don't know how to get a gaming PC, then I guess you could buy an Xbox.

760
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:42,900
Scott: They literally had stores, physical stores on the street that looked like Newegg, the store.

761
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:44,554
Scott: There were more than one of these, right?

762
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,640
Scott: I really only saw one GameStop in the bottom of them all.

763
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:49,573
Scott: And it was pretty sad.

764
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:55,780
Scott: Basically there are as many of the PC buying stores as we have GameStops.

765
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,260
Rym: And you ask someone here, like if I ask a random person at Pax, like, hey, what kind of game are you?

766
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,160
Rym: Like what kind of games are you into?

767
00:39:02,822 --> 00:39:05,060
Rym: They usually give a really shallow answer.

768
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,560
Rym: Now they might be a very deep gamer.

769
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,920
Rym: They might be really into gaming, but they give the initial safe, shallow answer.

770
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:14,020
Rym: Any random person asks this kind of like, yeah, so what are you playing?

771
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,680
Rym: They'd be like, LOL, but I only play these four characters.

772
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:22,641
Rym: Like that's the first thing they would say, or I really only play Counter-Strike 1.6.

773
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:24,861
Rym: Actually a lot of people said Counter-Strike 1.6.

774
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:26,078
Scott: A lot of people did say that.

775
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,720
Scott: And it's obvious why, because the consoles are too much money and the Steam sale is a savior to them, right?

776
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,259
Scott: Just like it's a savior to us, but to them even more so.

777
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:47,160
Rym: So we, you know, go in and we walk around and we realized at this moment of revelation, because there were hundreds and hundreds of people all over the place, and the enforcers were all getting their information and checking in.

778
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:54,360
Rym: And I realized at that moment that with the exception of maybe 10 or 15 people, none of them had ever enforced before.

779
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,180
Rym: And the vast majority of them had never experienced a PAX before.

780
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:03,100
Scott: I saw like five enforcers that I, I mean, you know, not counting, say Robert Koo or Heels, right?

781
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,619
Scott: It's like there were like five enforcers, maybe, that I knew from other PAXes.

782
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,068
Scott: Yeah.

783
00:40:08,129 --> 00:40:08,498
Scott: Tops.

784
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:12,714
Rym: Though it also caused this weird moment where it was like that first PAX.

785
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:16,840
Rym: we went to way back in 2008, where it was really just me and Scott.

786
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:20,620
Rym: And we met some listeners and we didn't really know anyone in Seattle.

787
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,612
Rym: Didn't really know any enforcers.

788
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:23,500
Rym: It was all new to us.

789
00:40:23,802 --> 00:40:26,639
Rym: So we kind of went into it with this mindset of we don't know anyone.

790
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:29,399
Rym: Let's, we're going to have to like find people.

791
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,180
Rym: People all seem to know who we were here and it was kind of weird.

792
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:33,739
Scott: That was weird.

793
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:40,460
Rym: It was really, really weird to be walking down the hall or I guess the, uh, the tent at PAX in Australia.

794
00:40:40,902 --> 00:40:41,786
Rym: The first one ever.

795
00:40:41,846 --> 00:40:45,040
Rym: we'd never presented, never, neither one of us ever been to Australia before.

796
00:40:45,661 --> 00:40:48,051
Rym: And people are just like, Hey, Rym and Scott.

797
00:40:48,132 --> 00:40:48,935
Rym: Hey, what's up?

798
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,020
Rym: Hey, we know you.

799
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,517
Rym: And we're like, Hey, all you people we don't know.

800
00:40:55,382 --> 00:40:57,089
Rym: So yeah, literally big top.

801
00:40:57,149 --> 00:40:59,580
Rym: We go to the big top where tabletop was.

802
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:01,699
Rym: It was a circus big top.

803
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:03,629
Scott: It was, this is a show grounds.

804
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:04,936
Scott: It was outside.

805
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:05,660
Scott: It was cold.

806
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,580
Rym: Like complete with those angled pillars that hold the tent up and those weird platforms and spotlights.

807
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,960
Scott: I guess they were doing what they had to work with down under.

808
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,048
Rym: It was a circus big top.

809
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,460
Rym: And let me tell you, shit was cold.

810
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,467
Scott: It was cold in there.

811
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:21,620
Rym: I was so cold.

812
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:29,360
Scott: We basically, you would always hang out by the, they had these heating blowing things near the entrances and it would always be little groups hanging out around them talking.

813
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:31,619
Scott: And we met a lot of cool people hanging out by the heaters.

814
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,080
Rym: Yeah, because that's where you hung out because it was fucking cold.

815
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,940
Scott: So we'd go by the heating blower, take turns standing directly in front of it or around it and chat it up.

816
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,687
Scott: And always cool people were standing there.

817
00:41:40,907 --> 00:41:44,039
Rym: Well, cool temperature wise, trying to warm up.

818
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,420
Rym: Yes, but it was so cold and it was pouring rain for most of packs.

819
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:57,920
Rym: So you'd see people like working up the gumption to run across the significant distance in the rain to get from the big top.

820
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:07,280
Rym: And it's open fucking side through the rain to PC gaming, which was known like separate building, which I guess that's where like the press people watch the horse races.

821
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:08,143
Scott: I don't know.

822
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:08,927
Scott: I don't know.

823
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:11,820
Scott: But yeah, things that were different about this pat.

824
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,700
Scott: I mean the packs, even though it had all this, you know, it was totally Australia, totally new.

825
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:21,379
Scott: It was mostly like other packs is only a smaller be outside and cold.

826
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,980
Scott: See, it was basically it was like an early packs.

827
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:29,580
Scott: It was like traveling in a time machine and going back to packs.

828
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:35,740
Scott: Oh, eight or seven, which I wasn't even at right where no one there knew how to packs, but they figure it out.

829
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,720
Scott: And they came to mostly the same conclusion that all the other packs had come to you and they did the same thing.

830
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,161
Scott: They were just.

831
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:41,784
Scott: it was.

832
00:42:41,804 --> 00:42:46,680
Scott: they were figuring out like you go to the Q and A and it's like, oh, this feels like the Q and A from five years ago.

833
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,900
Scott: And I bet in five years this will feel like the Q and A packs.

834
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,289
Rym: We had a bet we were going to.

835
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:52,880
Rym: we wanted to make a packs as bingo.

836
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,020
Rym: We didn't have time to put it together because Connecticut.

837
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,982
Rym: But one of the things I wanted to put on it was emotionally charged P.A Q and A question.

838
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:07,600
Rym: The first question was basically a guy who's like friend died and didn't get to come to the con.

839
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,243
Rym: But he'd been away.

840
00:43:08,263 --> 00:43:09,771
Rym: They'd win their whole lives for a pack.

841
00:43:09,992 --> 00:43:11,420
Rym: And it was just so great to see them.

842
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,965
Rym: And it pretty much just went on for there.

843
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:26,360
Scott: It was just like that first paxies where all these people who have never gotten to meet Mike and Jerry before and never got to see this still happens at the other paxies, but not as much because everyone sort of already gotten it out of the system.

844
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:31,840
Scott: The majority of the stuff at the other paxies by this point is sort of like, hey, guys, what's up again?

845
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:35,399
Scott: How's that thing going that we do every time that we do this?

846
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:35,781
Rym: Yep.

847
00:43:36,343 --> 00:43:39,800
Rym: Though I got to experience something great because I got up in line.

848
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,910
Rym: Actually, that emotional question was the third question.

849
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:46,300
Rym: The second question would have been me asking for the knuckle crack.

850
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:49,737
Scott: But someone else, the first guy in the other line had the knuckle crack.

851
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:50,240
Rym: I know.

852
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:55,780
Rym: So I got to experience a crowd of people who had never experienced the knuckle, knuckle crack, experiencing the knuckle.

853
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:02,880
Scott: And let me tell you, the oh, noise that they made was I'm building my knuckles up because I got to use them again in three weeks.

854
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:08,160
Scott: Be careful with that because we've only had like a month to recharge as opposed to the usual six months.

855
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:09,626
Rym: But people lined up early.

856
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,016
Rym: The keynote filled up as it should have.

857
00:44:12,056 --> 00:44:13,040
Rym: The Q and A was full.

858
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:18,620
Scott: Everything filled because the rooms are small, but they still let in while the pax was physically smaller.

859
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,203
Scott: There was still.

860
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,311
Scott: it was sold out.

861
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,660
Scott: There was still tons of people everywhere.

862
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,366
Scott: So everything filled all the time.

863
00:44:23,406 --> 00:44:27,140
Scott: I think every single panel except for the Skippy Theater filled one hundred percent.

864
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:27,943
Scott: I'm pretty sure.

865
00:44:28,204 --> 00:44:28,485
Rym: Yeah.

866
00:44:28,726 --> 00:44:30,915
Rym: If not, the vast majority of them definitely filled.

867
00:44:30,955 --> 00:44:32,200
Rym: People lined up.

868
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,826
Rym: Our panel was the first one of the.

869
00:44:33,846 --> 00:44:36,378
Scott: it was in the first just like the first panel we did at Pax08.

870
00:44:37,001 --> 00:44:37,222
Rym: Yep.

871
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:40,380
Rym: Where we're like, I wonder if people are going to show up and then we go over to the panel room.

872
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,526
Scott: There's a line of people waiting.

873
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:42,551
Scott: It's somewhat significant.

874
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:44,420
Scott: We go inside and then the room is full.

875
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,584
Scott: We're like, well, one hundred percent full.

876
00:44:45,604 --> 00:44:46,066
Scott: How about that?

877
00:44:46,287 --> 00:44:46,507
Rym: Yep.

878
00:44:47,009 --> 00:44:49,820
Rym: People lined up for a long time to see our panel and what was great.

879
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:53,515
Rym: Almost no one we knew lined up to see our panel.

880
00:44:53,596 --> 00:44:54,279
Rym: Thank you, guys.

881
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,280
Scott: Finally, people we knew didn't fly to Australia to take seats away from new listeners.

882
00:44:59,681 --> 00:45:09,580
Rym: It's like, yeah, dude, I'm glad that you really like my anime openers from around the world panel, but you've seen it three times and the room is full and there's someone outside who hasn't seen it.

883
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,390
Rym: And it's been the same three years in a row.

884
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,219
Rym: I have literally not changed the words that I have said.

885
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,428
Scott: We did the usual panel.

886
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:20,680
Scott: People liked it.

887
00:45:21,142 --> 00:45:24,240
Scott: As we predicted, they don't have indie tabletop RPGs in Australia.

888
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,140
Rym: That was the main reason we did such an old standby panel for ourselves beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

889
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,500
Rym: And on the tram to Pax, we picked a random dude really good dog because he was a tabletop RPG.

890
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,344
Rym: We were talking to him.

891
00:45:35,364 --> 00:45:36,511
Rym: He's like really into D&D.

892
00:45:37,095 --> 00:45:37,920
Rym: Well, we queried him.

893
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,985
Scott: Pathfinder's big there.

894
00:45:39,046 --> 00:45:40,453
Rym: He's really into Pathfinder.

895
00:45:40,473 --> 00:45:41,940
Rym: I think most people are into Pathfinder.

896
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,131
Rym: And we were like, all right, we're going to list a bunch of games.

897
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,040
Rym: Tell us if you've heard of any of these.

898
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:47,963
Rym: Burning Wheel?

899
00:45:48,183 --> 00:45:48,404
Rym: Nope.

900
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:49,367
Rym: Inspectors?

901
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:50,090
Rym: Nope.

902
00:45:50,712 --> 00:45:51,656
Rym: Any other game?

903
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:52,177
Rym: Nope.

904
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:52,880
Rym: What do you play?

905
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:53,802
Rym: Pathfinder?

906
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:55,308
Rym: And I used to play D&D third ed.

907
00:45:55,529 --> 00:45:58,140
Scott: I think one guy mentioned L5R to me at a point during the weekend.

908
00:45:58,821 --> 00:46:01,840
Scott: I saw actually two tables and tabletop playing L5R card game.

909
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:03,910
Scott: I saw those guys.

910
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:10,199
Rym: In fact, I saw those guys and I talked to him a little bit because they moved their table over by one of the heaters.

911
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:22,128
Scott: Yeah, but pretty much only the biggest games are like worthwhile for companies to send there, which is really interesting is if you the one thing that really interested me was how, you know, as usual, WotC takes about half the tabletop space.

912
00:46:22,188 --> 00:46:22,409
Rym: Yep.

913
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:30,559
Scott: Usually when they take up the tabletop space at a Pax Easton Prime, half of their WotC space is magic and half of it is D&D.

914
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:35,257
Scott: At Pax Australia, it was one hundred percent magic with no D&D.

915
00:46:35,317 --> 00:46:38,550
Scott: They did not bring any D&D anything to Pax Australia.

916
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:39,614
Scott: They only brought magic.

917
00:46:40,076 --> 00:46:41,622
Scott: Magic was huge there.

918
00:46:42,064 --> 00:46:42,245
Scott: Right.

919
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:47,346
Scott: The local game store that we went to, I went there for a Netrunner tournament actually later in the week when Rym wasn't there.

920
00:46:47,868 --> 00:46:50,640
Scott: It's pretty much just a magic store with a little bit of board games in the corner.

921
00:46:52,483 --> 00:46:52,664
Scott: Right.

922
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,332
Scott: And this magic was just huge.

923
00:46:54,473 --> 00:46:58,711
Scott: I mean, it's huge everywhere, but it was just the percentage wise, it was bigger.

924
00:46:58,731 --> 00:46:59,374
Scott: Right.

925
00:46:59,555 --> 00:47:05,619
Scott: Even though overall size, probably about the same as it was at Prime or, you know, whatever it is.

926
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:14,677
Scott: Magic is their game because magic is a big enough game that it's worth economically to send it to Australia, even though magic cards there, it's twice the cost they are here.

927
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:15,119
Rym: Yeah.

928
00:47:16,481 --> 00:47:19,815
Scott: So, yeah, it's just like magic just took over almost all the gaming space.

929
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:26,502
Rym: There was a lot of board gaming going on, but the space that was not magic was pretty much all hardcore German style games.

930
00:47:26,602 --> 00:47:29,393
Rym: And people really were only playing quality games.

931
00:47:29,574 --> 00:47:31,943
Scott: I saw, you know, Cards Against Humanities and things around.

932
00:47:31,984 --> 00:47:33,269
Scott: But yeah, it was mostly.

933
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,237
Scott: mostly I saw power grids.

934
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,145
Scott: I saw Agricolas all over.

935
00:47:37,466 --> 00:47:38,249
Rym: Lots of Agricolas.

936
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:40,839
Scott: I saw more Agricolas and power grids than I saw settlerses.

937
00:47:41,882 --> 00:47:43,750
Scott: There was some race for the galaxies.

938
00:47:43,891 --> 00:47:45,759
Rym: I saw multiple games of Eclipse going on.

939
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,972
Scott: Puerto Rico's, you know, all that kind of stuff.

940
00:47:49,052 --> 00:47:53,410
Rym: It was so hard to find tabletop space, though, that we basically, well, it's always hard to find tabletop.

941
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:57,386
Scott: It was hardest, maybe hard as we had tables.

942
00:47:57,466 --> 00:47:57,707
Scott: Yes.

943
00:47:57,807 --> 00:48:05,199
Rym: We got table space by not using tables at one point and going to the queue room, which was mostly empty and running some burning wheel over there.

944
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:07,907
Scott: So that was at the peak hour.

945
00:48:08,288 --> 00:48:08,589
Rym: Yeah.

946
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:13,328
Rym: So they also had a three d s lounge, you know, a portable lounge.

947
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:14,272
Rym: No sumos.

948
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:15,477
Rym: They're just regular old bean bags.

949
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,147
Scott: They were sort of weird seat shaped bean bags.

950
00:48:18,227 --> 00:48:18,970
Rym: They worked OK.

951
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:19,452
Rym: Yeah.

952
00:48:19,793 --> 00:48:22,263
Rym: I'm I'm done with the bean bag as a thing to sit on.

953
00:48:22,644 --> 00:48:23,548
Rym: No, they're not that good.

954
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,416
Scott: I'm rather sitting at the floor.

955
00:48:25,677 --> 00:48:31,239
Rym: But yeah, pretty much everyone in that area seemed to mostly be playing candy box street pass.

956
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,528
Scott: I saw Animal Crossing's fire emblems.

957
00:48:33,668 --> 00:48:33,929
Rym: Yeah.

958
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:35,797
Rym: That's that's mostly what I saw.

959
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:38,669
Scott: They also had a TV just showing adventure time the whole time.

960
00:48:38,689 --> 00:48:39,010
Scott: Yeah.

961
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:41,460
Rym: I guess copyright stuff like that is not a big deal.

962
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,868
Rym: They can just show stuff randomly.

963
00:48:42,888 --> 00:48:44,700
Scott: It looked like someone just did that.

964
00:48:46,102 --> 00:48:55,740
Rym: Speaking of not worrying about stuff, the fire marshals in Australia seem to be quite unconcerned with the level of fire marshallness that they're exuding.

965
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,272
Rym: But they look the same as our American fire marshals.

966
00:48:59,473 --> 00:48:59,674
Scott: Yep.

967
00:48:59,694 --> 00:49:00,538
Scott: They're just Australian.

968
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:00,960
Rym: Yep.

969
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,169
Rym: They have the same mustaches, same culture.

970
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:05,820
Rym: But they seemed I talked to one of them.

971
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:14,697
Rym: They seemed amazed that the enforcers managed the lines and everything so well that they basically after the first few minutes were like, yeah, whatever.

972
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:15,339
Rym: You guys got this.

973
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:22,325
Rym: They seemed surprised, too, that they limited the number of people in the panel rooms to the number of seats.

974
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:29,297
Rym: I overheard a conversation where I think it was the fire marshal said something like, you know, you could just let people stand at the back like, I'm not going to stop you.

975
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:34,233
Scott: They're like, yeah, no, we're not doing that.

976
00:49:34,293 --> 00:49:36,240
Scott: What else was different and noteworthy?

977
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:38,127
Rym: Oh, there's quite a bit.

978
00:49:38,147 --> 00:49:41,622
Rym: So one PC gaming is obviously way bigger there.

979
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:43,429
Rym: And there was more.

980
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,140
Rym: console gaming was a joke at this kind of a tiny little space.

981
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:50,860
Rym: A lot of times the TV, the TVs were not 100 percent occupied.

982
00:49:51,583 --> 00:50:03,992
Rym: And because of the bad free speech in Australia, you needed to wear a wristband showing if you were above 18 or above 15, you couldn't go into certain areas unless you had the right colored wristband.

983
00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:04,253
Scott: Yeah.

984
00:50:04,454 --> 00:50:08,972
Scott: Even the expo hall, I think was you needed to get like certain booths in the expo hall.

985
00:50:09,012 --> 00:50:11,161
Scott: You needed to be 18 to go into the booth.

986
00:50:11,703 --> 00:50:14,373
Scott: And then didn't you have to be 15 period to get in there?

987
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:15,297
Rym: Even tabletop.

988
00:50:15,357 --> 00:50:17,145
Rym: I don't remember the exact big top.

989
00:50:17,185 --> 00:50:19,213
Rym: You needed your 15 plus wristband to get in.

990
00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:20,840
Scott: Yeah, it's crazy.

991
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:21,241
Rym: Yeah.

992
00:50:21,261 --> 00:50:25,860
Rym: We had to show our ID every day to get a black wristband to be allowed to go to PC gaming.

993
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:27,687
Scott: That's what the problem of no free speech is.

994
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,116
Rym: But we went over to free PC gaming.

995
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:33,951
Rym: They only let you play for like 45 minutes because there was a constant crazy line.

996
00:50:33,991 --> 00:50:35,276
Scott: We were definitely in there for less than four.

997
00:50:35,296 --> 00:50:36,320
Scott: We were in there maybe a half hour.

998
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:43,971
Rym: I went over there to join the gun game counter strike tournament and it was already there's.

999
00:50:44,052 --> 00:50:49,252
Rym: so many people were lined up that they doubled the size of the tournament effectively and still turned away.

1000
00:50:49,694 --> 00:50:51,120
Rym: Almost everyone who was standing there.

1001
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,145
Rym: It was ridiculous.

1002
00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:58,409
Scott: gaming is king everywhere in the world except the US and Japan and in the PC gaming area.

1003
00:50:58,429 --> 00:51:01,743
Rym: It seemed like it was mostly league of legends.

1004
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:02,446
Scott: Yep.

1005
00:51:02,847 --> 00:51:03,671
Rym: And counter strike.

1006
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:03,992
Scott: Yep.

1007
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:05,700
Scott: Those are the top two games for sure.

1008
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:09,414
Rym: Full of like portal co-ops, a handful of other things, but dota.

1009
00:51:09,474 --> 00:51:12,185
Scott: dota was up there, but not as nearly as big as legal interestingly.

1010
00:51:12,446 --> 00:51:14,394
Rym: Zero world of Warcraft.

1011
00:51:14,735 --> 00:51:19,936
Scott: Well, I don't think there was really internet in the, uh, I don't, I know there was cause.

1012
00:51:19,956 --> 00:51:23,711
Rym: I saw a number of people log out of the pack steam and log in with their own accounts.

1013
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:24,474
Scott: Oh, I guess there was.

1014
00:51:24,635 --> 00:51:25,840
Rym: I saw lots of people doing that.

1015
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:26,883
Scott: Maybe there was.

1016
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:34,716
Rym: I am very vindicated in my skills at counter strike too, because I got to say when we played, uh, Scott, you did not do so well.

1017
00:51:35,077 --> 00:51:35,358
Rym: Okay.

1018
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:35,780
Rym: You did not.

1019
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:42,848
Rym: I won our second game, came in second place in the first game, notwithstanding of the one guy who was crazy better than everyone.

1020
00:51:42,888 --> 00:51:44,073
Rym: I beat him in the second game.

1021
00:51:44,153 --> 00:51:45,297
Scott: Listen, I killed people.

1022
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:47,868
Scott: I wasn't down at the bottom, like just getting killed, not killing anybody.

1023
00:51:47,888 --> 00:51:49,414
Rym: In the first game you were second to the bottom.

1024
00:51:49,936 --> 00:51:50,257
Scott: I wasn't.

1025
00:51:50,378 --> 00:51:51,342
Rym: Yeah, you were second to the bottom.

1026
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:57,105
Rym: I took screenshots that I cannot share because they're on that PC because I wasn't logged into my steam.

1027
00:51:58,570 --> 00:51:59,895
Rym: I should have taken a picture with my phone.

1028
00:52:00,858 --> 00:52:01,400
Scott: What are the games?

1029
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,209
Scott: did you say you won that you didn't win that I won?

1030
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,220
Rym: I don't remember what else we played.

1031
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:09,453
Rym: You beat me more times than I beat you with that weird gear game.

1032
00:52:09,473 --> 00:52:10,920
Scott: Oh, gear game.

1033
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:11,723
Scott: That was my game.

1034
00:52:11,803 --> 00:52:12,747
Scott: That's my web of power.

1035
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,956
Rym: You weren't undefeated in that game though.

1036
00:52:15,116 --> 00:52:15,538
Scott: That's true.

1037
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:15,859
Rym: Yeah.

1038
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:20,760
Rym: I think web of power is your web of power, obviously.

1039
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:23,430
Rym: But yeah, PC gaming was super rockin the whole time.

1040
00:52:23,892 --> 00:52:32,969
Rym: And another side point about the 3DS lounge, the challenge that they had on the whiteboard was old school snaking Mario Kart.

1041
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:34,576
Rym: Get the fastest ghost.

1042
00:52:34,737 --> 00:52:37,026
Rym: And I think the stage.

1043
00:52:37,046 --> 00:52:37,869
Rym: Yeah, the Waluigi.

1044
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:38,572
Rym: It was some stage.

1045
00:52:38,913 --> 00:52:40,820
Rym: I think Waluigi pinball, right?

1046
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,081
Rym: Yep.

1047
00:52:41,322 --> 00:52:41,623
Rym: Yeah.

1048
00:52:42,446 --> 00:52:43,149
Rym: Uh, yeah.

1049
00:52:43,169 --> 00:52:43,972
Rym: I looked that time.

1050
00:52:43,993 --> 00:52:46,743
Rym: I looked at my old copy of that game.

1051
00:52:47,024 --> 00:52:48,932
Rym: That time is fucking ridiculous.

1052
00:52:49,996 --> 00:52:51,060
Rym: Fucking ridiculous.

1053
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,566
Scott: The guy probably just snaked the whole thing.

1054
00:52:52,988 --> 00:52:55,700
Rym: Yeah, but I snaked the whole thing and I could get nowhere near that.

1055
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,390
Rym: So that guy must have snaked to a degree that is legendary.

1056
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,057
Rym: Okay.

1057
00:53:00,097 --> 00:53:02,206
Scott: I'm sure the enforcers checked it out to make sure he wasn't cheating.

1058
00:53:02,286 --> 00:53:02,888
Rym: I'm sure they did.

1059
00:53:03,872 --> 00:53:04,876
Rym: It was an interesting note.

1060
00:53:05,378 --> 00:53:08,652
Rym: The expo hall, very tiny as it's very tiny, really.

1061
00:53:08,692 --> 00:53:12,647
Scott: I mean, usually in the expo hall, which is the party packs, I care about less than others.

1062
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:18,490
Scott: Uh, you know, you walk around at once, you look at every booth and usually I see a bunch of things in there.

1063
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:25,860
Scott: For example, at PAX East last year, I saw Shovel Night and I saw, uh, there was a tabletop dealer that looked at some board games they had.

1064
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,811
Scott: We discovered spot it in there two years ago at PAX East, right?

1065
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:33,711
Scott: I usually see things in there like, ooh, ooh, right at this PAX OS.

1066
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:36,241
Scott: I basically saw nothing in that expo hall.

1067
00:53:36,282 --> 00:53:43,811
Scott: The only thing of interest to me was there was a booth for madman, which is pretty much the company that brings anime and manga to Australia as in the company.

1068
00:53:43,952 --> 00:53:44,815
Scott: There isn't another one.

1069
00:53:44,936 --> 00:53:51,442
Scott: It doesn't seem like to me it anyway, you know, and I was able to reconnoiter the anime manga situation well of Australia.

1070
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:59,154
Rym: So that aside, the, the fact that there was more than one Edward Elric cosplayer at PAX Australia says something.

1071
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:05,077
Scott: so anime and manga were bigger in Australia in general than I had thought.

1072
00:54:05,278 --> 00:54:05,740
Scott: They were.

1073
00:54:06,021 --> 00:54:09,997
Scott: I should, it should have been obvious because it's physically close to Japan, but it's big.

1074
00:54:10,037 --> 00:54:15,720
Rym: They were a big part of packs, pretty much everyone we met because we just met random people and hung out and played games with them.

1075
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,420
Rym: In fact, I remember there's a couple that we played some games with at the end of one of those tabletop roles.

1076
00:54:21,363 --> 00:54:22,126
Rym: They were super cool.

1077
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:26,164
Rym: We basically formed this group of smart people who would play games quickly and it was great.

1078
00:54:26,746 --> 00:54:29,837
Rym: And out of nowhere, I was like something, something anime, something Attack on Titan.

1079
00:54:29,877 --> 00:54:32,047
Rym: The guy was like something, something Attack on Titan.

1080
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:33,474
Rym: And I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1081
00:54:33,494 --> 00:54:34,600
Rym: You speak of the anime.

1082
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,190
Scott: Pretty much everyone spoke of the anime.

1083
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:41,063
Scott: We went to this bar that was totally anime-ed out.

1084
00:54:41,264 --> 00:54:41,445
Rym: Yeah.

1085
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:46,806
Rym: Instead of going to Gordon Beers after PAX, like we normally do, we went to the equivalent, but it was totally anime.

1086
00:54:47,007 --> 00:54:49,056
Rym: It was Asian beer cafe.

1087
00:54:49,176 --> 00:54:49,940
Scott: Asian beer cafe.

1088
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,048
Scott: Just anime stuff all over the walls.

1089
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,393
Scott: Astro Boy in the bathroom.

1090
00:54:53,473 --> 00:54:54,437
Rym: And the thing is, the place.

1091
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,448
Scott: We were watching High School of the Dead on the TV.

1092
00:54:57,548 --> 00:55:01,686
Rym: The place was just normal semi-hip people hanging out.

1093
00:55:01,747 --> 00:55:03,795
Rym: It just happened to be super anime.

1094
00:55:03,815 --> 00:55:09,880
Scott: It was anime around just like, you know, here you can only find anime in an anime store or the anime corner of a Best Buy.

1095
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,004
Rym: I'll be honest, it packs.

1096
00:55:11,325 --> 00:55:18,694
Rym: If I'm hanging out with someone new that I don't know and like something, something anime and anime comes up, I'll usually ask, oh, so what shows do you like?

1097
00:55:18,955 --> 00:55:24,196
Rym: And they'll, and usually they won't be able to mention much and I'll get to do my usual, oh, well, you should watch Cowboy Bebop.

1098
00:55:24,216 --> 00:55:25,120
Rym: That's probably up your alley.

1099
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,404
Scott: You didn't need to do that in Australia.

1100
00:55:26,485 --> 00:55:28,493
Rym: Here, I was like, yeah, so what do you watch?

1101
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:32,027
Rym: He's like, well, right now I'm watching Attack on Titan and all these other current shows.

1102
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:33,152
Scott: Yeah, I've seen Utena.

1103
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:33,313
Scott: Yep.

1104
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,980
Rym: I was like, what are your favorite shows?

1105
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,325
Rym: Like, well, Cowboy Bebop, duh.

1106
00:55:36,385 --> 00:55:38,252
Rym: So I don't know, Utena is pretty good.

1107
00:55:38,272 --> 00:55:38,814
Rym: Yeah.

1108
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,186
Scott: It's like, oh, well, let me tell you about this thing I do.

1109
00:55:42,327 --> 00:55:42,507
Scott: Yeah.

1110
00:55:42,528 --> 00:55:46,320
Rym: Well, I feel like we could have done just as well doing anime panels there.

1111
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:46,701
Scott: Probably.

1112
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:48,045
Scott: It was just, you know, usually in the

1113
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:48,527
Scott: U.S.,

1114
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:53,003
Scott: the thing that we try to push as GeekNights is the crossover of geekeries.

1115
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:53,766
Rym: Because in the U.S.

1116
00:55:53,806 --> 00:55:54,528
Rym: it doesn't happen.

1117
00:55:54,629 --> 00:55:54,910
Rym: Right.

1118
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:55,993
Scott: And there is less of it.

1119
00:55:56,034 --> 00:55:59,427
Scott: There is the, we always bring up Silver Age Spider-Man guy.

1120
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:01,274
Scott: He doesn't even cross over into X-Men.

1121
00:56:01,716 --> 00:56:01,977
Scott: Right.

1122
00:56:02,198 --> 00:56:04,186
Scott: But it's like this guy at PAX who loves games.

1123
00:56:04,247 --> 00:56:05,793
Rym: X-Men, he doesn't cross over into Golden Age.

1124
00:56:05,813 --> 00:56:09,066
Scott: He doesn't cross over into tech or anime or comics or anything.

1125
00:56:09,086 --> 00:56:11,275
Scott: And he's just gaming guy in Australia.

1126
00:56:11,315 --> 00:56:13,162
Scott: It didn't seem like that guy was there.

1127
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:19,748
Scott: People there who were geeks spread across the geekeries, especially the anime and the manga and the gaming.

1128
00:56:19,808 --> 00:56:20,772
Scott: They were, they were merged.

1129
00:56:20,792 --> 00:56:21,775
Scott: It was the same people.

1130
00:56:22,097 --> 00:56:23,864
Rym: There were anime vendors.

1131
00:56:24,145 --> 00:56:27,400
Rym: There were anime DVDs in the grab bag.

1132
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:28,001
Rym: Yep.

1133
00:56:28,161 --> 00:56:30,005
Rym: Like for real anime everywhere.

1134
00:56:30,145 --> 00:56:31,989
Rym: Everyone just kind of knows about it and watches it.

1135
00:56:32,009 --> 00:56:32,610
Scott: It wasn't like.

1136
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:39,186
Scott: It was anime.

1137
00:56:39,206 --> 00:56:39,948
Rym: You know what I would say?

1138
00:56:39,968 --> 00:56:40,450
Scott: And manga.

1139
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:45,989
Rym: It was an undercurrent that the average person you talk to was also a pretty knowledgeable fan of anime.

1140
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:46,270
Rym: Yep.

1141
00:56:46,411 --> 00:56:47,836
Rym: And happened to also be a gamer.

1142
00:56:47,876 --> 00:56:50,045
Scott: But they were behaving in a PAX fashion.

1143
00:56:50,065 --> 00:56:55,266
Scott: They did not behave in an AnimeCon fashion even though maybe like 10% of the cosplays were animes.

1144
00:56:55,668 --> 00:56:57,777
Rym: I think more than 10% when I'm thinking back.

1145
00:56:57,797 --> 00:56:58,941
Rym: I can go through all the pictures I took.

1146
00:56:59,042 --> 00:56:59,805
Scott: It's tough to say.

1147
00:56:59,926 --> 00:57:04,363
Rym: There were two separate Edward Elric cosplayers at a PAX.

1148
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:04,885
Scott: It's true.

1149
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:15,408
Rym: And part of that appears to be in 2013 that a lot of the other cons in Australia are pretty weak sauce.

1150
00:57:16,111 --> 00:57:16,372
Scott: Yeah.

1151
00:57:16,552 --> 00:57:17,074
Scott: It didn't like.

1152
00:57:17,295 --> 00:57:18,962
Scott: do those other cons even have panels?

1153
00:57:18,982 --> 00:57:19,865
Scott: Who speaks at them?

1154
00:57:20,046 --> 00:57:21,010
Scott: Who do they get to go?

1155
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:21,291
Scott: Right.

1156
00:57:21,351 --> 00:57:24,665
Scott: It's like they don't have, you know, that thing going on.

1157
00:57:24,705 --> 00:57:26,392
Scott: That supply of panel doers.

1158
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:32,016
Rym: I think that we have granted packs for the longest time was still pretty much all industry and us.

1159
00:57:32,156 --> 00:57:42,095
Scott: I mean, meanwhile, PAX Prime, if you look at the schedule is looking to have not less industry, but because they added the fourth day, but they didn't get more industry to fill the panels.

1160
00:57:42,135 --> 00:57:47,839
Scott: It seems like they brought in, you know, a lot of the fan sort of content to fill in that space, which is good on them.

1161
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:49,491
Rym: Good on them.

1162
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:50,059
Scott: Good on them.

1163
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:58,816
Rym: But yeah, I was just really surprised at the level of anime crossover and how casual it was.

1164
00:57:58,836 --> 00:58:08,291
Rym: I have a kind of theory that I'll get into more in another show someday, but basically I wonder if it's because there there's a deeper correlation.

1165
00:58:08,412 --> 00:58:13,031
Rym: All the people we met at this packs office, everyone was just super chill, was also super internetty.

1166
00:58:13,553 --> 00:58:18,450
Rym: They knew the same things we knew like new games that are coming out.

1167
00:58:18,771 --> 00:58:28,552
Rym: Even at packs in the US, I'll be like something, something said five and a random person I'm with will either make up some bullshit about it or not know that beyond the soil in

1168
00:58:28,612 --> 00:58:32,990
Scott: Australia where there's nothing, you know, the supplies of geeky or low, you have to be internetty.

1169
00:58:33,311 --> 00:58:33,793
Scott: You have to.

1170
00:58:33,994 --> 00:58:34,516
Rym: Yes, but I

1171
00:58:34,656 --> 00:58:36,082
Scott: think PC gamer, you have to be, there

1172
00:58:36,142 --> 00:58:56,907
Rym: might be non internetty nerds there like there are here, but here because of other means and because packs has been around for so long, non internetty people show up at packs here and people who are like gaming but aren't super hardcore about it show up to packs is here like that kid who thought that packs and the penny arcade expo were separate and thought that penny arcade was homestuck

1173
00:58:56,988 --> 00:58:57,290
Scott: right

1174
00:58:58,317 --> 00:58:58,720
Rym: at packs.

1175
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:05,908
Rym: Us only internet people knew that packs us was happening and it sold out immediately solely to people who are on the internet.

1176
00:59:06,049 --> 00:59:06,490
Rym: That's true.

1177
00:59:06,511 --> 00:59:15,507
Rym: So it might be that we just happened to go to a packs that was literally only available to internet people and internet people are the kinds of people we're talking about.

1178
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,094
Scott: Very well could be.

1179
00:59:17,255 --> 00:59:18,400
Rym: That is entirely possible.

1180
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,025
Rym: Other things going on.

1181
00:59:20,467 --> 00:59:23,120
Rym: The tabletop library was the same as always.

1182
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,225
Rym: The keynote was a great keynote.

1183
00:59:25,265 --> 00:59:30,084
Scott: I think it was actually, it was a typical keynote for packs, which is, you know, above our, you know, it's good.

1184
00:59:30,104 --> 00:59:33,579
Rym: It was the third or fourth best one of any packs I've been to.

1185
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:42,093
Scott: I mean, it seemed like the same keynote over and over again, which is, you know, decent, but I'm sort of getting tired of the, here's how I got into the gaming industry.

1186
00:59:42,154 --> 00:59:43,480
Scott: Look at, let's play the woo game.

1187
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,080
Scott: Let's play the woo game with all the old stuff that I liked when I was young and got me into gaming.

1188
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:50,809
Rym: He talked a lot about the origins of monkey island.

1189
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:51,812
Rym: that was actually really interesting.

1190
00:59:51,832 --> 00:59:52,575
Scott: That was the good part.

1191
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:53,920
Scott: That was the fascinating part.

1192
00:59:54,420 --> 01:00:06,310
Rym: The fact that everyone who's ever given a packs keynote who I respect and who has interesting things to say and has made good games has said that star wars was pretty much the thing that got them going.

1193
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:06,731
Scott: Yes.

1194
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:11,149
Scott: That's like the third or fourth time that's been like, oh my God, star wars, which is, you know why?

1195
01:00:11,229 --> 01:00:14,864
Scott: Because all these people doing it are like these 40, 50 year old dudes.

1196
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:17,414
Rym: But look at, look at the anime industry is the same thing.

1197
01:00:17,434 --> 01:00:19,302
Scott: Our super Mario brothers was their star wars.

1198
01:00:19,402 --> 01:00:25,747
Rym: Every time I go to an anime thing and there's a director and they're giving some speech, they're always talking about how star wars really pushed them.

1199
01:00:25,767 --> 01:00:26,650
Rym: Yep.

1200
01:00:27,132 --> 01:00:27,654
Rym: Star wars.

1201
01:00:27,694 --> 01:00:30,104
Rym: I can't think of a movie that's had that effects in star wars.

1202
01:00:30,144 --> 01:00:34,500
Scott: Yet again, it's all these people who were inspired by film and went into gaming instead of Hollywood.

1203
01:00:35,221 --> 01:00:38,580
Rym: Well, is it better than the people who are inspired by gaming and then go into gaming?

1204
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,308
Scott: You end up with more monkey islands and less eclipses.

1205
01:00:41,468 --> 01:00:46,489
Rym: Like the people are inspired by anime and then go into anime to make anime for people who are then inspired by that.

1206
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:47,915
Scott: Listen, that's also a problem, right?

1207
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:48,980
Rym: Yes, they're all problems.

1208
01:00:50,543 --> 01:01:02,429
Rym: Uh, anyway, the enforcer culture, there were a few little missteps, a couple of line snakes that collapsed, a couple of, you know, early missteps of this guy is new and doesn't know the official way to make a line go.

1209
01:01:03,212 --> 01:01:14,196
Rym: By Friday afternoon, you would be hard pressed to differentiate a Pax Aus enforcer from a Pax Prime enforcer, but for the color of their shirts, but for the nature of their dialect.

1210
01:01:14,377 --> 01:01:24,955
Scott: I was about to say, but for their accent, you could say, Hey, what else do we had to say about Pax Australia without talking about Australia?

1211
01:01:25,096 --> 01:01:26,000
Rym: I just went outside.

1212
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,184
Scott: One thing that was really interesting.

1213
01:01:27,224 --> 01:01:31,120
Rym: I went outside to the grocery store that was next to the con and got a hot meat pie.

1214
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,453
Rym: I bought meat pies for $2 and Red Bulls.

1215
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:42,786
Rym: I probably could have just bought beer and walked into the convention center, past the convention center security, openly eating it and no fucks were given.

1216
01:01:42,826 --> 01:01:45,918
Scott: There were all the food came from these food carts at the packs.

1217
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:50,176
Scott: Now people in Australia like food trucks and the people in Australia were like, all right, the food's okay.

1218
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:57,866
Scott: And I was like, this food is light years beyond the food you will get at concessions at any con I've ever been to in the US.

1219
01:01:57,906 --> 01:02:04,513
Scott: The food is one half a step below the quality of New York, you know, the street truck food, right?

1220
01:02:04,553 --> 01:02:07,766
Rym: Yeah, that is the kind of food I would be okay eating now for lunch.

1221
01:02:07,827 --> 01:02:08,429
Scott: That burger.

1222
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:08,931
Scott: Exactly.

1223
01:02:08,971 --> 01:02:12,586
Scott: That burger I could get there was like a half step under Frites and Meats, right?

1224
01:02:12,626 --> 01:02:13,429
Scott: Which is really good.

1225
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:14,975
Scott: You know, New York City burger truck.

1226
01:02:14,995 --> 01:02:18,931
Rym: And the dim sum I got from the convention center was great.

1227
01:02:19,011 --> 01:02:21,040
Scott: People were like, it's all right.

1228
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:25,176
Scott: And I'm like, you have come to real packs and go to the concessions, right?

1229
01:02:25,196 --> 01:02:26,843
Scott: It PAX Prime.

1230
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:29,092
Rym: It's $6 slice of pizza.

1231
01:02:29,152 --> 01:02:29,292
Scott: Yeah.

1232
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:32,665
Scott: Go to subway, go to the Javits and get the friggin empanada.

1233
01:02:32,806 --> 01:02:34,452
Rym: Stand in line for an hour to get a crap.

1234
01:02:34,593 --> 01:02:34,693
Rym: Yeah.

1235
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:35,677
Scott: You'll fucking kill yourself.

1236
01:02:35,757 --> 01:02:36,179
Scott: Eat that shit.

1237
01:02:36,661 --> 01:02:36,842
Scott: Right.

1238
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,108
Scott: Only cause it will poison you.

1239
01:02:38,228 --> 01:02:40,700
Scott: And because it will taste so bad, you will stab yourself afterwards.

1240
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,573
Rym: This was also the first packs that we had.

1241
01:02:44,613 --> 01:02:45,637
Scott: Those people like Vegemite.

1242
01:02:45,658 --> 01:02:46,059
Scott: So fuck that.

1243
01:02:47,002 --> 01:02:47,584
Rym: I told you.

1244
01:02:47,604 --> 01:02:49,231
Rym: I was like, we should try Vegemite.

1245
01:02:49,271 --> 01:02:51,099
Scott: My coworker is now eating the Vegemite.

1246
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,424
Scott: We'll get more to that in another day.

1247
01:02:52,444 --> 01:02:53,167
Rym: Oh my God.

1248
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,975
Rym: We'll talk about this on Thursday.

1249
01:02:54,995 --> 01:02:55,617
Rym: The Vegemite.

1250
01:02:55,698 --> 01:02:56,300
Scott: Yeah, of course.

1251
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:56,923
Rym: You might.

1252
01:02:57,224 --> 01:02:58,730
Scott: You have to talk about it when you're talking about us.

1253
01:02:58,750 --> 01:02:59,614
Rym: We do have to talk about it.

1254
01:03:00,397 --> 01:03:05,860
Rym: But, uh, we had to take, you know, the convention also lacked something that every other packs has.

1255
01:03:06,461 --> 01:03:09,994
Rym: There was no hotel gaming because there were no hotels.

1256
01:03:10,075 --> 01:03:10,657
Scott: That's correct.

1257
01:03:10,998 --> 01:03:17,243
Rym: You literally took a tram or a train, a significant distance to the convention that was far away or a car.

1258
01:03:17,845 --> 01:03:21,741
Rym: And then you left from there back and everyone was staying all over the city.

1259
01:03:22,103 --> 01:03:23,689
Rym: There was no place you would meet up.

1260
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:27,905
Scott: In fact, and the hotels didn't really have the sort of lobbies that had gaming going on.

1261
01:03:28,086 --> 01:03:32,102
Rym: Ours especially didn't, even though our hotel, I think was 90% packs people.

1262
01:03:32,123 --> 01:03:33,911
Rym: There was no gaming going on in that lobby.

1263
01:03:34,152 --> 01:03:35,438
Scott: None, none whatsoever.

1264
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:44,431
Rym: Now, interestingly, people did hang out after packs, but they all went to bars to hang out and they do that at regular packs too.

1265
01:03:44,531 --> 01:03:44,953
Rym: They do.

1266
01:03:45,274 --> 01:03:47,242
Rym: But that was the only place you could go hang out.

1267
01:03:47,262 --> 01:03:55,795
Scott: There was a place monobar that they really loved, but that place is like a, it's basically their barcade, but their barcade is just like a few TVs on the wall and it's really tiny.

1268
01:03:55,816 --> 01:03:56,538
Scott: Yeah.

1269
01:03:56,558 --> 01:04:00,936
Rym: Game consoles looked up my head in and I got to say something about bars in general in Australia.

1270
01:04:01,739 --> 01:04:13,123
Rym: This might be perception cause I didn't poke my head into all bars, but the bars I poked my head into both the nerdy ones and non nerdy ones, the music and bullshit was half as loud as an average US bar.

1271
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:16,717
Scott: I think in New York is also particularly loud now everywhere.

1272
01:04:16,778 --> 01:04:18,102
Rym: Go to Boston, go to Seattle.

1273
01:04:18,122 --> 01:04:21,496
Rym: They're all just so fucking loud and I just, I've always hated.

1274
01:04:21,536 --> 01:04:23,866
Scott: There was a thing that says the places that are loud make money.

1275
01:04:23,906 --> 01:04:25,452
Scott: The place I know they do out of business.

1276
01:04:25,552 --> 01:04:28,243
Rym: I can talk at length about why that's the case, but I still hate it.

1277
01:04:28,605 --> 01:04:30,874
Rym: I would pay double just to not have it be loud.

1278
01:04:30,974 --> 01:04:32,420
Scott: Another interesting thing, right?

1279
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:43,104
Scott: Is that at packs in the U S East or prime, all the official packs merge, especially the t-shirts that say packs on them and the scarves that say packs on them, sell the fuck out.

1280
01:04:43,385 --> 01:04:48,284
Scott: You could not get one on Sunday usually unless it's like a lady's extra small or some shit like that, right?

1281
01:04:49,348 --> 01:04:50,272
Scott: Add packs OS.

1282
01:04:50,573 --> 01:04:56,316
Scott: People were buying merch on the way out as they were being shoved out of packs as it was closed and there was still some left.

1283
01:04:56,376 --> 01:04:58,245
Scott: I don't know if Robert cool would be happy about that.

1284
01:04:58,688 --> 01:05:00,296
Scott: Uh, cause he bought merging amazing.

1285
01:05:00,336 --> 01:05:05,376
Scott: Never sell, but that was interesting that they were not buying the t-shirts.

1286
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:06,079
Scott: They didn't sell up.

1287
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:12,002
Rym: but uh, I bought the t-shirts because I'm, if I'm going to fly that far, that's going to have the fucking shirt.

1288
01:05:12,444 --> 01:05:14,836
Rym: Wear it to other packs and be like, yeah, yeah.

1289
01:05:14,856 --> 01:05:14,936
Rym: What?

1290
01:05:17,661 --> 01:05:25,920
Rym: But the official shirt, not the like year shirt, but just the night, the sort of stylized shirt is so great for so many reasons.

1291
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,464
Scott: That whole set is great.

1292
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:29,653
Scott: I know, but this one, I have the full set by the way.

1293
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:34,452
Rym: It was the spider for one and two, the pal logo on the bottom really sealed the deal.

1294
01:05:34,492 --> 01:05:35,175
Scott: It definitely did.

1295
01:05:36,259 --> 01:05:38,932
Rym: But yeah, people see that it was a packs.

1296
01:05:38,992 --> 01:05:43,874
Rym: The people were like packs people, just more chill and hip for the reasons we talked about.

1297
01:05:43,914 --> 01:05:45,180
Rym: We'll see if that continues to be true.

1298
01:05:45,721 --> 01:05:48,391
Rym: I don't know how packs can grow in Melbourne.

1299
01:05:49,335 --> 01:05:51,524
Scott: There was, there was that other convention.

1300
01:05:51,544 --> 01:05:57,086
Scott: he plays that's next to the casino to the casino and I don't know if packs really wants to use casino space.

1301
01:05:58,230 --> 01:05:59,756
Rym: We check the space out to a degree.

1302
01:06:00,078 --> 01:06:00,680
Rym: It's okay.

1303
01:06:01,242 --> 01:06:02,286
Rym: It's not great.

1304
01:06:02,347 --> 01:06:03,391
Rym: It's not optimal.

1305
01:06:03,732 --> 01:06:06,623
Rym: I think they'd still be better off being there than being in the show grounds.

1306
01:06:06,644 --> 01:06:08,913
Scott: They're better off being sometime when it's warm and not cold.

1307
01:06:09,676 --> 01:06:12,326
Rym: Rumor has it it'll be in a warmer time next year.

1308
01:06:12,346 --> 01:06:12,929
Rym: Yeah.

1309
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:20,257
Scott: I mean basically at the closing ceremonies, Jerry said, you know, packs will be in Australia next year.

1310
01:06:20,278 --> 01:06:22,065
Scott: So you didn't confirm a time or place.

1311
01:06:22,085 --> 01:06:22,306
Scott: I am 99% sure.

1312
01:06:22,326 --> 01:06:31,462
Scott: Melbourne and I admit there were people's basically saying, yeah, we heard it'll still be Melbourne and I am 80% sure.

1313
01:06:31,623 --> 01:06:33,389
Rym: summertime, maybe fall.

1314
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:40,036
Rym: It will probably be a warmer time, not winter because that shit was, it was way too cold.

1315
01:06:40,358 --> 01:06:42,105
Rym: I wear my kilt one day and then nope.

1316
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:48,210
Rym: Thus I wore the same increasingly getting a more and more dirty jeans.

1317
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:54,955
Scott: Sadly, the next packs I probably, the first packs I won't go to since oh wait, we'll probably be, that doesn't, that's not a dev packs.

1318
01:06:54,996 --> 01:07:00,899
Scott: We'll probably be packs us 2013, 14 speaking of that unless someone pays for us to go.

1319
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,329
Rym: So speaking of that, that was a lot of money.

1320
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:10,217
Rym: Our panel seemed super successful, but two we, uh, there were a lot of GeekNights listeners at this pack.

1321
01:07:10,257 --> 01:07:20,920
Scott: Yeah, I didn't count them, but people basically kept coming up to us all the time talking, knowing who we were and or they saw us at our panel and they said our panel was good and I was like, all right, okay.

1322
01:07:21,501 --> 01:07:26,380
Rym: Uh, one guy actually brought up radio free equestria to me and he was like, yeah, you should do more of that.

1323
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,100
Rym: No, he knew me as the radio free equestria guy cause I had a rainbow days on my badge.

1324
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:31,802
Scott: Of course.

1325
01:07:31,963 --> 01:07:33,790
Rym: And I was like, yeah, you know, I'm here as a speaker.

1326
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:34,754
Rym: He's like, oh, what'd you do?

1327
01:07:34,774 --> 01:07:39,432
Rym: And I was like, yeah, you know, well, you know, uh, gaming GeekNights.

1328
01:07:39,713 --> 01:07:42,848
Rym: Uh, and he thought that we were just the RFE guys.

1329
01:07:43,149 --> 01:07:44,194
Scott: Yeah, we're from Australia.

1330
01:07:44,235 --> 01:07:44,657
Scott: The RFE.

1331
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:45,220
Rym: Yeah.

1332
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:49,050
Rym: Anyway, but there were so many listeners there.

1333
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:54,553
Rym: It was kind of unnerving, which kind of proves what we've been going for all along that we come from the internet.

1334
01:07:54,613 --> 01:07:55,758
Rym: Our culture is on the internet.

1335
01:07:56,019 --> 01:07:59,873
Rym: So our people are not tied to geography.

1336
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:02,243
Rym: They're tied to the geography solely of language.

1337
01:08:02,826 --> 01:08:03,167
Rym: Correct.

1338
01:08:03,408 --> 01:08:05,878
Rym: If you speak English and are a nerd, you might be our people.

1339
01:08:06,139 --> 01:08:06,340
Rym: Yes.

1340
01:08:07,201 --> 01:08:14,270
Rym: Two, all the listeners there were pretty vociferously trying to get us to do a Kickstarter.

1341
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:14,973
Rym: I wouldn't say all.

1342
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:18,647
Scott: I would say there was at one point a group of people near us who suggested, well, because

1343
01:08:18,707 --> 01:08:30,636
Rym: everyone else had left and the convention was closed and we were still there because we did the classic trick of just stand there until everyone else leaves around you and then the doors close around you and now you're still inside

1344
01:08:30,657 --> 01:08:31,701
Scott: and now the train is gone.

1345
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,685
Scott: You need to use the tram.

1346
01:08:32,705 --> 01:08:32,886
Rym: Yeah.

1347
01:08:32,926 --> 01:08:36,279
Rym: My mom sent us a, she's texted me.

1348
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,685
Rym: She was like, I don't know.

1349
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:39,631
Rym: I didn't say it out loud at any point.

1350
01:08:39,673 --> 01:08:40,756
Rym: This is the first time I've ever said it.

1351
01:08:40,777 --> 01:08:41,781
Scott: It's like my internet name.

1352
01:08:41,821 --> 01:08:42,624
Scott: It's not a name you say.

1353
01:08:43,448 --> 01:08:44,050
Scott: Yeah.

1354
01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:46,139
Rym: She tweeted at us.

1355
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,404
Rym: She was like, yeah, dogs.

1356
01:08:47,505 --> 01:08:49,091
Rym: Last train out of Dodge just left.

1357
01:08:49,675 --> 01:08:50,618
Rym: And I was like, fucks.

1358
01:08:52,001 --> 01:08:53,024
Scott: Tram is much slower.

1359
01:08:53,246 --> 01:08:58,126
Rym: Yeah, but the tram was all packs and it was all the people that we kind of accidentally kept.

1360
01:08:58,166 --> 01:09:00,917
Scott: We had good times on trams or trains with other people.

1361
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:03,104
Rym: Yes, actually really good times.

1362
01:09:03,245 --> 01:09:12,904
Rym: We basically gave impromptu GeekNights shows slash panels on the tram for a surprisingly captive audience in that they couldn't get off the tram.

1363
01:09:13,145 --> 01:09:13,367
Scott: Yeah.

1364
01:09:13,527 --> 01:09:20,656
Rym: So, but this group of people that was left was mostly GeekNights listeners and they were like, yeah, why don't you kickstart it?

1365
01:09:20,676 --> 01:09:21,700
Rym: We would all contribute to that.

1366
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:22,483
Rym: We're like, yeah, right.

1367
01:09:22,502 --> 01:09:23,407
Rym: And they were like, no, really.

1368
01:09:23,447 --> 01:09:24,732
Rym: We would really contribute to that.

1369
01:09:24,752 --> 01:09:25,153
Rym: Really do it.

1370
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:26,840
Scott: I don't know if that's a thing you can kickstart.

1371
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:27,683
Scott: Buy me a trip to Australia.

1372
01:09:27,703 --> 01:09:30,234
Rym: Do you know how many kickstarters I've seen that are that?

1373
01:09:30,575 --> 01:09:43,126
Rym: The kickstarter would be, we will go to PAXOS 2014, do a panel at it, do a live GeekNights recording at it, and then the stretch goals will be things like we'll visit Sydney and do a meetup.

1374
01:09:43,648 --> 01:09:48,265
Scott: Why don't we ask our friends who work at kickstarter for advice in that department?

1375
01:09:48,426 --> 01:09:52,241
Rym: I looked at several kickstarters that were, what did you do?

1376
01:09:52,261 --> 01:09:55,033
Rym: There are so many kickstarters that are literally that.

1377
01:09:55,133 --> 01:09:55,836
Rym: What'd you do?

1378
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:56,981
Rym: We could do that.

1379
01:09:57,001 --> 01:10:00,879
Rym: What are you going to interrupt the show to note that I knocked the Marantz over and unplugged it?

1380
01:10:02,421 --> 01:10:03,566
Rym: Uh, it's battery powered.

1381
01:10:03,948 --> 01:10:05,133
Rym: It's still recorded everything.

1382
01:10:05,836 --> 01:10:06,318
Scott: Okay.

1383
01:10:06,398 --> 01:10:09,571
Rym: We're not backing up this last two minutes of the show.

1384
01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:11,037
Scott: Let's just end the show now.

1385
01:10:11,077 --> 01:10:11,820
Rym: Don't end the show now.

1386
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,048
Scott: What else do you have to say about PAX Australia?

1387
01:10:14,229 --> 01:10:19,650
Rym: I got a lot to say about PAX Australia, but I think it's better served by a straight up Australia show at this point.

1388
01:10:19,871 --> 01:10:23,767
Scott: Yeah, we pretty much, oh, the Megathon finale was the big Jenga that they always use.

1389
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:26,599
Rym: Yeah, which to the crowd there was off the hook.

1390
01:10:26,779 --> 01:10:28,205
Scott: But to us it was a cop out.

1391
01:10:28,245 --> 01:10:30,333
Rym: I've seen that before and it wasn't even the final round.

1392
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:30,735
Rym: Yeah.

1393
01:10:30,795 --> 01:10:34,830
Rym: I can understand why though because after the incident at the last PAX.

1394
01:10:34,871 --> 01:10:37,601
Scott: And you're out of showgrounds, pretty much anything you try will fail.

1395
01:10:37,762 --> 01:10:40,312
Scott: So great job with the pinball fake out.

1396
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:41,316
Rym: Oh my God.

1397
01:10:41,477 --> 01:10:44,770
Rym: The thing is it got you, it got you and it didn't get me captain.

1398
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:45,413
Rym: All right.

1399
01:10:45,453 --> 01:10:46,838
Rym: You were like, it's pinball, it's pinball.

1400
01:10:46,858 --> 01:10:48,063
Rym: I was like, there's no way it's pinball.

1401
01:10:48,264 --> 01:10:54,951
Rym: Do you think, do you really believe Scott Rubin that Robert Koo, the man who is the genius at this kind of thing?

1402
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:57,983
Scott: I thought, okay, I was thinking that obviously not that dumb.

1403
01:10:58,364 --> 01:11:09,147
Scott: I was thinking the surprise would be what pinball it was and not well, there was that Metallica pinball in the expo, which was surprising because those are, that's like the newest pinball.

1404
01:11:09,207 --> 01:11:10,151
Rym: It was in the big top, right?

1405
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:11,737
Scott: But it's kind of rare that pinball machine.

1406
01:11:11,797 --> 01:11:14,066
Scott: It's like they only made so many of them on earth.

1407
01:11:14,147 --> 01:11:14,990
Scott: So they have that many on.

1408
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:15,914
Scott: Australia was a big deal.

1409
01:11:16,094 --> 01:11:16,918
Rym: There's just a row of them.

1410
01:11:16,938 --> 01:11:17,882
Rym: You could play them for charity.

1411
01:11:18,082 --> 01:11:24,589
Scott: Yeah, but no, I thought it was going to be like custom penny arcade pinball table or something insane like that.

1412
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:34,930
Rym: But you thought that they would be so careless as to cover the pinball machine with a sheet, a form hugging sheet that made it obvious it was a pinball.

1413
01:11:35,271 --> 01:11:37,882
Rym: I was sure from the second I saw that it was a fake out.

1414
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:43,986
Scott: I was thinking it could be pinball and the surprise of it would not be that it was pinball, but what pinball?

1415
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:48,726
Scott: and he would freak out because of what pinball it was and not the fact that it was pinball.

1416
01:11:48,806 --> 01:11:51,699
Rym: Also pinball would not have been that interesting to watch.

1417
01:11:52,761 --> 01:11:53,304
Rym: Crane game.

1418
01:11:53,324 --> 01:11:54,087
Scott: That's true.

1419
01:11:54,167 --> 01:11:54,750
Scott: That's true.

1420
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:55,694
Scott: You do have that.

1421
01:11:55,754 --> 01:11:56,819
Rym: There were too many factors.

1422
01:11:56,839 --> 01:11:58,847
Rym: There was no way, no way.

1423
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,574
Scott: I did not consider that.

1424
01:12:00,674 --> 01:12:11,177
Rym: if I had done so, I would have realized, but when they went around with the traditional guess what the omega finale will be, I'm very happy to report that multiple people had written knifey spoonie.

1425
01:12:16,393 --> 01:12:23,225
Rym: So yeah, maybe, maybe not coming back to PaxOz 2014, but I will not pay for it with my own money.

1426
01:12:23,245 --> 01:12:26,920
Rym: I might cause I might have some work excuses to go to Australia anyway.

1427
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:27,783
Scott: It's not your own money.

1428
01:12:27,803 --> 01:12:28,626
Scott: That's a company.

1429
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:31,599
Rym: So if I'm there, I'll pay my own money for all the other stuff.

1430
01:12:31,699 --> 01:12:35,354
Scott: Yeah, but I'm not paying for my own money for a $2,000 round trip plane ticket.

1431
01:12:35,836 --> 01:12:36,760
Scott: That's not happening again.

1432
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:37,442
Rym: Whatevs.

1433
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:38,667
Rym: That's not even a month's rent.

1434
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:39,591
Scott: Not next year anyway.

1435
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:42,944
Scott: Unless maybe, I mean, I could win a lottery for it with a ticket I did not buy.

1436
01:12:43,165 --> 01:12:45,011
Scott: Maybe I will find a lottery ticket on the ground.

1437
01:12:45,051 --> 01:12:46,416
Scott: Someone else bought and discarded.

1438
01:12:46,657 --> 01:12:47,480
Scott: that will happen to win.

1439
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:50,914
Rym: My office did the pool as usual and I did not contribute.

1440
01:12:51,015 --> 01:12:52,200
Scott: Of course you are wise.

1441
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,709
Scott: You will spend your dollars on an app on steam.

1442
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,095
Rym: There was a FARC story.

1443
01:12:56,115 --> 01:12:59,067
Rym: I forget when, but I remember reading about this.

1444
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:02,320
Rym: A guy didn't go into the pool and his office won like $10 million.

1445
01:13:03,821 --> 01:13:03,921
Rym: Yep.

1446
01:13:04,404 --> 01:13:04,525
Rym: Yeah.

1447
01:13:04,545 --> 01:13:06,700
Rym: I don't want to be that guy, but I still didn't give him my five bucks.

1448
01:13:07,102 --> 01:13:09,714
Scott: What if you're that guy and everyone in your company quits?

1449
01:13:09,895 --> 01:13:13,066
Rym: I think if that happens, they might just give me some money anyway.

1450
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:13,849
Rym: That's what I'm holding out on.

1451
01:13:15,356 --> 01:13:16,360
Scott: How much do you think they'll give you?

1452
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,668
Rym: I don't know.

1453
01:13:18,909 --> 01:13:23,747
Scott: Imagine if you were in it and another guy at your company, think about the person at your company is the most annoying.

1454
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:24,068
Scott: You know what?

1455
01:13:24,129 --> 01:13:25,455
Rym: If it's a small company.

1456
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:27,363
Scott: They didn't put any money in it, where do you need to give them?

1457
01:13:27,383 --> 01:13:28,347
Rym: Well, it's the annoying guy.

1458
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:28,809
Rym: So zero.

1459
01:13:28,829 --> 01:13:29,331
Rym: Okay.

1460
01:13:29,673 --> 01:13:30,356
Rym: You're the annoying guy.

1461
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:31,139
Rym: I'm not the annoying guy.

1462
01:13:31,401 --> 01:13:32,485
Scott: You are.

1463
01:13:32,706 --> 01:13:33,509
Rym: I'm the weird guy.

1464
01:13:33,529 --> 01:13:34,413
Rym: I'm not the annoying guy.

1465
01:13:34,433 --> 01:13:34,855
Scott: You're fine.

1466
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:36,100
Scott: The weirdest guy besides you.

1467
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,711
Rym: The weirdest guy might get some money because he's so weird.

1468
01:13:38,751 --> 01:13:40,820
Rym: Everyone's afraid that he's going to go weird one day.

1469
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:41,304
Scott: No.

1470
01:13:42,196 --> 01:13:42,520
Scott: We're done.

1471
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,850
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1472
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:55,860
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1473
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:01,280
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1474
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:04,232
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1475
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:08,939
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1476
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:12,476
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1477
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:16,780
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1478
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,900
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
