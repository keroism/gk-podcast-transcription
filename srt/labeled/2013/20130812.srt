1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,165
Rym: It's Monday August 12th 2013.

2
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:16,229
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,430
Rym: Scott and Google glass.

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,450
Rym: Let's do this in front of a live studio audience.

5
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:32,110
Rym: We've got some friends over in the other room probably listening to a shout into our microphones with the door open.

6
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:34,859
Rym: Yeah, yeah, that's how we roll here.

7
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:43,590
Rym: So while we were at the beach Wildwood and I got to say I've been going to Wildwood, New Jersey, which used to have a pretty great arcade culture.

8
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:45,782
Rym: In fact, I think we've talked about this on old GeekNights.

9
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:49,690
Rym: There used to be DDR machines up and down the boardwalk.

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,170
Rym: We would literally spend the morning at the beach and spend the entire evening playing games in arcades.

11
00:00:55,812 --> 00:01:10,398
Rym: I think I must have dumped hundreds of dollars over the years total in all these things police 9-1-1 DDR mostly DDR sometimes air hockey and Yeah as of last year there are exactly zero DDR machines on the boardwalk.

12
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:13,530
Rym: In fact, the majority of the arcade don't even have a pump machine anymore.

13
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:16,830
Rym: I know they don't even have in the groove machines.

14
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:17,812
Scott: They don't have.

15
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:24,990
Scott: the only game I saw that was like a real game was that one time crisis 3 machine that was for sale.

16
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,918
Rym: Yeah, the arcade was trying to sell it.

17
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:27,641
Scott: I guess there was a Ms.

18
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:28,565
Scott: Pac-man I guess.

19
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:28,987
Rym: Yeah that Ms.

20
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:29,670
Rym: Pac-man didn't work.

21
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:30,318
Rym: I checked it out.

22
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:37,000
Rym: Oh There's also that Kind of all the really stylish looking Pac-man versus game.

23
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,365
Rym: That's actually a shit game.

24
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:39,950
Scott: Oh Pac-man battle royale.

25
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,336
Rym: I feel like the arcade that bought.

26
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:43,103
Rym: that feels really dumb about buying.

27
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,670
Scott: No, they probably make a bunch of money on it.

28
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,521
Rym: Oh, why didn't see anyone playing it?

29
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:47,850
Scott: We were there for a minute.

30
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:49,215
Scott: Yeah, everyone is playing.

31
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,910
Scott: the other the Pac-man with a million the air hockey Pac-man with a million pucks.

32
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,355
Rym: Yeah, two little kids were playing that.

33
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:56,303
Scott: Oh, how family was playing it.

34
00:01:56,464 --> 00:02:00,123
Scott: Yeah that game not so great No, but it's good on paper.

35
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:02,374
Rym: It's just so sad.

36
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:06,770
Scott: I like Pac-man and I like air hockey, but that Pac-man game is butt.

37
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:09,464
Rym: Yep, like the buttest of butt.

38
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:09,866
Scott: Yep.

39
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,219
Rym: But yeah arcades are dead at least in the US.

40
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:23,389
Rym: but we can at least say one thing we went to our arcades in Australia and They were about at the level of the few remaining arcades in the US that aren't butt.

41
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:31,510
Rym: Maybe slightly better because they had Mario Kart, but it doesn't count for much because the Mario Kart arcade machine is actually pretty butt.

42
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:35,492
Scott: Yeah Arcades are pretty.

43
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:40,806
Scott: I mean the saddest thing about the arcades is really the mobile iPhone game arcade versions.

44
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,390
Scott: the temple run arcade machine.

45
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:42,969
Rym: Oh my god.

46
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:45,599
Scott: Arcade machine it's like that.

47
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:57,209
Rym: at least there wasn't an Angry Birds arcade machine Especially because you look at this thing and it's clearly just one of those TV touch screens and an actual Regular old computer with a case around it and a dollar thing connected to it.

48
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,469
Rym: Yeah, probably connected into a serial port in the back of said computer.

49
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:05,285
Scott: It's really just a phone with a giant touchscreen and a coin slot.

50
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:09,602
Rym: I might make some money I'll get some ooh, yes, and I'll just put those in arcades.

51
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:10,486
Scott: Sure.

52
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,560
Rym: Yeah But I have another problem in my life.

53
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:18,810
Rym: I have I got a Nexus S Phone and it's pretty much the iPhone is pretty good.

54
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,930
Rym: But I still think the Nexus S has the best physical form factor of any phone.

55
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:32,857
Scott: I think the Nokia Lumia the smaller one has the best form factor of any phone because it's basically it's like an iPod nano Construction true true and it has the best camera.

56
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:35,263
Scott: Also, that's you know, just fact.

57
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:41,583
Rym: but I got a problem that I'm on Sprint CDMA 4g but it's ymax 4g.

58
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:44,514
Rym: my phone does not support Switching to LTE.

59
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:49,050
Rym: sprint has been switching for a long time and has not switched yet not completely.

60
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,342
Rym: Basically there will be a time when my 4g will stop working.

61
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:54,105
Scott: that is true.

62
00:03:54,366 --> 00:04:00,206
Rym: and of the phones I can buy I mean, I own a Nexus 4 for world travel and I got to tell you motherfuckers who like your big phones.

63
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,779
Rym: I Cannot sit down with that thing in my pocket.

64
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,175
Scott: Yeah, someone finally wrote an article that was like, you know Look all these big phones.

65
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:08,837
Scott: What the fuck.

66
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:12,450
Scott: there's basically no small phones that are also top-of-the-line phones.

67
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:19,529
Scott: All the small phones are basically gimped in terms of you know Having the fastest CPUs are the best GPUs are the best screens or whatever?

68
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,959
Rym: No, it seems like that the iPhone consumer sentiment driving it.

69
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,090
Scott: but it's weird because I think I think it's more marketing shaping consumer demand.

70
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,545
Rym: Oh, you mean like with SUVs?

71
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:29,387
Scott: Yes Yeah.

72
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:36,338
Rym: But the people who say they prefer big phones and aren't just being facetious to troll me Seem to say one of two things.

73
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:50,645
Rym: they either say I want a big screen because I play games and watch movies on it and use it as my primary computer when I'm traveling or They say Effectively I have bad eyesight and I can't see anything on tiny phones.

74
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:54,870
Scott: go to the eye doctor If bad eyesight is hindering you in some way.

75
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:06,065
Scott: The solution is never to change your technology like increasing the resolution on your screen to a resolution That is lower than the you know The native resolution of the display or any you know and not.

76
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:07,250
Scott: that is never the right answer.

77
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,950
Scott: The right answer is always go to the eye doctor.

78
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:17,437
Scott: Right if you are modifying your technological purchasing decisions because of your visual Disability and it's not.

79
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:30,250
Scott: I mean there could be a point at which you are like You know seriously visually impaired like you're blind or near blind and you need like the magnifying A large not a large majority but a large or you need some Braille shit, right?

80
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,761
Rym: I think a surprising number of Americans for whatever reason have Significant uncorrected vision problems.

81
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:42,190
Scott: Yeah, if you have you know Like there was a guy at RIT who lived on my floor in freshman year and he was almost blind, right?

82
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:48,710
Scott: You basically had a giant magnifying thing in front of his monitor, right that dude needs technology to help him with his almost blindness.

83
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:56,200
Scott: But if you you know live your daily life and you're not almost blind You don't have a white stick dragging on the ground, right?

84
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,410
Scott: The eye doctor is your answer and not the best vibe.

85
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:06,430
Rym: Well, I do know a lot of people who have Moderate myopia or light myopia but not enough to actually prevent them from living.

86
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,629
Rym: so as a result they tend to not get glasses when they're young and get used to the world being just kind of fuzzy.

87
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:15,509
Rym: and I think that's a problem because myopia is pretty common.

88
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:21,170
Rym: And I guess I was lucky in the sense that when I was young I had myopia but it was just bad enough.

89
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:22,219
Rym: So, you know wasn't?

90
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,309
Rym: I could still live my life.

91
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:34,623
Rym: But when I first put on a pair of glasses and I could see it was like seeing through the matrix I was like, oh fuck and I basically wouldn't take those glasses off again Even though the doctor only told me to wear him like occasionally.

92
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:43,054
Rym: I was like fuck that I want to see the guys get glasses or contacts or LASIK Get something.

93
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:45,322
Scott: Yeah, that's why I do whatever the eye doctor tells you to.

94
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:49,519
Scott: All right, so news news One of the smartest news.

95
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:54,675
Scott: one of the smartest news there is okay John Carmack Our guy.

96
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,383
Scott: he was at the quake con and doing.

97
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:57,890
Scott: he was talking about pretty much everything.

98
00:06:58,592 --> 00:06:59,634
Scott: But then there was.

99
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:05,369
Scott: he announced he's going over to oculus the people with the goggles and he's gonna be the CTO over there.

100
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:08,043
Scott: I think he's still doing stuff at it.

101
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,270
Scott: I don't think he's quitting there.

102
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:16,900
Rym: I gotta say the oculus rift isn't really there yet, but in terms of 90s style immersive VR coming back.

103
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,013
Rym: It is the furthest along of any consumer thing I have ever.

104
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:27,018
Scott: basically, you know big he's winding down his little, you know space Thingy his armadillo air whatever his rockets.

105
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:27,980
Scott: Yeah all the time.

106
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,184
Scott: He was spending on the Rockets.

107
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:32,696
Scott: He's now gonna spend on the you know, the Oculus rift.

108
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,490
Rym: I actually suddenly have a lot more interest in the oculus.

109
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,140
Scott: Yeah, I mean the oculus.

110
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:44,428
Scott: basically I'm still poo-pooing it But there are so many people going in on it and giving it the thumbs up and like lifting it up.

111
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:47,077
Scott: It's like well Maybe right.

112
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:48,528
Scott: It's like I'm still poo-pooing it.

113
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:53,570
Rym: but Well, I can say one thing and I did this a couple of times as an experiment.

114
00:07:54,173 --> 00:08:03,649
Rym: But what I did back when we were playing cs16 is I set my monitor up so it was basically like right in front of my eyeball like if I couldn't really see anything but the monitor.

115
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,190
Rym: and Then what I did and I have myopia so my eye focus is really close like it's one kind of nice side effect.

116
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:10,455
Rym: So it kind of worked.

117
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:15,874
Rym: and then what I did is I put on an eyepatch on one of my eyes Mm-hmm, and you know what that did.

118
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:22,310
Rym: it made everything feel so crazy real in 3d that it was almost disorienting to play counter-strike.

119
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:28,601
Scott: Well, I remember the first time I played descent one of the first 3d games I played on an old DOS PC back in the 90s like 97 or 98 whatever.

120
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:33,138
Scott: I was getting dizzy because that's a full.

121
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:34,443
Scott: that's a real 3d game.

122
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:35,929
Scott: Like you can go in every facing.

123
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:41,370
Rym: Yeah, I'm not disoriented like dizzy disoriented like it was too real and I would flinch when thing like bumped into things.

124
00:08:41,832 --> 00:08:42,494
Scott: Oh that could happen.

125
00:08:42,514 --> 00:08:43,035
Scott: I could see that.

126
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:44,301
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's like.

127
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:51,610
Scott: yeah, and the oculus is like full HD Right, and I'm pretty sure it's 3d like, you know a movie is you never put it on in a con.

128
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,417
Scott: I think I put it on at PAX for a few minutes.

129
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,927
Scott: But yeah, it's 3d right like a movie which is.

130
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,100
Scott: you know that is an advancement right.

131
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,249
Scott: those the the Basically the virtual realities of the 90s were just TV screens and your eyeballs that weren't HD and weren't 3d.

132
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:09,843
Scott: So it is a significant improvement, but it's still this Gigantic thing you put on your face.

133
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:12,835
Scott: fine with that It's too big.

134
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:13,700
Rym: Why is it too big?

135
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:16,822
Rym: but smaller than my monitor maybe.

136
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:20,722
Scott: But I mean you're wearing I mean Google Glass.

137
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:20,903
Scott: was?

138
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:25,670
Scott: he weighs nothing on your face But Google Glass you were outside if you were oculus rift outside your moron.

139
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:32,710
Rym: Obviously though Imagine this I could sit down with just a TV tray on an airplane or a train.

140
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,538
Scott: Yeah on an airplane or in the park.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,350
Scott: You need power for I think needs to be plugged in though.

142
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:39,259
Scott: Yeah, I'm not sure about that.

143
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,610
Rym: It's not yeah what you think it's gonna just be powered from USB.

144
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:44,285
Scott: It could have a big-ass battery that you're wearing on your face.

145
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,936
Scott: Not really Yeah, I don't know.

146
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:48,800
Scott: I'm still just.

147
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,610
Scott: I mean I've seen this before.

148
00:09:50,750 --> 00:10:01,007
Scott: I think this can get to a point to where like if they shave like a couple inches off the front You know and a couple pounds off of it, then it'd be like holy shit, but it's not.

149
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:01,890
Rym: I think it's there.

150
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:02,515
Rym: It's just.

151
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:03,929
Rym: it's only there right now.

152
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:13,433
Rym: It's at the level that the hardcore like like the people who bought the super nice TVs Before they were cheaper and a little bit better Like the.

153
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:20,339
Rym: the people are on the edge of that curve either because they really care about their PC gaming or they really care about These VR sort of experiences.

154
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,285
Rym: It's there for them.

155
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:21,909
Rym: It's already there.

156
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,839
Rym: It's only not there for the kind of super mass market.

157
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,974
Rym: for the reasons who said I have been considering getting one Go for it.

158
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:33,734
Scott: The other thing about the oculus is that if you look at the games that are hot right now It's like sure.

159
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:35,139
Scott: This is great for some Counter-Strike.

160
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,062
Rym: I see we're getting at.

161
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:38,350
Scott: what does this do for you in your League of Legends?

162
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,898
Scott: It's nothing nothing.

163
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:41,970
Scott: It does but nothing right?

164
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:50,806
Scott: So I think either a there aren't gonna be the games that are with the first-person perspective oculus or be.

165
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:58,206
Scott: There will suddenly be a bunch of people making more first-person perspective games to support the two things.

166
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:03,444
Rym: one if you Remade tie fighter, of course where you could look around the cockpit.

167
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,207
Scott: Are you kidding me?

168
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:07,867
Rym: Yeah All my money just take it.

169
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:12,503
Rym: But to with a MOBA or a 2d game.

170
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:14,590
Rym: a clever person could use it.

171
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,201
Rym: Imagine this you put oculus on right.

172
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:17,550
Rym: it tracks your head movements.

173
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:21,870
Scott: They already have things you can buy that are head trackers that aren't God.

174
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:39,772
Rym: oh, yeah, but I'm saying having the goggles there basically means that you have an infinite canvas to put information and monitors and things around you spatially to where you look to the left and you've got like all the stats for the Game and you look to the right and you've got your map and you look to the middle and you've got your guy in the Fighting.

175
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:40,717
Rym: you look up and you've got it.

176
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:54,709
Rym: You could zoom in and out you could do cool stuff But I don't see these games doing those kinds of things Because the people who play these games seem to get off having one oculus Having one oculus rift can simulate having like ten monitors.

177
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:58,386
Rym: Yes You can basically be like I want a monitor floating right here.

178
00:11:58,406 --> 00:11:59,170
Rym: at this angle.

179
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,521
Scott: You can see all the judges doing everyday computing.

180
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:05,437
Scott: You can see all your virtual desktops are basically Splayed out in different areas.

181
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:06,220
Scott: Oh, that's Adam.

182
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,983
Rym: That's a future.

183
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,990
Rym: I sit down at my desk and there aren't any monitors.

184
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,585
Rym: Yep, and the real future is I'm wearing Google Glass version 5.0.

185
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:15,210
Scott: that I think here's the thing, right?

186
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,450
Scott: I think we better to not have this oculus rift for the weight is on your head.

187
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:30,310
Scott: I think it would be better to have it more like in Ghost in the Shell or when they sit down in that one room And the basically the eyeball things are attached to the wall or the floor and they just sort of lean into it more like

188
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:31,700
Rym: But they can't move their head around.

189
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,988
Rym: you lose that spatial dimension.

190
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,610
Scott: They're not playing FPS is they're computing by looking into that.

191
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,333
Rym: But they're right.

192
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:43,410
Rym: the ghost in the shell gets into the idea that they're doing that for a different reason.

193
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,987
Rym: they bring this up several times at least in standalone complex that they do that just because there's.

194
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:56,007
Rym: they're Overloading data into the optic nerve because that area is just the highest resolution interface into a human that is relatively safe.

195
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:56,769
Scott: Mm-hmm.

196
00:12:57,796 --> 00:12:59,210
Rym: But yeah, I think there's different cases for it.

197
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:06,100
Rym: I think there's the the overlay view and then there's the immersion view and I think we will need dedicated hardware for that until we Have brain interfaces.

198
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,190
Scott: Mm-hmm I guess I still think it would be nice to go to work and just sort of you know Sit comfortably in a thing where the thing is in my face.

199
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:17,070
Rym: When we used to GeekNights, you'd like lay backwards with your eyes closed, right?

200
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,669
Scott: I just don't like the idea of the weight being on my head neck, right?

201
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,267
Rym: Boom that I pull down and attached to my face but still tracks my movement.

202
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:26,889
Scott: I could be cool.

203
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,854
Scott: It would just be.

204
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:33,010
Scott: sort of you know, that would be clumsy like having the freaking racing seat in your house.

205
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:39,285
Rym: You know with the for the racing games For someone like us where this shit matters and is a central part of our life.

206
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,450
Rym: I want the Darth Vader pod.

207
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,203
Rym: Anyway, I just want to be in the Darth Vader pod.

208
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:48,410
Rym: I pull my helmet down I stick my hand and the whole thing seals you in yeah, and I move everything.

209
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,589
Rym: I'm just moving my arms and hands around and everything's haptic and visual and immersive, you know Darth Vader doesn't there?

210
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:58,515
Scott: Not what you're describing though.

211
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:02,953
Rym: he is moving his arms around I know but I'm saying I want the equivalent of that and I'd be fine With that.

212
00:14:03,315 --> 00:14:03,939
Scott: I'd be fine.

213
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,510
Scott: Are you gonna put that in your tiny apartment?

214
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:11,330
Rym: I would fill this room with it great and you'd get to the huge and it wouldn't matter if you're physically next to me anymore.

215
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:13,359
Rym: You can sit in the other room already doesn't matter.

216
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,705
Scott: I'm not physically next exactly.

217
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:15,730
Rym: So I just run an excellent.

218
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,634
Scott: I don't even come here.

219
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:19,990
Scott: Let's just Skype for now on cuz Skype is shit audio quality.

220
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:25,128
Rym: So very briefly I want to point out a couple little things.

221
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:30,289
Rym: one The Department of Transportation in the US is actually doing something really cool to the federal DoT.

222
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:39,779
Rym: yes in the US and I highly recommend all of you pay attention to this because this is gonna come sooner than you realize and Everyone who says privacy stuff shut up.

223
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,830
Rym: I'm more as much as I care about the NSA stuff.

224
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:48,530
Rym: This stuff is separate in the sense that we need this regardless of if we fix the NSA stuff.

225
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:56,872
Rym: They want to standardize on the in the nation the way that cars communicate with each other and with the road reason point.

226
00:14:56,953 --> 00:15:09,850
Rym: imagine if all the cars on the road were constantly generating telemetry data and traffic data and Automatically updating a standard interface for GPS direction navigation things to reroute cars if there's a problem.

227
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:14,098
Rym: So if there's an accident cars Immediately are rerouted to alternate roads.

228
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,462
Scott: This is your favorite thing.

229
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:19,113
Scott: fixed protocol for cars exactly exactly I I.

230
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:36,510
Rym: yeah 39 equals 3. so the other news I like to talk about is that there's been a rash of dark mail or silent mail or Secure email services going down either because of secret government bullshit that they can't talk about and wall.

231
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,619
Rym: I think these people should fight so far.

232
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,149
Rym: I saw one so another one shut down.

233
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:45,063
Rym: They didn't say if it was because of the gut because it's a rash.

234
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:45,705
Rym: Yes.

235
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:47,170
Rym: I think there's gonna be more.

236
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:59,270
Rym: I think what's going to see more spring up than shut down true, but the ones that spring up have to be Technologically secure not relying upon central servers doing one and mega has kept mega up.

237
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,788
Scott: So there you go.

238
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:13,545
Rym: I guess I bring this up only because those of you who are worried about privacy and all these issues These are little too little data points you can use to argue with other people as to why this NSA stuff is kind of toxic.

239
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:27,690
Rym: because if the Government can tell someone to shut down something that has perfectly legitimate uses because someone might use it for nefarious purposes and simultaneously That person is not allowed to even talk about what happened and we don't even know if they fight it or not.

240
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:32,383
Rym: I can't really fault the person for not fighting it because they're kind of.

241
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:35,734
Rym: that's kind of like going up against the Stasi like yeah He's a guy who's fighting it.

242
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:36,779
Scott: He just can't talk about it.

243
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:39,350
Rym: Yeah, but how do you know if you thought it then?

244
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,475
Scott: He's saying he fought it.

245
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:42,204
Scott: Yeah, something happened.

246
00:16:42,244 --> 00:16:43,390
Scott: I can't talk about but I'm fighting.

247
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,900
Rym: And things of the day I'll let you guys know right now.

248
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,895
Rym: you might have heard some clicking for the last few minutes.

249
00:16:55,418 --> 00:16:59,372
Rym: the The mixer the GeekNights' mixer might have just died.

250
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,575
Scott: You don't hear any clicking right now.

251
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:01,558
Rym: There's no more clicking.

252
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:02,100
Rym: Mm-hmm.

253
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:11,657
Rym: so we have plugged directly into my fire studio interface for the time being and We'll see if the audio sounds different cuz I'm gonna have to master everything very differently now.

254
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,567
Rym: And yeah, I have to buy a new mixer.

255
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:15,832
Scott: We'll see what happens there.

256
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:16,714
Scott: We should kickstart it.

257
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:21,880
Scott: Yeah Okay, so thing of the day.

258
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:26,826
Scott: We've been waiting a long time, but finally It's gonna happen.

259
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:27,849
Scott: It's gonna happen.

260
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:38,041
Scott: the English version of Hatsune Miku V3 English using Vocaloid 3 is now slated to be available for download on August 31st 2013.

261
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,007
Rym: the I'm actually kind of excited about this.

262
00:17:41,248 --> 00:17:52,656
Scott: the bundle with vocal editor Pia Pro Studio vsti and Presonus studio one artist Pia Pro Edition and over 200 virtual instruments.

263
00:17:52,877 --> 00:18:00,724
Scott: Hopefully including the swan For immediate music production goes for 150 US dollars.

264
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:06,220
Scott: that's basically zero for software like that for basically software that allow you to make all the musics.

265
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:08,368
Scott: I don't know how to make the musics.

266
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:09,714
Scott: I don't have the music skills.

267
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:11,260
Scott: My music skills are very low.

268
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:22,359
Scott: I mean, they're higher than you know zero but because I did a lot of musics when I was in elementary middle high schools But I haven't done any really since then unless you count like guitar here or DDR.

269
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:25,720
Scott: So my music skills are pretty low.

270
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:30,080
Scott: So I feel like if I bought it for 150 it would be sort of like up not using it for anything.

271
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,327
Scott: What a waste of money that was.

272
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:33,560
Rym: I could buy it, but I don't have a good project for it.

273
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:42,588
Rym: I haven't written a long time and yes, I could transcribe Existing popular songs and do what everyone else is gonna do with it But I still feel like I should buy it.

274
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,034
Rym: Anyway, you know we could do.

275
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,772
Rym: we could use it Cleverly in GeekNights, maybe yeah, I'll make the new geek.

276
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:49,556
Scott: that's theme song.

277
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:50,540
Scott: Miku will sing it for us.

278
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,520
Rym: Yeah, we'll use it as we could use it to add a third host.

279
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:57,595
Scott: But anyway, there's some demo videos here on YouTube.

280
00:18:57,615 --> 00:18:58,480
Scott: You can hear what it sounds like.

281
00:18:58,662 --> 00:18:59,637
Rym: You know we could use it for this.

282
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,665
Rym: It sounds kind of dumb.

283
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,140
Rym: we could have it every time we want to quote something from an article.

284
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:04,857
Rym: Just have Miku sing it on the show instead.

285
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:08,176
Rym: Mmm, that might be really annoying really quickly.

286
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:08,799
Scott: We'll see.

287
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:12,584
Scott: But yeah Awesomeness times a million.

288
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:16,560
Rym: All right, so this is a cool and creepy art installation.

289
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:35,500
Rym: Someone took not one not two daddy three PP but a matrix of Three by I gotta expand this window to see how big it is three by five Teddy Ruxpin's 15 Teddy Ruxpin's and made an art installation where they just kind of say creepy stuff.

290
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,036
Scott: Well, isn't he just a cassette player?

291
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,559
Scott: So it's basically you're hanging a teddy bear shaped cassette player on the wall 15 of them and having them play.

292
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,190
Rym: Teddy Ruxpin did more than just play tapes.

293
00:19:45,231 --> 00:20:00,180
Rym: Teddy Ruxpin on one of the audio channels had someone telling a story and on the other audio channel had command and control for moving his eyes moving his mouth or Making another accessory another guy you could get that would connect to him also move around and do stuff.

294
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:06,192
Scott: So basically it was had stereo audio but a mono speaker and the right or the left would have the.

295
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:09,770
Scott: yeah when I was what he was saying it would just play It over the one speaker and the other.

296
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,019
Rym: if you played the other side It would play this kind of like buzzing noise.

297
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:18,118
Scott: Yeah, the other channel would just sort of you know play data that would make him move.

298
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:26,821
Rym: exactly I bring it up one cuz it's kind of cool and two people are really into like chip bending or all these sort of you know Cool Things.

299
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:28,286
Scott: you wouldn't even need a cassette tape.

300
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:31,215
Scott: you'd be better off with sticking an Arduino inside.

301
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:32,740
Rym: that appears to be what they did here.

302
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:42,676
Scott: Okay, and just controlling him directly without shitty cassette tape exactly and then playing one audio track on speakers nearby With an mp3 or something.

303
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:53,120
Rym: Yeah I just I bring this up only because it's kind of a cool way to use an old technology and to Whether or not you know or care who Teddy Ruxpin is I think says a lot about what year you were born.

304
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,712
Scott: I should do the same thing with fucking glow worms glow worm and Teddy Ruxpin together.

305
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:58,358
Rym: You gotta get every glow worm.

306
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:00,082
Scott: is my boy Really?

307
00:21:00,102 --> 00:21:01,227
Rym: Yeah, you and glow worm.

308
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:02,472
Scott: I like glow worm.

309
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:03,456
Rym: I never like glow worm.

310
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:04,260
Scott: Oh, it was the best.

311
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:05,380
Rym: I was never a fan of me.

312
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:07,469
Rym: I might have been a fan of glow worm in my pre.

313
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:17,158
Scott: I had this awesome toy where there was basically a board with all these holes in it and he had a pen and the pen had a glow worm on top and you would put The pen in the holes and even put in the right hole to glow him light up.

314
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:24,277
Rym: So yeah, but also you could just put other cassettes and Teddy Ruxpin and he would just kind of play him But he wouldn't move wouldn't really move.

315
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:27,308
Rym: No So yeah, yeah, that's all I got.

316
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,332
Scott: He was just a cassette player.

317
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,120
Scott: All right time for the meta.

318
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:32,726
Rym: The book of the book is Stazzyland.

319
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:33,669
Rym: I'm mostly done with it.

320
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,800
Rym: It's pretty good pretty relevant NSA scary spy shit.

321
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,027
Scott: Pax prime is real soon the end of the month.

322
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,715
Rym: We are presenting on Monday at noon in the Wolfman theater.

323
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:46,120
Scott: bad games Oh shit.

324
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,340
Scott: That's the last day of packs.

325
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,793
Scott: We're gonna enjoy a bunch of packs and then sort of on this last lazy day before the omega-thon finale We're gonna do a panel.

326
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:54,480
Rym: sounds good.

327
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:57,000
Rym: Watch our videos on the internet.

328
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,988
Rym: We've already uploaded two videos from Pax Australia.

329
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:00,951
Rym: several more are coming.

330
00:22:01,512 --> 00:22:04,280
Rym: follow us on YouTube my youtube channel Scott's YouTube channel.

331
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,855
Scott: Yeah, we have a lot of things on the internet and you should go look at them.

332
00:22:07,955 --> 00:22:09,140
Scott: if you've enjoyed this show.

333
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:17,930
Scott: They are easy for you to find including one of them that is often forgotten our email newsletter Which has content that isn't really in other things.

334
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:22,729
Scott: as I write a lot of stuff in there such as a Q&A That's easy where our Q&A section is gone.

335
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:26,866
Scott: So if you want to ask us something and us to answer it That's really all in the newsletter now.

336
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:30,939
Scott: So email us GeekNights from a crew calm and then look for another newsletter.

337
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:37,430
Scott: soon I'll mail one probably this month before Pax happens and you might be answered in there.

338
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:42,303
Scott: Yeah Alright, that's the end of meta moment.

339
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:44,666
Rym: So, uh Scott got Google Glass.

340
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:49,126
Rym: I did I don't yet mostly because I Would really like to get the water.

341
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:50,551
Rym: I can put prescription glasses in it.

342
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:52,820
Rym: Yep, and that's not available yet.

343
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:58,680
Scott: Well, you know actually it comes with the shields and shades is what they call it.

344
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:09,459
Scott: It's basically sunglasses and also a clear glass that you can use just to protect your eyes if you say Biking and it in the night or something And they just sort of snap in in between the nose thingies.

345
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:10,870
Rym: Yep No, I would with

346
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:20,476
Scott: your pile of money You could get someone to make you prescription glasses that have like that little connector Thingy that would go in where the shades and shields go

347
00:23:20,496 --> 00:23:24,553
Rym: now that is true But that would be more money than I'm willing to pay especially already

348
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:25,176
Scott: spending $1,500 in the gas.

349
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:31,737
Rym: There are pretty good rumors that it'll be available more generally with the prescription glass option.

350
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:32,540
Rym: Just kind of working.

351
00:23:33,864 --> 00:23:35,139
Rym: Not that too far out.

352
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,860
Scott: Yeah The rumor that's going around now is that it'll be available by the end of the year for 300 bucks and you know what?

353
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,086
Scott: That's kind of annoying because I just spent 1500.

354
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:45,954
Scott: It's been five times that right?

355
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:50,820
Scott: not the early adopter tax Yeah, but I mean that's a huge early adopter tax.

356
00:23:51,302 --> 00:23:54,900
Scott: It was like oh I paid five hundred and they paid three hundred or I even if I paid seven.

357
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:58,803
Rym: I don't think the three hundred dollars is a legitimate rumor even if it is.

358
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:04,631
Scott: I would be okay with it if because basically if you look at the updates that Google Glass gets they're all labeled as like.

359
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:07,233
Scott: Let me look for a second.

360
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:07,879
Scott: I'm loading it up.

361
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:13,136
Scott: I'm currently running xe8, which is Explorer Edition 8, right?

362
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:21,162
Scott: So if I continue to get Explorer Edition updates and everyone else gets sort of like less updates then it's like oh, okay I get it.

363
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:22,271
Scott: I'm an Explorer Edition.

364
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,460
Scott: I'm basically in the beta.

365
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,346
Scott: I always get you know the sort of like.

366
00:24:25,386 --> 00:24:29,059
Scott: if you pay $100 to Apple to be a developer you keep getting more.

367
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:29,400
Scott: you get.

368
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:35,620
Scott: You know, you're using iOS whatever it is right now the new version, you know Because you have to make apps for it before it comes out.

369
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,432
Scott: So you get the new version early when it's beta.

370
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:43,179
Scott: that would be okay That would be yeah I spent more money on it and I basically ahead of the curve on my Google Glass.

371
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:47,277
Scott: That is something I'm you know would not be upset if they even if they came out with $300 Google Glass.

372
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,900
Scott: Also, you got to consider, you know, those shades and shields came in a separate thing.

373
00:24:53,683 --> 00:24:55,310
Scott: You know, they're gonna charge extra for that shit.

374
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,820
Scott: I basically got the full set like a fully loaded car.

375
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:04,180
Scott: I think if you buy Google Glass at retail all that other stuff is gonna be like add-ons that cost more money.

376
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:15,813
Scott: the only thing that was actually in the package with the Google Glass was like the carrying case and a USB cable and Not much else, right?

377
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:17,140
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much all you got.

378
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:22,060
Scott: So everything else that you would want for Google Glass is gonna be probably separate monies.

379
00:25:22,642 --> 00:25:32,236
Scott: So if you know, even if it is 300 if they charge like 50 bucks each shades and shields, it's really 400 You know, so hmm plus they could charge a lot more for that.

380
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:33,160
Scott: sunglasses are expensive.

381
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,859
Scott: Yeah, they could charge a hundred each for those who knows what they're gonna do.

382
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:38,713
Rym: So it's hard to say what'll happen with that where I'm just gonna wait.

383
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:40,140
Rym: I'm in no rush right now.

384
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:49,935
Scott: Well, I'm in a rush, but I'm not in that much of a rush all right, so a lot of people now that I have the Google Glass and I've been using it for Week about yeah, I got it last Wednesday.

385
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:53,114
Scott: I think yeah last Wednesday We can pretty much talk about.

386
00:25:53,155 --> 00:26:01,280
Scott: a lot of people Really don't understand what it currently is what it is capable of what it does because they haven't had it.

387
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,269
Scott: They haven't really read tech articles that really describe it.

388
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:08,080
Scott: Even those articles don't really, you know fully explain it.

389
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:14,149
Scott: Like I say it's not an augmented reality overlay Obviously right, so here's what Google Glass is.

390
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:17,400
Scott: so it weighs about as much as glasses, right?

391
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:21,261
Scott: It's not really bothersome to wear It's.

392
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:28,200
Scott: and what it does is it basically puts a little tiny screen up in the top right corner of your vision, right?

393
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,285
Scott: it's in your peripheral vision not in your main vision and most of the time it's just off.

394
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:43,287
Scott: and when it's off basically and your peripheral vision is a little blurry spot where the piece of Glasses and that's all it does and only when you turn it on Which I'm just did.

395
00:26:43,307 --> 00:26:46,780
Rym: I want so observations from someone around someone with the Google Glass.

396
00:26:47,061 --> 00:26:50,679
Rym: You will see Google Glass people periodically just jerking their net back like whoop.

397
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,747
Scott: Yeah one way there are two ways to turn it on.

398
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:59,511
Scott: one way to turn on is to jerk your neck backwards to look up at The sky and you can set the angle of sort of attack.

399
00:26:59,893 --> 00:27:01,859
Scott: So I said I left mine to the default of 30 degrees.

400
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,999
Scott: I tried lowering it because it wasn't working but then that was too much.

401
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:06,891
Scott: I put it at 20. that wasn't good.

402
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:08,380
Scott: So I put it back at 30 and it's okay.

403
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:14,439
Scott: And basically I tilt my head back 30 degrees and it turns on right and I can now see basically a clock.

404
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,828
Scott: Great it's 629.

405
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:18,390
Rym: that was worth it.

406
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:18,712
Rym: Isn't it?

407
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:19,034
Rym: That is 629.

408
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:20,623
Rym: That is correct One.

409
00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:22,320
Rym: you have a very expensive pocket watch.

410
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,131
Scott: It is a very one thing Google Glass is is a watch.

411
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:31,298
Scott: if you have a watch and you have Google Glass You don't need it and it prevents you from a having anything on your wrist.

412
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,534
Rym: instead You have something on your head, but you have a pebble on your wrist.

413
00:27:34,815 --> 00:27:35,619
Scott: I don't have it on now.

414
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:39,986
Scott: The pebble watch is completely Unnecessary if you have Google Glass.

415
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,171
Rym: I'll buy it from you for a dollar.

416
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:42,878
Scott: No, they're mute now.

417
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:43,501
Rym: 250.

418
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:46,112
Scott: No, they're mutually exclusive devices, right and two.

419
00:27:46,152 --> 00:27:47,517
Scott: you don't need to take your phone out of your pocket.

420
00:27:47,537 --> 00:27:48,100
Scott: Okay?

421
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:50,164
Scott: So it's a wristwatch.

422
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:50,867
Scott: That's one thing.

423
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:53,900
Scott: it is right and all this is a little tiny rectangular screen.

424
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:57,260
Scott: So it's sort of like, you know how you have a second monitor on your computer.

425
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,740
Scott: It's like having a second monitor on your phone, but it's just always there.

426
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,460
Scott: You don't have to pull your phone out of your pocket and look away, right?

427
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:03,983
Scott: It's just there.

428
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:06,580
Scott: the other way to turn it on is to tap the side of it.

429
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,734
Scott: The front right side of it is basically this touchscreen.

430
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:18,645
Scott: It's not a touchscreen it's a touchpad and it's sort of a long stick shaped touchpad and it only really has Four different things you can do.

431
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:24,059
Scott: you can swipe forward swipe back right and that basically scrolls left and right or up and down.

432
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:32,040
Scott: You can swipe downwards which is sort of like quickly and that is sort of like dismiss Which is like pushing the home button on your iPhone, right?

433
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:39,065
Scott: So like go back go back or turn off and then you can also tap it and that's like clicking like select that option That I just looked at.

434
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,071
Scott: select that option.

435
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:41,620
Scott: All right, that's that's what that's all about.

436
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:46,040
Scott: There are some apps where you do a two finger scroll like the web browser.

437
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:48,285
Scott: That's pretty rare though.

438
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:56,151
Scott: It's mostly just the one finger swipe forward swipe back down and tap Okay, so what do you use it for right now?

439
00:28:56,412 --> 00:28:58,780
Scott: right now, this is the sad part of Google Glass.

440
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:04,129
Scott: I can't use it for all that much because a Doesn't support Google Apps.

441
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,080
Scott: It only supports regular Gmail.

442
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,000
Scott: So if your Gmail account is at gmail.com then you're all set with Google Glass.

443
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,032
Scott: You can use your Google+ and all that stuff.

444
00:29:13,113 --> 00:29:14,078
Scott: I have to turn the Google+ off.

445
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:26,913
Scott: I don't have to but if I Google+ and hung out and did all that stuff with my Google Glass it would be hanging out with my at gmail.com account or Posting to my geek G+ on my at gmail.com account.

446
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:28,420
Rym: I'm not Google.

447
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,033
Scott: I don't have anyone in my circles on my at gmail.com account.

448
00:29:32,073 --> 00:29:34,060
Rym: Google, Google, Google, Moses.

449
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:37,398
Scott: They always fuck the people using Google Apps.

450
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:42,440
Rym: guys We who use Google Apps are your hardest core users.

451
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,479
Scott: Yeah You should give the hardest core people to shit First not after everyone else or in the very least make it to where the apps.

452
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,113
Rym: people Can enable that stuff if they want to.

453
00:29:52,194 --> 00:29:56,835
Scott: even if it's off by default There is an option in Google Apps to be like give me the beta shit.

454
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:57,980
Scott: if someone checked that box.

455
00:29:58,504 --> 00:29:59,919
Scott: Give them the beta shit.

456
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:07,024
Rym: Yeah, I mean I know for a fact a lot of nerds like us use Google Apps because we have a real domain But we really the

457
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:11,141
Scott: only reason I use it is because I want my email address to not be at gmail.com But

458
00:30:11,262 --> 00:30:12,025
Rym: I want to use

459
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:13,068
Scott: all of Google services.

460
00:30:13,088 --> 00:30:16,220
Scott: I want every Gmail Google service there is possible.

461
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,088
Rym: I've basically doubled down on Google.

462
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:33,042
Scott: I use Google for pretty much everything I do on the internet except Storing and sharing pictures yep, but yes because I'm use an apps account, and I can't link that to my You know Google glass I can't do the hangouts And I can't do there.

463
00:30:33,062 --> 00:30:40,471
Scott: what the hangouts do is basically it's hangout and you can even do a video hangout where they see What you see right and you can do an audio hangout where you.

464
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:41,496
Scott: this is a microphone.

465
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:44,731
Scott: when you talk it hears you And you can I guess do it.

466
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:45,860
Scott: Maybe a text hangout?

467
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:54,057
Scott: I'm not sure if it does text to speech to text for a text hangout, but yeah You can hang out with it if you have that enabled and you can share things to g+ with it.

468
00:30:54,137 --> 00:31:00,481
Rym: so one thing I notice You seem to be taking a lot of candid photographs that you wouldn't have otherwise taken because you always just kind of have it on.

469
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:08,009
Scott: yeah, that is the one thing that I really do with it a lot is because it's not hooked up to my g+ and Because I turned off the Twitter app.

470
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:10,220
Scott: even because the Twitter app is really annoying.

471
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:14,740
Scott: It keeps showing you all these tweets, and it seemed to have randomly selected like four people.

472
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:22,765
Scott: I was following and showed me all their tweets all the time and kept even beeping and saying hey tweet someone tweeted But it didn't show me all my tweets It just chose some people.

473
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:26,600
Scott: and I'm like why did you choose those people and stop bothering me with these tweets?

474
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,106
Scott: I just want to be able to tweet.

475
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:30,216
Scott: I don't want to see tweets in my Google Glass.

476
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:31,060
Scott: That's annoying as hell.

477
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:32,379
Scott: So I turned off Twitter.

478
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:35,940
Scott: So what I did is it made a tumblr because it also works with tumblr.

479
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:42,978
Scott: So I made a tumblr just for Google Glass and I said I will share all the things From my glass to this tumblr.

480
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:49,786
Scott: now You could make that another tweet, and then I used ifttt to make the tumblr Tumblr auto tweets on its own.

481
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:51,232
Scott: Oh, well I used ifttt.

482
00:31:51,253 --> 00:31:51,855
Scott: Maybe I'll go back.

483
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,020
Rym: You can just do it in tumblr.

484
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,568
Scott: I'll just turn that off and do it in time.

485
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:58,366
Rym: if you notice how every morning at the exact same time There's I make a single tweet.

486
00:31:58,427 --> 00:31:59,431
Rym: That is just whatever.

487
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:00,978
Scott: I thought you might have been using ifttt.

488
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:11,057
Rym: Nope I actually don't have an account on ifttt anymore because once they got rid of the other direction interface for Twitter Yeah, that was the most useful thing they had.

489
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:11,781
Rym: all I used I have.

490
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:14,090
Scott: that was Twitter's fault for removing that was.

491
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:22,308
Rym: I would take everything anyone ever tweeted at me And if it had a link in it, I made myself a feed of those links in delicious Yep, and that was super useful.

492
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:24,600
Scott: But anyway, so yeah taking photos.

493
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,994
Scott: It is a camera obviously Google Glass right and there's two ways to take photos.

494
00:32:28,074 --> 00:32:35,278
Scott: is you can when you turn it on You can say okay glass and that brings up the voice activated menu, which works great And that's good if you're carrying stuff.

495
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:37,369
Scott: but there's also the button you can press.

496
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:39,197
Scott: there's a button on top of it and you press the button.

497
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:39,819
Scott: it takes a photo.

498
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,180
Scott: if You hold the button it takes a video and I just use the button a lot and You don't have to take your phone out of your pocket, right?

499
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,940
Scott: Cuz think about if you see something and it's like for example I was walking down the street and those a Maserati.

500
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:54,014
Scott: I'd take my phone out of my pocket aim it at the thing by.

501
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:55,140
Scott: that time is gone, right?

502
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,844
Scott: But instead I guys go.

503
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:56,710
Scott: boop got it.

504
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:58,019
Scott: boop got it.

505
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,139
Scott: So even though the pictures are kind of shitty you can get a lot of pictures and stuff like that.

506
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:07,280
Scott: That you can't you wouldn't normally get just because the camera is always out.

507
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,380
Rym: Oh, I got this great picture of me looking really sad playing Hanabi at the show.

508
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:12,408
Scott: That was a sad game of.

509
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:13,679
Scott: Hanabi was the saddest.

510
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:16,649
Scott: Yeah, so I tend to you know, I'm like, hey, this is kind of.

511
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:20,767
Scott: I'll just take pictures of pretty much every sort of moderately interesting you know.

512
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:24,858
Scott: moment and Tumble them into this tumbler and see what that's all about.

513
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:26,987
Scott: the way the videos work is you?

514
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:34,935
Scott: basically if you tell it to take a video it starts taking a video and Then it goes for 10 seconds, then it stops and then you can send the video can't?

515
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:36,826
Scott: there's no YouTube at all Which is annoying.

516
00:33:36,886 --> 00:33:38,738
Scott: it only goes to like G plus and stuff like that.

517
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:43,293
Scott: But if you tell it to if you tap it while it's videoing the video will.

518
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:47,930
Scott: the video limit will be removed and it'll video Forever until you stop it or the battery runs out.

519
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,480
Scott: The battery has been lasting pretty good.

520
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:55,904
Scott: I'm basically charging it the same times that I would charge my phone, you know when I'm at work I don't put it on.

521
00:33:55,985 --> 00:33:58,114
Scott: I'm not sitting with my at my desk wearing it.

522
00:33:58,134 --> 00:33:59,360
Scott: That's pointless, right?

523
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,919
Rym: See I plan to wear it all the time because I wear glasses.

524
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:09,858
Scott: I wear pretty much when I get up from my desk or when I'm walking around town or you know Pretty much all those times but I don't wear it in the shower.

525
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:16,935
Scott: or You know when I'm sitting at my desk and there's a computer in front of me There's no point in wearing the Google Glass with its current functionality.

526
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:22,880
Scott: There could be Functionality for it that would enhance your sitting at the computer experience, but none of that exists.

527
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:24,385
Scott: Maybe I'll make some.

528
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:25,491
Rym: we need or we need.

529
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:28,199
Rym: you know, we've always whenever a thing came out We're like, oh we should write some apps.

530
00:34:28,601 --> 00:34:32,576
Rym: We need to be the ones right glass apps because what I see people I'm gonna be writing some soon.

531
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:36,411
Rym: what I see people working On or saying they want now is all bullshit.

532
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:38,139
Rym: Yeah, I know what to do for glass.

533
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,139
Rym: I've been thinking about this for most of my life exactly.

534
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:46,591
Scott: So, yeah, so You know, I only wear it like.

535
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:47,639
Scott: I don't wear it sitting at my desk.

536
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,485
Scott: So it's charging.

537
00:34:48,605 --> 00:34:51,260
Scott: so it you know between you know, the morning and the afternoon.

538
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,134
Scott: It's like it doesn't really die, but the battery does not last long.

539
00:34:54,154 --> 00:34:57,251
Scott: if you heavily use it Like I'm sure it packs it's gonna die.

540
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:00,705
Scott: It's not gonna make it to the Micro USB, right?

541
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:02,132
Scott: It's mmm.

542
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:03,840
Scott: Yeah micro USB the same as the Kindle.

543
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:07,160
Rym: Could you just wear an energy around your neck and have it plugged in?

544
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,660
Scott: You thought you could put an energy in your pocket and have a cable going all the way up to the side of your head.

545
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:12,644
Scott: And yes, that would.

546
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:13,568
Scott: that will I will.

547
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:16,926
Rym: I think one of the first things I'll do when I get it is try to rig Something like that up.

548
00:35:16,946 --> 00:35:17,792
Rym: that isn't annoying.

549
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:24,280
Scott: if you just get a long Micro USB cable put the energy in your pocket and if the cables long enough now if I just know no that wouldn't work.

550
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,966
Rym: If you just did that what?

551
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:27,069
Rym: where is the?

552
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,227
Scott: the cable would be no more annoying than a headphone cable that goes to your pocket Your phone with your pocket.

553
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:33,100
Rym: would it stick out the bottom of glass or the side?

554
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,357
Rym: Let me look because if it sticks out the side There's no good because it would put it sticks out the bottom right here.

555
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:41,571
Scott: So basically it would be like having a one headphone cable.

556
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:43,700
Scott: Just go past your ear, right?

557
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:49,912
Rym: It's your pocket cuz a lot of people make the mistake of plugging USB cables into things where there will be.

558
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:55,311
Scott: Yeah, no go straight into the bottom.

559
00:35:55,371 --> 00:35:58,425
Scott: so it's all good in that respect Let's see.

560
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:00,320
Scott: What else is there to say about glass?

561
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,000
Scott: Oh, so some of the thing the apps that exists for it, right?

562
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,803
Scott: So you can do.

563
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:07,414
Scott: you can get Google now on it and the Google now.

564
00:36:07,514 --> 00:36:08,760
Scott: it works for me, right?

565
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,047
Scott: But the problem is that again It's using this other Google accounts.

566
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:17,245
Scott: the Google now doesn't have enough information about me to really do it Now is like the best, right?

567
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:23,978
Scott: Basically you would love it because you're basically your Google but your Google now is attached to your account.

568
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,792
Scott: Yeah But basically it's your Google now, so it does all that stuff.

569
00:36:27,872 --> 00:36:30,981
Scott: Mostly what the Google now does for me is weather.

570
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:33,249
Scott: it gives me the weather and it gives me.

571
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:40,560
Scott: it always tells me what restaurants are nearby so I can just be like Boop and there's the nearby restaurants with their ratings and I can just call them right.

572
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:47,949
Rym: I have a feeling if I have glass I'll use now a lot more because I only use now when I pull out my phone And think I'm gonna look at my phone.

573
00:36:48,149 --> 00:36:49,657
Scott: Google now is basically incredible.

574
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:50,300
Scott: the Google glass.

575
00:36:50,886 --> 00:36:57,040
Scott: I just don't have it really Using its full potential because it doesn't have enough data about me because it's using the wrong Gmail account.

576
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:05,680
Scott: The other real thing that people don't understand about Google glass Is that other than being a wristwatch pebble watch replacement in that you?

577
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:12,867
Scott: notifications come to your face and you don't take your phone out of your pocket and it's a you can see the time without taking Your phone in your pocket is?

578
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:15,480
Scott: it is also a Bluetooth headset on crack.

579
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,567
Rym: It's got that bone microphone.

580
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:27,527
Scott: Well, so the bone microphone is Interesting because it's kind of incredible how there's nothing in your ear, but you can hear this noise as it makes But it can really only do beeps and bloops.

581
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:30,275
Scott: It's really shitty at doing voice or music.

582
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,180
Scott: basically awful at doing voice or music.

583
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:33,353
Scott: I tried to make a phone call with it.

584
00:37:33,373 --> 00:37:36,263
Scott: It's like Right.

585
00:37:36,363 --> 00:37:39,235
Scott: I mean you could I could tell what they were saying, but no you use.

586
00:37:39,315 --> 00:37:42,560
Scott: don't use it for phone calls But it is a Bluetooth headset.

587
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:47,140
Scott: So someone calls you you see who's calling you in your eyeball, right?

588
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,240
Scott: You tab to pick up then you just talk because the mic has a microphone in it and it has the bone speaker, right?

589
00:37:54,342 --> 00:37:55,860
Scott: So there you go, right?

590
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,362
Scott: It's it's.

591
00:37:56,503 --> 00:37:59,059
Scott: it can even do video calls and and all kinds of you know.

592
00:37:59,522 --> 00:38:02,400
Scott: So you see that guy walking around with a Bluetooth headset?

593
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,219
Scott: You don't really see that guy anymore, but Google glass is that it's pretty much the best one there is on earth.

594
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:14,480
Rym: Oh So the other thing that you haven't pointed out because you have an iPhone you don't have access to everything.

595
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,420
Scott: Yeah, that's true, right?

596
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,618
Scott: So there are some things that Google glass does that I can't do because I have an iPhone.

597
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:22,228
Rym: for example Isn't it GPS and accelerometer data?

598
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,212
Scott: I don't know.

599
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:23,854
Scott: You might be able to.

600
00:38:23,975 --> 00:38:25,400
Scott: I don't know anything about accelerometer data.

601
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,694
Rym: That's what I read when I was reading the GPS.

602
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:28,600
Scott: in the menu.

603
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:32,517
Scott: It says like get directions and then whenever I choose that let me actually choose it right now.

604
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,540
Scott: Okay I Get direction, so I chose get directions.

605
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:40,308
Scott: Directions not available.

606
00:38:40,368 --> 00:38:43,060
Scott: connect to my glass for Android for GPS service.

607
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:49,870
Scott: So basically if an Android phone you run this my glass app on your Android phone right the Google Glass connects to it.

608
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:55,310
Scott: the Android phone does all the GPS work and Sends the data of what to tell you to the glass.

609
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:58,180
Scott: and the glass tells you, you know, turn left turn right?

610
00:38:58,241 --> 00:38:59,030
Scott: Whatever, so, I don't know.

611
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,940
Scott: I'm sure it works great.

612
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:03,252
Scott: I just can't use it because I have an iPhone and I don't have an Android phone.

613
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:05,632
Rym: doesn't the glass also have to tether via Wi-Fi?

614
00:39:06,253 --> 00:39:11,275
Scott: Okay so Google glass has Wi-Fi in it and it will always use Wi-Fi if it can find a Wi-Fi.

615
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:14,259
Scott: and the way you add Wi-Fi is to it is pretty clever.

616
00:39:14,723 --> 00:39:14,884
Rym: It'll

617
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:35,800
Scott: always try to use an open Wi-Fi if it can right But if it can't then what you do is you go to the my glass app and which works on mobile or the website basically right and you type in the Wi-Fi credentials and then it shows a QR code and you look at it and It sends the Wi-Fi credentials into the Google Glass via QR code and then the Google Glass will now try to connect to that Wi-Fi.

618
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,627
Scott: So it's on Wi-Fi right now in your house.

619
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,540
Scott: So it really it is a standalone device.

620
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:43,340
Scott: It gets its internet from Wi-Fi wherever you are.

621
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:53,118
Scott: But you really need to have a phone to go with it because otherwise the Bluetooth headset part of it is useless Obviously right for making calls and doing all that sort of stuff.

622
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:57,298
Scott: and B You want to tether it to your phone so that you can have data anywhere.

623
00:39:57,398 --> 00:40:01,093
Scott: Otherwise Having it only do its thing when there's Wi-Fi nearby.

624
00:40:01,113 --> 00:40:02,960
Scott: It's rarely gonna do its thing.

625
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,589
Scott: It'll basically be turned into a useless wristwatch.

626
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:08,800
Rym: if you want to try out the direction sometimes just borrow my Nexus 4.

627
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,290
Rym: I mean the GPS data works even without a data connection.

628
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:13,037
Scott: install the my glass app on there.

629
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:13,358
Rym: I will.

630
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,086
Scott: okay What else?

631
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:21,256
Scott: Oh you add contacts to it So you can add basically 10 contacts to speed dial and those are like you.

632
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:27,640
Scott: like if you called me I would see your face in the thingy because I added you is the one of the 10 speed dial people.

633
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,305
Scott: alright See what other things are on here.

634
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:34,536
Scott: There's an Evernote integration, which I haven't used because I don't know.

635
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:42,188
Scott: cuz I don't use Evernote There's a New York Times thing which supposedly will tell you like when you know, there's a news alert It'll be like, oh my god crazy news just happens.

636
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,012
Rym: Yeah, you know what I have.

637
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:43,756
Rym: that is called Twitter.

638
00:40:43,957 --> 00:40:47,008
Scott: Yeah Path I don't know what app that is.

639
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:47,731
Scott: I haven't used it.

640
00:40:47,852 --> 00:40:50,862
Scott: CNN similar to New York Times Facebook.

641
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:54,180
Scott: I have that enabled but all it really does is let you post to Facebook.

642
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,160
Scott: It doesn't actually give you anything from now.

643
00:40:56,521 --> 00:41:08,498
Rym: This is where really we have to write some apps because what I what with what this hardware actually is and what it does I want an app that will show me slides and speaking notes and help me control a speech.

644
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:09,682
Scott: I'm giving yeah You can do that.

645
00:41:09,823 --> 00:41:11,832
Scott: Yes with a Google Apps integration.

646
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:13,600
Scott: Definitely is capable of doing that.

647
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,209
Scott: Yeah, that is a hundred percent a thing.

648
00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:16,013
Scott: This can do.

649
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:16,939
Rym: that is thing.

650
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,943
Rym: one I wanted to do that - I wanted to do is GPS directions.

651
00:41:21,024 --> 00:41:25,100
Scott: while I'm biking thing what I want to do is show me the date in addition to the time.

652
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,366
Rym: I mean screen.

653
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:27,492
Scott: It just shows you the time.

654
00:41:27,512 --> 00:41:28,296
Scott: It doesn't show you the date.

655
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:29,040
Scott: It's like what the fuck?

656
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,602
Scott: I want to know what.

657
00:41:29,622 --> 00:41:34,379
Rym: today's when the batteries get better or if I do rig up something cool with an energy battery to keep It going all the time.

658
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:43,932
Rym: I would like to make an app because there's a ton of dashcam apps now for Android that do a really good job of Constantly recording like 10 minutes of video and cycling it.

659
00:41:44,193 --> 00:41:46,420
Rym: but then you can hit a button and it's like oh fuck and it records.

660
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:47,286
Rym: It keeps everything.

661
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:49,119
Rym: It's the someone attacked me.

662
00:41:49,422 --> 00:41:50,679
Rym: I want all the police data app.

663
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:55,288
Rym: I feel like you can make a really good app for glass But the battery would be the battery will tell you.

664
00:41:55,308 --> 00:42:03,193
Scott: people seem to think that like this glass it can like camera all the time Like you're videoing your life like the same way if you were wearing like a Buy a GoPro.

665
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:04,704
Scott: It's like yeah No, the camera will.

666
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:08,500
Scott: the battery will die in like 20 minutes if you keep the video running, right?

667
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,491
Scott: It is useless if you think you're gonna video your life with this thing.

668
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:14,000
Scott: Don't even begin to think that's a remote possibility.

669
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:17,620
Scott: There is forget it videoing for long periods of time.

670
00:42:18,022 --> 00:42:21,500
Scott: No cannot do now what you can make lines with it with an app.

671
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:27,380
Rym: You could do something clever where you have it wake up and automatically take a picture every five minutes.

672
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:31,049
Scott: Even that would basically have the battery life.

673
00:42:31,129 --> 00:42:31,711
Scott: Oh, yeah.

674
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:34,480
Rym: Oh, yeah, but if I'm gonna I'm gonna rig up my energy thing.

675
00:42:34,741 --> 00:42:39,440
Rym: In fact, I'll rig up an energy thing and maybe I'll get someone else to kickstart a battery pack.

676
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,788
Scott: The only reason the Google Glass battery lasts as long as it does is because it always Errors on the side of turning off right.

677
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:48,800
Scott: their philosophy at Google is, you know, don't turn it on.

678
00:42:49,183 --> 00:42:51,080
Scott: It should be sort of like an enhancement.

679
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,524
Scott: It should never bother you right?

680
00:42:52,905 --> 00:43:03,040
Scott: even if you have the Gmail enabled which I don't because it's again not using Google Google apps It will actually only tell you if you've got mail if Gmail considers it an important email.

681
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,500
Scott: So you have to really pay attention to that and you know that feature in Gmail with the important and not important emails.

682
00:43:08,223 --> 00:43:11,476
Scott: You really have to train your Gmail saying this message is important.

683
00:43:11,496 --> 00:43:12,058
Scott: This one's not.

684
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:12,600
Scott: this one's important.

685
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,169
Scott: this one's not so that it gets it right and will.

686
00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:18,967
Scott: only Google Glass will only wake up and tell you if it was an Important email.

687
00:43:19,008 --> 00:43:26,480
Scott: it'll show you what it was and When it shows you something it turns off right away Like when I turn it on to see the clock it turns off and like a couple seconds.

688
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:28,267
Scott: This thing just really loves to.

689
00:43:28,307 --> 00:43:34,030
Scott: it doesn't turn off fully obviously, but it loves to go to sleep Like imagine if you turn right just like me then.

690
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,419
Scott: Yeah, it just like it's like on off off off.

691
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:39,110
Scott: It just doesn't want to stay on.

692
00:43:39,331 --> 00:43:40,960
Rym: well remember what have we been saying?

693
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:49,007
Rym: For since 2005 when we started doing GeekNights publicly the biggest thing holding back all the cool things We want to do is technology.

694
00:43:49,048 --> 00:43:51,000
Rym: battery is consumer battery technology?

695
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:56,734
Rym: yep, and That stuff really has not progressed much in recent times because it can't.

696
00:43:56,874 --> 00:44:02,173
Scott: if it progresses then we make tiny grenades And it would also be really heavy on the side of your head right.

697
00:44:02,213 --> 00:44:03,860
Scott: the Google Glass is actually quite comfortable.

698
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,340
Scott: I'm definitely used to it by now.

699
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,480
Rym: We need local wireless power distribution coupled with you like in the smaller your back.

700
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:15,369
Rym: You just carry a fucking battery Whatever it's gonna be.

701
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:19,300
Scott: yeah, you go for it All right, I feel like we can.

702
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:21,740
Scott: I'm trying to think of like other things.

703
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:26,800
Rym: We're gonna talk about it probably off and on and our Monday shows for a while now because Scott's gonna keep using it.

704
00:44:27,241 --> 00:44:28,525
Rym: I've been playing with the API's.

705
00:44:28,605 --> 00:44:30,572
Rym: I'm actually once I have glass.

706
00:44:30,812 --> 00:44:33,019
Rym: I'm gonna write some fucking apps faster than you can blink.

707
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:45,540
Rym: Really good examples, it's really easy to write stuff mmm Let's see and I'm not gonna write anything that requires a lot of complex software design.

708
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,100
Rym: I'm writing things that are like show me the slides.

709
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:50,743
Scott: Yeah Turn to these.

710
00:44:50,803 --> 00:44:54,916
Scott: anything else I can say about it is it worth the monies?

711
00:44:55,177 --> 00:45:00,518
Rym: well, maybe You know what it's where it'll be worth the money for me.

712
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:15,354
Rym: Maybe Scott if you write an app or two, and it doesn't cost $300 a month from now If it costs like $800 a month from now or There's something that makes the Explorer Edition different like I what I could see.

713
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:23,277
Rym: I'm guessing here totally shooting from the hip That they'll have consumer glass and Explorer glass with different update patterns or different things.

714
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:25,064
Scott: who knows it's possible Whatever it.

715
00:45:25,245 --> 00:45:27,116
Scott: just it would be nice if they did something.

716
00:45:27,136 --> 00:45:27,840
Scott: you know.

717
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,048
Scott: I mean there are some other benefits of the Explorer.

718
00:45:30,088 --> 00:45:37,572
Scott: like I got an email that was like private party at the Explorer place in New York City the place you picked up your Google Glass on The same day as packs.

719
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:42,240
Scott: great guys Thanks come on over and hang out with the other glass explorers.

720
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:47,034
Rym: Can't figure out the high correlation rate between people who care about glass and people who care about packs.

721
00:45:47,275 --> 00:45:54,060
Rym: Yeah, New York Yeah, all right, I kind of want to go hang out with the studio audience for a bit.

722
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,836
Rym: So I think we're done here for now.

723
00:45:56,138 --> 00:46:04,640
Rym: yeah Also, I don't want to do too much more audio because now that I'm recording raw audio I've been fucking with the levels the whole time because this was you know on the fly.

724
00:46:05,342 --> 00:46:07,308
Rym: I gotta master this goddamn thing tonight now.

725
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:10,880
Scott: Yep, so we're not gonna talk more about glass now, but maybe more later.

726
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:18,475
Rym: we'll talk about it when we've written some apps or I get it or as Scott discovers things about it mm-hmm, and you're gonna see a lot of pictures of me.

727
00:46:18,515 --> 00:46:28,480
Rym: probably maybe This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

728
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:33,383
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

729
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:35,550
Scott: be sure to visit our website at front row.

730
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:38,600
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

731
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:46,279
