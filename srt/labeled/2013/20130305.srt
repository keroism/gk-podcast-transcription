00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,353
Rym: It's Tuesday March 5th 2013.

2
00:00:12,353 --> 00:00:15,102
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:17,229
Rym: Why you can't find a gaming group.

4
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:21,218
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,787 --> 00:00:24,490
Rym: Was that short enough?

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,889
Scott: That was the exact right length.

7
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:30,122
Rym: So you realize Scott I could have.

8
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:31,868
Rym: this could have been a trap for all.

9
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:33,518
Rym: you know I actually did.

10
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:42,342
Rym: I'm gonna after you go home Edit a really long intro and it'll sound like you were sent into that intro and because you don't listen to GeekNights You would not know.

11
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:45,450
Scott: So I can buy the thing you are saying right now.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,644
Scott: You will probably will not edit out because it's the only opening bit you have.

13
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,010
Rym: actually I do have an opening bit.

14
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:57,130
Rym: So our good friends Phil and J We're back from their adventures around the world and Phil is a ski patrol dude wasn't an adventure around the world.

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:03,294
Rym: It is an adventure on the other side of the world around the world in the colloquial sense that you're going around to different Places in the world.

16
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:04,077
Scott: two places.

17
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:04,739
Rym: Yeah.

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,951
Rym: Well on a macro scale two places If it's not friggin Day.

19
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:16,960
Rym: I went to Crescent Street, I went to cream Queensborough Plaza twice.

20
00:01:17,522 --> 00:01:19,810
Rym: I went to the second and third levels of Queensborough Plaza.

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,322
Scott: Is that around the world?

22
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:24,254
Scott: Yeah, they're Around the world.

23
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:28,347
Rym: is Magellan Rym not Magellan around the world is a song in initial D.

24
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:29,230
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

25
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,071
Scott: Hey ready?

26
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:30,452
Scott: Watch this.

27
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:34,560
Rym: See you didn't actually move.

28
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:38,550
Rym: You're in the same location.

29
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,017
Rym: your vector is hardly moved.

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,185
Scott: I Just gone around the world.

31
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:47,779
Scott: if you consider if we move the North Pole or something to right here because it's in an arbitrary spot It's a globe, right?

32
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:57,582
Rym: I mean in fact Scott if I were if someone were to say around the world in the sense that you're describing what they should Say and would say is Circumnavigate the world.

33
00:01:57,602 --> 00:01:57,823
Rym: Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:58,103 --> 00:01:59,205
Rym: That is not what I say.

35
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:13,524
Rym: circumnavigate is a synonym of go around anyway, so The cool part of this is that we went skiing and I for the first time in years got to ski with someone who's Not a similar level of ability.

36
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:16,111
Scott: So far greater level of ability.

37
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:17,815
Rym: Well skill is skill.

38
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:22,204
Rym: So I'm a pretty confident Competent semi-expert skier.

39
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:27,760
Rym: Phil does ski patrol is kind of badass at skiing, but he hadn't skied in like two and a half years.

40
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:29,930
Scott: Oh, I thought he had skied often.

41
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,920
Rym: He did until about two years ago.

42
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:40,790
Rym: So we go skiing and the one thing I can say is that it took him all of Ten seconds to get all his skill back and two.

43
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,876
Rym: he doesn't ski with poles, which is interesting in three.

44
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:47,828
Rym: He skis Way Faster than I ski like.

45
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:50,100
Rym: I consider myself pretty fast and reckless.

46
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,079
Rym: I kind of just go for it and I led around the first several runs because I know the mountain and he doesn't.

47
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:59,217
Rym: then I was Like all right you lead now, you know your way around and yeah, we just go down this.

48
00:02:59,377 --> 00:02:59,920
Rym: he's just gone.

49
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,067
Rym: I'm like struggling to keep up.

50
00:03:02,147 --> 00:03:03,451
Rym: I'm pushing myself in ways.

51
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:04,414
Rym: I've never pushed myself.

52
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,458
Scott: You don't really have to push.

53
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:06,140
Scott: It's gravity.

54
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,770
Rym: Uh, so it's not just gravity.

55
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,300
Rym: For example, if you there's the fall line, right?

56
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,645
Rym: So per say you say there's the mountain.

57
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:13,865
Rym: right.

58
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:19,140
Rym: the straightest down line per gravity on a slope is the fall line.

59
00:03:19,962 --> 00:03:26,767
Rym: If you just don't edge at all your skis just naturally point that way and you accelerate at About the fastest.

60
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:28,916
Rym: you could possibly accelerate unless you were dropped.

61
00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:36,320
Rym: Mm-hmm But one you can't actually go that way or you'll go too fast and there'll be things in your way trees.

62
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:40,171
Rym: So instead you will go kind of crosswise the fall line.

63
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:43,300
Rym: You're swooshing back and forth across the fall line.

64
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:53,651
Rym: He took a much tighter and more aggressive Course and I was thus forced to ski similarly aggressively Thus putting myself into compromising in difficult situations.

65
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:54,093
Rym: Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:56,200
Rym: It was great fun though, but I worked some muscle.

67
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,963
Rym: I've never worked before.

68
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:58,248
Scott: I don't know how you goes.

69
00:03:58,308 --> 00:03:59,010
Scott: no sticks though.

70
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,560
Scott: Even the pros and the Olympics use sticks, right?

71
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,180
Rym: Well, yeah, but you don't need them actually Alright, then why are they there?

72
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,164
Rym: For a lot of things.

73
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,631
Rym: they're useful if you need them to pick turns Which if you're really good skier, you can do that without.

74
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:18,077
Rym: the pole doesn't actually make you turn It's the motion of planting it that kind of gets you to move the right way.

75
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:23,260
Rym: to make the turn - they're useful to kind of like push yourself off the lift, but you can just muscle through with your legs.

76
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:27,833
Rym: They're useful to pop your bindings off But if you're strong, you can just reach down and pop them off on your own.

77
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:30,283
Rym: so they're useful But they're not necessary.

78
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:35,200
Rym: In fact good modern ski schools don't give kids ski poles for their first several lessons.

79
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,020
Scott: Well, I've seen yeah, I've seen people not use poles in their learning.

80
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,058
Scott: But I mean every Olympic slalom II person has sticks all the time.

81
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:45,993
Rym: Yeah So but if you're just skiing around on your own, you're not in a competition.

82
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:47,680
Rym: The poles are not necessary.

83
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,405
Scott: Also cross-country.

84
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:50,449
Scott: You definitely need the sticks, right?

85
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:51,674
Scott: Because then you are pushing yourself.

86
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:54,410
Rym: Yeah, we use different special skis Super long sticks - right?

87
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:54,612
Scott: Yeah.

88
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:55,076
Rym: Yeah.

89
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:02,730
Rym: But anyway, if anyone wants to go skiing at Killington or Hunter in the next couple weekends I think I'm gonna run out the rest of the season soon before PAX.

90
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:06,262
Rym: I don't think there'll be much skiing after PAX Probably not.

91
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:07,506
Scott: It's gonna be a bunch of biking.

92
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:10,414
Rym: Yeah, I almost bike to work this morning.

93
00:05:11,197 --> 00:05:13,123
Scott: No, it's warm enough It's too cold.

94
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:13,746
Rym: I dude.

95
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,071
Rym: I don't even need a jacket anymore.

96
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:17,260
Rym: The only reason I didn't bike is that I woke up late.

97
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:18,047
Scott: I'm still wearing a hat.

98
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:21,960
Rym: So Saturday is gonna be like 48 degrees too cold and sunny.

99
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:25,337
Rym: So I'm gonna get the bike out and get it ready and I'm gonna try to bike to work next week.

100
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:27,665
Rym: too cold Unless I go to Colombia too cold.

101
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:29,671
Rym: So you got any news Catherine?

102
00:05:30,353 --> 00:05:31,557
Scott: I do have a news.

103
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:37,525
Scott: one of the two games I play and as to I like how we don't talk at all about the PlayStation 4.

104
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:38,135
Scott: Who gives a shit?

105
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,500
Scott: Anyway, I mean what it's okay.

106
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:48,919
Scott: So a more powerful machine that has a different slightly different controller that will play not based on cell appears to be x86.

107
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:53,400
Scott: We'll have the next Gran Turismo game and the next Metal Gear game.

108
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:54,267
Scott: Okay.

109
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:55,235
Scott: No next.

110
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:59,361
Scott: Yeah Anyway, the next look a little big planet game will also be on there I don't know.

111
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:04,300
Scott: and the same all the cross-platform games that are also an Xbox will be on it as well.

112
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:04,801
Rym: I'm just.

113
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:07,973
Rym: I don't see any reason for there be different kinds of consoles anymore.

114
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:08,635
Scott: consoles.

115
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:09,920
Scott: There are going out anyway.

116
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,659
Rym: I don't think you're going out.

117
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,986
Rym: I think there's no need for different consoles.

118
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:19,222
Rym: the idea of a console that somehow has exclusives from another console just seems Ridiculous.

119
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:19,644
Scott: Yep.

120
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:22,171
Scott: Anyway, so one of two games.

121
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:25,440
Scott: I play natural selection - it, you know, they're updating it quite often.

122
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,929
Scott: They just had a big update.

123
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:30,798
Scott: The update was known as the gorgeous update.

124
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:37,649
Rym: gorgeous I was I I wasn't paying attention because I play NS2 off and on but really Counter-strike has been my current wheelhouse.

125
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,680
Scott: That's also a fine game anyway.

126
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,869
Scott: So in the gorgeous update, they added many things.

127
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,494
Scott: they added railgun exos.

128
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:47,837
Scott: Oh, man, they added What else?

129
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:50,415
Scott: Trying to remember anything.

130
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:53,041
Scott: they added Oh they added the gorge Assholes.

131
00:06:53,062 --> 00:07:00,245
Scott: a gorge can now basically put an asshole on the ground and then put an asshole somewhere else and then the aliens and Marines Can go through the asshole.

132
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:02,534
Scott: It's like a. it's a busy a wormhole from one place to.

133
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:03,738
Rym: people are calling them assholes.

134
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,659
Scott: in the game It looks like a giant butthole.

135
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,819
Scott: There's a little bit of lag when you go in and out of them and Marines get hurt if they're in them.

136
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:13,832
Scott: Also, if it somehow gets destroyed you buy Marines shooting at it.

137
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:16,120
Scott: while people are inside they all die.

138
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:21,747
Rym: Those are that's the kind of thing that in the original NS1 I would like have fantasies about.

139
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:26,753
Scott: so like a bunch of Exos are in there and then it gets closed and they're all just dead.

140
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:28,740
Rym: Yeah cowboy bebop style be epic.

141
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:38,205
Rym: But anyway, the most important thing the thing you were obviously waiting to say something about holding off to last just now the return of The babbler.

142
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:40,600
Rym: that is my first memory of the handlers.

143
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:46,997
Scott: They're kind of not the most useful But you can do it ever were in old NS babbler served two purposes.

144
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:51,912
Rym: one You could get them stuck in yourself and then they would kill you or two.

145
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:54,279
Rym: You could accidentally kill your own hive with them.

146
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:01,720
Scott: Anyway now they work but they're you know, basically the best thing you can do with babblers now is number one.

147
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,151
Scott: You can you know, you command them sort of the same way.

148
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:06,179
Scott: you command the antlions and half-life, too.

149
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,572
Scott: All right, only they're a little smaller and weaker.

150
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:10,120
Rym: They have a few more things they can do.

151
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:12,720
Scott: You can make them stick to yourself as armor.

152
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:16,520
Scott: You can make them stick to a friendly alien as extra armor, which is nice.

153
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:21,740
Scott: But the biggest thing you can do is you can have them sort of go out there and they don't do much damage.

154
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:26,800
Scott: But they distract the Marines by basically filling their shit with all sorts of crazy babblers everywhere.

155
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:30,420
Scott: So the Marines will often especially noobs will shoot at the babbler.

156
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,755
Rym: I've already seen videos of gorge rushes that don't win the game.

157
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:42,673
Scott: It's just people being dumb But it's a gorge rush and it's just all babblers and the Marines will shoot at the babblers and then not shoot at the gorges And then yeah, they're in big trouble.

158
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:49,130
Rym: Ah See, it's fun cuz in old remember I mean the early days of NS when it was, you know NS one.

159
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:57,879
Rym: the matches would last like an hour plus Always and they were so slow and there was such a long game.

160
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,268
Scott: There was the one top period where they had.

161
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:03,840
Scott: the version of NS was such that the skulk rush could not be beaten.

162
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:10,938
Rym: So every game was just an invincible skull crush Yep, or if they pulled out the skiff you've survived the skull crush, then it was an hour and 45 minutes.

163
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:14,678
Scott: Second skull crush that was guaranteed to work.

164
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:17,037
Rym: Well that was when the skulks were the p90.

165
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:24,300
Rym: Yeah But the way during the era of the long game when babblers were still around too and also towers of lame.

166
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:28,299
Rym: Yeah, I would build like 40 OCs block it.

167
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:32,104
Rym: I I Don't want it.

168
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:49,520
Rym: It wasn't a good game when it was like that But I really enjoyed it for some reason like that that type of gameplay of the super long game Where I could just kind of buy myself as a gorge just fucking make an invincible asshole wall of death and just be a jerk Like I'd build one of those right side outside of the marine base.

169
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,700
Rym: They wouldn't notice till it was too late.

170
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,709
Rym: But my favorite thing in that game is the harass.

171
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:59,692
Rym: I would sit in the vent just spraying gas as a lurk Into their spawn for an hour.

172
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:03,388
Rym: I'd never get tired of that or Babblers for an hour.

173
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:04,819
Scott: I mean you can still do that now.

174
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:14,039
Scott: You can stay as a lurk and just sort of shoot at people from really far away like a pussy Yep And it is kind of fun because you're doing some small amount of damage and you're not really getting hurt.

175
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:21,140
Scott: But there's a big opportunity cause it's basically you're fucking over your team because you spent all these team resources and an entire player.

176
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,725
Scott: I'm basically doing nothing Just bullshitting.

177
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:28,963
Rym: to be fair in the old game at what that kind of harassment was much more effective And it's new.

178
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:35,688
Scott: Yeah, you could if you're a lurk gassing from a vent into marine base in the old NS Yeah that you could hurt him pretty bad with that.

179
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:40,659
Rym: But with babblers I can play my gorge harass Which I have not been able to play in years.

180
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:45,150
Scott: You can't really gorge harass at the current babblers right now.

181
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:45,893
Scott: They're not strong.

182
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:46,395
Scott: They're really weak.

183
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:52,695
Scott: Really if you're a gorge you have to be the battle gorge and just bile bomb.

184
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:55,448
Scott: Bile bomb is still so powerful If I've got bile bomb.

185
00:10:55,548 --> 00:10:57,199
Scott: It's all about sneaky bile bomb.

186
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:01,098
Rym: anyway If you're not playing NS you really should be.

187
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:12,180
Rym: Seriously, if you're playing counter-strike it's okay, but I think as much as I like counter-strike I'm thinking about going 50/50 with the NS as opposed to my current 80/20.

188
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,860
Rym: So a kickstarter recently launched and I saw it like right away just randomly.

189
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:18,343
Rym: I didn't.

190
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:20,074
Rym: I didn't have any announcements set up.

191
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:21,040
Rym: I didn't have any notifications.

192
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:36,320
Rym: I just randomly went to kickstarter like I should kickstart a bunch of shit and I saw kobolds ate my baby All hail King Torg and that brought back Memories, in fact, it's against one of those games that we've talked about in many of our panels and lectures.

193
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:41,376
Rym: We haven't talked about it in a while Yeah, like in our old beyond Dungeons & Dragons like in the early days.

194
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:42,300
Rym: We'd mentioned this game.

195
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,460
Rym: Yeah, and it's one of those toy RPGs.

196
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:51,353
Rym: It was you know, it's the old Was basically use D&D rules like second-ed.

197
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,420
Scott: not even it's way simpler than that.

198
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:57,000
Rym: No, no use those rules, but you're a kobold.

199
00:11:57,201 --> 00:12:02,460
Rym: You basically don't have any skills or any way simpler than D&D rules.

200
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,187
Scott: It's not even close to first your stats or single-digit.

201
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:13,299
Rym: the options you have available to you're basically nothing and it's really a board game In that you're just trying to steal babies and take them back to be eaten.

202
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:23,140
Scott: Well, yes But in at the same time it's sort of a role-playing game as if you're a kobold trying to steal babies and you enter these Situations with like some chickens or dogs or some people trying to swing brooms at you.

203
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,029
Scott: And then what do you do?

204
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:25,120
Rym: it fits this?

205
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,559
Rym: You can't play this game a hundred percent by the book like you would old D&D because then it's not fun at all.

206
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:35,415
Rym: But if you play this the same way you would run a convention one-off paranoia game.

207
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:37,000
Rym: It is great fun.

208
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:39,547
Rym: So this game is largely forgotten.

209
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:40,490
Rym: people didn't really know about it.

210
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,300
Scott: Not a no and it's just sort of you know, it's forgotten.

211
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:45,086
Rym: Only people like us know about this.

212
00:12:45,106 --> 00:12:49,120
Rym: a lot of people know about not enough people, but well, I guess yeah enough people.

213
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,420
Rym: So basically it got Kickstarter to be re-released with a bunch of stuff and I saw it right away.

214
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:02,591
Rym: I was like one of the first three or four people to kickstart it and Within a day they hit their $11,000 goal and it's already done 28 days to go.

215
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:07,568
Scott: Told you the only problem nobody.

216
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:08,612
Rym: I don't this.

217
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:18,372
Rym: don't have that many people in the grand scheme of things Especially because a lot of people for an RPG that's not D&D dude They got ten backers at which is the max at a hundred bucks.

218
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:19,034
Rym: Yeah.

219
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:21,041
Rym: Yeah, seven is 75.

220
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,168
Scott: What do you get for a hundred bucks?

221
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:22,672
Rym: Let's see.

222
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:23,819
Rym: What do you get at a hundred bucks you get?

223
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:25,600
Rym: It's the Kovalik stalker.

224
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:33,025
Rym: You get everything in the endless buffet package plus the art pack and John Kovalik will sign and personalize your book with the special Cobalt drawing.

225
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:40,875
Rym: I don't really need the special cobalt drawing Kickstarter for just the book and the random horrible death table.

226
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:42,600
Scott: What's the random horrible death table?

227
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,232
Rym: Look up a random horrible death.

228
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:46,786
Scott: All right Kickstarter exclusive.

229
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:47,550
Scott: so it's not a table.

230
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,679
Scott: You can play the game on its table to look up.

231
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:52,436
Rym: I don't think I want to own a random horrible death table.

232
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:52,999
Rym: Why not?

233
00:13:54,362 --> 00:14:01,034
Scott: Kidding me if you're looking through the dick IKEA catalog horrible death table you want to make that is the best-selling table.

234
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:07,080
Rym: make an absurd and Surprisingly specific lookup table for RPGs for something really archaic.

235
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:13,551
Scott: We should make a book that a Creative Commons book to go with the name book the absurd lookup table book We could make that.

236
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:14,679
Rym: we could make that as a group.

237
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:21,238
Scott: I'll add random horrible deaths funny items stabs of power stabs of not so much power.

238
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:36,225
Scott: Yeah random dispositions of corpses yeah, you know locations dispositions of zombies Towns Anyway names of planets planes of existence.

239
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:43,837
Rym: I Resolved to tell everyone about this Kickstarter, but since it's already backed whatevs if you back it you back it.

240
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:44,459
Rym: if you don't you don't.

241
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,689
Rym: but Cobalt saved my baby.

242
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:52,781
Rym: if you've never played it Find one of the old-timers in your group and by old-timers, I mean people over the age of 24.

243
00:14:52,781 --> 00:15:00,799
Scott: Let me tell you let me tell like this, right We didn't play test this at all is to board games as couples ate my baby is to role-playing games.

244
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:11,017
Rym: That is a very good way to put it, but anyway things of the day.

245
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:12,363
Rym: What do you got?

246
00:15:12,664 --> 00:15:17,780
Scott: so me this I saw this video, and it sort of felt like something I had seen before.

247
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:28,296
Scott: But I looked at the YouTube date, and it said oh I clicked away from the date the day Uploaded on February 28th 2013. so I guess I hadn't seen it before.

248
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:29,520
Rym: it might be a re-upload.

249
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:36,720
Scott: No, because it's a video of some sort of you know talent TV show in Japan of some sorts right yeah.

250
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:49,815
Scott: And this guy has this really sort of artistic performance he does where he balances a whole bunch of things and there's a feather at the end and It's uh it's 12 minutes long, but it's pretty gripping.

251
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,039
Scott: you should watch this.

252
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:59,277
Scott: It's you know it's one of those things like oh snap that guy How long did he practice and prepare all the stuff to make that happen?

253
00:15:59,398 --> 00:15:59,980
Scott: and it worked?

254
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:07,259
Scott: He did it on stage one chance to get it right and carrots, and he did it right and it's like oh snap That's pretty amazing right there.

255
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,814
Rym: So all I got is way back.

256
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:23,520
Rym: well not that way back We did our book club book of the Greg Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald and our friend Judith showed us a while ago And I've been saving until after the book club Someone made a sort of retro straight-up NES game.

257
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:25,740
Rym: That is the Great Gatsby.

258
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:33,961
Rym: And it is done in the style of how movie and book properties were translated into NES games in the era when that Happened.

259
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:34,885
Rym: so well it

260
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:38,075
Scott: reminds me of Barbie the NES game only not as bad yep,

261
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:49,620
Rym: or uh toys Mmm, but toys was on the SNES, but same thing It's just there's a certain style of NES game that is based on some other property where they're generic

262
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,571
Scott: Platformer where you collect stuff and then in between levels they get

263
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:56,098
Rym: cut scenes that may or may not actually match and

264
00:16:56,178 --> 00:17:01,720
Scott: all the items You collect bad guys and backgrounds are related to the intellectual property that which is licensed.

265
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:04,913
Rym: But if you've read the Great Gatsby, it's actually kind of funny to play through this game.

266
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:08,960
Rym: Yeah, Oh spoilers I guess if you haven't read the Great Gatsby sure whatever.

267
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:11,740
Scott: All right this time for the meta.

268
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:18,964
Scott: so the book club book is the player of games By Ian M. Banks.

269
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,335
Scott: it is the most GeekNights book a book can be.

270
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:28,937
Scott: you need to read it Especially if you're a player of games that you probably are if you're reading listening this episode in a few weekends.

271
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,265
Rym: the penny arcade Expo East is happening.

272
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:32,288
Scott: Oh shit.

273
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:36,965
Rym: We're gonna be there Scott, and I and Emily are all Enforcing.

274
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:38,051
Rym: we have taken up the black.

275
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:39,257
Rym: it is a hundred percent official.

276
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:39,739
Scott: It's the red.

277
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:43,160
Rym: Well now they still say take up the black because it's blue.

278
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:47,523
Rym: Yeah, it's blue on one side and red on the other side, but the badge is black It's red.

279
00:17:47,663 --> 00:17:52,180
Rym: that was the rationale that an enforcer explained to me when I said the same thing that you just said to me.

280
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:55,113
Scott: They just want to keep saying black You know?

281
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:57,809
Rym: yeah Well look look at the history of video games.

282
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,370
Rym: if there is a garment in an MMO The black ones the most expensive one.

283
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:05,660
Scott: that was true in puzzle pirates that was true in the realm.

284
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:16,177
Rym: So we are going to be at the penny arcade expo East not just enforcing But we are presenting at least two lectures in the tabletop theater on Saturday March 23rd at noon.

285
00:18:17,904 --> 00:18:20,500
Rym: We are doing mastering game mechanics.

286
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:34,890
Rym: Oh shit We're talking about from the design side and the play side Core game mechanics how they work what they mean how to be good at them how to design them and then at 1 30 PM same room same day.

287
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:37,397
Rym: We're doing practical game theory so pretty much.

288
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,440
Scott: We have the room back-to-back.

289
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,600
Rym: Yeah, we talk a lot about game theory on GeekNights Saturday afternoon.

290
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:59,500
Rym: So basically we're gonna take all that game theory and explain the important parts without the math Because actually the important parts are more important than the math parts to people who play games as we say often But never actually dwell on much more than saying that and then showing math or something stupid no one cares about.

291
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:02,740
Rym: So we're going straight into the practical side of game theory.

292
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:05,705
Rym: ConnectiCon symmetry panels.

293
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:08,235
Rym: we're currently scheduling so the longer you wait the less likely it is.

294
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:09,159
Rym: I'll give you a good slot.

295
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:11,919
Rym: Yeah, Scott's got a grand prix going on.

296
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:12,620
Scott: Oh, yeah.

297
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,105
Scott: So there is a grand prix.

298
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:14,808
Scott: that is happening.

299
00:19:14,848 --> 00:19:22,820
Scott: if you want to prove that you are the best gaming listener of GeekNights You've got until Thursday at midnight Eastern Standard Time to submit your first round score.

300
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,808
Scott: Yes, cannibal is the first round.

301
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:26,093
Scott: you can submit your score.

302
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:27,720
Scott: all the instructions are in the forum.

303
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:31,179
Scott: There's two threads a main thread and then another thread just for round one.

304
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,268
Rym: She said there's only gonna be one like four rounds.

305
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:36,961
Scott: This is gonna be I don't know, you know, I can change it at will Right.

306
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:37,303
Scott: It's just.

307
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:40,072
Scott: I thought four rounds would be enough and now I'm reconsidering.

308
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:41,417
Scott: but it doesn't really matter right?

309
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:42,200
Scott: how many rounds are?

310
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,059
Scott: You don't need to know that now.

311
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:50,951
Scott: all you need to know is that register and do as well as you can in each round and Then you know victory will come right?

312
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:52,920
Scott: I mean, it's like I could change the scoring system, right?

313
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,780
Scott: It's like we're keeping we know who had the original scores, right?

314
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,164
Scott: So we can we can change it up to fit to figure out what is the best and the most fair and in fact It's sort of good that it's.

315
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:09,623
Scott: you know, it's I know it's sort of annoying and I'm professional that it's so fluid and changing But at the same time it's not first one It's the first one.

316
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:19,380
Scott: and also by changing it and try and experimenting with different, you know methods of you know Running this thing we can really hone it in and perfect it and come up with something really great.

317
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,558
Scott: So it's like the open source under development grand prix.

318
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:28,340
Scott: And even though it's sort of like well you're participating in the sort of beta test one.

319
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:34,260
Scott: You someone still wins legit and there's gonna be a legit real prize forever wins.

320
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,149
Rym: So yeah, we'll see if I can compete.

321
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:38,280
Rym: it might be next week that I go to Columbia.

322
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:39,905
Scott: Yeah I mean the only reason I don't.

323
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:45,579
Scott: I thought of only doing four rounds cuz I was like well if it goes more rounds than That this thing's gonna take for fucking like half the year, right?

324
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,420
Scott: It's like how long do we want it to be ongoing forever, right?

325
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,874
Scott: And it's like to make it accessible to all the different people, you know And who don't have money or live in a different country.

326
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,140
Rym: see what your other game picks are.

327
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,132
Rym: But I did I have a gut feeling but again, I'm letting you run.

328
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:00,714
Rym: It's all you.

329
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:01,377
Rym: I'm just.

330
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:02,240
Rym: I'm just a competitor.

331
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:02,821
Rym: I got nothing.

332
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:04,624
Rym: Scott doesn't even tell me what the games are.

333
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:13,270
Rym: No, but I think I would back off like 5% on the accessibility just to open up the scope of games available that might be necessary.

334
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:20,713
Scott: That's what I would do, you know, and in fact since we're experimenting, you know It's some rounds might be more accessible than others, right?

335
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:26,575
Scott: Especially since it's hard to find a game That's so accessible like like cannonball was like the most perfect game in terms of.

336
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:27,860
Scott: you can play it and almost anything.

337
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,151
Scott: And it's so cheap Yeah And it's so direct and it's just score who's the best.

338
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:34,953
Scott: and it's also kind of good even though Rym doesn't like it cuz he sucks at it.

339
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:37,086
Rym: I'm not good at it.

340
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:41,183
Rym: I'm not gonna pretend I am but I don't like it Because you suck at it.

341
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:42,386
Rym: not to review the game.

342
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:54,216
Rym: But as a kind of an aside, I never liked one-button platformers because Usually I have seen everything the game has to offer Within a few minutes of playing and any close to kaboom.

343
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:56,626
Rym: if you think about it It is and you know what?

344
00:21:56,886 --> 00:22:00,399
Scott: I would have almost no if you turn it or if you rotate it 90 degrees.

345
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,204
Scott: No, you can think of it.

346
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:08,380
Rym: almost no boom because kaboom has two directions and a bun.

347
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:14,155
Rym: It's kaboom with gravity to the right And could lateral control as opposed to a one button.

348
00:22:14,196 --> 00:22:15,140
Scott: platformer, right?

349
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:24,926
Scott: I mean you could control kaboom with one button if you figure that the The buckets stay to the right all the time and holding down the button moves them to the left and letting go of the button Moves them back to the right.

350
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:26,698
Scott: only the difference in cannonball is that?

351
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,206
Scott: Go back to the right.

352
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:34,626
Rym: that's a ridiculous argument because they're fundamental analogous mechanics are different.

353
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:41,264
Rym: if you make that argument and I'm gonna tell you that Megaman 3 and Metroid are the same because they have the same basic controls I'm saying that.

354
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:43,440
Scott: I'm not saying they're exactly the same same genre.

355
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:51,339
Scott: There is a. there is one key difference between them And that is the only is that is rotated 90 degrees and that there is gravity to one side.

356
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:56,577
Rym: No, it's not just that because that's a pattern in two dimensions.

357
00:22:56,637 --> 00:23:02,426
Rym: now one Also, it's not procedurally generated That's true.

358
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:03,920
Scott: kaboom is is stored, right?

359
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,920
Scott: It's the same exact thing.

360
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:08,892
Rym: Boom has three lives and the option of getting more lives.

361
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:11,680
Rym: kaboom has a final score in a victory condition.

362
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:13,639
Rym: There's lots of differences.

363
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,789
Rym: I just get really bored playing games like this.

364
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,419
Rym: super hexagon is pretty much as low as you can take me down.

365
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,324
Rym: the Minimalist mechanic.

366
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:25,853
Rym: generate flow game genre possible before I get bored.

367
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:27,036
Rym: I love super hexagon.

368
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:29,523
Rym: one step more minimalist I don't give a shit.

369
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:37,272
Scott: Well round two is gonna be not even anywhere close to cannonball, but Okey-dokey, perhaps he's gonna be a masturbatory contest.

370
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:39,320
Scott: It is even more accessible.

371
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:40,783
Rym: Perhaps masturbation?

372
00:23:40,884 --> 00:23:45,877
Scott: perhaps it might be the most accessible game of mostly skill that I could find.

373
00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:47,240
Rym: singing or masturbation?

374
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:48,586
Scott: No, really?

375
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:49,189
Rym: Cuz you can.

376
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:50,474
Scott: neither of those are games of skill.

377
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:53,898
Rym: I Would argue that the latter is a game of skill.

378
00:23:55,121 --> 00:23:57,109
Rym: Anyway, I mean is it gonna be hit a target?

379
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:59,278
Rym: Is it gonna be quickest?

380
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:02,598
Rym: No So we've talked about a lot of topics similar to this.

381
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:04,959
Scott: off I feel like we've done this before.

382
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:08,895
Rym: Nightpiece Boonie, you could have said something before we started the episode.

383
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,926
Rym: if you had doubts captain I did say something.

384
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:12,589
Scott: you didn't you never see.

385
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:15,540
Scott: you didn't say that but I didn't actually search to find out.

386
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:20,500
Rym: But I don't want to talk about the things we've talked about tangentially related this before.

387
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:23,151
Rym: I don't want to tell you how to find a gaming.

388
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,939
Scott: No, we've definitely discussed that.

389
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,336
Rym: Yeah That's not we're talking about here because this is a separate problem.

390
00:24:28,356 --> 00:24:29,140
Rym: That's similar.

391
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,366
Rym: It's in the same wheelhouse.

392
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:33,239
Rym: My goal is a wheelhouse in every episode for the rest of the year.

393
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:39,596
Rym: But it's the problem of how come so many of you gamers out there.

394
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:42,891
Rym: I'm talking to you directly Have trouble finding a.

395
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:44,520
Scott: yeah, this is a meta question, right?

396
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:54,309
Scott: Cuz it's like something you see in every single online discussion podcast anything having to do with gaming Especially tables up RPGs, but also board games and others.

397
00:24:54,530 --> 00:25:01,931
Scott: never mind every convention has a panel or ten on it Is people can't find other people to game with.

398
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:14,127
Scott: now we could go over the same discussion again of how do you find people to game with but we're not gonna do that because that's been done in every forum and every message board and Every convention and every podcast and every game.

399
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:18,080
Rym: now never mind the fact that that universe usually actually wrong.

400
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:22,133
Scott: Many times the advice is wrong, but it's a discussion that's been had everywhere.

401
00:25:22,193 --> 00:25:24,360
Scott: But the real question is the meta, right?

402
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:28,660
Scott: Why is this discussion never-ending and why is it everywhere?

403
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,040
Scott: Why do people keep asking it over and over again?

404
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,148
Scott: And how come people don't solve it and how come?

405
00:25:33,168 --> 00:25:36,540
Rym: because meanwhile, for example, let's look at like anime fandom, right?

406
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:47,135
Rym: There was an era way back before digital fansubs before you know The internet was really accessible where if you were an anime fan you were alone in that fandom.

407
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:51,812
Scott: You had to ask not only Where can I get animates?

408
00:25:51,912 --> 00:25:52,677
Rym: How do I know?

409
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,260
Rym: more importantly?

410
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,189
Rym: how do I find someone to talk about anime with like?

411
00:25:56,209 --> 00:26:10,618
Rym: when I was in middle school and I met a dude at one point and he had an a Rama one-half t-shirt on and I was like, oh my god, you know what anime is.

412
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:13,314
Rym: and Here's the problem.

413
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:15,089
Scott: He didn't Know he did.

414
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:16,520
Rym: he totally knew what anime was.

415
00:26:17,922 --> 00:26:34,920
Rym: He had such a caustic poisonous nerdy personality That despite the fact that I wanted anyone other than my parents and my brother to talk about anime with I Chose to never engage with that person again.

416
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:45,860
Rym: And I think that happens to gamers a lot Because I heard an anecdote in the last week from someone who had a gaming group.

417
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:49,220
Rym: So, you know you have like gaming groups in your town in your school, whatever.

418
00:26:49,341 --> 00:27:10,340
Rym: But a lot of people like us if you're you know, it's one something out of college or in college You have your own private or semi-private gaming group Like you invite your friends over every week or every month to play games And the anecdote was that these people had someone where they basically cancelled the game night And then started again and quietly invited everyone except one person.

419
00:27:12,023 --> 00:27:16,159
Rym: I think a lot more gaming groups need to do that.

420
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,705
Scott: Yes But that is answer number.

421
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:25,281
Scott: one of reasons why this thread keeps showing up is because this guy is the guy who was Asking.

422
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:37,425
Scott: that disgusting annoying fanboy nerdy person is one of those people who keeps asking How come I can't find anyone to play games with because you yourself are a person No one wants to play games with.

423
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:43,386
Scott: so even if you live in nerdy town in a nerdy college or there's nerds everywhere No one wants to play with you.

424
00:27:43,707 --> 00:27:52,696
Scott: unless you change your annoying and caustic personality and your BO problem and you're all Stereotypical nerd things that some people do exhibit that guy.

425
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,020
Scott: now that's reason number one.

426
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:02,006
Rym: I have a corollary to that because if you notice that in these discussions, there's a secondary discussion of Gaming group falls apart.

427
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:18,539
Rym: every RPG discussion I've ever seen on the internet That wasn't among like RPG designers has the secondary discussion of yeah, we were playing in a D&D game But the guy playing the fighter was an asshole and the dungeon master sucked and there was drama and eventually it fell apart.

428
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:33,146
Rym: Those groups are formed by all the people who can't find gaming groups showing up at the local gaming store and It's the same reason why everyone rage quits in Left for dead.

429
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:36,060
Rym: It's the group consisting of the bottom.

430
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,730
Scott: Yes, so what do you do about this?

431
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:40,272
Scott: Right?

432
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:42,900
Scott: Oh, we're not gonna talk about what you do about this, right?

433
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,803
Scott: That's the whole point.

434
00:28:43,884 --> 00:28:45,792
Rym: is just there's sort of a meta discussion could be had about.

435
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:47,560
Rym: what do you do about the what like?

436
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,125
Rym: The caustic individual.

437
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:53,019
Rym: that brings everything down because in gaming that is a huge conversation.

438
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:59,123
Rym: recently Remember we just talked about you know, the so-called fake geek girls or fake nerd girls and that you know People.

439
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:10,709
Rym: but there is the problem and while it exists in many other parts of society it is surprisingly prevalent in Gaming more so than a lot of other places.

440
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:12,253
Rym: Yeah, or at least we notice it more.

441
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:14,540
Rym: but there is the that guy problem.

442
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:17,679
Rym: Mm-hmm even think us all the way back to our IT.

443
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:24,658
Rym: We go to our wag which was like there's like a hundred people at this club every week playing games.

444
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:28,762
Rym: people playing D&D playing shake geek play Play it.

445
00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:30,469
Scott: every game wanna play shake geek.

446
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,699
Scott: Yeah, so that was one of those guys.

447
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:53,520
Rym: We as the crew now the front row crew at RIT would basically sit down at a table like me and Scott and maybe one other person be waiting for other people to show up and legions of people would walk up to the table like hey guys you want to play X game and We turned Telling them no without telling them we didn't want to play with them into an art.

448
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,364
Scott: We had a lot of practice.

449
00:29:55,525 --> 00:30:03,432
Rym: we was to the point where we'd like be setting up a game that can take five players There are clearly only three people sitting at the table.

450
00:30:03,753 --> 00:30:04,435
Rym: dude walks up.

451
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:05,479
Rym: Hey, can I play?

452
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,607
Scott: and No, we're full bro.

453
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:08,914
Rym: We'd be like, yeah.

454
00:30:08,954 --> 00:30:10,020
Rym: Well, actually we're full.

455
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,425
Rym: We can't fit any more people in.

456
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:13,030
Scott: so that game takes five players.

457
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,535
Scott: two more people are coming then.

458
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:17,573
Scott: meanwhile later on they see that We're clearly playing with only four players.

459
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:20,217
Rym: Yep, and The only reason?

460
00:30:20,238 --> 00:30:28,440
Rym: well Usually we only got away with that because they'd be too afraid to come over and confront us and then the next time they'd be More aggressive and we'd have to come up with a better excuse.

461
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:31,535
Rym: But usually we'd have secondary and tertiary excuses.

462
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:32,540
Rym: now Scott really wouldn't lie.

463
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:40,453
Rym: so it was often on me to Scott would just like put his head down and just start like Messing with the pieces or like set up the board or whatever.

464
00:30:40,474 --> 00:30:45,735
Rym: They'd be like, oh, yeah Oh, he started to play with him But then they left and we had to like rejigger the game down or whatever.

465
00:30:45,755 --> 00:30:48,824
Rym: if something happened We lost.

466
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:52,060
Rym: we don't have enough pieces in purple so we actually couldn't play with five.

467
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,135
Rym: So does that make us the popular kids who were also jerks and in clicks in high school?

468
00:30:58,296 --> 00:30:59,440
Scott: No, it makes us smart.

469
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,395
Scott: That's why we have a gaming group because we are you know, we found good people.

470
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:11,380
Scott: we held on to them Like, you know, there was no time And we prevented any invaders who would cause the group to break up, right?

471
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,700
Scott: It's like not only does that one caustic person could destroy your group as a whole and then you've got.

472
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,214
Rym: Yeah, let me give you an example all of you out there.

473
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,580
Rym: second person not you Scott.

474
00:31:22,022 --> 00:31:24,291
Rym: so there was a person who we won't name who.

475
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:29,979
Rym: he was an interesting conundrum because Guys would just play with him and he was good at games.

476
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:37,420
Rym: He you couldn't really talk to him about much other than the game you were playing But he would play the game competently take his turn understand the rules.

477
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:39,989
Rym: He was a perfectly enjoyable person to play games with.

478
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:40,791
Scott: I know this person.

479
00:31:40,952 --> 00:31:43,320
Rym: Yep, but his eyes left with someone's mom.

480
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:44,859
Rym: yeah, so well he.

481
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:48,148
Scott: He totally real not joking.

482
00:31:48,228 --> 00:31:48,449
Rym: Yes.

483
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,472
Scott: He's not exaggerating.

484
00:31:49,552 --> 00:32:02,418
Rym: the dude caused a circle of Sex upon sex whereupon he linked a person we knew to his own mother in a relatively short number of sexual hops, but I digress.

485
00:32:03,442 --> 00:32:07,212
Rym: So the problem with this guy is that his eyes were soulless and dead.

486
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:10,000
Rym: they looked through you like death itself.

487
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:12,899
Rym: There was clearly nothing back there, but an evil dark abyss.

488
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:17,652
Rym: Guys just would be like whatever, you know intellectual whore.

489
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:18,575
Rym: Let's just play our game.

490
00:32:18,615 --> 00:32:19,920
Rym: I don't care if you eat babies.

491
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,645
Rym: We're just gonna apply.

492
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:21,914
Rym: need someone to play shake geek with.

493
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:29,479
Rym: meanwhile Every girl who would ever play games with us would not even come over to the table if that guy was there.

494
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:38,490
Rym: So we had to make sure he never played games with us or else Easily five or six other people would not come over to play.

495
00:32:38,972 --> 00:32:41,580
Rym: that sounds like silly drama, but no, it's that guy.

496
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:43,327
Rym: It's knives and Trigon.

497
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:46,620
Rym: one person can ruin the entire dynamic.

498
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:51,700
Scott: Yep, so a lot of the people looking for game online are that guy?

499
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,753
Scott: What is another reason so many people are looking for game online?

500
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,300
Rym: They don't live in a major city.

501
00:32:56,404 --> 00:32:56,880
Scott: That is right.

502
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,952
Scott: A lot of people live in the fucking sticks.

503
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:02,215
Scott: and even if I say, you know You're like I don't live in the sticks if it's.

504
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:05,900
Scott: and you know We sound like jerks when we say New York City isn't the sticks.

505
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,840
Scott: But really if you're in a suburb the population density is so low the percentage of people say it depends on the suburb.

506
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,124
Rym: I mean I grew up in a subdivision a suburb even there and you have two hundred thousand Sure people.

507
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:23,680
Scott: sure even there even today where board gaming and such is getting more popular.

508
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:27,571
Scott: What percentage of those people are the nerdy type?

509
00:33:27,611 --> 00:33:28,935
Scott: people who you could play games with?

510
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:34,598
Scott: that are not only nerdy Not only then you still got to subtract the people who are too young.

511
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:38,074
Scott: Yeah, it's attract the people who don't get along with you Scott.

512
00:33:38,134 --> 00:33:39,560
Rym: I had two regular gaming group.

513
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:50,699
Scott: You got to subtract that like those ten people who are like they get together and game by themselves But it's like, you know some families or like some you know Some couples that get together in game and they don't want to be.

514
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:56,047
Rym: Actually, I had two Semi-separate gaming groups.

515
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:56,529
Scott: Yep.

516
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:03,616
Scott: You got to subtract those people who they're gamers But they're into a specific game that you're not into their war gamers.

517
00:34:03,656 --> 00:34:04,600
Scott: They're not into your board.

518
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,031
Rym: I'm about to make a much more subtle point here.

519
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:17,715
Rym: So yes, I had two groups of friends that would get together and play games but we were Invisible to all other gamers because we did not advertise our existence.

520
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:18,858
Rym: Yeah, we did not go like.

521
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,945
Rym: hey We're forming a gaming group.

522
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:22,029
Rym: Does anyone want to join it?

523
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:33,139
Rym: No, we were all just friends and started playing games and Meanwhile all the other people who might not have a friend group already to play games with looking for gamers.

524
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:35,646
Rym: They're primarily only gonna find that guys.

525
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:36,809
Scott: Yeah, it's the.

526
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:37,851
Scott: there are very few.

527
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:43,087
Scott: even if there's plenty of gamers around enough They are not visible right there.

528
00:34:43,107 --> 00:34:44,491
Scott: Very few of them are visible.

529
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:48,616
Scott: only when the population density is very high Will you be able to find?

530
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,545
Scott: visible gamers Advertising looking for others.

531
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:57,462
Scott: All right, so there's a close geographic space that are not that guy Even.

532
00:34:57,482 --> 00:34:59,069
Scott: we go to nerd NYC board game night.

533
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:00,375
Scott: How many people are there?

534
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,169
Rym: Oh Between 20 and 40.

535
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:09,280
Scott: in the biggest goddamn city One of the most important cities in the world 40 people show up.

536
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,368
Rym: Well, they should but that's the thing 40 people.

537
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,620
Rym: and it's a rotating group of different people showing up at one event.

538
00:35:15,735 --> 00:35:20,981
Scott: You go to a similar event in Typical suburbs say where I grew up Trumbull, Connecticut, right?

539
00:35:21,282 --> 00:35:23,330
Scott: How many people you think are gonna show up for?

540
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,750
Rym: Yeah, if you're lucky three of them are that guy exactly, but it's a little more subtle than that.

541
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:29,754
Rym: It's it's the one.

542
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:35,958
Rym: the gaming groups that are healthy aren't soliciting other people So you'll never find them unless you're friends with them.

543
00:35:35,978 --> 00:35:44,175
Rym: Mm-hmm, but to there aren't as many focal point public groups that have Organization sure.

544
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:44,898
Rym: Yeah, it's true.

545
00:35:44,938 --> 00:35:46,183
Rym: There aren't even in New York City.

546
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:49,083
Rym: There aren't that many gamers Yeah, and we went to Mars.

547
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:49,730
Scott: We were lucky.

548
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,773
Scott: Despite that.

549
00:35:52,053 --> 00:36:01,061
Rym: there's nerd NYC which meets once a month and has you know a sort of community and it has a Management layered as people who run it as an organization.

550
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:03,350
Rym: They put on events they run a forum.

551
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:08,970
Rym: So there is a place to congregate and aggregate all those gamers and then sort them into groups.

552
00:36:09,452 --> 00:36:12,610
Rym: So there is a social scene for gamers.

553
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:16,630
Scott: In fact, there are multiple such, you know board game groups in New York City, right?

554
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,649
Scott: There's the naive and there's a couple other one.

555
00:36:20,151 --> 00:36:21,658
Scott: There's a d20 store boy.

556
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:23,285
Rym: You go to those net runner meetups.

557
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:24,410
Rym: There's a net runner meetup.

558
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,020
Rym: This guy like there's meetups at the complete strat.

559
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,750
Rym: There's individual gaming events little mini conventions.

560
00:36:30,072 --> 00:36:33,168
Rym: North Jersey has like ten little gaming conventions Yep.

561
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:38,950
Rym: So there's a ton of places for you to go and be social with people and find gamers.

562
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:48,058
Rym: but even there The people who meet other really good gamers at those events tend to pull away and make their own private event Even if they go to the public event.

563
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,130
Rym: and again those events are all off the radar.

564
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:54,370
Scott: And so let's say you live in someplace, you know, let's say our friends in Albany, right?

565
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:58,050
Scott: They've got some gaming stores that they can go to right and they have each other obviously.

566
00:36:58,652 --> 00:37:03,209
Scott: But those gaming stores you have a gaming store that and it's just sort of a public event like that.

567
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,529
Scott: Who's showing up at that?

568
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:08,583
Scott: It's not the person who already has friends to play a game with.

569
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:11,278
Scott: they don't need to go to the gaming store It's the creepy guy.

570
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:11,600
Rym: Yep.

571
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:17,030
Rym: So if you're the non guy Remember when we moved to art rock art Rochester when we moved to Beacon.

572
00:37:17,262 --> 00:37:23,550
Rym: Yeah We because we needed people to play games with we would drive all the way up the road to Poughkeepsie to Mars.

573
00:37:23,651 --> 00:37:24,848
Rym: Which is this board gaming group?

574
00:37:25,551 --> 00:37:29,550
Rym: Mm-hmm, and it was like that one of the bigger board gaming groups in the area that maybe eight members.

575
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:30,689
Scott: You had a lot of people.

576
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:34,342
Rym: Yeah Considering three or four of them would show up at a given meeting.

577
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:41,830
Rym: but we went up there because we were desperate Yeah, but as soon as more people we knew moved into town, we just literally never went back.

578
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:44,270
Rym: Yep, because now we had enough people to play games on our own.

579
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,696
Rym: We didn't need to go find more people.

580
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:48,468
Scott: and really Mars didn't do advertising.

581
00:37:48,528 --> 00:37:48,910
Scott: very much.

582
00:37:48,971 --> 00:38:01,746
Scott: I had to seek them out hardcore Right in order to actually find they existed and get in contact with them and they use like an old busted like just email Everybody kind of thing and not really a listserv and I made

583
00:38:01,786 --> 00:38:05,445
Rym: them a whole website That was a thousand times better and gave them the keys to it

584
00:38:05,526 --> 00:38:06,129
Scott: and they didn't use

585
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:06,230
Rym: it.

586
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,896
Rym: They didn't use it.

587
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:07,319
Rym: Eventually.

588
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:08,025
Rym: We just shut it down.

589
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:20,059
Rym: Yeah Anyway, but so if you're and that was in Poughkeepsie, which is still you know A tiny city like there's stuff going on if you're outside of one of those places There just aren't that many gamers and more importantly there aren't.

590
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,690
Rym: there isn't a social scene that caters to gamers.

591
00:38:24,153 --> 00:38:27,190
Rym: So you're kind of like shooting in the dark looking for the guy on the Rama shirt.

592
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,150
Scott: The other thing is a lot of those people who are looking for game, right?

593
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,013
Scott: A lot of them are.

594
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:36,370
Scott: just there are people who don't have a car maybe or they're kids.

595
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:47,461
Scott: A lot of them are like high school kids and it's like mate, you know if they're in a small school I mean the school I went to at hundreds of kids the one you had wed way more Yeah, but like where Emily went to school it was like a tiny ass school, right?

596
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:53,017
Scott: Yeah, but even there Pete went to school even Smaller right like the smallest schools.

597
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:58,380
Scott: It was like what are the odds that even one other person in the school is gonna You know be as nerdy as you?

598
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,827
Rym: but then again being in school Especially nowadays and my nowadays mean the last 20 years is a great place to meet gamers.

599
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:11,670
Rym: middle school I would play magic with one of like 40 other kids over lunch every day, but how many people were in that middle school?

600
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,478
Rym: Oh, I don't know 300.

601
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:13,801
Rym: Yeah.

602
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:17,601
Scott: See when I was in middle school We played magic at lunch with like four other dude.

603
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:19,870
Rym: There was the magic wait like in the cafeteria.

604
00:39:20,031 --> 00:39:22,081
Rym: There was like a set of four tables like the long ones.

605
00:39:22,122 --> 00:39:23,710
Rym: That was just all magic players.

606
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,124
Scott: Yeah, that was that was four kids at one table.

607
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:34,180
Rym: not for You know also, you know being near a college campus all those things, but we lived up in Beacon I mean even way before Scott.

608
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:45,350
Rym: when I lived up there by myself I was so desperate for gamers that other than driving back to Rochester, which I did almost every weekend I tried to go to like Marist or Vassar to check out their game.

609
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,530
Scott: We went to their gaming for hope and there were plenty of gamers.

610
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,598
Scott: No scope was cool But the thing is a lot of those gamers they're in the college.

611
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:58,790
Scott: those people in the college are never gonna look outside the college For games and it's kind of weird for an outside of college person to look into the college.

612
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,375
Scott: You know, you can my anecdote.

613
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:06,236
Rym: my anecdote was I went to one of those colleges and I went to their gaming club Which was open to outsiders.

614
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:06,757
Rym: I showed up.

615
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,262
Rym: There were like 14 people.

616
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:10,650
Rym: not bad club was the gaming club.

617
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:20,098
Rym: It was also the Wicca Club the anime club the science fiction club all in one and those people were Horrifying.

618
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:21,829
Rym: Yeah, I never went back.

619
00:40:23,091 --> 00:40:31,038
Scott: Right when you go to a super nerdy place like RIT MIT, you know Caltech something like that Yeah, or CMU sure.

620
00:40:31,058 --> 00:40:34,630
Scott: There's gonna be enough nerds that you can separate those clubs.

621
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:40,269
Scott: But if you go to like state school It's pretty much gonna be one nerd club with 14 people and you don't want to go to it.

622
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,919
Rym: It depends on the state too, but we're generalizing.

623
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:57,850
Rym: but it seems like really, you know, we're talking about all this stuff again but it really just comes down to the fact that there's a sort of adverse selection that in general and Obviously, I'm not saying all of you are like this but many of the people who are looking for a gaming group are that guy.

624
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:11,230
Rym: Thus if you're not that guy and you're looking for a gaming group It is very difficult to find a group that does not consist entirely of that guy Because anyone who has a stable gaming group falls off the radar.

625
00:41:11,812 --> 00:41:17,050
Rym: The only places gaming groups are on the radar are if you're in a college that is nerdy.

626
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:21,470
Rym: You're in a school at a convention or your or you go to conventions.

627
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,778
Rym: But then great you go to a convention.

628
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:25,163
Rym: and so Scott how come this?

629
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:28,414
Rym: you go to a PAX you go to a kinetic Con you go to any gaming con.

630
00:41:29,036 --> 00:41:33,009
Rym: There's still the panels and the meetups that are all like how to find a gaming group.

631
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:39,407
Scott: Yeah, there's one other reason that I can think of why it is hard to find game.

632
00:41:40,391 --> 00:41:48,460
Scott: All right, there are people where even if maybe they're lucky in their general area They found each other and in their general area, none of them are that guy.

633
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:51,910
Scott: but yet they still can't get the gaming group together.

634
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,752
Scott: It still sucks.

635
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:57,265
Scott: And the reason for this is they get together because on paper, they're all gamers.

636
00:41:57,305 --> 00:41:58,930
Scott: They should game together.

637
00:41:59,051 --> 00:42:00,080
Scott: They live in the same area.

638
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:01,190
Scott: Why wouldn't they game together?

639
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:07,169
Scott: But in fact, they look for they are not the same kind of gamer and they're gonna spot it.

640
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,821
Scott: Yeah, their gaming ways are not compatible.

641
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:14,513
Scott: even you know, people look at gaming is like this one thing It's like no, no, no, no, no.

642
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:15,617
Scott: that guy.

643
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:31,637
Scott: He's a war gamer and his the thing he cares about is the historical accuracy He's geeking out about like yeah, that tank was actually used in World War two on in the in this front You just want to play shaky Yeah, you are into.

644
00:42:31,697 --> 00:42:31,978
Scott: it's like.

645
00:42:32,018 --> 00:42:37,610
Scott: maybe you even like war games, but you care about you know, trying to win What is the way to win this game?

646
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,573
Scott: and of course you're doing.

647
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:47,003
Scott: you're trying to figure out the smartest thing to do possible and the other guys getting upset because Oh my god, that is not even close to what happened historically.

648
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:47,946
Scott: What is wrong with you?

649
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:49,030
Scott: You're so crazy.

650
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:51,950
Scott: Now it's like, you know, sure both of you are legit geeks.

651
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,582
Scott: Maybe you're both socially not inept, but you can't.

652
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,790
Scott: you're not compatible in terms of this game.

653
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,870
Scott: There's no bull who they might just want to play games.

654
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,630
Scott: You know, they're the kind of person who plays games for fun.

655
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:10,643
Scott: their favorite games are like apples to apples and you know dicks it and these kinds of games where it's just you know, You know cards against humanity.

656
00:43:10,683 --> 00:43:11,650
Scott: Those are their favorite games.

657
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,884
Scott: But they also like to play games like Agricola or settlers because they like to trade with people.

658
00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:19,562
Scott: or they like cute little animals You know and they like to have fun with the game.

659
00:43:19,803 --> 00:43:20,950
Rym: They don't really care about winning.

660
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,398
Rym: Well in my experience again not compatible.

661
00:43:23,438 --> 00:43:32,148
Rym: the most common sort of poisonings because you know That guy is one of a whole set of poisonous people when it comes to a gaming group.

662
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:35,890
Rym: now Poisonous person doesn't mean bad as a person.

663
00:43:36,271 --> 00:43:41,610
Rym: It just means they're the kind of person who will be able to destroy a gaming group.

664
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:48,450
Rym: For example the person who is into gaming but brings someone with them who isn't and that person wants to do other things.

665
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:53,430
Rym: Or the person who doesn't actually want to play games but shows up anyway.

666
00:43:54,454 --> 00:44:04,430
Rym: Though all those different kinds of people destabilize these groups But in my experience the most common one are just the people who take too long on their turns.

667
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:12,169
Rym: That's also a big one because that is what people complain about the most which amazes me because the people who complain about it are People I complain about behind their backs.

668
00:44:12,452 --> 00:44:13,969
Scott: I heard a story from someone the other day.

669
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:22,650
Scott: They talked about how they had a person in their group who is a good person in fact a smart person a lawyer But they took too long in their turn so they did the same thing.

670
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:26,747
Scott: I just you know you said earlier where they sort of you know didn't invite them back to gaming night.

671
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:28,393
Scott: the person asked hey When's gaming night?

672
00:44:28,434 --> 00:44:29,939
Scott: I'd like to have board games again.

673
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:30,943
Scott: Yeah, okay.

674
00:44:31,344 --> 00:44:32,408
Scott: It doesn't exist anymore.

675
00:44:32,428 --> 00:44:32,870
Scott: Yeah, it does.

676
00:44:32,952 --> 00:44:36,385
Scott: It's not with you and the person took too long in their turn.

677
00:44:36,406 --> 00:44:40,786
Scott: and Here's the real problem right is that there was a game.

678
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:41,830
Scott: I think they were playing talisman.

679
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:42,937
Scott: Which is that you know?

680
00:44:42,978 --> 00:44:43,038
Scott: the?

681
00:44:43,078 --> 00:44:44,608
Scott: oh yeah the dungeon Crawley?

682
00:44:46,271 --> 00:44:47,013
Scott: Games workshop game.

683
00:44:47,053 --> 00:44:53,231
Scott: I think right and the somebody was playing talisman for the first time and they were playing it when slow guy was There.

684
00:44:53,251 --> 00:45:06,849
Scott: all right that slow guy had been kicked out a while ago But that person who had only played talisman once with slow guy Didn't want to play talisman again, and they said that game takes forever, and they're like no no no no It's just because you played it with slow guy.

685
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,679
Scott: Right but meanwhile that person is now ruined the game.

686
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,849
Scott: now that person is another person is seeing the game differently because They played it with that person the only time that they played it.

687
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:24,224
Scott: So now they had a false belief that the game was the cause of the slowness when in fact I mean the game is not the super fastest, but they played it with us.

688
00:45:24,284 --> 00:45:25,268
Scott: really really slow guy.

689
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:29,470
Rym: now What's funny is if I think back to RIT anime, and I posted about this in the forum a long time ago.

690
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:32,179
Rym: But anime clubs kind of had the same problem.

691
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:40,933
Rym: if there'd be the few people who were toxic to the culture of the group And would scare girls away to be perfectly honest They scared girls away from the club But they'd be hey.

692
00:45:41,174 --> 00:45:52,678
Rym: so we as the leaders of the club actually had to pull some sort of Nefarious Machiavellian sort of mean Shenanigans to prevent that from happening.

693
00:45:52,738 --> 00:45:58,576
Rym: we would actually have people stationed at the door to Be the first one.

694
00:45:58,596 --> 00:46:12,799
Rym: so the first person who engages a new girl who shows up is not one of the creepy Toxic dudes, but it's one of our plants or we would have someone go and distract the fanboys and pull them away from Conversations with the new girls who arrived

695
00:46:13,161 --> 00:46:14,990
Scott: even in even in a fandom like anime.

696
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:16,937
Scott: Maybe you want to get an anime club together right?

697
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:22,842
Scott: there are people who would enjoy different animes in different ways Right and enjoy different aspects.

698
00:46:22,882 --> 00:46:35,940
Scott: there might be someone who just really Likes robots and wants to see them explode and someone else who really likes a romance stories and someone else who is a pervert and Even though they're all anime fans They're not really gonna get along as an anime club.

699
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:41,750
Scott: so even though they were lucky enough to have three whole anime fans in A tiny ass town they don't go together.

700
00:46:42,192 --> 00:46:42,834
Scott: It's just right.

701
00:46:42,895 --> 00:46:47,473
Scott: so all of them go to the internet and say looking for animes in tiny town And they see each other.

702
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,256
Scott: and that's it now.

703
00:46:48,276 --> 00:46:52,090
Rym: I have this really sort of sad suspicion that it's possible.

704
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:54,719
Rym: This is primarily an American phenomenon in gaming.

705
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:05,983
Rym: I don't know because Luke Burrage when he visited us a while ago Made the comments that his experiences in America led He to paraphrase him very loosely.

706
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:06,244
Scott: remember.

707
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:09,880
Scott: He's in a big city of Berlin Just like he was playing games in New

708
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,965
Rym: York with us at

709
00:47:11,025 --> 00:47:12,472
Scott: a nerdy yet together Yeah, but

710
00:47:12,532 --> 00:47:23,800
Rym: even then he's basically like how come all the gamers in America are the scary dudes who don't know each other's names and Really only use each other to play games.

711
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:23,981
Rym: Well.

712
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:25,910
Rym: How come everyone's so socially inept?

713
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:30,990
Scott: Because not like that in Berlin right because their games are more mainstream.

714
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:35,722
Scott: Just everyday people will play a game casually and not as a focused hobby.

715
00:47:35,742 --> 00:47:36,424
Scott: right?

716
00:47:36,464 --> 00:47:41,242
Scott: there are people who you know like my mom Will play a board game if you try to make her play it or I

717
00:47:41,543 --> 00:47:43,633
Rym: remember trying to get your family to play up And anagrams that

718
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:52,904
Scott: right you can get my family to play a game, but of their own initiative They will not go and seek out Any game more serious than like mahjong or scrabble or whatever.

719
00:47:52,924 --> 00:47:57,129
Scott: and even then while they those are games They like they will rarely seek them out.

720
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,120
Scott: I think my aunt plays rummy cube with some people every week.

721
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,067
Scott: right and they play mahjong, and that's about it.

722
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:04,033
Scott: right so You know.

723
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:04,996
Scott: but in other countries.

724
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:09,390
Scott: It's like people hang out in a bar and just play a game and especially Germany, right?

725
00:48:10,152 --> 00:48:11,525
Scott: That doesn't happen here right?

726
00:48:11,585 --> 00:48:12,090
Scott: when is you know?

727
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:17,470
Scott: There's I think a couple bars in town that have board games there and usually not super serious ones.

728
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,722
Scott: There's one snakes and lattes in Canada.

729
00:48:19,783 --> 00:48:20,406
Scott: There's one.

730
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:21,050
Scott: That's it.

731
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:21,934
Scott: I mean, it's crazy.

732
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:25,430
Scott: that place is awesome and packed ever and I have to make reservations to get there.

733
00:48:25,671 --> 00:48:28,842
Rym: But again, there's one as a gaming club with a cover charge.

734
00:48:29,063 --> 00:48:29,885
Rym: right about that.

735
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:31,190
Scott: You would not blink twice.

736
00:48:31,371 --> 00:48:41,290
Scott: I think I haven't been there right, but I'm guessing Tell me if I'm wrong that seeing a copy of settlers in pretty much any bar in Germany would not be a strange sight.

737
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,690
Rym: Not nearly as strange as seeing it here not nearly now.

738
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,175
Rym: They're all interestingly here.

739
00:48:46,195 --> 00:48:49,204
Scott: you get here or at least this much at least this much.

740
00:48:49,525 --> 00:49:01,650
Scott: if someone if you put settlers out Place in the United States in a random bar, especially not in a major city people might come up and ask you What is that thing like when those prostitutes asked us what it was that that anime would be a big attention-getter?

741
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,488
Scott: Yeah, you did that in you know.

742
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,074
Scott: Perhaps we were able to.

743
00:49:05,134 --> 00:49:10,390
Rym: those prostitutes were more interested in this weird game with hexes and cubes than they were in their job.

744
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:23,570
Scott: Yes, if you did that in Germany, you know even at a bar where board games are not common I doubt you would turn many heads Guessing it's it's a rarity to even see like the scrabble set or the trivial pursuit.

745
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:32,938
Scott: Yeah, every someplace, you know coffee shops Especially a lot of them seem to have a scrabble or checkers or a chest sitting around But it's rare to see it get used.

746
00:49:32,998 --> 00:49:35,807
Scott: It usually sits there and gets maybe used like once a week.

747
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:36,649
Scott: Yeah

748
00:49:38,411 --> 00:50:03,702
Rym: so I still think that the that guy problem is the biggest problem because Just colloquially even at conventions if I'm looking for strangers to play games and by that guy It's not just the that scary guy It's the social interaction stuff in general when I'm at packs the hardcore hat Like it's the gaming con in America and even there if I find a stranger who's kind of milling around like hey You want to play a game?

749
00:50:03,702 --> 00:50:12,969
Rym: 50/50 odds on them having some problem with the game or not being able to play it because they're Socially awkward or can't interact with me.

750
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:15,881
Rym: Yep I mean we were running a game.

751
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,690
Rym: I forget if this was a. I think it was at PAX.

752
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:18,695
Rym: Might have been.

753
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:21,249
Rym: at that mag fest the dude wanted to play burning wheel with us.

754
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:29,744
Rym: So we ran burning wheel with like these three dudes and then ten minutes in the game one dude Just like I. I can't do this and he just walked away.

755
00:50:30,086 --> 00:50:30,909
Rym: Yeah, we're like what?

756
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:32,935
Scott: What at mag fest?

757
00:50:33,317 --> 00:50:34,362
Rym: Yeah, it was mag fest.

758
00:50:34,402 --> 00:50:34,623
Scott: Yep.

759
00:50:34,945 --> 00:50:44,650
Rym: It was the first mag fest we went to but I I hate to say this but I blow a lot of Strangers off because it is within a second of talking to them.

760
00:50:44,670 --> 00:51:02,262
Rym: I realized that I will never be able to enjoy playing a game with them because I can't interact with them socially comfortably in or out of the context of the game and the gaming culture and the taking the turn stuff is secondary to the Person just doesn't jive with me culturally on a fundamental level.

761
00:51:02,403 --> 00:51:11,468
Scott: Yep, but also the geography and the People who aren't actually after the same thing that you are after even though you both want to play games.

762
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:18,027
Scott: Right, you both actually want something completely different from the experience and thus you are not compatible and cannot achieve that.

763
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:18,870
Scott: your goals together.

764
00:51:19,114 --> 00:51:19,828
Rym: I think we're like that.

765
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:27,969
Rym: Look at what we just said a little while ago about the soulless guy Who was fine to play games with if you didn't care that girls were afraid of him?

766
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:30,624
Rym: Yeah, and wouldn't come near your table even girls who didn't know him.

767
00:51:30,644 --> 00:51:31,670
Rym: It's just he had this body language.

768
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,379
Rym: He's a creepy dude.

769
00:51:32,682 --> 00:51:33,310
Rym: Don't get us wrong.

770
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:38,603
Rym: We still would play games with him occasionally because we wanted someone to play games with.

771
00:51:38,844 --> 00:51:43,825
Scott: it was basically an AI and he could play Games properly - yeah, he understood the rules.

772
00:51:43,886 --> 00:51:44,690
Scott: He played quickly.

773
00:51:45,011 --> 00:51:48,140
Rym: This is a Woody Allen intellectual horror situation.

774
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,630
Rym: We were using him for his gaming AI and nothing more.

775
00:51:51,851 --> 00:51:55,328
Rym: Yeah, we would not interact with him outside of the context of a game of settlers.

776
00:51:55,549 --> 00:52:00,304
Scott: Nope I guess sometimes he might have followed us to dinner And we wouldn't really talk to him that.

777
00:52:00,344 --> 00:52:10,203
Rym: God, you know How many times we would like leave a gaming night and a bunch of people would follow us and we we all had this code Of being able to say yeah, we're all gonna go home.

778
00:52:10,224 --> 00:52:10,706
Rym: We're done.

779
00:52:10,766 --> 00:52:11,490
Rym: going back to my dorm.

780
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:16,950
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna regroup in that quad over there reconvene in the quad like exactly an hour later.

781
00:52:17,812 --> 00:52:20,690
Rym: I remember one time a dude was there waiting for us like he'd figured it out.

782
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:23,206
Rym: That was a bad day bad day.

783
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:25,503
Rym: so yeah, I don't know.

784
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:28,941
Rym: the moral is other than Seriously, look at yourself.

785
00:52:29,002 --> 00:52:29,789
Rym: Don't be that guy.

786
00:52:30,472 --> 00:52:33,181
Scott: I mean if you are that guy you can un be that guy.

787
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:35,389
Scott: and the thing is you might not be that guy.

788
00:52:35,509 --> 00:52:35,790
Scott: overall.

789
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:43,769
Scott: You might be just a little bit that guy but in all honesty, but being a little bit that guy is Incredibly irritating to people who are not at all that guy.

790
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:47,625
Rym: So if you find yourself, I'm being perfectly just I want to I want to give good advice.

791
00:52:47,705 --> 00:53:00,585
Rym: if you find yourself Looking for gaming groups regularly finding them and it never seems to work out You need to be really introspective and really honest with yourself and try to figure out why.

792
00:53:00,605 --> 00:53:03,248
Scott: and if you can't find people at all move.

793
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:12,153
Scott: and If you find people and you know, it sort of you know, it's it's like, you know You had to determine.

794
00:53:12,214 --> 00:53:15,590
Scott: is it really you being that guy which is actually more likely?

795
00:53:16,574 --> 00:53:23,283
Rym: If you're if the gaming groups having problems and you cannot identify That guy cuz 90% of the time there is a that guy?

796
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:30,450
Scott: if you cannot find him He's probably you know, and if you think you've identified him really think hard.

797
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:39,749
Scott: Is that guy you've identified actually that guy or is he someone who you just really don't like because he notices You're that guy and is really antagonistic?

798
00:53:40,992 --> 00:53:41,998
Rym: An RIT anime?

799
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:48,210
Rym: all the that guys hated Scott Hated him because they thought he was that guy.

800
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:53,986
Scott: But no I was the guy who's noticed that they were that guy and went down on them and said you're that guy.

801
00:53:54,067 --> 00:54:03,070
Rym: Scott's job Which he was very good at was to drive those guys out of conversations when they were being creepy to save everybody else.

802
00:54:03,813 --> 00:54:11,342
Rym: Scott was perhaps an expert at this gray shade Because we played good cop bad cop and I was the nice guy.

803
00:54:11,362 --> 00:54:15,295
Rym: I'd laugh at the jokes and you know Man we were mean.

804
00:54:15,516 --> 00:54:19,313
Rym: Yeah, but no seriously in all honesty being that guy It might not be.

805
00:54:19,393 --> 00:54:23,530
Rym: I mean, you know, you're probably all imagining that guy as the smelly awkward guy who wants to play shit geek.

806
00:54:24,551 --> 00:54:31,918
Rym: It's not necessarily that you might be that guy in the sense that you want to play hardcore games for serious And no one else does to that group.

807
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:35,130
Rym: You're that guy even if you're not a bad guy.

808
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,836
Scott: Yeah, you might actually play the games.

809
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:40,790
Scott: fine play them quickly play by the rules, but that's not what they want, right?

810
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:48,430
Scott: But you or even you know, you might play the way that they play But you just might not like have anything to talk about or say weird things.

811
00:54:48,691 --> 00:54:58,239
Rym: They're all if they talk about nothing, but I was skiing in Milan last weekend and You just don't intersect with that culture.

812
00:54:58,259 --> 00:54:58,861
Rym: It's fine.

813
00:54:58,901 --> 00:55:02,030
Rym: I can work out if you go skiing in Milan every weekend.

814
00:55:02,572 --> 00:55:03,898
Rym: I don't even know if there is skiing in Milan.

815
00:55:03,918 --> 00:55:04,480
Rym: I don't think so.

816
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:05,645
Scott: I don't know where that is.

817
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:14,739
Rym: Anyway, if your culture doesn't line up you're that guy even if they being that guy is not bad It's not bad to not go skiing in Milan.

818
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,849
Rym: It's just you're that guy for that group.

819
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:19,247
Rym: But you might also be the smelly guy.

820
00:55:20,675 --> 00:55:24,674
Scott: Check check your breath You can always ask.

821
00:55:24,894 --> 00:55:31,908
Scott: the problem is most people just can't deal with drama and they can't tell you honestly You think you're that guy?

822
00:55:32,391 --> 00:55:36,124
Scott: Come see me at a convention and I will tell you how much of that guy you are.

823
00:55:36,224 --> 00:55:50,674
Rym: if you actually honestly want to know Be warned we're probably gonna be pretty accurate and you'll either you're really gonna feel great after you talk to us or You're gonna feel really you can trust that we will be a hundred percent honest.

824
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:54,940
Rym: I think we'll leave it at that.

825
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:57,619
Rym: I don't think anyone will ever take us up on that offer.

826
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:07,678
Rym: This Has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
