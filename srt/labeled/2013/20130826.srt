1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,307
Rym: It's Monday, August 26th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,307 --> 00:00:10,508
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:13,920
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,570
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,100
Rym: Tonight, online gambling.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,398
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,820
Rym: So I got a little bit of a conundrum.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,465
Rym: Okay.

9
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:28,128
Rym: I got a Sprint cell phone.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,000
Rym: You know, 4G works pretty great.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,720
Rym: Unlimited data with the old grandfather Sprint plans that are awesome.

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,299
Scott: I'm pretty sure they still have unlimited data.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,127
Rym: They may or may not.

14
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:36,410
Rym: I don't know.

15
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,200
Rym: Mine's just super cheap.

16
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:41,172
Rym: But my trouble is it's not LTE 4G.

17
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:41,613
Rym: It's WiMAX 4G.

18
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:48,360
Rym: And WiMAX is slowly disappearing.

19
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:55,540
Rym: So I don't have a lot of options here because all modern cell phones that are on iPhones suck.

20
00:00:56,842 --> 00:01:00,020
Rym: And I do own a Nexus 4, which is a great phone.

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,376
Rym: It's Pentaband, GSM, just with SIM cards for travel.

22
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,120
Rym: Like I use it for work.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,700
Scott: It's gigantic.

24
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:07,633
Rym: It's huge, but it's also not 4G.

25
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:10,292
Scott: Now, Conrad- I was in Nexus 4, not 4G.

26
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:11,748
Rym: It's not 4G.

27
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:12,579
Rym: That's why it's cheap.

28
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,260
Scott: Google Nexus 4.

29
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,320
Rym: It's not 4G, Scott.

30
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:15,936
Scott: What?

31
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:19,133
Rym: A lot of smartphones are not 4G, you realize.

32
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:20,700
Rym: Even ones that are coming out now.

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:21,926
Scott: That's incredible.

34
00:01:21,946 --> 00:01:22,493
Scott: That's ridiculous.

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,426
Rym: Because people don't care about it.

36
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:26,959
Rym: Only super nerds care about it.

37
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:29,040
Rym: And the Nexus 4 is super cheap.

38
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,039
Rym: Now, there is the fact that it does have the chips in it to do 4G.

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,420
Rym: But it does not supposedly have the antenna required to do it fully.

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,332
Rym: Our friend Conistrad did one of the hacks.

41
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,220
Rym: Radio fuckery to enable it.

42
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:45,920
Scott: And it seems to work fine.

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,048
Scott: Wow, it really isn't 4G.

44
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:47,793
Scott: That's crazy.

45
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:50,079
Scott: that the top of the line Android phone- I can't believe you didn't know that.

46
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,640
Rym: The top of the line Android phone- 4G does not exist in most places, Scott.

47
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:55,620
Rym: It is not a concern for most people.

48
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,152
Scott: What about the Galaxy Express 4?

49
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:58,180
Scott: Isn't it the same damn thing?

50
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:00,640
Scott: The Galaxy Express 4?

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,680
Scott: Isn't it almost the same phone?

52
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,119
Rym: I heard the 3.9 was really fast.

53
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,900
Rym: It only has 4G capabilities, possibly, because they use a generic chip that has the 4G stuff in it.

54
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,320
Rym: It doesn't have the right antenna.

55
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,600
Rym: There's tons of ways to enable that radio if you fuck around.

56
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,800
Scott: But it doesn't have the right antenna.

57
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:20,260
Rym: But it works fine according to Conrad.

58
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,040
Rym: So I'm waiting for him to let me know the fullness because it works fine.

59
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:28,200
Rym: He enabled 4G, as many people on the internet have.

60
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:33,480
Rym: But I've read numerous reports that its signal strength is not that great.

61
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,719
Rym: And as a result, it ends up using more battery.

62
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,060
Scott: Well, it's gonna do that anyway.

63
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,900
Rym: But more battery than it should.

64
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,120
Rym: So I'm waiting to see if there's any confirmation.

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,930
Scott: Is there some sort of case you could put on it.

66
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,117
Scott: that would be an antenna?

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,760
Rym: Maybe two, but I have not found any hobbyist that did anything like that.

68
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,300
Scott: You have tons of money, Vice President.

69
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,658
Scott: Why don't you just go get a Samsung Galaxy S whatever that has 4G?

70
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,940
Rym: Because then I'll own three perfectly good smartphones.

71
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,817
Scott: Sell the other ones.

72
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,438
Rym: They're not worth that much.

73
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:03,160
Scott: They're worth more than zero.

74
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,140
Rym: The reason I have the Nexus 4 is because it's pentaband and it works overseas great.

75
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,119
Rym: Like in Australia, it was stupidly fast.

76
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,700
Rym: Despite not being 4G because of the HSPA+, whatever.

77
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,140
Rym: But my conundrum is not really phone because the 4G thing doesn't matter that much.

78
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:20,519
Rym: 3G is also stupid fast for what I use a phone for.

79
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:29,500
Rym: My problem is if I want to have just one device, I can either go with AT&T, which I figured would be expensive.

80
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:30,900
Scott: It's way more expensive.

81
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,480
Rym: It's ridiculously expensive.

82
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,200
Rym: I'd be looking at 90 bucks before tax and fees and whatever minimum.

83
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:37,959
Scott: That's what I'm paying.

84
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,600
Rym: Or you could go T-Mobile and that's great, except it won't fucking work at conventions if experience is any indicator.

85
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,345
Scott: I don't know.

86
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:46,360
Scott: I haven't seen people.

87
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:50,800
Scott: People sort of get the idea that T-Mobile is smaller network, whatever.

88
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,020
Scott: I know people using it and not having any problems.

89
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,700
Rym: I do too and that's not the impression I get.

90
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,720
Rym: The impression I get is that its coverage is fine, but at events like conventions where there's tons of people.

91
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,060
Scott: Who have you met at a convention where T-Mobile is having a problem?

92
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,800
Scott: Bunch of our listeners.

93
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,717
Rym: They'll always be hanging around like by Pony Ops and they'll be like, "Man, I can't get any

94
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:09,099
Rym: signal.".

95
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:12,900
Rym: And I'm sitting here with my non-T-Mobile with four bars of full data.

96
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:13,738
Scott: I've never seen that.

97
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:15,200
Rym: I've run into that frequently.

98
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,339
Scott: I don't think you'll have a problem.

99
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,499
Rym: I think you just don't pay attention to people who are around you saying things.

100
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:22,240
Scott: Listen, it's not a problem.

101
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,160
Scott: You're not going to the middle of nowhere.

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,560
Rym: That's not what the complaint ever was.

103
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,978
Rym: The complaint that I see...

104
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,180
Scott: None of the networks really always work when there's a ton of people around.

105
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,880
Rym: Oh yeah, but in my experience, every time some listener's been hanging around us...

106
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,560
Scott: So you're just going to make a decision based on random anecdotal evidence?

107
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:40,759
Rym: I haven't made a decision yet.

108
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,020
Rym: I'm saying that is the anecdotal evidence I have.

109
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,580
Rym: That people with T-Mobile seem to have more problems at the conventions I am at where I simultaneously do not have problems.

110
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:57,320
Scott: I've seen most people having problems at conventions who do not have T-Mobile because there's more people on those other networks and there's less people on T-Mobile.

111
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,880
Scott: So there's less clogging them up on those frequencies.

112
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,300
Rym: But T-Mobile might not have as much coverage in these areas.

113
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,120
Scott: They have coverage in every major populated place.

114
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,620
Scott: They only don't have coverage in the states.

115
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,640
Rym: Coverage and as much coverage are not the same thing.

116
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:10,760
Scott: They have plenty.

117
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,831
Scott: My co-workers have T-Mobile.

118
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,780
Scott: They basically have no problems.

119
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,847
Scott: They don't even have the voice plan.

120
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:16,460
Scott: They're just using data in Google Voice.

121
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,520
Scott: And they have no issues whatsoever.

122
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:22,440
Scott: They're getting the full signal pretty much everywhere.

123
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:31,580
Rym: Yeah, but the biggest problem is if I drop Sprint to go with T-Mobile or AT&T, I lose my direct Google Voice integration.

124
00:05:31,883 --> 00:05:32,339
Scott: Wah wah.

125
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,320
Rym: Because that was great and existed and basically is not offered and does not exist anymore.

126
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:40,920
Rym: So if I ever leave my current plan, that's gone forever.

127
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:52,080
Rym: And I've got to tell you, it's pretty great to have my actual phone number ring all my phones at the same time and my computers and have spam filtering for phone calls and have transcription of all my voicemails in Google.

128
00:05:53,342 --> 00:06:01,200
Rym: If I give that up, then I've got to start giving people my Google Voice number, which has the delay, or my main number, which will use T-Mobile's or AT&T's voicemail.

129
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:05,140
Scott: I would just go get a 4G Android phone.

130
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:07,820
Rym: That doesn't solve my problem of Google Voice Direct.

131
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:09,720
Scott: And use it with your Sprint.

132
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:15,320
Rym: The point is that if I buy a new phone, I want one phone that I use everywhere.

133
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,480
Scott: Right, so you get a Sprint phone.

134
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:17,661
Rym: Sprint?

135
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,712
Rym: I can't, what, a Sprint phone.

136
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:21,060
Rym: A CDMA phone.

137
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,980
Scott: Yeah, you can get a Sprint, a world phone from Sprint.

138
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,119
Rym: Yeah, Sprint's world phones suck fucking ass.

139
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,108
Scott: Let's see what they have.

140
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,200
Scott: They have the HTC One.

141
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:29,594
Rym: Yep.

142
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,181
Scott: Samsung Galaxy S, 3 and 4.

143
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:33,245
Scott: Yep.

144
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:35,500
Scott: And iPhones.

145
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,900
Scott: I guess you can get the HTC Evo, you don't want that one.

146
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,518
Scott: Alright, so you can get the HTC One or the Galaxy S4.

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,640
Rym: Yeah, so those are unlocked, out of the box, and 4G, and work on GSM and CDMA.

148
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:50,217
Scott: I'm sure they do.

149
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:58,760
Rym: Anyway, I've got to decide what to do, because my old Nexus S is starting to have a few issues.

150
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,780
Rym: Battery's not lasting that long anymore, and buying a new battery costs enough to where I wouldn't even bother.

151
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,620
Rym: I was getting a new phone.

152
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:09,580
Rym: And it's actually starting to be super slow now that Google updated its hangouts.

153
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,451
Scott: Okay.

154
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:12,120
Rym: Okay.

155
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:15,480
Rym: You have a shitty iPhone, so you don't have any opinion on this.

156
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:18,299
Scott: You mean I have no problems because I have a great iPhone?

157
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,540
Rym: You mean your iPhone doesn't work with Google Glass?

158
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:22,072
Scott: That's not iPhone's fault.

159
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:23,180
Scott: There's nothing wrong with the iPhone.

160
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,060
Rym: Ah, but the fact remains.

161
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,636
Scott: The beta Google Glass does not do everything?

162
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:28,260
Scott: Yeah, no kidding.

163
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,300
Rym: Yeah, but it doesn't do the most basic thing, the GPS thing, the primary thing.

164
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,860
Scott: The Google Glass doesn't even work with the Google apps, even though they just said that they're working on it.

165
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,031
Scott: Yeah.

166
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:36,085
Scott: All right?

167
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:37,459
Scott: Yeah, the beta thing.

168
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,060
Rym: But I wonder when you'll get GPS, because that's kind of a killer app for that thing.

169
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,800
Scott: Probably after iOS 7 comes out and fixes Bluetooth.

170
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,462
Rym: Maybe.

171
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:46,971
Rym: Maybe.

172
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:48,360
Rym: Anyway, got any news?

173
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,744
Scott: Almost definitely.

174
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:50,587
Scott: I do have news.

175
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:54,420
Scott: Something that nerds have been waiting for for a long time finally happened.

176
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:07,919
Scott: Stevie B, and not the one you're thinking of, the tech one, not the anime cel-drawn one, has said that within 12 months he's going to retire pretty much as soon as they find someone to replace him.

177
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:15,160
Scott: So, of course, you know, the whole true story never really comes out in any sort of confirmed way.

178
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,524
Rym: Well, let's see.

179
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:17,140
Rym: What has Microsoft done recently?

180
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,380
Rym: The Windows phone kind of didn't go anywhere.

181
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:24,680
Rym: The Windows 8, wildly hated, as opposed to Windows 7, which was widely loved.

182
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:33,460
Scott: Supposedly the straw that broke the camel's back, so they say, is the $900 million write-off for the failed Windows RT tablets.

183
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,014
Scott: Even though the Surface Pro is good, the Surface RT went.

184
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:37,100
Scott: pfft, right?

185
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,558
Scott: And they're trying to sell off the Surface RTs at low prices to schools and stuff just to get rid of them.

186
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:43,839
Scott: And to get some amount of money back.

187
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,860
Scott: Because no one wants your shitty tablet that really sucks and doesn't do anything.

188
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:50,779
Scott: We like the one that actually runs Windows and is for reals.

189
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:54,360
Rym: That's what I run into a lot with tablets in general.

190
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:56,227
Rym: For example, Emily's tablet, right?

191
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,694
Rym: It's an actual laptop.

192
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:59,000
Rym: It's just a tablet form factor.

193
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:00,800
Rym: It's a full-on computer.

194
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,691
Rym: And a lot of apps try to be like, "Oh, I see you're running a tablet.

195
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,198
Rym: Let me give you my bullshit tablet version of X, Y, and

196
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:08,238
Rym: Z.".

197
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:13,140
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, well, I would like that if your bullshit tablet version was actually fucking good.

198
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,420
Rym: Or if I'm actually on a shitty tablet.

199
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:16,990
Scott: Yeah, but I'm not.

200
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,480
Scott: I'm on a for reals tablet.

201
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Rym: And I think tablet-level shit OSs really don't need to exist in the long run.

202
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:29,360
Rym: Tablet will just be a form factor for a computer.

203
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,830
Scott: But look, the iPad, right?

204
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:32,040
Scott: It's like no one's complaining.

205
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,954
Scott: You know, the iPad is basically the same thing as the Surface RT.

206
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,000
Scott: It's a limited tablet.

207
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,356
Scott: The thing is, an iPad app on the iPad is not some shitty version you don't want.

208
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:42,660
Scott: It's actually good.

209
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,903
Rym: I think it's more subtle than that.

210
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:52,100
Rym: If you're going to use an iPad, the limited device, Apple kind of wins in the limited interface arena right now.

211
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:57,719
Rym: If you want an interface that's simple and mostly just works, Apple's pretty much got it down.

212
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:15,469
Scott: It's really just, with the Surface RT, if you get these apps trying to run in a tablet mode, but they're actually full apps and they're trying to make their user... It's not like a simple website.

213
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:18,518
Scott: Notice only the really simple websites can be responsive.

214
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,379
Scott: Any website that actually has a lot going on can't really do that.

215
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:24,304
Scott: It's the same thing.

216
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:28,720
Scott: You have an app like Photoshop and you try to make a tablet interface for it.

217
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,803
Scott: It's like,

218
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:30,043
Scott: "Eh.".

219
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,512
Scott: That's why they have Photoshop Touch, which is completely different.

220
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:34,394
Scott: I have it on my iPhone.

221
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,256
Scott: It's actually pretty good.

222
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:36,660
Scott: Anyway...

223
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,700
Rym: In general, people seem very happy about him leaving and it seems like the market's also very happy.

224
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:45,691
Scott: People don't know the history necessarily.

225
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:47,640
Scott: They might know developers, developers, right?

226
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:57,900
Scott: Basically, when Microsoft started, it was Bill Gates and then shortly after, one of the earliest people they brought on was Steve Vollmer and he was the sales guy.

227
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,122
Scott: He wasn't a tech guy.

228
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:00,365
Scott: He was the sales guy.

229
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:05,096
Scott: You can even go on YouTube and see videos of him in commercials trying to sell Windows in the '80s and the '90s.

230
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:07,924
Scott: That's what he did.

231
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:12,500
Scott: He was a salesman and he was in second in command after Bill Gates, the tech guy.

232
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,315
Scott: Then Bill Gates retired, he came up and was the number one guy.

233
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:17,520
Scott: He went from number one guy being a tech guy.

234
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:19,780
Rym: He also apparently has the Legion of Honor for real.

235
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:21,483
Scott: Yeah.

236
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:26,840
Scott: He went from number one guy being the tech guy to number one guy being the sales guy.

237
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:30,012
Scott: He did what sales guy does, right?

238
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,359
Scott: He didn't do what tech guy would do.

239
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:37,552
Scott: Even though he did some good things, the net effect was not so good.

240
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:40,580
Scott: Some of it was his fault and some of it wasn't his fault.

241
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:47,380
Rym: Part of your job as a CEO is basically to where you make it all your fault.

242
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,064
Rym: You're kind of the escape hatch.

243
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,789
Rym: The company's going in a bad direction.

244
00:11:52,331 --> 00:12:03,980
Rym: Even if you weren't the one actually making it go in that direction, your job is to step down to tell the world, "Yes, we're changing direction," even if you had nothing to do with it in the first place.

245
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:07,287
Scott: It's like he was there for a long-ass time, first of all.

246
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:13,060
Scott: Another thing is that they recently had a reorganization which sort of fixed some of their problems.

247
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:20,978
Scott: Someone wrote an article and it was like, "Bomber looked around the room after the reorg and realized he was the only old fogey

248
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:21,279
Scott: left.".

249
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,255
Scott: And was like, "Oh, well

250
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:23,457
Scott: then.".

251
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:35,320
Rym: Well, we'll see what happens because regardless of the personal stuff with Bulmer, it signals that Microsoft is trying to change some direction towards something different.

252
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,324
Rym: We don't know exactly what.

253
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:41,640
Rym: I'll bet they're going to back off of the Windows 8 direction they've been going.

254
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:42,477
Scott: Probably.

255
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,620
Rym: I'll bet they're going to back off on tablets and I bet they're going to try to do something different.

256
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,039
Scott: I can't really guess what they'll do though.

257
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,559
Scott: I mean, I tried to think like, "Man, if I was like CEO of Sony, I could do so much awesome

258
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:54,800
Scott: shit.".

259
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,189
Scott: But if I was CEO of Microsoft, it's like, "What could I do?

260
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,399
Scott: that would be an obvious move that would make a ton of

261
00:12:59,419 --> 00:12:59,599
Scott: money?".

262
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:03,280
Scott: So make Windows like 20 bucks or 10 bucks.

263
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:12,040
Rym: I would go after making Windows be what it's good at, as in being the desktop operating system for every company in the world.

264
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:12,721
Scott: Obviously.

265
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:16,460
Scott: Well, yeah, but I'm talking about you can't just become the business only, right?

266
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:24,835
Rym: Oh, no, that's the first thing I do because right now there's still the problem of old companies remain using Windows XP to this day for various reasons.

267
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:26,060
Scott: We've talked about that problem before.

268
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,260
Rym: Yeah, I would do something to get them to upgrade.

269
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,282
Scott: Definitely.

270
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:39,340
Scott: But the thing is, you have to keep that business market going and you have to keep working at it to make even more money on it, but you can't abandon the consumer business.

271
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,399
Rym: Well, we know what happens if you do that, BlackBerry.

272
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,667
Scott: IBM.

273
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:42,972
Rym: IBM.

274
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:43,440
Rym: IBM BlackBerry.

275
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:44,083
Scott: Right.

276
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:48,540
Scott: So, you know, it's like, what could I do a Microsoft to get the consumer business back?

277
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:48,941
Scott: Right.

278
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:53,599
Scott: Well, I would make, you know, we do the obvious thing where Xbox games just run on the PC, vice versa.

279
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,440
Rym: Ah, but that's stealing from Peter to pay Paul.

280
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:57,959
Scott: That's not a problem.

281
00:13:58,622 --> 00:13:59,566
Rym: It is for Microsoft.

282
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,120
Rym: As soon as you're cannibalizing part of sales from one side to go after another side.

283
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,406
Scott: The Xbox is such a tiny percent.

284
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:07,180
Scott: Those graphs showing like the amount of revenue for Microsoft.

285
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,945
Scott: The Xbox doesn't even chart.

286
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:09,547
Scott: Right.

287
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,037
Scott: Compared to the other things Microsoft makes money from.

288
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:12,840
Scott: So it doesn't even matter.

289
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:15,628
Scott: You need to increase the pie.

290
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:19,780
Scott: It doesn't matter which, you know, if you sell more Windows is or if you sell more Xbox.

291
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,537
Rym: But simultaneously, they just killed Windows games in a general sense.

292
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:25,320
Rym: Games for Windows Live.

293
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:25,960
Scott: Yeah.

294
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,340
Rym: They haven't replaced it with anything.

295
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,753
Scott: Well, you got to get Xbox One, the actual real Xbox Live.

296
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:32,179
Scott: You have to get on the PC.

297
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:32,856
Rym: Yeah.

298
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:34,063
Scott: Right.

299
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:37,819
Scott: You know, maybe you could, you know, partner with Valve instead of competing with them.

300
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,140
Scott: I don't know.

301
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:51,460
Rym: That is, I believe there are GeekNights episodes from years ago where I said that the real way to win is for Microsoft and Valve to team the fuck up and just have PC gaming and console gaming locked.

302
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:52,841
Scott: Yep.

303
00:14:52,861 --> 00:15:01,780
Scott: And sure, there's something they could do if they actually teamed up and, you know, even if they were like, you know, Valve, look, we'll do whatever is beneficial to make your shit whatever you want.

304
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:11,900
Scott: As long as, you know, the only benefit we're going to get from it is the fact that tons of people are going to want to install the newest Windows or whatever, you know, for 10 bucks, 20 bucks, whatever, you know.

305
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,171
Scott: Office for normal people, 20 bucks.

306
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:16,262
Scott: Business, $1,000.

307
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:16,413
Scott: Yep.

308
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,733
Scott: I guess SQL Server, you're just some guy in your house, free.

309
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:22,680
Scott: You're a company, a million dollars.

310
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,620
Scott: Right.

311
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:24,142
Scott: Same one.

312
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:25,666
Scott: None of these different versions of shit.

313
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:30,297
Scott: with this express and, you know, Visual Studio, oh, you're just some kid, free.

314
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:31,420
Scott: The whole thing for reals.

315
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:33,472
Scott: Oh, you're a company, million dollars.

316
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:34,096
Scott: Right.

317
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:34,759
Scott: That's what I would do.

318
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,209
Rym: You know, Unity does something similar with their licensing.

319
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,520
Rym: Below a certain level, you basically don't have to pay.

320
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,101
Scott: Yep.

321
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:42,086
Scott: But Microsoft does it with.

322
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:45,795
Scott: like all this, you know, this DRM and like, oh, you get Visual Studio Express for free.

323
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:46,978
Scott: It's like, wah wah.

324
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:47,960
Scott: It does not compute.

325
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:48,791
Rym: It works OK.

326
00:15:48,832 --> 00:15:49,198
Scott: I use it.

327
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,163
Scott: Yeah, but it's not.

328
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:54,780
Scott: You know, if you want to do something for reals, it's missing like the one bit you really need.

329
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:57,124
Scott: You know, I'd be like, well, you get the one bit.

330
00:15:57,144 --> 00:16:02,655
Scott: And then if companies try to, you know, use the express one, it's like, well, we'll fucking know.

331
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:03,376
Scott: Right.

332
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:04,398
Scott: And then we'll get you.

333
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,420
Scott: Anyway.

334
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,550
Rym: Anyway, so I got a really brief news here.

335
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,900
Rym: So Chromecast, according to...

336
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:15,999
Scott: That's that thing, the USB, the HDMI thing you plug into your TV.

337
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:16,427
Scott: Yeah.

338
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Scott: It's sort of like an Apple TV for Android, Chrome, whatever.

339
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,722
Rym: You know what it is?

340
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:27,180
Rym: It's one more failed monument to the never ending stream of people who try to make the set top box.

341
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,087
Scott: You know, Google TV?

342
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,200
Scott: What happened to that shit?

343
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,983
Rym: Apple TV.

344
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,832
Rym: It's multiple iterations.

345
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:33,600
Rym: I still don't know anyone who uses Apple TV.

346
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,948
Scott: I know a few people use it, but basically they're people who are like all in on Apple.

347
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:37,991
Scott: Like they buy people.

348
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:41,540
Scott: Anyone who buys TV and movies on iTunes and stuff is using Apple TV.

349
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,999
Scott: Because then what you can do is you sit there with your iPad, you tap on a movie and it plays on your TV.

350
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,377
Rym: Now that is a killer app, having the...

351
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:50,879
Scott: If you're all in on Apple.

352
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:59,180
Rym: Yeah, the multi-device integration of your phone, computer, TV, refrigerator, vibrator, all interact with each other live all the time.

353
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,283
Rym: And you just pass things back and forth.

354
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:04,170
Rym: But, so Google breaks.

355
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,400
Rym: Chromecast's ability to play local content was the headline.

356
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:09,333
Scott: Uh-huh.

357
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:16,319
Rym: The real headline should be journalists don't know how private, unpublished APIs work.

358
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:24,114
Rym: So there is an unpublished non-production API that is being changed.

359
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:27,099
Rym: It's not to be used for production apps for Google Chromecast yet.

360
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:34,620
Rym: And people have made devices, or not really devices, they made software that will stream your local content to Chromecast.

361
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:37,060
Rym: Because everyone has their little NAS.

362
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,880
Scott: The same way that people hack the Apple TV.

363
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:44,760
Rym: Everyone has a NAS with like 100 terabytes of whatever anime they care about or whatever movies they pirated.

364
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,500
Rym: Their entire music collection from when they were in high school, whatever.

365
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,214
Rym: But, uh, that broke.

366
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:51,000
Rym: Again.

367
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,443
Rym: And that was the news.

368
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:56,960
Rym: Like, oh my god, this local streaming thing was broken because Google's trying to lock out local content.

369
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,640
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna quote the TOS.

370
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Rym: Warning, the Google Cast STK is a preview STK intended for development and testing purposes only, not for production apps.

371
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:12,658
Rym: Google may change this STK significantly prior to the official release of Google Cast STK.

372
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:17,200
Scott: The reason you're a tech journalist and not a technologist is because you don't know that much.

373
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,320
Scott: It's the same problem we see in a lot of journalism of specialized areas of interest.

374
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,458
Scott: You know, especially games journalism is that, you know, there's a lot of games journalists out there who are good, but most aren't.

375
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,700
Scott: And most of them, even the ones I say aren't good in general, they're good at writing.

376
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:37,300
Scott: I think most games journalists, most people who their job is games journalism, they're great.

377
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,569
Scott: They're way better at writing than me because that's what they do.

378
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,280
Scott: And I read what they write and I'm like, wow, they're not bad at writing.

379
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,233
Scott: But they just don't have the knowledge of games.

380
00:18:45,354 --> 00:18:46,660
Scott: Here's the same thing in the tech industry.

381
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,707
Scott: John Z. Dvorak is a tech journalist.

382
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:49,029
Scott: Why?

383
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:51,340
Scott: Because he can't program his way out of a paper bag.

384
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,640
Scott: I mean, he knows more about technology than, say, some normal people.

385
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,383
Scott: Right on this, you know, whatever.

386
00:18:57,724 --> 00:19:06,180
Scott: But he doesn't know enough to actually have a job as a programmer or someone making hardware or someone making devices or, you know, anything like that.

387
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,804
Scott: That's why he's writing about it.

388
00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:14,920
Scott: He knows enough and he knows enough about writing that he can write about the technology, you know, and other tech journalists are the same way.

389
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,202
Scott: Same as this person.

390
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:18,489
Scott: They don't understand technology enough.

391
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:19,412
Scott: Right.

392
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:20,615
Scott: So but they can.

393
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:22,300
Scott: they know more than the average person.

394
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,768
Scott: So they can write technology articles for normal people.

395
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:28,620
Scott: But then any actual tech people, if they look at it, will say, what the fuck is wrong with you?

396
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:37,160
Rym: Now, in this case, the developer of cyanogen mod said that keeps saying that Google is intentionally breaking his apps.

397
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,410
Scott: Well, that guy's just a crazy nut.

398
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:40,640
Rym: Let's see.

399
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,262
Rym: Heads up.

400
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:45,040
Rym: Google's latest Chromecast update intentionally in italics breaks all cast.

401
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,180
Rym: They disabled video underscore playback support from the Chromecast application.

402
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:55,500
Rym: Given this is the second time this purposely removed disabled the ability to play media from external sources confers my suspicions that blah, blah, blah, blah.

403
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,099
Rym: Now, I will just say this and we can move on.

404
00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:09,220
Rym: I would not put it past Google to lock out content to some degree in the final version of this, because Google does have a lot of vested corporate interest in this stuff.

405
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:13,660
Rym: But we don't have evidence that that is what is happening yet.

406
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,580
Scott: You know, that's what I would do to bring it around.

407
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,535
Scott: If I was CEO of Microsoft is I would do all the fuck you moves.

408
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:21,820
Scott: I'd be like, yeah, Windows Phone.

409
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,080
Scott: If you both have Windows phones, you can literally simply just transfer fucking MP3s from one phone to another.

410
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:28,582
Rym: Yep.

411
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:29,267
Scott: Just boom.

412
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,200
Scott: Fuck you music content producers.

413
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:41,800
Scott: If you if you run Microsoft, Microsoft, if you run Microsoft Windows and your friend also runs Microsoft Windows, it's easy as balls just to send files back and forth any file you want.

414
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,807
Scott: Well, you don't even give a shit.

415
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,699
Scott: In fact, super encrypted, too.

416
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,500
Scott: Oh, and when the government comes and says you want to put back doors in, I'll say that was the old Ballmer Microsoft.

417
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,345
Scott: We've taken all the back doors out.

418
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:56,840
Scott: We're even patching all back to XP to remove those black hole, those back doors.

419
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:57,519
Scott: Now, now, now, now.

420
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,151
Scott: Fuck you, government.

421
00:20:58,212 --> 00:20:58,599
Scott: Fuck you.

422
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,379
Rym: Here's the problem with the security side, because...

423
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,200
Scott: And that I'd advertise the fuck that I'm doing that.

424
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:03,640
Rym: Yeah.

425
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:11,780
Rym: And I would simultaneously go to the government and say, look, we're going to fucking open ourselves the fuck up and bend over to you because all the people who care about security are going to buy Windows.

426
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:16,338
Scott: Well, I would also be like...

427
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,686
Rym: That's the one benefit of open source for security.

428
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:23,440
Rym: is that some nerd is going to find the back door if there's any back door in open source code.

429
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:23,901
Scott: That's true.

430
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:28,299
Scott: No, but it's like if Microsoft does stuff like that, where it's like... Yeah, that's why I said before.

431
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,499
Rym: Yeah, we're taking all the DRM out.

432
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,492
Rym: Microsoft and Valve, Microsoft should be the one that make the set top box.

433
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,960
Rym: Windows on the TV should be the default.

434
00:21:36,622 --> 00:21:38,720
Scott: It was, but they couldn't really make it work.

435
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,210
Scott: They almost had it.

436
00:21:40,251 --> 00:21:41,260
Scott: I'd go back to that, too.

437
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,160
Scott: The thing is, the Xbox just plays any fucking video in the universe.

438
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:46,571
Scott: It's got all the codecs.

439
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:47,560
Scott: We keep them all up to date.

440
00:21:47,902 --> 00:21:48,667
Scott: It's just perfect.

441
00:21:48,728 --> 00:21:49,352
Scott: It just works.

442
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,540
Scott: No fancy weird setups.

443
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,395
Scott: Just any video fucking file.

444
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:52,920
Scott: No hacks.

445
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,400
Scott: Yeah.

446
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:58,420
Scott: If anyone ever has to hack a Microsoft thing, then that means the CEO of Microsoft didn't do this strategy.

447
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:05,740
Scott: The strategy would be you never need to hack our shit because we, our developers here made everything so perfect that it's already the way you want.

448
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,360
Scott: Super free to watch all the videos and share all the files and do all the things.

449
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:16,611
Scott: So, what's interesting is I basically- Oh, and Xbox Gold would be, there wouldn't even be gold.

450
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:19,100
Scott: It would just be everyone has free Xbox Live accounts.

451
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,760
Rym: I would sell Platinum, though.

452
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,122
Scott: Yeah, okay.

453
00:22:22,143 --> 00:22:24,800
Scott: Maybe you could have a Platinum for money that does even more crazy shit.

454
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,260
Rym: Copper, Gold, Silver, Platinum, Ultra Platinum.

455
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:27,911
Scott: I don't think so.

456
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:28,758
Scott: Just- Chromium.

457
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,091
Scott: It would be more like Amazon Prime, right?

458
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:32,720
Scott: Where it's just Amazon and Amazon Prime.

459
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:37,260
Scott: But there wouldn't be any, you'd only need Platinum if you were like super hardcore.

460
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:41,540
Scott: Normal people, they could watch their Netflix and use the Twitters and all that without paying for the Platinum.

461
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:51,260
Rym: Anyway, I don't really pay attention to the news on these things because I'm one of those people who just has a real computer running a desktop OS connected to my TV.

462
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,017
Scott: Yeah, me too.

463
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,777
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

464
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:02,446
Rym: I watched the first season and a half of Breaking Bad.

465
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,289
Rym: It was pretty good.

466
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:03,670
Rym: I like it.

467
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,830
Rym: Not as good as House of Cards or Adventure Time or any of these other things, but it's pretty good.

468
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:14,570
Rym: I kind of stopped watching and I kind of want to watch the new season just because people are talking about it and it looks good.

469
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:26,110
Rym: So here, for you, in case you want to do the same thing and are in a similar boat, is a super spoilers for obvious reasons, really good recap of the first five seasons of Breaking Bad.

470
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,110
Scott: How long does it take to watch it?

471
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,880
Scott: 27 minutes.

472
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,018
Scott: Well, that show is pretty slow then, isn't it?

473
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:32,423
Scott: There's a lot of filler.

474
00:23:32,924 --> 00:23:34,650
Scott: You can watch five seasons in 20 minutes.

475
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:40,450
Rym: The show does have a lot of... I wouldn't call it filler, but it's more like there's a lot of atmosphere.

476
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,030
Scott: Quiet scenes with cicadas chirping?

477
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:42,368
Rym: Yeah.

478
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:42,841
Rym: Yeah.

479
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,530
Rym: Which actually is super... I mean, if you call that...

480
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,270
Scott: I like those, yeah.

481
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,874
Rym: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

482
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:48,350
Rym: If you call that filler in Ava, like, all right.

483
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,690
Scott: I'm not saying I like those.

484
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:52,005
Rym: Imagine the no cicada Ava cut.

485
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:52,650
Rym: That would be awful.

486
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:53,896
Rym: Wait a minute.

487
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:54,300
Rym: Wait a minute.

488
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,230
Rym: I want to make the only cicadas cut.

489
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,370
Scott: You'd have to watch it in slow-mo because, like, what just happened?

490
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,910
Scott: When the cicadas are chirping, that's where you try to figure out what you just saw.

491
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:02,361
Rym: You know what we could do after we finish.

492
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:03,469
Rym: GeekNights Presents Utena?

493
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,390
Rym: GeekNights Presents Ava, and then because we're doing it anyway, I could make a super cut of every cicada.

494
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,791
Scott: Yeah.

495
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:09,213
Scott: You know what?

496
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:11,670
Scott: Every time cicadas chirped in Ava, you know what my brain thought?

497
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,020
Scott: Huh?

498
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:13,576
Scott: Oh, right.

499
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:15,530
Scott: No one can have any babies on all of Earth.

500
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,671
Scott: Oh, because the room of... Oh, or, oh, right, everyone... Yeah.

501
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,277
Scott: Or, oh, right, everyone left.

502
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:24,570
Scott: There's no one left in this town except, like, these tender people, and that's it.

503
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:25,490
Scott: Everyone's gone.

504
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:29,029
Scott: Or, oh, right, they moved the whole city underground and kept it there.

505
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:29,430
Scott: Yeah.

506
00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:33,370
Scott: Or, oh, right, that was all I thought every time that it was cicadas chirping.

507
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,146
Rym: Anyway, Breaking Bad, the first five seasons in 27 minutes.

508
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:36,850
Rym: Super well done.

509
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:53,389
Rym: The only thing I want to point out is that there's a character who... There are so many scenes, if you watch this, in the later seasons, where a particular character holds a gun to another character's head and says, "Give me a reason not to fucking shoot you," and the guy's like, "Just hear me out, just hear me out, just hear me

510
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:53,470
Rym: out.".

511
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,410
Scott: That happens over and over again?

512
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:54,692
Scott: Yeah.

513
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:56,589
Rym: You know what the moral of this recap is?

514
00:24:56,853 --> 00:24:58,048
Rym: He should have just fucking shot him.

515
00:24:58,955 --> 00:24:59,780
Rym: The first time.

516
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:01,350
Scott: Anyway.

517
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,297
Scott: Anyway, so, thing of the day.

518
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:13,389
Scott: There's this dude named Martin Manley, and he wasn't really, you know, he was a very interesting person, and what he did is he killed himself.

519
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,370
Rym: Oh, this guy was all over Fark.

520
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:16,827
Scott: Yeah.

521
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,310
Rym: And there's also a story because this web provider shut his website down at first.

522
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:28,110
Scott: Yeah, that's right, but the thing is, is he wasn't really crazy, at least not super crazy, like, you know, or super depressed or anything like that.

523
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:40,810
Scott: I'm sure he wasn't perfect because he killed himself, but, you know, he was an intelligent, well-spoken person, and, you know, he killed himself for reasons, his own reasons, and everyone has their own reasons, and he has a right to those reasons.

524
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:46,730
Scott: The interesting thing is that before killing himself, he wrote this huge website explaining the hell out of everything.

525
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,850
Scott: You know, a lot of people, they explain things when they kill themselves.

526
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:52,050
Scott: They leave behind a note or something of that nature.

527
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:57,230
Scott: They make a Facebook post or Twitter or something, but, you know, usually you don't get to see that.

528
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,770
Scott: It's like if the family has a suicide note, it's like no one sees that, right?

529
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:18,889
Scott: So people who haven't, you know, collected a suicide note in their lives, or were, you know, lucky enough, such as we are, to not collect a suicide note in their lives, right, don't really know what's going through some of those people's heads, and a lot of those people are crazy or depressed, so even if you had the note, you know, it wouldn't really make a lot of sense to you.

530
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:21,550
Scott: But here it's just really, really interesting.

531
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:36,550
Scott: This is, you know, I'm sure there are other cases, but this is the first widely published, you know, case, where a guy wrote this huge website, and you can read and really see what he was thinking and, you know, what was going through his head and why he decided to kill himself and whatnot.

532
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:41,206
Rym: I remember there was one point I was poking around through it, and there was a bit that was like 9/11 conspiracies.

533
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:42,329
Rym: I was like, uh-oh.

534
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:46,209
Rym: But then I clicked on that part, and he was basically like, yeah, you're all morons.

535
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:48,763
Rym: It wasn't a conspiracy.

536
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:49,350
Rym: Calm down.

537
00:26:51,032 --> 00:27:05,810
Scott: But yeah, this is definitely worthwhile reading, simply to, you know, look inside the mind of another human being who had nothing really to hide because they were dead, and maybe learn something about yourself from the death of this other person.

538
00:27:07,654 --> 00:27:12,470
Rym: I feel like I have a very complicated position on the rights of the dead.

539
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,189
Scott: Yeah, that's the website.

540
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:18,070
Rym: Yes, because on--well, it was taken down by Yahoo, so this is-- Oh, the guy also donated his organs and stuff.

541
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:25,470
Rym: Yeah, but he even set it up to where police would find his body so no one would be traumatized, and he set it up to where they'd find it right away.

542
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,269
Scott: Yeah, see, look how not crazy he was.

543
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:27,804
Rym: Yeah.

544
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,342
Scott: He thought all of this out.

545
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,790
Rym: Yeah, he put it really down.

546
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,330
Scott: It's like he decided long in advance.

547
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:42,270
Scott: It's sort of like, you know, he wasn't ill, this guy, but it was similar to like Terry Pratchett wants to, you know, because he has Alzheimer's.

548
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,750
Scott: This guy, I don't think, had Alzheimer's.

549
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:54,490
Rym: So on one hand, I feel like the dead should have no rights to things that they might have wanted because they're gone, but I also feel like-- It's like you're dead, whatever you want, it doesn't matter anymore.

550
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:01,390
Rym: But I also feel like certain kinds of wishes should be maintained, especially if they paid for them in advance, like this website.

551
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:10,170
Scott: Well, I mean, if I pay someone for services, like I sign a contract with someone that says like, "After I die, you will jump up and down ten times," it's like that contract is still binding.

552
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:10,770
Scott: I paid you.

553
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,270
Rym: But at least it's binding to the estate.

554
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:20,110
Scott: Yeah, right, like if I bought a piano, right, and the piano was going to be delivered tomorrow and I die today, they still got to deliver that fucking piano tomorrow.

555
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,301
Scott: They can't just be like, "Oh, he died.

556
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:22,128
Scott: We don't have to deliver it

557
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:22,310
Scott: now.".

558
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:23,890
Scott: You got the money, right?

559
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:26,150
Scott: You give the money back or you deliver the piano.

560
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,510
Scott: It was paid for just because the person you paid for is dead, right?

561
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:30,109
Scott: That kind of thing needs to stay.

562
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:36,606
Scott: But it's like if I'm dead and I just write in my will that I want someone to do something, it's like, "You don't have to fucking do

563
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:36,769
Scott: that.".

564
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,906
Rym: And look at how many people--.

565
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,730
Scott: If they don't want to.

566
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,830
Scott: If they want to, okay.

567
00:28:40,112 --> 00:28:47,089
Rym: Important literary works that were not published where the person who died left instructions to not publish them or tried to hide them and just publish them.

568
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,670
Scott: That's fine.

569
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,750
Rym: Yeah, that's great.

570
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,990
Scott: Funerals are for the people who are still alive.

571
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,850
Scott: They're not for the dead people, right?

572
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:56,250
Scott: All that stuff is for the living people.

573
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:58,210
Scott: Dead people are dead.

574
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,509
Scott: They don't do anything for them.

575
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,690
Rym: Now, I do believe we in the United States should ban burial.

576
00:29:03,192 --> 00:29:05,086
Scott: I also agree, but it's a separate episode.

577
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,409
Rym: It is a separate episode.

578
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:11,910
Rym: So, not this weekend, but oh shit, it actually is this weekend.

579
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:12,889
Rym: It's time.

580
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:15,409
Scott: P motherfucking A to the X.

581
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:17,769
Rym: You actually said to the X.

582
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:18,470
Scott: That's right.

583
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:18,970
Rym: You said that.

584
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,870
Scott: To the X. You said-- Every day hustling.

585
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:23,527
Rym: Okay.

586
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,589
Scott: It is time to hustle.

587
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,050
Rym: So, we're going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo.

588
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,530
Rym: It's a convention about gaming and a webcomic called Penny Arcade.

589
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,309
Rym: It's in Seattle on Friday.

590
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:34,850
Rym: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.

591
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,770
Scott: I'm laughing for a different reason that you don't realize.

592
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,488
Rym: Oh, fuck.

593
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,229
Rym: So, we're going to be there.

594
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,850
Rym: We're going to be presenting on Monday at noon in the Wolfman Theater.

595
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:43,570
Rym: Bad.

596
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:43,858
Scott: Monday?

597
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,470
Scott: Wait, PAX is on Monday?

598
00:29:45,715 --> 00:29:46,389
Scott: Are you shitting me?

599
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,048
Rym: Bad games.

600
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,790
Scott: Oh, you don't need to come to that if it's bad.

601
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,949
Scott: There's plenty of good games at PAX.

602
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,203
Rym: Bad games.

603
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,129
Rym: Bad games.

604
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,390
Rym: I'll let you all in on a secret.

605
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,510
Rym: Yeah, we're going to do a little bit of that angry video game nerd.

606
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,150
Rym: Like, haha, look at this bad game, but it's not what the panel's about.

607
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,230
Scott: Our panel is never about what it says it's going to be about.

608
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,008
Scott: That's what we do.

609
00:30:03,357 --> 00:30:03,487
Scott: Well.

610
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,710
Scott: If you don't know that and you're listening to the show, really?

611
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,470
Scott: I point out, did you just start listening?

612
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,309
Rym: Beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

613
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:10,530
Scott: Have you not watched our panel on YouTube ever?

614
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,250
Rym: Beyond Dungeons and Dragons is about exactly what it says it's about.

615
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,930
Scott: It's not about Dungeons and Dragons at all.

616
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,220
Scott: Yeah, it is.

617
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,989
Rym: It's about how Dungeons and Dragons is bad.

618
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,828
Scott: Yeah, okay, anyway.

619
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:29,930
Rym: But we're also going to be at another event, the pre-Pax Sky High Tabletop Play Benefiting Food Lifeline event in the Columbia Tower Club.

620
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:31,109
Scott: It's a charity dinner.

621
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:34,230
Scott: I'm going to eat dinner on Thursday night in Seattle anyway.

622
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,606
Scott: Why not have the money I would have spent on dinner at a restaurant?

623
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:38,330
Scott: go to charity?

624
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:42,241
Scott: And, side benefit, good gaming tables.

625
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:44,890
Scott: I don't have to fight over for a whole night of pre-Pax.

626
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:48,050
Scott: Usually you have to fight in like the Sheraton lobby for a tiny shit table.

627
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,470
Scott: This is, oh, along with dinner?

628
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:55,310
Scott: I can then play games on these super nice tables in comfort without having to fight for them?

629
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,810
Scott: Yes, I will gladly pay money for that service.

630
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,149
Scott: Oh, the money goes to charity, you say?

631
00:31:00,634 --> 00:31:02,270
Scott: What is bad about this situation?

632
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,410
Rym: We will be VIPs at the event.

633
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,370
Rym: We will be running and teaching some games for people at the event.

634
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:16,949
Rym: So if you go to this thing, we might teach you how to play Agricola or Glory to Rome and then maybe play a game with you.

635
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:17,710
Rym: Fuck you Rome.

636
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:21,330
Rym: We might run some Burning Wheel or some Inspectors.

637
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,730
Scott: We'll play whatever games are going to be played because it's just a game night.

638
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,690
Rym: We might run a big action castle for all the people.

639
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,110
Scott: If someone else plays Netrunner, we'll just play Netrunner all the time.

640
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,677
Scott: Well, at least I will.

641
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:30,649
Scott: Because that's what I do.

642
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,030
Rym: I feel like we should run a big action castle with everyone there.

643
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,539
Scott: We'll see what the people are doing there.

644
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,023
Scott: It's a dinner.

645
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:35,989
Scott: People do what they do.

646
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,830
Rym: Well, it's a dinner and drinks and hanging out.

647
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,691
Rym: Now kids, you gotta be 21.

648
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:41,130
Scott: That's a problem.

649
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,390
Rym: And also, read the FAQ.

650
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,230
Scott: There's a dress code also.

651
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,570
Rym: You have to dress not like a hobo.

652
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,670
Scott: I think it was like jeans and a shirt is like enough.

653
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,510
Rym: Well, there's two levels.

654
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:57,710
Rym: I think we only have to make it to the first level because the club room, there's like two levels in the FAQ from the tower itself.

655
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:01,045
Rym: And the second tier said, "Gentlemen must be wearing a

656
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:01,427
Rym: jacket.".

657
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:03,510
Scott: Okay, I don't think we have to wear a jacket.

658
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,650
Rym: I don't think so, but I'll have a jacket with me anyway just in case.

659
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,749
Scott: Does that mean I have to bring a jacket?

660
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:07,636
Rym: I don't know.

661
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:08,570
Rym: I'll bring a jacket anyway.

662
00:32:08,671 --> 00:32:09,670
Rym: I always bring a jacket to PAX.

663
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,150
Rym: I bring that awful seersucker that I wear everywhere.

664
00:32:12,192 --> 00:32:12,547
Scott: I only have one.

665
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:13,555
Scott: Really?

666
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:16,992
Rym: I have like 11.

667
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:18,202
Rym: The Book Club book is Stazzyland.

668
00:32:18,242 --> 00:32:19,029
Rym: You should read it.

669
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:20,945
Scott: I finally just got a copy of it.

670
00:32:20,985 --> 00:32:21,410
Scott: Borrowing.

671
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:22,348
Scott: I finished it.

672
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,390
Scott: I'll read it on this plane to Seattle maybe.

673
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:26,642
Scott: Ooh, there's a map of Germany.

674
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,070
Scott: East Berlin, West Berlin.

675
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:28,989
Scott: I've seen that map.

676
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,789
Rym: Yeah, you're gonna learn a lot about that map.

677
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,202
Scott: Huh, Brandenburg Gate.

678
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:32,909
Scott: What is that?

679
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:34,529
Rym: Yeah, Alexander Platz.

680
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:35,664
Rym: Platz.

681
00:32:36,271 --> 00:32:36,703
Scott: What's Platz?

682
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,370
Scott: This reminds me of a James Bond movie that involved a circus and a nuclear bomb.

683
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:45,050
Rym: Gambling.

684
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,123
Scott: Gambling.

685
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:46,730
Scott: Gambling.

686
00:32:47,371 --> 00:32:48,310
Scott: Roll them bones.

687
00:32:48,975 --> 00:32:50,230
Rym: I don't really gamble anymore.

688
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:52,770
Scott: I gamble almost zero.

689
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:53,549
Scott: There was a time.

690
00:32:54,192 --> 00:33:01,550
Rym: There was a time when Scott and I were in Wildwood and we went up the state a little bit to Atlantic City.

691
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,710
Rym: We walked into the roulette table and we just kept betting on red.

692
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,370
Rym: And we walked out, each with a couple hundred bucks.

693
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,710
Scott: I bet on a few other things randomly.

694
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:10,250
Rym: I pretty much just bet on red.

695
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:13,490
Rym: Once I bet on the one-third bet instead of the one-half bet.

696
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:16,109
Rym: You can bet on like one-third of the board.

697
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:25,450
Rym: But pretty much for as long as the internet's been going on, people have been trying to gamble over it because local laws often ban gambling.

698
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:28,310
Rym: And the internet is very difficult to regulate.

699
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:32,070
Scott: I mean, I'm of the opinion if you want to gamble, go ahead.

700
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:37,350
Scott: But also, hey, the way gambling is set up basically is just a regressive tax.

701
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,790
Scott: It takes money away from poor, not smart people and gives it to rich people.

702
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:50,387
Rym: So in the very least, I'm okay with regulation on gambling to ensure that if someone allows gambling, that the gambling is itself fair and what it says it is.

703
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:56,250
Rym: I mean, if I run a casino and the slot machines just never pay out, yeah, jail for me.

704
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:56,644
Scott: Yeah.

705
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,330
Scott: That's fine.

706
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:06,890
Scott: And this is the thing with internet gambling is that you'll see, you know, by forcing it underground, by making it illegal, how can I trust those places are not totally shady and just cheating me?

707
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:07,587
Scott: I can't.

708
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:12,070
Scott: So even if I wanted to gamble, which I don't, I can't because I don't trust that shit.

709
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:19,590
Scott: But if they allowed it, then I could go to places that were above board and regulated and I could trust that I wasn't getting screwed.

710
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,989
Scott: But think about this.

711
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,969
Scott: Let's say we're playing video poker, right?

712
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,708
Scott: Blackjack, you and me.

713
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:25,246
Scott: All right.

714
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:26,181
Scott: You're in your house.

715
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:26,889
Scott: I'm in my house.

716
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:29,170
Scott: But we're sitting at the same virtual blackjack table.

717
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:29,810
Scott: Okay.

718
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:33,190
Scott: I play some cards.

719
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,170
Scott: You play some cards.

720
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:37,509
Scott: You never really get to see the card that I have faced down.

721
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:38,790
Scott: It tells you you lose.

722
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:39,848
Scott: It tells me I lose.

723
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:44,590
Scott: But really, you know, it looks like you won on my screen.

724
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,168
Scott: It looked right.

725
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,510
Scott: It's like they don't have to show us the same damn thing.

726
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,790
Rym: Well, I think poker is a better example that people want to play online poker with other people.

727
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:56,790
Rym: But at the same time, how do you know they're not just bots or not just completely made up?

728
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:57,282
Rym: Yep.

729
00:34:57,731 --> 00:35:01,009
Scott: And people who do play online poker play like a zillion tables at once.

730
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:01,810
Scott: Right.

731
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,490
Scott: And they're doing all this crazy stuff, which is totally unfair.

732
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:06,830
Rym: It's more that those people.

733
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,810
Scott: We can't even stop people from cheating at Counter Strike.

734
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,090
Scott: How are we going to stop people from cheating?

735
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:10,610
Scott: Here's the thing.

736
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:11,833
Rym: There's a lot of.

737
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:15,569
Rym: there's a lot of things we want to try to just talk about the technology of this game.

738
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:15,890
Rym: wise.

739
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:24,070
Rym: The people who play like 10 poker games at the same time are the same said people who play 10 bingo cards at the same time.

740
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,250
Scott: They're just trying to do it for a living so they don't have to get a job.

741
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:27,805
Scott: Yes.

742
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:30,570
Rym: Even though you don't make that much money doing that.

743
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,989
Rym: And also that's really kind of sad.

744
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,069
Rym: And what are you gonna put on your resume?

745
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,549
Rym: I play video poker online every day.

746
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:37,290
Rym: Ten video pokers.

747
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:41,350
Rym: I can play 10 video pokers simultaneously.

748
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:51,370
Rym: But beyond all that, you know, you were saying the problem with online gambling or gambling in general is that, you know, basically it's a regressive tax on poor people.

749
00:35:52,150 --> 00:36:04,350
Rym: But if we let it happen online, then we reduce the one benefit that institutionalized gambling has that you push it into certain sort of syntax areas like Las Vegas.

750
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:06,814
Rym: And those are the places in quotes.

751
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:18,290
Rym: people go to do their gambling, get their gamble on, and you can milk the economic benefit more directly and maybe even intervene in the people's lives who are doing it improperly or to their own detriment more easily.

752
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,955
Scott: It also actually might help those areas.

753
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:26,590
Scott: Like if you hurt the Vegas casinos, maybe Vegas will just be awesome shows and get rid of the casinos or have less of them.

754
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,370
Rym: But if gambling happens everywhere, no one's going to Atlantic City.

755
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,610
Scott: Yeah, Atlantic City will just get worse.

756
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,070
Rym: Except all those people who want to buy all you can eat crab legs.

757
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,358
Scott: I read a thing today that said like in the United States, I mean, Internet isn't fast or cheap in the

758
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:38,739
Scott: U.S.,

759
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:44,970
Scott: but it was like, yeah, there's only like two a very like a single digit percentage of people who can't get Internet in the U.S

760
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,253
Rym: I read that 20 percent

761
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:50,963
Scott: of Americans, 20 percent don't, even though they could write, they could get it.

762
00:36:51,023 --> 00:36:52,185
Scott: They choose not to.

763
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:54,450
Scott: And those people are basically the problem.

764
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:00,450
Rym: Did you see the follow up that the majority of those people and they least they're old and poor?

765
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,600
Rym: Nope.

766
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:02,550
Rym: Former Confederacy.

767
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,669
Scott: Also that.

768
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,290
Rym: Former Confederacy lines up directly with the states that have the least percent of Internet use.

769
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:08,931
Scott: Yep.

770
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:13,748
Scott: But the people who are not getting the Internet are basically the old, the poor, the uneducated, etc.

771
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:21,570
Rym: So in a way, maybe it would be fine because the people who are sitting in the slot machines all day are not the people who know they can use a computer.

772
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,110
Scott: And hopefully they wouldn't use a computer even if they could.

773
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:34,930
Rym: And hopefully the old, lonely people who do it because they have nothing else to do, by the time our generation gets that old, more of us will have a few old friends left thanks to Facebook and we'll go live somewhere in person.

774
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:41,070
Scott: But what if having online gaming legal might get the old, uneducated, poor people onto the Internet?

775
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:48,610
Scott: They might learn something while they're there the same way that guy who comes to PAX just for League of Legends might learn something while he's there about another game.

776
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,750
Rym: Online gambling is mostly illegal.

777
00:37:51,414 --> 00:37:52,130
Scott: In the United States.

778
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,176
Scott: Yes.

779
00:37:53,196 --> 00:37:55,350
Rym: So how are so many people doing it anyway?

780
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:03,530
Scott: They just like VPN to some other country where it's legal, get a bank account in like another country, a credit card from another country, use bitcoins, turn them into some other currency.

781
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,550
Rym: Notice how technological measures, this is the beauty of the Internet and the beauty of free speech.

782
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:13,340
Rym: The fact that the Internet is so decentralized means that online gambling sites appeared outside of the U.S.

783
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:16,426
Rym: that were perfectly legal where they were and the U.S.

784
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:18,250
Rym: couldn't do fuck all about it.

785
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:18,611
Scott: Yeah.

786
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:21,759
Scott: All they can do to you if you start trying to gamble is the like, oh, you're using a U.S.

787
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,962
Scott: credit card for online gambling.

788
00:38:23,283 --> 00:38:26,030
Scott: We're just going to shut that down and freeze your bank account and whatever.

789
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:27,229
Scott: Because that's in the U.S.

790
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,475
Scott: They have to go after the like legal side routes.

791
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,196
Rym: They have to Al Capone you to take it down.

792
00:38:34,236 --> 00:38:38,670
Rym: because technologically I have an SSL connection to an IP address.

793
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:41,049
Rym: There are many like it, but this one is mine.

794
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:47,708
Scott: I'm using the VPN, a non 103 from that VPN is connecting and playing video poker.

795
00:38:47,748 --> 00:38:48,430
Scott: Who the hell is it?

796
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,110
Scott: What account is being used to play that video poker site?

797
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:53,756
Scott: It's a British bank account.

798
00:38:54,118 --> 00:38:57,150
Scott: that could be a Britain person using the VPN and doing that.

799
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,650
Scott: It could be a Chinese person.

800
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,350
Scott: Now, we have no clue at the same time.

801
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,510
Rym: They still will go after you with legal means, like, well, if they know that it's me, how would they know?

802
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:08,468
Scott: The only way they can know when I transfer money from that account to my U.S.

803
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:08,830
Scott: account.

804
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,730
Rym: Yes, repatriating the money, money laundering.

805
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,409
Scott: There's an easier way to deal with that.

806
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:19,810
Rym: Buy bitcoins with the money from the account, transfer them to another account and then transfer them to cash.

807
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,809
Scott: Well, that could work, yes.

808
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,330
Scott: But another way to do it would be to just don't transfer it to the U.S.

809
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,670
Scott: Go to Britain on holiday and then, you know, use the money for your vacation.

810
00:39:30,272 --> 00:39:31,270
Rym: That's not a bad idea.

811
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,930
Rym: But then again, Britain is not the best example because they might have.

812
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:34,980
Scott: They have tons of gambling.

813
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,050
Scott: They're just like Australia.

814
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:36,333
Scott: Yep.

815
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:37,850
Rym: Oh my God, Australia.

816
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:44,870
Scott: I watch like some illegal, you know, streams of sports because basically some guy in the UK pays a bunch of money to get a dish.

817
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:49,343
Scott: So he gets the football game and then he streams the football game back to people in the U.S.

818
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:51,710
Scott: over the, you know, Internet's.

819
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:58,548
Scott: And the commercials during like American football in Britain are all like, you know, bet on games.

820
00:39:58,608 --> 00:39:59,250
Scott: Holy shit.

821
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,870
Scott: And it's basically you can do all the stuff that you could bet on at that at that footy game from your computer at home.

822
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:15,970
Rym: But anyway, technologically, online gambling has to do the same things that people who want to share child porn or hide information transfer or spy have to do.

823
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:28,610
Rym: You have to make it to where people can use the sites and make financial transactions over them but simultaneously not be easily identifiable by outside people like the government.

824
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,890
Scott: Well, you know that Silk Road site that just sells drugs and sends them by UPS?

825
00:40:32,091 --> 00:40:33,676
Scott: You can only pay them in bitcoins.

826
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:37,830
Scott: Why don't we just open up a casino and you can only get to it if you're on tour?

827
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:43,570
Scott: Why don't we set up a site that is just a casino that's on tour and you can only gamble in bitcoins?

828
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,472
Rym: It's not a bad idea.

829
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:48,370
Scott: I was going to say in general that the problem is we need enough bitcoins to be the house.

830
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:49,932
Rym: Yeah.

831
00:40:50,295 --> 00:40:51,844
Rym: Also, we'd have to run it somewhere with.

832
00:40:51,965 --> 00:40:52,790
Rym: none of this is illegal.

833
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:54,913
Scott: Well, no, it's.

834
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:55,959
Scott: no one would know where it is.

835
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,629
Scott: Just like no one knows where the Silk Road is.

836
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:00,969
Rym: Yeah, but it's probably not in the United States.

837
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,010
Scott: I almost definitely not in the United States.

838
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:03,211
Rym: Exactly.

839
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:03,754
Rym: That's the point.

840
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:05,162
Rym: We couldn't build it here.

841
00:41:05,605 --> 00:41:07,709
Scott: Also, I'll bet the NSA- We just buy servers somewhere else.

842
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,529
Rym: I'll bet the NSA knows exactly where it is.

843
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:10,649
Scott: I don't know about that.

844
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,990
Rym: Because Tor is pretty easy to attack.

845
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,868
Scott: Well, that's because there were some untrust, there were some basically no good people on Tor running bad nodes.

846
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,750
Scott: They got rid of the bad nodes.

847
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:24,810
Rym: All discussions like this, and this is why we keep bringing it up, come down to circle of trust.

848
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:33,830
Rym: No matter how great the encryption in the world you use, if you use Google's SSL certificate, Google can decrypt everything you're sending them.

849
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,171
Scott: Right.

850
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,910
Scott: That's the whole point is I want to communicate with Google and Google only.

851
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:39,885
Scott: Google has my Gmail, I have my Gmail, and no one else.

852
00:41:39,905 --> 00:41:40,750
Scott: That's the goal, right?

853
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:45,430
Scott: But if I can't trust Google, Google can just read my Gmail and send it to anyone they want.

854
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:51,067
Rym: If I want to communicate with just Scott and not Google, we have to use our own encryption scheme.

855
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:52,010
Rym: that's just between us.

856
00:41:52,572 --> 00:41:57,390
Rym: And I have to trust that Scott won't just take all my communication and share it with a bunch of other people.

857
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:03,130
Scott: I could do something like, let's say I have a file that has secrets in it, so I encrypt it, but I store it on my Amazon bucket.

858
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,923
Scott: Well, Amazon has it, but it's encrypted.

859
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:05,750
Scott: They're not going to break that.

860
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,409
Rym: Yup, that's fine.

861
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:11,830
Scott: But I'm basically trusting me and only me, and I can't send that information to anybody.

862
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,370
Scott: And then let's say I share it with Rym, so Rym can decrypt it.

863
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:16,850
Rym: I could also put it on Pirate Bell.

864
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,949
Scott: And then Rym, as soon as he decrypts it, I mean no one else has it.

865
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:26,970
Scott: I was successfully sent a secret message to Rym, but then he just posted it on his Twitter and his Tumblr, and everyone saw it.

866
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,210
Scott: And it's like, well, fuck you Rym.

867
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,750
Scott: It's the same thing with the gambling, right?

868
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,010
Scott: You have to trust the casino isn't cheating.

869
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,590
Scott: You have to trust the people you're playing with aren't cheating.

870
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:41,230
Scott: You have to trust there's no one in between you and the casino taking your monies or fucking up with your game across the internets.

871
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:43,936
Scott: There's so many things you have to trust.

872
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:49,970
Scott: to believe in the online gambling itself is sound, technologically, right?

873
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:54,290
Scott: Even if it was legit and regulated by the government, you still have to trust.

874
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,508
Scott: I mean, Counter Strike, people still cheat at it.

875
00:42:56,837 --> 00:42:56,967
Scott: Yup.

876
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,389
Scott: Even with Valve with their VAC.

877
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,569
Rym: Or people don't cheat and get accused of cheating, like me.

878
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:02,244
Scott: Yeah.

879
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,929
Rym: I got kicked and banned from a server not that long ago.

880
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:10,600
Scott: And if people online gambled like crazy, it's like someone would hit jackpots.

881
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:16,650
Scott: pretty, you know, it's like, yeah, the percentage of people hitting jackpots would be about the same, but the absolute number would go way up.

882
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:26,410
Rym: It kind of delves into non-Monday territory, but I suspect that if you did a huge study of people who gamble online, there's two distinct classes.

883
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:37,770
Rym: There are the people who gamble because it's fun to gamble with friends, maybe for money, like they're doing it for money or whatever, but they're doing it not to make a living, they're doing it because it's fun.

884
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:45,070
Rym: And then there's the much bigger group of people who are doing it to make money or because they think it's easy money.

885
00:43:45,931 --> 00:43:53,226
Scott: And the latter- I know a lot of people, especially college age dudes, basically try to do like online poker as their job.

886
00:43:53,246 --> 00:43:54,930
Scott: They thought they were so good at it or whatever.

887
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:00,160
Rym: Yup, because those sites, I mean, part of the reason they do it is that you start to trust the sites because they do pay out.

888
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:03,967
Rym: They do pay out, but they don't pay out forever.

889
00:44:03,987 --> 00:44:05,830
Rym: They don't pay out all the time.

890
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,758
Rym: In fact, because they're not regulated, they could pay out a lot early on and then not pay out anymore.

891
00:44:12,118 --> 00:44:19,010
Rym: And as long as it takes you longer to figure out it's not paying out anymore, then the time it took you to build up the money you'd gotten, it's a net profit for them.

892
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:19,569
Rym: Yup.

893
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,894
Rym: And it caused them almost nothing to do because the security stuff's pretty easy.

894
00:44:22,914 --> 00:44:25,458
Rym: There's another factor with the circle of trust.

895
00:44:25,898 --> 00:44:30,144
Rym: If I want to gamble online, I have to trust the fuck out of that casino.

896
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,868
Rym: Casino doesn't have to trust me at all.

897
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:34,570
Rym: It's got my money, it could just disappear.

898
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,515
Rym: So it's a one-sided arrangement.

899
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:42,330
Rym: Only one party is hurt by a lack of trust or a failure to uphold trust.

900
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:51,650
Rym: As soon as you're communicating with someone where the other party will be harmed if you break the trust, but you are not harmed if they break the trust, it's very similar to the game theory.

901
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,410
Scott: You're basically relying on them to be nice.

902
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,809
Scott: Please be nice and don't fuck me.

903
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:59,910
Rym: I mean, if I have nukes and you don't, you just have to trust me and not use nukes.

904
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,151
Scott: Anyway, I go into a casino.

905
00:45:01,391 --> 00:45:04,454
Scott: I give them a hundred bucks to give me a hundred dollars in chips, right?

906
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:15,525
Scott: Those chips are only worth anything because basically, effectively, as a libertarian would say, the federal government has a gun to the casino's head that forces them to give me a hundred bucks if I give them the chips.

907
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:19,709
Scott: Otherwise, the casino would just sell chips and be like, "Man, we made a fortune selling chips.

908
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:19,969
Scott: We're

909
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:20,370
Scott: closed.".

910
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:21,051
Rym: Yup.

911
00:45:21,272 --> 00:45:24,590
Rym: One day, you just stop cashing in chips and see how long it takes people to figure it out.

912
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:24,985
Rym: Yup.

913
00:45:25,652 --> 00:45:31,750
Rym: And because it's a libertarian world, you buy up all the newspapers first, so the newspapers keep running stories about huge payouts.

914
00:45:35,196 --> 00:45:36,009
Rym: That's a pretty good idea.

915
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,190
Rym: Let's start voting Republican.

916
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:38,966
Scott: Sure.

917
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:48,870
Rym: Anyway, but I'm much more interested in the gambling, the first type of gambling, like salty bet with real dollars.

918
00:45:50,995 --> 00:45:52,169
Rym: That would be kind of fun.

919
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:58,829
Scott: The problem with salty bet is that it's not, uh, I wanted to use it as a thing of the day, but I guess we're talking about it now, right?

920
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,450
Rym: We'll talk about it another time.

921
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:07,130
Scott: Is that, you know, casino games that you see in real casinos or sports or things that have uncertainties, right, where the odds are set, right?

922
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:14,730
Scott: Salty bet is like, well, you can't really, you know, get like a firm, the casino, the house wouldn't always win.

923
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,717
Rym: Well, that's why there's no house.

924
00:46:17,158 --> 00:46:18,986
Rym: The house takes a rake or a cut.

925
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,545
Scott: It's just like- Oh, like poker?

926
00:46:20,565 --> 00:46:20,749
Scott: Yeah.

927
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:21,392
Rym: Like poker.

928
00:46:21,432 --> 00:46:26,750
Rym: That's the interesting kind of gambling where you set up a system where people are gambling with other people.

929
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,235
Rym: You just take a cut.

930
00:46:28,737 --> 00:46:31,890
Rym: Now, you're just, you're the broker of trust.

931
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,910
Rym: Security-wise, it's such an elegant analogy for how to do secure networks.

932
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:46,890
Rym: If you do a game like Texas Hold'em and you want to be the casino, you now have a vested interest in making sure that all the people playing trust you.

933
00:46:47,131 --> 00:46:51,410
Rym: Because if you're, if people stop trusting you, your business disappears.

934
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,869
Rym: Your cut is only from the fact that people trust you.

935
00:46:55,331 --> 00:47:02,510
Rym: So now everyone has an incentive to validate your trust or their trust of you and you have an incentive to maintain that trust.

936
00:47:02,772 --> 00:47:05,770
Rym: And then everybody gets what they want, except the people who lose at poker.

937
00:47:07,414 --> 00:47:08,689
Scott: But I guess in a way they get what they want.

938
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:16,390
Scott: It's like, yeah, we could set up a thing where it's like, you know, it's Counter-Strike and you just bet on actual Counter-Strike games and we don't take any of the money.

939
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:22,630
Scott: You're betting against other people betting on the same Counter-Strike game and the money goes to the winner and we just take a cut for our services.

940
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:32,670
Rym: Now, most gambling in the sad loser sense tends to use point spreads and different mechanisms to pretty much always make the odds even.

941
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:35,054
Rym: Because that's what's best for the house.

942
00:47:35,496 --> 00:47:41,430
Rym: It's not good for casinos or bookies to do the kind of betting that's more fun of who's going to win.

943
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:45,050
Rym: The Oakland Raiders or the Detroit Lions.

944
00:47:45,992 --> 00:47:50,561
Scott: If you look at Salty Bet, you can see a lot of times it's just a fucking foregone conclusion.

945
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,005
Scott: It's like, yeah, waifu vs DBZ.

946
00:47:53,105 --> 00:47:54,368
Scott: Waifu's going to win.

947
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,581
Rym: But that's the kind of betting that Among Friends is a lot more fun.

948
00:47:59,781 --> 00:48:01,406
Rym: You're not going to win that game with El Grande.

949
00:48:01,486 --> 00:48:02,469
Rym: Oh, fuck yes I am.

950
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,529
Scott: I'll bet on myself.

951
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,430
Scott: Because you're betting on skill, you're not betting on chance.

952
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:07,352
Rym: Exactly.

953
00:48:07,614 --> 00:48:09,110
Rym: That's more fun kind of betting.

954
00:48:09,812 --> 00:48:10,433
Scott: But here's the thing.

955
00:48:10,473 --> 00:48:13,681
Scott: With computers, with skill, it's sort of known.

956
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:17,210
Scott: You can know what people's skills are or you can look up the skill.

957
00:48:17,991 --> 00:48:18,578
Scott: When you bet on...

958
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:21,449
Rym: Whatcha doing there with your boom?

959
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:21,995
Scott: I don't know.

960
00:48:22,016 --> 00:48:22,850
Scott: Weird stuff just happened.

961
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,415
Scott: You think about horse betting.

962
00:48:26,177 --> 00:48:29,427
Scott: They know which horse is better because they read a horsey newspaper.

963
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:29,888
Scott: Maybe.

964
00:48:30,169 --> 00:48:30,510
Scott: Maybe.

965
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,710
Rym: You know which horse is better because the odds are so meticulously done.

966
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:39,585
Scott: Yes, but if you go on the internets to bet on something of skill, you can look up so much information on the internet.

967
00:48:39,606 --> 00:48:41,270
Scott: You know exactly what the fuck's going to happen.

968
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,592
Scott: There's no secrets.

969
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:50,270
Scott: And if you bet on something of chance, well, now we've got issues because in the real world of gambling, you've got a roulette wheel.

970
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,795
Scott: No one knows where that ball's fucking going.

971
00:48:53,076 --> 00:48:56,785
Scott: But with a computer, you've got a hardware random number generator.

972
00:48:56,845 --> 00:48:58,109
Scott: Is it a block of cesium?

973
00:48:58,129 --> 00:48:58,590
Scott: What do you have?

974
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,026
Scott: You have a block of cesium for every virtual roulette table?

975
00:49:02,046 --> 00:49:02,510
Scott: What are you using?

976
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,195
Scott: I can totally fuck with that.

977
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:14,130
Scott: Even if your casino was legit, the integrity of the game itself is under question because it is in software.

978
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:26,390
Rym: But at least if it's regulated and tested, then the incentive is entirely on the house to maintain its integrity and odds because if it doesn't, people are going to win more often.

979
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:27,893
Scott: And that could be me.

980
00:49:28,954 --> 00:49:31,900
Scott: But that's the psychology.

981
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,426
Rym: People in college keep trying to play online poker.

982
00:49:35,446 --> 00:49:37,269
Rym: They feel like, "I can game the system and

983
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:37,550
Rym: win.".

984
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,233
Scott: Well, I mean, it's happened.

985
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:41,078
Scott: Counting cards and blackjack, same thing.

986
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:46,330
Scott: We'll just see another thing like that when people are counting and figuring out random number generators.

987
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:51,990
Rym: But casinos love people who try to count cards because those people usually fuck up and lose more money than they win.

988
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,799
Scott: Right, but what if a computer does it for you?

989
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,010
Scott: All you gotta do is have casino script kiddies.

990
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:02,849
Rym: Well, notice how some casinos have single-shoe blackjack where there's just one deck of cards and they act like, "Oh, look, if you want to count cards...".

991
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,306
Rym: People think, "Oh, it's one

992
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:05,569
Rym: deck.".

993
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,786
Scott: If you actually count cards, they kick you out and if you fail, they go,

994
00:50:08,866 --> 00:50:08,947
Scott: "Huh?".

995
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:22,770
Rym: The tables that have single-card or single-deck or single-shoe or whatever they're going to call it usually have slight other changes to the rules related to blackjacks to where the payouts are actually less even if you do count cards.

996
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,711
Rym: But I digress.

997
00:50:26,093 --> 00:50:40,036
Rym: Really, it's just that online gambling is in every sense a perfect example of how trust networks and encryption and security and all these things in other areas of computing apply to the real world.

998
00:50:40,076 --> 00:50:44,510
Rym: It's a real-world example of these things that's really easy for people to understand and analyze.

999
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:57,710
Scott: And if you solve those problems, those solutions will be very applicable to other things and they'll be very worthwhile in finance or any other kind of computer security networking areas.

1000
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:10,310
Rym: The solution that verifiably lets me and Scott and all our friends bet on things in a way where we can't renege and we can't cheat can be used to do allocations in the stock market just as easily or even a stock market itself.

1001
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,930
Scott: Which is why anyone who could do that is just doing the stock market to begin with.

1002
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:15,770
Rym: Why do you think I work for the stock market?

1003
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,490
Scott: It's where most of the money is because that's where the bank... It's like you say the banks are where the money is.

1004
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:24,300
Scott: Yeah, it's like my favorite joke is always like, "Oh, you should work for the bank.

1005
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,862
Scott: That's where the money

1006
00:51:24,922 --> 00:51:24,962
Scott: is.".

1007
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:27,310
Scott: It's like, "Well, no, actually, the banks just put all their money in the stock

1008
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:27,450
Scott: market.".

1009
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,190
Rym: Scott, you should work for Grant's tomb.

1010
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:31,268
Scott: Yeah, that's where Grant is.

1011
00:51:31,995 --> 00:51:32,489
Rym: All the Grants.

1012
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:33,334
Rym: All the Grants.

1013
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:35,346
Scott: I don't need any Grants, though.

1014
00:51:35,366 --> 00:51:35,970
Scott: But if I do...

1015
00:51:36,252 --> 00:51:37,970
Rym: I will take as many Grants as you've got.

1016
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:38,973
Scott: I got two.

1017
00:51:39,335 --> 00:51:40,541
Scott: One and his wife.

1018
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:42,170
Scott: That's the two I got.

1019
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,109
Rym: Alright, I think we're good.

1020
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:51,517
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1021
00:51:51,557 --> 00:51:56,550
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1022
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:01,950
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1023
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:04,878
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1024
00:52:05,018 --> 00:52:09,130
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1025
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:13,146
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1026
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:17,501
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1027
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:20,570
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
