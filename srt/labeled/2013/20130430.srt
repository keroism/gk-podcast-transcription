00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,447
Rym: It's Tuesday April 30th 2013.

2
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:15,200
Rym: I'm rib, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:18,140
Rym: Monaco what's yours is mine.

4
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:21,876
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:25,785
Rym: Aka the game.

6
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:32,773
Scott: We've been talking about since 2010 a game We already did an episode on when he interviewed the guy who made the game the game.

7
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:50,039
Rym: I have a bag of cut Sort of Jimmy cubic zirconias from Andy Schatz because we used our packs guest speaker privileges that we no longer get because they don't give that to people like they used to to get into the expo hall early And play Monaco and we won.

8
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,468
Rym: We interviewed Andy Schatz on GeekNights.

9
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,153
Rym: We got the game early.

10
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:57,000
Scott: I wonder if we think this game is any good.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,807
Rym: Yeah, Monaco sucks.

12
00:00:57,848 --> 00:00:58,393
Rym: Don't play it.

13
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:10,196
Rym: So, uh on the way to work today I was biking, you know biking to work like I do And I'm riding in the car lane because there's only one car lane and there's nowhere else to go.

14
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:11,260
Rym: cuz I'm there's no bike.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,150
Scott: Let's treat me this Manhattan Avenue.

16
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:15,724
Scott: Okay in Brooklyn in BK There's a.

17
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:20,740
Rym: it's basically a two-way street and then there's four lanes But two of them are parking lanes the van parked in the parking lane.

18
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:23,180
Rym: So I take the main lane and it's not much traffic.

19
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:27,420
Rym: This old man and a big old old man car pulls up behind me and starts honking.

20
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,010
Rym: Mmm, I flip them off immediately because that's just what you do.

21
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:36,499
Rym: I mean, I'm not getting I'm not gonna stop and let you pass me Already going like 28 miles an hour so you can you can cool it.

22
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:44,679
Rym: so then he honks and starts yelling something and pulls into oncoming traffic and Pulls up next to me and starts trying to yell at me.

23
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:48,359
Rym: so I look at him and I just flip him off and just keep going.

24
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:51,492
Rym: and He like starts to get really mad.

25
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,203
Rym: and before anything can happen a cop Pulls him over.

26
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:58,274
Rym: nice and I just kept going and I'm pretty sure he got a ticket the best.

27
00:01:58,495 --> 00:01:59,658
Rym: I was very happy with that.

28
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:01,786
Scott: So that was my morning.

29
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:04,039
Scott: it would have been more exciting though if someone hit him head-on.

30
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:09,699
Rym: Perhaps another angry old that would have been exciting would have been less satisfying to me.

31
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,550
Scott: I'm just saying it was another angry old man.

32
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:12,999
Scott: Like both of them were trying to honk at you.

33
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:21,902
Rym: But I always want sort of real objective justice in the sense of society as opposed to sort of Karmic.

34
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:25,672
Rym: a dumb person was hurt because serendipitously another dumb person.

35
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:25,973
Rym: Yes.

36
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,436
Scott: Everyone wants justice.

37
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,760
Scott: It is the hardest thing to get.

38
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:35,074
Scott: That's why I always play as justice a magical drop And other games are just as cheap the cheapest one.

39
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:38,184
Rym: Anyway, anyway So you got any news.

40
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:38,886
Rym: gaming day?

41
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:47,429
Scott: I don't have any news necessarily, but I played this game that I saw Someone do a. I guess he does.

42
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:49,937
Scott: It's total halibut this guy on YouTube.

43
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:50,640
Scott: He made a video.

44
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:53,108
Scott: WTF is papers, please beta.

45
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:53,951
Scott: so papers, please.

46
00:02:54,012 --> 00:03:03,870
Scott: beta is a game Made by Lucas Pope who's I guess an indie game dev guy who's made a bunch of really interesting games And this is the latest one that's in beta right now.

47
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:05,800
Scott: You can just download it and play it for free.

48
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:12,071
Scott: So I've downloaded and played it for free and it is Crazy awesome this game.

49
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,660
Rym: So I haven't actually played it yet.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,031
Rym: So I have one question for you in terms of that kind of game.

51
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,740
Rym: Is it above or below old gravity bone?

52
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:29,035
Scott: It's not really anything like gravity bone at all in terms of quality, I guess of subjective experience I'd rather play this than gravity bone.

53
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:29,679
Rym: All right.

54
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:36,565
Scott: So the way it works is you live in some sort of police state in generic Europe The Stan I guess.

55
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,740
Scott: the country you live in is I forget how to pronounce it Aristic or whatever?

56
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,121
Scott: I don't know.

57
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:45,819
Scott: All right, and it's a stand basically and it's bordering all these other stands.

58
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:51,079
Scott: and What happens is you get conscripted to be the Border Patrol guy?

59
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:53,980
Scott: So your job is to sit there and approve passports.

60
00:03:54,641 --> 00:04:09,035
Scott: so it looks and feels graphically a lot like a Carmen Sandiego 90s kind of PC game and Basically people walk into your little booth You push a button to to use the loudspeaker to say next someone comes in.

61
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:10,319
Scott: you see their face.

62
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:12,819
Scott: Right behind them is a height chart.

63
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:19,740
Scott: Alright, they put a bunch of papers in the slot that you pick up You know with your mouse and move them over to your area so you can see them and flip through them.

64
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,005
Scott: You see their picture on their passport.

65
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:26,740
Scott: you see, you know all their information the passport numbers the official stamps.

66
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,360
Scott: There's all these details and you've got to sort out whether to approve or to let them in or not.

67
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,053
Scott: Let them in and there's all these tools at your disposal.

68
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:43,928
Scott: like you can look through the rule book You can look every day you get like a notice that says like, you know things that are happening today new rules things like that this news.

69
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:48,606
Scott: there's a newspaper and the newspaper is like so-and-so is Criminal whatever.

70
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:51,380
Scott: and then I see that guy come in and there's his name.

71
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,920
Scott: I remember him from the newspaper, but all his stuff checks out.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,077
Scott: so I call the guards over to arrest him even though his stuff checked out.

73
00:04:57,098 --> 00:05:05,640
Scott: and The thing is the more people you let through the more money you get which helps feed your starving and dying family.

74
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:12,826
Scott: Uh-huh, but but if you let through say a terrorist Then the day ends immediately.

75
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:21,360
Scott: or you know, there's plots like a girl comes in and gives like a card for like a strip club She's like, yeah, we're we are being you know, human trafficked.

76
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:23,306
Scott: This is the name of our human trafficker.

77
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,574
Scott: if he comes in don't let him through.

78
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:29,588
Scott: but that guy came in and he had a valid Shit, so I let him through in the newspaper the next day.

79
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,600
Scott: It said, you know human trafficking girls killed.

80
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:34,809
Rym: Good job asshole.

81
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,560
Scott: Hey, I will my family.

82
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,846
Rym: I Thought you wanted justice.

83
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:43,080
Scott: and then they'll be like, you know a terrorist came from a particular country.

84
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,393
Scott: So the next day anyone who comes from that particular country you have to use the you know X-ray scanner on them to see if they have you know goods.

85
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:52,104
Scott: so everyone who had goods I'm like up you're going.

86
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:52,827
Scott: you're going to jail.

87
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:56,440
Scott: good smuggler weapon bringer, but I got one guy came in.

88
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,512
Scott: He's like it was just medicine.

89
00:05:57,532 --> 00:06:04,740
Scott: you asshole You won't let me smuggle in medicine and I'm like, nope He's just trying to get medicine to his starving dying family.

90
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,402
Scott: You know.

91
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:09,314
Scott: and the thing is the book the game really will catch you with.

92
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:10,437
Scott: like these details and like.

93
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:12,037
Scott: do you have time to check to see?

94
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,079
Scott: You know every passport.

95
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:19,980
Scott: well They can issuing city and if that's and there's a book of which cities are issuing cities for which countries?

96
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:32,516
Scott: so it's like you either memorize that shit, which is a pain in the ass because you're not gonna memorize that shit or You basically ignore it and I ignore it and once every day There's one person like a wrong issuing city and I'm just like fuck it.

97
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:34,386
Scott: I don't care Is it?

98
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:35,532
Scott: you got to play this game?

99
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:37,905
Scott: I can't wait for the you know Final version to be out.

100
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:39,673
Scott: that if this is the beta holy shit.

101
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:41,060
Scott: What's the final gonna be basically?

102
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:52,260
Rym: I'm also on lately because I've had access to a lot of betas of games and if a game is good I almost don't want to play the beta and I'd rather play it once it's polished.

103
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:54,414
Rym: I don't kind of reach red ground.

104
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:58,750
Rym: Sure, but that's More than a trivial amount of don't starve.

105
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,497
Scott: this beta ends really quickly.

106
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:03,240
Scott: It's really short So you're not retreading ground, right?

107
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,280
Scott: It's gonna be like Monica where they add ground.

108
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:21,307
Scott: But the thing with this game is I really wish that would do a remix of it Where you would approve and disapprove people like in a modern setting and not in a fictional, you know Setting a police state setting and what you would it would do is at the end It would basically be like up.

109
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:25,628
Scott: This is your racial bias your racial profile But no one's met.

110
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:26,617
Scott: He's not making that game.

111
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:26,940
Scott: You know what?

112
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:32,200
Rym: A similar game but instead it's TSA and it's do you let stuff slide or not?

113
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,926
Rym: but the moral is there aren't any.

114
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:39,413
Rym: the only feel like one terrorist comes through out of a million people and The guys just got like a fucking bomb.

115
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:40,380
Rym: That's just obvious.

116
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:41,963
Rym: And that's it.

117
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,773
Scott: Anyway, you gotta check this thing out for free.

118
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:45,495
Scott: You got to check it out.

119
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:46,780
Scott: It's crazy good.

120
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,503
Rym: The only reason I didn't play it actually today was that I was at work when I learned about it and I was kind of Busy at work.

121
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:53,131
Rym: Yeah, I couldn't just take a game break.

122
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:54,860
Scott: Well, you can do this as soon as I leave.

123
00:07:55,502 --> 00:08:00,900
Rym: So as you guys know, I play a lot of counter-strike Scott's kind of falling off the counter-strike wagon.

124
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:04,480
Rym: I worry you won't be able to click on my head as quickly as I can click on his head.

125
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,581
Scott: If I I already have never been that fast at clicking on that I know.

126
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:15,460
Scott: but I uh, I'm even worse now clicking on that because I've actually played even less NS lately in favor of net run.

127
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:19,615
Rym: So I was really good at counter-strike back in the day as in I don't know.

128
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:27,730
Rym: Yes one six Mm-hmm early 2000s is when I was kind of at my peak game and I was super fucking good at counter-strike.

129
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,313
Rym: and You know, I've had my ups and downs and I've been playing pretty much continuously since then but not seriously.

130
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,600
Rym: and recently was counter-strike go.

131
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,474
Rym: I kind of doubled down on replaying counter-strike.

132
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:51,740
Rym: being older and slower I am better than pretty much anyone on the pubs but at the same time I am easily in the bottom third or bottom fourth of players in the Competitive circuit which is what you would expect.

133
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,409
Rym: I only play a few hours a day.

134
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:55,600
Scott: anyone who can actually click on heads kills you instantly.

135
00:08:56,001 --> 00:09:01,740
Rym: But I click on heads pretty well and counter-strike go hasn't been super popular.

136
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,798
Rym: like it's still a very popular game, but it hasn't been stupidly popular.

137
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:14,059
Rym: and It's interesting that valve is really sort of pushing and adding updates to it and Really trying to make counter-strike come back in a big way.

138
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:16,245
Rym: So they're supporting the competitive people and all that.

139
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:20,074
Rym: but there was just a huge update to counter-strike.

140
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:22,849
Rym: good did a number of things all right.

141
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:26,327
Rym: one Hostage mode has received an update.

142
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,593
Rym: It's not the same as it used to be now.

143
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,760
Rym: It is slightly less real.

144
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:32,454
Scott: You still play the old hostage mode.

145
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,705
Rym: Uh Maybe it depends on the map.

146
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:35,467
Scott: Hmm,

147
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:51,079
Rym: but basically on these new hostage maps and the way this mode works now instead of there being four kind of dopey hostages standing somewhere and You have to see T's have to get all of the ones who are still alive all the way back with their dope-ass getting stuck on crates mechanic.

148
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:56,416
Rym: Also the well, it's Italy just all sit in the house with sniper rifles.

149
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:57,300
Rym: Okay, let's go.

150
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:10,265
Rym: So they've changed it and now there's two Maybe three in some cases individual hostages sitting down In different places.

151
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:16,905
Rym: and what you do is you just guard him and if a counter terrorist finds one You can pick him up and carry.

152
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:21,158
Rym: him can still shoot but he's way slower carrying the hostage.

153
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,989
Scott: in other words Everyone's gonna get a hedge.

154
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,300
Scott: even I'm gonna get a headshot on the guy.

155
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:29,155
Rym: Pick up a hostage the terrorists get a ping that basically says oh shit guys.

156
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:31,825
Rym: Someone's gotta tell hostage They're walking out with.

157
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:36,066
Scott: so it's like catching the flag with a heavy fucking flag If you get and a bunch of flags.

158
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:39,520
Rym: if you get even one hostage out as CT's you immediately win.

159
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:46,436
Rym: Okay, it is made hostage maps way more fun and way less one-sided because.

160
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:48,220
Scott: but it really makes no sense.

161
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,557
Scott: It's like yeah, you guys let two hostages die, but you rescued one.

162
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:52,120
Scott: Good job.

163
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:56,790
Rym: Well, no It does make sense in one sense that it has that immediate situation of.

164
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:59,237
Rym: we've stormed the compound had a victory.

165
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,407
Rym: of the two hostages We got one out.

166
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:06,192
Rym: So I think the way I look at it These are two dignitaries the president and the vice president.

167
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:15,593
Scott: if I save one of them, it's probably good enough But much more important sure the one who died feels great about it.

168
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:22,120
Rym: the there there's a community Around making making maps that is very well supported for counter-strike go.

169
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:26,760
Rym: And what they've done is this all came out as part of operation payback.

170
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:38,515
Rym: Nobody seems to understand what operation payback is and everyone I saw in the internet was basically just complaining That they had to pay for some micro transaction.

171
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:39,157
Rym: bullshit.

172
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:39,559
Scott: Nope

173
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:42,366
Rym: If you pay

174
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:42,446
Scott: the

175
00:11:43,328 --> 00:12:03,760
Rym: three dollars that it costs you get a little thing that says you paid next to your name anywhere you play and until July 31st, you get access to low-paying Officially sanctioned run by steam servers that run just all these new maps in a tight rotation.

176
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:07,300
Scott: Nice, I should pay because those are probably no shit cock servers.

177
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:18,055
Rym: So basically you pay a tiny amount of money and as far as I can tell all or a significant portion of that money goes To the non employees who made these maps for the community.

178
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:19,380
Scott: That's something valve is doing a lot.

179
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:20,524
Scott: That's their big thing.

180
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:24,096
Scott: now right is basically save on the money that you know.

181
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:33,440
Scott: instead of hiring employees They set up the whole steam inventory system, which is like hey Regular old people out there make hats and you'll get money if people pay real money for those hats.

182
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,589
Scott: And it's not game affecting items.

183
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,099
Scott: It's all just cosmetic stuff like maps.

184
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,354
Rym: Yep It's not like pay three dollars to get the p92 twice as fast.

185
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:46,957
Scott: Yeah, no twice as many bullets don't have to reload right.

186
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:57,431
Scott: it's just pay money for maps and all this game content stuff that doesn't imbalance any games and Most or all of that money ends up going to the community.

187
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:58,555
Scott: people making that.

188
00:12:58,696 --> 00:12:59,900
Rym: so listen assholes.

189
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:01,687
Rym: You can play these maps anyway.

190
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,234
Rym: many of them were already out.

191
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:04,720
Rym: They're just from the steam workshop.

192
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:07,777
Rym: You can just download them and run them on your goddamn workshop.

193
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:08,280
Scott: so good.

194
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:19,870
Rym: But if you pay the three dollars you get access to awesome servers That only people who paid three dollars and people they invite are allowed to play on For the entire for most of the summer.

195
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:26,707
Rym: and let me tell you it's actually a really high quality community of people on those servers because of the Trivial barrier to entry.

196
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:31,460
Scott: if you want to make a game these days is you know and put it on steam Really?

197
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,767
Scott: You should make your game moddable via the steam workshop because that is gonna carry your game For the longest time.

198
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:41,200
Scott: if a community builds now the community can basically maintain your game.

199
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:49,960
Scott: you can stop maintaining your game and go do something else and You can focus and your community will pay your community to keep updating your game forever.

200
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:57,435
Rym: Or if you're one of those companies that really is focused on the game itself do this to offload The maps and kind of all that stuff to keep the community going.

201
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:58,260
Rym: it'll maintain itself.

202
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:04,702
Rym: But you can then take the resources you do want to spend on the game on doing things like fixing bugs or adding new Hostage.

203
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:06,691
Scott: look at NS2 right.

204
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:11,933
Scott: all most of their shit is from the steam workshop And they keep incorporating the community stuff into the game.

205
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:20,737
Scott: a lot of the maps that they have our community Community maps right I mean in the NS2 though right a lot of the maps started out as community maps.

206
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:24,832
Scott: a lot of the you Game modes we call the spectator thing was community made.

207
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:33,506
Scott: almost all this stuff was was made You know by in with the community people and also the actual developers, so It's pretty awesome.

208
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:36,220
Rym: none of that is my news other than my news is one.

209
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,740
Rym: I'm gonna double down as soon as I have time.

210
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:43,160
Rym: I'm gonna get these maps running on the GeekNights Counter-Strike server, and I'm gonna start still up.

211
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:44,185
Scott: yes, okay,

212
00:14:44,326 --> 00:15:00,979
Rym: and I'm gonna start organizing play dates and Standing games so that we can start playing this shit together because as much as I like playing with the clan people I play with I kind of want to be neo and walk around a god Looking on to you peasants destroying them as I see fit.

213
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:06,020
Rym: Okay, - the only news that actually matters that the seven maps are downtown.

214
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:06,722
Rym: I never.

215
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:09,930
Rym: really a lot of these are new you know vertigo.

216
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,843
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is just the bottom floor vertigo oh Clever.

217
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:25,280
Rym: and - I want to point out - all these maps are like militia and that they have crazy Details nice lots of weird little fucking room loading poops and toilets nothing like that.

218
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:30,380
Rym: Library which is this crazy maze of library with all kinds of awesome bookshelf.

219
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:31,604
Scott: It's gonna be good.

220
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:36,460
Rym: Ella is this really sort of weird vertical favela with stuff all over the place, okay?

221
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,169
Rym: Seaside has boats, okay Museum is just gorgeous to behold.

222
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,992
Scott: how about Vegas?

223
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:42,675
Rym: motel?

224
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:43,819
Rym: Vegas isn't there damn it?

225
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:50,023
Rym: Motel is pretty good, but uh CS Thunder CS Thunder.

226
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:52,450
Rym: this map was in Counter-Strike.

227
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:53,413
Scott: I think it was 1.1.

228
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:55,680
Scott: Yeah Counter-Strike something like that.

229
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:56,404
Scott: I think so.

230
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:57,751
Rym: I'm guess this is before that.

231
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:02,092
Rym: This is the ancient days Counter-Strike you know.

232
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:12,420
Scott: basically way back in the day There was one update to Counter-Strike that added a few maps one of those maps of CS Thunder Which was the best fucking map and then a later update?

233
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,108
Scott: Removed the map and the map was forgotten by.

234
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,034
Rym: there was a story like the.

235
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:20,359
Rym: the source to the map was lost So no one could recreate it.

236
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,093
Rym: I know is our favorite map ever and it was super popular at its time.

237
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:29,211
Rym: sadly nowadays I'm the majority people I played with have no idea.

238
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:30,496
Rym: They've never played Thunder before.

239
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,560
Rym: they're getting lost on it.

240
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,069
Rym: I had it memorized.

241
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,960
Rym: it is pretty much identical to the You.

242
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,416
Scott: just if you have a sniper rifle you go to the outside of the the hydroelectric dam.

243
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:42,410
Scott: if you don't you stay to the Inside and you go to the power control room.

244
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,140
Rym: you stand in that top area looking down.

245
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,464
Scott: You stay in the top area in the vent or in the catwalk And you hose everyone down.

246
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:58,357
Rym: if you get enough players like 15 on 15 this map will recreate over and over again That scene in the rock where the Navy Seals come into that room and all the terrorists are up above them.

247
00:16:58,537 --> 00:17:01,789
Rym: right that scene will Just play out every time meanwhile.

248
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:03,315
Rym: There's a sniper battle going on outside.

249
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:04,380
Rym: this map is so fun.

250
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,650
Scott: This map is the best map.

251
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:06,759
Rym: so kids stay tuned.

252
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,540
Scott: Please counter-strike the lost maps and sort of bring back every map.

253
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,464
Scott: Vegas Rig oil rig.

254
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:17,592
Rym: I really want some assassination maps coming back.

255
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:20,000
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what other what other maps were lost.

256
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,002
Scott: I forgot an Arab.

257
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:22,328
Rym: that map was a.

258
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,933
Scott: I'm just saying it's a lost map.

259
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:25,839
Rym: I don't care about bad lost maps.

260
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:27,243
Rym: I don't play jail.

261
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:30,094
Scott: What was the one with a back alley back alley?

262
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:31,920
Rym: I hated that map so much.

263
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,780
Scott: I'm not saying it's a good map and just saying the lost maps good or bad.

264
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:38,232
Rym: I want Jeep Athan Vegas oil rig Man.

265
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:42,312
Rym: Remember that goes to Gordon Freeman in the estate basement.

266
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:44,159
Rym: Yeah, I never knew how to make that occur.

267
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:45,965
Rym: So yeah stay tuned.

268
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,655
Rym: counter-strike shit be happening with GeekNights soon as we deal with anime.

269
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,260
Rym: Boston, Connecticut packs, Australia.

270
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,789
Rym: Things of the day.

271
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,260
Rym: I tumbled this earlier.

272
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:02,739
Rym: I have a tumbler so you can follow me there.

273
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:06,920
Rym: But I promise the tumbler won't just be previews of things of the day going forward.

274
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,493
Rym: But this is just too good to not be a thing of the day.

275
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:10,840
Rym: It is my thing of the day.

276
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:18,848
Scott: This is a collection of Soviet anti-drinking posters anti drinking So basically the most ineffective posters in the universe.

277
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:21,516
Rym: basically these posters are like stop drinking you assholes.

278
00:18:21,597 --> 00:18:22,640
Rym: It's ruining everything.

279
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:33,974
Rym: Here's a guy a plumbers like drinking with this bottle of Boca You know back And he's dancing with this broken ass pipe that I guess he was supposed to.

280
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:35,260
Scott: that means we want to drink.

281
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:39,380
Rym: These all make me run a drink but there maybe that's the exact reason.

282
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:43,460
Rym: There's one where guys just drinking about to walk off a cliff and the government's like stop.

283
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,905
Scott: I just imagined a bunch of guys.

284
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:48,980
Scott: they're sitting in the propaganda office and it's like alright guys you to make anti drinking posters.

285
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,685
Scott: What drinking posters?

286
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,369
Scott: as in telling people do not drink?

287
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:56,100
Scott: They're sitting there drinking and he's like, why'd you say come rad?

288
00:18:56,523 --> 00:19:03,034
Rym: I'll just say one thing The Soviet Union overall not the greatest thing to have happened in the history of humanity,

289
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:03,796
Scott: but

290
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:17,740
Rym: the art especially the propaganda art that came out of the Soviet era is one of my favorite kinds of art and There are so many different styles Represented here, but they're so recognizably Soviet.

291
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:19,166
Rym: Enjoy these.

292
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:22,117
Rym: the soda pop in skiing vodka drinking ski.

293
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:28,580
Scott: That's right Okay, so my thing of the day is this trailer for a game that came out today.

294
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,054
Scott: I haven't played it yet And the reason I haven't bought this game yet today is because it may.

295
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:37,234
Scott: I'm not sure I'm you know But it may have microtransactions pay-to-win.

296
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:40,247
Scott: if it does not have those things I will buy this game today.

297
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:42,316
Rym: all I know cuz Scott watched the trailer.

298
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:42,678
Rym: I didn't.

299
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:46,753
Rym: I was at work You know working the trailer just now just now but earlier I hadn't.

300
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:50,700
Rym: so I see internet all the people I know on the internet like oh my god this game.

301
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:52,672
Rym: Ah, and I clicked.

302
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:53,478
Rym: I looked I'm like what?

303
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:57,554
Rym: All right It looks like some kind of RTS like what's going on here and I kind of ignored it.

304
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,080
Rym: then I watched the trailer.

305
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:01,549
Scott: Yeah, so it's called Leviathan warships.

306
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:04,339
Scott: It's a turn-based boat strategy game.

307
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,479
Scott: It has four game modes.

308
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:10,935
Scott: It has all kinds of good shit that the coolest thing it has is.

309
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:13,909
Scott: that has co-op and multiplayer And of course is turn-based.

310
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:23,169
Scott: so you can take a turn on your PC then take a turn on your iPad and your opponent could take a turn on their iPad and then on their Android tablet and then On their Mac and then in there to be the best part.

311
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,600
Rym: what this trailer is the best trailer.

312
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,110
Scott: That's why it's a thing of the day.

313
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:27,794
Scott: It's like it was.

314
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:36,668
Scott: the game announcement Is the best video game trailer I have ever seen in my entire life And I've seen a lot of video game trailers.

315
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:39,760
Rym: the moment where he got me is it just cuts to the ship customization.

316
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,311
Rym: He's like you want to customize your boats.

317
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:43,556
Rym: we can head start.

318
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,146
Rym: I was like, oh my god I want to click on that right now.

319
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:48,635
Rym: I just want to drag boat lasers out of my boat.

320
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:49,900
Rym: Look at all those holes.

321
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,084
Rym: I'm gonna fill it with boat lasers Boat lasers.

322
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:54,068
Scott: this game has.

323
00:20:54,188 --> 00:21:01,050
Rym: that's the one thing missing from the new xcom that I kind of miss The actual inventory Tetris.

324
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,640
Scott: We'll have to start calling it Leviathan warship inventory.

325
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:06,329
Rym: It's fine because clips inventory Tetris.

326
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:19,739
Scott: I believe by noon tomorrow the torchbearer Kickstarter will be I think exactly at noon tomorrow the torchbearer Kickstarter will have be happening Clenching because there is no torch in it.

327
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:23,711
Rym: I'm holding this pistol grip for the HD camera.

328
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:26,725
Rym: Yeah, I Need a sword met a moment.

329
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:27,488

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,205
Scott: I can't you ever do in chronological order.

337
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:39,529
Rym: That's on purpose.

338
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,613
Scott: It's anime Boston.

339
00:21:40,653 --> 00:21:41,335

Rym: PAX Prime Well, then PAX dev probably.

342
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:49,999
Rym: then PAX Prime all right, and then we had a little bit of a break because we're probably like hot Scott or anything.

343
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:54,165
Rym: and Then magfest Mark MAGFest.

344
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:55,029
Rym: Oh my god.

345
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:57,558
Rym: I keep forgetting that magfest is gonna have machine supremacy.

346
00:21:57,618 --> 00:21:58,080
Scott: That's right.

347
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:03,126
Rym: I haven't been looking forward to a concert as much as I'm looking only Seven months away.

348
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:05,899
Scott: Ah, I guess we should get our panels in.

349
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:08,860
Rym: And yeah, we got shit on the internet.

350
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:20,745
Rym: We just uploaded video of the second of our packs lectures from this most recent PAX East our 23rd goddamn packs panel 23 in all those years.

351
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:22,451
Rym: We did 16 Otakon panels.

352
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:23,475
Rym: We have 23 packs.

353
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:24,820
Scott: It's something just fly by the window.

354
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:26,265
Scott: I think it was a clock.

355
00:22:26,505 --> 00:22:27,308
Rym: So Monaco.

356
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:31,682
Rym: I'll link to the other shows we've done on this but in a word Brilliant.

357
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:36,598
Rym: It's everything I expected it to be having watched it since 2010 right?

358
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,009
Scott: so think about the early prototype of this game won mad awards at GDC or IGDA or whatever it is.

359
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:44,801
Scott: It won a ton of fucking awards the earliest of prototypes Right.

360
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:54,111
Scott: and the guy basically takes this game and for years just keeps working on it and keeps working on it and keeps working on It and every time he brings it out of packs in its car.

361
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:54,733
Rym: I'll give you $100 right now.

362
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,679
Scott: don't die the game was already fucking incredible when it was brand new prototype.

363
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:21,612
Scott: and He brings out of packs like every packs with a slightly updated version and it keeps getting updated and updated and he just kept working On it and actually didn't stop working on it for many years just kept upgrading the game and improving on it and iterating and adding stuff to it and It would be just so much better every single time.

364
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:23,820
Scott: and it's like well, why even fucking release this game?

365
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:29,980
Scott: Just keep you know updating it or be like minecraft give it to us now and just keep giving us updates all the time.

366
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:31,686
Scott: But no, they didn't do that.

367
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:34,576
Scott: They just get working on it until like a week ago.

368
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:38,540
Rym: Maybe a few days ago We got it a little earlier because we got a review copy.

369
00:23:38,841 --> 00:23:42,239
Scott: They just friggin finally put it out saying here it is all these years of work.

370
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:44,952
Scott: We weren't you know Duke Nukem forevering.

371
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:46,560
Scott: We weren't half-life 3-ing.

372
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,590
Scott: We really were just improving on it and not releasing it till it was done.

373
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,097
Scott: Just like half-life 1. and here it is.

374
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:57,034
Scott: and Yeah, it's still terrific pocketwatch games.

375
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:57,738
Rym: I salute you.

376
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:02,767
Rym: The game is great But the thing is it's guy.

377
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:06,840
Rym: there were things I expected to be great because I already played it in its early iterations.

378
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,020
Rym: Those things were still there and I was already excited about those.

379
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:14,296
Rym: But there were things that were great that I didn't anticipate.

380
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:19,598
Rym: I did not expect The characters and story to actually be what they were.

381
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:29,240
Scott: Yeah I mean, I thought the game would just be sort of like, you know The characters are just sort of classes and they don't really matter But they put in like this whole story to this thing.

382
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:37,552
Rym: It's a pretty good story and I think my favorite that the level of detail and we'll talk about what the game is in a. In case you've lived under a rock since 2009 ish.

383
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:45,109
Rym: But basically I noticed at one point when I just started playing I just got that review copy and I keep.

384
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,419
Rym: I say we have a review copy because in full disclosure we do.

385
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,584
Rym: I hate it When people don't disclose.

386
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:52,400
Rym: they got something for free cuz you know by us or I paid for it actually bought a four-pack.

387
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,233
Scott: I gave away two keys already.

388
00:24:54,254 --> 00:24:59,393
Scott: I just gave one away I think in the newsletter and I gave one away on Google our Google Plus.

389
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:09,658
Rym: Maybe I'll give the other one away sometime But it was the fact that I was playing as Someone and I ran into a bathroom and I was like, oh I can pee cool.

390
00:25:09,738 --> 00:25:12,336
Rym: That's funny Yeah, and I always kind of want to hide in the bathroom.

391
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:12,819
Rym: Just kind of pee.

392
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:13,675
Rym: This is what I do.

393
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:21,609
Rym: And then one time I was playing as one of the characters trying to avoid spoilers there because you guys should just play this game And I couldn't pee and I was like what?

394
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:23,640
Rym: Oh, it's a girl duh, duh.

395
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:33,760
Scott: Yeah, the the attention to detail in this game the time, you know Even though it's basically you look at it from far away and it's a bunch of pixelated mess just moving around.

396
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:44,536
Rym: It's like what the hell is going on but if you're focused on it like you're playing it it starts to become a sort of Blue like you start to just sort of jive and see through the matrix and see exactly what.

397
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:48,856
Rym: like you look at your little iconic Dude, your little red splotch, you know exactly what's up.

398
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:51,840
Scott: Yep Anyway, so what is this game Monaco?

399
00:25:52,101 --> 00:26:01,278
Scott: It is a game about some thieves and these thieves bust out of jail And then they are trying to thieve their way to the riches and it's all oceans.

400
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:01,398
Scott: 11 shit.

401
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,330
Scott: You've got a person for every possible role that you would need.

402
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:11,870
Scott: you've got a gentleman the recon the mole Yep, the lock-picking the cleaner the hack.

403
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,396
Rym: I like the cleaner a lot.

404
00:26:13,636 --> 00:26:14,620
Scott: Yeah, that's your guy.

405
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:16,928
Rym: I pretty much play the cleaner or the mole.

406
00:26:16,948 --> 00:26:18,975
Scott: I like to play the hacker.

407
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:21,526
Scott: actually once I got the hacker I was like, oh shit.

408
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:23,939
Rym: Yeah, I can hit those power outlets exactly for it.

409
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:35,660
Scott: So here's the thing right, you know how in a lot of games you'll have a situation where we're like You know a class does something in particular, but maybe that class isn't really needed in a particular map or level.

410
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,011
Scott: So it's like if you choose that class for that level, you're like, ah shit, right?

411
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:46,135
Scott: So for example, maybe you picked the Locksmith right, but this level doesn't really have that many locked doors.

412
00:26:46,336 --> 00:26:48,907
Scott: It's like oh It's so disappointing right.

413
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:52,300
Scott: or maybe you pick the hacker and this level doesn't have really any computers.

414
00:26:53,182 --> 00:26:54,347
Rym: Every level has every.

415
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:57,460
Scott: every level has everything you can't pick wrong.

416
00:26:57,621 --> 00:27:00,012
Scott: And this is why I like the hacker the most.

417
00:27:00,072 --> 00:27:07,720
Scott: not because it's thematically You know hacker or because it's bright neon green like hacker, even though those actually are good reasons as green is the best.

418
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:15,740
Scott: The reason that I like to pick the hacker is because the security systems are the most annoying.

419
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:25,454
Scott: It's like yeah I could you know dodge one laser at a time and hack one laser at a time and one alarm Break the motherfucking wall down and walk around it.

420
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:28,448
Scott: sure you can do that too But it's tedious right either?

421
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:30,700
Scott: one of those things is tedious with the hacker.

422
00:27:31,062 --> 00:27:37,307
Scott: All you have to do is get to the power outlet hit it for a few seconds and like Multiple rooms just open up to you.

423
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:38,070
Scott: No problem.

424
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:48,580
Scott: You will just walk right through it's it's so You know of all the classes that one the most Reduces tedium and allows you to breeze through quickly.

425
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:58,018
Scott: I think if you're going for speed runs, which it seems some people are doing Guessing probably incorrectly that depending on the level hacker or mole are your guys.

426
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:58,700
Rym: I like mole.

427
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,269
Rym: I don't use mole so much to get in is to get out.

428
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:08,037
Rym: I'll go around with the mole and basically make Escape routes for after shit gets fucked.

429
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,700
Rym: Oh You're thinking hard because this game people have called it off and on a stealth game or an action game.

430
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,904
Scott: There are stealth aspects.

431
00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:18,894
Rym: there are but I think this is a genre.

432
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:21,810
Rym: We have rarely if ever seen I'm going to say right now.

433
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,979
Rym: This is a heist game.

434
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:26,472
Rym: Heist is different from stealth in that in a stealth game.

435
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:28,360
Rym: Look at mark of the ninja, which I've been playing a lot of.

436
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,043
Rym: I love that game.

437
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,067
Scott: That's a stealth game for sure.

438
00:28:30,107 --> 00:28:30,850
Rym: That is a stealth game.

439
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:33,399
Scott: It's a stealth puzzle platformer.

440
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:41,872
Rym: Yeah independent of Other aspects even if there is a way to fight or survive or get away if you fuck up The majority of people who are into games.

441
00:28:41,932 --> 00:28:43,460
Rym: if you're playing a stealth game you get seen.

442
00:28:43,982 --> 00:28:47,113
Rym: You just kill yourself and start over because you're going for that perfect run.

443
00:28:47,614 --> 00:28:53,173
Scott: It's also in stealth games Fighting is usually super hard and dangerous like in Metal Gear Solid.

444
00:28:53,193 --> 00:28:55,020
Scott: Basically, I would get seen and killed.

445
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,968
Rym: I could get away but fuck that I fucked up.

446
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:02,071
Rym: I'd being seen was tantamount to losing.

447
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:07,592
Rym: as far as I was concerned in my own meta In Monaco, the game is not up.

448
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:08,415
Rym: you were seen now.

449
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:09,600
Rym: Everything sucks.

450
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:13,960
Rym: The game is sneak sneak sneak and then eventually you make a mistake.

451
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:18,260
Rym: Someone's seen the alarm blows and then shit goes crazy.

452
00:29:19,062 --> 00:29:19,644
Rym: It's just now.

453
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:21,310
Rym: it's everyone's like running around.

454
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:29,280
Rym: the plan breaks down like every heist movie where you've got the perfect plan And then you know Scott Stepp breaks the you know breaks the laser beam and the alarm goes off.

455
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:32,230
Rym: And then it's every man for himself and it's just chaos.

456
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:38,853
Rym: Yep, and the fact that that chaos Is guaranteed to happen at least once every other mission.

457
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:40,620
Rym: It's guaranteed to happen constant.

458
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:42,520
Rym: I've had a few missions that go off smoothly.

459
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:50,980
Rym: You'll have the plan and the plan works But the plan not working is just as fun as the plan working and that is why I love Monaco.

460
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:54,217
Scott: It's also, you know, not that hard to escape right?

461
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:55,646
Scott: if you run No one sees.

462
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:57,280
Scott: you can like you hide in a bush or something.

463
00:29:57,681 --> 00:30:00,211
Scott: You can wait a while and the chaos will calm down.

464
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:02,780
Scott: you can sort of try to pick up the piece exactly.

465
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:09,558
Rym: But it's a situation of you've got one guy who's like off in the corner somewhere and there's guards everywhere over there And he can't get away.

466
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:11,218
Scott: He's the mole he can.

467
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:15,400
Rym: Sometimes the mole if he gets surrounded by a bunch of guards doesn't have a weapon.

468
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,028
Rym: He can't break through walls fast enough.

469
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,535
Scott: No, not at all.

470
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:21,451
Rym: Ah But I I love this game.

471
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:27,880
Rym: the online co-op works pretty well But it's really shines if you're playing together with people in the same room in my a lot of the levels, right?

472
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,699
Scott: I guess it's theoretically possible to beat everything alone, but it's super hard.

473
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,767
Scott: It's crazy hard to do it alone.

474
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:42,115
Scott: If you have friends it becomes way easier, but Because then you'll actually have a person who can actually do everything right?

475
00:30:42,135 --> 00:30:47,840
Scott: It's like if I'm the hacker I'll go in and disable a bunch of computers, but then right after that it'll be like man.

476
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:51,770
Scott: I wish I had the mole right now to go through that wall But you don't you're the hacker.

477
00:30:51,972 --> 00:30:55,732
Scott: if you had a hacker and a mole Well now you're talking business or maybe there'll be a guard.

478
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:56,696
Scott: You just can't get around.

479
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:57,620
Scott: It's like man.

480
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:02,300
Scott: I wish we had fucking either the gentleman with his costume and a weapon or the cleaner.

481
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:08,320
Scott: So if you have a cleaner and a hacker and a mole now, you're really set Really most fun with three or four players.

482
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:14,960
Rym: I got a good chunk of the way through the game completely by myself But it's really tedious and not nearly as fun, right?

483
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,060
Scott: If you have more people you can breeze through much faster much more efficiently.

484
00:31:19,201 --> 00:31:21,994
Scott: But here are the problems with having more people.

485
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:23,240
Scott: you need to a coordinate.

486
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:24,244
Scott: Yeah, you can do.

487
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:28,240
Scott: you can do that unless your Rym - Scott is the worst cop.

488
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,947
Scott: People means more people fucking up.

489
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:35,820
Scott: need I remind you of the level in four swords with the searchlights?

490
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,312
Rym: That was one of my most memorable gaming moments.

491
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:42,220
Scott: with four people, right?

492
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,429
Scott: You're gonna have four times as many fuck-ups, right?

493
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:47,294
Scott: Cuz everyone's gonna fuck up pretty much equally.

494
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:57,000
Rym: I Think I think it was the ninth or tenth time We've been hit by a searchlight and I don't remember who said it but someone said guys the fuck is wrong with you.

495
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:58,445
Rym: How hard is it to not get?

496
00:31:58,565 --> 00:32:02,317
Rym: and it must have been karma, but that was when the searchlight got him.

497
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:02,940
Scott: That's right.

498
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:05,906
Rym: So, did you beat the game?

499
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:06,929
Scott: no, I'd be.

500
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,855
Scott: I didn't even beat all the blue love.

501
00:32:08,935 --> 00:32:10,400
Rym: Oh, oh, okay.

502
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:23,639
Rym: So not gonna spoil stuff, but I'll say this some things happen in the game that are unexpected obviously and Game mode may change in a certain instance.

503
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:30,140
Rym: Trying to be really vague about this because it's the game is too good for me to waste my breath.

504
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,305
Rym: Spoiling crap for you.

505
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:35,220
Rym: There is no reason anyone listening to GeekNights should not buy this game.

506
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:40,080
Scott: Yeah, and if you have to buy a four-pack, it's cheap and give the rest of you don't even need xbla.

507
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,406
Rym: I don't think even works on xbla.

508
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:44,280
Scott: Yeah, I think the Xbox version they're having trouble releasing it.

509
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,752
Scott: There's a statement on their site or something.

510
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:46,700
Scott: Just buy the steam one.

511
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,603
Scott: What the hell is wrong with you.

512
00:32:47,743 --> 00:32:51,535
Rym: and this game will run on pretty pathetic hardware and it works perfectly.

513
00:32:51,615 --> 00:32:57,472
Scott: with steam big picture mode On your TV with Xbox wireless or wired controllers it works.

514
00:32:57,552 --> 00:32:58,875
Scott: It's designed that way.

515
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:00,219
Scott: it's designed for that shit.

516
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:04,734
Rym: But yeah, seriously stuff happens at the end of the game.

517
00:33:04,754 --> 00:33:13,313
Scott: That is crazy and unexpected I mean if they're working on for so many years, all right I would hope that you know, this would be the most polished and yeah, it is.

518
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:15,000
Scott: It is the most polished and amazing.

519
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:18,673
Rym: So the visual style, you know pixelation everything aside.

520
00:33:19,195 --> 00:33:28,187
Rym: what I like about it is The Specifically the fact that it does that Ultima sort of style line of sight where if you can't see it You just can't see it

521
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:29,758
Scott: unless you're the lookout

522
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:34,116
Rym: true But even then the lookout just sees like the floating gun or the fist or the little doggy.

523
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:35,300
Scott: see that reminds me, right?

524
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,920
Scott: Another thing this game does, you know, I already mentioned four swords.

525
00:33:39,402 --> 00:33:41,991
Scott: It gives you the Crystal Chronicles kind of action right where?

526
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:48,518
Scott: remember in Crystal Chronicles on your GBA screen Everyone had something different one person at the map and one person had like the mission, right?

527
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:53,220
Rym: Whatever Sort of thing it forces you to share information among yourselves.

528
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:57,497
Scott: It's not classes in the same way as Team Fortress 2, right?

529
00:33:57,597 --> 00:34:04,760
Scott: It's Really strictly defined roles more than just classes, but everyone sort of has the same role, right?

530
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,636
Rym: Recon fucking hide there and recon for me or a scout so I can see where I'm going.

531
00:34:10,656 --> 00:34:12,630
Rym: don't get up to start running around For no reason.

532
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:16,938
Rym: Yep And I think what I hate the most is guard dogs though.

533
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:18,839
Scott: Yeah, guard dogs are pretty rough.

534
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:22,675
Scott: A lot of the weapons are silenced like you can just get.

535
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:26,172
Scott: if you get a gun You can get away with shooting a lot of people.

536
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:26,594
Scott: Yeah.

537
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:31,076
Rym: Oh, you know many times I've cut the power just to murder the guard who comes to turn the power back on.

538
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:33,868
Rym: Mm-hmm That is like my go-to strategy.

539
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:36,357
Scott: And the thing is the items are really fucking useful.

540
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:36,980
Scott: you get the EMP.

541
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,668
Scott: It's like yeah, it fucking cuts the power.

542
00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:42,612
Scott: if you actually, you know use the computer virus thing It's like yeah It freaking.

543
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:47,820
Scott: you know All the computer things in the sequence of where you walk so that you can get through very easily.

544
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,266
Scott: It's like, you know when you.

545
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:51,900
Scott: these special abilities that you have are crazy powerful.

546
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:55,940
Scott: The mole can dig through any wall on any map anywhere ever.

547
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,569
Rym: Well, there are a few things he can't dig through.

548
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:59,560
Scott: can't dig through to go jump out of a building.

549
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,303
Rym: Yeah, he also there's.

550
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,508
Rym: there's a courtyard.

551
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:03,415
Rym: There's one kind of like ultra security wall.

552
00:35:03,455 --> 00:35:04,600
Rym: He can't seem to dig through either.

553
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:05,623
Scott: Oh, I have an encounter.

554
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:06,426
Rym: It's not common.

555
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:08,011
Rym: Hmm, at least as far as I've seen.

556
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:10,600
Rym: I've never not been able to dig somewhere.

557
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,643
Rym: I really wanted to dig.

558
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:17,400
Scott: Yeah, but it but it's like yeah, right and everybody has a crazy powerful superpower like dune.

559
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:18,749
Scott: That is way off.

560
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:20,380
Rym: What I was getting at is that the visual style.

561
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:35,048
Rym: There's the line-of-sight thing but augmenting that is that the places you can't see show either nothing or a blueprint of what should be there which is fantastic Immersion for a number of reasons.

562
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:40,631
Rym: one if you blow shit up and change stuff around The blueprint does not update to reflect that.

563
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:42,016
Rym: that's the plan from before.

564
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:42,679
Rym: you guys went

565
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:43,239
Scott: in Yep

566
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:58,376
Rym: Which is just really cool like you come around the corner because you forgot that you blew up a whole room and then you see Oh the room is still blown up and there's a bunch of cops here great And to some of the missions and sometimes you don't know what the place is like or the plan went wrong.

567
00:35:58,778 --> 00:35:59,480
Rym: You don't see shit.

568
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:09,060
Scott: Yeah It's pretty much the information that you have on the screen is the information that your criminal guy would have in that high Situation and it's just communicated so elegantly.

569
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:12,333
Scott: Right, but at the same time you have to sort of see through the matrix.

570
00:36:12,394 --> 00:36:13,860
Scott: if you're just watching some people play.

571
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,108
Scott: It's gonna be like what but the people are playing.

572
00:36:16,128 --> 00:36:16,670
Scott: you're like whoo.

573
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:20,201
Scott: go like no, they know exactly what's going on Now.

574
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:23,820
Scott: and if you pick up the controller and move around a little bit, you'll know exactly what's going on.

575
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,164
Rym: So let's talk about that game.

576
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:30,700
Rym: design wise the game is ridiculously intuitive and doesn't really need to rely at all on.

577
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:38,220
Scott: No, no, Mega Man Mega Man Like at one point a little bit where it says like yeah get ten coins to get more ammo for your item.

578
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,699
Rym: Yeah, but notice how it only does that for things that are actually not directly intuitive.

579
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:52,362
Rym: Yep But as a result, there are so few core mechanics and they visualize so well that the game teaches you Automatically.

580
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:57,114
Scott: the only buttons you have right and it Megaman's these at the beginning right is walk around.

581
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,698
Scott: Yep use an item.

582
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:04,869
Scott: Yep sneak sneak and Look at your objectives and how much money you have.

583
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,271
Rym: Yep.

584
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:06,556
Scott: That's it.

585
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:07,519
Scott: That's all you do.

586
00:37:07,821 --> 00:37:11,195
Scott: It's most things in the game you interact with just by bumping into them.

587
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:12,240
Scott: It's like oh, there's a lock.

588
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,063
Scott: How do I pick the lock?

589
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:13,766
Scott: walk into it?

590
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:14,148
Scott: Now?

591
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:15,393
Scott: How do I hack that computer?

592
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:15,915
Scott: walk in.

593
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:17,060
Rym: all these things are different.

594
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:22,180
Rym: I steal things walking stairs start the helicopter start the getaway car crack the safe.

595
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:27,220
Rym: They all just show a little clock that ticks down at the time until you're gonna finish that task.

596
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,760
Scott: So all you do is walk up to something keep walking into it until the clock finishes.

597
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,102
Rym: Conundrums of.

598
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,291
Rym: so there's a treasure that isn't what I'm after.

599
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:38,440
Rym: that's in that room surrounded by a bunch of guard dogs and shit.

600
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:42,639
Rym: I wonder if I can pick that lock in time before the guard dog comes back.

601
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:44,645
Scott: Yeah and the game will reward you.

602
00:37:44,685 --> 00:37:49,359
Scott: basically every level you get sort of scored based on a. how much of the treasures did you get?

603
00:37:49,379 --> 00:37:50,684
Scott: and Be?

604
00:37:50,987 --> 00:37:52,400
Scott: how fast did you do it, right?

605
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,190
Scott: So it's how fast did you complete the objective and how much treasure you got?

606
00:37:55,652 --> 00:37:56,174
Scott: and it's you.

607
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,860
Scott: basically you can go for complete treasure.

608
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,245
Scott: you can go for fastest time.

609
00:37:59,286 --> 00:38:02,699
Scott: you can go for both you, you know, it's sort of like portal does that?

610
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,865
Scott: and What's a space cam?

611
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:05,247
Scott: does that?

612
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:05,669
Scott: Yes.

613
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:12,176
Scott: Cam is like less symbols or less, you know You know, whatever is faster finishing and whatever.

614
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:12,940
Scott: It's the same thing.

615
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,479
Scott: We have multiple scoring metrics for challenging yourself.

616
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:22,080
Rym: So at one point you see an icon on a thing that looks like a dress like a tee a shirt like a work shirt.

617
00:38:22,602 --> 00:38:23,466
Rym: Do you use that?

618
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:26,820
Rym: suddenly you're in a costume and guys just think you're a normal, dude.

619
00:38:27,445 --> 00:38:35,920
Scott: Yeah, unless they get too close to you Then they sort of sniff away your costume or your disguise still gets you or in the hospital if you open those fucking boarded doors.

620
00:38:36,182 --> 00:38:40,065
Scott: Yep, you know, but it's like yeah Disguises are fucking amazing.

621
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,032
Rym: Yeah, that's why the gentleman is pretty cool.

622
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:42,855
Scott: Yeah, I like it.

623
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,100
Scott: when you get another character.

624
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:47,280
Scott: See the gentleman can get a costume disguise any time, which is great.

625
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:54,060
Scott: But like if another character gets a disguise super powerful hacker with a disguise you just fucking walk up and hack everything.

626
00:38:55,324 --> 00:39:12,800
Rym: When you hack something a little green squirrel I guess yeah green square pops out of you And if it's some other someone else hacks a normal computer Then it's the color square of them just moves around the map along these wires Kind of disabling everything it bumps into until guards or time or whatever on hack it.

627
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:14,440
Rym: Yeah, so you can just hack a bunch of stuff.

628
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,580
Rym: You kind of see your virus program going around cleaning stuff up for you, which is awesome.

629
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:25,594
Scott: The game's just intuitive means all because every most of the level designs, you know Every character is useful in every level no matter what level it is.

630
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:34,460
Scott: There's gonna be a thing to hack All right, there's gonna be a wall to break through When you get the hacking going on all the security systems just off and it's just like oh so relaxing.

631
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,845
Scott: I can't stress that enough.

632
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:40,080
Rym: The other thing I like is that if you kill a dude, there's a little Skellington laying there.

633
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:43,433
Scott: Oh, yeah, and if someone sees it they freak out and you can push it by.

634
00:39:43,453 --> 00:39:45,140
Scott: you can push walking into it.

635
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:46,165
Rym: But yeah, I didn't.

636
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:49,260
Rym: I kind of didn't think about that because in mark of the ninja that's a big deal.

637
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,532
Rym: Like when I kill someone I drag their body somewhere and hide it.

638
00:39:52,095 --> 00:40:01,619
Rym: So I kill a dude I'm doing about my business and then suddenly I see this person come around the corner and bump into the Skeleton and then freak out And run and call someone on the phone and then guards are up my ass.

639
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:04,273
Scott: You can also hack the phones and then they can't call.

640
00:40:04,353 --> 00:40:05,800
Scott: you can go and pick up the phone yourself.

641
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:09,520
Scott: You can go make a phone call to get someone to pick up at the other end.

642
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:19,419
Rym: This game just does so much so elegantly with such economy That it is easily one of the best games to come out this year.

643
00:40:20,142 --> 00:40:23,852
Scott: Yeah, I mean we saw it coming and we saw correctly.

644
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,376
Rym: It's everything I expected.

645
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:28,308
Rym: It's in many ways It's better than I expected in other ways.

646
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:30,800
Rym: I have almost nothing negative to say about it.

647
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,117
Rym: You know what?

648
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:42,540
Scott: This really replaces at least until everybody's beaten every level and gotten tired of it is the bomber man Does because it's like it's that kind of party game, you know, you know slot in your gaming library.

649
00:40:43,002 --> 00:40:47,580
Scott: But it the thing it doesn't have that bomber man does is sort of an infinite replayability, right?

650
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,209
Rym: It does have the ability does.

651
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:50,992
Scott: don't get me wrong though.

652
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:53,000
Scott: This game has a zillion fucking levels.

653
00:40:53,462 --> 00:40:54,064
Scott: holy shit does.

654
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,148
Scott: the game have a lot of levels.

655
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:01,920
Scott: you will not get old quickly, but Once you and all your friends have played all the levels eventually, it's like, okay.

656
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,360
Rym: But then what becomes fun is if you play like you've got two veterans and two people who have never played the game before.

657
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:14,043
Rym: It's just like in the heist movie with two veterans telling Robert Redford how to do it Like you.

658
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:14,626
Rym: listen kid.

659
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:15,751
Rym: Don't touch that.

660
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:16,454
Rym: That's an alarm.

661
00:41:16,595 --> 00:41:17,659
Rym: I want you to go over there.

662
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:18,900
Rym: I want you to hack that computer.

663
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:22,517
Rym: Yeah, and then when he doesn't hack the computer and dicks around on his own and shit goes down.

664
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:25,479
Rym: you can yell I told you as you run past his skeleton with the loot.

665
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:32,499
Scott: There's also a little bit super meat boy action where you sort of play the level and die and then play it again And now you know where shit is and you know where to go.

666
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:38,269
Scott: Yeah, and there's also the thing is when you die Basically, you don't lose until all the characters are dead.

667
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:38,791
Scott: Right?

668
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,476
Scott: So and every time moles dead.

669
00:41:40,536 --> 00:41:46,011
Scott: Well, yeah You can't use the mole again in this level and it's like shit.

670
00:41:46,272 --> 00:41:49,142
Scott: cuz like you'll pick the character who's most useful for beating that Level.

671
00:41:49,504 --> 00:41:51,820
Scott: they'll die and it's like well you have to beat the carrot.

672
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:55,297
Scott: If you're playing one player now, you have to beat the level with a different character.

673
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:55,920
Scott: Not that one.

674
00:41:56,023 --> 00:42:05,080
Scott: It's like well That's gonna be a huge pain in my ass To do it the other way and then you eventually just die all the way and then you start over with the same guy again.

675
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:12,875
Rym: so This is one of the very rare Completely unqualified buys I can think of no one who hears these words right now.

676
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:13,880
Rym: who should not buy this game?

677
00:42:14,303 --> 00:42:19,648
Scott: someone who does not have a PC or an Xbox cannot buy this game.

678
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:22,676
Rym: someone who actually does not have the $15 or whatever.

679
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:25,178
Scott: You're that poor.

680
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:28,157
Scott: Seriously, any computer can play this freaking game.

681
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:34,512
Scott: Yeah Any as long as you have a GPU Like an old-ass GPU like the oldest in dude.

682
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:37,822
Rym: I'm playing it on a GTX 260.

683
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:53,295
Scott: it works beautifully on my HTPC which has like some AMD an ATI like hat low-profile piece of crap Radeon something old GTX 440 Something low-profile and with an i3 it runs flawlessly at 1080p.

684
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:56,693
Scott: So Yeah, get this game.

685
00:42:56,813 --> 00:43:03,997
Scott: we told you a long time ago This game is good enough to do two full GeekNights episode and an interview with Andy Schatz.

686
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:07,170
Scott: That was one of the episodes Like I think we did.

00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:08,340
Rym: I did a preview I forget.

688
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,140
Scott: I think I don't know how we can possibly recommend a thing more.

689
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,980
Scott: We did more talk about this game on GeekNights than about like prince of nothing or maybe not counter-strike.

690
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,289
Rym: Yeah, counter-strike burning wheel.

691
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,720
Rym: We've talked about a lot too, right?

692
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:28,576
Rym: But I mean, come on seriously speaking of which we will soon as soon as we can arrange it We're gonna have tour on GeekNights to talk about torch bear.

693
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:31,814
Scott: torch bear I won't make that joke when he's here cuz that would be.

694
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:35,731
Rym: you will make that joke And I'll go and I don't know if he'll laugh or not.

695
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:41,229
Rym: I think he'll chuckle a little maybe like hey He's such a normal and nice person.

696
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:44,320
Scott: I know not a wacky or crazy or silly person at all.

697

Scott: He's so level-headed.

698

Rym: I'm just really interesting to have my GeekNights.

699
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:56,202
