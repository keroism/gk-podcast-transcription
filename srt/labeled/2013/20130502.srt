1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,895
Rym: It's Thursday, May 2nd, 2013.

2
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:10,357
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:13,884
Scott: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,302
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:17,027
Rym: Camping.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,327
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,739
Rym: So today at work I was killing some downtime on the old tweeters.

8
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:31,800
Rym: And basically Conrad and I came up with a brilliant business proposition.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,520
Rym: And I feel like you could turn this into a real, not so much a business, but at least a funny or cool app.

10
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:38,319
Rym: Okay.

11
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:39,639
Rym: Homeopathic iTunes.

12
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:41,760
Scott: Alright.

13
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,268
Rym: So think about this.

14
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:43,853
Rym: I was making a joke.

15
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:47,919
Scott: They give you money and you give them some bits but it's not an app?

16
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:55,800
Rym: A dude who was selling basically dowsing rods as bomb detectors was arrested and is going to jail for a long time.

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,267
Scott: Hooray!

18
00:00:57,161 --> 00:01:01,220
Rym: So I was musing on why we don't arrest all the other people selling homeoepithes.

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,920
Scott: There's a lot of people selling that kind of shit.

20
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,879
Rym: I know and they should probably all be in jail.

21
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:05,339
Scott: That's right.

22
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:11,500
Rym: But I made some jokes about homeopathy and then kind of realized something.

23
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:17,619
Rym: Say we started selling homeopathic music and the way you do it is...

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,620
Scott: It's like a second of music?

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,540
Rym: It's just iTunes but it gives you just a tiny snippet of music and just a little, maybe even just the cover art.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,040
Rym: And it assumes that if you've seen that music before, you'll remember it and play the song back in your head.

27
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:34,080
Scott: Alright.

28
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,400
Rym: And thus getting a percentage of the effect of listening to the real song.

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:47,339
Rym: Like if I see a picture of Michael Jackson and the word Billie Jean, even just the words Billie Jean, I hear a few pieces of Billie Jean repeating over and over again in my head for like the next 20 minutes.

30
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,200
Rym: So basically homeopathic music kind of works.

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,120
Rym: Or in the very least it works way better than actual homeopathy.

32
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:05,840
Rym: Also Billie Jean is my example because two days now I've gone to the Taco Shed by Brooklyn Bridge.

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,960
Rym: And both times there's been these dudes who hang out and do mediocre breakdancing and they always do the same set.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,240
Rym: Every day at noon they do Gangnam Style and then Billie Jean.

35
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,600
Scott: I was on the train just now and the dancing guys were in the next subway car over.

36
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,379
Scott: I peeped them through the window.

37
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:22,488
Rym: Gangnam Style?

38
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,360
Scott: Billie Jean?

39
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,380
Scott: I couldn't hear their music at all because they were in the next subway car.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,299
Scott: It was a loud subway and I had my headphones in.

41
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:35,420
Scott: They looked real derpy just sort of dancing with no music doing their grab onto the subway bar flipping around stuff.

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,780
Scott: It looked very uncoordinated with no rhythm whatsoever.

43
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:48,200
Rym: Well living in New York, much like how you learn pretty quickly, the majority of people with instruments anywhere in public don't actually know how to play shit.

44
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,360
Rym: And they just kind of doodle enough to where if you walk by and you're not really paying attention, it sounds like they're playing music.

45
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,599
Rym: I think the majority of breakdancers on the streets of New York City are the same way.

46
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:00,931
Rym: So yeah, it's Thursday.

47
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,000
Rym: It's the lounge.

48
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:02,760
Scott: It's your mom.

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,559
Rym: Care to talk about anything on the loan?

50
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:06,334
Rym: No.

51
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,420
Rym: The geek nudge lounge?

52
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,233
Scott: I'm boycotting the lounge.

53
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,387
Rym: It's the lounge.

54
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:10,500
Scott: We just kind of hang out and talk.

55
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,760
Scott: Just stop calling it the lounge.

56
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:14,039
Rym: What are you going to talk about then?

57
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:14,679
Rym: I got nothing.

58
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,179
Scott: No, I got nothing actually.

59
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:17,180
Scott: You really have nothing?

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,908
Scott: There's nothing.

61
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:18,559
Scott: I have a cough.

62
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,280
Scott: I was coughing in the morning.

63
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,038
Scott: I woke up and I was like BK.

64
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:23,340
Scott: Shit.

65
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,980
Rym: I wonder how many Monday listeners know why we say BK instead of bike.

66
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:36,475
Rym: I mean, I remember we got an email from a dude in like 2006 who was like, "Guys, it's pronounced Chipotle, not

67
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:36,979
Rym: Chipotle.".

68
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:39,197
Rym: And we had to be like, "Yeah, we

69
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:39,500
Rym: know.".

70
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,120
Scott: Yeah, it's also Clash of the Titans.

71
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,640
Rym: So you admit that it's actually Titans and that you just do that because it's funny.

72
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,457
Scott: What did I just say?

73
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,560
Rym: All right, Scott.

74
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,860
Rym: So what's the name of the song?

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,592
Rym: I believe it's "Have You Never Been

76
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:51,915
Rym: Mellow?".

77
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:53,940
Scott: What song are you talking about?

78
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,717
Rym: The song in DDR, "Have You Never Been

79
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:55,960
Rym: Mellow?".

80
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,838
Scott: I've never heard of that song.

81
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,159
Rym: I see what's going on here.

82
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,140
Rym: So I got something I want to talk about.

83
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,400
Scott: I actually just listened to that song today.

84
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:05,659
Rym: I just danced to that song a few days ago.

85
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,559
Rym: DDR is my thing.

86
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:09,380
Scott: I'm in a DDR mood, do not deny.

87
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:20,620
Rym: For those of you who weren't alive and conscious enough in the '90s, the '80s to remember this, let alone people are old enough to remember actual anarchists.

88
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:35,899
Rym: May Day is a day every year where basically morons in Western countries will, and particularly in places like Seattle, Toronto- California, all of it.

89
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,160
Rym: Will basically protest nothing.

90
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:40,977
Scott: Yep.

91
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:41,898
Scott: The man.

92
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,700
Scott: It's people- They're protesting the man.

93
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,840
Rym: Who are ostensibly anarchists of some stripe, or maybe they're anti-corporatists or whatever.

94
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,140
Rym: They're all the same kinds of people with the same weirdo talking points.

95
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,699
Rym: Like, take the people who did Occupy Wall Street and go one step crazier.

96
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,339
Rym: Exactly one step.

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,679
Scott: It doesn't really get crazier than contrail guy.

98
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:04,920
Rym: Yeah, well, chemtrail guy is way beyond all of that.

99
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,860
Rym: It's like a separate spectrum.

100
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,720
Rym: But there's a particular class of people who will do the Occupy thing in that kind of derpy way that they do their thing.

101
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:14,980
Rym: One step beyond that is the self-described anarchist.

102
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,320
Rym: Basically, it's the equivalent of hipsters who pretend to be into politics and live on the West Coast.

103
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:24,040
Scott: They're really about equivalent to Ron Paul guy in my book.

104
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:29,800
Rym: Yeah, I've never understood what they actually want, what they're actually after.

105
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,619
Rym: Don't think they know about anarchy.

106
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,920
Rym: At best, they're like the anarchists in Chesterton's book, The Man Who Was Thursday.

107
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,960
Scott: Right, they're basically anti-current society and they just want to fight against it.

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,660
Scott: So the first thing that comes along that is a replacement, they latch onto it and that's their thing.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,540
Rym: But what's even funnier is that one step beyond them are the guys who are "anarchists" in quotes.

110
00:05:53,241 --> 00:06:06,660
Rym: But they pretend to be old-timey anarchists and they actually wear bandanas and are ready to fight the cops and basically provoke fights with riot police without fail every year on May 1st.

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:20,670
Rym: And every time there's a G7 or a WTO conference, they show up, they break a bunch of windows of Starbuckses, they try to flip over cars, as soon as the police come anywhere near them, they start screaming, "The man, the man, they're getting me!

112
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,918
Rym: I'm going to sue you for arresting

113
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:21,999
Rym: me!".

114
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,491
Rym: Blah, blah, blah.

115
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:25,880
Rym: And in the 90s, this was always in the news.

116
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,640
Rym: It's basically not in the news anymore.

117
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:33,920
Rym: My news is just to show people who don't pay attention that this still happens.

118
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:49,109
Rym: And it's kind of hilarious because at least in the 80s and in the early to mid-90s, because there wasn't an internet like we know today, this stuff would make the mainstream news and you could kind of understand at least.

119
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,940
Rym: these are people who have a thing and this is the only way they can get attention.

120
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:59,000
Rym: But there's really no excuse for this bullshit anymore and no one sides with them at all anymore.

121
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,230
Scott: Well, they side with themselves.

122
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,059
Scott: There's more than one of them.

123
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,805
Scott: There's not just one guy.

124
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:06,260
Scott: There's still these two guys and they side with each other, so that's who sides with them.

125
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,720
Rym: To quote one of them, "They're just doing what they need to do to stand up for ourselves.

126
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,555
Rym: These are our streets and we have the right to take

127
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:12,797
Rym: them."

128
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,820
Rym: Says the guy who basically breaks some Starbucks windows and then screams that he's getting arrested.

129
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,080
Scott: I don't think you have a right to break the Starbucks windows.

130
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,540
Scott: The Starbucks window is not part of the streets.

131
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:30,260
Rym: So, if you're not aware of this subculture, take a gander at this article because the headlining picture says everything.

132
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,678
Rym: Two totally normal police, but because it's Seattle, they're bicycle police and they're just dragging away.

133
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:49,940
Rym: this guy who looks like he deserves to be dragged away and/or tased and has the exact face that people like this tend to have when they're being arrested for doing their absolutely nothing wrong that they were doing.

134
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,805
Rym: So, that's all I got to say.

135
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:54,500
Rym: If you're not aware of these morons, this is all kind of funny.

136
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,420
Rym: And this is coming from someone who thinks we should be doing protests for things like this, but actually about real things.

137
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,585
Scott: What are they protesting even?

138
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:04,213
Scott: They're just protesting the man.

139
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,800
Scott: They don't have a specific thing.

140
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,400
Rym: Protesters began throwing metal rods and water bottles at officers and business windows.

141
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:13,760
Rym: And then the officers walked in and just started arresting them.

142
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,710
Scott: In protest, you gotta be Gandhi style.

143
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,720
Scott: If you're throwing shit, it's like, well, fuck you.

144
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:25,660
Rym: You can throw shit in certain situations, but I can even rationalize certain kinds of violent protests.

145
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:37,159
Rym: However, that's neither here nor there because nothing related to the May 1st WTO anti-globalization protest for the last 20+ years has been even close to reasonable.

146
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:38,957
Scott: No.

147
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:39,200
Scott: Alright.

148
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:46,290
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

149
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,740
Rym: I used to be a big fan of these sort of things.

150
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:59,879
Rym: Especially in the early anime-con days, like the fake trailer to a movie, like the fake trailer to Evangelion, or take a movie trailer and mash it up with an anime or something like that.

151
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,360
Rym: This is a gritty movie trailer, and these people seem to have done several, but this one's probably the best one.

152
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,940
Rym: Basically, they make fake movie trailers that are the gritty reboot of X. Because that seems to be what Hollywood does lately.

153
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:15,900
Scott: And you do a gritty reboot of something that's already gritty?

154
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,683
Rym: That'd be pretty cool.

155
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,332
Rym: Well, you know what?

156
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:20,740
Rym: I would do a gritty reboot of Batman.

157
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,634
Rym: It's just Batman going, "I'm not the hero that Gotham

158
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:24,358
Rym: wants!".

159
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:26,326
Rym: And then it's just him, Hannibal Lecter.

160
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:30,160
Rym: Anyway, this is a gritty reboot of Calvin and Hobbes.

161
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:42,360
Rym: And the reason I make this my thing of the day is that it's not only well done and apt in many ways, but if this were a real movie, I would actually consider watching it once it came to Netflix.

162
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,213
Scott: Calvin and Hobbes mixes seem to be very popular lately.

163
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:54,520
Scott: I mean, they've been popular always, but lately, I think the frequency in which new ones appear has been increasing steadily.

164
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,419
Rym: I think it's partly because the people who grew up reading Calvin and Hobbes all have money and professional lives now.

165
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:01,786
Rym: And media production got easier.

166
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:08,219
Rym: And you can't make anything legit related to Calvin and Hobbes, but you can totally make parodies!

167
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,702
Scott: Alright.

168
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:10,824
Scott: So check this out, right?

169
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:24,880
Scott: Normally, if you're the kind of person who makes models or miniatures or anything like that, it requires a lot of careful skills to do good stuff, right?

170
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:32,680
Scott: So it's like, if you got a Gundam or something, you gotta airbrush each piece, and carefully mask off different parts and draw the panel lines.

171
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:39,640
Scott: Or if you're like a Warhammer, you gotta get a really pointy brush and paint some eyeballs on your orc or whatever, right?

172
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:44,460
Scott: It's all about this careful, high skill, lots of practice kind of work.

173
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,420
Scott: So this guy here has the greatest method of putting damage.

174
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,151
Scott: Damage is a thing that you want to do pretty often, right?

175
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:54,899
Scott: You want to make a guy look like he got hurt.

176
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,779
Scott: Especially if it's something involved in a battle, right?

177
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,620
Scott: Or maybe you even want to do a car model and make it look like it crashed.

178
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:06,080
Scott: See, he has a Gundam, and he wants to make it look like it's been in a battle.

179
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,516
Scott: He does this in the least skilled way I've ever seen.

180
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:12,420
Scott: I could even do it.

181
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:16,060
Scott: And it comes out better looking than almost anything I've seen.

182
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,900
Scott: All you have to do after you do his method is basically spray a topcoat on it to seal in the damage so that it doesn't rub off.

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,534
Scott: But he has this amazing method of making the kit look damaged.

184
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:30,440
Scott: that is trivially simple.

185
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:32,899
Scott: If you've never built a Gundam model before, you can do this.

186
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,780
Scott: And it looks like a pro did it all carefully by hand.

187
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,940
Scott: So really, anyone who's doing this sort of damage look by hand, you're fucking stupid.

188
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,320
Scott: You can just do it this way, and it comes out looking better and more natural.

189
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:46,280
Rym: Not too shabby.

190
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:50,614
Rym: In the meantime, the GeekNights Book Club book is Player of Games by Ian M.

191
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:50,855
Scott: Banks.

192
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,260
Rym: I will start reading it today.

193
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:53,764
Scott: You know what?

194
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:54,638
Scott: There's a guy in the book.

195
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:55,539
Rym: Let me guess.

196
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,380
Scott: He plays a lot of motherfucking games.

197
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:57,987
Rym: Scott, spoilers.

198
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,680
Rym: Jesus fuck.

199
00:11:59,189 --> 00:11:59,739
Scott: And you know what?

200
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,616
Scott: Even though he plays many different games, mostly there's just one game.

201
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,440
Scott: he plays a whole lot.

202
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:07,039
Scott: But that game has a lot of sub-games.

203
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,640
Rym: You know, it'd be funny if that game was just Counter-Strike.

204
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:11,640
Scott: No, it's a fictional made-up game.

205
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,920
Scott: It might as well be Benjuka.

206
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,680
Scott: It's basically Benjuka.

207
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,360
Scott: Only they describe it a little bit more, but not totally.

208
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,330
Rym: Alright.

209
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,060
Rym: So we uploaded numerous recent lectures from Penny Arcade Expos and the likes.

210
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,679
Rym: You should check out our YouTube channels.

211
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:28,318
Rym: I'll link to them in the thing.

212
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:34,700
Rym: We're going to be at, coming up very soon, Anime Boston doing not one, not two, not three, not four, but five lectures.

213
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:37,480
Rym: And Emily will also be doing a lecture.

214
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,920
Rym: We're doing a ton of crap there.

215
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,200
Rym: Anime Boston's going to be awesome.

216
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,240
Rym: In the time we're not doing them, we'll either be in the tabletop area or out on Newbury Street eating expensive food.

217
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:50,360
Scott: Or coughing and sneezing or barfing if it's Anime Boston.

218
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,800
Rym: Not too long after that, we will be at ConnectiCon helping run and running the panels and workshops department and doing panels and lectures.

219
00:12:57,501 --> 00:13:10,040
Rym: And then immediately after that, Scott and I are flying to Land Out Under to present Beyond Dungeons and Dragons 2.0 version beta, all new content at PAX Australia.

220
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:10,840
Scott: Okay.

221
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,158
Rym: I'm pretty excited about this.

222
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:16,040
Rym: And then of course, we're going to be at PAX Dev and PAX Prime and then MAGFest.

223
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:16,939
Scott: Oh yeah.

224
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:17,412
Scott: Yeah.

225
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:22,580
Rym: And we did not submit any panels to Otakon after three years of being blacklisted officially.

226
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,740
Rym: We're not going to bother even trying to submit any words.

227
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:26,919
Rym: Clearly they don't want us there.

228
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,240
Rym: So if you want us at Otakon, tell them, because it's obvious that us submitting panels.

229
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,260
Scott: Take over Otakon.

230
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:34,458
Rym: Yeah, guys.

231
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,318
Rym: Join the staff.

232
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,979
Rym: Take over.

233
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,600
Rym: That's how we took over ConnectiCon.

234
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,275
Rym: It's working out pretty well.

235
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,779
Scott: Not going too badly.

236
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:44,620
Scott: Uh, any other meta things?

237
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,338
Rym: No more meta?

238
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,580
Scott: I know the backgammon round of the Grand Prix is almost over.

239
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,400
Scott: Another round will begin soon.

240
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,659
Scott: Not too many people participated in the backgammon round, even though it went pretty well.

241
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,300
Scott: Relatively speaking, the next round is going to be much easier and more straightforward.

242
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,320
Rym: You know, I would have participated in the whole Grand Prix.

243
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,320
Rym: The only reason I didn't is that you had a wall of text that I didn't fully read.

244
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,600
Rym: So I missed the registration.

245
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:07,640
Scott: Well, that's important.

246
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,220
Scott: That's part of the thing is if you want to, you have to read the fucking rules.

247
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,559
Rym: And I wasn't willing to do that.

248
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,500
Rym: So I'm completely out.

249
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,400
Rym: I'm not going to participate.

250
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,439
Scott: Just at all?

251
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:14,708
Scott: No.

252
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,780
Scott: You missed one round.

253
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,040
Rym: I pretty much said that as soon as I was like, Hey, is it too late?

254
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:19,478
Rym: You were like, yep.

255
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,718
Rym: And I'm like, well, I'm out of the Grand Prix.

256
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:22,979
Rym: I have the chat log to show it, to prove it.

257
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,126
Rym: What?

258
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:25,219
Scott: You think you can't come back?

259
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:26,440
Rym: I just don't really care.

260
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,160
Rym: It's not, I wouldn't have even had time or effort to do the backgammon round.

261
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,798
Scott: Apparently you didn't even have time or effort to read something, which takes about a minute to read.

262
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:35,000
Scott: So you didn't care that much to begin with.

263
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:36,759
Rym: No, by the time I read it, it was already too late.

264
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,699
Scott: Why didn't you read it as soon as I put it there?

265
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,839
Rym: Partly because I was busy.

266
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,959
Scott: You know, it doesn't take long to read things.

267
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,520
Rym: Sometimes it does.

268
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:53,000
Scott: It seems like I'm the only person in the world who like reads things as soon as they're posted and reads them really, really quickly and reads all the words.

269
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:56,260
Rym: I only actually read our forum once or twice a day at most.

270
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,239
Rym: I don't read every thread.

271
00:14:57,901 --> 00:15:02,323
Scott: I don't read every thread, but if there's something I want to read, I'm constantly checking it.

272
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:06,239
Scott: And I read it completely and really, really quickly, like whoosh.

273
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:10,379
Scott: And I read like tons and tons of things really fast all the time.

274
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:11,840
Scott: I don't know why.

275
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:16,460
Scott: And it's weird that no one else does this because basically it's like, why I know all these things.

276
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,299
Scott: No one knows these things.

277
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:22,340
Rym: I mean, I think it's good for you because I know about things that matter and I don't know about things that don't matter.

278
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:26,100
Rym: This is why I don't use things like Google Reader because that's more data than I need.

279
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,200
Scott: I don't use Google Reader either, but it's useless.

280
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:30,739
Scott: I'll read boing boing and I'll just whoosh.

281
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,400
Scott: And I can just scroll down the page in like 30 seconds and basically get all the headlines.

282
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,060
Rym: I do the same thing, but you know what I do that with Google News.

283
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,879
Scott: I do with Google News also.

284
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:47,840
Scott: Yeah, I can basically read like many, many websites just like tab whoosh, tab whoosh, tab whoosh, tab whoosh in like a minute.

285
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:54,059
Scott: And then if there's articles I wanted, I already clicked on them to open a tab and it takes me about a minute per article to read all the words.

286
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:54,678
Rym: Good for you.

287
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,000
Rym: What I'm saying is, yes, that's a common skill.

288
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:59,820
Rym: I simply don't consume the same things you consume.

289
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:01,999
Scott: But then it's like, but that is you.

290
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:03,638
Scott: You know, you miss the thing.

291
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:04,536
Rym: I miss the thing.

292
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:06,020
Rym: You miss a lot of things.

293
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,979
Rym: I think you're missing my unstated point.

294
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,440
Rym: Wasn't super into the thing to begin with, so I didn't read it right away.

295
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,659
Rym: I only read things I'm super into right away.

296
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:16,359
Scott: I'm super into everything all the time.

297
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:16,932
Rym: Are you?

298
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,399
Rym: You're into everything all the time.

299
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:19,560
Scott: What don't I know?

300
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,479
Rym: Why didn't you bike today?

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,640
Scott: Because I'm coughing.

302
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,778
Rym: So you're not super into biking right now.

303
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,060
Scott: If you cared about it, you would have biked.

304
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,560
Scott: I tried to bike and then I went outside and I was like, I went back inside.

305
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:30,406
Rym: Uh huh.

306
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:32,859
Rym: Anyway, so camping.

307
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:36,160
Rym: I had a bunch of, I want to talk about transhumanism.

308
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:37,880
Rym: I got these great show ideas.

309
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,879
Rym: What do you say about transhumanism?

310
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,698
Scott: You got nothing to say.

311
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,560
Rym: I got about an hour's worth of discussion.

312
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,339
Scott: I don't have anything to say.

313
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,580
Rym: You seem to forget that, especially on Thursday episodes, listeners don't really care about our specific direct opinions.

314
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,380
Scott: Listeners aren't even listening to this stupid show.

315
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,840
Rym: Or are open, you know, like, oh, let's expound for an hour.

316
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,600
Scott: Nobody listens to this podcast.

317
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,740
Rym: Yeah, yeah, whatever.

318
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,399
Rym: Your self-deprecating act is kind of old.

319
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,960
Rym: You just say the same things over and over again.

320
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,477
Scott: That is true.

321
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:03,059
Scott: As opposed to yourself aggrandizing act.

322
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:04,400
Rym: What did I say right now?

323
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,118
Rym: We have at least one listener.

324
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:09,378
Rym: So I think I could least extrapolate from that, that there are two.

325
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,099
Rym: So it is okay for me to estimate that I can say listeners.

326
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:21,060
Scott: If you say that because there's one listener, there must be two listeners, then you might as well be, you might get extrapolated as infinity listeners.

327
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,359
Rym: No, because one, the difference between one and two, I mean, look, one, two, three, many.

328
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,699
Rym: So I think there's one of those four.

329
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:30,098
Scott: I think there's one listener.

330
00:17:31,804 --> 00:17:32,120
Rym: Anyway.

331
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:37,400
Rym: So as a result, the thing is, you see what I'm doing there, right?

332
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,138
Rym: Right.

333
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:39,500
Scott: The thing is, right.

334
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,139
Scott: Suffice to say the thing is right, you know.

335
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:53,260
Rym: But no, I think the person who does listen to this show is more interested in the banter than in the expounding opinion, especially on Thursday topics.

336
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,800
Scott: That's why we just spent like a good minute, not even completely dodging our topic and killing time saying right, you know.

337
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:01,460
Rym: That if we may, if we pick a topic, that's just some bullshit.

338
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,297
Rym: We'll just bullshit for an hour.

339
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,999
Rym: We're just bullshitting right now.

340
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,696
Scott: We're not saying anything.

341
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,579
Rym: The way we talk.

342
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,300
Scott: Everyone who's the one listener already stopped listening at this point.

343
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,859
Rym: This is their favorite shit.

344
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,598
Scott: No, it's not.

345
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,779
Rym: Listeners, tell us.

346
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Rym: This is the worst shit.

347
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:18,198
Rym: Every time I have ever turned to the listener and asked him or her what he likes.

348
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,999
Rym: We always get like one email that's like, actually, I really liked the episode you did about blah.

349
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,179
Rym: I don't know why Scott was so down on it.

350
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:28,380
Rym: That's what the listener sounds like.

351
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:30,100
Scott: That listener is pretty sad.

352
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,080
Scott: You should be listening to some better podcast or doing something else with your time.

353
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:35,879
Scott: If you're listening to this right now, that is sad.

354
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,780
Rym: Anyway, guy, would you like us to talk about transhumanism?

355
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,959
Scott: What do we have to say about it?

356
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,431
Rym: Or the surveillance society?

357
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:43,499
Rym: or urination?

358
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,760
Scott: We've already discussed that.

359
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,920
Rym: Because we already did a show on pooping.

360
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,139
Rym: So urination was also a topic.

361
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,700
Scott: There's a lot less to say about urination than that.

362
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,160
Rym: I got a lot to say about urination, but Scott wants nothing to do with these topics.

363
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:53,459
Scott: I got nothing to say.

364
00:18:54,002 --> 00:19:02,720
Rym: So I've realized that a lot of people I know in the real world have never, ever in their lives been camping in any capacity.

365
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,740
Scott: A lot of these people might be urban peoples.

366
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,578
Rym: But not all of them by any stretch.

367
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:15,778
Scott: A lot of them are suburban peoples who just don't leave society and go to the woods or anything.

368
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:31,180
Rym: Well, I've realized something because I was kind of thinking about this in light of, for example, the fact that I would say the majority of people I know, until recently, if not currently still don't, don't actually know how to use gears on bikes.

369
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,759
Scott: It's just a common thing.

370
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,500
Scott: Yesterday, when I was biking up the bridge, there was some girl and she was going in the highest possible gear.

371
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:42,718
Scott: And I was actually like, "Hey, you should use some

372
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:43,100
Scott: gears.".

373
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,178
Scott: And she actually wasn't like, "Damn, don't tell me what to do,

374
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:46,540
Scott: whatever.".

375
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:47,348
Scott: She was actually like, "Oh,

376
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:47,874
Scott: okay.".

377
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:49,074
Rym: Did she?

378
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,425
Rym: Yeah.

379
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:50,858
Scott: She did.

380
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,757
Rym: She asked her out.

381
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,138
Scott: No, she wasn't.

382
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,519
Scott: I could tell that she was sort of like, "Oh my gosh.

383
00:19:57,944 --> 00:19:58,251
Scott: Let me see

384
00:19:58,271 --> 00:19:58,640
Scott: something.".

385
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,680
Rym: So just like Rainbow Dash?

386
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:00,443
Scott: No.

387
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,912
Rym: Different kind of, "Oh my

388
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:02,218
Rym: gosh."

389
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,892
Rym: Like, "Let me see

390
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:03,219
Rym: something.".

391
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:12,920
Rym: But I realized that the reason I knew how to shift gears, and I can't say... It's not to fault people who don't because it seems like it's the vast majority of people.

392
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:24,000
Rym: I mean, I just found this article talking about how with all these new bike paths in New York City and the Citi Bike Program, there's classes for adults who never learned how to ride a bike to learn how to ride a bike without being embarrassed.

393
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:31,859
Rym: There's semi-private classes and they're stupidly popular and there's a whole industry now in teaching adults how to ride bikes.

394
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:34,899
Rym: Then they're teaching like, "Don't fall over.

395
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,478
Rym: Don't fall over.

396
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,257
Rym: Let's take the training wheels off

397
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:38,460
Rym: now.".

398
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,040
Rym: They're not teaching advanced shifting techniques.

399
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:44,139
Scott: Not everyone grew up riding a bike.

400
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:46,840
Rym: But even the people who grew up riding a bike often don't know how to shift.

401
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:58,378
Rym: I think the only reason I knew how to shift was that I grew up in a family that had a culture of bicycle riding together in groups and going to the woods and biking through the woods.

402
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,558
Scott: You know how I knew how to shift?

403
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,060
Scott: I had it when I was a kid.

404
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,720
Scott: I had a tricycle.

405
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,180
Scott: Then I had a two-wheel bike with training wheels.

406
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,797
Rym: BMX bike?

407
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:06,382
Scott: No.

408
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,653
Scott: It was just sort of a little bike.

409
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,039
Scott: Regular bike.

410
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,959
Rym: No gear shifting.

411
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,719
Rym: Coaster brake?

412
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,333
Scott: Yep.

413
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,620
Scott: But it was, you know, two wheels, whatever.

414
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,500
Rym: Most kids get what is effectively a BMX bike, even if they don't use it for the things that BMX bikes are often used for.

415
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,480
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't BMX bike.

416
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,117
Scott: But then, you know, I was biking it.

417
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:26,160
Scott: Then, you know, I got too big for that shit, so I got a 10-speed bike.

418
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,756
Scott: I was like, "Oh, what do these buttons do and switches and

419
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:30,118
Scott: things?".

420
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:36,020
Scott: I looked at the gears and then I've moved them all around and figured out how they worked on my own.

421
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,639
Scott: I'm just like, "This thing's here.

422
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,199
Scott: Clearly, there is a reason for these things to be here.

423
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:42,578
Scott: I will push them all around to figure it

424
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:42,759
Scott: out.".

425
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:48,678
Scott: Then I was like, "Oh, if I use these ones, it's harder to pedal, but I go faster if I can pedal.

426
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:52,596
Scott: If I go this way, it's easy to pedal, so I can go up a hill real

427
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:52,938
Scott: easy.".

428
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:57,900
Scott: It was just my natural curiosity and exploration of doing things.

429
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:04,219
Scott: I noticed there's a different kind of mentality that some people have where they just don't want to touch things.

430
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:06,137
Scott: They say, "Leave it

431
00:22:06,177 --> 00:22:06,380
Scott: there.".

432
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:09,560
Rym: I think there's one other factor with biking in particular.

433
00:22:09,741 --> 00:22:13,120
Rym: I think it's an anti-intellectual attitude that I do not like.

434
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:20,669
Rym: No, because with biking specifically, it's the fact that most people don't bike in ways that even really need the gears.

435
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,100
Rym: unless you live in the city.

436
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,620
Scott: If there is a hill at all, unless you live somewhere that's 100% flat or on a beach.

437
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,520
Rym: There aren't hills in Michigan at all.

438
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:33,438
Scott: Not even one hill?

439
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:39,220
Rym: It is literally, if you bike in Southeast Michigan, completely flat.

440
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,604
Scott: 100% flat?

441
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,450
Rym: Yes, effectively 100% flat.

442
00:22:43,184 --> 00:22:44,600
Scott: Even right next to my house.

443
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,640
Scott: You know what's right next to my house?

444
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,160
Scott: That road.

445
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,600
Scott: You know that road to hell.

446
00:22:48,507 --> 00:22:49,119
Scott: Nothing but hills.

447
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,416
Rym: As a kid, I learned how to use gears and everyone in my family knew how to use gears, but most people I knew didn't.

448
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,240
Rym: The difference was we went biking out in the woods on trails where there were- Hills?

449
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:03,819
Rym: There were basically hills.

450
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,840
Rym: Because you're out in the woods, there's hills there.

451
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,779
Scott: See, even if I had been somewhere totally flat, I still would have messed around with the gears and figured out what they did.

452
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,580
Rym: Oh no, a lot of people messed around with the gears, but they never fully grokked how to use them.

453
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:29,239
Rym: Or even if they grok how to use them, not grok, but they get how to use them in a basic sense, what they don't get is the kind of subtle things that require a little bit of mastery, like exactly how to let up on pressure to shift and then start going again on and uphill.

454
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,389
Scott: Well, if you have a certain kind of gears, you don't need to let off the pressure to shift.

455
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,660
Rym: You don't have those gears.

456
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,758
Scott: Yeah, actually I do.

457
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,380
Rym: No, you don't.

458
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,960
Rym: You cannot maintain full pressure going up a hill and downshifts.

459
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:42,460
Scott: It depends.

460
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,939
Rym: If you do that, you're basically going to cause a little wear on your gears in the log run and/or fuck your chain up.

461
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:54,976
Scott: There's one kind of gear that the teeth are different shapes, so you can shift while you're pedaling versus stop pedaling and then shift.

462
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,900
Rym: Yeah, I can shift while I'm pedaling, but you still let up on the pressure.

463
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,760
Scott: If you're full force pressure, it's all about the tensioning thing at the bottom.

464
00:24:00,868 --> 00:24:01,040
Scott: Right.

465
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:05,140
Scott: Even then, if that is the limit, then you're in trouble.

466
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:06,140
Scott: But not even then.

467
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,439
Rym: You let up on the pressure slightly whenever you shift.

468
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:10,640
Scott: I've never had any problem.

469
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:18,397
Rym: You're probably not pushing too hard anyway, but it's because I also usually downshift before I get to a hill.

470
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:19,939
Scott: Not on the hill.

471
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,440
Rym: Yes, but if you're going to shift on the hill, you often will.

472
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:31,659
Rym: For example, I'm in a certain gear, going up the Williamsburg Bridge, jackasses on fixies are blocking the entire way and I have to slow down.

473
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:33,859
Rym: Now I need to downshift on the hill.

474
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,240
Rym: And that happens every morning.

475
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,020
Scott: Don't have that problem.

476
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,180
Rym: Yeah, bike over the Williamsburg Bridge in the morning.

477
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,120
Rym: There's like a hundred assholes walking fixies up the bridge in both directions.

478
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:43,759
Scott: Come on, cops.

479
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,560
Scott: Do something about it.

480
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,300
Rym: It's not illegal.

481
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,200
Scott: It should be illegal to have a fixie on the streets.

482
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,900
Rym: It should be illegal to have a fixie on the streets.

483
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,480
Rym: It should not be illegal to have a single gear bike.

484
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:52,259
Rym: That's just dumb.

485
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:52,491
Rym: Yeah.

486
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,276
Rym: If you see a single gear bike, you smile and nod like, oh, yeah.

487
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,660
Rym: But if you see a fixie, it's like seeing a drunk driver.

488
00:24:58,827 --> 00:24:59,038
Rym: Exactly.

489
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:00,460
Rym: Anyway, not the bike show.

490
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,420
Rym: My point is with camping.

491
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,499
Rym: Everyone I know who knows how to camp and has camped grew up in a family culture of family camping trips.

492
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:19,500
Rym: Everyone I know who has never camped and does not know how to camp did never, never went on a family camping trip because their family was not into camp.

493
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:25,007
Scott: Our family did not have a culture of camping, but we had a culture of send kids to summer camp, which I mean,

494
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,389
Rym: like

495
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:34,860
Scott: when I was a kid, I sort of assumed everyone went to summer camp and only later in life did I realize, oh, only some people send their kids to summer camp and most people fucking don't because they're stupid as shit.

496
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,879
Scott: Now, the thing is, there's a different can't afford it.

497
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,740
Rym: There's a different world in the Midwest.

498
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:41,960
Rym: The stuff of summer camp is just in the neighborhood.

499
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:45,540
Scott: There are neighborhood summer camps you can go to, but you don't need to go away to camp.

500
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,040
Rym: You just there's just shooting ranges.

501
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,700
Rym: You just go to as kids in the summer and just shoot and there's just archery ranges.

502
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,259
Rym: You just go to just fuck around in the woods and whatever.

503
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:57,380
Rym: So you didn't need to go to camp to get those experiences.

504
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,819
Scott: Summer camp is his own thing.

505
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,460
Rym: Yeah, I know you just got you're saying that.

506
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:08,140
Rym: What I'm going to say is that the most people I know for whom summer camp was a thing, like a thing as opposed to just, yeah, I went to summer camp once or twice.

507
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:12,460
Rym: Our kids grew up in Connecticut and New York and New Jersey and almost nowhere else.

508
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,393
Scott: It's a Northeast thing.

509
00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:13,799
Scott: I don't know.

510
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,264
Scott: It is.

511
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,260
Rym: I go to the Midwest.

512
00:26:15,382 --> 00:26:16,218
Rym: It's not a big thing.

513
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:19,120
Rym: Kids generally don't go to summer camp.

514
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:19,585
Scott: They will.

515
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:20,379
Scott: Summer camp is the best.

516
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:28,684
Rym: They'll go to like week long camps like space camp or science camp or Starbase or programmer camp, but they won't go to.

517
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:32,560
Rym: I am away from home for more than a couple of weeks.

518
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,652
Scott: Eight weeks sleep away camp is should.

519
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:35,740
Scott: every kid should have that.

520
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,660
Scott: In fact, it should be sort of like public school.

521
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,000
Scott: We should have public sleep away camp for eight weeks every summer.

522
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,582
Rym: I don't know.

523
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:42,780
Rym: I think you're too close to it because you grew up in a culture of that.

524
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,836
Scott: Summer camp is the best.

525
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:47,160
Rym: Did not exist where I grew up and I frankly don't think I miss much.

526
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,005
Scott: It's the best.

527
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:49,200
Scott: You missed a lot more than you realize.

528
00:26:49,462 --> 00:26:49,660
Rym: Like what?

529
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:51,240
Scott: It's pretty much the greatest.

530
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,920
Scott: That's, you know, there's not this night.

531
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,120
Scott: So like you watch freakin, um, salute your shorts.

532
00:26:59,181 --> 00:27:04,020
Rym: That looks like a horrible existence that I would have avoided at all costs.

533
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:12,439
Rym: My summers were fuck around in the woods with my own friends, uh, fuck around in my computer, in my house, play video games.

534
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:22,840
Scott: Hey, you know, uh, my summer at the summer camp was, you know, capture the flag with the entire summer camp with all, all hundred plus kids.

535
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:27,100
Rym: We do that with like the like dozens of kids in the woods on our own.

536
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:30,820
Rym: We play softball every Sunday just with a whole bunch of people, two full teams.

537
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,780
Scott: Yeah, but that's, see, this is the thing, right?

538
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:34,799
Scott: You played softball every Sunday, two full teams.

539
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:36,680
Scott: This is, you're there for eight weeks.

540
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:42,520
Scott: This goes on for 24 hours a day, every day for eight weeks, nonstop awesomeness.

541
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,286
Scott: Right?

542
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:52,500
Scott: It's like you play capture the flag in the woods with 200 kids and then immediately after you're playing D and D and then immediately after it's like nonstop.

543
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,759
Rym: So I would play it.

544
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,358
Rym: My summers are mostly like that.

545
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,179
Scott: There's only sleeping stops.

546
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,997
Scott: That's pretty much it.

547
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:00,700
Rym: Plus it was that and I had access to my computer.

548
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,819
Scott: Go put it in the lake.

549
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
Rym: I think we, didn't we do a show on summer camp?

550
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,060
Rym: I'm talking more about camping, actual camping.

551
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,406
Scott: Well, that's part of summer camp.

552
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:17,179
Scott: also is when you're at summer camp, you know, you stay in a cabin most of the time, but you're guaranteed to have at least one camping where you grab all the tents and you go out into the woods.

553
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,860
Rym: How far, I'm so curious.

554
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,279
Rym: So there's degrees of camping.

555
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:20,940
Scott: It depends.

556
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,140
Scott: It depends on the summer camp.

557
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:30,720
Rym: So you personally, so the one degree is you go, you're basically take a camper or something or stay in a lodge or log cabin somewhere.

558
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:32,740
Scott: Well, that's summer camp default, right?

559
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,878
Rym: So I've done that.

560
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,220
Scott: Yeah, that doesn't even really count.

561
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,819
Scott: That's like you're in a house just in the woods.

562
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,940
Rym: There's you go a trivial distance from a place like that and set up tents.

563
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,300
Scott: I did that when I was a counselor, you know, and I had little kids.

564
00:28:46,502 --> 00:28:48,480
Scott: So basically that was the camping that we did with that.

565
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:57,339
Rym: There's you hike a significant distance into the woods camp and then possibly continue on from that and set up a second camp.

566
00:28:57,663 --> 00:28:58,579
Scott: I've done that as well.

567
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:05,960
Scott: When I was in the camp, when I was in the summer camp, we hiked and we passed the Hicks house and the Hicks had a natural spring and we drank their water.

568
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,260
Scott: And it was like an adventure.

569
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,100
Scott: And we went over the out of the valley.

570
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,760
Scott: The camp was into the next valley.

571
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:13,899
Scott: And then we went to the second valley and then we came to valleys back.

572
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,740
Rym: Yeah, there's doing that in the winter.

573
00:29:18,622 --> 00:29:21,200
Scott: I didn't do it in the winter, but I did it in the desert.

574
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:21,944
Scott: All right.

575
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:24,120
Rym: So what was the desert camp like the desert of Israel?

576
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,601
Scott: Yeah.

577
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:27,820
Scott: You walk all day next to a camel.

578
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,840
Scott: You drink a lot of water.

579
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:32,619
Scott: You keep walking, lots of walking, looking at desert shit.

580
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:39,040
Scott: And then eventually you get when the sun goes down, you sort of sleep in the desert.

581
00:29:39,522 --> 00:29:41,319
Scott: And but the thing is, you sleep.

582
00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:43,499
Scott: It's like a company did it, I guess.

583
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,340
Scott: So basically they had these pre-prepared sleeping places.

584
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:49,160
Scott: And it wasn't like it was some sort of shelter that you were sleeping in.

585
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,381
Scott: Right.

586
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:51,700
Scott: It was pretty much the middle of the desert.

587
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,741
Scott: They had a spot that they had lights installed so that those scorpions would bite you at night.

588
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:56,123
Scott: Yeah.

589
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:59,705
Rym: And actually even like hiking on the Adirondack Trail or whatever, it's kind of the same thing.

590
00:29:59,745 --> 00:30:01,259
Rym: But they'll be like, you'll hike and hike and hike.

591
00:30:01,662 --> 00:30:09,460
Rym: And occasionally there'll be these shelters, but I say in quotes because they're basically just a slightly raised platform of semi rotten logs.

592
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,304
Rym: Yeah.

593
00:30:10,646 --> 00:30:13,020
Scott: I was sleeping in a sleeping bag on the sand.

594
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:14,027
Scott: And that was it.

595
00:30:14,107 --> 00:30:15,960
Scott: Except for lights that would keep bugs away.

596
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,174
Rym: I'm really I'm actually a fan.

597
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:23,840
Rym: Like I like doing sort of death march hiking's that don't necessarily involve camping.

598
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:31,179
Rym: Like let's go to a trailhead hike for like 30 miles and then end up back at a place where Carl take us back to the hotel.

599
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:35,460
Rym: But I also like the thing where you like hike, you get to a trailhead with all your shit.

600
00:30:35,922 --> 00:30:38,060
Rym: You hike like a whole day out somewhere.

601
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:42,782
Rym: You set up a base camp and then every day you do hikes out from the base camp to other places.

602
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:48,948
Rym: Maybe you like bring a pup tent and you sleep like out one night at a secondary camp away from the base camp.

603
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:51,222
Rym: And then the next day or two, you return back to the base camp.

604
00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:54,880
Scott: See, the thing is, I'm not really too much into the walking around in the woods.

605
00:30:55,121 --> 00:31:02,820
Rym: I like the making a campfire and fire is other than campfire chili and campfire curry.

606
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:03,704
Scott: Yeah.

607
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:05,660
Rym: Campfire is the best part of camping.

608
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,453
Scott: I like campfire, you know, doing campfire activities, eating campfire food, cooking campfire food.

609
00:31:11,473 --> 00:31:11,574
Scott: Right.

610
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,579
Scott: That's the number one best part.

611
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:19,686
Scott: The simple stuff like hobo meal, hot dog on a stick you took from the woods, just grab a hot cold hot dog.

612
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,520
Rym: We took from the woods like you found the hot dog.

613
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:27,481
Scott: You grab a stick from the woods, you take a defrosted frozen hot dog, you shove it on the end.

614
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:33,720
Scott: after you sanitize the stick in the fire, you stick the hot dog in the fire and then you eat it off the stick and then you put a marshmallow on the stick.

615
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:35,364
Rym: So you've clearly.

616
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:44,279
Rym: have you ever gone camping where you had to bring primarily non perishable goods that don't require any free refrigeration of any kind?

617
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,180
Rym: I mean, it was all like you can't like for the kind of camping I used to do.

618
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:52,840
Scott: The longest camp was in the desert for like, you know, I guess three, four days.

619
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:54,760
Scott: The camel carried all the food.

620
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,040
Rym: Yeah.

621
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:00,049
Rym: But I'm saying you can't bring things that require cooling or refrigeration most of the time.

622
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:00,560
Scott: Oh, yeah.

623
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,629
Scott: Well, the hot dog situation was mostly like.

624
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:05,160
Scott: that was mostly in summer camp.

625
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:05,461
Scott: Right.

626
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:10,759
Scott: Basically once a week we would just they had basically these campfires like in the woods on the edge of the camp.

627
00:32:11,122 --> 00:32:13,720
Scott: So once a week you would just do campfire without camping.

628
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,980
Scott: So it's like you'd go do a campfire and then go to bed in the cabin.

629
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:21,115
Rym: Kevin, I think, but it's just the campfire you were able to.

630
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:23,227
Scott: you were able to get campfires without camping.

631
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:24,980
Scott: You only camp like once every four weeks.

632
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,242
Rym: Look at how much we like, like in one of the parties or like at our friend's wedding before.

633
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:36,977
Rym: There's something about you start a big fire and you and all your good first invention before they had TV, before they had books, fire.

634
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,813
Rym: If it's like acquaintances or strangers.

635
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,221
Rym: But if it's like your close friends and a relatively small group, you got a fire in the middle.

636
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:52,940
Rym: You sit around the fire, mostly not talking, staring at the fire, drinking things, maybe cooking marshmallows.

637
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,860
Rym: Your feet get too hot and your shoes melt a little bit.

638
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:59,780
Scott: Don't sit down when there's always that came in.

639
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,807
Rym: There's always that one group of people who sits there and they talk about, oh, we should do something to the fire.

640
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:06,300
Rym: Hey, I think I'm gonna put another log on the fire.

641
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,519
Rym: Man, you made a really good fire.

642
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:08,758
Scott: Yeah, fire managers.

643
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,299
Rym: But then there's the other people who ignore that and sit there saying nothing.

644
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:13,025
Scott: Yeah.

645
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:14,959
Rym: And then there's the people who play Benjungka.

646
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:19,128
Rym: There's something about that.

647
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:27,040
Scott: That's what I'm saying is like we think about all the different mediums of entertainment, you know, TV, movies, books, music, fire, video games, board games, fire.

648
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,240
Scott: It was the first one like sitting and it's the one that's least enjoyed by people.

649
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:31,683
Scott: The reason.

650
00:33:31,724 --> 00:33:33,200
Rym: But here's why I like having so much.

651
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:40,780
Rym: We combine all these things that as adults we don't get and as adults who are no longer in college, we don't get them often anymore.

652
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:47,219
Rym: These are things you really only get in college or you get snippets of them camping as a kid at summer camps, places like that.

653
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,720
Rym: You get one sit around the fire, which we just talked about why that's great.

654
00:33:52,360 --> 00:34:05,362
Rym: Two, you get the sleepover situation of you and a bunch of friends are in a tent or sleeping isolated and nobody will shut the fuck up, which is a very important aspect of enjoyment.

655
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:11,840
Rym: Three, you don't have access to your technology and you're basically just hanging out with each other.

656
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:17,000
Rym: And four, there is no way you can do any work or be productive in any way.

657
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:20,639
Rym: So as a result, you're going to do nothing but fuck around.

658
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:23,840
Rym: Those are the four key elements that make camping great.

659
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,840
Scott: And there's another element that you're forgetting.

660
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:33,183
Scott: See, I don't really like walking long distance in the woods, but explore the woods, right?

661
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:42,944
Scott: Because a lot of times a woods will have all sorts of, you know, hidey holes and type of things, the kind of things that inspired like, you know, Zelda one and Miyazaki movies.

662
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:43,487
Scott: Right.

663
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,040
Scott: So it's like near your camp.

664
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:50,741
Scott: There's going to be like, oh, that weird tree that looks like maybe someone was lynched on it.

665
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,100
Scott: Oh, and there's that weird kind of cave.

666
00:34:53,601 --> 00:35:02,280
Scott: Oh, and there's that little rock thing that hides some salamanders under it and all that kind of action that's right near, you know, and you can explore all those bits.

667
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,346
Scott: Down by the stream.

668
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:05,640
Scott: Oh, look, there's a little there's a little nook in the stream.

669
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,756
Scott: There's something going on over here.

670
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:08,489
Scott: Check out all that stuff.

671
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:09,820
Scott: That's really good.

672
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,259
Scott: That's the other aspect you did not mention.

673
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:12,849
Scott: The good aspects.

674
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:13,980
Scott: I like that aspect a lot.

675
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,379
Rym: Now, there are problems with camping.

676
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:20,580
Rym: One, most people I've known who have camped in quotes have never actually camped.

677
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Rym: And they usually bring these gigantic tents and these gigantic pavilions.

678
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,910
Scott: The more money you spend on your camp equipment, the less you are actually camping and the more you are.

679
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:31,698
Scott: It's like a hotel.

680
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:34,540
Rym: You'll spend more on better equipment.

681
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Scott: The problem is just bringing bulky and or useless equipment or equipment that makes it more like the people like people like drive their SUV, back it up into the camp and use the power of the SUV to turn a TV on and shit.

682
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:47,344
Scott: Right.

683
00:35:47,384 --> 00:35:47,931
Scott: It's like, come on.

684
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:48,740
Rym: That's not camping.

685
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:50,217
Rym: That's just portable motel.

686
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:50,460
Scott: Right.

687
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:50,843
Scott: Exactly.

688
00:35:50,863 --> 00:35:53,080
Scott: It's like I think a lot of those super giant tents.

689
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:54,860
Scott: That's basically a portable hotel.

690
00:35:55,161 --> 00:35:55,341
Scott: Right.

691
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:59,520
Scott: It's like you have to be abandoning a certain amount of stuff.

692
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,300
Scott: And only do the camp stuff for it to be camping.

693
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:02,961
Scott: Yeah.

694
00:36:02,981 --> 00:36:03,947
Scott: You know, and it's obviously.

695
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:08,759
Scott: it's like, OK, obviously you don't have to just go naked into the woods and hunt and gather all your food.

696
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:09,622
Scott: Right.

697
00:36:09,963 --> 00:36:13,097
Scott: And make fire with only sticks and not bring any matches as a line.

698
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:14,162
Scott: Right.

699
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,300
Scott: And it's, you know, it's a little gray area of how much stuff can you bring?

700
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,960
Scott: It's like, can you bring, you know, a little gas lighter?

701
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:21,499
Scott: It's like, yeah, you can bring that.

702
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:22,042
Scott: Right.

703
00:36:22,384 --> 00:36:25,480
Scott: Can you bring some log that automatically sets on fire?

704
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,587
Scott: That's sort of cheating.

705
00:36:26,628 --> 00:36:28,180
Scott: You should probably collect some firewood.

706
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:41,260
Rym: I guess there's a difference between people who know basic survival skills and bring the right things versus people who bring things that seem comfortable, but don't really understand the ramifications of those things.

707
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:41,641
Scott: Yeah.

708
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:44,600
Scott: It's like, can you bring a tent to protect yourself from the elements?

709
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,919
Scott: It's like, yeah, you probably need one of those motherfuckers.

710
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:50,140
Scott: It's like, can I bring basically a pavilion?

711
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:54,420
Scott: It's like you could, but that's basically you're not in the woods.

712
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:55,560
Rym: Well, it depends.

713
00:36:55,761 --> 00:37:04,040
Rym: For example, you bring the pavilion to your base camp and then you set out with a lesser amount of material from the base camp.

714
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,060
Scott: I had to see the pavilion to judge it.

715
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,780
Scott: It might be too fancy a pavilion.

716
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,680
Scott: I guess if it has some sort of climate control, that's not just flaps.

717
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:12,824
Scott: That is too much.

718
00:37:13,326 --> 00:37:16,660
Rym: But there are, you know, the things that it has lights too much.

719
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,100
Rym: The things I do dislike about camping that mosquitoes depends on where you are.

720
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,239
Rym: You got to choose a good spot to avoid that shit.

721
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,658
Rym: But also things like not really being able to bathe.

722
00:37:29,443 --> 00:37:30,900
Scott: Well, you don't go for that long.

723
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,445
Rym: Yeah, you do.

724
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,879
Rym: I've been camping for weeks.

725
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,800
Scott: You also haven't been camping for weeks.

726
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:39,379
Scott: And then you always find, you know, like a stream or something to roll around in.

727
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,880
Scott: That's often not a camp near some water.

728
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,242
Scott: I don't.

729
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:42,624
Scott: All right.

730
00:37:42,664 --> 00:37:45,220
Rym: In particular, you've ever been winter camping.

731
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:47,679
Rym: You basically cannot bathe.

732
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,204
Scott: That's true.

733
00:37:48,245 --> 00:37:49,339
Scott: Well, desert, we couldn't bathe.

734
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,459
Scott: We were only in the desert for, I think, four days, something like that.

735
00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:57,260
Scott: So we bathe before we left and bathe and got back covered in sand otherwise.

736
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,489
Scott: But it's dry sand.

737
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,280
Scott: So no one is really sticky.

738
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,449
Rym: It's a dry heat.

739
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:01,580
Scott: Yeah, it's a desert.

740
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:03,324
Scott: Come on.

741
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:05,879
Rym: But that's pretty much it.

742
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,920
Rym: That and people sometimes if you run out of food, you can't for too long.

743
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,290
Rym: The food basically gets increasingly worse.

744
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,880
Rym: the longer you have camps because you're eating the more preserved food.

745
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,403
Rym: You've got less fresh eggs and bacon and more jerky and trail unless you actually hunt and gather.

746
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:25,280
Rym: Yeah, which I have never I've gathered, but I've never hunted.

747
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:27,208
Scott: Yeah, I didn't.

748
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:28,180
Scott: I haven't gathered much.

749
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,948
Rym: I've done so far as gathering things like.

750
00:38:32,152 --> 00:38:34,700
Rym: I have gathered nuts in some places.

751
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,999
Scott: I've never seen a nut tree.

752
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,680
Rym: And I have gathered like cattails because you can take the roots and they're super good.

753
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,426
Rym: They're like scallions.

754
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:42,100
Rym: And I've gathered dandelion.

755
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,591
Scott: And I don't like to eat dandelion.

756
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,179
Rym: Dandelion is delicious.

757
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:44,785
Scott: It's a weed.

758
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:45,600
Scott: It's delicious shit.

759
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,367
Scott: It's a weed.

760
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:47,199
Scott: It's not a food.

761
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:48,063
Rym: Yeah.

762
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,339
Rym: A lot of things that you consider food are also considered weeds.

763
00:38:50,783 --> 00:38:51,045
Scott: No.

764
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:52,740
Rym: And dandelions are food.

765
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,320
Scott: No.

766
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:54,326
Rym: In fact, that L.I.C.

767
00:38:54,346 --> 00:38:57,000
Rym: place you get brunch at has a really good dandelion frittata.

768
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,019
Scott: Is it run by hippies?

769
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:58,902
Rym: Actually, no.

770
00:39:00,146 --> 00:39:04,720
Rym: It's got a lot of fancy restaurants sell and serve dandelions.

771
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,100
Rym: Fresh Direct sells dandelions.

772
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,440
Scott: A lot of fancy restaurants these days are hippie restaurants.

773
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:10,919
Rym: Non hippie restaurants, Scott.

774
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:15,300
Scott: How come they're not coming to harvest my lawn?

775
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:18,260
Rym: Because your lawn has pesticides and bullshit on it.

776
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,658
Rym: And that's not efficient in any way.

777
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:22,723
Rym: Hey.

778
00:39:22,823 --> 00:39:26,059
Rym: Anyway, but there's always amateur hour, too.

779
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:29,099
Rym: I've many times I've been camping with people who don't quite know what's up.

780
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:35,359
Rym: Number one, the person who does not understand how tents work.

781
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:36,900
Scott: No, I can't set up the tent.

782
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,920
Scott: These are the that's that's so common.

783
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,360
Scott: It's made fun of in like every TV show or movie about camping.

784
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,469
Scott: Dude can't set up the tent.

785
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:44,479
Scott: It's like the first joke.

786
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:56,780
Rym: But it's the specific thing that I always see happen are the people who, because they haven't really been outdoorsy people, they seem to make this differentiation in their mind between indoors and outdoors.

787
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,940
Rym: Like you don't think about the fact that we're sitting indoors doing GeekNights and 10 feet to my left is outdoors.

788
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:05,879
Rym: Yeah, it's right there all the time.

789
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,299
Rym: There's not any real difference.

790
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,780
Scott: No, but that's true.

791
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:16,420
Scott: But doors have a psychological effect on people like, you know, I notice I've read about this a lot in terms like video game level design.

792
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,440
Scott: It's like they'll put a door when they want you to sort of psychologically change your frame of reference.

793
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:34,804
Scott: Like if you put a door like in between two rooms and the two rooms, the puzzle spans the two rooms, you're going to fuck everyone up because when they go into room two, room one gets washed away from their brains by the door.

794
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:35,770
Scott: So you guys.

795
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:41,220
Scott: that's why in Zelda, it's always you're not going to see a door splitting up a puzzle into separate pieces too often.

796
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:41,522
Scott: Right.

797
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,919
Scott: It's always, you know, each room has a puzzle to it.

798
00:40:44,384 --> 00:40:45,639
Scott: And it's the same thing with the real world.

799
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,430
Scott: And you go in a door.

800
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:46,593
Scott: Right.

801
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,680
Scott: I come into your apartment, I forget the hallway, but the hallways right there.

802
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,680
Scott: It's so close, but it's not in my mind.

803
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:54,919
Scott: It's compartmentalized by the physical doors.

804
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:57,420
Scott: And so is the, you know, the wilderness.

805
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:00,440
Scott: When you leave your car, suddenly you're outside.

806
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,580
Scott: It's totally different from being in the car, even though physically you're like an inch away, just glass in between.

807
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:06,603
Scott: Right.

808
00:41:06,804 --> 00:41:09,139
Scott: It's like if you park your car on the side of the highway and get out to pee.

809
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,580
Scott: It's like, whoa, totally different world suddenly.

810
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:12,042
Scott: Yep.

811
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:17,900
Rym: I used to do that very often when I drive back from Rochester to Michigan, just for like weekends to see my family or whatever.

812
00:41:18,882 --> 00:41:20,020
Rym: I'd always do it in the middle of the night.

813
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,620
Rym: Like I'd leave at like midnight and drive through the night.

814
00:41:23,821 --> 00:41:25,060
Rym: And these were these very pleasant.

815
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,140
Rym: Like I have these many fond memories of just blasting music and driving through the night on an empty highway with blackness in all directions.

816
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:39,480
Rym: And occasionally I just stop on the side of the freeway, turn off my engine, get out of the car and just walk like off into a field for a few minutes.

817
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,920
Rym: It was just a very interesting and kind of eerie experience when we talk about.

818
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:52,140
Rym: But what I'm getting at is that these people think of the inside of their tent as indoors and they do not understand how capillary action works.

819
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:55,700
Rym: And they don't understand that tents are often not actually waterproof.

820
00:41:56,962 --> 00:42:00,360
Rym: And their bedroll is right up next to the fucking edge of their tent.

821
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,859
Rym: And or they didn't put a tarp over the top of their tent.

822
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:04,638
Rym: It rains or a dews.

823
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,619
Rym: The entire inside of their tent is soaking wet the next day.

824
00:42:08,022 --> 00:42:08,909
Scott: Yeah, it's bad.

825
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,179
Scott: I'm guessing this has happened to you.

826
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,840
Rym: Never happened to me because I know it happened to someone you were with.

827
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,765
Rym: I was a Cub Scout.

828
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:16,220
Rym: I learned I had actual lessons on this bullshit.

829
00:42:17,022 --> 00:42:18,659
Rym: I've seen it happen to so many people.

830
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:23,939
Rym: Amateur hour number two are the people who don't stake their tent down and it just blows away.

831
00:42:24,483 --> 00:42:26,119
Scott: Or that's the most common joke you see.

832
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:35,200
Rym: Or they put their tents in what appears like a good spot that is actually a place where rainwater will collect and or wash.

833
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:36,004
Scott: Mm hmm.

834
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:38,899
Scott: All right.

835
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,381
Scott: Yeah.

836
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:41,920
Scott: Why don't we talk about going to the bathroom when camping?

837
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,890
Rym: Fucking pee in the woods.

838
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:43,620
Rym: It's awesome.

839
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,262
Scott: Yeah.

840
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:46,179
Scott: But what if you got to poop?

841
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:59,060
Rym: So sometimes I've been to places where we're camping, like our base camp is near a place where the park service or someone has dug latrines or set up designated places that it'll be taken care of porta potties.

842
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:11,380
Rym: I have only once or twice in my life gone camping in such a place where I either had to poop in a bag and take it out with me, which in some preserves you have to do that or you have to dig a cat hole.

843
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:19,859
Rym: And let me tell you, if you are going somewhere where you're going to have to dig cat holes, for the love of God, learn how to do that.

844
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:23,119
Rym: So don't fuck it up or bears will come and murder you.

845
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,947
Scott: That's also true.

846
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:25,340
Scott: That's why you need the anti bear weapon.

847
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,469
Rym: They need the bear ball.

848
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,640
Rym: You need the bear blasters.

849
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,816
Scott: Yeah, we had those.

850
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,754
Scott: But yeah, in the desert, though, right?

851
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:34,020
Scott: It's totally different in the woods.

852
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,060
Scott: In the woods, your biggest worry is like, did I bring toilet paper?

853
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,478
Scott: Should I use a leaf or something?

854
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:38,640
Scott: Right.

855
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,580
Scott: And you sort of throw it away into the woods or put it in a trash bag or something.

856
00:43:43,064 --> 00:43:43,733
Scott: And the desert.

857
00:43:44,098 --> 00:43:44,280
Scott: Right.

858
00:43:44,381 --> 00:43:46,720
Scott: It's like, OK, if you just pee, just pee in the desert.

859
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,937
Scott: Whatever desert's happy to have some fucking water.

860
00:43:49,098 --> 00:43:49,300
Scott: Right.

861
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,572
Scott: What do you poop in the desert?

862
00:43:50,592 --> 00:43:51,260
Scott: Right.

863
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:53,280
Scott: OK, just leave some poop in the middle of desert.

864
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,039
Scott: Who gives a shit besides the shit.

865
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:57,580
Scott: But how do you wipe yourself in the desert?

866
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,488
Scott: There ain't no leaf.

867
00:43:59,094 --> 00:43:59,740
Scott: There ain't no nothing.

868
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,465
Scott: Just sand.

869
00:44:00,506 --> 00:44:01,639
Scott: You can wipe your ass with sand.

870
00:44:02,521 --> 00:44:04,060
Rym: No, I would waste some of my water.

871
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:06,240
Scott: No, it's not going to do it right.

872
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,340
Scott: You have to physically wipe.

873
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,939
Scott: See, what you do is you bring toilet paper with you into the desert and you bring it out with you.

874
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:11,423
Scott: No.

875
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,219
Scott: And then how do you get rid of the toilet paper?

876
00:44:13,762 --> 00:44:14,005
Scott: All right.

877
00:44:14,227 --> 00:44:15,460
Scott: You set it on fucking fire.

878
00:44:15,562 --> 00:44:16,171
Scott: That's what you do.

879
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:16,679
Scott: Right.

880
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,279
Scott: But you don't set it on fire in the campfire.

881
00:44:18,641 --> 00:44:19,627
Scott: You just leave.

882
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:21,740
Scott: you basically have the designated area.

883
00:44:21,861 --> 00:44:25,560
Scott: It's like walk at least this many paces away from the fire, the campfire.

884
00:44:26,201 --> 00:44:29,700
Scott: You know, if you even have one in the desert, you might not need one except for cooking.

885
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,518
Scott: You don't need it for warmth.

886
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:35,540
Scott: And then poop, wipe yourself and then set the toilet paper on fire at the spot you pooped and then come back.

887
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,280
Scott: And a lot of people like had trouble setting their toilet paper on fire.

888
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,223
Scott: Pretty sad.

889
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:42,089
Scott: Like, come on, guys.

890
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,400
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

891
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:53,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

892
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,960
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

893
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,880
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

894
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:06,620
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

895
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

896
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,440
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

897
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,600
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
