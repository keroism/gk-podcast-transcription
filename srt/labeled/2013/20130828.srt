00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,988
Rym: It's Wednesday, August 28th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:13,151
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:13,773
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:16,660
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, Attack on Titan.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,448
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:33,290
Rym: The other day, uh, Emily was kind enough to buy some tickets and we went with some friends to go see Potted Potter, which was supposedly- They've been advertising the fuck out of that everywhere.

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,650
Rym: Yep, but I read some reviews and people seemed to have good things to say about it.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,060
Rym: And I'm not a big fan of the Harry Potter books But I'm a big fan of reduced Shakespeare and those kinds of things.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,378
Rym: So I figured, all right, this appears to be a 70-minute summary of all of Harry Potter.

10
00:00:48,438 --> 00:00:51,590
Rym: That could be pretty good and it's selling out and people seem to really like it.

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,052
Scott: It's possibly good.

12
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:53,519
Scott: Well, it's advertised everywhere.

13
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:55,790
Scott: It could be contributing any of the fact that it's Harry Potter.

14
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,203
Scott: Yeah, but- I'm surprised it's not like, is it actually like legal?

15
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:02,210
Scott: Like, did Harry Potter endorse this shit?

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,450
Rym: Well, parodies are pretty heavily covered by the First Amendment.

17
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,696
Scott: Yeah, but they're calling it Potter, right?

18
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:08,197
Scott: Exactly.

19
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:09,180
Scott: And charging money.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,641
Scott: I don't know.

21
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:18,990
Rym: Yeah, but regardless, uh, so we went to see it and I'm not gonna say it's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life because I did in fact see a man die once.

22
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:20,562
Scott: Great digital target?

23
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:26,273
Rym: This was What a- this is an- It was bad.

24
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:26,956
Rym: I'll tell you what.

25
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:28,421
Rym: It is bad.

26
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:29,305
Rym: It is so bad.

27
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:30,610
Rym: It is so bad.

28
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:33,668
Rym: It is hard to express how bad it is.

29
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:50,890
Rym: What I will say is that in the 74 minutes of this event, maybe 5% of that was actually Harry Potter jokes and the rest was the performers mugging for the audience and making meta jokes about how they don't know anything about Harry Potter.

30
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,092
Scott: Really?

31
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:52,755
Scott: Really.

32
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:56,090
Scott: You think the whole thing would be Harry Potter jokes, even if they were bad ones?

33
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:03,050
Rym: It was- it was the most superficial you could be and still even be close to being Harry Potter.

34
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:09,229
Rym: It was literally like every joke was a one-note joke and then the same meta joke, "If you haven't read the books, have

35
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:09,350
Rym: you?".

36
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:09,940
Scott: "Ha ha

37
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:10,002
Scott: ha.".

38
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,651
Scott: Mmm.

39
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:12,297
Rym: The acting was bad.

40
00:02:12,317 --> 00:02:14,243
Rym: The interaction was bad.

41
00:02:14,263 --> 00:02:16,190
Rym: The stage setup was bad.

42
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,850
Scott: How did they get enough money to advertise all the fuck over town?

43
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:21,038
Rym: So it keeps selling out, right?

44
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:23,050
Rym: And the audience, it- you know what it played like?

45
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,899
Rym: Imagine bad children's theater.

46
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:29,549
Rym: Like, you know, imagine cosplay chess.

47
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:30,671
Rym: Yep.

48
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,563
Rym: Or, I don't know, any cosplay event at a convention other than- That shit's popular.

49
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:36,650
Rym: Other than the judging of costumes.

50
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,666
Scott: So any cosplay skit, any cosplay related event- How were the costumes and sets and things?

51
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:42,589
Rym: Uh, non-existent.

52
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:42,910
Rym: Awful.

53
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:43,816
Scott: Oh, okay.

54
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:44,180
Rym: The worst.

55
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:48,061
Rym: It was a terrible, terrible thing.

56
00:02:48,182 --> 00:03:00,143
Rym: It's going to Boston now, so I encourage all of you out there, if you even think or know anyone who might think that they might want to go see Potted Potter, just slap the tickets out of their hands and tear their credit card up.

57
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:05,310
Rym: If they like cosplay chess- Yeah, if you like cosplay chess, you will love the fuck out of this Potted Potter.

58
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:08,678
Scott: But- Or the cosplot at the Masquerade?

59
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:12,030
Rym: It was not as good as the cosplot at the Masquerade.

60
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,300
Scott: Whoa, that is seriously bad.

61
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,445
Rym: I'm actually gonna say that.

62
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:16,690
Scott: Cosplot is unintelligible.

63
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,881
Rym: Yes, but the cosplot at least had a pretty well-acted Skeletor.

64
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,030
Scott: That guy Skeletor was pro MVP Skeletor.

65
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,577
Rym: That Skeletor was better than anything that happens.

66
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:34,361
Rym: They should have just made a short Skeletor show and that- I would watch a periodic five-minute webinar, webisode show.

67
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:35,926
Rym: that was just that Skeletor.

68
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:36,648
Scott: That might exist.

69
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:37,210
Rym: It might.

70
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,345
Rym: Potted Potter is an abortion.

71
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:41,030
Scott: Okay.

72
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:43,132
Scott: Or it should be.

73
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:47,605
Scott: The sad part is the audience- It's a baby that's not doing too well and needs an abortion.

74
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:55,170
Rym: The audience was about three quarters adults about my age without children, who seemed equally unimpressed.

75
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:56,057
Scott: Oh, really?

76
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,026
Scott: There wasn't a large applause?

77
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:04,170
Rym: There was a large applause, but the people in the- like, basically the other quarter of the audience was families with little kids.

78
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:11,190
Rym: And all the adults, almost without exception, were people who obviously do not commonly go to the theater.

79
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:17,709
Rym: They were taking the playbills and going like, "Oh my god, a playbill, ooh," and just listening to their conversations.

80
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,870
Rym: Yeah, Potted Potter is great if you've never seen a mediocre cosplay chess before.

81
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,830
Rym: So yeah, that's what I think your cosplay chess.

82
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:30,092
Scott: Sure.

83
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:33,142
Scott: Okay, so I don't really have a news right now.

84
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:41,868
Scott: So what I'm gonna do is I did, however, find some time recently to read some of the comics that have been piling the fuck up in my apartment.

85
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:44,630
Rym: Oh my god, I'm barely working my way through the adventure time.

86
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:56,450
Scott: I get a whole box of comics fucking every month at my doorstep, and I can barely read any of them because I'm too busy with other geekeries, but I read through all basically the single-issue floppy comics and a couple trades.

87
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:05,024
Scott: So among those single-issue floppy comics, of course, most written, or right, or not as bad as Potted Potter, but you know, not good.

88
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:11,730
Scott: And there were, of course, some gems, and I want to talk to you today about The Gemist, right?

89
00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:17,430
Scott: Written by none other than the most heralded comic creator, perhaps, of GeekNights.

90
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,150
Rym: You know, it would be fitting if this were Gem, the comic, but I know it's not.

91
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,586
Scott: Yeah, no, Jeff Lemire, who's the person where we, you know, the must-read of all GeekNights.

92
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:40,390
Rym: Jeff Lemire's one of those people, you know, he's one of those people that we love everything they do without question, and it would take a lot of bad works coming out of them for us to stop loving them.

93
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:48,390
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, so Jeff Lemire's latest comic, A Sweet Tooth Ended, so his new vertical comic is Trillium, right?

94
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:59,891
Scott: So I pick up Trillium, and I just start reading it, and I get to the title page, which is page two, and I notice that there's two sets of credits, and they're sort of upside down each other, and I'm like, "What the

95
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:00,192
Scott: fuck?".

96
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:17,948
Scott: And I sort of flip to the back, and I realize there's like an upside-down, it's a flip book, which is, they do a lot of that on free comic book day, where you put one cover on one side and one cover on the other side, and you flip the book over, and basically there's one comic that reads and ends in the middle, and another comic that reads and ends in the middle, that we get two comics and one book, right?

97
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:34,309
Scott: And I'm kind of glad I didn't buy this in trade so that I could get the flip experience, because when I got to the middle, this is not really a spoiler, it's actually the same goddamn comic book, it wasn't two in one, and it's called Trillium, so I wonder what the fuck the third thing is.

98
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:43,857
Scott: This might be the best, I mean, just based on this one issue, right, this may be the best comic Jeff Lemire's done ever.

99
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:50,095
Rym: I was gonna say, Jeff Lemire, so how would you rate it on the scale of Silver Surfer to Saga?

100
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:52,222
Scott: It's not as good as Saga.

101
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:54,790
Rym: I thought you were gonna say it's not as good as Silver Surfer.

102
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,815
Scott: And I like Silver Surfer a lot, but it's better than that, so, you know.

103
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:01,016
Scott: Alright.

104
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:07,704
Scott: But yeah, if you're reading comics, and you're already reading Saga, you gotta read fucking Trillium.

105
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:12,701
Scott: I mean, seriously, come on, this is probably, it's probably the second best comic made right now.

106
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:14,267
Scott: that's coming out in stores today.

107
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:14,848
Rym: Alright.

108
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:16,591
Scott: So, there you go.

109
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:22,250
Scott: And it's, yeah, the one half was sci-fi, and the other half was like Indiana Jones type shit.

110
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,480
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

111
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:38,190
Rym: I'm gonna cop out, we're finally doing the Attack on Titan, I'm gonna get a bunch of the best Attack on Titan mashups out of my system and never talk about it again.

112
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,098
Scott: Alright, Muffy, or Miffy, is that still the best one?

113
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,273
Rym: I don't know, I mean, I made one with Emmanuel Yarbrough, so I'm linking to that one.

114
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:46,916
Rym: Great.

115
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:52,395
Rym: And I guess the ones I like the most are the Adventure Time one, not the one you're thinking of.

116
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,404
Scott: I like the one that uses children's programming.

117
00:07:54,545 --> 00:07:57,099
Rym: Yeah, I like the Adventure Time one, I like the Pingu one a lot.

118
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,509
Scott: Pingu one is like number two.

119
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:14,547
Rym: Yeah, and the one that I'm making privately, this, I'm gonna find out if our friend Scott Johnson listens to the show, because I have this video of him playing DDR with other Scott in our apartment, and none of us had shirts on, and I'm gonna mash that up with the Attack on Titan opening.

120
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:14,949
Scott: Okay.

121
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:29,374
Scott: So, my thing of the day, in Japan, at the offices of, I believe, Shogakukan, which is probably the biggest manga company publisher after Shueisha, which is the jump company, Shogakukan is number two.

122
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:37,038
Scott: They got friggin, you know, 20th Century Boys and all these other, you know, Urasawa works there, all kinds of great comics come out of there.

123
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,205
Scott: And they have an office.

124
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:40,909
Scott: that is mega old office.

125
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:49,310
Scott: The office is like, I think it's in Osaka, like near where, you know, Tezuka and all those people, like, you know, originally did comics way back in the day.

126
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:53,570
Scott: So, this is like the historic manga office, but it was just too small.

127
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:58,330
Scott: So, they had to get a newer, better, more modern office, and the old office is getting knocked the fuck down.

128
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:12,610
Scott: So, what they did, after they cleared it out, they got all the manga people to come to the office, and they all came, and they drew mangas all over the walls, and then they sold tickets to let people come and look at it, and then they knocked it down, and then they moved to their new office.

129
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:24,397
Scott: So, here is all the pictures and video and whatnot of all the awesome stuff, all the best mangas in Japan drew on the walls, in their office, before losing it.

130
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:25,440
Scott: Oh my God.

131
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,630
Scott: If you care anything about manga, this is super awesome and important.

132
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:30,550
Rym: So, the Book Club book is Stazzyland.

133
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,290
Rym: We are on our way to PAX, or at PAX, by the time you listen to this.

134
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,850
Rym: We're presenting bad games in the Wolfman Theater at noon on Monday.

135
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:41,889
Rym: Might not be a show or two.

136
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:49,410
Rym: We'll see if we could do shows after PAX, because we might be tired from four days of PAX, and the PAX charity event that's not PAX sanctioned.

137
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,590
Scott: Yeah, the pre, and also there's a pre-Pax day and a post-Pax day.

138
00:09:52,930 --> 00:10:01,529
Rym: The pre-Pax sky-high tabletop play benefiting Food Lifeline, where we will be VIPs running games with people, playing games with people, eating food with people.

139
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,394
Rym: Good times.

140
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:06,790
Rym: We got a fuck-ton of videos from conventions up on the internet.

141
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,170
Rym: Scott just put out a new episode of the newsletter.

142
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:12,210
Rym: I was waiting for you to say something about the episode.

143
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:22,870
Rym: Our newsletter is pretty boss, and people seem to really like it, so if you're not subscribed to it, better get subscribed, and maybe you can trade people to get them to forward you previous newsletters.

144
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:23,848
Scott: Something like that.

145
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,989
Rym: 'Cause if we get a lot of requests from people who subscribe, and they're like, "Hey, how can I get the old

146
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:28,210
Rym: ones?".

147
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,264
Rym: It's like, "Yeah, you should subscribe

148
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:29,548
Rym: sooner.".

149
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:29,775
Rym: Yeah.

150
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:33,490
Rym: We're not gonna make an RSS feed of this shit, otherwise you won't subscribe.

151
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,329
Scott: That's a shame.

152
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,930
Scott: Gotta remind people once in a while, we exist in their email box, where they actually look.

153
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,390
Scott: A place they actually look if they don't check our forums or don't use Twitter and don't use Facebook.

154
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,870
Scott: People check their email at least once a day, hopefully, if they're not that disconnected.

155
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:53,250
Scott: So we can get into their new email box once every once in a while to remind them that we exist.

156
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,110
Scott: That should help, right?

157
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,750
Rym: Also, gonna give you guys a heads up on MAGFest.

158
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:04,348
Rym: It's a ways out, you know, New Year's, but the hotel at the con, I hear, is already like 80% sold out.

159
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,870
Scott: Which is much better than other conventions that fill up instantly.

160
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,108
Rym: Yup, like PAX.

161
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,030
Scott: But that doesn't mean you shouldn't go and get a hotel room right the fuck now.

162
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,410
Scott: Why don't you have one already?

163
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,507
Rym: You should be at MAGFest.

164
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:22,387
Scott: Why aren't you already at MAGFest being like, if you're sitting there going like, "Yeah, I already got my room and ticket for MAGFest, and the transportation,

165
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:22,648
Scott: uhh."

166
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:24,370
Scott: Then, you're the smart person.

167
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,870
Scott: If that's not you, what the fuck is wrong with you?

168
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,889
Rym: Yeah, MAGFest, look, we like PAX a lot, if you couldn't tell.

169
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:34,849
Rym: We like MAGFest almost as much.

170
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,189
Rym: For very different reasons.

171
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,128
Scott: Uhh, not yet.

172
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,284
Rym: It's too soon, too soon.

173
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:48,510
Rym: MAGFest is the one con, if you want to just hang out with us and play games at four in the morning, we're actually just hanging out playing games at four in the morning.

174
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,710
Scott: That's all you do at MAGFest, it's always four in the morning.

175
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,330
Scott: You're always hanging out, you're always playing games, except for the Machine Supremacy concert.

176
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,709
Scott: Yes, Machine Supremacy's first appearance.

177
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,410
Scott: First time in US ever.

178
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:02,470
Scott: I've waited over a decade, and now I am rewarded.

179
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:08,978
Rym: This is one of those things where every year I tell everyone I know who works for the Penny Arcade Expo, I'm like, "Yeah, get Machine Supremacy.

180
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,109
Scott: Come on, just get him, please, get him, just get him, get

181
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:11,210
Scott: him.".

182
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:11,689
Rym: But MAGFest did it.

183
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:12,970
Rym: MAGFest got him.

184
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,510
Scott: That's how badass MAGFest is, they got what PAX could not or would not get.

185
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:18,569
Rym: [laughs].

186
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:31,349
Rym: So, I feel like this is the hot show that we should talk about, and for all of you who complain that we don't talk about anime that's on right now, one, we're actually watching a shit ton of anime, didn't we just review Shinseki Yori not that long ago?

187
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,377
Scott: - I didn't watch that.

188
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:33,609
Rym: - Two, I did, and we reviewed it.

189
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,830
Rym: Well, I reviewed it with Emily.

190
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,770
Rym: But Attack on Titan, Shingeki no Kyojin.

191
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:46,189
Scott: Just as with Ponies, and with Madoka, people talked about it so goddamn much, they talked about it way more than everything else.

192
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:47,989
Rym: Emily and I started watching it before you did.

193
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:55,009
Scott: Yeah, but people talked about it so the fuck much, that it's like, "Well, I guess I have to at least take a look at that, 'cause no one will shut up about

194
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:55,090
Scott: it.".

195
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,150
Scott: They're not shuttin' up about it ten times more than usual.

196
00:12:58,271 --> 00:12:59,269
Rym: Shut up, shuttin' up.

197
00:12:59,450 --> 00:12:59,912
Scott: That's right.

198
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:10,090
Scott: So, after I got, you know, I had some free time, enough free time to read comics, so I had free time enough to watch anime, so I went out and I watched the Attack on Titans.

199
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,090
Scott: Actually, I got five volumes of the manga, and then watched the anime.

200
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,790
Scott: Yup, now Scott started reading the manga.

201
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,689
Scott: I've seen 20 anime episodes, which I think is all of them.

202
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:20,550
Scott: Yeah, 'cause once in my life.

203
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:26,870
Scott: And I've read five volume mangas, which is all of them that are in English, that you can buy, but you can read more if you scan.

204
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,889
Rym: Now, Scott started reading the manga, and I was like, "Just watch the show, the show is way

205
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:32,110
Rym: better.".

206
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,706
Rym: 'Cause I'd flipped through the manga and it was kinda meh.

207
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:35,470
Rym: The show, it's kinda like Death Note.

208
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:43,030
Rym: Death Note, as a comic, is great, but the anime is just the comic plus music, so you might as well just read the comic.

209
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:44,070
Scott: Uh, okay.

210
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:49,248
Rym: But, No Dame Cantabile is a comic about music.

211
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:56,929
Rym: Reading the comic is not as good as watching the anime, 'cause in the anime you actually get to hear it.

212
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,569
Scott: Yeah, same thing with, like, Beck, or Digital D.

213
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:04,130
Rym: There are often anime and manga pairs where they are the exact same plot.

214
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,050
Rym: Sometimes you wanna watch or read one of them over the other one, because there's a reason to.

215
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,229
Scott: Sometimes you wanna mix it up.

216
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,870
Scott: I watched Hajime no Ippo, and then when there was no more anime left, even though more is coming out this season, I switched over to the manga.

217
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,830
Rym: Yep, Monster, just because of who made it, and because of what it is, I prefer the comic, and I read the comic.

218
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:31,850
Rym: The show seems okay, but the comic, I burned through it so fast, because I really needed to know what it was about.

219
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:38,269
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, it's a weird thing, 'cause usually when you talk about adaptations, it's like, "Man, they really fucked up that Hobbit movie," right?

220
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:40,750
Scott: And certain characters change, right?

221
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:49,061
Scott: But with the manga anime, usually the adaptations, they're not always 100% faithful, but they're super faithful, so the question is, like, "Well, what do you do?

222
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:49,904
Scott: One, both?

223
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:50,847
Scott: The other?

224
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:51,249
Scott: I don't

225
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,389
Scott: know.".

226
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,390
Rym: Well, look at the Fullmetal Alchemist situation.

227
00:14:53,610 --> 00:15:00,669
Rym: We have a show following a manga, but then the show diverges from the manga, because it's coming out faster than the manga.

228
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,230
Scott: Anyway, so, that's a done manga, but I have all the volumes.

229
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:06,548
Scott: I haven't read that.

230
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,910
Rym: But I bring up Fullmetal Alchemist for one reason.

231
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:20,850
Rym: We're gonna talk a lot about Attack on Titan, we'll avoid spoilers, we might spoil some stuff in the very end of the show, we'll warn you, no spoilers yet, but it's really good, I really, really like it, but I'm gonna warn you right now.

232
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:24,350
Rym: This is the Fullmetal Alchemist of this season.

233
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:24,805
Scott: It is.

234
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:25,568
Scott: It is.

235
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,190
Scott: I've been thinking the same thing.

236
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,290
Rym: The Fushigi Yugi of this season.

237
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:30,350
Rym: It is great.

238
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:32,890
Rym: I love every goddamn second of it.

239
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:38,830
Rym: Every episode ends with me going, "Fuck," and waiting seven days to see the next episode, only to go, "Fuck," again.

240
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:41,570
Scott: Even though it's kind of predictable, I know what's gonna happen.

241
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,390
Scott: Yeah, but even then, I predict things, but-- Everything I predicted isn't right so far.

242
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,309
Rym: Yeah, but they're always crook slightly so.

243
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,710
Rym: Like, I expected the plan for most of these episode to not work out.

244
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,830
Scott: I don't know how the actual, how things are gonna play out.

245
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,350
Scott: I just know what the facts are of certain things.

246
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,850
Rym: Well, I knew this plan was gonna fail, because the preview of the previous episode.

247
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:08,110
Rym: You can tell when a show is like this when I watch the previews built into the show, 'cause usually, I have a policy of not watching them.

248
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,750
Rym: All my whole anime life, I have not watched the previews.

249
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:13,770
Scott: I watch them sometimes.

250
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:14,970
Rym: You know when I watch previews?

251
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,209
Rym: The second time I watch a show.

252
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,847
Scott: Initial D. Don't miss it.

253
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:28,330
Rym: But seriously, the reason this show is a Fullmetal Alchemist is because Fullmetal Alchemist, Fushigi Yugi, Attack on Titan have a very common set of traits.

254
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:38,710
Rym: One, the plot is really interesting, to the point that I have a strong desire to find out all the proper nouns and verbs.

255
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,490
Rym: I wanna know what the fucking titans are.

256
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,550
Rym: I wanna know what alchemy is.

257
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,489
Rym: I wanna know if Mikasa will ever shut the fuck up.

258
00:16:48,013 --> 00:16:48,547
Rym: Time of hope.

259
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:49,945
Rym: But, Miyaka.

260
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:58,190
Rym: But two, I don't have any desire to re-watch the show.

261
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,410
Scott: No, it's like Attack on Titan.

262
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:03,130
Scott: It's like, I read the volume, it's like, done, right?

263
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:13,409
Scott: And that's how I can sorta get a tell feeling that, yeah, Attack on Titan, once it's over, and there's no more new animes and no more new mangas, I think it might fade away.

264
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:13,994
Rym: - It will.

265
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:15,150
Scott: - Not to say that it's bad.

266
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,449
Scott: Fullmetal Alchemist isn't bad.

267
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,630
Scott: - And you still see Fullmetal Alchemist cosplays.

268
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,247
Scott: - Okay, yeah.

269
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,730
Scott: Just not nearly as many.

270
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,450
Rym: - Yes, Fushigi Yugi is pretty much gone at this point.

271
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,810
Scott: - Not like Monika, which, it's like, I watched it, and then I just watched it fucking again.

272
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:29,490
Scott: Watched it again, again.

273
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:36,469
Rym: - And not even that, while we were still watching it, or right after we'd just watched it, we'd meet someone and we're like, oh, you haven't seen Madoka yet?

274
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:36,936
Scott: Here.

275
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,269
Scott: - Let's watch it the hell again.

276
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,369
Rym: - Let's watch the first three episodes right now.

277
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:41,990
Rym: I do that with Giant Robo.

278
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,349
Rym: I'll do that with Escaflowne.

279
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,470
Rym: I have not done that with Attack on Titan.

280
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,450
Rym: When I meet someone who hasn't seen it, who should.

281
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,429
Scott: - Just like, yeah, go see it.

282
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,529
Rym: - You know what, yeah, I say, oh, go watch it and tell me when you've caught up, and then we'll talk about it.

283
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,610
Rym: I have no desire to watch any episode of it again.

284
00:17:55,831 --> 00:18:01,702
Rym: I might watch an individual scene again, because the scenes are really well animated and really well done, but.

285
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,449
Scott: - I watched the opener, 'cause that music, the first opener.

286
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,930
Rym: - Yeah, you know what that song is?

287
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,535
Rym: - Second opener's.

288
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:09,070
Scott: not bad, but first opener.

289
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,430
Rym: - Most people, because that opener.

290
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,070
Scott: - There's a reason everyone's remixing that shit.

291
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,130
Rym: - Yes, that's the song you listen to on a loop while you're taking the test, or driving to the con.

292
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:23,450
Rym: (humming) Yeah, most people know that song in their head as mumble a mumble, a mumble a yagger.

293
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,509
Scott: - That's pretty much it.

294
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,570
Rym: ♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪.

295
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,250
Rym: - I do like the second opener a lot.

296
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,790
Scott: - It's good, I like the second opener.

297
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,588
Scott: - But notice again.

298
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,790
Scott: - It's not, it doesn't live up to the second opener, first opener.

299
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,710
Rym: - It's just the same with Full Metal Alchemist.

300
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,090
Rym: The opener kept changing as the show progressed.

301
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,330
Scott: - Yeah, but the second one was better.

302
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,878
Rym: - Gundam C, the opener kept changing as the show progressed.

303
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:42,630
Scott: - The first one was the best.

304
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,108
Scott: - But-- - Utenna?

305
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,090
Rym: - Yeah, well, Utenna only changes twice, once.

306
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,349
Scott: - Oh, that's the closer.

307
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,909
Rym: - Yeah, the closer and opener change.

308
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:58,849
Rym: Sailor Moon changes every season, but with this one, when the opener changes, it's because the show goes to a very different place, and different characters matter a lot.

309
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:05,570
Scott: - I do wanna say the only other openers that I can think of that have the same power, not in terms of just raw quality, right?

310
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,630
Scott: But in terms of-- - All right, power.

311
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:07,561
Rym: We're just talking power.

312
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,270
Scott: - In terms of powerful openings, right?

313
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,102
Scott: It's like, Big O.

314
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:10,529
Rym: - Not Initial D.

315
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,870
Rym: 'Cause Initial D is only powerful for us.

316
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,950
Scott: - No, Initial D is not powerful.

317
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,790
Rym: - It's powerful for us, not for normal people.

318
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,529
Scott: - Obviously Attack on Titan, Big O, Evangelion.

319
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,144
Rym: - Yup.

320
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,049
Rym: Fadin' fast.

321
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:22,653
Rym: - Yeah.

322
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:23,368
Rym: - Madoka, no.

323
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:25,165
Rym: - No, not powerful at all.

324
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:26,358
Rym: - Madoka's the on purpose, not powerful.

325
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:30,649
Scott: - Talking about openers that punch you in the face, like, mm, I'm opening this anime.

326
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:32,700
Scott: Here comes anime.

327
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,010
Rym: - Doom, the game.

328
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,858
Scott: - Yeah.

329
00:19:34,878 --> 00:19:36,430
Rym: - The opening music to the first level.

330
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:37,894
Rym: Oh, man.

331
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,569
Scott: - Anyway, there's not that many, and this is up there.

332
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,208
Rym: - If you have not watched Attack on Titan, here's how I'll sell it to you.

333
00:19:46,670 --> 00:20:00,030
Rym: Attack on Titan is about a world where there are humans, and they recuse themselves behind gigantic walls that they would be hard pressed to build these walls again today.

334
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:08,110
Scott: - Right, like someone just, you know, I knew that there was behind this thing with walls and giants and whatnot, but I didn't realize until I watched the show just how big the walls are, right?

335
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,210
Scott: It's like, you think the walls are Gundam size?

336
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:12,450
Scott: It's like, no, they're Eva-sized walls.

337
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,169
Rym: - Yeah, Avas would have a hard time knocking these walls down.

338
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,229
Scott: - I think an Eva could step over the wall.

339
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,610
Rym: - It would have to vault over the wall.

340
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,409
Scott: - It could do it.

341
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,390
Scott: - It could vault over the wall.

342
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,350
Scott: - The Avas are bigger than Colossal Titan.

343
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,690
Scott: We need to, actually, I think we need to make a JPEG showing Eva versus Colossal Titan size.

344
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,869
Rym: - Without weapons, just an Eva, an Eva would be hard pressed to knock the wall down.

345
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,449
Scott: - An Eva would just punch it down.

346
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,349
Rym: - It would take it a while to punch it down.

347
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,026
Scott: - Maybe.

348
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,370
Rym: - The wall is pretty fucking big.

349
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,789
Scott: - It is, it's made of rock, though.

350
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:51,030
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, the walls are gigantic, and the thing about the walls that's not gigantic is the height, it's really the length, right?

351
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,167
Scott: It's the circumference of the Wall.

352
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:59,290
Scott: Maria, the outer wall, is so gigantic that there's multiple towns and cities.

353
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,369
Scott: It's basically almost the size of a country, a small country.

354
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,390
Scott: I don't know, it's not as big as, say, Luxembourg inside of it, but it's big.

355
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,489
Rym: - Well, here's the thing.

356
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,489
Scott: - There's a lot of land in there.

357
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:20,470
Rym: - There are these concentric sets of walls that are huge that have been around for as long as humanity has historical records available to the general public.

358
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,569
Scott: - Which is really only a few hundred years.

359
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,044
Scott: - Yes.

360
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,710
Scott: - It's not long, they have a short memory.

361
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:34,890
Rym: - As far back as history goes, these walls have been there, and outside of these walls are gigantic, naked fanboys that eat people.

362
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,389
Rym: - Yep.

363
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,990
Rym: - That's the world, that's the plot.

364
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,870
Scott: - Most of the world, you don't even know if this is like an Earth, I mean, it looks like an Earth, it's got forests and trees.

365
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,810
Rym: - I am done comparing shit to Earth.

366
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,790
Rym: People always ask, oh, is it set in a post-apocalyptic Earth or pre-Earth, it doesn't matter.

367
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,010
Rym: The reason stories are set on things like Earth is because that's where we're set.

368
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,509
Scott: - Right, it's some kind of, it's an Earth-like--.

369
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,629
Scott: - It is clearly our Earth or not.

370
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:02,010
Scott: - No, it doesn't, but it's an Earth-like planet, right, in terms of it has forests and trees and whatnot.

371
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,690
Rym: - Which, again, like Fullmetal Alchemist, it's an Earth-like planet, and that's it.

372
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:11,690
Scott: - Yeah, grass, right, but humans supposedly don't know what's far away outside the walls.

373
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,128
Scott: They've only been outside the walls like 50 times ever.

374
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:15,269
Scott: - Yes.

375
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,723
Rym: In fact, the people that--.

376
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:19,590
Scott: - And usually, most of the people who go out come back dead or always.

377
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,421
Rym: - Now, that's the world of the show.

378
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,801
Rym: There are these gigantic, horrifyingly disturbing giants that eat people.

379
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:29,709
Scott: - And they're super, you basically can't beat them.

380
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,438
Scott: They're super dangerous.

381
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:31,149
Rym: - They're mindless and scary.

382
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:32,830
Rym: Like when humans tangle with Titans.

383
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,066
Scott: - It's like fast zombies.

384
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:34,289
Scott: - Yes.

385
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,809
Scott: - You can't, you know what you can do.

386
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,530
Rym: - But it's not just fast zombies.

387
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,260
Rym: Imagine fast zombies--.

388
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,870
Rym: - Fast giant zombies.

389
00:22:38,211 --> 00:22:40,430
Rym: - That are 30, 40 meters tall.

390
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,550
Scott: - Well, there's some that are only five meters tall, which is still gigantic, right?

391
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,598
Scott: That's like, you know--.

392
00:22:45,618 --> 00:22:53,250
Rym: - You realize my new joke, to this day, my new joke, at every con when a fanboy is approaching us at a table is going to be two-meter Titan incoming.

393
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,362
Scott: - Yeah, right?

394
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:54,829
Rym: - Two-meter class.

395
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,368
Scott: - Now, think about this, right?

396
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,570
Scott: Shaq is huge, right?

397
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,090
Scott: If you see Shaq coming, you're like, "Oh, fuck me," right?

398
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:01,748
Scott: That guy's huge.

399
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:05,110
Scott: The smallest Titan is like two Shaqs tall.

400
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:08,290
Scott: It's like, just kill yourself, right?

401
00:23:08,713 --> 00:23:10,770
Scott: You're not gonna beat him, especially at basketball.

402
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:18,390
Rym: - Yep, but the Titans are huge and unbeatable, and the plot of the show begins right away.

403
00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:20,190
Rym: You've got a bunch of characters doing their stuff.

404
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,270
Scott: - They're not unbeatable individually, but they're unbeatable collectively.

405
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,930
Scott: - There's a military-- - There's so many of them, they can't beat him.

406
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:33,130
Rym: - And there's a military, and they do the expeditions, people die, but basically the world is pretty stable.

407
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,689
Rym: Titans have not been a serious threat inside of the walls for over a hundred years.

408
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:49,988
Scott: - Yep, basically the wall is big enough that even the biggest Titans can't get through it, so the humans live happily inside the walls, and just defend just in case, looking out over the walls to make sure Titans don't get in.

409
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:58,189
Rym: - And then one day, a gigantic fucking Titan bigger than anyone has ever seen just appears and fucking kicks one of the walls down.

410
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,170
Scott: - What the fuck?

411
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,110
Rym: - Oh, shit.

412
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,329
Scott: - Oh, shit, it's on.

413
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:10,544
Rym: - And I can't spoil anything else, because this is a show like Fullmetal Alchemist where a lot of the enjoyment of watching the show is the, "Oh, fuck, did that just

414
00:24:10,605 --> 00:24:10,928
Rym: happen?".

415
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,930
Rym: - So don't read ahead in spoilers and crap.

416
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:30,009
Scott: - It doesn't matter, because the thing is, a lot of the stuff is just so plainly obvious that even if you don't, for example, right, there's a, in addition to the colossal Titan, there's another Titan called the armored Titan, and you look at him and he has this hair.

417
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,330
Scott: - And then later-- - And then there's another character who has the same exact goddamn hair.

418
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:42,730
Scott: Now it's like, have I actually seen anything in the manga or anime that 100% verifies that that character and that Titan are related?

419
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,689
Scott: No, but you know what?

420
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:50,042
Scott: I will bet my entire wallet, which actually has a lot of money in it right now, that that guy is that Titan.

421
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:52,110
Scott: They have the same goddamn hair.

422
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,110
Scott: They're just giving it away.

423
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:54,730
Scott: It's a freebie, right?

424
00:24:55,272 --> 00:24:58,329
Scott: And there's another one just like that, two characters that look exact.

425
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:05,130
Scott: It's like there's so many things just given away, but there are also things that are not given away, like the colossal Titan itself.

426
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:07,489
Scott: There isn't a character that looks like that.

427
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,529
Scott: I'm guessing.

428
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:09,729
Rym: - It's King Bradley.

429
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,509
Scott: - It's gotta be King Bradley.

430
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,210
Scott: It's like the Akio, right?

431
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,660
Scott: A character revealed later, or it could be, it can't be, I thought it was Pyxis.

432
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:22,570
Scott: 'cause he was bald, and the colossal Titan is also bald, but there's a scene where the colossal--.

433
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,028
Rym: - Ah, forget that.

434
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,929
Rym: Pyxis is just too cool.

435
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:31,149
Scott: - Pyxis is too cool, but they showed the colossal Titan attacking while Pyxis is simultaneously playing chess with some noble.

436
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,270
Rym: - Pyxis is one of my favorite minor characters.

437
00:25:35,215 --> 00:25:38,330
Rym: He's that badass in the background that we love so much.

438
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:44,130
Scott: Another thing about this show is it sorta has these arcs in a sense, right?

439
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:57,970
Scott: That's why the opener changed, and the manga's the same way, where the beginning of the show is sorta like the intro, and then there's a whole sequence of the training, and it's sorta like the main characters are in the military, training, and then eventually joining the actual military.

440
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:02,050
Scott: So the whole first part of the show, while things go down, is the training.

441
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:10,870
Scott: Then once they join the military, the opener changes, the characters change, all the characters that are in the town are left behind, and now we're focusing on the outside.

442
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:23,090
Scott: The only characters that stick with you are the few central ones that were in the training that are now trained, and all these secondary characters swap out, and they're not dead, most of them anyway, right?

443
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:23,907
Scott: Well, some of them.

444
00:26:24,573 --> 00:26:27,269
Scott: People dying all over the place, and there's giants eating everybody, right?

445
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:31,710
Scott: But the main characters basically move from one group of friends to another.

446
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,590
Scott: It's sorta like graduating from high school to college.

447
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,030
Rym: - But that's the interesting thing about the show.

448
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:46,310
Rym: It moves quickly like this, and the characters we're focusing on, it jumps around a lot, and it's perfectly willing to leave major characters by the wayside for a long time.

449
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,609
Scott: - Right, and also kill people.

450
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:47,987
Scott: - Yes.

451
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:55,689
Scott: - It makes, though, they achieve the goal of making the world super dangerous by fuckin' killin' people off, L-O-G-H style, give 'em a name, now they're dead.

452
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,430
Scott: - Yep, but the thing is, they won't kill everybody.

453
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:05,883
Scott: - And at the same time, it also achieves the Urasawa thing of introduce a new character, make you care about them right away, as opposed to, "Oh, these new characters, "I don't care about

454
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:06,149
Scott: them.".

455
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:06,648
Scott: Yes, you do.

456
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:17,288
Rym: - The show just does a really good job of driving home the point that a lot of people are dying, and that every one of these people is just as cool as the main characters, and it's--.

457
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,450
Scott: - And even the most badass people are all fuckin' scared to shit of titans.

458
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,210
Rym: - And a lot of the badass people also just fuckin' die.

459
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:24,556
Rym: - Yep.

460
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:25,170
Rym: - Out of nowhere.

461
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,430
Scott: - Super badasses who seemed invincible.

462
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,929
Rym: - Characters that you would be like if you were watching "Utena," and Mickey just dies in a duel.

463
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:38,130
Scott: - Yep, well, the thing about it, there's that guy who's got the gray hair, who has such a high titan kill count, but he's super annoying.

464
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,669
Scott: I'm so sure that guy's gonna die.

465
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,709
Rym: - No, I don't think he's gonna die.

466
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,004
Scott: - He's gonna get killed, so--.

467
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,390
Rym: - I think characters I care more about are gonna die.

468
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,730
Scott: - That guy is the perfect guy to get killed.

469
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,329
Rym: - Nah.

470
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,429
Scott: - Also the girl he's always arguing with.

471
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,730
Rym: - My favorite character in the show is the scientist girl who studies the titans.

472
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,109
Scott: - I don't know if she'll die.

473
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,790
Rym: - No, I'm saying she's my favorite character.

474
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:04,465
Rym: 'Cause she's just kinda like the Fluttershy-looking girl in "Little Witch

475
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:05,009
Rym: Academia.".

476
00:28:05,552 --> 00:28:12,030
Rym: She's creepy, and there's a great scene where she's like, you wanna hear about my experiments on titans?

477
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:14,070
Rym: Let me tell you about them.

478
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:20,069
Rym: And then all these badasses who have seen bloodshed and death for much of their lives are like, I'm gonna be ill, I'm gonna leave the room.

479
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:29,149
Scott: - I think my, I don't know what my favorite character is, but Levi is basically, he is the King Cosma of "Attack on

480
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:29,450
Scott: Titan.".

481
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:43,030
Rym: - Well, there's a scene where he beats the main character up, and it's one of those scenes where it's not necessarily particularly especially violent, especially in a show where people are getting crushed and eaten and bitten left and right.

482
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:50,389
Rym: But then this one scene where a human just physically punches up another human is so brutal to watch.

483
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,089
Scott: - Yep.

484
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,930
Rym: - It's almost hard to watch.

485
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:56,770
Scott: - I think my favorite character, as usual, are like the secret characters, right?

486
00:28:57,293 --> 00:29:04,830
Scott: There was a trial in the show, and the guy who comes to basically be the judge of the trial 'cause it was a military trial, was the head of the entire military, all three branches.

487
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,467
Rym: - That's either gonna be a super--.

488
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,710
Scott: - That guy's one step away from the king, and he was super just and awesome, so that guy is like-- -.

489
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:15,509
Rym: That either means-- - That's the kinda guy like-- - He's a King Bradley, or he's a good guy.

490
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,770
Scott: - He could be a good guy, but basically he's one step away from the king.

491
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:24,910
Scott: He's the head of the whole military, the five-star general, the chief of the joint chief, the secretary of defense.

492
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,088
Scott: He's the number one guy.

493
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,610
Rym: - I really like Erwin, but I'm pretty sure he's gonna die at some point.

494
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:33,290
Scott: - I don't know, Erwin's cool, but Erwin's also got a lot of mystery.

495
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:40,150
Rym: - The show also gets points when you learn about character backstories that the backstories are not what you would expect.

496
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:40,550
Scott: - Nope.

497
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:53,089
Rym: - Characters have pretty rough paths, and a lot of this is really just shown to you along the way like, oh, that guy, yeah, his family was sent off to die outside the walls because there wasn't enough food.

498
00:29:53,654 --> 00:29:54,510
Rym: We get that in a flashback.

499
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,090
Scott: - I also like how the focus moves around a lot.

500
00:29:57,351 --> 00:30:02,749
Scott: Like Mikasa is a major character overall, but in the more recent episodes, basically you hardly see her at all.

501
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,429
Scott: - Yeah, it's all about Erwin and Eren.

502
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:10,701
Scott: - Yeah, there's almost no focus on her right now 'cause she's not important right now, but I'm sure she's gonna get back into it in the next episode.

503
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:14,870
Scott: because they showed, she got like one scene of like, oh, Eren must be that way, I'm going.

504
00:30:15,252 --> 00:30:16,410
Scott: So she's heading into the fray.

505
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,969
Rym: - She's also the last Asian.

506
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,008
Scott: - That's true.

507
00:30:21,577 --> 00:30:25,969
Scott: All right, but yeah, there's a reason, you know, everyone's talking about this show because of the hot show right now.

508
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,870
Scott: Will it have long staying power?

509
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:28,670
Rym: - Definitely not.

510
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:39,230
Scott: - Probably not, most likely, but, you know, Fullmetal Alchemist, if you haven't seen it, is still worth watching now, but it's just, you know, it's just not as great as, you know, anything else.

511
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,968
Scott: So Attack on Titan's the kind of thing you watch once and that's it.

512
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:46,870
Rym: - Perennially, there are these blockbuster anime that everyone watches together in the anime world.

513
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,550
Rym: They're super good, but they're just not particularly memorable beyond that.

514
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,970
Scott: - This is not gonna be an all time great anime, it's just a good anime that's hot right now.

515
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,608
Rym: - I feel like these shows string you along because you really, really need to know all the proper nouns.

516
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,648
Rym: You really wanna know what the Titans are and where they come from.

517
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:07,987
Rym: And the show does a good job of teaching you about the Titans as they're--.

518
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,505
Scott: - But like 10 years from now when someone says, "What great anime should I

519
00:31:11,545 --> 00:31:11,829
Scott: watch?"

520
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:13,630
Scott: No one's gonna say Attack on Titan.

521
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:16,703
Rym: Unless they're getting into the list of, "Oh, you should watch a

522
00:31:16,723 --> 00:31:16,887
Rym: blog.".

523
00:31:17,131 --> 00:31:24,401
Rym: You know how we do panels, we're like, "Yeah, you should all watch Fushigi Yugi "to know what blockbuster anime were like "in the late 90s, early 2000s in the

524
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:24,461
Rym: US.".

525
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,549
Scott: - I should just go home and watch Madoka again.

526
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:28,909
Rym: - Ah, yeah.

527
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:31,350
Rym: Madoka, Utena, Eva, Escapada.

528
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,470
Scott: - Oh, right, I should watch Utena, we're doing that thing.

529
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,570
Rym: - Yeah, we should do that thing.

530
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,890
Scott: - And I kinda want to real bad.

531
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:46,150
Rym: - Yeah, but all, you know, with the deaths of characters, like to kind of give you an example of how well the show does the kind of arbitrary and capricious nature of the Titans and death.

532
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:52,689
Rym: There's one character who's pretty cool and he just kind of disappears at one point in this big sort of action scene going on.

533
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,990
Scott: - Yeah, there's so many characters that when they don't get scenes--.

534
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,610
Scott: - Like you don't notice.

535
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:06,464
Scott: - You don't notice that they're not, oh, that guy has, I've been paying close attention like who shows up on screen and who doesn't and it's sort of like, I don't want to say this, but it's like a MOBA, like middle is missing, right?

536
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:14,570
Scott: It's like, oh, I haven't seen so, 'cause everyone's got this, you know, maneuver gear and they're flying all over town and fighting Titans all over the place.

537
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,530
Scott: So people are moving real fast, going everywhere.

538
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,550
Scott: It's like everyone's Spider-Man basically.

539
00:32:19,532 --> 00:32:21,510
Rym: And the animation of the Spider-Manning is great.

540
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,430
Scott: - And people are splitting up and grouping together all the time.

541
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,610
Scott: Splitting up and grouping together like D&D parties.

542
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:28,470
Scott: So that are all sort of together.

543
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:32,350
Scott: So it's like, oh, someone, you know, went off.

544
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:36,590
Scott: I haven't seen that person in like 10 minutes and they're not with the people they were with.

545
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,488
Scott: Where are they?

546
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,750
Scott: - So one super badass character-- - Oh, nope, they just showed up again.

547
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,009
Scott: You know, so it's like, sometimes they're dead.

548
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,770
Scott: Sometimes they show up again and do something awesome.

549
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,630
Rym: - Or, oh, they tried to save somebody and got squished.

550
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,090
Rym: But there's one super badass character who you don't notice for a while.

551
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:50,890
Rym: And then later you kind of forget about him.

552
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,310
Rym: And then after this battle, they just find his body.

553
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:55,550
Rym: They don't even know how he died.

554
00:32:56,112 --> 00:32:57,230
Rym: He died alone and anonymous.

555
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,890
Scott: - He wasn't that badass, he was just really nice.

556
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,130
Rym: - He died alone and anonymous and they just found his body.

557
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,430
Rym: No heroic moment, no last words.

558
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,968
Rym: They found his rotting corpse and that's it.

559
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:07,467
Scott: - Yup.

560
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:15,827
Rym: And the physiology and the mystery of the titans and how they work and why they eat people and what happens to people they eat is all just--.

561
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:16,950
Scott: - Terrible Secret of Space.

562
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:17,579
Scott: - Really interesting.

563
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,970
Scott: - The greatest thing in all of anime, the Terrible Secret of Space.

564
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,990
Rym: - But there's two kinds of Terrible Secret of Space shows.

565
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:27,210
Rym: This is the show where the Terrible Secret of Space is 80% of why you're watching the show.

566
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:28,018
Rym: You'll wanna know.

567
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:31,630
Scott: - Any show that has a Terrible Secret of Space, that's gonna be the reason I'm watching.

568
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,321
Rym: - And the other 20% is just.

569
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:34,430
Rym: the characters are really good.

570
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:38,289
Rym: They usually act really smartly or sometimes they fuck up.

571
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,150
Scott: - There's never a case where it's like, oh man, why is someone so stupid?

572
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:51,247
Scott: Because if they need to make someone do something dumb, they don't have to make the person dumb 'cause the titans are just so dangerous and the people are freaking out.

573
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:54,809
Scott: 'cause yeah, giant titans just bit your friend's legs off and they're crawling at you.

574
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:59,070
Scott: So they never have to make someone dumb as an excuse for them to do something.

575
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,369
Scott: that is not the best thing.

576
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,606
Scott: They just make the person emotionally freaking out.

577
00:34:05,552 --> 00:34:09,190
Scott: or yeah, the person was really good and did the smart thing, but it's just not good enough.

578
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,589
Scott: 'cause the titans are that dangerous.

579
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:15,670
Scott: You never hate on characters for anything like that.

580
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:27,768
Rym: - Now, it's obvious based on the progression of the manga and the fact that there's a one 26 episode season of this, that season one is going to be like the end of season one of Gundam Sea.

581
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,121
Scott: - And if they don't continue.

582
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:30,090
Rym: - Or Full Metal Alchemist.

583
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,590
Scott: - Yeah, if they don't continue.

584
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,449
Rym: - I think they will.

585
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,750
Rym: I think the show is really popular.

586
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:38,909
Scott: - The anime, you're just gonna have to read the manga and the thing with the manga is it will get you all your answers, right?

587
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:49,630
Scott: And they're gonna actually, in the US, they're gonna start putting out one volume per month and catch the fuck up right away 'cause they realized they're striking the iron while it's hot, but it's just not as good as the anime.

588
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,250
Scott: It's the same story, but the craftsmanship of the manga is flawed.

589
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,873
Scott: There's some bad art and I don't mean bad art like.

590
00:34:55,975 --> 00:35:02,450
Scott: it's a style I don't like 'cause I actually do like the style that is different, but it's like, oh, the anatomy is all fucked in that panel.

591
00:35:02,692 --> 00:35:06,076
Scott: Oh, that person had totally the wrong facial expression in that panel.

592
00:35:06,117 --> 00:35:09,750
Scott: that didn't really make it look like the feeling that they were supposed to be having.

593
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,930
Rym: - Yep, now the anime does a good job.

594
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,270
Scott: - Oh, these panels are in the wrong order.

595
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:12,596
Rym: Oh, I can't--.

596
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:18,190
Rym: - The anime does a good job of taking that sort of sunken eye socket, like there's all these weird faces that the characters have.

597
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:20,910
Rym: The anime does a good job of using that to great effect.

598
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,050
Scott: - But it uses it lightly.

599
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:33,109
Scott: It's like the anime has more of an, I don't wanna say normal anime style, but a style that has more in common with, say, Full Metal Alchemist kind of style, right?

600
00:35:33,571 --> 00:35:39,209
Scott: But it sort of still applies a light veneer of the manga style instead of going heavy on it.

601
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,566
Scott: And it makes it more, I guess, intelligible to figure out what the hell's going on.

602
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:51,289
Scott: And also the action sequences are the exact opposite of Akira, which is the best action sequences of any manga ever.

603
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:57,010
Scott: It's like you can't even tell what the person's doing with the Titan until it's over and you're like, oh, he beat it, oh, he died.

604
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,229
Rym: - I think you were the one who was like, it's kinda like Naito.

605
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,470
Scott: - Yeah, it's a little bit like the Trigun manga.

606
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,749
Scott: It was like you flip through a Trigun manga action scene.

607
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,870
Rym: - It's like you're on one page.

608
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,509
Scott: - You don't know who's shooting who, and at the end it's like, okay, Wolfwood won.

609
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,370
Rym: - Yeah, like you're on a page and something's happening.

610
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:14,970
Rym: You flip to the next page and you're like, oh, I must have skipped a bunch of pages 'cause the pages were stuck together.

611
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,030
Rym: And you flip back and nope, you didn't skip any pages.

612
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:18,410
Scott: - Nope.

613
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,489
Rym: - That's just what was on the next page.

614
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:20,927
Scott: - Yep.

615
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,510
Rym: - The backgrounds in the show and the skies are just ridiculous.

616
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,810
Rym: They remind me of Makoto Shinkai skies.

617
00:36:30,534 --> 00:36:33,770
Rym: I love everything about this show, but I love it in the same way I love Fullmetal Alchemist.

618
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:38,910
Rym: It was my number one priority in life while FMA was coming out to see new episodes.

619
00:36:39,812 --> 00:36:43,449
Rym: And I have not watched it again and I have no plans to ever watch it again.

620
00:36:45,051 --> 00:36:47,675
Rym: But yeah, we'll do a final thoughts-y show once it's done.

621
00:36:47,736 --> 00:36:50,210
Rym: done because the plot might be dumb.

622
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:51,205
Rym: We don't know.

623
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,709
Scott: - Yeah, I mean, the terrible secret of space could be a dumb secret of space.

624
00:36:55,391 --> 00:36:59,750
Scott: As soon as a dumb thing is revealed, you're really anxious to learn this horrible secret.

625
00:37:00,714 --> 00:37:05,450
Scott: There's a whole thing about, there's a basement the main character has a key to, and it's like, what's in the basement?

626
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,670
Scott: And I'm sure we'll eventually find out what's in the basement.

627
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:11,070
Scott: But if something dumb is in the basement-- - It's just his dad's porn collection.

628
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,430
Rym: - Yeah, if there's something-- - Like in Staring Up at the Half Moon.

629
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:18,189
Scott: - Yeah, if there's something dumb in the basement, that could actually sort of flop the whole show.

630
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:24,249
Scott: It'd be like, yeah, it's worth watching up until the basement to just stop 'cause then that'll sort of ruin everything else that happened before it.

631
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,830
Scott: It's like, oh, I'm anticipating this present.

632
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,830
Scott: Oh, my anticipation feels so good.

633
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:30,848
Scott: It feels so good.

634
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:31,830
Scott: I wanna open the present.

635
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,790
Scott: I'm feeling real good with all this anticipation.

636
00:37:34,312 --> 00:37:35,110
Scott: I'm opening the present.

637
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,469
Scott: I'm feeling really good opening this present 'cause it's so fun, and I'm finally letting my anticipation go.

638
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:43,470
Scott: I've gotten some hype, and then I open it, and it's like some fucking underwear.

639
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,550
Scott: And now all that was ruined.

640
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:51,710
Scott: I had good feelings, but now I have shit feelings, and that sort of ruins those good feelings even though I already had them.

641
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,390
Scott: So you should not open the present.

642
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:57,189
Rym: - At the same time, the show could escalate into Ava territory.

643
00:37:57,952 --> 00:38:00,850
Rym: if the Secret of Space is so transcendently good.

644
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,489
Scott: - It's not gonna happen.

645
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,570
Rym: - No, but there's a chance.

646
00:38:03,392 --> 00:38:04,030
Scott: It's not possible.

647
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:04,989
Rym: - There's a chance.

648
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:05,455
Scott: - Impossible.

649
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:06,290
Scott: - There's always a chance.

650
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,770
Scott: - Impossible.

651
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,829
Rym: - So yeah, watch your Attack on Titan.

652
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,400
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

653
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:23,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

654
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,960
Scott: - Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

655
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,879
Rym: - Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

656
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:36,599
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

658
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,399
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

659
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,560
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
