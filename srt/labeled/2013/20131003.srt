1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,705
Rym: It's Thursday, October 3rd, 2013.

2
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:11,951
Rym: I'm Riff, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,042
Scott: No it's not.

4
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,551
Scott: Tonight we're shut down.

5
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:20,378
Scott: Shut down the GeekNights.

6
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:21,000
Scott: Going to get dinner.

7
00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:31,140
Rym: I'm just surprised that Scott actually wants to talk about something even remotely related to politics.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:31,761
Scott: I don't.

9
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:38,600
Scott: I'm just indulging you and then I expect next week, well two weeks from now, to be indulged.

10
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:39,844
Rym: No, uh oh.

11
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:43,576
Rym: What could you possibly want me to talk about?

12
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:44,700
Scott: I don't know, I'm thinking about it.

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,546
Rym: That I wouldn't want to talk about.

14
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:49,740
Scott: If I had something, we would already be doing that as the episode.

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,090
Rym: See, that's the trouble with this tit for tat.

16
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,200
Rym: If you help me out first, I am under no obligation.

17
00:00:57,321 --> 00:00:58,730
Rym: Unless you shut GeekNights down.

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,079
Scott: I can shut it down.

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:17,198
Rym: Anyway, so as you guys know I was in Istanbul again and I noticed something about traveling to a place like that and working multiple times in a row.

20
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:26,069
Rym: is that there's sort of, like the first time I went everything was new and strange and I spent a lot of my time learning and going to a neighborhood and trying to explore it.

21
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:38,510
Rym: Like the first time I rode the subway, I walked down into the subway and I looked at the map and then I looked at the token machine and then I tried to figure everything out and like really understand what I was doing.

22
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:44,090
Rym: And the second time I went to Istanbul, I had a sort of false sense of knowledge.

23
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:49,865
Rym: That oh, I've been here before, I know how shit goes down and I stayed in the same neighborhood.

24
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:51,650
Rym: so I knew that neighborhood really well.

25
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:57,470
Rym: and as a result, I got lost every time I left that neighborhood because I thought I knew where I was going better than I did.

26
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:03,410
Rym: But then now that I've been there several times, I actually got my way around Istanbul.

27
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,918
Rym: Like I rode the subway every day to work commuting.

28
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:11,029
Rym: I lived in like a little neighborhood more downtown near normal people.

29
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:20,290
Rym: Like I lived in the Long Island City instead of the last few times when I lived in the equivalent of like Forest Hills.

30
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,550
Scott: Why don't you just live in the Ritz-Carlton?

31
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:27,969
Rym: I'm not going to waste that much of my company's money just yet.

32
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,449
Scott: The company who gives a shit?

33
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,384
Rym: Because I kind of have a vested interest in the company and that money.

34
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,710
Rym: That money is kind of my money too.

35
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,334
Scott: Yeah, I want to set a good impression.

36
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:41,130
Scott: Make it look like, you know, that's why, you know, financial people always drive fancy cars.

37
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:41,451
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

38
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:42,012
Rym: So you know what?

39
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:42,935
Rym: Here's an aside.

40
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:48,090
Rym: I realized, one, one of the meetings I got, the people there knew GeekNights.

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:48,890
Scott: What?

42
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:53,506
Rym: They saw it on my LinkedIn profile and they brought it up because they listened to it.

43
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:59,430
Rym: And these guys were super cool and super nerdy and everything about them was awesome.

44
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:14,440
Rym: But basically, the impression I'm getting, the more I do the work that I do, is that every other company that does financially stock market stuff, they have salespeople who only do sales.

45
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,427
Rym: Their job is I am sales guy.

46
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,770
Rym: I sell you thing.

47
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,921
Scott: That's, yep.

48
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:22,570
Scott: You mean every company ever?

49
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,121
Rym: Yeah, so that doesn't work in a technical field so much.

50
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,710
Rym: Or when it does work, it doesn't actually end well.

51
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,857
Scott: Well, it doesn't work if you're trying to sell to nerdy people.

52
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:38,810
Scott: The thing is usually, you know, take for example, you know, a normal work, right?

53
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:45,030
Scott: People who are not technical often get an opportunity to make a technical purchasing decision.

54
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,210
Scott: For example, who decides whether to use Salesforce or some open source.

55
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,369
Rym: Ah, now in both companies I've worked at, me.

56
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,380
Scott: Yeah, but at most companies it would be the head of sales guy.

57
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,282
Scott: So, right?

58
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:01,890
Scott: It wouldn't be the CTO deciding which thing to use.

59
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,130
Scott: It would be the guy who's actually going to end up using that software.

60
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,730
Scott: Who decides what to use for the HR management thing that everyone logs into to, you know, log their time off hours.

61
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,990
Scott: The HR person would decide that and that salesperson has to sell the HR person.

62
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:21,605
Scott: The salespeople, their job, what they do works on those sorts of people.

63
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:23,130
Scott: It doesn't work on CTOs.

64
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:33,270
Scott: So, if you need to sell somebody, say, I don't know, like Barracuda network sells their stupid, you know, useless routers spam filter things that suck ass.

65
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:42,070
Scott: That you need a person who can sell something to a CTO unless you're trying to sell to a company that doesn't even have a CTO, which is a lot of companies.

66
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:50,790
Scott: They don't have any tech people in house whatsoever and they just buy things that do stuff automatically and will like outsource and like the vendor will set it up.

67
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,101
Scott: Sort of like when you pay someone to set up the copy machine in the office.

68
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:56,329
Scott: You don't have anyone in the office who can service it.

69
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:09,760
Rym: So what I'm noticing is that in the circles I'm in, the financials, there's a lot of younger people who are getting into these positions and they're all technical but ended up doing less technical jobs.

70
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:16,250
Rym: Or the tech people are getting to make the decisions because the tech people are increasingly invaluable.

71
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:25,110
Rym: I've seen companies where the one guy who knows about like the kind of fixed stuff that I know leaves and then the company's fucked because literally no one else knows how it works.

72
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:35,024
Rym: So increasingly I'm succeeding at sales because I show up with like a sales guy, like me and the chairman or something.

73
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:38,650
Rym: show up to a company and we talk to them and we're both also technical.

74
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:43,680
Rym: So when the guy asks the question like, yeah, so could we just like integrate that to our JMS whatever?

75
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,522
Rym: We're like, yeah.

76
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:46,025
Rym: And we start talking about the APIs.

77
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:48,130
Rym: No one else does that.

78
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,128
Scott: Of course not.

79
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:49,711
Scott: Yeah.

80
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:52,889
Rym: So it's kind of cool that I get to do that and it's all working out.

81
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:54,253
Rym: But anyway, I digress.

82
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,522
Rym: Istanbul was awesome, but long flights.

83
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:00,069
Rym: I flew Turkish Air, which has...

84
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:01,243
Scott: Is that all luxury?

85
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:01,710
Scott: First class?

86
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:02,872
Rym: No, coach.

87
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:04,375
Rym: So I'm going to tell you all a secret.

88
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:09,869
Rym: If you eat food on an airplane and it's shitty, which is all the time...

89
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,950
Scott: You know, that flight, food on the Qantas was better than I expected.

90
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,409
Scott: It was okay, but it was good.

91
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,550
Scott: I looked forward to it because I was hungry.

92
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,212
Rym: Oh my God.

93
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:19,214
Rym: I was so hungry.

94
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:21,299
Rym: We got to fucking L.A.

95
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,406
Rym: and we didn't have enough time to do anything before we got to the next flight.

96
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,010
Rym: I was so hungry.

97
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,004
Rym: But like I was waiting, like when I saw the food trucks coming out, I was like, ah, ah, ah.

98
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:33,849
Rym: I just walked over like taking one.

99
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:42,370
Rym: But Turkish Airlines in coach has better food than I buy for lunch on an average day in New York.

100
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:43,117
Scott: There you go.

101
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,229
Scott: Is it Turkish food?

102
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:45,861
Rym: Sort of.

103
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:46,449
Rym: Some of it.

104
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:47,047
Scott: What did you eat?

105
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,949
Rym: A bunch of different meals.

106
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:49,588
Scott: What were they?

107
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:51,850
Rym: So one of them was just this pasta thing that I got.

108
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:53,299
Rym: One of them was...

109
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,821
Scott: I'm hungry right now.

110
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:55,390
Scott: This is not good.

111
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,670
Rym: This isn't a good conversation you had.

112
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,487
Rym: One of them was this sort of like artichoke thing as one dish.

113
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:04,924
Rym: And that like artichoke marinated in olive oil.

114
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:05,850
Rym: Oh my God, it was so good.

115
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,979
Rym: And then this other piece was like a salad.

116
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,929
Rym: It was a good salad with feta cheese and stuff on it.

117
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,009
Rym: The main dish was like this chicken thing and this beef thing.

118
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,450
Scott: Who's the chef for Turkish Air?

119
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:16,489
Rym: I don't know.

120
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,668
Scott: You can look that shit up.

121
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:28,687
Rym: But what I'm saying is that the coach food, the cheapest seat food on Turkish Airlines is better than the business class food on any U.S.

122
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:29,730
Rym: domestic airline.

123
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:34,088
Rym: And the comfort class and business class food on Turkish Air...

124
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,123
Scott: Must have been like...

125
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:39,330
Rym: We're talking salt and fat level of quality.

126
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,650
Rym: Like, good God.

127
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:43,981
Rym: So seriously, United,

128
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:44,865
Rym: U.S.,

129
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:45,730
Rym: what the fuck?

130
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,850
Rym: How can you fuck up pasta so bad if Turkish Airlines in coach...

131
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,810
Scott: Because good pasta costs more money and they're already not profitable.

132
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,989
Rym: Maybe we should stop subsidizing these assholes anyway.

133
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,570
Scott: Yeah, that's a good question, right?

134
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,369
Scott: It's like we subsidize all our stupid airlines and they suck, right?

135
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,550
Scott: Does Turkey subsidize Turkish Air?

136
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:05,656
Scott: Because the U.S.

137
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:07,308
Scott: doesn't subsidize Turkish Air, does it?

138
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:08,835
Scott: Right?

139
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:09,666
Scott: I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

140
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:11,990
Scott: So is it profitable, Turkish Air?

141
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:14,069
Scott: You know, how about Lufthansa?

142
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:15,989
Scott: Do they subsidize Lufthansa?

143
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:23,518
Rym: So another thing I learned, just kind of bear in mind, if you ever think that you're going to do a transfer at Heathrow, don't fucking do it.

144
00:08:24,022 --> 00:08:24,567
Rym: Don't do it.

145
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:33,232
Rym: I landed at Terminal 5 and was transferring to a flight leaving from Terminal 5.

146
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:35,730
Rym: You have to go through security for that to happen.

147
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,168
Scott: Of course.

148
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,789
Rym: There were two international flights.

149
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,765
Scott: Lufthansa is about as worse at security than the

150
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:42,187
Scott: U.S.,

151
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:42,730
Scott: pretty much.

152
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,050
Rym: The security was pretty bad in Heathrow.

153
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:51,348
Rym: And then later, this really nice British lady came down and sat next to me and she was like, "Can I interview you about your experiences in our

154
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:51,750
Rym: airport?".

155
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:53,738
Rym: And I was like, "Are you sure?

156
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:56,370
Rym: Are you sure you want to sit down next to me?

157
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:57,054
Rym: How long will this

158
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:57,276
Rym: take?".

159
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:58,667
Rym: And she was like, "I don't know, about a half

160
00:08:58,707 --> 00:08:58,949
Rym: hour.".

161
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:00,282
Rym: And I was like, "All

162
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:00,504
Rym: right.".

163
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:03,109
Rym: And she seemed kind of taken aback that I said yes.

164
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,607
Rym: And yeah, I...

165
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:07,250
Scott: Where was she from?

166
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:08,559
Rym: She worked there.

167
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,949
Rym: She lives in Albion, I guess.

168
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,310
Scott: Oh, but she worked for the airport?

169
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:11,622
Scott: Yeah.

170
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,130
Scott: Oh, she didn't work for the Guardian or something?

171
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,350
Rym: No, she worked for the airport.

172
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,723
Scott: Yeah, and you were like, "Your airport is

173
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:17,128
Scott: awful.".

174
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:21,024
Rym: No, I was like, "Everything about your airport is great, except your security is ridiculous

175
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:21,347
Rym: theater.".

176
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,910
Rym: Also, I missed my flight and I was stuck here for seven fucking hours.

177
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:27,580
Rym: And all you gave me was a 20-pound voucher.

178
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,629
Rym: But let me tell you, I drank a whole lot of beer.

179
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:33,962
Scott: For 20 pounds?

180
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,870
Rym: I drank 20 pounds worth of beer and then got on another flight.

181
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,449
Scott: Couldn't one beer in an airport be like five pounds at least?

182
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:40,730
Scott: I don't know.

183
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,830
Scott: Oh, pounds are worth a lot, right?

184
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,014
Scott: Yeah.

185
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:43,188
Scott: They don't suck.

186
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,610
Rym: Also, it's Britain, beer is kind of cheap and it was pretty good beer.

187
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:48,210
Scott: Even in the airport, it's not overpriced?

188
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:48,769
Scott: No, it really wasn't.

189
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,069
Scott: Why didn't you take the 20 pounds to the duty-free?

190
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:54,970
Rym: I really just didn't want to.

191
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,304
Rym: I think dirty-free is a ridiculous scam/joke.

192
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,170
Scott: Sure, but it's, you know, you just got free money and pounds are worth a lot, so you could have gotten something good.

193
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,530
Rym: Yeah, I spent that free money drinking beer and hanging out for an entire day.

194
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,290
Scott: You could have gotten something better, like free electronics.

195
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,029
Rym: And playing FTL on my laptop.

196
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:12,909
Scott: Just FTL?

197
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:17,209
Rym: And SIP-5, because I happened to have a charger with me that worked because I was on my way to Turkey.

198
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:17,829
Rym: All right.

199
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,250
Rym: But I watched three movies on the way back.

200
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,028
Scott: Daddy three movies.

201
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,929
Rym: Because the screens on Turkish air are HD.

202
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:25,809
Scott: Beautiful, okay.

203
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:26,428
Rym: It was great.

204
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:28,949
Rym: It was amazing, not like those JetBlue things.

205
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,697
Scott: What kind of airplane was this, 787?

206
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,230
Rym: I don't remember.

207
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,810
Rym: Every time I've flown, it's been a different type of plane.

208
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:38,749
Rym: Anyway, the three movies I watch.

209
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,810
Scott: I always know what kind of plane I'm on.

210
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,590
Rym: That I would like to Geek Bite for you are No Country for Old Men.

211
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:44,960
Scott: Seen it.

212
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:46,550
Rym: The Last Castle.

213
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,307
Scott: Never even heard of it.

214
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:48,930
Scott: And Phone Booth.

215
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,330
Scott: That sounds something like we would find a video barn.

216
00:10:52,350 --> 00:11:00,810
Rym: So, No Country for Old Men, a ridiculously good movie that I hadn't watched for no goddamn good reason, was a ridiculously good movie.

217
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,730
Scott: I wouldn't say it's ridiculously good.

218
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,850
Scott: I think it's one of those movies where I didn't win a bunch of Oscars and everyone thinks it's the greatest thing ever.

219
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:10,690
Rym: When I say ridiculously good, compare it to the average movie.

220
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:18,650
Scott: It's a really good movie, but it's one of those ones where people act like it's fucking the best movie when it's only a really good movie.

221
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,510
Rym: I put it on the level of Fight Club.

222
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:23,128
Scott: Yeah, it's about the same level as that.

223
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:25,570
Scott: I think this is happening more.

224
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,549
Rym: If you like this movie, you might also like Fight Club, Chinatown, Memento.

225
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:31,369
Scott: About the same.

226
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:31,715
Rym: L.A.

227
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:32,430
Rym: Confidential.

228
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,409
Scott: Memento's another one I think is even more overrated.

229
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:34,793
Rym: I think L.A.

230
00:11:34,813 --> 00:11:37,969
Rym: Confidential might be a little bit better, just because it came out earlier.

231
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,188
Scott: It's very hush-hush.

232
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,989
Rym: I should read that book.

233
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:45,541
Rym: Oh, Seven?

234
00:11:45,561 --> 00:11:46,370
Rym: I guess.

235
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,510
Scott: Yeah, about the same level as that.

236
00:11:48,970 --> 00:12:01,649
Scott: But I think these movies are getting... When someone makes a really good, decent movie on the level of those movies you just mentioned, nowadays, people act like it's the greatest thing ever because there's even more shit now.

237
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:04,050
Scott: There's more shit now, so relatively speaking...

238
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,970
Rym: I'm not going to say there's more shit.

239
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:08,610
Scott: There's not more shit on an absolute scale.

240
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,469
Rym: It's that the percentage of movies are more shit.

241
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:12,778
Rym: Because...

242
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:24,089
Scott: Just go to Google, do this, and type in a year and type in, like, 1994 movies, 1995 movies, and Google, in the search results, will just show you posters across the top and keep increasing the year.

243
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:33,089
Scott: And when you get to about 2001, 2002, 2003, you can see, like, Lord of the Rings, it's, like, up, still good, and then there's, like, a cliff.

244
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,870
Scott: Except for Lord of the Rings, pretty much.

245
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,570
Rym: And there are still good movies every year.

246
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,510
Scott: There's just hardly any.

247
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,170
Scott: You go to, like, the early '90s, and it's just like, wow.

248
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,690
Scott: There are, like, four or five all-time classics in that list.

249
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,213
Scott: Well, like, look at this.

250
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,450
Rym: Look at what other movies came out the same year as Forrest Gump.

251
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,655
Scott: All right, so hold on.

252
00:12:48,655 --> 00:12:49,220
Scott: 1994 movies.

253
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:51,367
Scott: Forrest Gump.

254
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,678
Scott: Pulp Fiction.

255
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:53,630
Scott: Lion King.

256
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,010
Scott: Shawshank Redemption.

257
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:55,950
Scott: All right, all right.

258
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:56,669
Scott: The Professional.

259
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,148
Scott: The Professional.

260
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:57,690
Scott: Already.

261
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,901
Scott: So, one, two, three, four, five.

262
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,175
Scott: True Lies.

263
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,350
Scott: I don't know if you're going to count that.

264
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,772
Rym: True Lies.

265
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,290
Rym: Have you seen True Lies again recently?

266
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:05,950
Scott: I'm just saying.

267
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:08,130
Rym: Because it is a great movie.

268
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,910
Rym: It really is a great movie.

269
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:11,850
Scott: All right, let me continue, right?

270
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,130
Scott: So, Dumb and Dumber, Speed, The Mask.

271
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,550
Scott: Okay, those aren't the greats, but those are still, you know, movies that have lasting power, right?

272
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,044
Rym: I wonder if The Mask holds up.

273
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:21,570
Rym: I'm going to guess.

274
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,069
Scott: The Crow is significant, at least.

275
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:25,330
Scott: Natural Born Killer is important.

276
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:27,870
Rym: Do you think The Crow is significant just because he died?

277
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,870
Rym: Or do you have another reason why you think it's significant?

278
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,870
Scott: No, it's significant not just because he died, but because people make a thing about him dying.

279
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:36,788
Scott: Okay.

280
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,270
Scott: So it's like a historical item.

281
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,170
Rym: I wouldn't count that, though.

282
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,550
Scott: Just the fact that it's existence, right?

283
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,250
Rym: Because it's not like stuff like that happens that often.

284
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,189
Scott: The first Ace Ventura.

285
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:44,683
Scott: Stargate.

286
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,584
Scott: Clerks.

287
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,510
Scott: Okay, so those are all the same year.

288
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,230
Scott: Look how much there was in that year.

289
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,410
Scott: All right, go check out the year 2007, because that's when No Country for Old Men came out.

290
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,918
Scott: All right, so 2007 movies.

291
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,548
Scott: Transformers, nope.

292
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:57,786
Scott: Juno, nope.

293
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,520
Scott: Spider-Man 3, nope.

294
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:02,809
Scott: No Country for Old Men, Ratatouille.

295
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:04,006
Rym: All right, two greats.

296
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:04,460
Scott: Two.

297
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:07,490
Scott: I Am Legend, super bad.

298
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,010
Scott: There Will Be Blood.

299
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,270
Scott: Knocked Up, Bourne Ultimatum.

300
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:12,070
Scott: Hot Fuzz.

301
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:12,701
Scott: Yeah.

302
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:13,729
Scott: Okay, not bad.

303
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:17,610
Scott: You know, one of the Harry Potters.

304
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,882
Rym: Super bad was kind of shit.

305
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,629
Rym: I'm sorry, guys.

306
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,670
Scott: I'm saying it was shit.

307
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,099
Scott: Yeah, I don't like, you know, it's like.

308
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,348
Scott: everything here is just like, um.

309
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:25,650
Scott: Yeah, so we've got, what, three?

310
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:26,064
Scott: Two?

311
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,588
Scott: Two or three, right?

312
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,710
Scott: We went from how many?

313
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,530
Scott: Like, seven to two or three.

314
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,970
Scott: And if you look, it's like, all right, we'll go to 2006.

315
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,222
Scott: Here we go.

316
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:35,350
Scott: The Departed.

317
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,162
Scott: There we go.

318
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:36,930
Scott: All right.

319
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,149
Scott: Prestige, slightly overrated, but still good.

320
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:39,461
Scott: Yeah.

321
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:40,250
Scott: Casino Royale.

322
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:42,130
Rym: I will never blame a movie for being overrated.

323
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,410
Rym: I will not rate a movie based on how other people are overrating it.

324
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:51,850
Scott: No, I'm just saying it's not as good as, like, a lot of people out there think, you know, if I say Prestige, some people out there might be thinking, great movie.

325
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:52,646
Scott: Oh my god, so good.

326
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:53,610
Scott: I'm like, oh, good.

327
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,607
Rym: If you haven't seen a lot of movies, it is.

328
00:14:56,017 --> 00:14:56,247
Scott: Sure.

329
00:14:57,371 --> 00:15:02,110
Scott: Um, X-Men Last Stand, Superman Return, right?

330
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,708
Scott: So again, two, two movies in this year.

331
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,250
Scott: Pan's Labyrinth.

332
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:06,807
Scott: Okay, three.

333
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,509
Rym: Pan's Labyrinth was super good.

334
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:09,225
Scott: Pretty good.

335
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,213
Rym: Um.

336
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,329
Rym: Kind of brutal.

337
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:23,229
Rym: You know, so No Country for Old Men is a good movie for the acting and for the deconstruction, and it's a Coen brothers movie, which I kind of like all of them.

338
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:25,770
Rym: And they're all kind of the same.

339
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:31,809
Rym: Not that they're the same plot, but that they have the same kind of attention to atmosphere that I like in movies.

340
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:45,470
Rym: But of all the people who played characters in this movie, the reason I like this movie a lot is not, I'm not going to spoil anything, the bad guy is one of my favorite quote bad guys in movies in a long time.

341
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,227
Scott: Real good bad guy.

342
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:55,269
Rym: Because he's a fucking psychopath and he's crazy, but he's not crazy in the way that people who are crazy in movies usually are.

343
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,649
Scott: Yeah, he's not like Joker crazy.

344
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,225
Rym: Yup.

345
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,190
Scott: He's not like, you know, uh, who else is crazy?

346
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,110
Rym: And all the other characters know he's crazy and act like he's crazy.

347
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:04,546
Scott: Yup.

348
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:08,190
Rym: And the way that he's crazy is just really fun.

349
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:10,590
Rym: I don't know, I like that movie a lot.

350
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:19,669
Rym: Also, Woody Harrelson plays a really good role and his resolution was great because I didn't see that coming at all, but it's a good movie.

351
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,470
Rym: So, uh, there was a movie called The Last Castle in 2001.

352
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,010
Scott: I like castles.

353
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,509
Rym: And Robert Redford stars in it.

354
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:29,189
Scott: All right.

355
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,750
Rym: And all I could think when I saw that was Robert Redford is alive.

356
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:33,468
Scott: Sure.

357
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,330
Rym: Robert Redford was in a movie, in a movie that's relatively recent, like within the last two decades.

358
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:39,830
Rym: Okay.

359
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,407
Rym: So yeah, this movie, I just didn't know what to expect, but I read the description and this sounded pretty good.

360
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,514
Rym: A court-martialed U.S.

361
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:51,262
Scott: general rallies together the inmates in his prison in an uprising.

362
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:58,089
Scott: So it's a military prison.

363
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:58,845
Rym: Yes.

364
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,350
Rym: So what I expected was famous court-martialed general uprising.

365
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,270
Rym: I thought this was going to be some awesome shit going down.

366
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,508
Scott: You court-martialed the wrong guy.

367
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:08,190
Rym: And he's guilty.

368
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:10,190
Rym: Apparently, like he disobeyed orders or whatever.

369
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,089
Scott: His leadership skills helped him, you know, free all the guys in the prison.

370
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:21,049
Rym: So the movie starts with him being taken to prison and the commandant of the prison is like, they shouldn't be putting him in prison.

371
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,648
Rym: They should be giving him a goddamn medal.

372
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:25,089
Rym: So I thought there's going to be some crazy political drama.

373
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,728
Rym: You know what this movie is?

374
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:34,990
Rym: It is Cool Hand Luke plus Dead Poet Society crossed with The Shawshank Redemption.

375
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:35,488
Scott: Okay.

376
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:39,770
Rym: It is those three movies mashed together and it is fucking awful.

377
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,909
Rym: It is the main character.

378
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,830
Rym: The bad guy is basically George Costanza and Robert Redford.

379
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,789
Scott: Is that the warden?

380
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,429
Rym: Yes.

381
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,087
Rym: The commandant.

382
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:58,650
Rym: He's the warden is Cool Hand Luke straight up, except he's also Robin Williams in the Dead Poet Society.

383
00:17:59,176 --> 00:17:59,729
Rym: This movie.

384
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,630
Rym: Good fucking God.

385
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:02,509
Scott: Okay.

386
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:03,567
Rym: So false.

387
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,550
Scott: So what's the third movie?

388
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,805
Rym: So the third movie is phone booth from 2002 is about Superman.

389
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:17,408
Rym: So, uh, the beginning of this movie was weird because it makes a big deal about, Oh my God, cell phones.

390
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:18,788
Rym: Oh my God.

391
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,416
Rym: But then you think back to 2002.

392
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:21,709
Rym: Yeah.

393
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,270
Rym: Yeah.

394
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,289
Rym: Like cell phones were not that much of a thing yet.

395
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:27,749
Scott: In 2002 only certain people had them.

396
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:31,157
Rym: So I remember when this movie came out, I remember thinking it was dumb and I ignored it.

397
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,266
Rym: The plot of this movie.

398
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:33,950
Rym: Oh, it was written by Larry Cohen.

399
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,505
Rym: I didn't know that.

400
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:45,249
Rym: Anyway, the plot of this movie is that some douchebag goes to the last phone booth in Manhattan, which was a real phone booth and makes a call.

401
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,830
Rym: And then as he, after he hangs it up, the phone rings and he picks it up and the guy's like, I have a rifle trained on you.

402
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,328
Rym: If you hang up, I'll fucking kill you.

403
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:55,729
Rym: And then he shoots something nearby to prove that he could do it.

404
00:18:56,271 --> 00:19:02,270
Rym: And then the movies, one of those dramas that plays out in real speed, which I just mentioned earlier, except it plays out in real time.

405
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,898
Rym: More like what was the name of that movie?

406
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:12,590
Rym: where the guy has to assassinate this like Senator in this mall or else they'll kill his daughter.

407
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:14,430
Rym: And that movie was filmed in real time.

408
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:16,770
Rym: Like it doesn't skip forward or fall back.

409
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,430
Rym: And it just follows time like second for second, the whole thing.

410
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,570
Scott: I don't know when you said a guy has to assassinate.

411
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,410
Scott: I might, my brain was just like, uh, what's it called?

412
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:32,490
Rym: Um, so I didn't remember the name of a movie and you don't even remember the name of the movie that you're referencing from the name of the movie that I remember.

413
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:38,590
Scott: The one where they, they like mess with the guy's memory and they brainwash him and it's got the crazy Chinese conspiracy.

414
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,850
Rym: Oh, the Manchurian candidate.

415
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,910
Scott: That's when you said they forced the guy to assassinate someone.

416
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,685
Scott: That's what I thought of.

417
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:45,484
Scott: Or the remake called the Manchurian candidate.

418
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:58,549
Scott: If someone says Manchurian candidate, I've seen both of them, but my brain just always thinks of the old one with the scene where, you know, the Chinese crazy, you know, room, whatever with those guys.

419
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:01,150
Rym: The movie with the Chinese crazy room.

420
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:10,529
Rym: So the movie follows that drama and I got to say it was better than I expected and I didn't know Kiefer Sutherland was in it.

421
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,346
Scott: I don't know who that is.

422
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,690
Rym: Uh, he did the voice acting in Armitage, the third poly matrix.

423
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:18,026
Scott: I don't remember that voice.

424
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,246
Rym: The second worst dub ever.

425
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,348
Scott: Pretty bad dub though.

426
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:23,090
Rym: Ever.

427
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,290
Rym: It has that scene where Armitage is like getting like taken away or shot or whatever and he just goes, no.

428
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:29,638
Scott: That's just one of those animes.

429
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,530
Scott: that's all action and art and there's no story.

430
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,910
Scott: It's just, all right, we have some robot girl and she runs around shooting stuff at the end.

431
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,221
Rym: Yup.

432
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:36,768
Rym: But it's so deep.

433
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:37,829
Scott: No, it's not.

434
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,349
Scott: You just run around shooting stuff at the end.

435
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,630
Rym: This movie was better than I thought and here's why.

436
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:46,050
Rym: The movie is so fucking stupid.

437
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:54,210
Rym: The main character is such a douchebag and such a stereotypical Hollywood douchebag.

438
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,409
Scott: Maybe you just hope he gets shot.

439
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:02,250
Rym: But then there's this scene where he's in the phone booth and he can't hang up or the guy will shoot him and this hooker comes over.

440
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:19,108
Rym: Cause this is back when, you know, the end of the era of hookers, it like just out in the daylight in New York city and she bangs on the phone booth like I want to make a call and she sounds like a Ruby rod and he's like, no, I can't hang up the phone.

441
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:24,450
Rym: and he closes the door on her and he bumps into her hand and she's like, Oh, you hurt my dick hand.

442
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:25,469
Rym: You didn't.

443
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,389
Rym: Oh no, you didn't.

444
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,489
Rym: You just hurt my dick hand.

445
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:30,209
Rym: And this dick hand thing just keeps coming back.

446
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:39,930
Rym: And it is telling that as dumb as this movie was, I had to know how it ended after having watched just a little bit.

447
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,430
Scott: He had to know.

448
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,230
Scott: He had to see the dick hand.

449
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,769
Rym: I had to know what happened to the dick hand.

450
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,290
Rym: And I watched to the end and I was not disappointed.

451
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:48,630
Scott: You got dick hand?

452
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:51,490
Rym: And it's funny cause I explained the plot to Emily in more detail.

453
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,749
Rym: She was like the same as you.

454
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:53,968
Rym: Why did you watch this movie?

455
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,189
Rym: And I was like, all right, so here's the plot.

456
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:57,310
Rym: And then she's like, all right, whatever.

457
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:01,190
Rym: And then later in the night she's like, so does he get away?

458
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:04,327
Rym: And I was like, Oh, maybe you should watch the movie and find out.

459
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,469
Scott: If someone did that shit to me, I'd be like, okay bro, just, just don't do anything.

460
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:12,470
Scott: I proved to me that you can shoot some does.

461
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:13,310
Scott: And that's right.

462
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:17,250
Scott: And then as soon as I say that, it'd be like, okay, I hang up and I run into an alley.

463
00:22:17,932 --> 00:22:20,570
Rym: Uh, so he had a, he might've had a semi-automatic rifle.

464
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:21,842
Scott: Oh no, no.

465
00:22:22,411 --> 00:22:22,857
Scott: You hear it.

466
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,670
Scott: You hear it later.

467
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,650
Rym: It is definitely a bolt action rifle.

468
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,849
Scott: But can he re-aim it at me so quickly?

469
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:29,790
Rym: Probably.

470
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,186
Scott: Even like he's aiming at some light bulb or something.

471
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,749
Rym: So here's part of the part of why the movie was actually kind of fun.

472
00:22:35,151 --> 00:22:39,890
Rym: So he's in the phone booth and he's scared cause the guy already proved he's super accurate.

473
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,710
Rym: And then this pimp comes out and he is really funny.

474
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,229
Rym: And eventually the pimp's like, hang up the phone.

475
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,629
Rym: I'm going to fucking beat the shit out of you.

476
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,850
Rym: So then the pimp comes back with a baseball bat and just basically going to kill the guy.

477
00:22:52,131 --> 00:22:55,269
Rym: And then the guy on the phone is like, I can make this stop.

478
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:57,469
Rym: And he's like, fine.

479
00:22:57,831 --> 00:23:01,750
Rym: And then the sniper shoots the pimp and then all the police come now.

480
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:07,050
Rym: And the guy in the phone booth is surrounded and everyone thinks he shot the pimp and he has a gun.

481
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,790
Rym: And the guy on the phone's like, if you do anything now, the cops will shoot you.

482
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,667
Rym: I don't have to do anything.

483
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:17,130
Scott: And the movie for a shitty movie, a little bit of attack on a gas station there.

484
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:20,150
Rym: The movie was better than I thought.

485
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,970
Rym: And the reason I bring this movie up is that even Emily was like, so how's it end?

486
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:26,489
Rym: Like how's he get away?

487
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,110
Rym: It was better than The Last Castle.

488
00:23:29,836 --> 00:23:30,430
Scott: I'm sure it was.

489
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:38,250
Rym: The moral of all of this, you all need to watch the Dead Poets Society, Shawshank Redemption, and Cool Hand Luke.

490
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,510
Scott: But not The Last Castle.

491
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,709
Rym: Not The Last Castle.

492
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:45,650
Rym: In fact, pretend that all those movies were the same movie and that is The Last Castle.

493
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:48,147
Rym: Also Robert Redford keeps taking his shirt off.

494
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,523
Scott: How old is he?

495
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:51,281
Rym: Like a hundred?

496
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:51,787
Rym: I don't know.

497
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:56,010
Rym: So you got anything?

498
00:23:56,932 --> 00:23:57,762
Rym: On Thursday?

499
00:23:57,782 --> 00:23:58,430
Scott: The lounge?

500
00:23:59,310 --> 00:23:59,766
Scott: The lounge?

501
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,689
Scott: Yeah, I was in the lounge with your mom.

502
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:03,393
Scott: I don't know.

503
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:08,830
Scott: Everything that I have is anime, video game, or technology related.

504
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,010
Scott: There's pretty much nothing going on that is not related to one of those things.

505
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:17,370
Scott: And you already spent a whole bunch of time talking about three whole movies.

506
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,742
Scott: So why waste any of those things?

507
00:24:19,782 --> 00:24:20,528
Scott: We can just move on.

508
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,980
Rym: So moving on to things of the day.

509
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,200
Rym: Wanted to see if I could clip the new mixer and I did not.

510
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,483
Scott: Okay, so check this out.

511
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:37,800
Scott: This is a video from 2011 showing some research done at Stanford.

512
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:39,600
Scott: So it's two years old, a little late to the party.

513
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,560
Scott: But what it is is it's dual photography.

514
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,780
Scott: So the way this works is they have a camera and they have a projector, right?

515
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,140
Scott: Like the kind you would use to project a movie onto your wall.

516
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:57,780
Scott: And they aim the camera and the projector at the same scene from two different angles, right?

517
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,280
Scott: Then they basically take a picture with the camera of the scene, right?

518
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:15,620
Scott: And they are able to, with math, take a pic with the data from the camera, show you what the projector sees.

519
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:23,310
Scott: So the picture that develops after processing is this is what the projector is seeing, right?

520
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:29,040
Scott: And it can go so far in the demonstration as to they have a playing card.

521
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:32,819
Scott: And you look at the photograph that the camera took.

522
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:35,680
Scott: And the photograph is the back of the playing card.

523
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,600
Scott: But the projector, of course, is at a different angle and it can see the face of the card.

524
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:49,260
Scott: And, of course, with the data that comes out of the camera, plus their processing, you can see the face of the card super clearly.

525
00:25:49,641 --> 00:25:53,760
Scott: Based on the light that reflected off the card and bounced off and back into the camera.

526
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:57,508
Rym: I've talked about stuff like that for a long time.

527
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:00,219
Rym: Having a functional example is amazing.

528
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,478
Scott: And they had this two years ago.

529
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:02,059
Scott: Yeah.

530
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:04,098
Scott: So imagine if...

531
00:26:04,382 --> 00:26:05,420
Rym: That's in Google Glass.

532
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,067
Scott: Well, it doesn't have to be Google Glass.

533
00:26:07,088 --> 00:26:07,912
Scott: Just like any camera.

534
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:09,320
Scott: You take a picture of something with your camera.

535
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:14,574
Scott: And then you just like go into Lightroom or Photoshop and you're like, "Okay, here's the scene.

536
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:15,858
Scott: There's a thing...".

537
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,380
Rym: What's around that corner?

538
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,820
Scott: Yeah, there's like a light bulb over there and the light bulb is at this position.

539
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,700
Scott: Show me what it looks like from the light bulb looking that way.

540
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:34,240
Rym: I'm convinced that cameras as we know them will someday disappear and will be replaced by a button that you carry around on you or you activate it.

541
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,001
Rym: You go,

542
00:26:35,282 --> 00:26:35,704
Rym: "Bam!"

543
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:39,619
Rym: And it just takes a sort of metadata moment of...

544
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,800
Scott: It just captures a bunch of photons from all over.

545
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,964
Rym: No, it doesn't even do that.

546
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:47,300
Rym: It just captures the exact timestamp and GPS location of you.

547
00:26:48,221 --> 00:26:55,240
Rym: And then embedded sensors from everything else in the world combined all dump their data into a blob associated with that.

548
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,679
Rym: And then you can explore that blob at your leisure later.

549
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:58,177
Scott: I'm sure.

550
00:26:59,061 --> 00:26:59,908
Rym: That's all gonna come.

551
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:01,340
Rym: That's culture shit that's coming down the road.

552
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,351
Scott: But I can't wait for this shit to... Like if someone could use this in sports, right?

553
00:27:04,371 --> 00:27:06,600
Scott: You could have a lot less cameras at the sporting event.

554
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:10,220
Scott: But still get the angle to see what happens.

555
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:10,802
Rym: Wait, wait.

556
00:27:10,843 --> 00:27:11,065
Rym: Yeah.

557
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:11,610
Rym: Yeah.

558
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:12,720
Rym: Take that soccer.

559
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:13,436
Scott: Yeah.

560
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:15,118
Rym: Soccer will never use this.

561
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:17,380
Scott: Soccer isn't even using regular cameras.

562
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,203
Rym: I know.

563
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:18,840
Rym: Speed walking.

564
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,077
Scott: But football might use this.

565
00:27:22,661 --> 00:27:27,860
Rym: I look forward to the day when they zoom into the hockey player's brain to figure out if he started the fight or the other guy did.

566
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,076
Rym: So Scott apparently had no idea that this "What does the fox

567
00:27:34,116 --> 00:27:34,377
Rym: say?"

568
00:27:34,437 --> 00:27:35,220
Rym: meme happened.

569
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,259
Scott: Oh yeah, I didn't see that at all.

570
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,131
Rym: Yeah, that was all over the internet.

571
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:39,360
Rym: 81 million views already.

572
00:27:39,982 --> 00:27:40,138
Scott: Okay.

573
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:41,443
Rym: So, yeah.

574
00:27:41,523 --> 00:27:42,264
Rym: What does the fox say?

575
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:48,417
Rym: If you didn't see this, culturally in the US at least, and a lot of other countries, you know, what does the dog say?

576
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:48,718
Rym: Woof.

577
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:49,579
Rym: What does the cat say?

578
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:49,920
Rym: Meow.

579
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,020
Scott: Well, in different countries it says different things.

580
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,244
Rym: Yeah, but everyone has a thing for that.

581
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,876
Rym: But culturally, if you ask the average American, "What does the fox

582
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:56,157
Rym: say?"

583
00:27:56,177 --> 00:27:56,920
Rym: They blank.

584
00:27:57,725 --> 00:27:59,260
Scott: It's like a dog, but it sort of yaps.

585
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,386
Rym: Yeah, smart people know foxes make noises.

586
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:07,340
Rym: But if you ask an average person, if you go to a speak and say, there's no goddamn fox on that thing.

587
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:11,820
Scott: Dude, let's make a speak and say that only has animals that are normally not on a speak and say.

588
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,000
Scott: That would be a pretty good speak and say.

589
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,535
Scott: That would just be like, we'll make it like an Arduino and we'll just sort of, you know, we'll print out a sticker for it.

590
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:18,860
Scott: We'll just take a speak and say and mod it.

591
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:21,450
Scott: And that'll be like a special speak and say.

592
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,559
Scott: You just plant it somewhere or bring it to the Maker Faire.

593
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,425
Rym: That would be a cool thing to do.

594
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:28,294
Rym: That's actually the first time I've had a project with an Arduino.

595
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:28,936
Rym: That'd be fun.

596
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,300
Rym: That I could just do anyway.

597
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,639
Scott: We need to come up with all the animals though.

598
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:37,031
Rym: Someone said in some country in Eastern Europe, I think, they were on Fark.

599
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:37,652
Rym: They were like, "Yip,

600
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:37,932
Rym: yap."

601
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:39,035
Rym: And they linked.

602
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:39,395
Rym: I forget.

603
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,458
Rym: I can't even find it again.

604
00:28:40,498 --> 00:28:41,279
Rym: But there's this little...

605
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:42,220
Scott: A children's book?

606
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,449
Rym: A children's comic book, cartoon, whatever.

607
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,515
Rym: And the fox says, "Yip,

608
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:47,876
Rym: yap.".

609
00:28:47,997 --> 00:28:49,140
Rym: That's just what foxes say.

610
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,960
Scott: Yeah, that's about right.

611
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:51,082
Rym: Yeah.

612
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:52,846
Rym: But yeah, this video just kind of makes fun of that.

613
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:54,048
Rym: It's very, very well done.

614
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,993
Rym: But that's not my thing of the day.

615
00:28:56,073 --> 00:28:57,637
Rym: I'm just pointing out that Scott didn't know what it was.

616
00:28:57,677 --> 00:28:58,960
Rym: So many of you might not either.

617
00:28:59,564 --> 00:29:01,499
Rym: My thing of the day is someone else.

618
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,156
Scott: Okay.

619
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:07,535
Rym: Who made the origin story of What Does the Fox Say?

620
00:29:07,555 --> 00:29:08,980
Rym: And this is so good.

621
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,267
Scott: Okay.

622
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:11,229
Rym: That's it.

623
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:11,718
Rym: That's what I got.

624
00:29:13,345 --> 00:29:13,779
Rym: Metamoment?

625
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,101
Scott: Metamoment indeed.

626
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,424
Scott: Wow, there's a lot of meta going on.

627
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,106
Scott: Let's check the calendar.

628
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:23,435
Scott: My calendar is pretty empty except for Thanksgiving.

629
00:29:24,136 --> 00:29:26,520
Scott: Thanksgiving in November is coming.

630
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:32,340
Scott: It's going to be probably the only time for the next many millennia that Thanksgiving and Hanukkah overlap.

631
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,120
Rym: Want to do something special?

632
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,068
Scott: You got to have freaking so much combo that can happen.

633
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:44,678
Scott: Potato latkes with cranberry applesauce is only the beginning of the miracle of Thanksgiving.

634
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,668
Rym: We always go home to our families for Thanksgiving.

635
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,520
Rym: You want to throw a big feast of Thanksgiving in the city?

636
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,584
Scott: I'm just saying we need a thanksgivica something.

637
00:29:52,744 --> 00:30:01,340
Scott: Anyway, also this Saturday, no, this Saturday is netrunner tournament in Albany at the zombie store that I'm go to.

638
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:08,853
Scott: But there's going to be one in Sunday, 1230 at the 20 sided store in Brooklyn, which I will go to.

639
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:13,180
Scott: But the Albany one is the special magical fantasy flight official one.

640
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:22,060
Scott: The fantasy flight official ones in New York are on the 19th and the 20th, which is going to be the 19th is at the strat and the 20th is in Brooklyn somewhere.

641
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:30,520
Scott: But that is also the weekend of Burning Con 2013, the penteclagon, which I think you can still register for.

642
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:33,750
Rym: I guess the schedule is being made.

643
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:36,640
Rym: Like the deadline for submitting my shit was long past.

644
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,286
Scott: Next weekend is New York Comic Con and we're not going to.

645
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:44,760
Scott: This weekend is big bad con in California somewhere, which is an indie RPG con.

646
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,180
Rym: I got to finish my new scenario.

647
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:53,180
Scott: But the only con that really matters is next year, the beginning of next year, which is magfest.

648
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:54,999
Rym: It's coming.

649
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,387
Scott: That's the only thing to be excited for right now.

650
00:30:57,447 --> 00:31:00,880
Scott: Everything else is sort of like hibernate for the winter and play games, guys.

651
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:02,524
Rym: We are resuming production of.

652
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:03,847
Rym: GeekNights presents utenna.

653
00:31:03,907 --> 00:31:04,688
Rym: Have no fear.

654
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,272
Rym: We have a new mixer.

655
00:31:07,014 --> 00:31:09,880
Rym: We have videos on the internet.

656
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,423
Rym: We're streaming stuff.

657
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:17,760
Rym: There's a tumbler that every day is tumbling an old episode of GeekNights, an artisanal tumble.

658
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:24,960
Rym: The book club book is Stazzyland, a book about what will happen in the US if we let the NSA go away with all this shit.

659
00:31:25,261 --> 00:31:26,060
Scott: Right now they're shut down.

660
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:26,542
Scott: Yeah.

661
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:27,025
Rym: Nope.

662
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:27,990
Rym: The NSA is not shut down.

663
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:29,960
Rym: In fact, you want to know some bullshit?

664
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,781
Rym: You know what?

665
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:37,120
Rym: One thing that is shut down, the part of the IRS that helps you defend yourself if you mess up on taxes.

666
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:37,583
Rym: OK.

667
00:31:37,704 --> 00:31:38,812
Rym: You know what's not shut down?

668
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:40,040
Scott: The part of the IRS that collects taxes.

669
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,319
Rym: That takes your shit away if you mess up.

670
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,540
Rym: So basically the due process part is shut down, but the take your shit part is still running.

671
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,680
Scott: How is that not an essential service?

672
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,440
Scott: They realize the head of the IRS decided that, right?

673
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,764
Scott: That's what they've been telling us.

674
00:31:56,824 --> 00:32:02,100
Scott: is that the people who decide what's essential and what's not essential are like the heads of the departments, like the upper management.

675
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:08,580
Scott: So that means the head of the IRS just decided that they have complete power to just make that decision.

676
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:13,519
Scott: And they decided that, which means whoever is the head of the IRS right now, let's look them up.

677
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:16,078
Scott: That's not head of IRC.

678
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:17,733
Scott: Who is the head of the IRS?

679
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:24,314
Scott: Commissioner of Internal Revenue is.

680
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:30,780
Scott: That's from 1862.

681
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,591
Scott: Currently, Daniel Werfel.

682
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,060
Scott: He is the acting head of Internal Revenue.

683
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,465
Scott: Daniel Werfel, you're a jerk.

684
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:40,250
Scott: You're a bad person.

685
00:32:40,531 --> 00:32:43,780
Scott: Legitimately, you're just a bad guy, but you're appointed.

686
00:32:44,143 --> 00:32:44,990
Scott: So we can't vote you out.

687
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:46,080
Scott: You're just an appointed person.

688
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,079
Rym: So yeah, the government shut down.

689
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:51,518
Scott: You did.

690
00:32:52,683 --> 00:32:54,420
Rym: I'm kind of amazed that it actually happened.

691
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,980
Scott: Start menu, but when you go to the start menu, you actually are stopping.

692
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,883
Rym: Did you see that tweet?

693
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:03,620
Rym: Someone was like, it appears your government has shut down improperly.

694
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,900
Scott: You realize there are like four tweets that keep going around and everyone just keeps retweeting them.

695
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,820
Scott: I saw them like three days in a row, the same tweets over and over again.

696
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,740
Rym: Because they're just going to make the same jokes about this stuff.

697
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,140
Rym: The thing is, many of the people who are tweeting.

698
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,460
Scott: I wish there was a way to like tell Twitter like high duplicate retweets.

699
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,820
Scott: Like if I've seen that tweet from someone else and someone tweets it again, I don't see it again.

700
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,740
Rym: It depends sometimes because years ago I tweeted something and it just like really went viral.

701
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:36,880
Rym: And I remember that it kept getting retweeted, but then it kept getting retweeted back at me via old clients with the RT and things in front of it.

702
00:33:37,361 --> 00:33:42,840
Rym: So I kept getting my own tweet retweeted back at me by people that I follow like months after the fact.

703
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,240
Scott: Yeah, I don't like that.

704
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:52,200
Rym: But I think a lot of the people who listen to GeekNights were not really old enough to remember the last time that this happened.

705
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,478
Rym: Like back when we were in high school.

706
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,120
Rym: Because that happened when we were in high school.

707
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,460
Rym: It was shut down for like a month right around the same time of year.

708
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,656
Scott: Also, many states have had shutdowns.

709
00:34:02,381 --> 00:34:06,960
Rym: I grew up in the state of Michigan where government shutdowns were plentiful.

710
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:13,080
Scott: There have also been a lot of town shutdowns I've known about because the town, it was usually involving the school budget.

711
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:18,719
Scott: There would be like an argument where between people who, usually old people who wanted to not have a school tax.

712
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:26,460
Scott: And you know, and then the people who had families or were in school and were like we need a school tax so we want to make the school budget more.

713
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:28,879
Scott: And they couldn't decide and the town would shut down.

714
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:33,940
Rym: So to talk about this a little bit, in case you guys really don't understand what happened.

715
00:34:34,302 --> 00:34:36,980
Rym: Because I went back when Obama got elected.

716
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,080
Scott: I know there's a lot of countries and other places where this cannot happen.

717
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,980
Rym: Oh my god, like Australia, if this happens, everyone just gets fucked in these new elections.

718
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:46,800
Scott: Right, there are other places where it can't happen.

719
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,639
Scott: So for people to understand why it happens here, we need to explain to you.

720
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,920
Rym: Well I was just in Istanbul, right?

721
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,600
Rym: And the people I talked to, because I have a lot of friends there.

722
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:58,313
Rym: They were like, so what's this about your government shutting down?

723
00:34:58,353 --> 00:35:00,200
Rym: Like how the fuck can that happen?

724
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:06,380
Rym: And the funny part is that when I explained it, a lot of people outside of the US.

725
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,640
Scott: Don't know how the US works.

726
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:13,840
Rym: No, they think that the Republican party is like some wacko right wing fringe and isn't a mainstream party.

727
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,400
Scott: It is Iraqi mainstream, it's a mainstream wacko fringe.

728
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,579
Rym: It's a mainstream party, they don't realize that.

729
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,710
Rym: They're like, what do you mean?

730
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,479
Rym: they're half the country?

731
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,079
Scott: Their country didn't have a south.

732
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,740
Scott: Like Germany had a south, it's called East Germany.

733
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,880
Rym: Well you saw Greece just arrested the leaders of their far right party.

734
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,500
Scott: And they were only able to do that because the guys friggin murdered somebody.

735
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,239
Scott: Right, because I guess they have mostly freedom of speech in Greece, right?

736
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:39,351
Rym: Yeah, kinda.

737
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:42,299
Scott: I mean they couldn't just arrest them for being Nazis that they are.

738
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,700
Rym: And I'm fine with those not being allowed to arrest Nazis.

739
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:55,000
Scott: The thing is, while I'm 100% anti-Golden Dawn nut jobs, if they arrested them simply for being Nazis, I would be not okay with that.

740
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:02,720
Scott: But those guys have done plenty of other things besides simply say antisemitic things and express their evil speech.

741
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:06,616
Scott: So it's perfectly okay to arrest them, which they finally did.

742
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:07,500
Scott: It took too long.

743
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:14,440
Scott: You realize those Golden Dawn crazies, like in the US, there are plenty of places where you can vote for the Nazis, right?

744
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:18,390
Scott: In Greece, those Golden Dawn guys have like 18 seats.

745
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,560
Scott: That's how racist Greece is.

746
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,759
Rym: Far right country.

747
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,719
Rym: Dude, in Sweden, the Nazi extremists are a significant political force.

748
00:36:29,362 --> 00:36:32,820
Rym: Yeah, free speech is the best thing ever, but I digress.

749
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,840
Rym: So I'm gonna explain what's happening to you by quoting Abraham Lincoln.

750
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,408
Scott: Ram, you gotta stop doing the tweets.

751
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:43,120
Scott: If you can't fit it in one tweet, you shouldn't be tweeting it.

752
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,820
Rym: Do you know how many people retweeted that stream of tweets?

753
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,728
Scott: Except for every single person that says,

754
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:48,471
Scott: "Rims."

755
00:36:48,531 --> 00:36:50,460
Scott: And you realize, I have more followers than you.

756
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:51,880
Rym: I'm gaining on you.

757
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:54,466
Scott: I just want to point out this thing.

758
00:36:54,486 --> 00:36:56,051
Scott: I don't care how many followers I have.

759
00:36:56,211 --> 00:36:58,980
Scott: It's just relevant to the other point I'm making.

760
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,760
Scott: The number doesn't... I don't have an ego or whatever, right?

761
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,404
Scott: So I have like 100 more than you.

762
00:37:04,226 --> 00:37:08,720
Scott: You have almost twice the number of tweets that I have and you've been tweeting for less time.

763
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,900
Rym: Yeah, I tweet a lot because I poop a lot.

764
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,027
Scott: I tweet too much.

765
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:13,860
Scott: Too much tweeting.

766
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,160
Rym: The thing is, most of those tweets are just me having conversations with people.

767
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,359
Scott: I'm just saying, too many tweets.

768
00:37:19,652 --> 00:37:20,219
Rym: Not enough tweets.

769
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,540
Scott: Twitter is all about less... The reason it's small is so that you shut the fuck up.

770
00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:25,118
Rym: Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

771
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,040
Rym: How many tweets does Daryl Surratt have?

772
00:37:28,723 --> 00:37:29,959
Scott: Probably more than either of us.

773
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,643
Rym: Alright, Daryl.

774
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:33,714
Rym: Let's see, Daryl Surratt.

775
00:37:34,156 --> 00:37:34,940
Rym: You follow each other.

776
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,025
Rym: 40,000 tweets, 3,000 followers.

777
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,304
Scott: You have like 12,000 and I have less than 10,000.

778
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:44,740
Rym: I've noticed something because I was keeping track of it with the graph.

779
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,894
Rym: The more I tweet, the more followers I get.

780
00:37:46,995 --> 00:37:47,337
Rym: Straight up.

781
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,219
Scott: Besides you just have an auto-tweet tweet constantly?

782
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,440
Scott: Bother everyone who follows me, the stream is flooded and they unfollow me.

783
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,260
Rym: The thing is, you do want to do it like Conrad has his regular Twitter and then all my developer shit is in his other Twitter.

784
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:03,140
Scott: Anyway.

785
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:08,920
Rym: Anyway, I'm going to quote Abraham Lincoln in a letter he wrote in 1861.

786
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,010
Scott: Republican Abraham Lincoln.

787
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:11,020
Scott: Noted Republican.

788
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,000
Rym: So one thing to keep clear, guys, outside of the US.

789
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,999
Rym: The Democratic Party today is effectively the Republican Party from the 1860s.

790
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,214
Scott: The Whigs.

791
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:20,921
Rym: Yes.

792
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:25,256
Rym: The Republican Party today is basically the Democratic Party from the 1860s.

793
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:26,760
Scott: That's right.

794
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:33,498
Rym: The quote is as such, and as a side note, people could write fucking speeches and letters back in the 1860s.

795
00:38:35,345 --> 00:38:37,379
Rym: This is just a letter Abraham Lincoln wrote to a guy.

796
00:38:38,923 --> 00:38:40,380
Rym: What is our present condition?

797
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,800
Rym: We have just carried an election on principles fairly stated to the people.

798
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:54,820
Rym: Now we are told in advance that government shall be broken up unless we surrender to those we have beaten before we take the offices.

799
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,437
Scott: Right.

800
00:38:55,922 --> 00:39:00,740
Rym: In this, they are either attempting to play upon us, or they are in dead earnest.

801
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,960
Rym: Either way, if we surrender, is the end of us and of the government.

802
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,077
Rym: They will repeat the experiment upon us, ad libitum.

803
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:08,982
Scott: Right.

804
00:39:09,044 --> 00:39:10,000
Scott: So here's the issue, right?

805
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,760
Scott: So you have a system in place, which we do, that is kind of a crappy system.

806
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,400
Scott: It has problems.

807
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,580
Rym: Notice our system is not the system we gave to Iraq and Afghanistan after we invaded them.

808
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:20,300
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

809
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,160
Rym: We gave them a parliamentary system instead.

810
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:23,968
Scott: Yeah, so, in the

811
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:24,611
Scott: U.S.,

812
00:39:25,093 --> 00:39:26,740
Scott: you have a majority rule, right?

813
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,579
Scott: So you need a majority to rule, of course.

814
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:34,180
Scott: But, if you have, say, the numbers not working out, right?

815
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,477
Scott: We have, you know, the two, right?

816
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,600
Scott: So right now, the House, you've got Republicans sort of, right, in charge.

817
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:49,489
Rym: Well, the Republican Party controls the House of Representatives because they took over, many years ago, the state legislatures ahead of the U.S.

818
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:50,673
Rym: 2010 census.

819
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:53,100
Rym: that determines where district boundaries are drawn.

820
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:05,000
Rym: So they gerrymandered, or gerrymandered, if you're a pedant, like me, the districts to ensure that they would control the House and hold on to that one piece of the government they can still control.

821
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:08,700
Rym: Right, and the Senate- Even though they lost the popular election.

822
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,560
Scott: Right, so most of the people in the country voted Democrat.

823
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,111
Scott: Most of the Senate is Democrats.

824
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:14,320
Scott: The President is Democrat.

825
00:40:14,742 --> 00:40:18,540
Scott: Most of the states, right, where those Democrats live, have Democrat people.

826
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,140
Scott: But, the Republicans won certain things, so they control this one part of the government, right?

827
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,100
Rym: One half of one third of the federal government.

828
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,299
Scott: So it's like, they don't have enough people to where, let's say they wanted to write a law and pass it, they don't have enough people to do that.

829
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:35,479
Scott: They can't do anything they want to do.

830
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:41,760
Scott: But, they have enough people, mathematically, to where they can stop someone else doing what they want to do.

831
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:51,020
Scott: Now, it's slightly more complicated than that, because I don't want to get into the details of the Senate- You need to at least get a few of these crazy people to agree with something if you want to make it happen.

832
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,508
Rym: Actually, you don't.

833
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:52,040
Rym: Here's the trouble.

834
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:56,280
Rym: So, the Senate, for once, is actually working fine.

835
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:56,819
Scott: Of course.

836
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:04,800
Rym: But the House, the problem, and to get back to Lincoln's thing, isn't just that this tiny part of the government can shut things down and fuck things up.

837
00:41:05,582 --> 00:41:18,640
Rym: The reason they can do this, in this case, and shut the government down, is that Republicans pushed forth all this stuff back in the day, to where we have to keep passing these bills, periodically, to keep the government going.

838
00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:20,499
Rym: For no good reason.

839
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,759
Scott: Yeah, basically when they write the law, in the law they say, "This law expires

840
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:24,799
Scott: X."

841
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:25,581
Scott: Right?

842
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:27,531
Scott: And it's like, we don't have to write the law.

843
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,280
Scott: that way, we can write whatever law we please.

844
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,176
Scott: Why don't they write the law to say, "This law lasts

845
00:41:32,216 --> 00:41:32,578
Scott: forever!"?

846
00:41:33,062 --> 00:41:38,450
Rym: Well, because- Every time this comes up, they have the option of saying, "Fuck you!

847
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:41,558
Rym: Do X, or we won't pass a

848
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:41,779
Rym: bill.".

849
00:41:42,181 --> 00:41:42,308
Scott: Right.

850
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:59,240
Scott: They can hold the government hostage- If you want this law, you need some of us to say yes on this bill to make it happen, therefore, if you don't do what we say, and we say, "Put in an expiration date," and if you don't do that, it won't happen, but if you do what we say and put the expiration date, then maybe we'll vote yes on there.

851
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:02,501
Rym: So let's go back to the election of 1860.

852
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:12,500
Rym: Lincoln won, the majority of Americans were against slavery, and the Republicans, now the Democrats, effectively won the election.

853
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:24,500
Scott: The people who lost the election, they lost because- So most of the people in the country, though not all, wanted slavery gone, they voted against it, and they won- But the entire South basically voted for it-.

854
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,860
Scott: There were enough people who still like slavery, though.

855
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:35,060
Rym: The South voted entirely for it, but simultaneously split their vote between a really crazy and a moderate crazy.

856
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,499
Rym: Kind of like what's going on now.

857
00:42:38,441 --> 00:42:41,271
Rym: So when they lost the election, they said, "Well, fuck it.

858
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:42,394
Rym: We're shutting it all down.

859
00:42:42,455 --> 00:42:43,137
Rym: We're seceding.

860
00:42:43,257 --> 00:42:43,558
Rym: Fuck you

861
00:42:43,598 --> 00:42:43,920
Rym: guys.".

862
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:50,958
Rym: They basically said, "We lost the election, so we're going to not use the government

863
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:51,440
Rym: anymore.".

864
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:52,023
Scott: Right.

865
00:42:52,284 --> 00:42:54,880
Scott: It's like, that's all there is to it.

866
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:55,900
Scott: And that's what they're doing now.

867
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,700
Scott: It's supposed to be that we all vote, and it's like, imagine if you're with your friends, and you vote on where to go to dinner, right?

868
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,740
Scott: And six people vote to get pizza, and four people vote hamburgers.

869
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,809
Scott: And the four hamburger people are like, "Well, I didn't get my way.

870
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:11,478
Scott: I'm going to hamburgers anyway.

871
00:43:11,498 --> 00:43:11,779
Scott: Fuck you

872
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:11,940
Scott: guys.".

873
00:43:13,002 --> 00:43:13,638
Scott: That's what's going on.

874
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,200
Scott: That's exactly what's happening.

875
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:28,140
Scott: Now, in the past- Ignore the people who won and are in charge of their own little world.

876
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:36,760
Rym: Now, in the past, when things like this would happen, the Democrats can't really muster one combined testicle or ovary between a lot of them.

877
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,880
Rym: So they would always compromise on any issue like this, and kind of move toward the Republicans.

878
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,920
Rym: But the Republicans just back right the fuck up every time, because it always works.

879
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,039
Rym: So now, for the first time ever, the Democratic Party said no.

880
00:43:51,823 --> 00:43:56,260
Rym: If, like Lincoln said here, what's Lincoln saying if you can't interpret that paragraph I read?

881
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,230
Scott: If you can't understand 1800 Es?

882
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:07,636
Rym: He's saying, if you let them hold the government hostage to overturn the electorate, then they will do that every time.

883
00:44:07,677 --> 00:44:09,219
Rym: they don't get their way forever.

884
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,560
Scott: Right, you're basically saying as long as any number of crazies, if they have a signi- you know, it doesn't even have to be a majority, right?

885
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:19,955
Scott: Suddenly, a minority can rule, basically, as long as they have enough.

886
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:21,360
Scott: It doesn't have to be the majority.

887
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:33,416
Scott: So even though most of the people in the country want one thing, what's gonna happen is something that a minority of the crazies want, simply because they're using a crazy strategy of, "We'll just burn the house down if you don't do what we

888
00:44:33,456 --> 00:44:33,698
Scott: say.".

889
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,318
Scott: Like a, you know, like a little child who's like, "Oh, if you won't buy me that toy, then I'm gonna cry and make a mess in the house and break

890
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:40,779
Scott: everything.".

891
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:49,040
Scott: So you had to buy me that toy, even though there are four people in this family besides you, you know, the little kid just gets his way just by screaming and crying.

892
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:56,280
Scott: And if you give the kid what he wants, you know, to make him shut up, guess what happens next time you're in the toy store?

893
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,678
Rym: I don't know why, but all I can think of- Screaming and crying again.

894
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,699
Rym: All I can think of while you were saying that is the baby in dinosaurs.

895
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:09,920
Scott: Yeah, so the only option is to let the baby scream and cry and mess up everything in the house.

896
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:11,779
Scott: Or beat it up.

897
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,139
Rym: Here's what happened this time.

898
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,239
Scott: Or throw it out the window.

899
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,778
Rym: For all of you non-US listeners.

900
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,739
Scott: Or like my mom down the incinerator till her friend Debbie saved me.

901
00:45:20,127 --> 00:45:20,498
Rym: For now.

902
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:23,798
Scott: I don't think I fit down the incinerator anymore.

903
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,299
Rym: The incinerator of Damocles is waiting under you.

904
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,999
Scott: She literally saved me from the incinerator.

905
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,940
Rym: So, the Republican Party is the moron party.

906
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:32,580
Scott: Of course.

907
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,704
Rym: Don't get us wrong.

908
00:45:33,724 --> 00:45:35,612
Rym: It is their fault 100%.

909
00:45:35,612 --> 00:45:37,360
Rym: But within that party, there are two factions.

910
00:45:38,722 --> 00:45:40,100
Rym: The moderate Republicans.

911
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,879
Scott: Who are like- They're crazy.

912
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,202
Rym: They're morons.

913
00:45:43,524 --> 00:45:44,246
Rym: They're bad.

914
00:45:44,587 --> 00:45:47,317
Rym: But at least they're like your old enemy.

915
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:48,040
Rym: Like in the Prince of Nothing.

916
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:48,600
Scott: Like Bill O'Reilly?

917
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,303
Rym: It's like the Prince of Nothing.

918
00:45:50,644 --> 00:45:57,800
Rym: The old enemy, where you at least, you and your old enemy understand each other and know when to fight and when to kinda just go through the motions.

919
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,700
Scott: It's like they disagree with you, but they're not totally fucked the fuck up.

920
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,767
Rym: They're like, "Look, backdoor deal.

921
00:46:03,787 --> 00:46:05,252
Rym: We gotta do something to make this work.

922
00:46:05,353 --> 00:46:07,119
Rym: Alright, well I'll give you this, you give me that.

923
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:07,300
Rym: Let's do

924
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:07,360
Rym: it.".

925
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:07,581
Rym: Right.

926
00:46:07,702 --> 00:46:11,300
Scott: It's like you've got Superman and the old enemy is Lex Luthor.

927
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,980
Rym: Like Lex Luthor's not gonna destroy the entire planet to get Superman because his shit's there.

928
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:16,621
Scott: Right.

929
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:17,385
Scott: Maybe.

930
00:46:17,465 --> 00:46:18,310
Scott: Well, I know.

931
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,260
Scott: I haven't read enough stupid DC Comics.

932
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,780
Rym: Yeah, it depends on which era of Lex Luthor.

933
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:23,921
Rym: Right?

934
00:46:24,221 --> 00:46:28,811
Scott: But, you know, the crazy enemy is like Doomsday.

935
00:46:29,172 --> 00:46:29,413
Scott: Right?

936
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,700
Scott: He shows up, he kills Superman because he's just so crazy powerful.

937
00:46:33,522 --> 00:46:42,880
Rym: So, the Tea Party side of the Republicans will say they're gonna burn it all down if they don't get what they want, but unlike the moderate Republicans, they'll actually do it.

938
00:46:43,265 --> 00:46:43,340
Scott: Yup.

939
00:46:44,321 --> 00:46:49,890
Rym: And my guess is that eventually John Boehner and the moderate Republicans were like, "You know what?

940
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:50,651
Rym: Fine.

941
00:46:51,413 --> 00:46:51,733
Rym: Fuck it.

942
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:52,294
Rym: Go for it.

943
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:53,176
Rym: This is what you want?

944
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:54,258
Rym: This is what you want?

945
00:46:54,658 --> 00:46:55,199
Rym: Let's do

946
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:55,340
Rym: it.".

947
00:46:55,881 --> 00:46:57,326
Rym: And the Democrats were like, "Yeah, fuck you.

948
00:46:58,269 --> 00:46:58,630
Rym: Have fun.

949
00:46:59,092 --> 00:46:59,453
Rym: We'll wait.

950
00:47:00,457 --> 00:47:00,798
Rym: Clock is

951
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:01,079
Rym: ticking.".

952
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:01,744
Rym: Yeah.

953
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:02,491
Rym: And here we are.

954
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:03,320
Rym: Government shutdown.

955
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:20,220
Scott: So, you know, government shutdown, you know, the problem with the government shutdown, of course, is in and of itself doesn't cause enough pain to anybody to, you know, in particular, or enough people, or enough pain to actually bring about change.

956
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:21,461
Scott: Right?

957
00:47:21,821 --> 00:47:34,760
Scott: It's like there's very few people who are, you know, up in arms enough, deprived of enough bread and circuses such that, you know, there's gonna be any sort of uprising or push to actually fix anything.

958
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,008
Scott: And basically, so these people in Washington know how to do anything.

959
00:47:38,028 --> 00:47:39,872
Scott: And also these crazies, right?

960
00:47:40,133 --> 00:47:43,040
Scott: The only people the crazies have to answer to are the people who voted for them.

961
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:47,227
Scott: And in the place they live, in their gerrymandered district, right?

962
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:48,670
Scott: It's all crazies.

963
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:52,898
Scott: So even though the whole rest of the country is like, "You guys are crazy.

964
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:53,739
Scott: What the fuck is wrong with

965
00:47:53,779 --> 00:47:53,860
Scott: you?".

966
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:56,685
Scott: Those people don't vote for that crazy.

967
00:47:56,725 --> 00:48:01,660
Scott: That crazy only represents this, you know, place in the desert or in the south where a bunch of hicks live.

968
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,863
Scott: So they're all crazy.

969
00:48:03,405 --> 00:48:05,271
Scott: And those hicks are very happy with this.

970
00:48:05,331 --> 00:48:08,280
Scott: And the government shutdown doesn't hurt those hicks one bit.

971
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:16,340
Rym: So thus explaining why these so-called moderate Republicans are letting the crazy people get what they want because of challenges from the right.

972
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:29,300
Rym: If you're a Republican, even if you're really conservative, and you vote with the Democrats to just get the government working again, they'll brand you as a traitor, a rhino, a Republican in any name only.

973
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,371
Scott: Because remember, the people who are voting for these crazies are dumb people.

974
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:36,480
Scott: So you have to appeal to dumbness, which is really easy.

975
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,066
Scott: That's how they got in power in the first place.

976
00:48:38,146 --> 00:48:40,797
Scott: It's easy to brainwash and propaganda.

977
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:41,400
Scott: dumb people.

978
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,223
Rym: You think Americans don't vote in elections?

979
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:45,808
Rym: Americans fucking don't vote in primaries.

980
00:48:45,828 --> 00:48:52,040
Rym: The only people who vote in primaries are super politically motivated people and horrible old conservative busybodies.

981
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:52,501
Scott: Right.

982
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:55,627
Scott: So basically you you that's what you did.

983
00:48:55,687 --> 00:48:56,549
Scott: That was your strategy.

984
00:48:56,589 --> 00:49:01,659
Scott: to get elected was to brainwash and appeal to crazies and stupids to get them to vote for you.

985
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:01,779
Scott: Right.

986
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:07,126
Scott: So now you are basically beholden to stupids and crazies.

987
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:18,840
Scott: So if you do intelligent things, somebody else who's crazier than you can now basically tell the crazies, oh, this guy who said he was on your side, you know, compromised a little bit.

988
00:49:20,762 --> 00:49:21,023
Scott: Right.

989
00:49:21,263 --> 00:49:29,657
Scott: So the same weapons that you were using against your enemies are now used on you if you don't actually do the crazy things that you said you would do.

990
00:49:30,138 --> 00:49:30,339
Scott: Right.

991
00:49:30,379 --> 00:49:31,160
Scott: Just to get in office.

992
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,864
Rym: So the moderate Republicans have basically a gun to their head.

993
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:44,100
Rym: If they do business as usual and fix this or do any sort of compromise, some ridiculous far right guy will come in to the right of them, no matter how far right they are.

994
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,743
Rym: Right means conservative and stupid in the US.

995
00:49:47,063 --> 00:49:49,646
Rym: Left means liberal and usually also stupid.

996
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:52,789
Rym: But I guess so.

997
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:56,753
Rym: People will come in to the right of you more conservative.

998
00:49:57,213 --> 00:50:03,820
Rym: And the only people who decide who gets to run for the Republican office are the people who vote in the primaries.

999
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,844
Scott: The most crazy people in the people who have nothing better to do.

1000
00:50:08,284 --> 00:50:11,587
Rym: The craziest of the crazies are the only people who vote in those things.

1001
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:17,572
Rym: So, yeah, my prediction of what's going to happen in the end of all this.

1002
00:50:17,692 --> 00:50:18,653
Rym: And then I want to talk.

1003
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:26,040
Scott: I want to let Scott explain his idea for how maybe the only way I think we can fix anything in this country in a short amount of time.

1004
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:34,048
Rym: So my prediction of what's going to happen is that the moderate Republicans, if they do anything, there's going to be this problem.

1005
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:45,160
Rym: I think nothing is going to happen and the government is going to stay shut down until we get to that other deadline that's coming up, the debt ceiling, which that is actually for real a big deal if we don't.

1006
00:50:46,261 --> 00:50:54,030
Scott: If they don't do what they need to do then and they keep holding out and keep just holding everyone hostage, basically all the economy will collapse.

1007
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:57,655
Rym: This is the equivalent of pissing in my own bed to prove a point.

1008
00:50:58,335 --> 00:51:00,618
Scott: It's like the country isn't doing what I want to do.

1009
00:51:00,698 --> 00:51:02,180
Scott: So I'm just going to burn the whole country.

1010
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,483
Rym: You feel like a king of the world when you first piss in your bed.

1011
00:51:06,503 --> 00:51:09,885
Scott: Well, they managed to get past the last debt ceiling situation.

1012
00:51:10,245 --> 00:51:10,425
Scott: Yeah.

1013
00:51:10,465 --> 00:51:11,586
Scott: And they pushed it off until.

1014
00:51:11,646 --> 00:51:12,767
Rym: Well, here's what I predict.

1015
00:51:12,827 --> 00:51:13,788
Rym: Democrats don't budge.

1016
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:16,370
Rym: We get to the debt ceiling debate.

1017
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:26,477
Rym: Eventually enough moderate Republicans defect and vote with the Democrats just to get things going again with minimal compromises from the Democrats.

1018
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:31,320
Rym: Then the Republican crazies go apeshit.

1019
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,001
Scott: I'd rather see.

1020
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:34,702
Rym: They're going to burn down.

1021
00:51:34,722 --> 00:51:39,766
Rym: They're going to go apeshit to a degree that will define the term apeshit.

1022
00:51:40,046 --> 00:51:41,827
Rym: Imagine someone going apeshit.

1023
00:51:42,087 --> 00:51:43,748
Rym: That is what you will see on the floor of the house.

1024
00:51:44,389 --> 00:51:49,532
Rym: And then there's going to be crazy, crazy crazies coming in from the right in the Republican primaries.

1025
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:54,135
Rym: And I don't think they're going to win general elections.

1026
00:51:54,195 --> 00:52:00,960
Rym: I think Democrats are going to replace them because the people that the crazies are going to target the most are the ones that are going to win general elections.

1027
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:07,304
Rym: The Republicans that are near sane places in the US, like suburbs of the big cities.

1028
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:13,328
Rym: So I think the Republicans are going to destroy themselves over the course of the next 18 months.

1029
00:52:14,529 --> 00:52:25,537
Scott: I think I hope they burn it down and the debt ceiling doesn't work, because even though that would suck for everybody, I think that, you know, the government shutdown doesn't cause enough, you know, bread and circuses.

1030
00:52:25,597 --> 00:52:25,817
Scott: Right.

1031
00:52:26,217 --> 00:52:28,599
Scott: We still have bread and circuses, even though the government is shut down.

1032
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:30,500
Rym: Oh, I'm not saying what I want to have.

1033
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:32,102
Rym: If they

1034
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:47,740
Scott: fuck up the debt ceiling, then there will actually be a lack of bread and circuses in a significant way to where every even people just ignore fucking politics and don't even give a shit and don't pay attention and just living out their lives will be like, oh, shit, my shit is fucked up.

1035
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:49,202
Scott: I can't.

1036
00:52:49,642 --> 00:52:50,143
Scott: Oh, my God.

1037
00:52:50,183 --> 00:52:52,685
Scott: My life is basically ruined because of these crazies.

1038
00:52:53,226 --> 00:53:05,259
Scott: And then they'll be forced to do something and have a more drastic and rapid fixing after a short term pain, as opposed to putting in, you know, stitching up their wound and holding it together even longer.

1039
00:53:05,279 --> 00:53:05,379
Scott: Right.

1040
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:10,186
Rym: I think part of this, too, is that this fight is all over Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act.

1041
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:15,975
Rym: I think the Republicans are desperately afraid that it'll work or at least won't make things worse.

1042
00:53:16,095 --> 00:53:19,300
Rym: And then suddenly everything they've been saying for the last four years sounds really stupid.

1043
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:22,183
Scott: You know, that's that's how it is.

1044
00:53:22,203 --> 00:53:26,609
Scott: You know, when you when you when you're it's it's a battle of an ideologue versus a pragmatist.

1045
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:26,789
Scott: Right.

1046
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:29,212
Scott: If you have an ideology, basically, you believe in it on faith.

1047
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:30,053
Scott: Right.

1048
00:53:30,594 --> 00:53:32,857
Scott: And so it's like people who believe in God.

1049
00:53:32,897 --> 00:53:35,340
Scott: They don't want to hear the arguments that show that.

1050
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,787
Scott: No, they're probably most likely almost zero percent chance of there being a God.

1051
00:53:39,827 --> 00:53:39,947
Scott: Right.

1052
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,869
Scott: They just don't want to hear it.

1053
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,737
Scott: And if you actually had some evidence, say, to disprove somebody's I don't know, fake medicine.

1054
00:53:46,037 --> 00:53:47,179
Scott: They don't want to hear that either.

1055
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:47,600
Scott: Right.

1056
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,586
Scott: Because if you could actually prove them wrong, that just ruins their entire worldview.

1057
00:53:52,147 --> 00:53:52,388
Scott: Right.

1058
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:54,231
Scott: So they just believe this thing on faith.

1059
00:53:54,311 --> 00:53:56,114
Scott: No evidence whatsoever, even though it's wrong.

1060
00:53:57,075 --> 00:53:59,900
Scott: And basically the they're happy.

1061
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:09,576
Scott: They're lucky that they have the power to prevent you from doing the thing that goes against their ideology, because then that would be evidence in their face.

1062
00:54:09,616 --> 00:54:11,720
Scott: You know, basically bringing their world to a halt.

1063
00:54:11,861 --> 00:54:13,173
Scott: Everything I believed is wrong.

1064
00:54:13,193 --> 00:54:13,233
Scott: No.

1065
00:54:15,641 --> 00:54:26,640
Scott: So as long as they can prevent you from doing it, they never have to see that they're wrong and they can continue believing their lies and, you know, faith or and not have to have a crisis of faith of any kind.

1066
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,903
Scott: So keep living in their fantasy land.

1067
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:33,169
Rym: We live in New York in a sane place where there are no crazies.

1068
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:41,040
Rym: There are very few crazy where as a result, we have zero ability to in any way impact the situation.

1069
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,704
Scott: No, not by voting.

1070
00:54:42,964 --> 00:54:49,660
Rym: So, Scott, suppose we are type of person needed to change things in the government.

1071
00:54:49,881 --> 00:54:54,335
Scott: Well, so, you know, in throughout history, there have been many ways to change things in government.

1072
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:55,439
Scott: when voting doesn't work.

1073
00:54:55,499 --> 00:54:55,700
Scott: Right.

1074
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,732
Scott: So way number one, violent revolution.

1075
00:54:58,993 --> 00:55:00,320
Scott: Not going to work, guys.

1076
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:10,980
Scott: Not only, A, the people who are good have less guns than the people who are crazy, but B, even if we went and got guns, the government has better guns.

1077
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:18,817
Scott: And C, because of all the terrorism nonsense, which we would like to fix, the government and even the police have way too many guns.

1078
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,300
Scott: They're basically just armies everywhere.

1079
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:21,861
Scott: You can't.

1080
00:55:22,142 --> 00:55:22,743
Scott: There's nothing.

1081
00:55:23,064 --> 00:55:24,727
Scott: Also, violence is bad.

1082
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:26,190
Scott: I don't want to kill cops.

1083
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:26,951
Scott: It's not their fault.

1084
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:28,113
Scott: They didn't do it.

1085
00:55:28,554 --> 00:55:29,436
Scott: They agree with me.

1086
00:55:29,897 --> 00:55:30,738
Scott: They're just doing a job.

1087
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:31,520
Scott: Right.

1088
00:55:31,901 --> 00:55:33,687
Rym: Except for the Nazis were just doing their job.

1089
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,770
Scott: Except for the bad cops.

1090
00:55:35,993 --> 00:55:36,936
Scott: You know, the bad cops.

1091
00:55:37,097 --> 00:55:38,140
Scott: Those are the ones, you know, right?

1092
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,048
Scott: So speaking of bad cops, beating up protesters, right?

1093
00:55:41,068 --> 00:55:42,553
Scott: We can go protest like dirty hippies.

1094
00:55:43,175 --> 00:55:43,997
Rym: Yeah, that doesn't do anything.

1095
00:55:44,038 --> 00:55:44,780
Scott: It doesn't do anything.

1096
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,344
Scott: Because who has to listen to a bunch of...

1097
00:55:46,364 --> 00:55:48,148
Rym: Remember your rally for sanity?

1098
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:50,194
Scott: Remember your Occupy?

1099
00:55:50,274 --> 00:55:50,655
Scott: Nothing?

1100
00:55:51,497 --> 00:55:51,758
Scott: Right?

1101
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:52,520
Scott: You know who shows up?

1102
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,686
Scott: People with no jobs and hippies and crazies.

1103
00:55:55,827 --> 00:56:01,140
Scott: And even people who agree with them are just like, there's no, we don't have to listen to anything you say.

1104
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:07,020
Rym: Speaking of people with no jobs, speaking of people with no jobs, I biked to work at like 10 this morning because I was doing some stuff first.

1105
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:11,230
Rym: So after normal people go to normal jobs, it was all fixies.

1106
00:56:11,811 --> 00:56:12,031
Scott: Yeah.

1107
00:56:12,432 --> 00:56:15,480
Rym: It's all the people without jobs are riding fixies at 10 o'clock.

1108
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,607
Rym: All the people with normal jobs are riding normal bikes at like nine.

1109
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:18,868
Scott: Yep.

1110
00:56:19,269 --> 00:56:19,530
Rym: Anyway.

1111
00:56:19,811 --> 00:56:19,991
Scott: Yeah.

1112
00:56:20,432 --> 00:56:23,140
Scott: So if you go out and protest, people just ignore you.

1113
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,922
Scott: You're a crazy hippie.

1114
00:56:23,942 --> 00:56:24,985
Scott: That's completely pointless.

1115
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:25,868
Scott: Doesn't do anything.

1116
00:56:26,229 --> 00:56:26,470
Scott: Right.

1117
00:56:27,112 --> 00:56:28,034
Scott: So what else can we do?

1118
00:56:28,095 --> 00:56:29,920
Scott: Write letters to our representatives.

1119
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:33,149
Scott: My representative already is on my side.

1120
00:56:33,169 --> 00:56:36,920
Scott: You know, they're not perfect, but they're on the right side of this issue.

1121
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,860
Rym: I just initiated a gas attack in this room, but I don't think it's gonna have much effect outside of this room.

1122
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,581
Scott: Trail of tears.

1123
00:56:42,661 --> 00:56:43,343
Scott: Yeah.

1124
00:56:43,363 --> 00:56:45,648
Scott: So really, like, what can we do?

1125
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:46,049
Scott: Right.

1126
00:56:46,089 --> 00:56:47,392
Scott: So we have to look through history.

1127
00:56:47,713 --> 00:56:47,934
Scott: Right.

1128
00:56:47,974 --> 00:56:50,540
Scott: And we look back and we try to find people who are able to do this.

1129
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:59,060
Scott: Any instance in all of history, someone was able to have a change in their government from the bottom up, you know, who didn't have political power, maybe with a, you know, group of people, whatever.

1130
00:56:59,160 --> 00:56:59,902
Scott: So let's go back.

1131
00:57:00,544 --> 00:57:02,087
Scott: Martin Luther King, civil disobedience.

1132
00:57:02,147 --> 00:57:02,268
Scott: Right.

1133
00:57:02,308 --> 00:57:02,829
Scott: We can do that.

1134
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:03,290
Rym: Yeah.

1135
00:57:03,811 --> 00:57:07,340
Scott: That won't really work today either, because we'll just end our asses up in jail.

1136
00:57:07,881 --> 00:57:08,522
Scott: Right.

1137
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,486
Scott: And this issue.

1138
00:57:10,587 --> 00:57:10,707
Scott: Right.

1139
00:57:10,747 --> 00:57:11,669
Scott: So Martin Luther King.

1140
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:12,150
Scott: Right.

1141
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:13,573
Scott: The issue he was fighting.

1142
00:57:13,914 --> 00:57:15,978
Scott: He broke the laws that he was trying to get rid of.

1143
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:16,680
Scott: Right.

1144
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,223
Scott: So it's like we pirate music.

1145
00:57:18,263 --> 00:57:19,386
Scott: We'd like to get rid of those laws.

1146
00:57:20,649 --> 00:57:20,890
Scott: Right.

1147
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,734
Scott: But what law can we break here?

1148
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:23,416
Scott: Right.

1149
00:57:23,597 --> 00:57:25,020
Scott: That would be the law that we're trying.

1150
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,724
Scott: Can we go and just give people health care?

1151
00:57:27,804 --> 00:57:28,665
Scott: I don't know.

1152
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:31,288
Scott: What are we supposed to do?

1153
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:32,109
Scott: Are we supposed to?

1154
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,832
Scott: I don't know what.

1155
00:57:33,872 --> 00:57:37,637
Scott: There is no law to be disobedient to because we're not the ones who have to obey this law.

1156
00:57:37,677 --> 00:57:40,020
Scott: The government, the Treasury, I guess, has to obey this law.

1157
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,481
Scott: Right.

1158
00:57:40,962 --> 00:57:48,520
Scott: So even if we were civil disobedient, there's no civil to disobedient in this case, and we'd all just end up in jail and it wouldn't matter.

1159
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,144
Scott: There's only one thing I could think of that we could do.

1160
00:57:52,444 --> 00:57:52,705
Scott: Right.

1161
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:55,970
Scott: So I looked even further back to Gandhi.

1162
00:57:56,251 --> 00:57:56,451
Scott: Right.

1163
00:57:56,491 --> 00:58:02,060
Scott: And what Gandhi did is he would do stuff like, yeah, we're just going to take all this salt and dump it in the ocean.

1164
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,263
Scott: And it's like, well, dumping salt in the ocean.

1165
00:58:04,303 --> 00:58:07,529
Scott: It's like they dumped tea in the ocean, you know, in the US.

1166
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:07,809
Scott: Right.

1167
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:08,611
Scott: What does that matter?

1168
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:13,499
Scott: It's like that mattered because salt was fucking expensive and it's protesting salt taxes.

1169
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:13,940
Scott: Right.

1170
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:14,621
Scott: That was what it was.

1171
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:16,224
Scott: Pretty sure it was protesting salt taxes.

1172
00:58:16,584 --> 00:58:16,785
Scott: Right.

1173
00:58:17,065 --> 00:58:20,050
Scott: It was relevant and it actually caused damage.

1174
00:58:20,391 --> 00:58:20,591
Scott: Right.

1175
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:25,559
Scott: He caused damage in a nonviolent way such that people were harmed.

1176
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,160
Scott: Right.

1177
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,726
Scott: It's not harmed physically, violently, but he was able to damage people.

1178
00:58:31,027 --> 00:58:31,247
Scott: Right.

1179
00:58:31,547 --> 00:58:33,490
Scott: Such that they had to do something about it.

1180
00:58:33,731 --> 00:58:33,951
Scott: Right.

1181
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:35,533
Scott: So they couldn't just let him do this.

1182
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:37,316
Scott: You know, he would also do like hunger strikes.

1183
00:58:37,376 --> 00:58:40,080
Scott: And it's like, well, if he died, it's now your fault.

1184
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,261
Scott: So now, you know, right.

1185
00:58:41,662 --> 00:58:43,684
Scott: And it's sort of like, well, shit, they can't have that.

1186
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:48,469
Scott: And the British were forced to, you know, basically let India be its own country eventually.

1187
00:58:48,749 --> 00:58:48,970
Scott: Right.

1188
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:58,580
Scott: So what can we do like that that we could maybe possibly no one's going to do it doesn't matter is we could just not work.

1189
00:58:59,121 --> 00:59:00,062
Scott: A general strike.

1190
00:59:00,262 --> 00:59:00,742
Scott: Nobody.

1191
00:59:01,123 --> 00:59:01,724
Scott: Period.

1192
00:59:02,545 --> 00:59:03,245
Scott: Even essential.

1193
00:59:03,325 --> 00:59:07,971
Scott: Well, I don't know if essential people really have to like do the you know, just nobody goes to work.

1194
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:09,293
Scott: But what does nobody mean?

1195
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,595
Scott: Like, would it work if the firemen still went to work?

1196
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:13,838
Scott: or maybe even the firemen don't go to work?

1197
00:59:14,038 --> 00:59:15,500
Scott: Even the doctors don't go to work.

1198
00:59:16,101 --> 00:59:17,944
Scott: Even the military doesn't go to work.

1199
00:59:18,204 --> 00:59:23,693
Rym: Our demographic, if all of us stop going to work, a lot of things stop working really quick.

1200
00:59:23,854 --> 00:59:24,375
Scott: Exactly.

1201
00:59:24,455 --> 00:59:27,520
Scott: And it's like you look and it's like not going to work.

1202
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,264
Scott: All the rich people suddenly have no money.

1203
00:59:32,326 --> 00:59:32,586
Scott: Right.

1204
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:36,831
Scott: It's like, oh, you want to take money away from a rich guy and you can't pass a law to tax him?

1205
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,854
Scott: Just no one shows up to work.

1206
00:59:38,934 --> 00:59:41,798
Scott: Suddenly, his company is losing billions of dollars a day.

1207
00:59:41,818 --> 00:59:43,360
Scott: It's like, what now, rich guy?

1208
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,527
Rym: So you're advocating a sort of Atlas Shrugged general strike, right?

1209
00:59:47,547 --> 00:59:48,047
Scott: Is it basically?

1210
00:59:48,108 --> 00:59:53,697
Scott: if none of that, you know, Atlas Shrugged was like, yeah, the smart people don't go to work in this fantasy libertarian land.

1211
00:59:53,777 --> 00:59:55,740
Scott: I'm saying nobody go to work.

1212
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,502
Scott: Janitor doesn't go to work.

1213
00:59:57,822 --> 00:59:58,123
Scott: Right.

1214
00:59:59,004 --> 01:00:03,729
Scott: Draw taxi driver doesn't drive his taxi like nobody goes to work.

1215
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:04,690
Scott: Right.

1216
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:05,511
Scott: And we do that.

1217
01:00:06,072 --> 01:00:19,446
Scott: And it's like, all right, government, nobody is working or at least enough people, you know, or certain people in enough quantity and enough important positions are not working such that it is causing, you know, people distress.

1218
01:00:19,806 --> 01:00:20,027
Scott: Right.

1219
01:00:20,307 --> 01:00:21,308
Scott: Such that they are upset.

1220
01:00:21,348 --> 01:00:23,510
Scott: And they like we we can't not fix this.

1221
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:31,277
Scott: We had these people need to go back to work, but they refused to do so until, you know, you fix the health care and you do these things that we want.

1222
01:00:31,357 --> 01:00:34,620
Scott: Otherwise, it's going to actually be painful for a lot of people.

1223
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,142
Scott: And they're going to be really upset.

1224
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:36,963
Scott: And it's your fault.

1225
01:00:37,003 --> 01:00:37,323
Scott: That's right.

1226
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:38,504
Scott: It's like Gandhi's hunger strike.

1227
01:00:38,544 --> 01:00:38,664
Scott: Right.

1228
01:00:38,684 --> 01:00:41,468
Scott: It's like it's your fault if Gandhi dies because you're not.

1229
01:00:41,508 --> 01:00:43,229
Scott: he's not eating because you're not doing what he said.

1230
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:51,619
Scott: So it's like it's your fault if, you know, these people in the hospital die because the doctors aren't working because you didn't fix the health care.

1231
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:52,079
Scott: bullshit.

1232
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:52,740
Scott: Right.

1233
01:00:53,261 --> 01:00:53,801
Scott: And those.

1234
01:00:53,821 --> 01:00:59,229
Scott: So now not only the doctors, they were originally upset, but now the people who are dying are upset and the families who are dying upset.

1235
01:00:59,269 --> 01:00:59,389
Scott: Right.

1236
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:00,931
Scott: It's like one person not going to work.

1237
01:01:01,352 --> 01:01:01,512
Scott: Right.

1238
01:01:01,612 --> 01:01:03,194
Scott: They don't pick up the garbage for a few weeks.

1239
01:01:03,755 --> 01:01:07,140
Scott: That's thousands of people because like two or three people didn't work.

1240
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:12,567
Scott: So we just had to reach a critical mass of people not working and refusing to work until shit is fixed.

1241
01:01:12,948 --> 01:01:14,670
Scott: And that will force them to fix shit.

1242
01:01:15,211 --> 01:01:17,534
Rym: Now, that is almost where a real rally is.

1243
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:23,202
Rym: Imagine those people not only don't go to work, but they all just go to D.C Yeah, it doesn't matter if they go to

1244
01:01:23,242 --> 01:01:23,422
Rym: D.C.,

1245
01:01:23,442 --> 01:01:29,351
Rym: they can just stay home and drink, you know, one thing that the general strike does not give you for a while.

1246
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:31,555
Rym: And that's the media frenzy.

1247
01:01:32,195 --> 01:01:35,060
Scott: You can have a media frenzy without, you know, everyone going in.

1248
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,102
Rym: Enough people would go.

1249
01:01:37,122 --> 01:01:38,786
Rym: You just got to fill that mall and then you're good.

1250
01:01:39,127 --> 01:01:41,893
Scott: I mean, I would just instead of I would not go to the rally.

1251
01:01:41,913 --> 01:01:42,554
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

1252
01:01:42,594 --> 01:01:43,055
Rym: I know better.

1253
01:01:43,396 --> 01:01:45,160
Rym: But I would convince all of you to go to the rally.

1254
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:52,413
Scott: If I ran the rally, what I would try to do is have it not look like a hippie protest where everyone's got the signs and the chanting, whatever.

1255
01:01:52,593 --> 01:01:55,038
Rym: Well, Martin Luther King, they would march in their Sunday best.

1256
01:01:55,238 --> 01:01:56,180
Scott: I wouldn't march either.

1257
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,442
Scott: Marching is also pointless.

1258
01:01:57,482 --> 01:01:58,824
Scott: What I would do is I would party.

1259
01:01:58,885 --> 01:02:00,668
Scott: I would be like, all right, everyone, you're not going to work.

1260
01:02:01,049 --> 01:02:04,194
Scott: Let's all go to the National Mall and party.

1261
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:04,575
Scott: Drunken.

1262
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:07,240
Scott: It'd be like drunken Central Park party day.

1263
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:08,322
Rym: I don't know.

1264
01:02:08,362 --> 01:02:08,623
Rym: I don't know.

1265
01:02:08,883 --> 01:02:10,126
Scott: Like everyone's we're not working.

1266
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:11,508
Scott: We're having a grand old time.

1267
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:16,338
Scott: Everyone's just picnicking and you know, it's all good here.

1268
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:16,438
Scott: Yeah.

1269
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,182
Scott: So what?

1270
01:02:18,363 --> 01:02:20,651
Rym: what issue would it take for us to try to make this happen?

1271
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:23,120
Rym: Is that I'm not I knew it over what's going on.

1272
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:23,982
Scott: I saw him.

1273
01:02:24,463 --> 01:02:26,207
Scott: Someone has to be the first guy.

1274
01:02:26,428 --> 01:02:27,631
Scott: Are you not going to go to work tomorrow?

1275
01:02:27,671 --> 01:02:30,960
Scott: If it would work, would you be the guy to start it, not go to work tomorrow?

1276
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:31,922
Rym: Over what?

1277
01:02:31,983 --> 01:02:32,644
Rym: Over this stuff?

1278
01:02:32,664 --> 01:02:33,106
Scott: Hell no.

1279
01:02:33,306 --> 01:02:33,527
Scott: All right.

1280
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:35,031
Scott: And also not go to work the next day.

1281
01:02:35,372 --> 01:02:36,655
Rym: Over what's going on now now.

1282
01:02:36,896 --> 01:02:37,177
Scott: Yeah.

1283
01:02:37,237 --> 01:02:38,220
Scott: OK, so there you go.

1284
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,088
Scott: I asked my co-workers, I said, would anyone here not go to work?

1285
01:02:42,128 --> 01:02:43,251
Scott: They said, no, we're going to work.

1286
01:02:43,452 --> 01:02:46,660
Rym: For me, it would take it would have to be First Amendment losses.

1287
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:47,301
Scott: Right.

1288
01:02:47,341 --> 01:02:47,621
Scott: But no.

1289
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,905
Scott: What if there was you want to do a positive change?

1290
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:52,129
Scott: Like you could demand something and get your demand.

1291
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:58,400
Scott: The thing is, I would need like imagine if we could like demand single payer real health care for reals, not just Obamacare.

1292
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,492
Scott: We would get it if you just, you know, went on strike.

1293
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:02,114
Scott: You know, you need.

1294
01:03:02,135 --> 01:03:03,540
Rym: you need almost a Kickstarter for this.

1295
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,663
Rym: You need the week.

1296
01:03:04,704 --> 01:03:07,292
Rym: We should we call it first follower.

1297
01:03:07,393 --> 01:03:08,115
Rym: Here's how it works.

1298
01:03:08,376 --> 01:03:09,299
Rym: You make a cause.

1299
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:15,600
Rym: But and you all sort of sign a contract like I will strike if we reach the threshold.

1300
01:03:16,521 --> 01:03:17,462
Scott: But nobody will.

1301
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:18,985
Scott: People sign it and they won't do it.

1302
01:03:19,165 --> 01:03:26,920
Rym: Well, you may you make the site kind of set up as a contract with real verified contact info, a contract that you physically sign.

1303
01:03:27,462 --> 01:03:28,908
Scott: And what if they don't show up?

1304
01:03:28,948 --> 01:03:29,410
Scott: What happens to?

1305
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,695
Scott: what's the penalty for not showing up?

1306
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:31,900
Rym: I know a breach of contract.

1307
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,660
Scott: So I'm going to go around and sue all these individual people who said that they would stop working, went to work.

1308
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,964
Rym: That'd be a pretty good business model.

1309
01:03:38,446 --> 01:03:39,891
Rym: Sue them for damages to my cause.

1310
01:03:41,095 --> 01:03:42,340
Scott: I don't know if you'd get away with that.

1311
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,082
Rym: You might be able to.

1312
01:03:43,563 --> 01:03:43,965
Scott: Unlikely.

1313
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:45,590
Rym: Or in the very least, a site like that.

1314
01:03:45,851 --> 01:03:48,660
Rym: It's just that you need enough people to do it at once.

1315
01:03:49,221 --> 01:03:54,619
Rym: So it's not just the one lone wacko who loses his job and then no one cares because he can't afford to still be on the Internet talking about it.

1316
01:03:55,861 --> 01:04:03,260
Rym: You need enough people to go at once and you need some modicum of assurance that if you do it, all these people do it together.

1317
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:09,617
Rym: Like the first 10,000 people have to all do it together and make a big media shitstorm like the first 10,000 all go to D.C.

1318
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:13,528
Rym: and go and say none of us are working.

1319
01:04:13,588 --> 01:04:17,380
Rym: We all left our jobs, drove here and are staying here.

1320
01:04:19,301 --> 01:04:20,545
Scott: It's sort of a catch-22, right?

1321
01:04:20,685 --> 01:04:25,100
Scott: It's like nobody will go to those lengths as long as they still have bread and circuses.

1322
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,679
Scott: Because for all the shit that goes down in this country, it's like life is really great.

1323
01:04:30,881 --> 01:04:32,527
Scott: Everyday life for most of the people is pretty terrific.

1324
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,384
Rym: Also, the people where life isn't so great.

1325
01:04:38,404 --> 01:04:49,020
Scott: What you risk, if your life's not so great, what you risk by doing something like this is losing the last that you have and having nothing.

1326
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:50,120
Scott: Yep, exactly.

1327
01:04:50,881 --> 01:04:52,119
Rym: It's hard to ask someone to risk.

1328
01:04:53,160 --> 01:05:00,000
Scott: Unless there is already that harm to you, you're not going to get up and do something that's going to cause harm to you on purpose.

1329
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:04,447
Scott: But at the same time, it feeds into itself.

1330
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:10,700
Scott: The strike itself is the thing that would cause harm to people such that they would get upset and strike.

1331
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:20,100
Scott: The spark itself is the thing that can be caused by and result in the thing that needs to be done to bring about the change.

1332
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,700
Scott: So you have a chicken and egg, there's no way to make a chicken or an egg.

1333
01:05:24,481 --> 01:05:27,160
Rym: I'm hereby striking on GeekNights until I get some food.

1334
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:27,937
Scott: Sounds good.

1335
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:31,260
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1336
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,400
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1337
01:05:36,761 --> 01:05:41,800
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1338
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,747
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1339
01:05:44,887 --> 01:05:49,480
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1340
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,996
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1341
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,350
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1342
01:05:57,551 --> 01:06:00,420
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
