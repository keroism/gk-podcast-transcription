Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:34,309
Rym: I can't believe we haven't done a show on this movie But at the same time you can't believe nobody's even talked about this thing in a zillion years.

6
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:35,374
Rym: But there are.

7
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:40,920
Rym: there are relevant anecdotes that there is a history of this movie and us There are there.

8
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,769
Rym: there are reasons why we're talking about it.

9
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:45,263
Rym: We've said for years around Halloween.

10
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:47,734
Rym: Oh, we should do a Halloween special Why don't we do?

11
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:53,033

12
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:57,779
Scott: yeah, it's Halloween, which means let's see It's o 13. so 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 3 we can count like that.

00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,281
Scott: This would be beginning our 8th year.

14
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,950
Rym: 8th year of GeekNights.

15
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,498
Scott: We nights was a little kid.

16
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:08,168
Scott: It would be an 8 year old kid be like, hey kid.

17
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:08,490
Scott: What's up?

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,475
Scott: How's it going?

19
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:14,398
Rym: and also while we started on Baby instead, right?

20
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:16,326
Scott: Hmm instead of making GeekNights.

21
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:20,007
Scott: We could have made a bad V Maybe not together.

22
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:23,240
Scott: In so, you know, they got technology.

23
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,968
Rym: these we did start on October 31st.

24
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,919
Rym: But here's the deep secret of GeekNights for many.

25
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,488
Rym: We have a lot of new listeners from recent conventions.

26
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,845
Rym: one We actually started months before that doing beta episodes that we only let our.

27
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:37,190
Rym: we only gave links to our friends.

28
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,574
Rym: We were like, hey, we're doing this dumb podcast thing.

29
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:46,761
Rym: insert explanation of what a podcast is because that didn't really exist in a As a thing back then.

30
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,090
Scott: it just come into existence.

31
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:53,450
Scott: So, I mean it what did did exist for a while before then but it didn't come into popular existence.

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,960
Scott: It's like I do our day.

33
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,470
Scott: the iPod nano was released.

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:02,748
Scott: They updated iTunes and added podcasting in the podcast directory and that is the flyers we brought to.

35
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:07,483
Rym: Otakon 2006 had a section that was like what is a podcast?

36
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:08,989
Rym: How do you listen to them?

37
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:11,655
Rym: Good good old days.

38
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:12,700
Scott: don't need an iPod.

39
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,227
Scott: Yeah, you can play mp3s.

40
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:14,790
Scott: You can listen.

41
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:16,718
Rym: I think I have the flyers around somewhere.

42
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:19,530
Rym: I can go find exactly what text we wrote but regardless.

43
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:22,159
Rym: So we did all these beta episodes before that.

44
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,930
Rym: it seems like our listeners kind of obsessed with finding them and they're out there.

45
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,372
Rym: I checked.

46
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,518
Rym: you can just go download it.

47
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:27,624
Scott: There's not that many of them.

48
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:28,670
Rym: There's a decent number.

49
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,770
Rym: I think all the betas are up there.

50
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,643
Rym: I don't think there's any unreleased GeekNights at this point.

51
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:40,890
Scott: Mmm, but Yeah, the reason we never did a show some lost episodes, but those got deleted by accident or some shit.

52
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:42,165
Scott: So there's no way to bring them back.

53
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:46,723
Rym: Yep And then there's some collections of outtakes and there's a lot of beta episodes.

54
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:48,770
Rym: we recorded but didn't put up because they were shitty.

55
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:52,950
Rym: And then I think we just deleted them, but we put a lot of them online.

56
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:56,593
Rym: So, uh, yeah News time.

57
00:02:56,974 --> 00:03:00,905
Rym: well news time very briefly because anime people tell there's a big overlap.

58
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:02,429
Rym: Yeah packs is sold out.

59
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:03,854
Scott: Oh, that's a shame.

60
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:06,903
Rym: Thanks East 2014 in April is sold out.

61
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:07,686
Scott: That's a shame.

62
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:09,030
Rym: It went live today.

63
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:10,741
Rym: We I can't.

64
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:16,001
Rym: there's no point in even saying Oh, well, we you know We warned you whatever because the thing is warning doesn't even help.

65
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:20,824
Scott: any people seem to have heeded the warning this time And it was just who got in and who didn't.

66
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:21,770
Rym: it's a crapshoot.

67
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,121
Rym: There's nothing you can do to have a better chance of getting into packs.

68
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:33,310
Scott: unless one exhibit be a loser Every day that is not packs and all you do is reload to enforce.

69
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:35,375
Rym: Try to be an enforcer.

70
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:35,917
Rym: if you can't.

71
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:38,266
Scott: cool enough be cool enough that they let you be an enforcer.

72
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:40,716
Rym: three submit Panels and lectures.

73
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:44,250
Scott: be cool enough that they accept them granted the the longer we do this.

74
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,883
Rym: There's sort of this if they ever turn us down and they're like no Rym and Scott.

75
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:51,217
Rym: You can't do a lecture this year Fuck that would like.

76
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:54,816
Rym: that would ruin my day at this point Like I couldn't even go.

77
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:56,102
Rym: like I don't have a badge.

78
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:59,457
Rym: unless they let us in to do that They don't let us enforce either.

79
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:02,330
Rym: I know they're like, yeah, we don't need you as enforcer anymore.

80
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,001
Rym: And yeah, we don't need your very popular panels anymore.

81
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:07,385
Rym: You guys are too mean.

82
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:08,648
Rym: Oh too smelly.

83
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:09,230
Rym: some reason.

84
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:11,069
Rym: Oh, I would be so sad.

85
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:14,779
Rym: But yeah, if you wanted badges you can pretty much up.

86
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,070
Rym: There's still some Fridays left and there's still some Sundays left, but there aren't hotels.

87
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:25,710
Rym: But just to reiterate their hotels on the other side of town, ah, they're rapidly selling out.

88
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,726
Scott: I was poking around in this area even the ones over in the good in the.

89
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,193
Rym: you know It's not sold out.

90
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:38,661
Scott: the Midtown Hotel the one that's far away from anime Boston Let alone you can get a hotel like maybe you know on the tee dude.

91
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,650
Rym: The airport hotel was sold out of Thursdays and Sundays.

92
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:55,369
Rym: yeah, but If You need a hotel and you can't get one and you try to complain about this There is literally nothing anyone you could complain to can do about that.

93
00:04:56,152 --> 00:05:01,245
Rym: Like it sucks that it's hard to get hotels find someone wait for someone to cancel and yeah No.

94
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:10,070
Rym: so I have actually I Talked to the hotels and the Westin at length and I have two emails from them from a year ago that I have the numbers.

95
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:10,837
Rym: Not.

96
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:19,390
Rym: as in 2012 95% of the people who booked a room for Pax did not cancel it by the time Pax.

97
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,065
Scott: no No, but there might be someone who's like hey I need someone in my room or they can't it off to someone.

98
00:05:24,085 --> 00:05:28,685
Scott: or you know that wasn't a Cancel at the hotel level but that person may have canceled on.

99
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:39,208
Rym: Pat, you know stuff like that happens But it the people the the less than 5% of people who have a room Cancel it at any point and the hotels do not let you transfer a room to someone else's name.

100
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:39,790
Rym: in most cases.

101
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,318
Scott: No, they don't but how many times do you hear the story?

102
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:45,690
Scott: like all my friends bailed on me so I can't go now.

103
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:47,366
Scott: I hear that story every pack.

104
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:53,170
Rym: Oh, yeah I hear that story too, but a lot of those people don't have a room in the hotel block in the first place.

105
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:59,965
Scott: Maybe but you know what when that story happens That's your one chance and then all the other people who failed to get that one chance.

106
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:00,768
Scott: Well, no chance.

107
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:06,804
Rym: Yep But yeah, this is a convention that's occurring in April next.

108
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:08,008
Scott: we even mentioned this news.

109
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:12,390
Scott: every time it happens I feel like it's gonna be a two time a year news no matter what forever.

110
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:18,653
Rym: Yeah The only reason I mention it is just because it seems like no one remembers everything I said when this happened for Prime and it Sold out super fast guys.

111
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:21,922
Rym: It is a physical impossibility to make this better.

112
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,810
Rym: There is literally nothing that can be done.

113
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,954
Scott: There is something that can be done.

114
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:26,275
Scott: Okay.

115
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:31,010
Rym: Yes, the government could build a gigantic Convention Center and a hotel complex.

116
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:32,523
Scott: There's something else that can be done, huh?

117
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:37,230
Scott: You could have the Pax's simultaneously.

118
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:51,597
Rym: Uh, if they were simultaneous, I think I would go to Pax Prime me too and I Think we would send a DVD to Pax's like I don't think Want our DVD.

119
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:52,821
Rym: they might our DVD be good.

120
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:54,006
Rym: We could do a telepresence.

121
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:56,758
Rym: Oh That would actually be cool would be good.

122
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,220
Scott: They could.

123
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:59,250
Rym: they could alternate every year like one year.

124
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:12,028
Rym: They go to you know, Mike and Jerry actually go to Easton prime back and forth, but they're simultaneous and then they just Simuls cast to both conventions maybe on a delay because of time zones all the big events.

125
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:23,368
Scott: Hmm another thing they could do is Some crazy crazy crazy rich person could just build a hotel Convention Center because you know, they want to yeah But it would be it would lose money.

126
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:25,318
Scott: Yeah, I didn't say that they wouldn't.

127
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,130
Rym: I just said so we need an eccentric crazy rich person.

128
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,030
Scott: Well, you mean crazy isn't enough.

129
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:32,160
Rym: Well, did you mean crazy crazy or crazy rich?

130
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,305
Rym: as in he is crazy rich.

131
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:36,818
Rym: because if you say crazy rich He's just really rich crazy crazy.

132
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,008
Rym: I'm a crazy rich crazy comma rich person.

133
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:46,210
Rym: Okay Yeah, but if he's just rich he might not be able to make her crazy and also mega rich person.

134
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:52,070
Rym: The the plan for that convention mega rich crazy person in flushing was something like 14 billion dollars.

135
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:54,440
Rym: So you'd have to be pretty fucking rich.

136
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:55,363
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

137
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:56,890
Rym: So maybe crazy fucking rich.

138
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,703
Rym: No, because that still doesn't imply crazy comma mega rich crazy person.

139
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:02,124
Rym: Yes.

140
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:03,388
Rym: Yes that works.

141
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:08,223
Rym: Okay So in the news, you guys might remember Ayumi Hamasaki.

142
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:16,426
Rym: I was a huge fan of her J-pop stylings in the early 2000s as well as I as I still am.

143
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:18,732
Rym: I am also still a fan of Hamasaki.

144
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:20,796
Scott: she has an album called I am.

145
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,860
Scott: yeah, that's what I'd say I am

146
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:44,130
Rym: It just ever mind, you know There's a news about her and it kind of took me back to that era because when I got into anime When in when I was in you know, I was fourth grade I was a young kid and then later I found Japanese music once MP3s existed and I downloaded some music from Megumi and I was a big fan of Megumi.

147
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:50,669
Rym: But then I found out that there were more j-pop people than her because she was the only person Americans knew about back then.

148
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:58,370
Rym: Like even hardcore anime fans would be hard-pressed to name anyone who was a j-pop idol other than Megumi Hashibara.

149
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:02,196
Rym: And then Ayumi kind of got popular right when MP3 stuff.

150
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,970
Rym: yeah to mix but that there's two vitals.

151
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:08,777
Rym: and Anyway, there were they really j-pop?

152
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:09,399
Rym: are they more?

153
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,124
Rym: I don't know.

154
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,167
Scott: It's Japanese.

155
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:13,973
Scott: Genaro J-tech No, whatever.

156
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:20,590
Rym: regardless Ayumi Hamasaki is singing the opening to an anime and she hasn't done this in over a decade.

157
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:26,006
Rym: hmm and The anime happens to be Buddha - I didn't even see Buddha one.

158
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:26,910
Rym: I did not either.

159
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:29,100
Scott: I recommend reading the manga Buddha.

160
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,790
Rym: It's probably one of the best mangas there is Yes, and the anime looks pretty good too at some point.

161
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:45,182
Scott: Well when the maybe after the second I'd probably if I had to rank all-time best mangas, it would probably be Best or favorite Phoenix Akira then Buddha.

162
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:46,687
Scott: so third best manga ever.

163
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:47,689
Scott: What about wounded man?

164
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:54,270
Scott: In the top part it's on the bottom.

165
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:02,250
Rym: So Yeah, Buddha movie - is coming Tezuka's Buddha, so it's got all the Buddha and all the Tezuka.

166
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:13,690
Scott: How much Tezuka made it to the movie because they removed a lot of the Tezuka from the Phoenix anime that they did which the Read away made the anime work better, but it means that now they're basically two separate works.

167
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,135
Rym: Then you need to consume both of them.

168
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:17,523
Scott: Yeah, if you want the wacky Tezuka shit.

169
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,430
Rym: Yeah, I enjoy the wacky Tezuka shit.

170
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,718
Rym: It has its place in Buddha.

171
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,490
Scott: It's a little bit out of it's crazy anyway.

172
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:29,260
Scott: So news this is sort of a really narrow news, but People out there.

173
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:37,490
Scott: They may be reading the webcomics Right and one webcomic that we have been reading for a long ass fucking time is anime news Nina.

174
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:49,990
Scott: yep, we've we've talked at length about why we like anime news Nina, and it's on the anime news network website and Today they posted the penultimate strip of anime news Nina ever.

175
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:57,170
Rym: This is the second time I've been surprised by something like that ending without me paying attention and not realizing it was ending.

176
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:59,561
Rym: But it's all politics that podcast.

177
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:00,746
Rym: I really like one day.

178
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:01,530
Rym: I just listen to an episode.

179
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,084
Rym: They're like yeah, it's the last episode at the end of the show.

180
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:06,815
Rym: and then like the credits rolled I just thought it was a joke.

181
00:11:07,638 --> 00:11:09,946
Rym: and then the next week like there wasn't another episode.

182
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:12,167
Rym: yeah in the next week There wasn't another episode.

183
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:19,610
Scott: Yeah, so there's gonna be one more anime news Nina, and then there's gonna be zero more anime news Nina's.

184
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:20,481
Scott: It's so sad.

185
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:20,704
Rym: I know.

186
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:24,823
Scott: But yeah, you should read that webcomic.

187
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:26,150
Rym: well now you know that it ends.

188
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,448
Rym: They're just read it all the way through and you know what the read.

189
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:41,688
Rym: the way I would sell anime news Nina to you is thus it Makes fun of anime and anime fans in a way that is hilarious to anime fans, but also offensive to the kinds of anime fans we don't like.

190
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:45,089
Rym: That's the best way I can put it it.

191
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:51,630
Rym: It is it portrays those guys in the way that those guys need to be portrayed.

192
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:53,749
Scott: also hot news elves.

193
00:11:56,894 --> 00:11:58,166
Rym: Is that the main reason you read?

194
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:03,758
Rym: no I am an elf in games.

195
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,623
Rym: I don't like elves.

196
00:12:05,663 --> 00:12:07,970
Scott: in fact everyone get your audio editing software.

197
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:11,704
Rym: Dude, I played I was talking to tar about this at burning con.

198
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:22,623
Rym: if you take all the role-playing games I've played in my entire life all of them every session and add up the hours having played different races in all games I've easily surpassed 70 or 80 percent elf.

199
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:33,113
Rym: Okay, and price 60% fruity elf with a sword and possibly dancing and gold flecked eyes And all that yet.

200
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:34,540
Rym: I play elves is what I do.

201
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:36,510
Scott: You're not a news off them now.

202
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:46,913
Rym: News elves are far more powerful than I ever was but anyway things Of the day.

203
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:54,637
Rym: so there is an amusement park called or hotel and attract the park Wonderland called car.

204
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:55,298
Rym: it's in Germany.

205
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,281
Rym: I guess yes.

206
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:59,570
Rym: It's in Germany, and there's an interesting thing about this nuclear power plant.

207
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:02,253
Rym: It's an amusement park.

208
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:08,950
Rym: This is an old abandoned nuclear power plant that was turned into a family amusement park with rides.

209
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,156
Scott: That's the best thing ever like.

210
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:10,558
Rym: look at this.

211
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,629
Rym: That's just a nuclear power plant straight up.

212
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,230
Rym: Yeah, and there's the park in the background.

213
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:20,870
Rym: They made rides inside of the cooling tower and the entire outside of the cooling tower is a rock climbing course.

214
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:22,776
Scott: And it's all not radioactive anymore.

215
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:23,498
Rym: I'm assuming.

216
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:24,522
Rym: It's not radioactive.

217
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:25,565
Scott: That's the best thing ever.

218
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:27,090
Rym: yeah check out this photo archives.

219
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,059
Scott: It's probably the cheapest as land ever.

220
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:33,661
Scott: cuz probably no one wanted it and some genius Figured out how to build a music park for cheap.

221
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:40,210
Rym: Yes, probably raking it in the 130-foot tall Condensation cooling tower has rock climbing.

222
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:43,420
Scott: Right you're not gonna sweat your brains out.

223
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,967
Rym: Well there would be an updraft.

224
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:50,410
Scott: I guess yeah Yeah, you know what's really awesome is how you notice amusement parks are always built.

225
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,856
Scott: I'm like really cheap.

226
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,590
Scott: weird land like Disney World was built like this fucking swamp that no one wanted.

227
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:59,903
Rym: So should we make Paxton in like some godforsaken place exactly?

228
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:04,661
Rym: ah so maybe I don't want to be like the old Trini Underground rocket bunkers.

229
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:05,645
Scott: those are popular.

230
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:07,436
Rym: those aren't big enough Don't?

231
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:08,430
Scott: they have giant rooms down?

232
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,338
Rym: I'm not big enough.

233
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:15,350
Rym: out next to the silos My mom and stepdad and I were exploring the entrance to one of those that we found out in the desert.

234
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:19,613
Scott: It's like the silos are too tall for a fax, but this I thought this giant control rooms They're not.

235
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,544
Rym: they're not that big and they're all.

236
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:22,450
Rym: the space is kind of echoey.

237
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:24,299
Rym: They're better places.

238
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,337
Scott: I think Detroit You know what it's centrally located.

239
00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:34,529
Rym: yep, they're one of the biggest airports in the world is why do you transportation hotels?

240
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:39,485
Rym: Tons of gigantic convention centers that fucking put it in Cobo Hall.

241
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:45,750
Rym: It's better than be more Yeah, it's a lot better than be more main events Joe Lewis like now that Otakon has left be more.

242
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:48,301
Rym: Who's ever gonna go to Baltimore again?

243
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,689
Rym: Here's a nerd unless they live there.

244
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:50,674
Scott: Oh, who's a nerd?

245
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:54,710
Scott: nobody, but yeah Ravens fans Orioles fans Ravens fans are already there.

246
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:57,019
Rym: I'm just saying they can't get out otherwise they wouldn't be.

247
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,310
Scott: some of them live you know slightly far away from yeah But they're in their craft in the gravity.

248
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:15,726
Rym: The sad part about this article is that part of the reason this plan exists is that Germany's decided to phase out nuclear power Like a lot of countries are doing Reactively, which is just gonna fuck us down the road, but that's a. that's a Monday topic.

249
00:15:15,826 --> 00:15:16,930
Rym: Maybe a Thursday topic.

250
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,848
Rym: I won't ruin your precious anime fan sensibilities by talking about it right now.

251
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:23,020
Scott: Hmm all right anyway.

252
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,649

Scott: So it's almost Halloween the anniversary of GeekNights.

254
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:41,775
Scott: Halloween is what is is a big nerd holiday these days the day of spookiness and So of course in celebration of Halloween you know one of the ghosts came out of wherever ghosts come from early And he wanted people.

255
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:45,005
Scott: he wanted to get his party on so he went to rob the liquor store.

256
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,450
Scott: so check this out.

257
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:47,408
Scott: It's a video.

258
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:54,650
Scott: You know this guy Whoever took this video should go call James Randi because he's gonna win his million dollar prize for supernatural currencies.

259
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:57,723
Scott: There's a ghost robbing his liquor store.

260
00:15:57,743 --> 00:16:00,616
Rym: I Wonder I gotta check right now.

261
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:08,969
Rym: I wonder if anyone's ever made a video of the ghosting prank that people would do at RIT Because if not I know we need to do okay.

262
00:16:09,991 --> 00:16:14,950
Rym: Oh a lot of different kind of ghost a lot of people call have ghosting different things, so I'm gonna explain to you.

263
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:16,068
Rym: Here's my Halloween gift.

264
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,630
Rym: RIT had a particular prank that might just have been a thing and I never saw it happen for happen on my floor once.

265
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,416
Scott: Well your floor was.

266
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:25,068
Rym: my floor was fish be.

267
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:28,770
Rym: Fish be was a special in the crazy place.

268
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,484
Rym: There's a reason I spent most of my time over at Peterson 3.

269
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:33,475
Scott: like that place is infamous And then it's.

270
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:35,666
Scott: I learned later like Oh Rym lives there.

271
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:37,735
Rym: fuck yeah Why do you think I was remembered?

272
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:39,764
Rym: sometimes like you come down to the lounge in Peterson?

273
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:40,829
Rym: I'd already be there.

274
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:47,402
Rym: So I also that roommate who I didn't know his name the whole time I lived there in your room was like the only room.

275
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:53,923
Rym: yeah, because it was me and quiet, dude I literally I lived there was the guy a whole year Set my I would be work playing counter-strike.

276
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:58,810
Rym: and because the room was so small He was sitting next to me looking behind looking in the opposite direction.

277
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:02,568
Rym: I never knew his name never said a word to him other than once.

278
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:09,628
Rym: he told me I think something blew up in your fridge, and that's when I found out that my wine bottle exploded and ruined the carpet, but I digress.

279
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,718
Rym: Ghosting is as such.

280
00:17:12,181 --> 00:17:16,030
Rym: you're in a college dorm Hopefully a dorm other than your dorm floor.

281
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:20,130
Rym: You make a ghost costume by cutting two holes in a sheet and putting it over your head.

282
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:31,920
Rym: You walk onto the floor you walk into someone's open door going You wait for them to kind of laugh.

283
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:40,035
Rym: Then you suddenly knock everything over that you can knock over as fast as possible and then run And they don't know who did it.

284
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:52,812
Rym: because As long as you get away And you will likely get away because they won't think to chase after you quick enough and as soon as you get into a stairwell And there's no camera you ditch that sheet and maybe possible deniability.

285
00:17:53,013 --> 00:18:04,825
Rym: yep, so I'm not saying that you should do this prank That I actually advise you should rob a liquor store because you're gonna need some booze on Halloween for your party.

286
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:06,169
Rym: so yeah, I met a moment.

287
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:09,540
Rym: There's a big change happening to the GeekNights forum.

288
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:10,650
Scott: Oh, that's right.

289
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:11,619
Scott: so big news.

290
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:19,080
Scott: Basically since we've had some forum issues where people couldn't join and there was spam and all these things that are hurting this community.

291
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:29,780
Scott: Now right we decided that we're gonna go and basically pay to have vanilla host our forum for us Which will make the forum way better and have better searching and all the things that people wanted.

292
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:40,146
Scott: The problem is our forum is so popular it's gonna cost us $150 a month which is a lot of monies Even though we have monies.

293
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:42,014
Scott: We don't have that much monies.

294
00:18:42,315 --> 00:18:43,560
Scott: That's a lot of fucking monies.

295
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:46,314
Scott: That's like three times my internet bill.

296
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:58,280
Scott: so one You ungrateful fuckers you're right, so we're gonna probably you know put like a little donate button on the side And maybe give some bonuses to people who give us monies.

297
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,852
Rym: But don't worry because you might recall from our new bonuses not bullshit bonus.

298
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:05,620
Rym: you might remember from our numerous lectures on such topics.

299
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:11,558
Rym: We understand that changing the rules of a community changes the community and are not stupid people.

300
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:13,579
Rym: so trust us also.

301
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,779
Rym: this may Predicate the return of merchandise because I want to recoup some of this money.

302
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:29,982
Rym: But the main reason we have to do this is that you might have noticed We've never had an ad on any YouTube video or GeekNights thing we've ever done other than the ad you block on the side Of the forum.

303
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:33,438
Scott: yep, and so that ad you block on the side of the forum will still be there.

304
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,068
Rym: yes But we're not going to change that.

305
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:44,140
Rym: we're not going to start putting ads on our YouTube videos even though actually Based on the YouTube numbers we get we could get a reasonable amount from that.

306
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,840
Rym: I refuse no and I refuse to put ads in GeekNights.

307
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:52,495
Rym: You don't be ungrateful fuckers and stay tuned for other changes related to this so we can make.

308
00:19:52,576 --> 00:19:56,569
Scott: toss us a dollar instead of giving It to that homeless guy who's just gonna buy booze with it.

309
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:02,420
Rym: should we get someone dressed up like a preacher man and do a Revival at the end of every one of our panels and then pass the collection basket?

310
00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:05,208
Scott: We would not be allowed back at conventions up.

311
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:07,534
Rym: some conventions would not notice or care.

312
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:09,199
Scott: some some some.

313
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:13,097
Rym: I've had some conventions we could charge at the door and no one would notice right.

314
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:16,850
Scott: other Meta things the book club book is Stasi land.

315
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,197
Rym: I have now read six six books.

316
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:21,730
Rym: in the time It's taken Scott to read this book.

317
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:26,663
Scott: I was reading torch bear and Torch bear.

318
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:33,289
Rym: it's gonna be seven when I finish torch bear, and I've been reading Some deep 3ds games.

319
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:35,699
Rym: I'm now in fact an expert on the culture.

320
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:41,299
Rym: Yeah, so oh yeah, and the new luck Lamora book powering through that.

321
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,799
Scott: Also, we'll probably do that book.

322
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,865
Scott: I'll probably do the episode.

323
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:50,090
Scott: if we just say right now that we're gonna do the episode next Thursday No matter what I guess I'll read it enough.

324
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:51,636
Rym: Okay, okay?

325
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:52,600
Rym: It's next Thursday Halloween.

326
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,484
Rym: I don't think we're doing a show.

327
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:54,468
Scott: why not?

328
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:55,713
Rym: because I'm gonna go to a fancy party.

329
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:57,320
Scott: Let me check my calendar.

330
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,103
Scott: It's Halloween.

331
00:20:58,364 --> 00:20:59,550
Scott: It is you want to go.

332
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,554
Rym: I'm going to a fancy party.

333
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:01,699
Rym: I'm gonna do a video game party.

334
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:07,172
Rym: Maybe we'll record a Halloween special ahead of time.

335
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:07,534
Rym: We'll see.

336
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:08,278
Scott: yeah unlikely.

337
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:08,540
Rym: well.

338
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:16,600
Rym: So the next Thursday after Halloween unless I'm in Istanbul or something we'll do Stasi lens to four Thursdays from third tomorrow.

339
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:20,480
Rym: Whatever kids we used to do four shows a week for you.

340
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,780
Scott: You've been way lax on Thursday episodes and Mondays like we are missing them all over the place.

341
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,342
Scott: We might as well.

342
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:27,431
Scott: just why don't we just only do Tuesday's whatever?

343
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:33,696
Rym: I have found that when we do fewer episodes We have more lists more listens early on of the episodes.

344
00:21:33,737 --> 00:21:39,200
Rym: we do do Mmm, but we have more total overall in the long run if we do more episodes.

345
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:51,700
Rym: Also, there's a tumblr that is auto-tweeting occasionally I'm still tweaking the format to get it right But it is a curated collection of interesting and notable old episodes of GeekNights because there are a fucking ton of them.

346
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:54,130
Scott: Someone actually told me they actually use.

347
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,051
Scott: there's a. there's still an RSS feed that puts out a random Episode every day, and they said they still use that.

348
00:21:59,112 --> 00:22:00,036
Rym: where did we make that?

349
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:00,820
Scott: I made it.

350
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:02,587
Rym: I didn't know that existed.

351
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:03,210
Rym: you fucker.

352
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,057
Rym: I'll just use that to populate my tumblr.

353
00:22:05,097 --> 00:22:09,576
Rym: Jesus Christ I thought you but your tumblers curated it is, but I'd rather it be random.

354
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,684
Scott: Yes Completely random.

355
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:12,687
Rym: I got you actually.

356
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:13,429
Rym: maybe I'll make that.

357
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:17,040
Rym: I'll have a random tumblr that doesn't tweet and a curated tumblr.

358
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,316
Rym: You're making too many things because these things are all trivial to make and they're driving traffic.

359
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:23,163
Scott: people like them All right.

360
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:24,146
Scott: anything else to say.

361
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:25,069
Scott: meta wise.

362
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,354
Rym: uh there there is.

363
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:28,180
Scott: at least go to magfest dumbasses.

364
00:22:28,321 --> 00:22:29,834
Rym: Yeah, the Gaylord is here.

365
00:22:29,855 --> 00:22:31,946
Rym: He's sold out Pax.

366
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:33,552
Scott: what the hell are you not going to magfest?

367
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:35,419
Rym: yeah, Jesus half our friends are.

368
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,704
Rym: even You were.

369
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:42,143
Scott: if you wanted to buy Pax East tickets and could not get hotel and or badge Why the?

370
00:22:42,283 --> 00:22:45,333
Scott: and you're not going to magfest which you can easily get hotel and badge?

371
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:46,738
Scott: what the fuck is wrong with you.

372
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,089
Rym: magfest is Better than Pax in a few narrow specific ways in fact.

373
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,473
Scott: I'm gonna tweet right now.

374
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:53,215
Rym: one.

375
00:22:53,315 --> 00:22:53,897
Rym: It's 24/7 hotel con.

376
00:22:55,882 --> 00:23:04,127
Rym: Pax is not 24/7 like that - it has an arcade the literal size of a football field Physical arcade with all free-to-play.

377
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:09,721
Rym: three the tabletop space in the con is 24/7.

378
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:19,908
Rym: Otherwise, it's pretty much worse than Pax and every other way, but those things are better than Pax and also you can actually get badges And also the staff don't enforce a lot.

379
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:26,236
Rym: so a lot of people are really drunk and doing crazy crap and the culture is kind Of weird and it's not like other cons.

380
00:23:26,658 --> 00:23:33,584
Rym: someday They're gonna get sued in my non-professional non-lawyer opinion after something goes down, but I'm just a panelist I don't.

381
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,877
Rym: I'm not a staff so it's super funny.

382
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:37,778
Rym: You should go so many.

383
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:48,920
Scott: many years ago We were in the RIT anime club And they liked to choose things to show based on certain factors and one time was Halloween.

384
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:53,057
Scott: So they wanted to pick something scary or supernatural horror based.

385
00:23:53,218 --> 00:23:58,683
Rym: and now When the when we chose shows when the exact this is before we were - yes but when?

386
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:08,820
Rym: but when I was on the executive board and I saw the process we Pointedly did not show the club what they said they wanted to see because that actually drove away the majority of people.

387
00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:10,806
Rym: So we pointedly

388
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:15,000
Scott: if I remember the thing that drew the most people ever was like Matt cross plus the movie

389
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:27,320
Rym: Yep one of the other biggest showings we ever did was the first four episodes of gravitation because we did a joint promotion with the LGBT acronym clubs on campus and it was crazy huge.

390
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:43,652
Rym: This was not one of our more popular showings No, so what was chosen was a movie that even then in the RIT anime club significantly more hardcore than your average bear Nobody knew what the fuck this movie was and

391
00:24:43,713 --> 00:24:47,960
Scott: all the people who fans of did Which were some of the people right at the time?

392
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:52,040
Scott: Some of the people who ran the anime club were like in the fan sub rings and circles.

393
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:59,120
Scott: Yes and they like to choose the things to show that they fan subbed and then Not distribute those fan subs in any way shape or form it.

394
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,007
Scott: So it was like some of the early.

395
00:25:01,027 --> 00:25:08,440
Scott: they'd like to feel all high and mighty because they would fan sub something show it at The anime club and then you would never be able to see it again and like yeah, aren't we awesome?

396
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,119
Rym: Yep, some of the early marmalade boy fan subs were shown at our club and were not available anywhere else.

397
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,366
Rym: Gatekeepers and then the drama around.

398
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:20,033
Rym: gatekeepers 21, but we've talked about some of that in the past.

399
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:21,858
Rym: So notable line.

400
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:28,962
Rym: the first There is a man in the credits of the fan sub Ken Hashimoto.

401
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:29,605
Rym: the blur.

402
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:33,559
Rym: Ken Hashimoto was a friend of ours at RIT.

403
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:35,125
Scott: He was he was his.

404
00:25:35,145 --> 00:25:36,148
Scott: was he the treasurer.

405
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:38,396
Rym: I don't fucking know where the secretary was.

406
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,018
Rym: the blur.

407
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:40,304
Scott: the blur He is.

408
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:42,435
Scott: the blur is on the internet.

409
00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:43,240
Scott: mega Tokyo.

410
00:25:43,863 --> 00:26:01,822
Rym: He was in mega Tokyo friends with those guys and to this day We know for a fact that he overheard us making this elaborate joke Discussion about mosh mosh revolution and it appeared uncredited in mega Tokyo the next week Mm-hmm,

411
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,720
Scott: and he was sort of friends with what's-his-face

412
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:11,495
Rym: Yep, and there was a. there's a long and some of the stories around him get into his name.

413
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:12,939
Scott: who makes mega Tokyo?

414
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:13,520
Rym: Fred Gallagher?

415
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,987
Scott: Yeah, he was sort of friends with that guy.

416
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,880
Rym: Yep, and there's other dramas around this guy.

417
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,260
Rym: There was there was a fun drama circle around the fan suburbs and this guy and mega Tokyo some stories.

418
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:32,518
Rym: We've told some stories we can't tell ever publicly fun stuff and he's credited for Translating the missing lines.

419
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:39,577
Rym: We were watching the movie again and Scott saw that line and I was like what Really?

420
00:26:41,941 --> 00:26:54,779
Rym: But we this was shown at the RIT anime club and there was always a talk at the beginning of the RIT anime club Explaining what the show is and why they were showing it and it was described as being scary and weird.

421
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:04,474
Scott: Rintaro Which I didn't know who rentaro was back then we met rentaro sort of we did at anime next and no one was there to See him, but us that was the saddest thing in the world.

422
00:27:04,514 --> 00:27:08,200
Rym: sitting in that panel room That was basically empty wall sort of actually saw him by accident.

423
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:10,135
Rym: Yeah, cuz we didn't know he was in the schedule.

424
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:17,316
Rym: we walk into this room Like what's going on in here and it's just rentaro being awesome answering Frank questions and just telling great anecdotes.

425
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,264
Rym: So, uh This movie starts.

426
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:21,368
Scott: Well, I think.

427
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:42,617
Scott: first of all, you gotta realize this is a 50-minute OVA movie So made wet like the late 80s, I think right, I Made in 87. so this is during the time when there was tons of monies for anime Right, and they were making all the sort of weird experimental animes OAV style and whatnot, right?

428
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:43,740
Rym: Yeah, so notable things.

429
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,862
Rym: screenplay director rentaro Madhouse.

430
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:48,626
Scott: Yep.

431
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,460
Rym: So this was a pretty high production value thing.

432
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,400
Scott: The animation of this thing is pretty great for its time If you read reviews of still pretty great.

433
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:04,118
Rym: The interesting thing is that many people say something to the effect of I don't know who this was made for other than Rentaro.

434
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:07,432
Rym: Yeah, it's made for him by him pretty much.

435
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:11,339
Scott: It's one of those sort of artsy thing Like it should be in a museum, right?

436
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:24,278
Scott: You know, it's that kind of anime that kind of thing That would be on sci-fi channel late at night that kind of thing where you watch it late at night and it's all quiet and weird and you sort of fall asleep during it or so touch up.

437
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:33,710
Rym: the Cool thing is that it's rated kind of highly on anime news network with 41 ratings But - there's a news item linked to it.

438
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:42,675
Rym: The news item is a fan-subber update from November 18th 1998. whoa, I was in high anime news network.

439
00:28:42,716 --> 00:28:43,318
Scott: Is that old?

440
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,158
Rym: Yes I'm gonna read an excerpt from this news update.

441
00:28:47,298 --> 00:28:52,517
Rym: quote Two fansubbers this week announced the completions of projects that couldn't be distributed first.

442
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:53,280
Rym: already.

443
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:54,753
Rym: We're learning things about the culture.

444
00:28:54,794 --> 00:28:57,947
Rym: back then Lupin gang announced golf force two

445
00:28:58,508 --> 00:28:59,311
Scott: and three and

446
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:16,857
Rym: three and Lupin the third Castle of Cagliostro But did not but did have the public news report that the group had solved their equipment problems and would therefore be able to complete Dan Cougar and bewitching Nozomi and possibly Zeta Gundam in relatively short order.

447
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:17,980
Scott: and they're just cranking him out.

448
00:29:18,202 --> 00:29:25,260
Rym: Yeah, they managed to find one generation copies of the laser discs of the Lupin the third TV series.

449
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:28,260
Rym: So they're going to resume work on that shortly.

450
00:29:29,822 --> 00:29:34,036
Rym: It then goes on to talk about gen locks and violinist of Hamlin.

451
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:36,393
Rym: I Would be hard-pressed.

452
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,451
Rym: All right, I'm gonna name other anime.

453
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:45,834
Rym: they're listed here high-speed Jessie Cyber formula GPX.

454
00:29:45,855 --> 00:29:49,727
Scott: I know that is Zetsui 1989. never even heard of that.

455
00:29:49,768 --> 00:29:59,807
Rym: take the x-train which yeah blue comet SBT lazer Part of that the Dan Cougar oavs you wrote in samurai troopers Goldfish warning.

456
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:01,293
Scott: never heard of goldfish warning.

457
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:15,735
Rym: Yeah, so, uh That is the era of Take the x-train in American fandom the early late 90s is American fandom Early 90s hardcore American fandom late 80s.

458
00:30:15,975 --> 00:30:17,019
Rym: This anime was made.

459
00:30:19,642 --> 00:30:20,205
Rym: It's on YouTube.

460
00:30:20,326 --> 00:30:20,888
Rym: we're gonna link to it.

461
00:30:20,908 --> 00:30:21,551
Rym: you just watch it.

462
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:23,159
Rym: that's how we watched it again.

463
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:37,800
Scott: so the anime club showed this and I would say that 3/4 of the audience doesn't walk out fuck out in the first five minutes cuz it was just weird and not Exciting and it didn't really have anything to hook you into it at all.

464
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:42,094
Scott: Sort of like watching one of those French movies with the clowns crying and what.

465
00:30:42,114 --> 00:30:45,266
Rym: this is the kind of movie that You either have to be into.

466
00:30:45,286 --> 00:30:48,438
Scott: I watch the whole thing at the time and I still like what.

467
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:56,534
Rym: at the end though I remember feeling sort of, you know, watching people walk out and thinking what the fuck guys, come on It's it's anime and it's weird.

468
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,379
Rym: at least watch it.

469
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,102
Scott: I remember.

470
00:30:58,162 --> 00:31:01,854
Scott: well, I remember feeling at the end like what did I just watch?

471
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:03,278
Rym: I remember feeling at the end.

472
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:06,511
Rym: Oh fuck Yes, it was all worth it for that moment.

473
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,760
Rym: No, the moment at the end makes it worth it.

474
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,416
Rym: Also, this is really an anime for someone as if you're.

475
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:19,400
Rym: if I'm talking to anime fans This is for you If you're the kind of person who has watched a lot of anime.

476
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:21,285
Rym: You are into anime.

477
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:26,380
Rym: anime is a big part of your life and you want to see something different or something interesting.

478
00:31:26,862 --> 00:31:38,327
Rym: Something odd because I've noticed that anime fans who get really into anime go to one of two directions they either start watching like all of a show like Naruto or one piece like.

479
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:51,860
Rym: they'll just watch these ridiculously long kind of bad shows forever or They'll seek out increasingly Strange and off the off the beaten path anime just to find something different from what they've seen before.

480
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,432
Scott: That's what this is.

481
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:53,282
Scott: That is

482
00:31:53,323 --> 00:32:10,813
Rym: exactly what this is and the people who stayed to the end are Mostly the kinds of people who like the kinds of anime that I like Even though this is not necessarily something that I like but I watching it again now it having been More than a decade since the last time I saw it.

483
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:11,234
Rym: Mm-hmm.

484
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,820
Rym: I Remembered more about it that I thought I remember - and I actually kind of liked it.

485
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,200
Rym: And I think I like it more now than I liked it back then.

486
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,569
Scott: I do like it more now than back then I wouldn't?

487
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:25,540
Scott: it's not like my favorite or I don't care about it.

488
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,396
Scott: I don't actively like want to watch it, but it's like it was not offensive to me.

489
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,336
Scott: It was like, okay Yeah, it's a weird dark anime.

490
00:32:33,376 --> 00:32:46,918
Rym: All right Well, I guess what I like about it is that one it gives you that experience of the super slow Oshii movie that goes nowhere, but you don't like that in the Galactic Railroad, even though it's pretty much the same damn thing.

491
00:32:46,938 --> 00:32:57,878
Rym: I Do not like the Galactic Railroad, but I do like sky crawlers same thing Also, which is similarly ponderous and I could talk about why but but this is only 50 minutes.

492
00:32:58,098 --> 00:33:00,560
Scott: this move They managed to make it feel goddamn long.

493
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,910
Scott: This would be only 50 less than an hour.

494
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:07,160
Rym: if you want to experience one of those super long atmospheric movies that you always fall asleep during.

495
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:09,387
Rym: You can get that experience in 50 minutes.

496
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:10,149
Rym: by watching this.

497
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:16,109
Rym: you'll get the experience of the two-hour interminable movie But you won't have to spend a full two hours.

498
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:17,216
Scott: All right, so what the hell is it about?

499
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:17,900
Scott: you have this guy?

500
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,626
Scott: I don't remember his goddamn name.

501
00:33:19,646 --> 00:33:22,840
Rym: a guy who's into trains finally comes of his own.

502
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:34,040
Scott: Well, he's not that in the trains He just sort of works for a guy who's into trains and that guy he works for is like trying to sell the railroad company Like a new ad campaign and the ad campaign revolves around this one particular train.

503
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:36,730
Scott: It's really old and like the Emperor wrote in at once.

504
00:33:37,252 --> 00:33:45,520
Scott: Well, it turns out that one particular train is Sort of rusting away in a warehouse unused and is probably gonna be scheduled to be dismantled.

505
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:48,695
Scott: So this guy he just works for this other train guy.

506
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:49,359
Scott: He's just do you know?

507
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,705
Rym: Taku he's not a weirdo.

508
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:57,449
Scott: He's just like a normal boring salaryman kind of means, you know He's got a little bit of punk kind of attitude.

509
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:57,972
Rym: You know what?

510
00:33:58,032 --> 00:33:59,197
Rym: He's loaded in he's got.

511
00:33:59,237 --> 00:33:59,920
Rym: he's got some personal.

512
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:06,899
Rym: I'm not saying he's boring as a character But he is definitely not the kind of character you see in a lot of modern anime.

513
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:13,960
Scott: No So, you know me just living his life doing whatever and then that train disappears.

514
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:25,393
Scott: and then that train starts driving around town in the form of a ghost train made of electricity and It passes by this guy while he's on the subway platform and he's like what the fuck.

515
00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:26,398
Scott: and so is everyone else.

516
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:27,522
Scott: cuz just everyone Sees it.

517
00:34:27,862 --> 00:34:28,627
Scott: it's on the news.

518
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:29,952
Scott: Everyone's looking for it.

519
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:31,699
Scott: There's no mystery whatsoever.

520
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:36,288
Scott: It's like yep, that train car disappeared and there's a ghost train Now.

521
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:47,657
Rym: I'm a big fan of ghost trains Now from this point the movie gets increasingly weird Yep, and the government gets involved and this guy is probably psychic.

522
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:54,917
Rym: Oh, by the way When I asked you guys what my Twitter avatar was dressed up as and nobody knew take the Rym train.

523
00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:56,884
Rym: Yes, that's that's the guy That's the main character.

524
00:34:56,924 --> 00:34:57,547
Rym: That's mine.

525
00:34:57,748 --> 00:34:59,074
Rym: That's my Twitter costume this year.

526
00:34:59,094 --> 00:35:04,088
Rym: Okay, so Don't want to really spoil much because there's not.

527
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:06,173
Rym: you've got to experience this movie.

528
00:35:06,214 --> 00:35:08,219
Rym: telling you what happens beyond this does not help.

529
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:12,718
Rym: What I will say is that I think the whole movie is worth it.

530
00:35:13,381 --> 00:35:18,600
Rym: One because you can say you've seen it and you can recommend it to people and two for the final scene.

531
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:20,373
Scott: Mostly, I think it's worth it.

532
00:35:20,393 --> 00:35:25,379
Scott: just for the animation There's not too many things animated in this way with this level of quality.

533
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:29,240
Rym: All of them like a lot of scenes remind me of Akira.

534
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:38,820
Rym: Yeah the character designs are cool too because the characters are all Really unique and really different and really especially the government guy with a weird mustache.

535
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:47,872
Rym: And I love the character designs in this movie because there's so every character stands out as being so different Even that baby that is on the train tracks.

536
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:51,429
Scott: Yeah Almost gets hit by the ghost train.

537
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,616
Scott: Yep, and then it doesn't.

538
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:55,248
Rym: and But the movie all leads up to.

539
00:35:55,529 --> 00:36:08,647
Rym: there's a moment at the end where a character says the phrase Alright, and I remember the few people who remained in the screening at the RIT anime screening Yelled and cheered when that happened.

540
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:09,911
Rym: because that is not.

541
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:10,593
Scott: I remember that.

542
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:12,860
Scott: I remember you were walking out quietly like in a daze.

543
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:15,709
Rym: Yeah, because the movie keeps going after that a little bit.

544
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,732
Scott: I thought that was the end.

545
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:18,097
Rym: No then there's more.

546
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:19,803
Rym: he says, okay, baby Let's get going.

547
00:36:19,823 --> 00:36:21,230
Rym: Oh, and then there's the skull bit.

548
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:22,295
Scott: and then right?

549
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:22,958
Rym: Yes.

550
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:29,900
Rym: Yep No, and then there's the long credit sequence that everyone always sits through because that's just what you did at anime clubs.

551
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,784
Rym: You sat through credits.

552
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:33,515
Scott: Well, I mean especially after watching a weird one like that.

553
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:34,579
Scott: It's hard to get up.

554
00:36:34,941 --> 00:36:35,779
Scott: It's sort of like whoa.

555
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,140
Rym: Well, I remember when they showed the cowboy bebop marathon when the last episode ended and then the credits rolled.

556
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:49,131
Rym: everyone just sat there silent the credits rolled rolled rolled rolled rolled and then the credits ended and then It just was quiet and everyone just sat there.

557
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,500
Rym: No one would move people slowly.

558
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,471
Rym: And then like a minute later this fanboy broke the silence.

559
00:36:55,491 --> 00:37:01,578
Rym: he was like, well that was pretty good and then everyone was like Everyone wandered away.

560
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:06,830
Rym: this movie is Great at being what it is.

561
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:08,960
Rym: There isn't really other anime like it.

562
00:37:10,382 --> 00:37:17,309
Scott: If you it's one of those situations or a director just gets to do what they want for what they want And usually we say yes, I want that to happen.

563
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:18,554
Rym: But that's what you get when you see.

564
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:20,280
Rym: Oh, she's live-action movies, right?

565
00:37:20,582 --> 00:37:22,618
Rym: You don't always want what you wish for?

566
00:37:22,718 --> 00:37:29,075
Rym: no but at least with this it's short enough to where it is not worth watching.

567
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:34,360
Rym: if you don't want to see weird stuff and Not weird like kill la kill but weird like sad clowns crying.

568
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:50,560
Rym: but if you are if you call yourself an anime fan and you know the names of directors and you Actually care about anime and the history of anime if you know who Fred Schott is people like that You're the kind of person who needs to see this movie.

569
00:37:51,281 --> 00:38:01,125
Scott: I'm sure other people who know about anime are gonna be all who know more than us about anime are gonna be talking about all the history of this thing OVA and all the stuff about it That we don't know.

570
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,313
Rym: Ah, but the you know what.

571
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:03,259
Scott: we don't know that stuff.

572
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:04,383
Scott: that's why we didn't say it.

573
00:38:04,564 --> 00:38:11,966
Rym: the people who know that stuff are not in the modern anime community because the anime news network has Nothing on this movie.

574
00:38:12,488 --> 00:38:17,914
Rym: It just lists the director the creator Production house and nothing else.

575
00:38:18,175 --> 00:38:18,437
Rym: Yeah.

576
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:18,879
Scott: All right.

577
00:38:19,884 --> 00:38:27,213
Scott: Well, there you go a hidden Anime dredged up from the past that you never heard of also a horror anime.

578
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:28,516
Rym: This is horror sort of.

579
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:29,840
Rym: I would say it fits in.

580
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,381
Rym: It's not

581
00:38:30,462 --> 00:38:37,061
Scott: hard the way that you know American movies are hard or the way the ultra gory stuff in Japan is hard But

582
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:46,127
Rym: it is in the genre of horror and there are things that people like to say are horror in the anime world that are Not by any definition, but this.

583
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:54,260
Rym: this is the same genre of horror that is often seen in Modern short horror fiction like if you listen to pseudopod.

584
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:02,484
Rym: Mmm, that is that's the kind of horror it is just like a pseudopod not mainstream horror, but sort of Horror fans.

585
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:04,231
Scott: horror like it is just like a pseudopod.

586
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:04,472
Scott: Yes.

587
00:39:04,893 --> 00:39:12,580
Rym: This is horror for people who are Invested enough in horror fiction to have gotten beyond Jason and Freddy being horror.

588
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:18,200
Rym: Really if you're an anime fan you call yourself an anime fan and you listen to GeekNights.

589
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:29,560
Rym: you should see this movie if you like Naruto in one piece and kill a kill and don't really and like Attack on Titan and Fullmetal Alchemist and you really really hate things like Akira or sky crawler.

590
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,680
Rym: You're not a good person and you probably would hate this movie.
