00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,996
Rym: It's Thursday, June 13th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:13,319
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:14,240
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:18,670
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight on the GeekNights Book Club, The Player of Games.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,208
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,552
Rym: So I guess Reddit liked our anime panel from Anime Boston.

7
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:29,695
Scott: That's really weird.

8
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:31,740
Scott: I don't expect anyone to like any of our shit.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,354
Rym: We'll do a PAX panel for a room with like a thousand people in it.

10
00:00:34,374 --> 00:00:35,379
Rym: It's this giant deal.

11
00:00:36,062 --> 00:00:38,010
Rym: And after PAX, there's not a lot of discussion.

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,480
Rym: It's not like we said anything particularly controversial.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,480
Scott: Yeah, we put all our panels up and people, some people watch them and some people like them.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,767
Rym: But there's no like community, like crazy discussion around them.

15
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:54,520
Rym: No one has like a 300 comment thread on Reddit about our Dungeons and Dragons discussion.

16
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:58,187
Rym: If anything, the discussion is like, "Oh, they made some good points about D&D.

17
00:00:58,207 --> 00:00:59,830
Rym: I have some additional points that I'll

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,030
Rym: make.".

19
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:07,486
Scott: I was surprised.

20
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,379
Scott: I thought that would be mostly that guys, but it's mostly not that guys.

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,668
Rym: I think that is why that video was popular.

22
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:19,759
Rym: Because it was, you know, for you non-anime people, we basically did this thing called "Judge an Anime by its

23
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:20,099
Rym: Cover."

24
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:26,920
Rym: Where we took a bunch of shows and we reviewed them just based on a single picture and a paragraph of summary.

25
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:36,660
Rym: And basically there's a silent majority of anime fans who are kind of sick of the perverted crap and the kind of annoying people who like the perverted crap.

26
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:42,300
Rym: And they overwhelmingly seem to take this video as their rallying cry and banner.

27
00:01:43,162 --> 00:01:48,240
Rym: And meanwhile that that guys took umbrage with the fact that we called pedophilia shows out for being about pedophilia.

28
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,741
Rym: No.

29
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:51,344
Rym: I'm enjoying this.

30
00:01:51,844 --> 00:02:01,860
Rym: So I guess we need to do more provocative anime panels that just piss off fanboys but are generally the consensus of everyone else.

31
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,420
Rym: Could we do the same thing for gaming?

32
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:08,300
Scott: Yeah, let me go off on all the stuff I usually go off on.

33
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,434
Rym: Yeah, but what do we call it to do this?

34
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:11,440
Rym: To bring attention to it?

35
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,720
Scott: Okay, well what are the things I usually go off on when it comes to gaming?

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,342
Rym: Alright, so how about?

37
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:17,910
Rym: our panel will be "Microtransactions are a cancer.

38
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,098
Rym: A literal cancer that kills people in the real

39
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:21,499
Rym: world.".

40
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,863
Scott: That's a little too far.

41
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:25,210
Scott: But I mean, things that I say a lot, right?

42
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,734
Scott: For example, "Walk around and hit things.

43
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:28,058
Scott: Games are bullshit crap.

44
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:28,660
Scott: Why do you like

45
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:28,800
Scott: them?".

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,010
Scott: Two, "You actually just like games for the theme.

47
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,215
Scott: You don't actually like games.

48
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:34,299
Scott: You are not the same as we

49
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:34,480
Scott: are.".

50
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:35,086
Rym: Alright, alright.

51
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:36,400
Rym: So here's what we call that panel.

52
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,246
Rym: "That's not a game.

53
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:39,373
Rym: Semi-colon.

54
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:40,177
Rym: You're not a

55
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:40,539
Rym: gamer.".

56
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,620
Scott: That is the title.

57
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,471
Scott: How about, "Failed to get into Hollywood.

58
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:48,138
Scott: Stay away from game

59
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:48,640
Scott: industry.".

60
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,417
Rym: "Gaming, the bastion of Hollywood

61
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:52,720
Rym: washouts.".

62
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:54,440
Scott: Oh snap.

63
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:54,868
Rym: Burn!

64
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,843
Scott: Boom!

65
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:57,051
Scott: There was the dynamite.

66
00:02:57,936 --> 00:02:58,480
Rym: Dynamite!

67
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,300
Rym: So, we were talking about Kickstarters because Scott found a really cool Kickstarter project.

68
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,597
Rym: And before we talk about the Player of Games, the GeekNights Book Club, it's the lounge.

69
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:08,260
Rym: It's Thursday.

70
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:08,704
Scott: No, it's not.

71
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:09,410
Scott: It's book club.

72
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,519
Scott: Book club and lounge don't mix.

73
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:15,378
Rym: I believe if I was going to have a book club in the physical world, I would have it in a lounge.

74
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,860
Scott: The lounge would be too noisy with music and drinking to have a good book club discussion.

75
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,720
Rym: There are lounges that have nothing but quiet, tasteful piano music in the background.

76
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,638
Scott: That's not a lounge.

77
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:25,898
Rym: Those are lounges.

78
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,607
Scott: No, it's not.

79
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:27,320
Scott: You need a lounge singer.

80
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,350
Rym: That's a different kind of lounge.

81
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,520
Rym: That's like a bar lounge.

82
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,320
Rym: Anyway, I want every lounge, and more importantly, I would be lounging.

83
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,699
Scott: That's not the kind of lounge this is.

84
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,160
Rym: On a Chase lounge.

85
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,636
Scott: This kind of lounge is the kind with the singer in it.

86
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,611
Rym: You're going to sing?

87
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:43,340
Rym: Is that what you're saying?

88
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,399
Scott: No, Richard Cheese is coming in like ten minutes.

89
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:54,020
Rym: But yeah, so we're not going to belabor the point, but we're going to talk a little bit about some Kickstarters because we've Kickstarted a lot of cool stuff.

90
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,459
Scott: I Kickstart way too many things.

91
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,832
Rym: I've only Kickstarted one, two, three, four, five.

92
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:59,240
Rym: Well, you talk about some things you Kickstart.

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,419
Rym: I'm going to count how many I've done.

94
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,328
Scott: Okay, so I'm going to go for the most recent.

95
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,680
Scott: First, I'm going to do the three that are still in progress.

96
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,350
Rym: Like fifteen.

97
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:05,580
Rym: That's it.

98
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:07,980
Scott: I have way too many more than that.

99
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,500
Scott: Okay, so the most recent ones that are in progress still, plus pool, tile by tile.

100
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:20,279
Scott: These people are going to build a pool, a swimming pool, in the East River down near Brooklyn, Brooklyn Bridge area, sort of off the park.

101
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,560
Rym: Now, you might be thinking, and you're probably rightfully.

102
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,380
Rym: So what is this, an experiment to murder children?

103
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:33,640
Scott: Yeah, it's not, to their credit, it's not a pool in the Gowanus Canal, right?

104
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:39,900
Rym: I imagine they sink this thing in the Gowanus Canal, and there isn't enough water through the filter to fill it.

105
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,300
Scott: They're using technology similar to what was used in the Beacon Hudson River pool, right?

106
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,200
Scott: Why do we keep living in places with these river pools?

107
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,060
Scott: But they think it's the first, the first, the world's first water filtering floating pool.

108
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,020
Rym: Now that's bullshit because I know that they put one in the river in Beacon.

109
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,481
Scott: Right.

110
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:07,860
Scott: So I spent, I kickstarted it for 150, which gets me a tile in the pool, one of the white tiles that I can write on it.

111
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,622
Rym: Now there are only two things you could write.

112
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:20,712
Rym: It either has to be "look ye mighty," which is, for those of you who don't know us, been our catchphrase for a decade, plus, or the pool is mightier.

113
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:36,680
Rym: Because anything else I would write would be copyright infringement, trademark infringement, or obscene.

114
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:49,820
Scott: Anyway, so, also I get passes to go to the pool like a week before it opens to everyone else, which means that it likes to be a pleasure to swim in it.

115
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,960
Scott: And after the public is let in and it's full of poop, I will never go back, but they'll see my name there.

116
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,720
Rym: I guess you'll be able to take your GoPro in the water and get a really good picture of the tile.

117
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,616
Scott: I'm going to be doing all kinds of stuff like that when I go, because I think it's a whole, it's not just like a day of going, it's a week of pre-going.

118
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:07,020
Scott: So I go like every day that week.

119
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:15,680
Rym: Now the cool thing, and I'm not sure what they mean by this, is they say it's going to filter the water, so you're swimming in the water, but the pool itself has filtered the water, so it's just water.

120
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,347
Scott: I don't think the water goes straight from the East River into the pool.

121
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:23,200
Scott: I think the only way water from the river gets into the pool is through this machine that cleans it and makes it nice.

122
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,842
Rym: Well, that's what I'm saying.

123
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:27,973
Rym: Well, the one they did in Beacon, what it did is the pool itself was a filter.

124
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,440
Rym: The walls of the pool were the filter.

125
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:33,500
Rym: And they just sink it and water just osmoses in through.

126
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,300
Scott: Yeah, this is some sort of active filtering.

127
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,951
Rym: Well, I'm not sure.

128
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:39,040
Rym: It seems active.

129
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,139
Scott: They have a picture of the filter machine.

130
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:43,119
Rym: No, that is the test tank.

131
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,142
Rym: Oh.

132
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:51,314
Rym: What they're kickstarting to start is funding to build the test pool.

133
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:51,996
Rym: that's 35 feet by 35 feet.

134
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:57,700
Rym: That's going to be sunk in the water to see if it works full scale.

135
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,486
Rym: It's going to sit in the water.

136
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,840
Rym: Water just goes through the filters from the sides and I guess the bottom into the pool.

137
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,440
Scott: This is the thing I want to exist, so that's why I'm giving it money.

138
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:12,280
Rym: Now what I'm curious about is they say that it will actually clean the water in the East River itself.

139
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,831
Scott: Very barely, because it's going to spit out the clean water.

140
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:18,520
Scott: that's excess and it's going to keep dirt in the filter.

141
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,540
Scott: You empty the filter, you're slowly cleaning the East River.

142
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,880
Rym: I'm assuming that's how it's going to work.

143
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,989
Scott: Very small, but you're cleaning at the end.

144
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:26,180
Scott: If you want to really clean it, you have to clean it up top.

145
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:27,980
Scott: You can't clean it at the bottom.

146
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,145
Rym: Well, it depends.

147
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:30,560
Rym: I think the technology is cool.

148
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:36,480
Rym: Imagine if we start building these en masse and just putting them in every shithole of polluted water.

149
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,480
Scott: If they put them all around the river all the way up top, then it would help, but it's not helping down there.

150
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:44,159
Rym: This is just a really cool project and it's finally...

151
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,558
Scott: You know, if you talk for this long about each one...

152
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,000
Rym: We're not going to talk long about the other ones, but it's finally a project that is doing what Kickstarter is ostensibly for.

153
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,080
Rym: Someone wants to do a cool thing that wouldn't happen unless they got funding for it.

154
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,200
Rym: Kickstarting it is to make it happen, not really a pre-order for the thing.

155
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,756
Scott: As opposed to these other things, such as Double Fine's massive chalice.

156
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:05,920
Scott: I think everyone knows about that.

157
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,297
Rym: I funded this awesome belt with really classy buckles that is cut to size and has no holes.

158
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:18,520
Rym: It's got this ratchet mechanism in the back and if anything is up my alley, it's ratchets.

159
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:26,839
Scott: This is already funded, but they're going to make a documentary movie about the Straits Matzah factory in Brooklyn.

160
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:35,135
Rym: The only thing I got in progress is this plume sort of recoil... Basically, you know those snap bracelets from the 90s?

161
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,947
Scott: It's a steel one of those that is sort of a pull-out mudguard and fender for your bikes.

162
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:50,580
Rym: You don't have to have a dorky, annoying fender on your bike, but if it starts raining, you've got a fender for as long as you're biking in the wet.

163
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,620
Rym: I commute a lot of my bikes.

164
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,600
Scott: Limited edition translation of Osamu Tezuka's The Crater.

165
00:08:56,823 --> 00:08:57,570
Rym: And then Shovel Knight.

166
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:58,700
Rym: Oh, I got this cool titanium G2.

167
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,185
Scott: Yeah, Shovel Knight.

168
00:08:59,225 --> 00:08:59,669
Scott: I'm on there.

169
00:08:59,690 --> 00:08:59,770
Scott: Okay.

170
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,000
Rym: Because I don't want to carry keys in my pocket anymore.

171
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:04,139
Scott: Oh, okay.

172
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,700
Rym: And it'll match the belt buckle on that fancy belt I kick-started.

173
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,819
Scott: B9 Kingdom pretty much kick-starting everything they do.

174
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,228
Scott: Penny Arcade.

175
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:13,816
Scott: Yup.

176
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:15,026
Rym: Yup.

177
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,320
Rym: Cobalt's Ate My Baby, of course.

178
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:17,458
Scott: I didn't do that one.

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,082
Scott: Cucumber Quest Book 2.

180
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:21,120
Rym: Oh, I forgot to do that one.

181
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,871
Scott: Torchbearer.

182
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:22,199
Scott: Yup.

183
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:23,770
Scott: The 10-Year Hoodie.

184
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,799
Scott: I'm waiting for that to show up.

185
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,580
Rym: Eh, I'm not a fan of that one.

186
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,238
Scott: I need it for work.

187
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,160
Rym: But really, the one that I got that's important is this U-Arrange Wallet.

188
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,640
Scott: I also got that one.

189
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,829
Rym: The Jimmy wallet is dead.

190
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:35,160
Rym: You can't get it anymore.

191
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,444
Rym: It was the best wallet.

192
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:38,793
Rym: The guy emailed us way back in GeekNights.

193
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:40,440
Rym: We reviewed that wallet.

194
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,175
Rym: And the dude emailed us immediately and was like, "Oh my God, all these people are buying the wallet because of your radio show.

195
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:48,959
Rym: How many Jimmy's do you want for

196
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:49,220
Rym: free?".

197
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:50,150
Scott: And I was like, "Zero.

198
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:50,757
Scott: I already bought

199
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:50,940
Scott: some.".

200
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:52,515
Rym: I was like, "Yeah, we all already own a

201
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:52,798
Rym: Jimmy.".

202
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:55,679
Scott: I should have taken up that offer because now, not enough Jimmy's.

203
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:56,622
Rym: Yeah.

204
00:09:56,944 --> 00:10:00,820
Rym: So, what's funny is, no one has a solution for the wallet.

205
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,647
Scott: There's so many wallets in Kickstarter.

206
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:03,552
Scott: None of them are perfect.

207
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:05,100
Scott: This was the least bad.

208
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,202
Rym: It's the best one.

209
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:15,720
Rym: The only fault I see with it is that it is not butt-sweat-proof like the plastic one is, which is the primary benefit of the Jimmy wallet.

210
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,920
Rym: It is butt-sweat-proof because leather wallets start to smell like a butt the longer you own them.

211
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,182
Rym: Yep.

212
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:30,799
Scott: And the last thing I just want to mention is, I kickstarted this, I think it's done, is the Neo Lucida, a portable camera Lucida for the 21st century.

213
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,340
Rym: That is such a hipster Kickstarter.

214
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,163
Scott: Hold on.

215
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,939
Scott: Do you know what a camera obscura is?

216
00:10:36,283 --> 00:10:36,475
Rym: Yes.

217
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,082
Scott: Yes.

218
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,680
Scott: So, what's a camera Lucida?

219
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,799
Rym: Isn't that the one where it makes the outline and then you draw on it?

220
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:48,240
Scott: So, this is basically a prism and you put the prism on a stick above your paper and you put your paper on the table.

221
00:10:48,880 --> 00:11:00,780
Scott: You look, you aim the prism at like an object and then if you look down at your paper, you see, you know, literally that object on the paper and then you can draw whatever the object is.

222
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,060
Scott: So, you like aim it at a person's face and then suddenly you look at your piece of paper and there's their face.

223
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,148
Scott: It's, you know, it's like the light bouncing off their...

224
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,660
Rym: Instead of a piece of paper or a camera.

225
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,339
Scott: It's a little faint, but yeah, you can do that.

226
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,180
Rym: You're missing my point.

227
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:19,758
Scott: But it is, right?

228
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:29,300
Scott: But the point is that you draw, you have a pencil and a paper and you can draw while there's basically a picture of someone's face on there, but you draw right on it.

229
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,320
Scott: You don't need like a light box or tracing paper, any bullshit like that.

230
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,900
Rym: That's a cool thing.

231
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:38,220
Scott: Yeah, so it actually, it comes with, I've got it for only $47.

232
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,279
Scott: It actually, I get a full one that I can use and actually two extra prisms so I can make my own.

233
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:45,399
Scott: So we can have three.

234
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:46,117
Scott: All right.

235
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:48,239
Rym: But yeah, I'll just link to them if you want to see what we're...

236
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,800
Scott: It's the only way I'm ever going to be able to draw anything nice in my life.

237
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,960
Rym: One time I used tracing paper to trace this really good picture of a fighter jet and then I kind of penciled it in with some shading.

238
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:05,220
Scott: I also have the idea to basically aim it at a piece of paper and the piece of paper is on a Wacom tablet and then I can digitally draw someone or thing.

239
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,140
Rym: Ah, so you're going to get a Wacom tablet?

240
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:13,140
Scott: After I saw that video of that guy, he wasn't using it to draw, he was using it to, you know, touch up photos.

241
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,900
Rym: You know, you could bug out with it because she's got her old Wacom and it's pretty good, but she's thinking about upgrading.

242
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:18,618
Scott: That one's way big.

243
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:19,153
Scott: Yeah.

244
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:20,338
Scott: I need a way small one.

245
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,639
Rym: Why not just get the big one?

246
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,260
Scott: How am I going to carry that anywhere?

247
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,480
Rym: Oh, you're going to carry it around with you?

248
00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:27,219
Scott: What would be, I mean, come on.

249
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:30,019
Scott: What's the point of something that can't move?

250
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,179
Rym: So things of the day.

251
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:41,839
Rym: This is exactly what Tumblr is like.

252
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:43,058
Scott: Okay.

253
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,919
Rym: That's all I got to say about this.

254
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:45,709
Scott: That's it?

255
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,200
Rym: This is, we were driven, the only thing funnier than this was something I'm not going to link to from our previous YouTubings.

256
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:53,340
Scott: Okay.

257
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:57,740
Scott: So I think I might have done this as a thing of the day a long time ago, I'm not sure.

258
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:05,240
Scott: But it's something new is, you know, combination remixes of Beastie Boys and Beatles.

259
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:05,860
Scott: Right?

260
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,799
Scott: So the first album was Let It Beast.

261
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:10,280
Scott: The second album was The Beastles.

262
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,280
Rym: I know we've talked about it, but again, I don't know if you use it.

263
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,880
Scott: There is now a brand new third album, Ill Submarine.

264
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:18,462
Scott: Oh.

265
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:21,139
Scott: 20 tracks, all new.

266
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:26,100
Scott: You can download all three albums on this link I'm giving you right here.

267
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:31,460
Scott: These are going to be filling my iPod and probably getting rotated for a week or two.

268
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,275
Rym: I'm checking that.

269
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,959
Rym: Even though I, because I'm finally.

270
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,479
Scott: Ill Submarine, come on.

271
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,400
Rym: I'm finally almost over my Chrono Jigga.

272
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,720
Rym: I'm not constantly listening to it.

273
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,640
Scott: You're not over, you're still Chrono Jigga-ing?

274
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,640
Rym: Well, like I said, I'm just moving beyond the Chrono Jigga.

275
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:47,058
Scott: I should go back to Chrono Jigga.

276
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,533
Scott: I know.

277
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:51,620
Rym: But no, I've gone back into Russian music for a while.

278
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:54,720
Scott: I've gone back to my summer K-pop.

279
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:55,940
Rym: Well, after that to everyday.

280
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,718
Scott: Everyday I'm drinking.

281
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,160
Rym: Everyday I'm drinking.

282
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,800
Scott: It's summertime, so I got all the energetic music.

283
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:10,000
Rym: I'm noticing some people we know getting into or getting back into Super Eurobeat just on Twitter.

284
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:10,779
Scott: That's always good.

285
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,220
Rym: And that is, I think, going to get me back into Super Eurobeat.

286
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:17,600
Rym: I forgot how much I like Super Eurobeat.

287
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:18,518
Scott: It's the best.

288
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:21,780
Rym: So yeah, Metamoment, the Book Club book.

289
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,576
Rym: We're doing it right now.

290
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:31,760
Rym: I have not chosen the next one yet because there is something I did want to choose, but Scott will be really mad if I choose it.

291
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,440
Scott: If you choose that, I've got a legitimate argument for why you can't choose that as opposed to just it's bullshit.

292
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,660
Rym: Oh, because it's obscure?

293
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,739
Scott: Because no one can fucking get it.

294
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:45,520
Rym: So, I'm going to look into how easy it might be to pirate it.

295
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:47,859
Scott: I'm searching for it on Amazon right now.

296
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:49,319
Rym: Amazon, Pirate Bay.

297
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,419
Scott: It's not too easy to get on Amazon.

298
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:57,900
Scott: You can get volume two.

299
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,571
Scott: But volume one, there's only 14 copies, I think.

300
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,033
Scott: Oh no, here it is.

301
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:10,032
Scott: You can sort of buy it on Amazon for $8.06.

302
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:11,680
Scott: Only three left in stock order soon.

303
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:13,679
Rym: We'll see.

304
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:17,719
Rym: I'm kind of invested in reading this just because of the little art inside of it.

305
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,400
Scott: Yeah, we can go ahead and read it and even review it on GeekNights, but I don't think you can make it a Book Club book.

306
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:26,099
Scott: Oh, actually there's 59 copies, but even that's not enough.

307
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,121
Rym: Is it?

308
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:28,697
Rym: Because these kids don't read the books anyway.

309
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,500
Scott: A lot of those are used shady copies from who knows where.

310
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,688
Scott: They're not from Amazon.

311
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:35,220
Scott: There's only three that are from Amazon.

312
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,040
Rym: I ordered that used shady copy of The Prince of Nothing, and it was fine except that it smelled strongly of lox.

313
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:42,090
Scott: Yeah, you're going to pick a book.

314
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,580
Scott: It should be an in-print book that people can get.

315
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,687
Rym: We're going to be at Connecticut.

316
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:46,640
Rym: We're going to be at PAX Australia.

317
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:47,827
Scott: Really soon.

318
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:48,878
Scott: It's like a month away this year.

319
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,483
Rym: I know.

320
00:15:49,543 --> 00:15:52,000
Rym: We're going to be probably at PAX Dev and PAX Prime.

321
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,900
Scott: Oh, snap.

322
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,558
Rym: And then MAGFest in PAX East.

323
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,823
Rym: And I guess Animate Boston, 2014.

324
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:00,872
Rym: And yeah, check out our internet.

325
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:01,720
Rym: There's lots of it.

326
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,099
Scott: We have a lot of internet to check out, and apparently some people like it.

327
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,704
Rym: Yeah, people have been joining the forum.

328
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:17,920
Rym: Though, if you submitted a submission to join our forum and we rejected you, that means whatever you typed in that field, I was personally not convinced you were not a spam bot.

329
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,488
Scott: Yeah, if you write something like, you know, I want to join the discussion.

330
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,220
Rym: No, that's a spam bot.

331
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,860
Scott: Yeah, you have to write something that convinces us that you're a human being.

332
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,480
Rym: Write like, I don't know, big old dick or something, or Rym and scot or gang.

333
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,280
Scott: Something that there is no chance a spam bot could have written.

334
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:43,805
Scott: For example, like, one guy wrote, "I went and saw your video of your, you know, 'Judge an Anime by its Cover'?

335
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:46,819
Scott: panel on YouTube, and I really liked it, so I wanted to check out your other

336
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,080
Scott: stuff.".

337
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:48,679
Rym: Yeah, probably not a spam bot.

338
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:51,199
Scott: Yeah, I don't think any spam bot in the universe will write that.

339
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:51,713
Rym: Yet.

340
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:52,234
Scott: Yet.

341
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:53,679
Rym: Right now, no.

342
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,528
Scott: One day, AI spams.

343
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,920
Scott: Someone will make an AI that his goal in life is to spam.

344
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:58,960
Rym: Then what?

345
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,560
Rym: I imagine in the culture, there could be spam.

346
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,360
Scott: Maybe.

347
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:05,200
Scott: So, let's talk about the culture.

348
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:06,420
Scott: Alright, so you picked the book.

349
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:14,839
Scott: Right, so this book, I picked this book because, basically, why is my Kindle not turning on?

350
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,299
Scott: There we go.

351
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:24,969
Scott: When you read the description of this book, right, it is the, based on the description alone, the back of the book, paragraph, it is the most GeekNights' book.

352
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:28,060
Scott: a book can possibly be based on the description.

353
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:35,160
Scott: I cannot imagine a book being more GeekNights than this book, right, based on, you know, the bare summary of what happens, right?

354
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:52,360
Scott: There is a society called the culture that is pretty much GeekNights' paradise, and there's a guy in it whose only thing in life is to play games, and he has to go somewhere and play games in this weird other society where gaming, playing this one game, determines who will be emperor.

355
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,780
Rym: So, wait a minute, it's about two equally utopic places for people like us to live.

356
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,699
Scott: Precisely.

357
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:01,460
Scott: And what happens when the two come into conflict?

358
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:14,620
Rym: You know, I've read a lot of books that had utopias or futures, and very few fantasy worlds and science fiction worlds are places I would actually really want to live.

359
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,375
Scott: Yeah, there are many aspects of the culture.

360
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,300
Rym: I mean, Ghost in the Shell, maybe, but you know what, we're on that path anyway.

361
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,760
Scott: Yeah, I know, Ghost in the Shell is too real.

362
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,860
Rym: Yeah, Ghost in the Shell is like, wow, we're doing worse than that in a lot of ways.

363
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:26,718
Scott: Yeah, we are.

364
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:32,220
Rym: Or like, the Prince of Nothing, yeah, don't want to live in the world of the honey of unwashed anuses.

365
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:33,137
Scott: Yeah, no.

366
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,640
Rym: Lord of the Rings, yeah, everything probably smells like poop there too, unless you're elven.

367
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,980
Rym: Yeah, you know what, fantasy worlds, if I get to be an elf, I would rather live in them.

368
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,059
Scott: Okay, sure.

369
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,400
Rym: Granted, the elves always get overrun by some horrible thing and eventually after the rest.

370
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,960
Scott: Fine, Prince of Nothing, if I get to be the No God, I'll live there.

371
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,778
Rym: What do you see?

372
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,420
Scott: I see awesomeness because I'm a fucking tornado.

373
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,700
Rym: How awesome is that?

374
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,840
Rym: Well, no, you are an iron sarcophagus surrounded by a tornado.

375
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,938
Scott: Tornado's part of me too.

376
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,160
Rym: Maybe, we're not sure.

377
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,535
Scott: Dude, I have, either, we're evoking, fine, I have a pet tornado.

378
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:08,680
Scott: Not complaining.

379
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,338
Rym: That's not bad.

380
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,118
Scott: Not complaining.

381
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,077
Rym: Tornado Mon, I choose you.

382
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:11,799
Scott: That's right.

383
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:18,060
Rym: So, we're assuming from this point on that you have read Iain M. Banks' The Player of Games.

384
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,346
Rym: We're going to spoil the ever living.

385
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:22,658
Rym: fuck about it and we're not going to summarize the plot.

386
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,327
Scott: Let me summarize the plot for you.

387
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,639
Scott: Awesomeness happens, followed by awesomeness, followed by more awesomeness.

388
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:33,560
Rym: My immediate impression was that the main character is kind of a dick.

389
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,233
Rym: He reminded me of you.

390
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:44,939
Rym: To be perfectly honest, he reminded me of you in a kind of direct and immediate like, wow, this guy's kind of like Scottway.

391
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:53,619
Rym: Because he's kind of a dick, kind of a loner, really good at games, dedicated his life to games, doesn't like most games.

392
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:57,140
Scott: But I wouldn't cheat.

393
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:10,740
Rym: Yeah, he also wouldn't cheat and he only, he cheated once and even then when he cheated, he didn't cheat fully and his rationale for cheating was actually a really good rationale.

394
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:13,240
Scott: Eh, he's cheated.

395
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:14,679
Scott: I still wouldn't have cheated there.

396
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:15,252
Rym: Yeah.

397
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:15,580
Rym: Right?

398
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,254
Rym: Well, the reason I wouldn't have cheated there is because I wouldn't have trusted that fucking bot because that bot also reminded me of you.

399
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,579
Scott: Right, that was the weirdest thing is like, why?

400
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,274
Scott: What?

401
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:34,620
Scott: Obviously, they set up this drone to be a clearly obvious bad guy and it's like, why does he still hang around with it or even talk to it?

402
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:36,079
Rym: That was very clear.

403
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:45,540
Rym: He kind of liked that bot because Marwin Skell was more of a dick than him and would say the things to other people that he, for whatever reason, wasn't willing to say.

404
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,479
Rym: So he would just sit there and laugh as that bot just pissed everyone else off.

405
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,020
Scott: Yeah, but it also pissed him off too.

406
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:54,259
Scott: He wasn't immune from its attacks.

407
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,540
Rym: Yes, however, he enjoyed the bot messing with other people and he enjoyed pissing off the bot.

408
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,239
Scott: That's also true, yeah.

409
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,619
Rym: But Marwin Skell, I kind of like him.

410
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:10,219
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, once you read the rest of the book, I mean, I kind of like him, but I didn't like him before the rest of the book.

411
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:18,678
Rym: But seriously, I called it that he was the narrator pretty much as soon as he said the word maestro.

412
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:21,180
Rym: Yeah, because he said maestro before.

413
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:28,480
Rym: And then when that interjection where it's like, hey, I'm the narrator at that first interjection, it was like, oh, there's a narrator.

414
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:33,020
Scott: And I was like, that's the freaking robot, obviously, drone, drone, not a robot.

415
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:47,539
Rym: But when he said maestro and in the past, immediately, I was like, all right, that guy is clearly also that other bot, especially because it was foreshadowed elegantly that the other bot was wearing a fake bot around it.

416
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:59,320
Rym: And then it turns out that yo dog, the bot was wearing a bot, wearing a bot, but that Ian M. Banks, I wish I had known about him before he died.

417
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:03,580
Scott: Yeah, but it's not like, you know, we're going to get the same number of books either way.

418
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,560
Scott: So from a selfish perspective, it doesn't matter.

419
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:13,079
Scott: It's just, you know, sad that a, a, we didn't have like a chance to maybe go meet him or email him or anything like that.

420
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:13,288
Scott: Yep.

421
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,610
Scott: I'm sure he was at a convention we could have gone to.

422
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,640
Rym: touches were just elegantly done.

423
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:25,100
Rym: The foreshadowing was, I think, extremely apt and extremely subtle and extremely elegant.

424
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:30,540
Scott: I mean, everything about this book was done so elegantly in a way I didn't expect, but was so pleased with, right?

425
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,960
Scott: Like when he gets to the plan, he's playing all these games.

426
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:33,938
Scott: You don't get this.

427
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,200
Scott: He doesn't like devolve into a boring play by play of any games.

428
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:40,640
Scott: He doesn't like drag you through all this monotony in between.

429
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,460
Scott: He's fast forwarding over boring parts.

430
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,540
Scott: You only get the parts of the story that matter.

431
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:45,180
Scott: Right.

432
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:53,420
Scott: And the way he describes the playing of the games, he really just really, you can get a feel for what's happening in the game, even though he didn't bother to make up any rules of the game.

433
00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:01,180
Rym: He clearly took a full page from CS Forrester because he was like, he was like the progenitor of that style of writing about a thing.

434
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,320
Rym: You'll read a whole chapter and you'll feel like, you know exactly what happened.

435
00:23:06,722 --> 00:23:10,280
Rym: But if someone asked you, you would be hard pressed to say anything that happened.

436
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:15,500
Scott: And I love how all the really great ideas he puts all over in the book, right?

437
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:21,240
Scott: I mean, he already had these culture, the ideas of the culture society from the previous book, you know, but it still counts.

438
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,559
Scott: He still came up with the great ideas, but there are other things that are introduced in here.

439
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:36,660
Scott: Like he talks about how like the triple sexed, you know, the three different genders and how they interplay in the society and how like the game has biotics in it.

440
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:54,800
Rym: So there's like biological physical pieces you play with in the game that you have to control specifically did serve one purpose to really drive home how complex and important to that culture that game is that they would devote that level of integration into a game.

441
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,150
Scott: Yep.

442
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:06,719
Scott: But it's like just all throughout the book, this stuff like that, like, you know, just like the ideas of things to put into this world are things I wouldn't even come up with if an RPG was egging me on to come up with them.

443
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:07,320
Scott: Right.

444
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,240
Rym: Well, like it was such a tiny example.

445
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,300
Rym: The ship names and the names of people are the best.

446
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:13,980
Scott: Yeah.

447
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,780
Scott: It's just everything is just so crazy.

448
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,275
Scott: It's like he maximized the creativity.

449
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:19,160
Rym: friends that are ships.

450
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,318
Rym: I like how ships are just people.

451
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:20,799
Rym: Yeah.

452
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,200
Rym: You're sentient.

453
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:21,739
Rym: You're a person.

454
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,540
Rym: But shotless is two friends are just read the instructions.

455
00:24:26,223 --> 00:24:27,778
Rym: And of course, I still love you.

456
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:28,540
Scott: Mm hmm.

457
00:24:28,983 --> 00:24:30,700
Rym: And then there's the other ship they meet later.

458
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,540
Rym: Kiss my ass and so much for subtlety or you're a ship.

459
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,376
Scott: What would your name be?

460
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,459
Scott: Oh, well, it should be your culture ship name.

461
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:42,420
Rym: So well, I need a generator thinking your culture ship name generator.

462
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:49,199
Rym: Well, I've been thinking at length about what my name would be in the culture and I haven't come up with it yet.

463
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:49,513
Scott: No.

464
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,840
Rym: But so I'm hard pressed to say, why do you have one that you're ready to rock on?

465
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,320
Scott: No, no, not at all.

466
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,458
Scott: But my favorite listeners tell us what our culture ship names are.

467
00:24:59,221 --> 00:25:04,419
Rym: Well, I think people have similar names, really, because the different components of their names all mean something.

468
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:10,560
Rym: But notice how in our own real world history, there'll be names of things that mean something.

469
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:14,020
Rym: I like how in this world it's contemporary.

470
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,280
Rym: The names are in the contemporary language.

471
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,300
Rym: So gunboat diplomat.

472
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,861
Scott: Yep.

473
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:21,060
Scott: Well, I mean, think about it.

474
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:29,760
Scott: You know, we have this weird thing in English, at least like someone's name is like something goldsmith or, you know, something, you know, carpenter.

475
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,878
Rym: You can bet your ass that at some point in that.

476
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:36,060
Scott: Yeah, that dude's ancestor was, you know, like someone baker.

477
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,820
Scott: It's like, yeah, your ancestor must have been a baker when you got your first surname.

478
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:41,720
Scott: And now Baker is just a surname.

479
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,560
Scott: People don't even think about the baking aspect.

480
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,679
Scott: It's completely separated in their mind.

481
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,366
Rym: But also it kind of implies that in the culture, parts of your name are given to you based on things you've done.

482
00:25:51,386 --> 00:25:54,184
Scott: And you can make your name whatever you want, because it's a super free society.

483
00:25:54,405 --> 00:26:04,180
Rym: But at the same time, basically hedonism to the man, people might not call you by one of your names if they perceive you differently, because if you're a dick, maybe they just start calling you shameless El Dico.

484
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,727
Scott: What are you gonna do about that?

485
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:07,779
Scott: Nothing, nothing you can do.

486
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,460
Scott: Yeah, I mean, and it's like, yeah, there's no laws.

487
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,680
Scott: You can just kill people if you want to kill someone.

488
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:13,045
Scott: Sure.

489
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:13,451
Scott: Yeah.

490
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,080
Scott: Like the blackmail.

491
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:23,400
Rym: Notice how the only thing he could blackmail him with, like the idea of social failing, the idea of being murdered by that bot basically didn't even enter his mind.

492
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:23,822
Scott: Yeah.

493
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:26,720
Rym: He was just like, I hope he doesn't tell people about this.

494
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:27,384
Rym: But there was.

495
00:26:27,404 --> 00:26:28,130
Rym: it's not like there.

496
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,916
Scott: And it's like, OK, yeah.

497
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Scott: How's he going to prove I did it right?

498
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:38,340
Scott: He tells everyone he could just be lying, nobody, you know, and it's like anyone could manufacture evidence for anything because we have such high technology.

499
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,724
Rym: But then that bit was well done.

500
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:54,172
Rym: But that bit is why I assumed that that little bot was set up purely to be able to send him on this journey and make him do it all along, because so many of the pieces fit way too well,

501
00:26:54,513 --> 00:27:00,280
Scott: especially when the when the bot and when whatever it more in scale, you knew he was like the troublemaker.

502
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:08,021
Rym: He was foreshadowed so heavily to be the troublemaker beginning when he was going to be the troublemaker who follows the guy with him, which is right, but not for the right reason.

503
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:12,160
Scott: But as soon as he disappeared, quotes disappeared and stopped making trouble.

504
00:27:12,842 --> 00:27:15,500
Scott: You know that that was the set up and that the other.

505
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:15,901
Scott: Yes.

506
00:27:15,941 --> 00:27:22,371
Rym: You know, now, at that moment, I didn't think at that exact moment that he was the bot for the rest of the story.

507
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,158
Scott: I thought it could be.

508
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,185
Scott: I didn't.

509
00:27:24,628 --> 00:27:24,990
Scott: I wasn't.

510
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:26,460
Scott: I wouldn't have bet on it at that point.

511
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:28,628
Rym: I thought the contact just fucking killed him.

512
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:29,794
Scott: Could I?

513
00:27:29,854 --> 00:27:30,798
Scott: That was a possibility.

514
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:32,124
Scott: I would have believed at that time.

515
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:39,940
Rym: And I like how when Morag got home at the very end, they had put that bot's body like on a plaque over the fireplace.

516
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:46,245
Rym: Yeah, shotless, I think, has the best sense of humor and it seems like the most pleasant dude to hang out with.

517
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:47,370
Scott: Yeah.

518
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:50,244
Scott: What do you think about the character that's barely in the book?

519
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:52,734
Scott: The Yay character is too awesome.

520
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:55,546
Scott: Yay seems like someone who is way hot and awesome.

521
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:55,967
Scott: Yeah.

522
00:27:56,028 --> 00:27:58,035
Scott: But it's like, what was her purpose?

523
00:27:58,136 --> 00:27:58,939
Scott: Her hymns, right?

524
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:02,900
Scott: Because everyone's gender changing in the culture whenever they want, because it's so awesome.

525
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,559
Scott: What was what was the purpose of that character in the book?

526
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:15,564
Rym: Yay would not have a physical or romantic relationship with Morag, because Morag was not interesting enough.

527
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:16,989
Rym: Morag had a hang up.

528
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:18,474
Rym: He had a problem.

529
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:22,711
Rym: He couldn't interface with people in a genuine way for whatever reason.

530
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:30,842
Rym: You know, all the stuff in the book after he the hero goes on his journey and comes back, he has changed and now they can get together.

531
00:28:30,862 --> 00:28:33,192
Scott: It's a simple part of the story.

532
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:39,220
Scott: One thing I thought was really interesting is that opening scene where it's him and Yay basically playing advanced laser future tag.

533
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:39,762
Scott: Right.

534
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:40,927
Scott: Which I really want to fucking play.

535
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:41,470
Scott: Holy shit.

536
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,387
Scott: And, you know, he was sort of looking down on these physical games.

537
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:45,929
Scott: Right.

538
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,344
Scott: And I was like, hey, you're like that nerd who looks down on sports.

539
00:28:49,364 --> 00:28:51,536
Scott: This is the very beginning of the book here, like page one.

540
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:55,736
Scott: And I'm like, he's a nerd looking down on sports and she she respects sports as games.

541
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:57,223
Scott: I see what's going on here.

542
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:57,786
Scott: Right.

543
00:28:58,067 --> 00:28:59,072
Scott: I'm like the end of the book.

544
00:28:59,313 --> 00:29:00,439
Scott: I read page one already.

545
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:07,394
Scott: And I'm thinking the end of the book, he's going to have to play a sporty game and he's not going to like it, but he's going to pull it off anyway or something.

546
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,324
Rym: Yeah, but no, that's not what happened at all.

547
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:14,848
Rym: When that awesome diplomat who I imagined is being exactly like that elven ambassador in Ogloff.

548
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,278
Scott: Oh, that's exactly who I thought he was the whole time.

549
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:20,813
Scott: We thought the same thing because he is that guy.

550
00:29:20,853 --> 00:29:21,516
Scott: He is that guy.

551
00:29:21,597 --> 00:29:22,099
Rym: I love at the end.

552
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,386
Rym: They're like, yeah, he's not culture.

553
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:24,533
Rym: He's just this guy we know.

554
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:25,016
Rym: Yeah.

555
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:26,162
Rym: He's going to lead the revolution.

556
00:29:26,483 --> 00:29:36,382
Rym: And that made me remember, remember way back when he first gets to his aunt and that girl is just like when like takes him aside and you never see her again because she's dead.

557
00:29:36,422 --> 00:29:36,603
Scott: Yeah.

558
00:29:36,723 --> 00:29:36,964
Rym: Yep.

559
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:37,246
Rym: Yeah.

560
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:38,611
Rym: But it was all a setup.

561
00:29:38,692 --> 00:29:42,005
Rym: Clearly he, this was all a setup to take down these out.

562
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:42,327
Rym: Right now.

563
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:46,203
Scott: This is the thing that gets me so even more excited about the culture, right?

564
00:29:46,223 --> 00:29:51,526
Scott: Because like, yeah, the culture on the face value is an awesome paradise for people like us.

565
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:52,852
Scott: There's basically no laws.

566
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:54,720
Scott: that technology is super advanced.

567
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,531
Scott: Anyone can basically change gender, make anything.

568
00:29:57,551 --> 00:29:58,556
Scott: There's just, there's.

569
00:29:58,576 --> 00:30:01,490
Scott: no, you know, there's abundance of everything like that discussion.

570
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:01,712
Rym: Yes.

571
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:08,970
Rym: But the one is very similar to the star track where the guys like, but what if someone asked for something ridiculous, like their own planet and he's like, yeah, sure.

572
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,094
Rym: We'll give him 10 who cares?

573
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:10,536
Scott: Yeah.

574
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:14,169
Scott: It's, it's very similar to the star Trek society, but perhaps even beyond that.

575
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:14,470
Scott: Right.

576
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:16,597
Scott: But, but right.

577
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:26,910
Scott: It's also Prince of nothing society because the minds that run the show are basically so advanced that they come before everyone else.

578
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:43,352
Scott: So even though they're all living lives of perfect freedom, hedonism, they're not, they're totally under the control of these minds in a perfect brave new world way where it's, you know, it's, it's the paradise of tyranny as opposed to the 1984, you know, uh, evil tyranny.

579
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:45,942
Scott: That's just overbearing and controlling you with fear.

580
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:49,379
Rym: But at the same time, a strong world person can still do whatever they want.

581
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,986
Rym: So they have total effective freedom.

582
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:51,589
Rym: Yes.

583
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,497
Rym: Or at least total perceived agency.

584
00:30:53,517 --> 00:31:06,266
Scott: The minds are so much more advanced than you are that unless you are one of those advanced minds, when I first read, you're not going to be, you know, I first read Hyperion and that was, that was the first sci-fi red.

585
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:07,552
Scott: What's the name of that thing?

586
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:17,305
Rym: And where the super advanced AI, whatever it is, forget the strike that bullshit where the super advanced AI and the humans got along.

587
00:31:17,947 --> 00:31:20,414
Rym: Granted, we know how that turned out here.

588
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:24,691
Rym: Yes, they do get along and they augment each other actually.

589
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:26,339
Rym: And they work to each other's advantage.

590
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,817
Rym: They have different levels of perspective and they basically treat each other as equals.

591
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:37,812
Rym: And I love how the ships all just like talk to each other and they're just totally kind of chill and they just like playing games with the ship and just hanging out.

592
00:31:39,016 --> 00:31:45,120
Scott: It's also, it's a little bit weird though, how they have these drones, which are basically manufactured people, right?

593
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,144
Scott: They're completely sentient.

594
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:51,765
Rym: Notice how they clearly have a sort of non-deterministic guided process for creating them.

595
00:31:52,046 --> 00:31:57,224
Scott: Yes, but they also, each drone that is made has a purpose of like thing is supposed to do.

596
00:31:57,244 --> 00:32:07,206
Scott: And even though they're free willed and sentient, they still do the task that they were built to do as if they were robots and they sort of like to do it and were made to like to do it.

597
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:07,808
Scott: Right.

598
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,086
Scott: So it's like, you know, he's calling up on his, on his, uh, what's it called?

599
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:14,656
Scott: His terminal, like, which I guess is an iPad, right?

600
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:18,511
Scott: Uh, you know, like, Hey, I need, I'm climbing a mountain.

601
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:19,113
Scott: Help me.

602
00:32:19,414 --> 00:32:20,659
Scott: Or I'm falling.

603
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:22,084
Scott: Catch me before I die.

604
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:24,253
Scott: Or Hey, can you come check my house?

605
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:28,590
Rym: But it's implied that a lot of the lower level drones are not that intelligent.

606
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,253
Scott: That's true.

607
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:33,332
Scott: So there are still higher level drones that are saying, okay, I'll do this work for you.

608
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:36,910
Rym: But at the same time they sort of like doing it, but they're all cool, quirky and cool.

609
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:43,758
Rym: Like the, uh, the mind on the, on his, uh, where he lives, it's just like, yo dog, I was totally listening to that.

610
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:44,180
Rym: Sorry.

611
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:46,125
Rym: Uh, so what was that all about?

612
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:46,707
Rym: What's going on?

613
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:47,630
Scott: Yeah.

614
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,037
Rym: We call what's up mind.

615
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:50,118
Rym: Yup.

616
00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:51,302
Scott: How you doing?

617
00:32:51,382 --> 00:32:55,498
Scott: And it really, the book, I wish I had my computer was a mind.

618
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,362
Scott: How awesome would that be?

619
00:32:56,382 --> 00:33:04,232
Rym: The book shows you all these things about this world, but like the prince of nothing, it does not stop and force it on you.

620
00:33:04,372 --> 00:33:11,078
Rym: It just on re it just unravels and reveals it over time by using the words contextually and just letting things go.

621
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:11,741
Scott: You know what it is?

622
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:13,407
Scott: It's the light that came before.

623
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:14,912
Scott: That's what it is, right?

624
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,000
Scott: The light that came before.

625
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:25,788
Rym: So is it just me or was the emperor empire of Azad, not just a thinly veiled allegory to modern day human society.

626
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:29,340
Scott: I think it was an unabashed allegory to modern day society.

627
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:29,721
Scott: Yup.

628
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:31,648
Rym: It was pretty failed.

629
00:33:31,668 --> 00:33:33,034
Scott: There was no veil on that shit.

630
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:33,997
Rym: It is litterable.

631
00:33:34,218 --> 00:33:35,664
Scott: I think there ever was a veil.

632
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,069
Rym: It was tossed on the floor.

633
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,168
Rym: The veil for less apt readers is, Oh, but they have three sexes and they're aliens.

634
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,173
Rym: It's totally different.

635
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:43,822
Rym: And they have this game.

636
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:44,867
Rym: It's totally different.

637
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:45,048
Rym: Yeah.

638
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:45,470
Scott: Okay.

639
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:46,656
Rym: But no, it's just human.

640
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:47,380
Scott: We have a game too.

641
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,362
Scott: You know what the game is called?

642
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:50,106
Scott: Democracy.

643
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:58,552
Rym: I did enjoy that scene where at the end was like, yo dog, I know you're going to go play this game.

644
00:33:58,974 --> 00:34:01,905
Rym: So, uh, I'm going to show you just how fucked up this planet is.

645
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,133
Rym: just so you, uh, don't push out on the end.

646
00:34:04,353 --> 00:34:04,614
Scott: Yep.

647
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:10,516
Rym: And at the same time, it's obvious they were grooming him to win the game.

648
00:34:10,536 --> 00:34:14,916
Rym: And then at the end, they're like, yeah, we want to take that empire down because they're assholes.

649
00:34:14,996 --> 00:34:15,157
Scott: Yeah.

650
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:18,616
Scott: Oh, that's another great idea you put into the book that was just so creative.

651
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,367
Scott: The planet where the fire goes around the planet.

652
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:22,732
Scott: Who comes up with the idea like that?

653
00:34:22,752 --> 00:34:27,049
Rym: Like in Hyperion, the planets with all the different cool, weird things.

654
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:31,531
Scott: But in Hyperion, how many could you come up with if I forced you to sit there and come up with them?

655
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:36,391
Rym: But in Hyperion, those kinds of things go nowhere and I'm disappointed in this.

656
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:37,436
Rym: It was awesome.

657
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:44,827
Scott: Well, you knew as soon as they described the fire planet and tell you what the situation is, you know they're going to get hit by the fire, right?

658
00:34:45,027 --> 00:34:48,965
Scott: That's foreshadowed, but then they actually get hit by it and it's like, Oh yeah.

659
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:49,607
Scott: Yeah.

660
00:34:49,688 --> 00:35:00,673
Rym: But notice how there's, there's one thing I want to bring up about the game itself and how he was bored because games didn't mean anything and he could like playing a game with no stakes doesn't mean anything.

661
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:00,935
Scott: Yeah.

662
00:35:00,955 --> 00:35:06,961
Scott: Well, and also he's probably playing settlers, which he had solved, but then, but he hadn't solved the game that he cheated at.

663
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:08,948
Rym: Oh, whatever.

664
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:09,750
Rym: Possession web.

665
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:10,152
Rym: Yeah.

666
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:10,573
Rym: Yeah.

667
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:18,776
Rym: But anyway, but then he goes to this planet and he's still not playing for any stakes except for recognition.

668
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:23,577
Rym: And he starts suddenly caring about the recognition they didn't care about before for a while.

669
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:29,605
Rym: But then when it gets to the point where they're like, yo, you can keep playing, but we're going to tell everyone in the world you lost.

670
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:32,914
Rym: He's fine with it anyway.

671
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:46,444
Rym: And he's now completely, just like he was before when he was unsatisfied playing the game for nothing, but yet because there are no stakes, he doesn't realize there are any actual stakes involved because no one will ever know.

672
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:52,466
Rym: In fact, at that point, he even knows that the people he's playing with know the deal with the culture.

673
00:35:52,948 --> 00:35:54,232
Rym: So there's nothing happening.

674
00:35:54,653 --> 00:36:01,294
Rym: And yet now he's wholly fulfilled as a person still playing the game for zero stakes.

675
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:11,712
Rym: And the fact that it actually was for the biggest stakes and they didn't tell him that, but yet the only way to get him to play was to show him how fucked up this world is.

676
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:15,065
Rym: So he finally realized he was playing for a personal stake.

677
00:36:15,126 --> 00:36:21,270
Rym: I think he was playing for the personal stake of proving that he is better than these people.

678
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:28,375
Scott: Well, no, it's not only he is better than them as an extension of the culture and his philosophy is better.

679
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:29,820
Scott: It's like we are better than you.

680
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,188
Scott: The way your society is a bad society.

681
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,734
Scott: And he was.

682
00:36:33,754 --> 00:36:36,143
Scott: he wasn't necessarily trying to prove it to them.

683
00:36:36,163 --> 00:36:38,030
Scott: He was proving it to himself.

684
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:38,352
Scott: Yes.

685
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:40,380
Scott: That is what I was getting to himself.

686
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:48,371
Scott: that, yes, the culture I live in, right, the way art, the philosophies and ideals our society stands for and the way it operates are better.

687
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:50,540
Scott: And I am proving it by winning this game.

688
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,761
Scott: And it goes and they go into describing, you know, they don't you don't know the rules of his odds still.

689
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:55,324
Scott: Right.

690
00:36:55,605 --> 00:36:58,235
Scott: But he describes it like, you know, he is playing.

691
00:36:58,255 --> 00:37:11,748
Scott: he's moving his pieces in a in a fashion that matches the way the culture would move those pieces, you know, like the top culture, you know, the way the the way the culture moves and expands throughout the galaxy is how is the same way?

692
00:37:11,788 --> 00:37:18,493
Scott: he's expanding across the board and conquering territory, whereas the emperor is doing the same thing.

693
00:37:18,513 --> 00:37:21,967
Scott: The emperor is trying to prove to himself he knows what the culture is all about.

694
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:26,647
Scott: He is proving to himself that no, except way as odd is is better.

695
00:37:26,908 --> 00:37:29,338
Rym: That is not what the emperor was because he was playing.

696
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:39,235
Rym: He's moving his pieces the way as I know, but he was moving the pieces in that way, because remember how invested in the game to this almost erotic point Marat was?

697
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:44,673
Rym: And then the emperor comes to talk to him and the emperor didn't experience any of that.

698
00:37:44,954 --> 00:37:49,069
Rym: The emperor was literally just playing so the culture wouldn't fuck his shit up.

699
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:55,875
Rym: He was playing as a representation of a Zadian culture solely because that is the culture that birthed him.

700
00:37:56,156 --> 00:37:58,746
Rym: The earth peoples Azad Azad's.

701
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,075
Rym: He was not thinking in those terms.

702
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:05,935
Rym: Only Marat was thinking in those terms because Marat had nothing to win or lose, nothing to gain or lose.

703
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:11,464
Rym: He was playing to prove that he is better because he was the embodiment of the culture and the culture was the embodiment of him.

704
00:38:11,564 --> 00:38:17,289
Scott: And if Marat had known what the stakes were, right, would he have played differently and perhaps failed?

705
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:17,872
Scott: Yes.

706
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:22,750
Scott: Which shows, you know, the coming before of the minds in the way they played him, right?

707
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:31,426
Scott: The minds of the culture are playing a game that is the culture and they are doing the same thing to Marat that Marat was doing to pieces on the Azad board.

708
00:38:31,446 --> 00:38:40,657
Rym: The book at multiple points makes it clear that they don't come perfectly before because they do leave things to chance on several occasions.

709
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:52,770
Rym: Now it's often inconsequential things, but even then they let the Zadian empire be bullshit for 70 years because they tried a bunch of other ways to take down other empires over these millennia and they were like, well, this one's weird.

710
00:38:53,172 --> 00:38:55,828
Rym: Let's hold out until maybe we come up with a weird way to bring it down.

711
00:38:55,848 --> 00:38:56,332
Scott: And that's how, right.

712
00:38:56,352 --> 00:39:00,131
Scott: And that's what I'm saying is that, you know, he was playing Azad.

713
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:01,617
Scott: He's like, oh, make an attack here.

714
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:02,200
Scott: Oh, you know what?

715
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,806
Scott: That's a weird thing.

716
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:04,893
Scott: he's got going on over there.

717
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:08,048
Scott: I'm going to hold out and see how that develops before I make my move on it.

718
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:08,690
Rym: Exactly.

719
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:13,711
Scott: It's like, oh, what's he, you could even think about this in terms of games we play in everyday life.

720
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:17,004
Scott: Like, what is Rym doing over there with that kingdom in T&E?

721
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:21,700
Scott: He's got like two greens, but he's only got his red leader in there.

722
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,701
Scott: No, this is something, the way he describes- I'll wait to see if he builds a monument or something.

723
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:35,266
Rym: The way the book describes playing games is, at least for me, exactly the way I feel when I play games.

724
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:41,084
Rym: That was so accurate to the feelings I have in my mind while I'm playing a game.

725
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:49,400
Rym: And like, Scott, you brought up those situations where I'm watching you do something that I don't understand and I'm trying to figure out, is he stupid or brilliant?

726
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:51,610
Rym: What the hell's going on over there?

727
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:54,947
Scott: Let's talk about some of the other games besides the big one against the emperor.

728
00:39:55,208 --> 00:40:00,012
Scott: How about the one where he played against the guy for like the high stakes of castration, right?

729
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:02,946
Rym: And he was sort of like- I like how they were zero stakes for him.

730
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:07,064
Rym: Yeah, it's sort of like- In fact, the only concern with the culture was don't leave your dick behind.

731
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:07,867
Rym: Yeah.

732
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:09,672
Rym: They might study it.

733
00:40:09,913 --> 00:40:10,134
Rym: Yeah.

734
00:40:10,595 --> 00:40:12,982
Rym: And he's like, whatever, I'll go back.

735
00:40:13,023 --> 00:40:14,429
Rym: I mean, it's not a big deal.

736
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,499
Rym: And then you think he almost considered.

737
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:18,810
Scott: But the thing is he could have left his dick behind.

738
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,820
Scott: We found out later because they already knew.

739
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,753
Rym: Well, no, only the fewest, fewest people knew.

740
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:24,095
Scott: That's true.

741
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:26,609
Scott: But who would have taken the dick if he had left it behind, right?

742
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,400
Rym: One or two tears down, you get the impression.

743
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,222
Scott: Oh, maybe.

744
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:29,644
Scott: Who knows?

745
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:31,149
Scott: Either way, right?

746
00:40:31,872 --> 00:40:35,225
Scott: That was really interesting because at that point, he was so torn.

747
00:40:35,285 --> 00:40:38,899
Scott: He's like, I could beat this guy who's not the worst guy.

748
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,089
Scott: You know, he had good parts and horrible parts.

749
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:49,065
Scott: He enjoyed playing with the guy and the way he described- But the guy was also a horrible person, but he was also good to play with, but he was also a good person.

750
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:51,254
Rym: The way he described his feelings toward that guy.

751
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:55,229
Rym: And I'm going to sound horrible is the way I feel towards certain people.

752
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:58,260
Rym: I play good games with that are not in my inner circle.

753
00:40:58,942 --> 00:40:59,525
Scott: Oh snap.

754
00:40:59,565 --> 00:41:00,208
Scott: It's so true.

755
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:00,309
Scott: Yeah.

756
00:41:00,771 --> 00:41:01,656
Rym: You've had that experience.

757
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:10,972
Rym: You're playing a game with, let's say some guy at a convention or at a game night, or let's say at our wag, who is a perfectly capable player of games.

758
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:11,293
Scott: Yeah.

759
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:17,700
Scott: You can sit down and play a game with them and they will not disturb or upset you, but you know that when they go home, they are an awful human

760
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:20,288
Rym: and again, but while

761
00:41:20,308 --> 00:41:27,036
Scott: they're sitting at that game tail, they are, they were completely personable and they play quickly and well and are a pleasure to have at the game table.

762
00:41:27,076 --> 00:41:37,135
Rym: But it's another point where this book spoke directly to me personally, just because these are the experiences I knew when I read that description, this is the most GeekNights a book could be.

763
00:41:37,256 --> 00:41:40,390
Scott: And it was right, a hundred percent right in that assessment.

764
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:40,872
Rym: I know.

765
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:49,652
Rym: But in terms of the games themselves, I mean, obviously I forget the order of the games, but one of them was basically- against the team with the cleric.

766
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:50,819
Rym: Well, we'll get back to that.

767
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:55,824
Rym: Oh, you're talking about the subsets of his odd or just the games in the beginning of the book where he's just talking on the train.

768
00:41:55,844 --> 00:41:56,326
Scott: He plays.

769
00:41:57,069 --> 00:42:05,642
Rym: one of them is clearly just basically Euchre and they're all just sort of, they're all the kinds of game theory games that we talk about in panels.

770
00:42:05,863 --> 00:42:14,835
Rym: It doesn't matter about the details of them, but then notice how in those games, none of them involve to use a game design term from that Garfield book.

771
00:42:14,895 --> 00:42:16,039
Rym: We, uh, fell eight.

772
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:18,588
Rym: so often he did.

773
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:20,113
Rym: the politicking doesn't exist.

774
00:42:20,213 --> 00:42:26,131
Rym: All the games that the culture likes are the super pure games that we talk about.

775
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:26,311
Scott: Yeah.

776
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:39,440
Scott: But Azad, especially when Azad is that game, when it's one-on-one, but a lot of the rounds of Azad had the multiple players and the politicking came big, especially with that cleric who like came back and he was in and out, right?

777
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,483
Rym: Clerics played with all.

778
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:45,243
Rym: I noticed how he won all the individual games and then all nine players ganged up on him.

779
00:42:45,504 --> 00:42:45,766
Scott: Yup.

780
00:42:45,987 --> 00:42:48,840
Rym: And then the girl talks about how everyone gangs up on the girl.

781
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:58,169
Rym: But in terms of the descriptions of the games themselves, it really came into stark light and they made a really good point at the end.

782
00:42:58,189 --> 00:43:02,851
Rym: And this is something that bothered me the entire book until the end when something was said.

783
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,762
Rym: And then suddenly I realized that they'd strung me along the whole way.

784
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:10,745
Rym: So in the beginning he's playing these game theory games and he's pretty much the greatest gamer.

785
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:12,813
Rym: I mean, there are people who are better than him.

786
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:16,748
Rym: Like there's the chess master, but he's only really good at chess.

787
00:43:17,149 --> 00:43:19,095
Scott: This guy is the games master.

788
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:20,922
Rym: He's good at games at their core.

789
00:43:21,283 --> 00:43:25,980
Rym: But then they're describing Azad and he's having doubts and the game is so complicated.

790
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,766
Rym: The AIs are way better than him.

791
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:29,553
Rym: There's so much going on.

792
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:33,528
Rym: They set it up in this fancy world as being this ridiculously complex magical game.

793
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:43,786
Scott: Like you need a whole room to play this game and with multiple boards and things, you walk around the pieces and I said biological pieces, which I want to make a game of biological pieces.

794
00:43:43,946 --> 00:43:49,504
Rym: At the very end, the robot with him was just like, yeah, we knew you'd win.

795
00:43:49,584 --> 00:43:55,024
Rym: because I mean, all games are just made up of the simpler games and you've played all those simple games.

796
00:43:55,085 --> 00:43:57,534
Rym: So duh, this game isn't actually that hard.

797
00:43:58,317 --> 00:43:58,779
Rym: And it wasn't.

798
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:03,677
Rym: I like how the game actually, no, anyone who's reasonably smart just crushes everybody in that game.

799
00:44:03,697 --> 00:44:08,437
Rym: I mean, he beat all the nubs and he only was challenged by the actually good players.

800
00:44:08,718 --> 00:44:11,128
Scott: There was a little bit of initial D going on in there, right?

801
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:14,823
Scott: Or, you know, general Shonen fighting of like, yeah, he's Kenshiro.

802
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:15,666
Scott: He always wins.

803
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:19,962
Scott: But seriously, this next guy is the emperor who's won like fucking all the time.

804
00:44:20,003 --> 00:44:22,037
Scott: And the only person he didn't beat was the previous emperor.

805
00:44:22,057 --> 00:44:22,862
Rym: Yeah, because they keep setting you up.

806
00:44:22,882 --> 00:44:24,290
Rym: He keeps thinking, am I missing something?

807
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:25,115
Rym: Am I missing something?

808
00:44:25,155 --> 00:44:26,705
Rym: Which we've had that experience.

809
00:44:26,725 --> 00:44:29,441
Rym: You're playing Puerto Rico and suddenly someone's doing something way different.

810
00:44:29,462 --> 00:44:30,849
Rym: You're like, oh, am I missing something?

811
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:31,835
Rym: Am I missing something?

812
00:44:31,855 --> 00:44:33,061
Rym: Then you win by like 30 points.

813
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:34,529
Rym: You're like, no, no, nothing.

814
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:35,534
Scott: I am just better than these.

815
00:44:35,575 --> 00:44:38,289
Scott: But it's like, wow, that emperor must be really fucking good at this game.

816
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:42,087
Rym: I noticed that moment of doubt he had when the emperor is like, I'll have a surprise for you tomorrow.

817
00:44:42,128 --> 00:44:42,690
Rym: He's like, what?

818
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:44,237
Rym: But I won mathematically.

819
00:44:44,257 --> 00:44:45,322
Rym: What surprise?

820
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:46,487
Rym: Is he just stupid?

821
00:44:47,049 --> 00:44:47,912
Rym: Did I miss something?

822
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:51,505
Rym: And then the surprise was, I'm just going to fucking flip the table over and shoot you.

823
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:57,504
Scott: Oh, and by the way, we have shields and our technology, you can't even shoot me.

824
00:44:57,765 --> 00:44:59,331
Scott: We're so over that much better than you.

825
00:44:59,612 --> 00:45:00,797
Scott: You can't even shoot me.

826
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:12,756
Rym: I really enjoyed the disparity in technology being not what happens in our world where the superior technology is just raping and pillaging and destroying everything.

827
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,605
Rym: The superior technology was also the good guys.

828
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:14,907
Scott: Yeah.

829
00:45:14,927 --> 00:45:15,812
Scott: This is very technology.

830
00:45:15,852 --> 00:45:17,239
Scott: And it's, it's so superior.

831
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:19,167
Scott: It's basically just like laughing.

832
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:28,668
Scott: It's not like in the real world where it's like, yeah, we can bomb the hell out of someone who has weak technology, but we get on the ground and yeah, they kill a fuck ton of us with bombs and guns, right?

833
00:45:28,868 --> 00:45:30,053
Scott: This is so laughable.

834
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:34,790
Scott: Like this culture could just walk around without any fear of any harm whatsoever.

835
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,616
Scott: Just mowing everyone down.

836
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:41,391
Scott: Like even more dangerous than like terminators in judgment day.

837
00:45:41,432 --> 00:45:44,161
Rym: He has such a hard time just even experiencing fear.

838
00:45:44,201 --> 00:45:45,385
Rym: He's like, should I be afraid now?

839
00:45:45,486 --> 00:45:48,858
Rym: I wonder if I could die like, Whoa, dying.

840
00:45:48,878 --> 00:45:50,062
Scott: Could that even happen?

841
00:45:51,406 --> 00:45:53,812
Scott: And it's like dudes try to like give him drugs.

842
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:56,500
Scott: And he's like, I'm built in bypassed it.

843
00:45:57,783 --> 00:45:59,348
Scott: I got drugs built in dude.

844
00:46:00,531 --> 00:46:01,734
Scott: I wasted your drugs, man.

845
00:46:01,995 --> 00:46:02,256
Rym: Yep.

846
00:46:02,516 --> 00:46:08,349
Rym: And also how he's so worried about, you know, the culture and this whole thing about, well, he's glanding and maybe that's cheating, but they'll let him use them anyway.

847
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:08,895
Rym: And then he gets there.

848
00:46:08,915 --> 00:46:12,531
Rym: He's like, Oh, everybody's just using drugs, like injecting them.

849
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:13,495
Rym: Awesome.

850
00:46:13,575 --> 00:46:14,860
Scott: It's like, they're all on roids.

851
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,206
Scott: I have a roid factory in my guts.

852
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:19,412
Scott: I don't need to eat roids.

853
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:27,115
Rym: Now, aside from the obvious social commentary that we're going to skip, because you should be smart enough

854
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:30,225
Scott: about gender and poverty and such and such,

855
00:46:30,465 --> 00:46:43,137
Rym: how well it showed that even the gamer utopia, the perfect meritocracy of here is an objective 100% fair game that will perfectly test your skills.

856
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:44,741
Scott: It had politics in it though.

857
00:46:44,922 --> 00:46:45,083
Scott: Right.

858
00:46:45,123 --> 00:46:54,914
Rym: That was the main, but it is a society where politicking should matter in some sense, the game of facade, right?

859
00:46:54,934 --> 00:46:55,395
Rym: As a whole.

860
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:55,897
Rym: Yeah.

861
00:46:56,118 --> 00:47:06,418
Rym: But the fact that the game that you have, you have ostensibly a perfectly fair game that anyone who's smart enough could win, except that Pete, you know, women are, can't even get in the game.

862
00:47:06,438 --> 00:47:07,883
Rym: Well, they can get in the game.

863
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:09,146
Rym: This is the problem.

864
00:47:09,387 --> 00:47:10,851
Rym: No, they can, but here's the problem.

865
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:24,191
Rym: Everyone just that the game, this book does a good job of explaining to libertarian gamer grognards don't understand what privilege means that.

866
00:47:24,231 --> 00:47:26,739
Rym: yes, everyone has a perfectly equal shot.

867
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:30,618
Rym: Even if you remove that politicking because Marat's like, why don't you just remove the politics?

868
00:47:30,658 --> 00:47:34,173
Scott: I guess if that girl was as good at the game as Marat, she got into it.

869
00:47:34,414 --> 00:47:36,101
Scott: She could have fended off nine at once.

870
00:47:36,302 --> 00:47:37,607
Scott: All everyone ganging up on her.

871
00:47:37,908 --> 00:47:38,029
Scott: Or

872
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:43,790
Rym: even then he makes suggestions like maybe you could remove ganging up and still have just the two on the one-on-one,

873
00:47:44,452 --> 00:47:44,713
Scott: but

874
00:47:45,235 --> 00:47:56,516
Rym: it doesn't matter because only the people already in power have access to the schools and the life where they can spend their entire for the, basically their entire life training to play the game.

875
00:47:56,536 --> 00:47:59,791
Rym: The person who's working for a living does not have those advantages.

876
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:00,917
Rym: The game is still unfair.

877
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:04,554
Scott: And this is why, and the thing is this game is odd in particular.

878
00:48:04,574 --> 00:48:08,554
Scott: It was not a game you could just, you know, you needed a whole court to learn how to play it right.

879
00:48:08,574 --> 00:48:10,362
Scott: And all these advanced pieces and things.

880
00:48:10,623 --> 00:48:11,768
Scott: So to even get a set of it.

881
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:15,966
Scott: It's not like chess, even New York City, a homeless guy can play chess in the park, right?

882
00:48:16,006 --> 00:48:17,794
Scott: With basically some sticks and rocks.

883
00:48:17,914 --> 00:48:20,344
Rym: And he has access to all the chess books in the library.

884
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:21,007
Scott: Exactly.

885
00:48:21,368 --> 00:48:28,074
Scott: But in, you know, Azad, it's like if you were a homeless guy in Azad who is, you know, you couldn't even learn the game of Azad.

886
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:30,544
Scott: There was no way to even get pieces or anything.

887
00:48:30,564 --> 00:48:32,452
Scott: You would just watch it on TV like it was.

888
00:48:32,753 --> 00:48:33,335
Scott: It's like us.

889
00:48:33,596 --> 00:48:36,066
Scott: Imagine if the game for America was NFL football.

890
00:48:36,086 --> 00:48:41,329
Scott: It's like, yeah, I can watch it on TV, but I can't learn it from TV because you don't see the full picture on TV.

891
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:43,780
Scott: They don't show you the whole camera, the whole field, right?

892
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,127
Scott: Because that'd be boring, right?

893
00:48:45,348 --> 00:48:46,996
Scott: You don't get to see what the coaches are saying.

894
00:48:47,237 --> 00:48:48,563
Scott: You don't get to go on the field.

895
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:53,885
Scott: You need a ton of equipment and a giant piece of grass and all this referees and stuff to even try to play it.

896
00:48:53,905 --> 00:49:03,120
Scott: There's no way to learn that game unless you are privileged enough to be like, go to high school and get on a team or go to a college and get on a team and so forth.

897
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:03,622
Scott: Right.

898
00:49:03,903 --> 00:49:08,260
Scott: And as, whereas the culture, everyone has all goddamn day to do whatever the hell they want.

899
00:49:08,401 --> 00:49:11,680
Scott: If they want to learn games, they can do that, which is why the culture is the best.

900
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:20,512
Rym: It's the situation of the Azadians by and large are the kind of the typical kind of gamer that doesn't really understand the core components of gaming.

901
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:29,078
Rym: It was kind of clear that when the politicking came up, they didn't really understand what politicking was, but Marat did.

902
00:49:29,098 --> 00:49:30,825
Rym: And that's part of why he was able to win.

903
00:49:30,845 --> 00:49:37,371
Rym: because he understood that that is a factor in multiplayer games because he understood what a game is.

904
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:46,467
Rym: And this whole culture basically didn't in the same sense that the real world, no one I play Puerto Rico with understands the lefty righty and the paper, rock, scissors, and the drafting.

905
00:49:46,507 --> 00:49:48,275
Scott: That's how I played Puerto Rico.

906
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:51,269
Scott: Like Adam, let me have the role I wanted that he should have taken.

907
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:52,556
Scott: And I was pretty much at that.

908
00:49:52,696 --> 00:49:56,677
Scott: As soon as I took that role, I was like, probably going to win because I'm gonna get a factory no matter what now.

909
00:49:56,919 --> 00:49:57,140
Rym: Yep.

910
00:49:57,381 --> 00:50:00,149
Scott: And I got one and I won by a ton of points.

911
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:01,414
Rym: Good game.

912
00:50:01,454 --> 00:50:07,864
Scott: And I sort of shut my mouth, even though you sort of said what was going to happen, but, but I wanted to let it happen so I could win.

913
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:09,132
Scott: But then it made the rest of the game boring.

914
00:50:09,213 --> 00:50:20,579
Rym: You started to lose this before, then we kind of backed off of it, but I really enjoy more than all these personal touches, but on a more generic sense that the culture is willing to just fuck with other cultures.

915
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:22,365
Scott: Well, that's the contact part, right?

916
00:50:22,446 --> 00:50:24,715
Scott: It's sort of like the inside the culture itself.

917
00:50:25,016 --> 00:50:27,726
Scott: How much drama is there really that you could tell a story?

918
00:50:27,766 --> 00:50:40,053
Scott: I love the story he gets when he's back home and they change sex and change back and made babies and had a party and someone got a full web and a few people were killed because there was this crazy accident and whatevs.

919
00:50:40,294 --> 00:50:40,596
Scott: Yeah.

920
00:50:40,616 --> 00:50:41,419
Scott: It's like, no.

921
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:41,620
Scott: Okay.

922
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:41,981
Scott: Nothing.

923
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:50,429
Scott: You know, like, you know, when, uh, the drone is like, you know, threatening him, it's like, that's the most drama you can have here.

924
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:54,525
Rym: is someone being someone you cheated at a board game, right?

925
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:55,770
Scott: It's like inside the culture.

926
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:03,740
Scott: You can't have a story, which is why I think he introduces this contact aspect, which is basically the game the minds are playing with the universe.

927
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,071
Rym: I don't think that's why he introduced that mechanic to.

928
00:51:06,091 --> 00:51:09,184
Scott: the contact is also in the first book, right?

929
00:51:09,265 --> 00:51:13,220
Scott: It's all about, that's what I'm almost done reading the first culture book.

930
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,063
Scott: This is the second one.

931
00:51:14,323 --> 00:51:17,053
Scott: You don't need to read any, any particular order.

932
00:51:17,595 --> 00:51:20,546
Scott: And it's all about the stuff contact is doing.

933
00:51:20,566 --> 00:51:21,410
Scott: Cause that's where the stuff.

934
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:26,629
Scott: you can write an interesting book for the real world that we live in.

935
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,459
Rym: It doesn't have to be because that's how you tell the story.

936
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,857
Rym: Another way to look at it is that look at the star Trek kind of scifi that most people read.

937
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:39,171
Rym: the super advanced benevolent culture always has this non intervention policy.

938
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:52,736
Rym: And a lot of people think that, uh, certain kinds of liberalism or progressivism in real world, current day politics means cultural relativism and letting everyone do what they want out there.

939
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:58,797
Rym: No, but no, the culture has a strong personal sense of morals that it recognizes is arbitrary.

940
00:51:59,098 --> 00:52:03,615
Rym: And nonetheless feels perfectly willing when it sees something abhorrent, just fuck it up.

941
00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:04,639
Rym: Yeah.

942
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:08,614
Scott: Which is the kind of they see some poverty and they're like, that shit is wrong.

943
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,003
Scott: Your culture is an awful culture as odd.

944
00:52:11,365 --> 00:52:14,477
Scott: We are going to work to replace it with the cultures.

945
00:52:14,517 --> 00:52:17,026
Rym: And we're going to try to replace it or at least bring it down.

946
00:52:17,087 --> 00:52:20,962
Rym: So something good can take root in the least horrifying way possible.

947
00:52:20,982 --> 00:52:22,830
Rym: We're going to try to minimize damage.

948
00:52:23,131 --> 00:52:29,764
Scott: I mean, they obviously set up this whole resistance movement ready to go and they're willing to take their sweet ass time because I'm pretty sure those minds are immortal.

949
00:52:29,964 --> 00:52:30,225
Scott: Yeah.

950
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:31,570
Scott: They got.

951
00:52:32,092 --> 00:52:33,115
Rym: chambliss is ancient.

952
00:52:33,175 --> 00:52:34,359
Rym: No one even knows how old he is.

953
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,082
Scott: Right.

954
00:52:35,624 --> 00:52:40,622
Scott: Well, he, she, it, you know, whatever he is in English, because we're not speaking their language.

955
00:52:40,923 --> 00:52:45,197
Rym: He is the technically correct gender, neutral pronoun, whatever it is.

956
00:52:45,498 --> 00:52:46,722
Scott: It's a drone, right?

957
00:52:46,803 --> 00:52:49,012
Scott: It's, it's a sentient electronic being.

958
00:52:49,494 --> 00:52:50,177
Scott: I wish I was one.

959
00:52:50,197 --> 00:52:50,960
Scott: That'd be awesome.

960
00:52:51,821 --> 00:52:53,951
Rym: There was some pretty horrific violence in this book though.

961
00:52:54,594 --> 00:52:58,634
Scott: Well, I mean, you're talking like, you know, mostly castrations and people getting lasered.

962
00:52:58,795 --> 00:53:06,041
Rym: I think the two points that really stood out were when, uh, the drone just unlocks the level three channel and doesn't even describe it.

963
00:53:06,302 --> 00:53:10,800
Rym: He describes level one, level two and level three really leaves it mostly to your imagination.

964
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:23,360
Rym: And I love how he makes that point that Marat just kind of sat there watching it and then watched it a whole lot, but wasn't invested in it in that sexual way that the Azadians were.

965
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,224
Rym: He just watched it.

966
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:25,645
Scott: Yep.

967
00:53:26,448 --> 00:53:45,719
Rym: But also when the vizier is the only way I'm going to describe that guy, Hamlin Jafar, when that guy's, when he's describing like that music might not be that good, but if you know what those instruments are made out of, you'll really appreciate it.

968
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,704
Scott: Oh yeah.

969
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:48,265
Rym: Yeah.

970
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:51,756
Rym: But Marat is, this is why I like the culture.

971
00:53:52,016 --> 00:54:02,208
Rym: He is so horrified, but he's a gamer and he, that whole end section when, when even the drones like, yo dog, you're not, uh, you're not going native.

972
00:54:02,288 --> 00:54:05,781
Rym: Are you like, maybe we should start speaking our real language again.

973
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:09,675
Rym: Cause seriously, but he just is smiling and pleasant.

974
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:20,919
Rym: When the guy says the thing about, you know, the femur extracted from the still living woman and he's like, so I guess they come in pairs and he's shooting at those animals, but he's missing on purpose and he's

975
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:21,200
Scott: just that

976
00:54:22,544 --> 00:54:28,161
Rym: whole end, you get the impression he's just smiling at them and putting up this face in his mind.

977
00:54:28,202 --> 00:54:34,827
Rym: He's thinking you fuckers, I'm going to beat you all your own game and then leave with my two middle fingers held high.

978
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:36,554
Scott: It's sort of what he does.

979
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:38,823
Rym: I'm going to win just to prove that you're all assholes.

980
00:54:39,204 --> 00:54:40,890
Rym: Okay.

981
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:41,873
Rym: I really liked this book.

982
00:54:41,913 --> 00:54:42,575
Rym: What else can I say?

983
00:54:42,596 --> 00:54:42,997
Rym: Yeah.

984
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,547
Scott: Uh, you should read the one that comes before it.

985
00:54:45,587 --> 00:54:45,909
Rym: Yeah.

986
00:54:46,009 --> 00:54:48,460
Rym: Already going to read all the books that Ena Banks wrote.

987
00:54:49,101 --> 00:54:54,546
Scott: So the book, the other book, just to give a preview of it, because obviously consider FLEBLIS consider FLEBLIS.

988
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:59,722
Scott: Basically what it's about is it's from, obviously it's a culture book one.

989
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,774
Scott: So it's still a completely separate story, separate characters.

990
00:55:02,814 --> 00:55:05,486
Scott: There's no connection other than the setting, right?

991
00:55:05,707 --> 00:55:09,846
Scott: So you don't, what order you read these in, I think has no, doesn't matter at all, right?

992
00:55:09,866 --> 00:55:12,337
Scott: It's just how much you already know about the culture, right?

993
00:55:12,578 --> 00:55:13,221
Scott: Going in.

994
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:17,600
Scott: So you assume going into this one, consider FLEBLIS, you know nothing about the culture.

995
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:22,477
Scott: And it's actually told from the perspective of, uh, an alien shape-shifty guy.

996
00:55:22,497 --> 00:55:30,862
Scott: Who's not in the culture is philosophically opposed to it and is working for an alien race that is at war with the culture.

997
00:55:31,223 --> 00:55:37,226
Scott: And it tells you, you know, basically he's on this mission to do something, uh, to basically recover this mind.

998
00:55:37,246 --> 00:55:40,519
Scott: That's that like escaped and is trapped on a planet.

999
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:46,321
Scott: And he's, he's going to try to steal this mind, his culture mind for the aliens that are fighting against the culture.

1000
00:55:46,341 --> 00:55:52,768
Scott: And you learn about the culture from the outside, mostly interacting with, you know, contact and the war parts.

1001
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:53,651
Scott: Right.

1002
00:55:53,932 --> 00:55:57,164
Scott: And there's some culture people he interacts with and this whole thing goes on and on.

1003
00:55:57,184 --> 00:55:57,385
Scott: Right.

1004
00:55:57,907 --> 00:56:01,399
Scott: And it's pretty fascinating coming down to that.

1005
00:56:01,419 --> 00:56:10,296
Scott: You introduced everyone to the culture from the outside, as opposed to from the inside, like we got by reading books too first, but totally different.

1006
00:56:10,336 --> 00:56:11,179
Scott: look at it that way.

1007
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:17,165
Rym: But I think in both of these books, the implied argument that the culture is superior is not hammered over your head.

1008
00:56:17,305 --> 00:56:19,856
Rym: It's just demonstrated by the course of events.

1009
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:20,118
Scott: Yeah.

1010
00:56:20,178 --> 00:56:25,454
Scott: And I think the other thing is it's really nice to read something that's utopian.

1011
00:56:25,514 --> 00:56:27,079
Scott: That's actually utopian.

1012
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,927
Scott: It's not like all the cultures of dystopia.

1013
00:56:28,967 --> 00:56:37,984
Scott: The only dystopia of the culture that is shown in player of games is you may not have free will because the minds come before you, but that is no different from the real universe.

1014
00:56:38,064 --> 00:56:39,328
Scott: If physics comes before you.

1015
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:39,790
Scott: Yup.

1016
00:56:40,071 --> 00:56:42,840
Rym: So what's the worst thing that happened?

1017
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,807
Rym: I mean, people die, but that's just reality.

1018
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:51,929
Scott: Culture is only a dystopia for conservative people or more at was slightly bored.

1019
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:52,772
Scott: Yeah.

1020
00:56:53,554 --> 00:56:55,920
Scott: It could be a dystopia in that way, but not for me.

1021
00:56:57,121 --> 00:56:57,783
Scott: Not for me.

1022
00:56:57,883 --> 00:56:58,546
Scott: Jesus Christ.

1023
00:56:58,566 --> 00:56:58,706
Scott: Yeah.

1024
00:56:58,726 --> 00:56:59,288
Rym: So I'll say this.

1025
00:56:59,388 --> 00:57:10,250
Rym: I would have very, I feel like I would not be friends with anyone or probably I'm not friends with anyone who, if they read these books, would think anything about the culture, but hot damn.

1026
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:11,214
Scott: Yeah.

1027
00:57:11,475 --> 00:57:17,235
Scott: I mean, I might be friends with you, but you know, yeah, but I might be leery to understand that I am very right.

1028
00:57:17,336 --> 00:57:19,042
Scott: I am philosophically right.

1029
00:57:19,122 --> 00:57:27,620
Scott: in line with if I could make a universe, the culture is extremely close to the universe that I would make and the society that I would make to live in very, very close, if not exact.

1030
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,383
Scott: Right.

1031
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:33,337
Scott: So if you disagree with that, then we have philosophical differences.

1032
00:57:33,498 --> 00:57:33,719
Rym: Yeah.

1033
00:57:33,819 --> 00:57:35,545
Rym: And hopefully someday we'll learn about ultra space.

1034
00:57:36,168 --> 00:57:36,870
Scott: Oh my God.

1035
00:57:37,071 --> 00:57:39,179
Scott: Well, there's a lot of ultra space.

1036
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:42,090
Rym: He was like, yo, uh, I kind of don't actually know.

1037
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:49,800
Scott: Consider Phlebas has a lot of ultra space going on and even ultra space, like, you know, the grid bombs that blow you up from ultra space.

1038
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,104
Scott: And so, yeah, fascinating.

1039
00:57:58,334 --> 00:58:00,919
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1040
00:58:00,959 --> 00:58:04,573
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and brand.

1041
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:04,914
Rym: Okay.

1042
00:58:04,974 --> 00:58:05,798
Rym: For the logos.

1043
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:11,057
Scott: Be sure to visit our website@frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion, news, and more.

1044
00:58:11,298 --> 00:58:13,969
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1045
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:18,729
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.
