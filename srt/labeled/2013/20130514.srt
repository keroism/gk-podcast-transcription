00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,608
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 14th, 2013.

00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:12,952
Rym: I'm Rym.

00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:15,840
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:17,718
Rym: passwords and cheat codes.

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,958
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:26,210
Rym: So apparently I've been summoned by the queen.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,295
Rym: I guess the queens.

8
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:29,806
Rym: I guess we have multiple queens I get to.

9
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,219
Rym: finally after all these years I'm called up yet again to be kicked out of jury duty.

10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,030
Scott: well Didn't we already have a whole episode about jury duty?

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:37,973
Rym: we did and you know what.

12
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:45,516
Rym: I've never actually been selected And New York is so much different and fucked up than the rest of the country in this stuff.

13
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:51,640
Rym: basically they send you a thing That's like hey You're gonna have jury duty at some point in the next I don't know decade.

14
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:53,268
Rym: So fill out this form.

15
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:54,132
Scott: you fill out the form.

16
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:55,479
Scott: that means you're gonna have it real soon.

17
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,775
Rym: No, so I filled out the form two years ago.

18
00:00:58,795 --> 00:00:59,640
Scott: Oh, okay?

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,273
Scott: I know that my form like a week before yeah, so literally that.

20
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,397
Rym: so that's that's the main form.

21
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:06,786
Rym: so then Remember packs PAX East.

22
00:01:06,846 --> 00:01:10,357
Rym: we only went there and did our stuff two days before PAX East.

23
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:15,740
Rym: in the mail I get a summons to start calling in the Friday of packs.

24
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:19,339
Rym: So I was like nope and I deferred that shit.

25
00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:21,809
Rym: Now the cool thing is you get to pick another day to defer.

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,412
Rym: so I deferred.

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,179
Rym: I was like anytime after May 31st.

28
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:31,254
Rym: so Yesterday I got a notice saying that on May 31st.

29
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:32,538
Rym: I gotta do it.

30
00:01:32,658 --> 00:01:33,120
Scott: there you go.

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,540
Rym: So basically the weekend after anime Boston, so that's not a lot of notice.

32
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:37,564
Rym: And I like.

33
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:41,440
Rym: how on the thing it says I've already deferred it once in big letters.

34
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:44,033
Rym: So if I go try to defer it again people will give me a hard time.

35
00:01:44,074 --> 00:01:45,340
Rym: probably yeah, probably.

36
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:46,825
Rym: So we'll see how this goes.

37
00:01:47,026 --> 00:01:47,648
Scott: I'm college.

38
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:49,957
Scott: You're just calling in you don't actually to go.

39
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,207
Rym: yeah I'd rather I don't know.

40
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:58,260
Rym: I called into a federal court like every day for a week And they said nope I would like to go in because I want to do my civic duty.

41
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:01,319
Rym: And if it's some like marijuana thing I'd love to just let the guy off.

42
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,100
Scott: You're not gonna get into the courtroom you're not gonna pass the voir dire.

43
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:08,080
Scott: If you even get to the voir dire I've never even gotten that far.

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:14,787
Rym: These people are gonna take one look at me like they always do when I was called up in the past and other places And be like get this guy the fuck out.

45
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:16,312
Scott: You should just make a jpeg.

46
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,119
Scott: That's like jury duty picture a Rym.

47
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:24,215
Rym: nope I don't always serve on juries, but when I do I got my nullification ready.

48
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:32,540
Rym: sure the problem is I know if I ever get on a jury It's not gonna be like some low-level drug dealer who got busted for pot.

49
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:35,384
Scott: Who knows something.

50
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:39,700
Rym: it's never gonna be something where I'm gonna want to know they don't have trials for stuff.

51
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:41,300
Scott: That's not for serious these days.

52
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,926
Scott: It's all plea bargains and shit.

53
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:48,285
Scott: so then the only time there's a trial is if it's somewhat of a big deal ish Maybe I'll be lucky in it.

54
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:51,097
Rym: I'll get on like some defense distributed like federal trial.

55
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:51,740
Rym: That'd be awesome.

56
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:53,736
Scott: It's not a federal court is it?

57
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:56,230
Rym: Let's see what I got called up for.

58
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:57,680
Rym: I got called up for.

59
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:02,740
Rym: I might get called to any number of courts depending on what they say when I call this number.

60
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,324
Scott: Oh, yeah I had two separate ones.

61
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:10,920
Scott: one was for Queens Court and one was for federal court in Long Island And it said specifically there were two different ones.

62
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,760
Scott: So what does it have a name of a court on it, or does it say New York State or what?

63
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,685
Rym: It doesn't say yet.

64
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:16,912
Rym: I have to call in to find out.

65
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,100
Scott: That's interesting.

66
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,711
Rym: I'm a juror for all courts state or federal in Queens County.

67
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:24,860
Rym: very interesting, so I'm just a standby juror for everything.

68
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:27,809
Scott: Okay, Oh standby, so it's not even selected.

69
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:36,035
Rym: It means I call in yeah, yeah, all right, so I'm confident I will not serve on a jury anyway, and in my entire life It can happen.

70
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:46,118
Rym: So yeah doing pretty good at hockey You know not doing pretty good at hockey game seven in the first round what we're not Rangers ago.

71
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:46,520
Rym: Nowhere.

72
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:48,954
Scott: Hey, we just won and it was fine.

73
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:50,000
Rym: You and I did not win.

74
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:52,665
Scott: You said we includes you.

75
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:53,488
Rym: you know what we did.

76
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:57,873
Rym: win because the Red Wings are also moving on after their six or seven games.

77
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:03,559
Rym: The thing is the Rangers and the Red Wings are seated about the same meaning last.

78
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,280
Rym: So the only chance they will play each other is if both of them make it to the Stanley.

79
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,427
Scott: Oh, well the only reason for that is not because we're seated last It's because we're in the east and you're in the West.

80
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:22,718
Rym: it's not just that it's also because there's no way we can ever Both seated last because within our divisions we didn't do so.

81
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:26,394
Scott: well So happens, but in the playoffs any team can happen.

82
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:27,700
Scott: anything is possible.

83
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,207
Scott: You know the first the seat.

84
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:31,940
Scott: top-seated teams haven't won the Stanley Cup in a long-ass time.

85
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:35,571
Rym: I think that's because of the old divisions actually and because of the old conferences.

86
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:37,136
Scott: We got new divisions next year.

87
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:43,680
Rym: Yeah, this is I'm really curious what's gonna happen because the Red Wings have always been a little bit of RIT for a long time.

88
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:49,452
Rym: I mean they basically were not playing against the best teams So they'd win every year and you know even if they didn't.

89
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:54,079
Rym: actually you know they get swept in the first round of the Stanley Cup, but yet they'd make it there with the top seed.

90
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,516
Rym: Yeah, anywho I?

91
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,685
Rym: Kind of want to go to a Rangers game.

92
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:00,889
Scott: Can you afford it?

93
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:01,511
Rym: Well?

94
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:04,200
Scott: Yeah, can you get a ticket actually?

95
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,286
Rym: Yeah, you can buy tickets from the Rangers website.

96
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:10,959
Rym: They've got sets of two for about 200 bucks a ticket in the outer ring.

97
00:05:11,742 --> 00:05:12,665
Scott: You can't see you better.

98
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:13,709
Scott: I'm watching on TV.

99
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:14,150
Rym: They have.

100
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:15,294
Scott: have you been to the garden.

101
00:05:15,736 --> 00:05:16,820
Rym: I've never been to the garden.

102
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:19,667
Scott: Well, let me tell you the outer ring.

103
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:22,175
Scott: You're basically watching on TVs up there.

104
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:22,436
Rym: No.

105
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:22,997
Rym: It's interesting.

106
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:27,020
Rym: in the old days I would go to hockey games because you couldn't watch hockey on TV.

107
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:34,840
Rym: You couldn't tell what was happening And then they added all those graphics to make it slightly better like they'd highlight the puck so you could kind of see it.

108
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:40,774
Rym: but now with HD Unless I'm sitting in the front row my TV is actually way better.

109
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:46,430
Scott: I'm on StubHub for Let's see this game is on Tuesday, May 21st.

110
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:47,634
Rym: There's a game on the 25th.

111
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:49,039
Rym: I think that I saw tickets for.

112
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:50,687
Scott: Okay, anyway.

113
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:52,079
Scott: This is for a game a week from today.

114
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,200
Scott: Alright, let's see actual worthwhile seats.

115
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:03,093
Scott: Okay, so sitting next to the glass or in the section next to the glass guess how much per ticket per ticket is.

116
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:07,508
Scott: it is slightly off-center ice.

117
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,344
Rym: I'm gonna say 480 a ticket 1150 a ticket.

118
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,507
Rym: Wow, that's About double what I thought.

119
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:15,970
Rym: okay.

120
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,758
Scott: We're gonna go one section behind that.

121
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:25,390
Scott: so level in the middle area recalibrating farther away from the glass one section worth.

122
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,817
Rym: all right one section worth, but more close.

123
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:30,242
Rym: I'm gonna say 680.

124
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:31,687
Scott: yeah 650 all right.

125
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:35,720
Scott: I almost said 650 okay, so now all right, so now we're going up.

126
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,406
Scott: Right we're in the mezzanine, but we're in like the front The mezzanine by the front.

127
00:06:42,426 --> 00:06:44,553
Scott: the level gallery was for sale.

128
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:49,023
Rym: legit not StubHub for 250 mm-hmm.

129
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:50,347
Rym: that's what I saw.

130
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:54,239
Scott: so the pet wall which was that like Center or not quite Center.

131
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,679
Scott: yeah I'm looking in the more Center ice area.

132
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:02,180
Rym: Yeah for 170 you can sit in the worst possible seats, okay?

133
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:11,814
Scott: Let's see worst possible ticket on StubHub that I can find is in the West balcony West balcony OBS It's they're all 250 up there.

134
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:18,120
Rym: Wow Okay, yeah, you can get worse tickets just by buying them because they're I guess for whatever reason they're available.

135
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,065
Scott: Yeah, these StubHubs are all people with season tickets reselling them.

136
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:23,829
Scott: the garden is ridiculously expensive.

137
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:26,824
Scott: to go there I'd pay.

138
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:32,619
Scott: the thing is if it's like Stanley Cup finals like the cup could appear I'd probably pay whatever ridiculous.

139
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:40,099
Scott: Yeah, I used to see games like that hasn't happened since 1994 when I didn't have any money I couldn't go to New York City really just on my own.

140
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,838
Rym: No, that was the error when the Red Wings got so close so close every time it didn't quite make it.

141
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:46,445
Scott: It was the one year.

142
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:46,988
Scott: We made it.

143
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,014
Rym: I remember it was.

144
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:49,281
Rym: was it 95?

145
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:53,808
Rym: I think it was the year before the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup And I was watching the game with my brother.

146
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,862
Rym: my parents had just bought a huge TV non widescreen CRT.

147
00:07:57,943 --> 00:07:58,405
Scott: they didn't exist.

148
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:02,221
Scott: I know this TV was Gigantic.

149
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:03,927
Scott: Well, they were tiger LCD.

150
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:07,500
Rym: not we bought it specifically for hockey watching and nothing else.

151
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:13,599
Rym: Like I remember I was mad at my mom because I wanted a computer instead Mmm, but the computer was still like ten times the cost of that TV.

152
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:20,969
Rym: but anyway And my brother was upstairs watching the game on his own TV and Fedorov scored on our own goal Mm-hmm, like it was an accident.

153
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:37,368
Rym: It got him a hat trick And when he and we were already down by one I think I don't remember the details But when Fedorov scored on our own goal, I hear my little brother go ah, and then I just hear things breaking Speaking of own goals.

154
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:39,460
Scott: right today was actually at work.

155
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:44,940
Scott: I watched the natural selection to European finals of evil team versus silly team.

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,285
Rym: Wait a minute can own go cuz.

157
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:50,280
Rym: in old NS the own goal was anytime you use babblers anywhere near your fucking high.

158
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,004
Scott: But evil team won again.

159
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,330
Scott: But there was a funny moment.

160
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:05,880
Scott: that were own goal reminded me of where basically the funny team bit, you know destroyed the IP made a little base rush and They killed the commander of the evil team.

161
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:12,860
Scott: So someone who wasn't the commander the evil team got in the chair to build an IP Yeah, accidentally dropped a few armories that they then had to destroy.

162
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:17,989
Rym: So there you go Not just leave him sitting there hanging out.

163
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,060
Scott: And yeah, you don't need three armories in the base.

164
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:22,645
Rym: You can have a strategy around that.

165
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:24,129
Scott: What is the strategy?

166
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:26,435
Rym: I mean, I remember my my old NS.

167
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:30,800
Scott: all OC strategy OCs don't really exist like that anymore.

168
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,380
Rym: I know thing is back in the day before they added the anti lameness filter and There was no limit on what you could put anywhere.

169
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,380
Rym: I remember we would make walls of OCs for high and they would just be behind them would be a wall.

170
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,906
Scott: Yeah, but they are in those days.

171
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:47,094
Scott: You had a freaking HMGs to cut them down.

172
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:48,258
Scott: There's no HMG anymore.

173
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:51,289
Rym: Yeah Anyway, anyway, and this is fun.

174
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,975
Rym: Yeah, so you got any news?

175
00:09:53,717 --> 00:10:02,823
Scott: Yeah, so apparently People on the forum are telling me that there was an Adventure Time video game for the 3ds MDS called Adventure Time Colon.

176
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:04,508
Scott: hey Ice King exclamation.

177
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:05,773
Scott: Why'd you steal our garbage?

178
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:07,840
Scott: And apparently it's a Zelda 2 game.

179
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:13,540
Scott: I remember when I got it very very short apparently, but very good but short.

180
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,846
Rym: I remember when that came out.

181
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:19,286
Rym: all of our friends who were in the know or in the game Were going crazy about it, right?

182
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:21,997
Scott: I don't think it's worth any, you know the full price of a 3ds game.

183
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,354
Scott: But anyway, they're coming out with a new Adventure Time game called Adventure Time colon.

184
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,260
Scott: explore the dungeon because I don't know.

185
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:34,688
Scott: Exclamation point and I don't know is in all caps Much like the last game.

186
00:10:34,728 --> 00:10:39,388
Scott: it'll be developed by the same people and Have oversight by P Ward.

187
00:10:39,849 --> 00:11:00,050
Scott: So I'm assuming this is pretty much gonna be like Pokemon Adventure Time mystery dungeon, which is a roguelike basically and it says players striving to save the candy kingdom by exploring the mysterious secret royal dungeon deep beneath the land of And you can play as like freaking every character.

188
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:01,977
Rym: so I'm digging that.

189
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:06,760
Rym: yeah, I Don't but I remember our friends all going crazy about it and the soundtrack and everything.

190
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:09,716
Rym: We were not adventure time people.

191
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:10,340
Rym: It's that way.

192
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,257
Scott: Yeah, the difference is is that the last Adventure Time game was DS 3ds.

193
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,770
Scott: This one is Wii U 3ds ps3 Xbox and PC PC.

194
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,582
Scott: Is it?

195
00:11:20,662 --> 00:11:21,305
Rym: I did not know.

196
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:21,927
Scott: there you go.

197
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,580
Scott: So new game is actually gonna be on all the platforms with its roguelike ness.

198
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:28,026
Rym: You know, it's funny.

199
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:30,295
Rym: You mentioned that because I got a sort of personal news.

200
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:31,620
Scott: I'm guessing it's for hook likeness.

201
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,304
Scott: It's a dungeon.

202
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:33,591
Scott: Come on a couple days ago.

203
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:36,736
Rym: I got an email the email Microsoft.

204
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:41,740
Rym: Your Xbox live gold is going to expire and auto renew.

205
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,089
Scott: I thought yours was already aspired.

206
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:47,000
Rym: so I guess I bought a year ahead way back.

207
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:49,258
Scott: I still have mine still going but it's not.

208
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,692
Rym: I bought a gift certificate that was discounted on Amazon.

209
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:58,928
Rym: that was cheaper than a year and I used that to get my year Way back, so I forgot about it.

210
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:02,720
Rym: My Xbox hasn't been turned on in like five months.

211
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:11,276
Scott: I used mine for Netflix only because the surround sound works As opposed to the PC where it also works, but not quite so Microsoft.

212
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:12,380
Rym: Thanks for sending me that email.

213
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:17,188
Rym: It reminded me to go shut off the auto renew Because Xbox is dead to me.

214
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:21,586
Rym: It exists solely to play Street Fighter 4 and Pac-man Street Fighter.

215
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:22,812
Scott: you can get on the PC.

216
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:27,552
Scott: I know but I bought it already But I didn't even upgrade it to the arcade version.

217
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:28,817
Rym: I'm not gonna read.

218
00:12:28,857 --> 00:12:31,550
Rym: I got the arcade one Yeah, so I'm not gonna re buy it.

219
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:37,708
Rym: But yeah, my basically I. It's funny because it wasn't that long ago We said PC gaming was dead and it was back then.

220
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:41,582
Rym: don't don't think that I'm gonna retract my statement that it was dead at That time.

221
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:44,611
Scott: the seas of change are change.

222
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,754
Scott: Oh, it's the winds of change.

223
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:54,840
Scott: Yeah our change, but it is It's PC gaming season and I basically has been for years, but it wasn't when we started GeekNights Which shows you just how fucking old GeekNights.

224
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,316
Rym: It's only Nintendo games that aren't really PC.

225
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:08,986
Rym: And I think the answer is I'm either gonna play those games that exist on DS's eventually, I'll buy a 3ds light 2 But otherwise all PC.

226
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:12,359
Rym: So if a game only comes out in Xbox, I'm just gonna assume that'll eventually be on the PC.

227
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:13,608
Rym: I mean mark the ninja.

228
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:15,300
Rym: I've been playing on my HD PC just fine.

229
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,811
Scott: Thankfully, there is not even one Wii U game yet that needs to be played.

230
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:19,252
Rym: Yep.

231
00:13:19,353 --> 00:13:19,613
Rym: Nothing.

232
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,660
Scott: Nothing critical zero Wii U games.

233
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:26,817
Rym: So, uh, yeah I let that expire and it was funny because it was kind of convoluted the process.

234
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:32,000
Scott: to turn it off You log in xbox.com you go to your setting account settings and you turn off auto-renew with a checkbox.

235
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,382
Rym: Not quite.

236
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:38,236
Rym: So first I had to go into like change manage my subscriptions and there were two options.

237
00:13:38,597 --> 00:13:44,039
Rym: What option was like Change auto-renew settings, but under there was not an option to turn it off.

238
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:48,300
Rym: There were two options and then there's a button that said don't see what you're looking for.

239
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,840
Rym: So I clicked on that and I dug around and eventually I got to the page.

240
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:59,679
Rym: Let me turn it off and actually the account I set up can log into two Different Microsoft websites that have slightly different options.

241
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:01,770
Scott: I ran in a lot of weird.

242
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,980
Scott: you think about it, right?

243
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,979
Scott: All this Xbox stuff is really helping people out who don't have computers attached to their TV.

244
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:14,219
Scott: It is well There's a and all this stuff only really seems pointless to us because we fucking attach computers to our TV and it's it's really.

245
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:16,635
Scott: all It is is an HDMI port.

246
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:17,139
Scott: That's it.

247
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:23,559
Rym: Well when I shut it down it popped up a thing and it's like are you sure you're gonna lose access to?

248
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:28,053
Rym: and it was Multiplayer online gaming Netflix on your TV.

249
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:32,280
Scott: and I'm like, yeah Ten other things to get Netflix on my TV kinda.

250
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:35,148
Rym: I had a Roku when they first came out.

251
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:38,436
Scott: apparently the Roku now can do a million things including video games.

252
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:44,344
Scott: Yeah, it's crazy but none of them do as much as a Computer.

253
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:46,558
Rym: Well, it's good and bad because it just shows that.

254
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,879
Rym: Don't realize they can plug a computer into the TV.

255
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:54,555
Scott: Make computers just buy, you know parts in bulk like just normal PC parts.

256
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:55,939
Scott: put together computers like we do.

257
00:14:56,501 --> 00:15:07,839
Scott: You know like Dell did when Dell started, you know, Michael Dell in his dorm or whatever putting computers together selling them HDMI ports and we'll be like these are specifically computers for plugging into your TV.

258
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:13,317
Rym: Well, we pre set them up with drivers with the right interface with steam and everything already installed.

259
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:16,876
Rym: Yeah, exactly To sell them as appliances Don't be like.

260
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:24,000
Scott: hey These are you know, the like ultimate set-top box does everything every other box does for free no monthly fee.

261
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:25,920
Scott: Just buy the box set forever.

262
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:30,820
Rym: Well, you know, this is a common trend because do you know how many times especially now go looking at convention stuff?

263
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:39,228
Rym: I see people who do panels or talk about things like Halo the Revolutionary like multiplayer game.

264
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:40,693
Scott: if you never it's like.

265
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:43,060
Scott: yeah, you never get quick before.

266
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:47,280
Rym: I mean if you have you've never had a computer before played games on them.

267
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,426
Scott: It's a lot of people.

268
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:51,020
Scott: they just they're in a world and they don't see the whole picture.

269
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,580
Scott: They only see their part of the picture.

270
00:15:52,687 --> 00:16:06,720
Rym: well remember to this day services like Hulu give you different content on a phone as opposed to a Computer as opposed to a set-top box because they think that those three are actually distinct use cases and distinct devices.

271
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:09,109
Scott: Anyway, we've gone over that a thousand times.

272
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,860
Rym: We have so I have a much more interesting news.

273
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:26,971
Rym: Okay, and this has been around but a lot of people weren't talking about it until there was the sort of financial disclosure And then suddenly there were a bunch of articles in mainstream things about it, but basically World of Warcraft lost 1.3 million subscribers.

274
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,980
Scott: everyone knows World of Warcraft is losing players.

275
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:30,002
Rym: Yeah But no one.

276
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:36,465
Rym: most people did not have the numbers because they weren't public and to a lot of it was speculation Division Bob Blizzard.

277
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:39,640
Scott: those numbers have to sort of be public because that's the where they get most of their money from.

278
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:42,988
Rym: They lost 1.3 million users.

279
00:16:43,048 --> 00:16:45,196
Rym: out of how many out of like 8 million?

280
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:47,466
Rym: it says here 8 points That's how many you know.

281
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:50,140
Rym: 8.3 million is all that's left which includes games and everything.

282
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,390
Scott: So they had about 10 million and now they're down to 8.3.

283
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,514
Scott: Yeah, so there's 1.3 million.

284
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:58,150
Rym: It's still a lot of players just in the first quarter of this year.

285
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:58,652
Rym: Mmm.

286
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:01,200
Rym: So that's just January February March.

287
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,399
Rym: Okay, it's already late May.

288
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:12,598
Rym: hmm, so People are talking a lot about this and it looks like even as you know in 2012 they had a big drop in subscribers, but not nearly as much as now.

289
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:18,819
Rym: I Think what's going on here is not what a lot of people are saying so I'm gonna posit something to you Scott.

290
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,825
Rym: I want to see if you think this is an interesting theory.

291
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:30,730
Rym: I think the primary reason for this is a combination of Cellphone browser free-to-play games.

292
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:33,180
Rym: Yeah, but that's not the primary thing.

293
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:35,119
Rym: It's that coupled with MOBAs.

294
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:40,124
Rym: So here's why I think that There are.

295
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:43,718
Rym: there are two classes of people I guess three classes of people who play World of Warcraft.

296
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,898
Scott: now One MOBAs, I mean MOBA is the biggest game right now.

297
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:53,720
Scott: League of Legends Doesn't mean the people who were playing World of Warcraft.

298
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,798
Rym: There's a very specific reason why there's three types of people who play.

299
00:17:58,838 --> 00:18:06,500
Rym: Wow People who haven't ever played an MMO before and they hear about them and that's the one they probably will find and play.

300
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,664
Rym: It's like EverQuest used to be.

301
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,877
Rym: so they're just like the MMO noobs and they're gonna be.

302
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:11,780
Rym: you know, people get addicted.

303
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,958
Rym: I got addicted to MMOs the first time I saw an MMO the realm.

304
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:18,975
Rym: I I sat killing guys for one experience point.

305
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:21,699
Scott: I played muds in high school.

306
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:27,760
Rym: So the second class of people are depressed middle-aged housewives and all that assorted.

307
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:38,520
Rym: You know type of person the people who play for the grind and they socialize but they're not really hardcore about the game But they keep playing it and keep grinding and it consumes a lot of their free time.

308
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:40,779
Rym: Maybe they RP in there with their other friends.

309
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:48,420
Rym: The third group of people who continue to play Wow are the people who are into the raid clan guild culture.

310
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:54,284
Rym: They were the ones where they leveled leveling up and going through the story They can give one fuck about.

311
00:18:54,565 --> 00:19:03,252
Rym: they had their characters at the right level to then meet with their guild and do raids and that Experience of here is my team with our voice chat.

312
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:05,400
Rym: We're gonna go raid Leroy Jenkins style.

313
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:14,379
Rym: That was a whole class of World of Warcraft players where the raids were their thing and everything else about the game was just fluff And and basically ready rooms.

314
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:26,475
Rym: Those people are the people who are leaving Wow to play MOBAs because MOBAs give them that same feeling Without the World of Warcraft stuff all around it and they fee.

315
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:29,024
Rym: it's much more competitive For them.

316
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:34,260
Rym: it rewards their skill and their coordination as a clan or a team much more red.

317
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,866
Scott: I think you're thinking too hard about this.

318
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:40,325
Scott: You know why people aren't playing Wow, cuz it's just fucking stale It's day.

319
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:42,696
Scott: You know, that's just all there is to it, right?

320
00:19:42,797 --> 00:20:00,560
Scott: No game No matter how much you keep updating it right no matter how much new stuff you keep adding to it Eventually any individual person right is like I've played this enough even if you you know Pretty much maxed it out for as long as you can get someone to stay.

321
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:03,910
Rym: But so here's my counterpoint to that.

322
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,974
Rym: This is still just a theory.

323
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,220
Rym: I got to do some more research.

324
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:08,340
Rym: I want to ask a lot of people who have quit.

325
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,640
Scott: I'm sure there are people who have stopped playing Wow and now our League of Legends players.

326
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,389
Scott: That doesn't mean that like League of Legends was like.

327
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,811
Scott: if League of Legends didn't exist if MOBAs didn't take off you think people Would still be playing Wow.

328
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:28,001
Scott: No, actually, yes I know I think that Wow would have lost these players no matter what because there's also other games that would have taken them Away.

329
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:33,039
Scott: what game pretty much whatever game existed at this time would be?

330
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,303
Rym: no I don't think so.

331
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:34,925
Scott: No bigger.

332
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:36,349
Scott: Look Wow is stale.

333
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:40,578
Scott: people are leaving it because it is just old and they're not you know Into it anymore.

334
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:43,611
Scott: They're gonna go to whatever game is out there to go to.

335
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:48,197
Scott: they go to tf2 some of them go to the other MMOs that are free to play.

336
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:53,179
Rym: So Scott I don't think there was any significant shift of people who quit playing Wow in order to play tf2.

337
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:59,110
Rym: But I think there was a significant shift of people who quit Wow specifically to play League of Legends.

338
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:07,646
Scott: No, I think people just quit Wow and These other games happen to be coming up at the same time as Wow is going down And people are leaving Wow.

339
00:21:07,707 --> 00:21:09,132
Scott: before the MOBAs went up.

340
00:21:09,975 --> 00:21:11,220
Rym: They were but not at this rate.

341
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:22,846
Rym: There's been a rapid increase in the rate of decrease Yeah, just recently and part of my hypothesis is that if you look at the history of MMOs It's a correlation.

342
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:23,929
Scott: There's no causation.

343
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,817
Scott: People aren't saying fuck Wow because League of Legends exists.

344
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:27,860
Rym: I think they are.

345
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:31,610
Scott: What evidence do you have for that besides the correlation?

346
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:34,940
Scott: so that happens to be the hot game now and Wow is less hot.

347
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:35,402
Scott: So

348
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:50,400
Rym: in the past when people left an MMO as opposed to just keeping their account kind of active It's because they went to another MMO and like I said There's different classes of players the people who are all guilty and would really only do the raids and that's all they cared about that like pseudo competitive circuit.

349
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:54,820
Rym: They as a group played Wow only for that.

350
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:00,560
Rym: I was reading some other game that provided that to them unless they went over to like Eve and that's not their kind of game.

351
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:22,740
Scott: So I was reading articles recently and it was about you know It was written by the one of the hardest core rating people because like the hardest core rating group was breaking up and giving up And it talked about like the hardest core rating competition at the top levels yeah, and pretty much everything they said were they were just talking about Wow and how Wow is all kind of blend now and They had didn't say anything else about another game pulling them away.

352
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:36,819
Rym: Here's why I think Wow feels bleh because one The rating people eventually get too good and look at the differentiation and skill in MOBA's for example Where the guy who's just a little bit better and studies the game more gets a reward.

353
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,700
Rym: Wow and kind of really leveled out at the top in terms of skill.

354
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:53,104
Rym: And I think the guilds and all the other reasons like the core like social Enablers in those guilds were leaving for other reasons because they were bored with Wow or because they were just playing free-to-play Browser games or whatever.

355
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:54,590
Scott: I think you're just seeing a correlation of.

356
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,100
Scott: these are the hot game now and that game is losing players.

357
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,793
Scott: Therefore make it jump to a conclusion, which is not one.

358
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:02,739
Rym: I didn't say that's all of them.

359
00:23:03,302 --> 00:23:04,791
Rym: I I Scott.

360
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:07,843
Rym: I suggested something pretty small.

361
00:23:08,164 --> 00:23:16,480
Rym: I suggested that of One of the classes of players a significant number of them are playing MOBA's instead of what they used to do.

362
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:19,590
Scott: But what I'm saying you're right is not a causation.

363
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,920
Scott: League of Legends didn't pull people out of Wow if League of Legends didn't exist.

364
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:26,574
Scott: Right if MOBA's weren't hot right now, maybe fighting games were hot right now.

365
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:29,610
Scott: the people who stopped playing Wow Maybe they'd be playing fighting games.

366
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,759
Rym: I guarantee that's not true.

367
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:35,670
Rym: Okay because the mentality of people who play these games is not to go from.

368
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:41,499
Rym: the people who play the game for the guild stuff are not gonna Quit it to play a single-player game.

369
00:23:42,306 --> 00:23:48,840
Rym: Fighting games not a single-player game In the sense that they don't have a team with them of five people on their vent server.

370
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:50,789
Rym: They play for that coordination.

371
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,798
Rym: planetside could take some of them.

372
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:56,833
Scott: You're assuming that these people were taken from Wow.

373
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,740
Scott: it's they left Wow because Wow is stale.

374
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:02,325
Scott: Person that left stale.

375
00:24:02,385 --> 00:24:06,059
Scott: Wow fell wherever they fell onto whatever game they fell into.

376
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,729
Scott: yeah No I'm saying a lot and there are many games to fall into.

377
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:14,459
Rym: just stop playing Wow because it was stale and there Happens to be the biggest bucket right now.

378
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,203
Rym: I don't think.

379
00:24:15,283 --> 00:24:18,600
Rym: I don't think the fact that it's the biggest bucket has anything to do with people shifting to it.

380
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,235
Rym: I think it's because of the guild culture and not really.

381
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,540
Rym: I think it's almost a hundred percent ago.

382
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:25,516
Scott: There are really League of Legends guilds.

383
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:42,347
Rym: Yeah, there's teams and most and most it's a team of five people yeah, and they're the sharding into these small teams gives them the same game feel as they would have gotten from the raids that were increasingly becoming stale and Trovertrodden Whatever, okay.

384
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,920
Rym: I think it's a no evidence whatsoever.

385
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:52,704
Scott: If there's any game when League of Legends becomes unhot right and people start leaving it because it's old and stale and another game is Hot you're gonna.

386
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:55,440
Scott: Just say oh that game stole all the League of Legends players.

387
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:55,962
Scott: No, it didn't.

388
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:56,162
Scott: it's.

389
00:24:56,544 --> 00:24:59,995
Scott: one game is losing five Larry another gains some players.

390
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:01,199
Scott: You're taking whatever that happens.

391
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:16,426
Scott: of course You're taking the kind of bullshit view Evidence to prove that the people were pulled out as opposed to you know or that the majority of the Wow people leaving Wow are Now playing.

392
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:17,799
Rym: that which is not what I said.

393
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,470
Scott: There's no Causational thing there whatsoever.

394
00:25:21,691 --> 00:25:29,855
Rym: You're really making this weird assumption that People that games are completely fungible that oh I quit playing counter-strike because I don't know.

395
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:31,359
Rym: Dungeons and Dragons 5 came out.

396
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:32,725
Scott: No, they're left.

397
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,938
Scott: They stopped playing Wow because wow was boring.

398
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:37,580
Scott: now There's no connection to any other game whatsoever.

399
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:39,328
Rym: God wow had been boring for a long time.

400
00:25:39,368 --> 00:25:44,040
Rym: and how many people bitched about how boring while was But kept paying and playing anyway.

401
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:47,352
Rym: Why just recently has the rate of quitting accelerated so rad?

402
00:25:47,372 --> 00:25:49,500
Scott: the rate of quitting has been going on for a lot longer.

403
00:25:49,642 --> 00:25:50,879
Scott: I just didn't know about it.

404
00:25:51,622 --> 00:25:56,800
Rym: No, they released these numbers and all their reports Scott, yeah, and they've been that large for a while.

405
00:25:57,741 --> 00:25:58,905
Rym: No, and you can look that up.

406
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:02,639
Scott: Yes Wow has had tens of millions of players and now it's down to less than 10 million.

407
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,869
Scott: It's you're like, oh my god, they lost 1 million.

408
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:06,758
Scott: Whatever they lost a millions in the other quarters.

409
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:09,333
Rym: Also Did they really do you know that?

410
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:12,968
Scott: Yeah Wow has been going downhill for like a year or two.

411
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,200
Rym: Yes, and the rate has rapidly increased just recently.

412
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:20,780
Scott: It's it was already the thing that triggered the going down was long ago.

413
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,413
Scott: You're assuming that something that happened right now has caused it to go it.

414
00:26:24,474 --> 00:26:26,220
Scott: No, it's because it's been a snowball.

415
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:36,287
Scott: This is just the middle of this Was pushed a couple years ago, I think that this that the mobas caused a the mobas snowball.

416
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:39,643
Rym: the mobas are just Finally had.

417
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:43,717
Scott: some are the pile of snow at the bottom of the Snowball Hill.

418
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:44,660
Scott: I don't think they are.

419
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:52,498
Rym: No, okay, I Disagree with you strongly and I asked the listeners what they think.

420
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:55,612
Rym: Okay, cuz so far every time we've ever had a discussion like this.

421
00:26:55,652 --> 00:26:56,435
Rym: They always side with me.

422
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:57,440
Scott: All right, how about this?

423
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,203
Scott: I'm all right.

424
00:26:58,364 --> 00:26:58,765
Scott: Here you go.

425
00:26:58,806 --> 00:26:59,107
Scott: We'll go.

426
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:06,315
Scott: anecdotal cuz you know, you have no evidence anyway, so I'll go with my Have is I was trolling around a bunch of old Wow forums.

427
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:07,480
Scott: Okay, cool ready?

428
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,788
Scott: Think about all our friends.

429
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:10,240
Scott: a lot of our friends played Wow, right?

430
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,293
Rym: Yeah A lot of them right and a lot of them are playing dota.

431
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,559
Scott: now how many of them?

432
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:16,626
Scott: Who do we know that played Wow?

433
00:27:16,706 --> 00:27:18,933
Scott: is now playing mobas Wyatt one?

434
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:20,920
Rym: Yeah, and all his friends?

435
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,289
Rym: I think John this is playing them too.

436
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,316
Scott: Who's that John?

437
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,913
Rym: Okay, maybe yeah, right as a percentage of our friends.

438
00:27:29,094 --> 00:27:29,496
Rym: So you guys?

439
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:30,660
Scott: so but the thing is okay.

440
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:42,560
Scott: So who used to play Wow, Scott Johnson Pete, you know, Lisa James all these people All quit well a long time ago and none of them playing mode because they're not part of this wave at all.

441
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,854
Rym: They're the ones who quit for the stale reasons.

442
00:27:44,894 --> 00:27:45,740
Rym: They were they were playing it.

443
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,888
Scott: I think that's most of the people you don't have.

444
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:50,900
Scott: those rating people are not the millions of people.

445
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:56,000
Scott: I think there's a very small community of mere hundreds of people who are the crazy raid people.

446
00:27:56,301 --> 00:28:09,449
Rym: Because I think like those people all our friends who quit was a combination of one people who only played because of social pressure from their other friends who actually were into the game and the other people who played Played because they were depressed and/or addicted to the grind.

447
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:11,175
Rym: Yeah, that's that.

448
00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:13,021
Rym: check that other class of people I can.

449
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:15,068
Scott: only that's most of the players that is most.

450
00:28:15,088 --> 00:28:18,640
Scott: the rating people is maybe hundreds of people maybe a handful of thousands.

451
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,583
Scott: Yes, not one point.

452
00:28:19,603 --> 00:28:19,884
Scott: Whatever.

453
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:24,740
Rym: I do not disagree that the majority of the players of Wow are the depressed addicted to the grind people.

454
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:27,095
Rym: They're one of the significant class of players.

455
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:27,760
Rym: They're the over.

456
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:30,070
Scott: Legends never existed.

457
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,480
Scott: Wow would still be losing players the same rate right now.

458
00:28:32,822 --> 00:28:34,900
Rym: I think the gilding people would have stuck around longer.

459
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:43,022
Rym: No, I think they would have because they wouldn't have anywhere to go with to get their vent fix on Coordinate my bullshit.

460
00:28:43,603 --> 00:28:45,386
Scott: Anyway, let's I need those deeps.

461
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:46,327
Scott: Let's continue.

462
00:28:52,437 --> 00:28:58,180
Rym: So I ride a bike in New York City And everyone seems to complain we not talk about the same thing.

463
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:03,020
Rym: We had a bunch of listeners who were like all you guys ever talk about is New York City and how awesome it is now?

464
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,204
Scott: Well, it kind of is.

465
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:08,080
Rym: it is but - I don't think you guys realize that we lived in Beacon.

466
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,127
Rym: We talked about Beacon just as awesome often.

467
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:13,600
Rym: We just didn't talk about how awesome it was because it was not but stuff happened.

468
00:29:13,862 --> 00:29:19,572
Rym: I think you guys forget how often we would Talk about how every year there was that crazy st.

469
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:22,220
Rym: Patrick's Day pub crawl that would ruin our city for a day.

470
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:27,780
Rym: Yep, or the various shenanigans anyway, you know old ladies in the basement getting mad at us about Obama.

471
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:34,640
Rym: Okay, so yeah, this is a video that summarizes a kind of person who really exists.

472
00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:36,791
Rym: he lives only in major cities.

473
00:29:37,353 --> 00:29:45,351
Rym: he rides a fixie bike and You will see people who act exactly Like this without exaggeration or hyperbole at all.

474
00:29:45,672 --> 00:29:50,140
Rym: if you go to any major city and look for bicyclists You'll see one within a few minutes Really?

475
00:29:50,220 --> 00:30:06,746
Scott: They got to make fixies illegal and they got to have a cop stand there and he sees a fixie stops him and says you attached this brake to your bike or I throw it in this pickup truck and if you don't put the brake on your bike he Throws it in the pickup truck and puts a sticker on it and says come you can pay 200 bucks to get it back and you Can't ride it on the road again.

476
00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:07,511
Rym: brake and a belt.

477
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:10,379
Scott: what I really don't need a bell You need the brake you need lights.

478
00:30:11,521 --> 00:30:26,840
Rym: Culture is how anti-authoritarian it is to the point that those dudes, you know in the video The guy's blowing a whistle and shouting all the time That kind of dude Literally will not put a bell on his bike Because there's a law that says you have to have a noise-making device to warn of danger.

479
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:30,055
Rym: That has to be loud enough and a certain, you know There's all these rules about it.

480
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:37,493
Rym: That dude is just so mad about authority that he won't put a bell on his bike or a horn and instead It's a more important.

481
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:53,362
Rym: instead He insists that he can shout loud enough and will argue violently with the cop who tries to give him a ticket by shouting and then go to court and shout in court to Prove that he is loud enough on his own to not need a critical and basic safety feature of a bike Mm-hmm.

482
00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:55,349
Rym: So yeah, those these guys exist.

483
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:58,560
Rym: This video is not a comedy sketch, but a documentary.

484
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:03,939
Scott: You got a thing of the day, oh, I guess I have one of those.

485
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:05,924
Scott: It's hockey related.

486
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,509
Scott: Okay, check this out.

487
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:08,292
Rym: Is it an own goal?

488
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:09,435
Rym: No fight.

489
00:31:09,676 --> 00:31:11,903
Rym: No own goal fight It's close.

490
00:31:12,365 --> 00:31:14,773
Scott: So in we're about to play the Bruins.

491
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:16,860
Scott: next it's gonna be rough, right?

492
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,573
Scott: At least the Bruins don't have theirs, you know piece of shit goalie anymore.

493
00:31:20,593 --> 00:31:22,140
Rym: They're seated pretty high, aren't they?

494
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:23,670
Scott: Yeah, we'll see how this goes.

495
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,144
Scott: Yeah, our goal is a brick wall though So we'll see whatever.

496
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:29,260
Scott: but this is from 2009 at a Bruins Jets game.

497
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:36,186
Scott: Actually, it was the game was in 1987. the video was uploaded in 2009 On youtubes.

498
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:44,000
Scott: basically some dude Jumps over the boards and gets on the ice and tries to mess with the game.

499
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:46,152
Rym: I have never seen that happen.

500
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:50,550
Rym: Yeah, and Well that happened at a minor league game.

501
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:53,400
Rym: after a fight broke out a bunch of people in the audience jumped over.

502
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,410
Rym: Well, they jumped over the glass and started fighting with the players.

503
00:31:57,113 --> 00:32:03,540
Scott: Yeah, so he suffers the You know consequences there for his his actions.

504
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:09,799
Rym: There's only one thing you can say when you see what I'm assuming happens in this video happen, and that's uh, that's a shame.

505
00:32:10,705 --> 00:32:11,371
Scott: It's not a shame.

506
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:11,754
Scott: It's deserved.

507
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:14,203
Scott: Don't go.

508
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,940
Scott: I mean if you're gonna run onto the field in some sport do the naked soccer thing, right?

509
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,782
Scott: They're sort of used to that.

510
00:32:18,943 --> 00:32:21,390
Scott: Yeah, do not in the last choice.

511
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:24,800
Scott: The last choice is the hockey ice.

512
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,340
Scott: I would do football before I do hockey exactly and football is a really bad fucking choice.

513
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:36,031
Scott: It's like right, but do not go on the ice in hockey, you know You can throw an octopus out there if you really want to.

514
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:41,090
Rym: the Blackhawks are actually doing really well this year Like the best team I know kind of worried.

515
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,795
Scott: they're really great last year too.

516
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:45,480
Scott: if you didn't notice I know games tomorrow.

517
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:49,450

Rym: Judge an anime by its cover and how to recommend anime.

00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,507
Rym: My tools probably gonna be there doing his thing.

535
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:40,969
Scott: Definitely.

536
00:33:41,471 --> 00:33:43,338
Rym: I don't think Darryl and all them are coming.

537
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:45,727
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I like Darryl stuff.

538
00:33:45,787 --> 00:33:48,236
Scott: Yeah, but I'm saying it's like why would you come from Florida?

539
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:52,551
Rym: Maybe Would you come from Florida if it were packs?

540
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:54,037
Scott: Well packs is different.

541
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:54,620
Scott: I may Boston.

542
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,824
Rym: Yeah, well, what if I would have had?

543
00:33:55,864 --> 00:33:57,409
Rym: what if anime were to us?

544
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,272
Rym: what games are?

545
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,440
Rym: Yeah, that's still not happening.

546
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,706
Scott: Other meta moments that account.

547
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:07,191
Rym: don't fucking submit your panels.

548
00:34:07,331 --> 00:34:08,534
Rym: The deadline was a while ago.

549
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:09,678
Rym: We're almost done with the schedule.

550
00:34:09,777 --> 00:34:10,179
Scott: tough shit.

551
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,984
Scott: Also packs.

552
00:34:13,043 --> 00:34:25,616
Rym: Australia, we're gonna be there doing beyond Dungeons & Dragons But a completely rewritten and reimagined one also aimed at an audience that doesn't quite know these indie games as well as you guys all Do well, we assume Australia doesn't know about them as well as we do.

553
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:30,880
Scott: Yeah And the book club book is the player of games by E&M banks.

554
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,917
Scott: I finished it and I'm actually reading the book that came before it considered Phlebas the book that came before.

555
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:43,833
Scott: I mean cuz you know It's you know player of games is second in the culture series is the second book But it's not like freakin Lord of the Rings.

556
00:34:43,853 --> 00:34:44,719
Scott: They go in order, right?

557
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,692
Scott: It's basically a bunch of books that are all in the same universe But there's not any sort of serial storytelling.

558
00:34:50,712 --> 00:34:52,137
Scott: so you can just read player of games.

559
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,080
Scott: No problem.

560
00:34:54,663 --> 00:35:00,760
Scott: But the first book which I'm now reading Really, you know it teaches you more about the setting that you know.

561
00:35:01,162 --> 00:35:03,172
Scott: And it's sort of I think both books.

562
00:35:03,293 --> 00:35:10,271
Scott: having reading the second one first It's sort of like you learn the setting from either one, you know, you know It's not like you're reading either one of them.

563
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,564
Scott: You're like, oh, I don't know the setting It's like.

564
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:13,616
Scott: no you read player games.

565
00:35:13,636 --> 00:35:16,960
Scott: You're fine You figure out what the deal is with the culture and you read the first one.

566
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,857
Scott: It's like oh you figure out what the deal is with the culture either way.

567
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:20,380
Scott: You're good.

568
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:29,404
Rym: So I remember a time my youth long ago where a friend of mine typed in the blood code and Sega.

569
00:35:31,603 --> 00:35:33,520
Rym: There was no blood code in the Super Nintendo.

570
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:34,099
Scott: That's right.

571
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:39,820
Rym: And I remember he did that and I was like, oh my god, and I was like, how do I do this in Nintendo?

572
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,262
Rym: Can't ride?

573
00:35:41,643 --> 00:35:43,488
Rym: I couldn't because the buttons don't quite match up.

574
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,517
Rym: and then I looked in magazines and there wasn't one.

575
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:47,781
Rym: and then about all Those.

576
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:51,056
Rym: everyone had that dipshit friend who would make shit up about video games.

577
00:35:51,297 --> 00:35:54,517
Rym: and he was like, oh, yeah There's a blood code and you just make some fucking bullshit up.

578
00:35:55,561 --> 00:36:00,864
Rym: He's like, yeah, you got hit up up down down down up up up down down up down up down B. And then you got a hold.

579
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:02,611
Rym: select and press start.

580
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:03,775
Scott: Do you know what the blood code is?

581
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,302
Rym: I Don't remember.

582
00:36:05,342 --> 00:36:06,005
Rym: I didn't have a Sega.

583
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:06,407
Rym: I wasn't.

584
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:07,392
Rym: I was one of the smart kids.

585
00:36:07,473 --> 00:36:08,759
Scott: It was a b a c a b b.

586
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:28,975
Rym: Maybe it's just anecdotal but where I grew up Anecdotally the kids who came from nice homes who were smart in school and got good grades and didn't get in trouble all at Nintendo and By and large the kids who didn't get good grades and came from broken co.

587
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:32,407
Scott: broken homes had Sega Where I came from.

588
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:35,320
Scott: the kids who are really good had fucking both.

589
00:36:37,202 --> 00:36:37,784
Rym: Who had both?

590
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:39,792
Rym: and he also had a neo geo.

591
00:36:39,812 --> 00:36:40,335
Scott: Okay.

592
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:41,660
Scott: No one had neo geos rich.

593
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,280
Scott: We only saw that in video game magazines.

594
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:47,780
Rym: I. the thing is he was one of those kids who would invite you over for like cuz he's rich.

595
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,500
Rym: He's got like his fancy game, but then he wouldn't actually let you play it.

596
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,862
Rym: He would just play in front of you and then eventually he'd like it'd be time to go home Mm-hmm.

597
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:56,227
Rym: I stopped hanging out with that kid.

598
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:57,952
Rym: Yeah, his name was Dave.

599
00:36:58,173 --> 00:37:00,060
Rym: I think I don't even remember.

600
00:37:01,204 --> 00:37:02,718
Rym: I literally don't remember that guy's name.

601
00:37:03,484 --> 00:37:05,257
Rym: Okay, my friend Joe had a Nintendo though.

602
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:17,446
Rym: Anyway, yeah, so, uh passwords like that Don't exist anymore because they've been replaced by DLC Save games.

603
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:17,749
Scott: Yeah.

604
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,260
Scott: Well, there's two different kinds, right?

605
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,579
Scott: I mean, you know Zelda had a battery in it.

606
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,958
Scott: But back in those days having a battery in the cartridge was sort of a big deal, you know It wasn't cheap to do that.

607
00:37:28,481 --> 00:37:41,980
Scott: So games that didn't have a lot of save data or a complicated save couldn't really, you know Make the game cost more money to stick the battery in there with it with the you know Small amount of you know, I guess read write memory

608
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,140
Rym: Seventy dollars for Zelda 2 when it came out and that's in dollars from a long time ago.

609
00:37:48,302 --> 00:38:03,079
Scott: Yeah, so You know event what it was is every other game that didn't have Didn't couldn't cost that much would use a password for the save game and basically when you were typing in the password you were typing in The save game data encoded as text.

610
00:38:03,221 --> 00:38:08,980
Rym: Yeah guys gonna blow your mind If you didn't know this stuff kind of like the MMC chips and all that crazy stuff in Nintendo.

611
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,320
Rym: The password was just you writing down the data.

612
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,530
Rym: It was saving the game to you, right?

613
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:27,214
Rym: And the only way you know You couldn't really cheat and game it too much because a lot of games had pretty good checksumming to where It pretty much had to type in a password the game gave you but some games didn't.

614
00:38:27,796 --> 00:38:30,686
Rym: so remember Kid Icarus How they're like a million passwords.

615
00:38:30,787 --> 00:38:32,996
Rym: Yeah, that's just because the checksumming was so weak.

616
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:33,960
Rym: Maybe it was even non-existent.

617
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,708
Rym: I forget the details.

618
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:38,300
Scott: I'll look it up while we talk It just let you put in anything that was valid almost anything.

619
00:38:38,682 --> 00:38:52,880
Rym: So that's why the most famous password in all of NES history I think is 8 followed by a stream of lowercase u's Yeah, then that made you like invincible and put you at the end of the game with infinite everything.

620
00:38:53,802 --> 00:38:55,656
Scott: It's like the game had its own game genie built in.

621
00:38:57,621 --> 00:39:01,437
Rym: So that's where Icarus fights Medusa Angel or packing packing packing packing.

622
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:01,819
Rym: game from.

623
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,720
Scott: yeah I mean, you know, there's the other kind of cheat code though, which is like Konami code.

624
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:09,816
Scott: Yeah up up down on the left right left right BS like start right?

625
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:15,420
Rym: It's not actually I like how you say the select because people who had friends as kids just say the select they assume it.

626
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,755
Scott: That's right people who didn't?

627
00:39:18,866 --> 00:39:27,759
Rym: It was always this unspoken thing of whenever like we'd all sit down and someone put in Contra Everyone would go silent and whoever held the player one controller just had to do it.

628
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:34,080
Rym: And if it didn't work if you started the game and you didn't have 30 lives, that was the equivalent of a doorknob.

629
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,664
Rym: That Was like.

630
00:39:36,965 --> 00:39:40,800
Rym: that was the faux pas equivalent of in the modern-day cell phone battery runs out.

631
00:39:41,202 --> 00:39:42,730
Rym: I was gonna say your DS light.

632
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:44,078
Rym: No, okay, or I guess 3ds.

633
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:47,387
Rym: Anyway, your battery running out.

634
00:39:47,407 --> 00:39:53,199
Scott: All right, but those codes you're not actually like writing the savegame memory You're just the game has a thing in it.

635
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,247
Scott: Like if someone pushes these buttons do this.

636
00:39:55,688 --> 00:39:58,759
Scott: if someone pushes this do that like NBA Jam and a million of them.

637
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:05,080
Scott: Right, like unlock big head mode unlike mascot head mode unlike, you know, always on fire.

638
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:07,409
Scott: Unlock all this kind of crazy shit.

639
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:09,998
Scott: Yeah, every game goes really fast gingers really slow, you know.

640
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:19,408
Rym: what's interesting is that those really only existed in an era when there wasn't an internet to look them up because they added this sort of Mythology to gaming.

641
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,458
Scott: Well, I think there's a few reasons right.

642
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:22,962
Scott: number one Game.

643
00:40:23,203 --> 00:40:24,729
Scott: game developers would put them in.

644
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,620
Scott: it all started with adventure with the secret room, obviously, right?

645
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:32,195
Scott: But you know game developers would put them in and sort of like to help debug the games.

646
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:35,455
Scott: right even once they got you Know off development machines, right.

647
00:40:35,495 --> 00:40:43,939
Scott: number two They would put them in because then they could sell strategy guides and stuff that told you about them and video game third-party people who sold that shit.

648
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:50,940
Scott: Magazines also Nintendo hotline also, you know and it you know that whole kind of thing going on.

649
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:52,220
Scott: You know Really?

650
00:40:52,340 --> 00:41:00,436
Scott: It was just a way to get people excited about games and to have they basically created information that had some sort of value and then they could extract value from it.

651
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:04,180
Scott: and Three it created this mystique, right?

652
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:12,684
Scott: Mortal Kombat with all like, you know, especially Mortal Kombat 2 with all the babe alities and friendships and people, you know Create all these rumors.

653
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,937
Rym: The kid was always like yeah, if you do the the nakedality, they'll be naked.

654
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:17,800
Rym: then they have sex.

655
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,360
Scott: Yeah, all that stuff came later on when game companies are really just trying to take advantage of it.

656
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,660
Scott: You know NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat 2 are really the biggest ones who did that.

657
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:31,680
Rym: A lot of the earlier ones especially like level skips and stuff probably just came out of easy testing.

658
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:32,884
Scott: Yeah, it's what I'm saying.

659
00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:33,987
Scott: developers.

660
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:34,609
Rym: They were.

661
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,120
Rym: there is sort of advanced, you know people who play the game enough.

662
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,620
Rym: It was basically a way to force someone who bought the game to kind of play through it to a point.

663
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:44,253
Rym: But eventually they look up the cheat code.

664
00:41:44,274 --> 00:41:44,980
Rym: they can skip levels.

665
00:41:45,222 --> 00:41:53,220
Scott: There may have also been a game or two That was basically like hey if we just put these in our game that'll put those freaking game genie assholes out of business.

666
00:41:54,201 --> 00:42:04,040
Rym: Game genie, I remember I was obsessed with game genie because I didn't like I Understood the basics of programming and I understood what the game genie was doing.

667
00:42:04,963 --> 00:42:09,251
Rym: But because it was so poorly Documented and that's partly because there was no good way to document.

668
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:11,540
Scott: game genie themselves wanted to make money from codes.

669
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:12,645
Scott: That was their whole idea.

670
00:42:12,665 --> 00:42:14,533
Scott: It was like hey, we'll sell you a game genie.

671
00:42:14,794 --> 00:42:19,555
Scott: and then well, you know We were publishing these game genie code books for all the new updated games.

672
00:42:19,575 --> 00:42:28,568
Rym: You have to buy those books Yeah, but it was also that you couldn't really predict what they would do because all it would do is change values That were being passed around in the game.

673
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,478
Rym: So like set an integer or something to be a different number.

674
00:42:31,498 --> 00:42:34,217
Rym: Yeah I mean all sorts of bullshit.

675
00:42:34,257 --> 00:42:38,091
Scott: nowadays Emulators have much better tools to help you figure out where like.

676
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:49,951
Scott: for example, if you open up your SNES emulator You can say hey look for the number 254 and tell me if that number changes or like, okay Look at the memory.

677
00:42:49,992 --> 00:42:51,825
Scott: right now I'm gonna do something.

678
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:55,420
Scott: you pick up a coin and it says tell me what changed in the past.

679
00:42:55,581 --> 00:43:02,757
Scott: You know just then and it'll say memory location this just changed and you look at that memory location And it's exactly one higher than what it used to be.

680
00:43:02,777 --> 00:43:04,879
Scott: and you say aha That's where it keeps the coins.

681
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:15,790
Scott: so you then type in a new value for how many coins and you notice links money just goes And your wallet fills up and you're like gotcha All right, so you had a game genie didn't have tools like that.

682
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,400
Scott: You just didn't know the memory in the game.

683
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:26,640
Scott: So only like the game genie people would like, you know Like attached debug tools to the NES and like examine the memory state, you know.

684
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:32,140
Rym: and because they gave instructions in the back of one of the game genie books that talked about like.

685
00:43:32,622 --> 00:43:38,317
Rym: So this dump they'd be like F is more powerful than a. yeah like for real.

686
00:43:39,604 --> 00:43:40,554
Rym: So I just said they're fucking.

687
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:41,160
Rym: I found this page.

688
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:41,822
Rym: I'll link to that.

689
00:43:42,224 --> 00:43:46,037
Rym: Yeah on the last two digits are the checksum and it's really simple.

690
00:43:46,077 --> 00:43:46,660
Rym: and get Icarus.

691
00:43:47,342 --> 00:43:50,998
Rym: This guy breaks down how the passwords work pretty pretty deeply.

692
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:58,150
Rym: Yep So what's more interesting is that as a kid for some reason a lot of people?

693
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,705
Rym: I knew had a lot of trouble with passwords like they could not write them down.

694
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:03,970
Scott: They couldn't write them down.

695
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:08,070
Scott: I mean, sometimes you can't remember him if they're complicated but can't write them down.

696
00:44:08,492 --> 00:44:14,329
Rym: I think a lot of us maybe they're younger kids like or if they write them down But then they don't remember if it was a one or an L or an I.

697
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:16,127
Scott: What the fuck is wrong with you?

698
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:20,424
Scott: You had really awful password said to keep writing down and they sucked.

699
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:22,070
Rym: I think Metal Gear was the worst metal.

700
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:31,295
Rym: It was pretty bad because Metal Gear on re-inputting them You couldn't backspace so you'd be and you're like moving around like a click click click click click click click click click one Click click click up fuck.

701
00:44:31,516 --> 00:44:33,263
Rym: and you just got to start over like reset the game.

702
00:44:33,283 --> 00:44:36,132
Scott: Mega Man 2 had a good one with the grid Right.

703
00:44:36,192 --> 00:44:38,684
Scott: The grid was Mega Man always had clever ways of entering the password.

704
00:44:38,704 --> 00:44:42,661
Scott: The grid was cool in one way But it was really easy to enter and really easy to remember.

705
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:44,810
Rym: Yeah, but I had to like draw it if it was complicated.

706
00:44:45,492 --> 00:44:47,317
Scott: Yeah, you just write down like A3, B4.

707
00:44:47,377 --> 00:44:50,586
Scott: You didn't need to write, you know, draw a picture of it.

708
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:52,312
Rym: Even A3, A4 That's that's.

709
00:44:52,854 --> 00:44:56,390
Rym: I think that is more difficult than just typing a string.

710
00:44:56,571 --> 00:44:59,170
Scott: What like you got to remember eight battleship locations?

711
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,374
Rym: The thing is you don't remember anything.

712
00:45:00,394 --> 00:45:04,009
Rym: you write it down and I can write down one five four five five five five and just remember it.

713
00:45:04,694 --> 00:45:06,790
Scott: Anyway, I like the Mega Man system.

714
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:18,430
Rym: it was a. The trouble I had with it Really was that I remembered the way to give myself a shit ton of e-tanks and I pretty much always do that.

715
00:45:18,891 --> 00:45:22,643
Rym: Okay, because I sucked at Mega Man and had I not just remembered that password.

716
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:23,385
Rym: It was so easy.

717
00:45:23,405 --> 00:45:27,198
Rym: I might have Gotten better at Mega Man when I was younger.

718
00:45:27,539 --> 00:45:30,289
Scott: See every Mega Man password I had I got.

719
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:36,623
Rym: so Yeah, no, I would just get him from like, you know, it's like.

720
00:45:36,663 --> 00:45:39,211
Scott: yeah, I had a password for startup Dr.

721
00:45:39,252 --> 00:45:40,537
Scott: Wily's level with four e-tanks.

722
00:45:40,617 --> 00:45:42,184
Scott: cuz I got to the start of dr.

723
00:45:42,204 --> 00:45:47,268
Scott: Wily's level with four e-tanks And then I kept using that until I beat the game.

724
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:48,714
Rym: It's weird.

725
00:45:48,754 --> 00:45:53,363
Rym: Oh some games I would cheat in and some games I would like Contras always cheat because I couldn't play that game for shit.

726
00:45:53,403 --> 00:46:00,281
Rym: Otherwise, but like I don't think we gave I didn't cheat in Gorilla war you could continue forever.

727
00:46:00,784 --> 00:46:01,930
Rym: So it didn't really matter.

728
00:46:02,615 --> 00:46:04,450
Rym: But at the same time you can hit like a B up.

729
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,269
Rym: I forget what it was.

730
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:10,330
Rym: But if you hit something like that, it would just bring you back in without having to actually mean Akari warriors a BBA.

731
00:46:11,372 --> 00:46:12,297
Rym: It might have been that in.

732
00:46:12,377 --> 00:46:16,238
Rym: I don't know if it's actually the same or not in Gorilla war because they're not the same game.

733
00:46:16,298 --> 00:46:20,258
Scott: No, but Akari warriors was every time you die I press a BBA and you keep playing.

734
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:22,950
Scott: Yep, because there's fuck up you go you kill yourself.

735
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:26,363
Rym: I don't know if there's any way in real life to beat that game without cheating.

736
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:26,764
Scott: There isn't?

737
00:46:27,447 --> 00:46:30,050
Scott: it's an arcade game Where you're meant to just die constantly.

738
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:35,170
Rym: It's interesting that when that like when Gorilla war got ported to the NES they didn't make it any easier.

739
00:46:41,273 --> 00:46:43,810
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

740
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:48,690
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

741
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:50,898
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

742
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:53,930
