1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,615
Rym: It's Monday, March 11th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:11,898
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:13,221
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:16,810
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, everyday technology.

5
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,208
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:27,161
Rym: So, over the weekend, I come home from a thing like a do.

7
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:30,630
Rym: Actually, I went to see Wolf Children, Morosna's new movie.

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,371
Scott: Wolf Children?

9
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:32,716
Scott: It is... Did they bite you?

10
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,345
Rym: No, it is the best.

11
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:36,750
Rym: It is so good.

12
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:42,009
Rym: But, and also, the main reason it was great, not the main reason, but eight reasons.

13
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:42,310
Scott: it was great.

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,178
Scott: Didn't you save this for Wednesday?

15
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:44,349
Rym: No, no, I'm just saying he was there.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,577
Scott: We do have a Wednesday show this week.

17
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:46,665
Rym: I know, I'm just saying he was there.

18
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:47,410
Scott: We've seen him before.

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,399
Rym: And the kids, you know, ask questions or whatever.

20
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:50,961
Scott: Just like last time.

21
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:53,250
Rym: And the first kid question was the best question ever.

22
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,638
Rym: He was like, "Why did you make the movie so

23
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:56,581
Rym: depressing?".

24
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:59,170
Rym: And his answer was great.

25
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,069
Rym: He was basically, "Well, you know, it's not really depressing if you're older when you watch it.

26
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:07,788
Rym: So watch it again when you're older, and you'll see what your parents went through raising

27
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:07,929
Rym: you.".

28
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:16,150
Rym: But, so I come home from all that, and there's an official notice on the door to the entrance of my building.

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,776
Scott: I saw this notice when I came in.

30
00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:21,710
Rym: Because it's still there, and there's some law about how many weeks they have to leave it publicly noticed.

31
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:24,059
Rym: It's duct taped to the window.

32
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,269
Rym: And when I came home, I start reading it.

33
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:35,909
Rym: And my first thought, because if you read it, until you get to the point where it only affects the stellar, it's basically the notice of everyone in this building's got to get the fuck out.

34
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,960
Rym: So I'm reading it going, "Ah, fuck me.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,804
Rym: There goes my week.

36
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:40,266
Rym: Oh,

37
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:40,627
Rym: cellar.".

38
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,241
Rym: So, basically, I read this thing.

39
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:46,710
Rym: I took a picture of it, you know, just because.

40
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:51,310
Rym: And then I walked inside, and I went down to the cellar, and I looked at the thing it was referring to.

41
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,500
Rym: And sure enough, there's two things down there.

42
00:01:55,342 --> 00:02:00,609
Rym: And there's a bunch of, and I hate to sound stereotypical, but there's a bunch of Mexican people moving out in a hurry.

43
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:12,058
Rym: So my building basically had two illegal apartments in the cellar that were really big, relatively nice apartments, very similarly set up to my apartment.

44
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,924
Rym: But they were in the cellar.

45
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:16,170
Rym: And they were totally illegal.

46
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,517
Scott: Now, it's not clear if- Now, usually when a building is built, and this building is kind of new- This building's brand new.

47
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:24,150
Rym: We're the first people to live in our apartment.

48
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,810
Scott: The inspectors come and make sure the building is legit.

49
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:31,990
Scott: So was those apartments not there when the inspectors came and the building was built?

50
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,450
Rym: So when I moved, we moved in almost exactly a year after the building was built.

51
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,870
Rym: It hadn't been fully occupied ever at that point.

52
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:44,737
Rym: So I remember the first day when we moved in, I walked down to the cellar, just because, you know, you do.

53
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:46,570
Rym: You poke around the building and see what's what.

54
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,441
Rym: And down there, there's a crazy boiler room.

55
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:51,089
Rym: There's a bunch of machine rooms.

56
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,318
Rym: There's a trash room and all this crazy stuff.

57
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,030
Rym: And actually, there's a lot of big stuff because it's a big building.

58
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,930
Rym: And there's, like, the emergency egress hatches in case you need to get out from the exploding boiler or whatever.

59
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,877
Rym: And there's a door.

60
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:06,070
Rym: There's a white door that's always open.

61
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:09,370
Rym: Behind that, it was just a little, like, sort of antechamber.

62
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:14,527
Rym: And then beyond that, there were two apartments, just 0A and 0B.

63
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:18,474
Rym: Like, apartment 0 and 0.

64
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,050
Rym: And I never really thought much of it.

65
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:27,929
Scott: And then from the back of the building- Wait, 0A and 0B, wouldn't they be- I mean, there's an A. A is the second floor.

66
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:28,656
Scott: What?

67
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:28,720
Scott: No.

68
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,761
Rym: The A, B, C is just on each floor.

69
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:34,590
Rym: There's an A, B, C, D, E, F, G, whatever.

70
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:35,665
Scott: Oh, it's like that.

71
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:35,726
Scott: OK.

72
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,876
Rym: That's how my building is.

73
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:39,010
Rym: What do you think the A is on our apartment?

74
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,749
Scott: I thought that the next one was, you know, A, whatever.

75
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,590
Rym: So you thought I live on the eighth floor of the building?

76
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:50,162
Rym: Anyway.

77
00:03:51,232 --> 00:04:02,450
Rym: So yeah, either the building company just fucking put these illegal apartments straight up in the blueprint of the building, or- And how did they get away with that, putting them in the blueprints?

78
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:19,690
Rym: Or the blueprint of the building just had this area with two apartment-sized rooms that were designated to not be apartments, and then someone decided to turn them into apartments that look just like apartments in all the other parts of the building.

79
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:26,170
Rym: So I'm not sure how deeply I'll follow it, but I'm going to try to figure out what actually happened.

80
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,070
Rym: But when I walked down there, there were straight up a bunch of Mexican people moving out in a hurry.

81
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,996
Scott: Are you sure they were Mexican?

82
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:33,870
Scott: They could have been some other variety of people.

83
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,613
Rym: I'm pretty confident.

84
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:47,109
Rym: they were Mexican because I work actually heavily in Latin America, and I can actually kind of tell the difference between, like, Colombians and Puerto Ricans and Mexicans and Argentinians, just because I do a lot of business with them.

85
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:49,150
Rym: I can tell by the accent particularly.

86
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:59,467
Rym: But yeah, they were Mexicans, and they were moving out in a hurry, and I don't know what's going on, but I went down there, and there's crazy eviction notices on the doors.

87
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:01,928
Rym: that's basically like, "If you come in here, you'll be fucking

88
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:02,150
Rym: arrested.".

89
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:06,129
Rym: I guess the building inspector showed up.

90
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,115
Rym: I feel bad for those people.

91
00:05:08,255 --> 00:05:12,670
Rym: I don't know if they were in on it, or if they got scammed by whoever put those apartments there.

92
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:23,770
Rym: But what's funny is it was like, one of the reasons they can't live down there is poor ventilation, poor lighting, illegally installed gas line, which I'm not super happy about.

93
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:29,850
Rym: And you know, it's funny, when I tried to buy that house in Beacon, it had an illegally installed gas line.

94
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,770
Scott: What is up with these illegally installed gas lines?

95
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:37,170
Rym: And it had an illegally installed kitchen, and an illegally installed fifth and sixth bedroom.

96
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:40,189
Scott: What the fuck is up with this shit?

97
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,470
Rym: That's just how it goes.

98
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:56,150
Scott: If I ever get a building, if I ever had to build a building of any kind, I'm going to make the person doing the building in a contract accept all liability that the thing is 100% legal, and if it's not, they're going to pay to make it legal.

99
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,394
Rym: Yeah, you know what's going to happen?

100
00:05:57,415 --> 00:06:00,229
Rym: You're basically not going to find anyone who will do the contract work for you.

101
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,509
Scott: I'm going to have to pay to find someone who will make sure that everything they do is legal.

102
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,789
Rym: They'll have some sort of bonded insurance, and they'll take care of it.

103
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,130
Rym: Yeah, so now I'm watching this crazy thing unfold, and it seems to have mostly unfolded.

104
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,290
Scott: I'm also going to call the inspector, whoever it is, to be like, "Hey, I'm having some shit done.

105
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,068
Scott: I want to make sure it's legal before it's fucking

106
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:18,189
Scott: done.".

107
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,749
Rym: So when I got the inspection of that house I was going to build, right?

108
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:30,530
Rym: The guy's walking around, and he looks at the kitchen, and he's like, "Yeah, this is totally, I'm going to bet you money that there is no permit for all the work that was done here.

109
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,764
Rym: This isn't a multi-family

110
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:32,210
Rym: dwelling.".

111
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:34,449
Rym: And he was very honest about it, but he was like, "Tell you what.

112
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:51,890
Rym: If and when you buy this house, if you want to keep it, let me know, and I'll draw up blueprints for the planned work you expect to do, and then you can get them approved, and then you can have them come and inspect the completed work after a reasonable interval.

113
00:06:52,471 --> 00:07:02,407
Rym: Or you can have me draw up the blueprints of what you want it to look like after it's fixed, and we can arrange that the inspections happen after it is actually

114
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:02,749
Rym: fixed.".

115
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:06,590
Rym: And he was pretty open about how much it would cost to do those two things.

116
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,889
Scott: That's just fun.

117
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,235
Rym: That building had a much more egregious thing.

118
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:14,670
Rym: It had a sliding glass door on the second floor to nowhere.

119
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,970
Scott: As in you slide it open, walk out and die?

120
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,385
Scott: Yes.

121
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:18,930
Scott: Or at least break your leg?

122
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:27,430
Rym: And it was a story and a half up, because it was a bi-level, and it was kind of situated on a hill, and basically there was a deck that either never got built or had to be torn down.

123
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,709
Scott: So there should have been a deck outside of that door, but instead it was just nothing?

124
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:39,510
Rym: And it was like 20 feet up, and there was a corrugated steel shanty town shed next to the house.

125
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:41,550
Scott: Directly underneath the sliding door?

126
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,370
Rym: No, that was actually off to the side.

127
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,430
Scott: Why don't you just put the pool underneath that sliding door, and then you're all set?

128
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:58,670
Rym: So yeah, the rules around having pools installed in suburbia means that you never want a pool installed, because if a random kid breaks into your property and drowns in the pool, you're at fault.

129
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:07,210
Scott: That's why I will have a system by which anyone walking onto the property gets shot, because then that will make me less liable.

130
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,206
Scott: Yeah, Scott, New York State law has a specific rule against so-called

131
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,050
Scott: "mantraps."

132
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,770
Scott: I'm pretty sure the whole country has a law against mantraps, but then is the pool not a mantrap?

133
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:19,130
Rym: Is everything not a mantrap?

134
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,890
Scott: I mean, it's basically a water filled- It's not life, but a mantrap.

135
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,950
Scott: It's basically a water filled, piranha filled pit trap, right?

136
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,348
Scott: In a way.

137
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,970
Rym: In a way, aren't we all mantraps?

138
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,903
Scott: And if I drain it for the winter, isn't it just a pit?

139
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,530
Scott: A pit is a trap.

140
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,145
Rym: I mean, it's the most basic trap.

141
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:43,669
Rym: A pit is only a trap if you're trying to catch tigers or adventurers in a 10 foot by 10 foot configuration.

142
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,018
Scott: Come on, and then what do you do in the winter to that pit?

143
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,770
Scott: You put a concealing tarp over the top of it.

144
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:50,290
Scott: How is that not a trap?

145
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,210
Rym: When I was a kid on the beach one time, here's some technology.

146
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,890
Rym: I made a possibly lethal mantrap with a bunch of neighborhood kids in Lexington.

147
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,795
Scott: I have done this in a playground once.

148
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:05,050
Scott: I took a bunch of sticks that I found and I dig a hole and I put the sticks face up in the hole.

149
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,210
Rym: Whoa, that's way worse than what I did.

150
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,779
Scott: And then I stepped in it and went, "Ow,".

151
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,570
Scott: and then I got rid of it because I hurt myself in my own trap.

152
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,177
Rym: Okay, mine was better and worse.

153
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:17,110
Rym: We basically took some sticks, we dug a deep hole.

154
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,110
Scott: It's not like I sharpened the sticks, they were just sticks.

155
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:28,490
Rym: We dug a deep hole, like really deep, and then we covered it with sticks, we covered those sticks with fronds, we covered those fronds with leaves, we covered those leaves with sand.

156
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,601
Rym: Then we went home and we told our parents, and my dad was like, "That is awesome.

157
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:36,808
Rym: Now you're going to go dig it up before someone

158
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:37,269
Rym: dies.".

159
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:38,889
Scott: How deep was this pit?

160
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:40,210
Rym: Like five feet.

161
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,730
Scott: That's not, no one's going to die in that.

162
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,150
Rym: If you suddenly fell into a five foot pit, you might severely hurt yourself, and if the tide then came in...

163
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,329
Scott: You wouldn't die if you left out the essential pointy sticks face up.

164
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,288
Rym: So I learned you don't actually face them up, you face them at an angle inward, anyway.

165
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,910
Scott: That's porcupine style.

166
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,389
Rym: That's not porcupine style, there's a specific name for that.

167
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,849
Rym: Now if you poop on it, it's I think a punchy stick?

168
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,190
Scott: I'm going to look that up.

169
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:06,810
Scott: That's going to give someone an infection.

170
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,010
Rym: I learned about that in middle school, anyway.

171
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,068
Scott: I think it's called a poop-dibber.

172
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:12,815
Rym: Anyway, you got any news.

173
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:15,610
Rym: when I look up if this is a thing or if I just made it up from my childhood?

174
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:17,430
Scott: I actually don't have news.

175
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,268
Rym: No news?

176
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,890
Rym: Yep, yep, it is punchy stick.

177
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,290
Rym: So that fuck-filled, oh my god, there's, okay, anyway.

178
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,189
Rym: Don't Google image search that.

179
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,509
Rym: Yeah, poop on a stick, people step on it, they get sepsis.

180
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:33,910
Scott: Yeah, that's what'll happen, sure.

181
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:41,330
Rym: Yeah, I learned that in middle school, we had to pick a novel from this box of novels that our teacher had in like sixth grade.

182
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:51,430
Rym: So I fish around, I find this fuck-violent, crazy Vietnam trash novel that I don't know if it was there by design or by accident.

183
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,750
Rym: But good god, it was that 500 pages of the word fuck, and that's where I learned about punchy sticks.

184
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:06,810
Scott: Okay, so I don't have a tech news, but I do have something that our listeners say they enjoy, at least some of them say they enjoy, which is esoteric, really advanced technology bullshit.

185
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:24,729
Scott: So at work, right, got this problem, there's a thing called PyPy, it's the place where you get your packages from the cheese shop, because, you know, Python the language, Monty Python, the cheese shop, where you get your packages, right?

186
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:32,010
Scott: So the first one of these, at least that I know of, right, was called CPAN, which is still around, it's for Perl.

187
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:38,889
Scott: So if you program in Perl and you need to get a helping library, maybe you want to work with SSL.

188
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:53,650
Scott: So what you would do is you would do like CPAN something something and the name of the SSL library, and then your computer will go out to CPAN, find the SSL library, and then install it so that now when you load Perl, you can now use that library.

189
00:11:54,411 --> 00:12:08,210
Scott: So for Python, this package, you know, repository is called PyPy, and it's notoriously sort of slow and unreliable compared to, say, CPAN and the others, which are much better in those regards, right?

190
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:17,033
Scott: So there's a few mirrors, but not many, there's an art, there was a mirror at RIT, apparently hasn't been updated in a very long time, it's way out of date, right?

191
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:25,510
Scott: So we had a problem at work where trying to access this, you know, PyPy was like timing out, it wasn't working.

192
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:29,650
Scott: So I tried to install something from Amazon and it was working just fine.

193
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:36,230
Scott: So the connection between work and PyPy was not good, but the connection between Amazon and PyPy was just fine.

194
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,234
Scott: So I'm like, what can I do about this?

195
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:44,810
Scott: Aha, I will create my own private mirror of PyPy, right, on Amazon.

196
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:45,875
Scott: It doesn't cost that much.

197
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,060
Scott: It costs like 50 cents a month.

198
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,430
Scott: It'll just take a long time to download the whole thing, right?

199
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:57,430
Scott: And then when I'm at work, I can install things from our own private copy that I know I can keep up, right, even if the real PyPy goes down.

200
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:59,935
Scott: OK, so I find how you do this.

201
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:07,570
Scott: First, you have to install something from PyPy and then you run it and it starts to make a mirror of the original PyPy and then you're all set.

202
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:15,510
Scott: So I'm running this and I let it go over the weekend and I come into work this morning and it says error or something.

203
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,252
Scott: Something.

204
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:20,386
Scott: HTTP response, bad, bad response, evil.

205
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:21,590
Scott: And I'm like, what the fuck?

206
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,072
Scott: This thing is so broken.

207
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:23,373
Scott: You can't.

208
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:30,910
Scott: And then I go searching online and there was I saw the funniest thing, which was a Google groups post and a guy was like our news group post.

209
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:36,886
Scott: And the guy was like, I was running Mirror D and I got this error after a long time.

210
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,210
Scott: I couldn't figure out how to fix it.

211
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,239
Scott: So I'm just not going to run Mirror D anymore.

212
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,489
Scott: And I'm like, well, that's where all those mirrors went to.

213
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:50,890
Scott: So then I found in Bitbucket there was actually a patch to make it work again.

214
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:56,270
Scott: So I manually applied this patch to the mirror making thing and then started it up again.

215
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:00,535
Scott: This is really a fucking problem.

216
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:08,890
Scott: These PyPy people got to get their shit together because none of the other programming languages have this problem with their repositories.

217
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:19,230
Rym: I've seen the opposite problem of a lot of people who want to write code in Perl have no idea how to get Perl modules.

218
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:23,797
Rym: They can't even figure out how to get them.

219
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:32,030
Rym: And that's why you'll see so many people post just raw Perl code in a forum and people just take it and copy paste it into their Perl script.

220
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,416
Scott: I actually don't blame those people entirely, right?

221
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:39,650
Scott: Because the fact is when I was you know, I had a degree in computer science, right?

222
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,350
Scott: The two things they never taught you at all in four years.

223
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,589
Rym: Oh, because I can tell you the things they never teach you in IT.

224
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:48,516
Scott: RIT, computer science education.

225
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:49,980
Scott: Number one, they don't teach you.

226
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,090
Scott: They didn't teach us anything at all about the Web.

227
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,830
Scott: The only reason I knew how to make websites is because in high school, I did HTML on my fucking own middle school also.

228
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,171
Scott: Right.

229
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:01,540
Scott: They did not teach you anything about the Web at all.

230
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:03,927
Scott: Zero in college.

231
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:04,709
Scott: None.

232
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,130
Scott: Right.

233
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,401
Scott: Which is the number one way to make money these days.

234
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:07,963
Rym: Just the Web.

235
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:09,370
Rym: or how about networking in general?

236
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,848
Scott: Well, I mean, I took networking classes on purpose, but yeah, I think maybe one was required.

237
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:15,310
Scott: I'm not sure.

238
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:15,650
Scott: Anyway.

239
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:17,252
Scott: And number two.

240
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:18,113
Scott: Right.

241
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:34,530
Scott: They teach you how to program in the language, but they don't teach you anything about, you know, development environments and, you know, setting up all that other stuff around the actual type, you know, typing of the code and knowing how the code works.

242
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:39,570
Scott: It's like they don't tell you how to go, you know, get a library, install it and use it.

243
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,131
Scott: Right.

244
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:42,818
Scott: You know, it's like, you know, that's it.

245
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:47,790
Scott: It's like if you're learning C, they they're like, oh, you just include Iostream and that's it.

246
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,283
Scott: They don't tell you how to go and get, say, you know, libXML and start using that.

247
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:53,747
Scott: They tell you how to write an XML parse.

248
00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:00,647
Rym: What's interesting is I see just people I talk to or hire or interview from non-RIT schools.

249
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:01,650
Rym: It's the opposite.

250
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,950
Rym: That's the stuff they learn, but they don't learn the actual core fundamentals of program.

251
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:08,375
Scott: Well, you need to learn both.

252
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:08,736
Scott: You need to.

253
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:12,530
Scott: you need to know how to program so that you could perhaps write your own library.

254
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:22,230
Scott: But you also need to know how to go and get other people's code and then use it yourself and reuse it and install and get and do and such and such.

255
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,475
Rym: Well, I've seen that, you know, and IT was kind of the same thing.

256
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:29,830
Rym: Like they would teach you how DNS works, like what DNS was and how it worked.

257
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:34,229
Rym: But they would not tell you anything about what demon it was or how to run it.

258
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,334
Scott: Yeah, it's like what is bind?

259
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:37,978
Scott: There's a thing called bind.

260
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:39,522
Scott: You apt-get install bind.

261
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:41,206
Scott: The config files are here.

262
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:42,810
Scott: You edit them like this.

263
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:44,508
Scott: You restart it like this.

264
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,062
Rym: So what about name-d?

265
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:46,469
Rym: What's that?

266
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,430
Scott: It's just an alternative.

267
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:49,011
Rym: Yeah.

268
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:50,161
Rym: So why would you use one over the other?

269
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,170
Rym: Where do you get either one?

270
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,510
Scott: Bind is like the do everything one and name-d.

271
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,630
Rym: We're running Red Hat Bullshit Edition just because that's what's in the lab.

272
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:58,509
Scott: Well, what year is it from?

273
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:01,630
Scott: 2002? 2001?

274
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:09,790
Scott: Well, any any DNS that's, you know, comes with that in the on the CD or whatever is probably way out of date and insecure.

275
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:13,249
Scott: So what you need to do is you need to go get the source code for the modern one.

276
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,010
Rym: It's not going to help these people.

277
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:20,150
Scott: The new version from the Internet and then compile it using the C stack.

278
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:28,690
Rym: So in general, in IT, Red Hat, they did not teach anyone even the barest hints of how to use Linux.

279
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:36,630
Scott: You know, I took it was assumed a handful of IT classes that taught me bullshit that I already knew.

280
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,944
Scott: Yeah, but they were pretty much how to use Linux.

281
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:41,390
Scott: I had to write like some shell scripts.

282
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,202
Rym: And then you take OS scripting.

283
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:44,030
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

284
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,869
Rym: OS scripting is the guy's bash said awk.

285
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,215
Scott: Yeah, I took that class.

286
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,469
Rym: That class assumed you already fucking knew how to, you know, log in.

287
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,490
Scott: I knew all three of those things before.

288
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:54,806
Rym: And why did you take that class?

289
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,015
Scott: Because easy credits.

290
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,770
Scott: How do you think I fucking graduated failing calculus three, three times?

291
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,589
Rym: I took that class when I was a freshman because it was a required class.

292
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,942
Rym: Maybe I took it as a sophomore.

293
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:05,509
Rym: I don't remember.

294
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,301
Scott: It's also because I for my.

295
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,710
Rym: That was the class where the two cool kids were those of us who would type start X when we got there and have a GUI.

296
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,841
Rym: Anyway, all their kids would be like, how do you do that?

297
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:18,310
Rym: I was like, you're not going to graduate.

298
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:22,002
Scott: Because I chose a non C.S.

299
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,490
Scott: concentration of security.

300
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,367
Scott: And basically there were these two I.T.

301
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:26,710
Scott: security.

302
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:27,877
Rym: Talk about I.T.

303
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:29,690
Scott: security, which are useless, by the way.

304
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,555
Rym: Yeah, I took the I.T.

305
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,630
Scott: security, but I chose that when I was a freshman.

306
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:37,630
Scott: And then the thing is, the prerequisites for those classes were things such as OS scripting.

307
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:38,936
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

308
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:41,030
Rym: I took that security class and it was garbage.

309
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:45,710
Rym: I decided to not pursue the security sort of concentration stuff at RIT.

310
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:52,110
Scott: Well, I had to choose this as a freshman and then it was already kind of what I had to pay to take other classes to change it up.

311
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,370
Rym: I changed it up because I had so many extra credits.

312
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:54,953
Rym: It didn't matter.

313
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:57,730
Rym: But so, yeah, they did.

314
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:08,690
Rym: So that class, when they talk about compilation, that one of the lab part was basically here are secure servers and here are servers that students set up.

315
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:11,589
Rym: You've got to try to hack into both of them and document what you do.

316
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:12,554
Rym: You know what?

317
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:15,770
Rym: They don't actually teach you anything about hacking.

318
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,439
Scott: They didn't teach us one thing at all in that class.

319
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:21,169
Scott: I had the same class and they didn't tell us what to do.

320
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,729
Scott: It's like you just sort of had to do it on your own.

321
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,194
Rym: Yeah, so you know what most kids did?

322
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:28,928
Rym: They infected themselves with viruses because they'd go online and be like,

323
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:31,032
Rym: "I.E.S.,

324
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:37,829
Rym: crack, hack," and they'd find some Windows program that would purport to hack an I.I.S.

325
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:38,210
Rym: server.

326
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,110
Rym: And then it would just proceed to destroy their own computer.

327
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,450
Scott: Yeah, the real problem I had in that class is what I did is I just went and looked.

328
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:51,570
Scott: What I did in that class is I went to the Windows updates and I saw that there was a, you know, a recent fix, a recent patch.

329
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,309
Scott: So I said, "Aha, I will go get the proof of concept exploit for that patch that was just made

330
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:56,590
Scott: today.".

331
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:59,050
Scott: I know they haven't fucking updated those dumbasses, right?

332
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,749
Scott: And I knew that they were using old ass Windows also.

333
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:03,865
Scott: The rule was they had to have a Windows 98 machine.

334
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:05,582
Scott: So I was like, "Ah, ha, ha,

335
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:05,845
Scott: ha.".

336
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:13,770
Scott: So I went and I downloaded the source code for the, you know, it was an MSN messenger thingy, right?

337
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:24,427
Scott: So all I had to do, and I even tested this on, I basically made a fresh computer, installed Windows 98 on it from the image, and then hit that computer and then I was going to repeat the process and it worked.

338
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:25,050
Scott: It totally worked.

339
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:34,630
Scott: All I had to do was run MSN messenger and then like open this file and then basically it would open up a root command terminal on that machine.

340
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,789
Scott: It was the easiest thing in the world.

341
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:43,210
Scott: So I went to the Windows 98 machine that I was only allowed to attack one of the other groups, not all of them.

342
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:47,530
Scott: So I went to their only Windows 98 machine, which was a virtual machine, right?

343
00:20:48,231 --> 00:21:03,849
Scott: And what they had done is they had disabled every single, the execution rights from the user that we could log in as to every single executable file in the entire file system except for the, you know, extremely small handful that they were forced not to.

344
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:07,368
Scott: And it's like, well, I can't run MSN messenger.

345
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:17,350
Rym: And the worst part is, the first thing I thought, as every smart person thinks, and this is the old saying, amateurs attack technology, professionals attack people.

346
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:20,930
Rym: I was just going to fucking go walk in and get physical access.

347
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,632
Scott: We weren't.

348
00:21:21,652 --> 00:21:24,170
Scott: We also were not allowed to use physical access specifically.

349
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,260
Rym: We were told specifically that it wasn't a joke.

350
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,490
Rym: The rule is you can't go attack them physically.

351
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:33,430
Scott: As soon as before they said that, I was like, I'm going to home to get my crowbar.

352
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,470
Scott: I'm going to come back within an hour and get an A in this class so easily.

353
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:38,640
Rym: And they were like, no, don't do it.

354
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,610
Rym: Seriously, don't do it.

355
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,675
Rym: Me saying don't do it isn't a test.

356
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:49,430
Scott: And it's not like I was going to be able to fool other students in the same class who were on the lookout on purpose.

357
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,432
Scott: Right.

358
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:54,469
Scott: It's like and who, you know, really, they should make people just have normal.

359
00:21:55,051 --> 00:22:00,350
Scott: You know, it's like everyone locked everything down to the point where they were just useless computers that couldn't do anything.

360
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:00,631
Scott: Right.

361
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:03,223
Scott: Because they were anticipating what the class was.

362
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:04,650
Scott: You can't possibly learn anything.

363
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:14,610
Scott: They should just force people to install default windows, all the updates, and then, you know, install a whole bunch of programs and then not be able to change anything on those user machines.

364
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:15,955
Rym: I'd make it a little more clever.

365
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:16,557
Rym: It'd be a race.

366
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:19,970
Rym: Like you have to run all these computers and make them do a bunch of stuff.

367
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:25,069
Rym: And your grade is if you can get them to do that stuff, despite people attacking you.

368
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:27,555
Rym: They also told us not to.

369
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:28,358
Scott: It was a very bad class.

370
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:31,350
Rym: They also told us not to DDoS the servers down, which was my go to.

371
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,153
Scott: So, yeah, it's like that's another thing.

372
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:41,010
Scott: I found another exploit that was pretty much a, you know, if you DDoS this thing, then you can actually get root off of that.

373
00:22:41,713 --> 00:22:41,954
Scott: Right.

374
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:45,570
Scott: And I was like, well, how many computers in this lab can I provision?

375
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,595
Rym: But basically all the exercises came down to.

376
00:22:50,376 --> 00:23:00,410
Rym: you either need to be a programmer to take this exploit and write code to use it, or you need to be a script kitty and go find something online, which is just going to compromise you and it.

377
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,909
Rym: It was a useless class.

378
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,452
Scott: It was.

379
00:23:02,956 --> 00:23:03,581
Scott: Yeah, not good.

380
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:04,106
Scott: Yeah.

381
00:23:04,408 --> 00:23:04,610
Scott: Anyway.

382
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:20,150
Rym: Things of the day, I forgot this game existed until very recently when I was a kid, an adult friend of my dad's gave me a whole bunch of pirated games.

383
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,750
Scott: So did everybody.

384
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:22,554
Rym: Yep.

385
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:24,450
Rym: Because, you know, when I think back and I had my computer.

386
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,570
Scott: First time I saw Wolfenstein 3D was a similar situation.

387
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,570
Rym: The first games I ever got were pirated and I didn't even realize that was a thing.

388
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,862
Rym: People were just like, oh, you want to try this game?

389
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:34,686
Rym: Here's a bunch of floppies.

390
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:35,290
Rym: I was like, thanks.

391
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,840
Scott: Yeah.

392
00:23:36,252 --> 00:23:37,008
Rym: I didn't even think.

393
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:38,189
Scott: I didn't even know.

394
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:44,104
Rym: So one of the games he gave me was called Life and Death from 1988.

395
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:46,370
Rym: I was obsessed with this game.

396
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:58,670
Rym: This game is a disturbingly realistic simulator of hospital procedure, examination and surgery centering on the lower abdomen.

397
00:23:59,412 --> 00:24:00,230
Rym: Only the lower abdomen?

398
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:00,611
Rym: Yes.

399
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,445
Rym: You can.

400
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:06,550
Rym: So you can poke the patients and they'll, you know, go, ah, or not say anything.

401
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,373
Rym: You can tickle them.

402
00:24:07,715 --> 00:24:09,000
Rym: You can get ultrasounds.

403
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:10,204
Rym: You can get X-rays.

404
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:11,650
Rym: You can prescribe medication.

405
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:14,056
Rym: And there's a bunch of things that can be wrong with people.

406
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:18,610
Rym: They can have a lower respiratory or a lower abdominal infection of some kind.

407
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:20,198
Rym: They could have appendicitis.

408
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,567
Rym: They could have all these things.

409
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:21,930
Rym: Gas.

410
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:24,879
Rym: And you just had to be a doctor.

411
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:26,850
Rym: It was super realistic and super tedious.

412
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,690
Rym: If you think that these modern DS games of surgery are hard, play this fucking game.

413
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,128
Scott: Good God.

414
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:39,930
Rym: What I present to you is a speed run of a person performing an appendectomy.

415
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,770
Scott: Is it computer assisted or legit?

416
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:42,362
Rym: It looks legit.

417
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,350
Rym: I never got the farthest I ever got.

418
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,610
Scott: Just cut them open and they die?

419
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:51,005
Rym: No, I figured out how to get the gas going.

420
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,670
Rym: And I figured out when to inject them with atropine and all that stuff.

421
00:24:55,031 --> 00:24:56,190
Rym: And, you know, how to stop bleeding.

422
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,068
Rym: The point where I always fuck up is when you get the periodontinum.

423
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:02,008
Scott: Great.

424
00:25:04,174 --> 00:25:05,230
Scott: I'm glad you're not a doctor.

425
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,920
Rym: The peritoneum, as Emily corrected me.

426
00:25:12,463 --> 00:25:13,347
Rym: I would always rupture it.

427
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:13,990
Rym: Always.

428
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,829
Scott: Let me look with that.

429
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,835
Rym: And then the patient would die.

430
00:25:15,996 --> 00:25:18,270
Rym: Basically, I would cut their bowels open and they would die.

431
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:19,548
Scott: I'm looking this up.

432
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,410
Rym: Now, there's a way to save them if you fuck that up, which I was never able to do.

433
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,708
Scott: Yeah, I think that's what you're trying to do.

434
00:25:25,631 --> 00:25:27,400
Rym: This game is super hard and this is a speed run.

435
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,510
Rym: You should all watch it and play this game on DOSBox.

436
00:25:32,011 --> 00:25:32,646
Scott: Okay, so...

437
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,490
Rym: Don't forget to do... Oh my god, there's a sequel.

438
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,838
Rym: Life and death 2, the brain.

439
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,552
Scott: Really?

440
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:42,697
Scott: They went straight for the brain?

441
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:45,490
Scott: Wouldn't you think that level 2 would be like upper abdomen?

442
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,670
Scott: Like, you know, rib breaking, heart surgeries, lungs?

443
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:52,590
Scott: It's a brain surgery.

444
00:25:53,712 --> 00:25:55,690
Scott: Oh, those graphics are vastly improved.

445
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,467
Rym: I think that one of these games is on the Apple 2GS.

446
00:25:57,971 --> 00:26:01,769
Scott: Oh, but actually the brain is severely... Well, that's the skull.

447
00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:04,448
Rym: They haven't cut that bit open yet.

448
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:05,870
Scott: Okay.

449
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,009
Rym: These games are so hard.

450
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:08,920
Scott: Anyway...

451
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,730
Rym: Also, they're super gross because they're super realistic.

452
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:13,990
Scott: Oh, it's super DOS pixelated.

453
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:18,429
Scott: Yeah, but it's still... I'm not even great at grossed out and I'm usually, you know... It's still super realistic.

454
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:19,949
Scott: Eh, whatever.

455
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:20,910
Rym: Anyway...

456
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,384
Scott: Okay, so someone made this cute little video.

457
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:24,450
Scott: It's just two minutes long.

458
00:26:25,015 --> 00:26:28,790
Scott: In which the D train... They're trying to coax the D train out of the tunnel.

459
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,768
Rym: This is adorbs.

460
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:30,385
Scott: It's cute.

461
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,022
Scott: You should watch it.

462
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,490
Scott: If you're from New York City or you've been here, it's funnier.

463
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,928
Scott: If you're not from here, you don't get the joke because we're better than you.

464
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:40,835
Rym: Ah.

465
00:26:42,056 --> 00:26:43,009
Rym: I had that conundrum today.

466
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,930
Rym: Sitting on a train that's stuck because of some other bullshit.

467
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,050
Rym: And then the local train comes up across the platform and I debate.

468
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:51,330
Rym: Do I bail?

469
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:52,309
Scott: Yes.

470
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:54,910
Rym: Bailing was the correct choice in this case.

471
00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:00,210
Scott: In my case, basically my new policy is any sign of anything, immediate bail.

472
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,450
Rym: But bail to what?

473
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,963
Rym: What if you're at like fucking 23rd street?

474
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,770
Scott: Okay, and what train am I trying to get?

475
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,909
Rym: Well, you're on the 6th and you're trying to get home.

476
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,422
Scott: And I switch to the N to 23rd.

477
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:10,546
Scott: You can do that.

478
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,220
Rym: Can you?

479
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:12,710
Scott: Madison Square Park, there's N trains.

480
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,770
Rym: You have to walk all the way... I guess you could walk over there.

481
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:15,988
Scott: Walk a little... It's not far.

482
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:16,789
Scott: It's a block.

483
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,670
Rym: If you don't have an unlimited card though, that's not a free transfer.

484
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,110
Scott: Oh, no.

485
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,229
Scott: Too bad I have an unlimited card because I'm the best.

486
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,629
Rym: I'm ditching my unlimited card because I calculated it is bullshit to have an unlimited card nowadays.

487
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,141
Scott: I've been thinking about it, but it's sort of...

488
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,330
Rym: If I bike one day every other week this summer, it's not worth it to have an unlimited card.

489
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,488
Scott: The thing is, if it's raining and...

490
00:27:39,652 --> 00:27:40,349
Rym: And you do a show.

491
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,210
Scott: And I do a show.

492
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:42,328
Scott: A show is three trips.

493
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:49,188
Rym: Scott, I read somebody that calculated you have to use it twice a day every weekday and eight times over the course of every weekend or it's not worth it.

494
00:27:50,456 --> 00:27:51,886
Rym: One, two, three... Anyway, anyway.

495
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,249
Scott: Metamoment.

496
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,069
Rym: The Book Club book is a book.

497
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,568
Scott: It is The Player of Games by E.N.M.

498
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:57,830
Scott: Banks.

499
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,590
Rym: It has been described as being in our collective wheelhouse.

500
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,129
Scott: It is the wheelhouse.

501
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,108
Scott: Have you read any of it yet?

502
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,989
Rym: Not yet because I've been busy getting ready for... Oh my God, PAX.

503
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,750
Scott: PAX East is really close.

504
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,129
Scott: Let's talk a whole bunch about it.

505
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,370
Rym: Oh my God, PAX is coming.

506
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,350
Scott: It's fucking next week.

507
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,570
Scott: As in, there is a weekend approaching.

508
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,207
Scott: The weekend after the approaching weekend is PAX East.

509
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:23,710
Rym: We are doing two lectures at the PAX East, the PAX, the Penny Arcade Expo.

510
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,510
Rym: At noon on Saturday, Mastering Game Mechanics Tabletop Workshop.

511
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:29,015
Rym: At 1.30 p.m.

512
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:32,650
Rym: on Saturday, same room, Practical Game Theory.

513
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:37,510
Rym: Think of this as like Games 101, Games 203.

514
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,990
Rym: This is like hardcore.

515
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,330
Rym: We're going to teach you guys stuff.

516
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,549
Scott: We're also enforcing.

517
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:48,268
Scott: So don't expect to see us too much because we'll be working, I guess, a shift each day or whatever it is.

518
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:49,366
Scott: Whatever they tell me to do.

519
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,290
Rym: I put in primarily for hardcore main theater logistics.

520
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,908
Rym: So maybe I'll be in there.

521
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,730
Rym: Jam Space, maybe I'll be in there dicking around with my harmonica.

522
00:28:59,151 --> 00:28:59,829
Scott: Oh, thank God.

523
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,050
Scott: You'll be in the Jam Space and not bothering anyone else.

524
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,450
Rym: Or I'm going for line entertainment.

525
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:09,150
Scott: Okay, I chose Tabletop, Info Boof, and whatever, whatever, whatever.

526
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:10,030
Scott: I don't give a shit really.

527
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,909
Rym: You've got to print out a Bidoof for the Info Boof.

528
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:12,988
Scott: Maybe I will.

529
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,304
Scott: Info Bidoof.

530
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:17,569
Rym: Also, ConnectiCon, our panel submissions are still open.

531
00:29:17,953 --> 00:29:19,210
Rym: Though we are currently scheduling.

532
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:19,850
Rym: And you know what?

533
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,365
Rym: Someone just submitted like 15 panels.

534
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,530
Rym: So good on you.

535
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,127
Scott: Nice.

536
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,410
Rym: Might have been multiple people, but those all came in today.

537
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,048
Rym: I'm at work and I just see this flood of panels coming in.

538
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,489
Scott: Hopefully they're not bad.

539
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:30,929
Rym: One of them looked really good.

540
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,090
Rym: I didn't look at the rest of them yet.

541
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,069
Scott: Fourteen look really good.

542
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,730
Rym: Fourteen Homestuck panels.

543
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,203
Scott: Great.

544
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,349
Scott: We only need one, guys.

545
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:37,069
Scott: One is enough.

546
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:41,770
Scott: There's still more meta.

547
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:43,349
Rym: You want to do more meta?

548
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:44,290
Scott: A little bit.

549
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:44,687
Scott: All right.

550
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:44,983
Rym: Go.

551
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:45,529
Rym: Go for it.

552
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,330
Rym: I just stopped recording.

553
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,129
Scott: Oh, I thought you did.

554
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,130
Scott: No, I didn't do anything.

555
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,066
Rym: Don't do.

556
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:49,450
Rym: What?

557
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:50,490
Rym: Are you reading my body language?

558
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,350
Scott: Anyway, the Grand Prix is still ongoing.

559
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,269
Rym: Well, because.

560
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:06,489
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of delayed the backgammon one because as I pointed out, Timo and I could mutually share a score of one times ten to the two hundred and three anyway in the first round.

561
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:06,870
Scott: Sure.

562
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:10,070
Scott: So the second round is backgammon.

563
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,168
Scott: It will be backgammon.

564
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:18,290
Scott: But I think, you know, we have had much discussion after the announcement around of changing of the format specifically.

565
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:22,629
Rym: You don't want me to collaborate with someone to have a score of one times ten to the two hundred and three?

566
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:24,829
Scott: I really don't think that it would matter that much.

567
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:29,550
Rym: I think it would matter heavily because no one else had the dedication to do that.

568
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,470
Rym: Also, because of the possibility of capturing pieces, the game could go on forever.

569
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,879
Scott: But why would you let it go on forever?

570
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,560
Rym: So that my score is effectively infinity.

571
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,718
Scott: But what if you lose?

572
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,038
Scott: Now your score is zero.

573
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,520
Rym: So the other guy's infinity.

574
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,460
Rym: So me and Timo collaborate.

575
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:57,480
Rym: One of us wins the five games and at the end of it, his score is five times effectively infinity and my score is three times effectively infinity.

576
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,520
Scott: So you're in big trouble.

577
00:30:58,882 --> 00:31:00,520
Scott: You're going to get two more infinities.

578
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,840
Rym: So the next highest score is probably like 40 and I get a guaranteed second place, which is a shit ton of points in the Grand Prix.

579
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,560
Scott: Anyway, we're going to change the format.

580
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:20,440
Scott: I have a feeling we're going to have to sacrifice at least one of the principles of the Grand Prix, and I think I have decided to sacrifice the principle of the Grand Prix won't take fucking forever.

581
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,679
Scott: So it's probably going to last some months.

582
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:24,198
Rym: That's how it's going to go.

583
00:31:24,364 --> 00:31:24,540
Scott: Yeah.

584
00:31:24,861 --> 00:31:27,577
Rym: So honestly, if you had to do the original timeline, I actually wasn't.

585
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:31,540
Rym: I was going to do that first round infinity and then not compete in the rest of it because I'm busy.

586
00:31:31,743 --> 00:31:31,852
Scott: Right.

587
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:35,100
Scott: So the Grand Prix is going to be a slow Grand Prix, right?

588
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,440
Scott: Maybe in fact, we should just change it to be forever ongoing.

589
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,539
Scott: Do we just keep having rounds and we keep seeing who's the best?

590
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:48,499
Scott: Of course, as the rounds go on, you know, there'll be a lot less movement in the upper ranks, but you never know.

591
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,154
Scott: Someone might bail and you can sneak up there with the.

592
00:31:51,335 --> 00:31:52,079
Rym: I'd rather finish it.

593
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:59,460
Rym: And then you can start a new one with different parameters, like maybe one that isn't accessible, one that, you know what, PC games only got to own them all.

594
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:02,260
Scott: Got to have a real hardcore computer and a fast Internet.

595
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,758
Scott: Got to have a physical Atari.

596
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:04,679
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,298
Scott: Anyway, you just want to win.

598
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:08,320
Scott: Don't worry, Rym.

599
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,937
Scott: I have a feeling some of the rounds may be favorable to you.

600
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:15,457
Scott: But yeah, I'm thinking now, you know, maybe we'll to make it more fair.

601
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:16,703
Scott: Right.

602
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:21,900
Scott: We're going to make it go a little longer, add some more rounds, take some push some of the time limits back on things.

603
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,401
Scott: Right.

604
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:32,459
Scott: And so look for an updated post on the reformatted backgammon second round, you know, and we'll see what happens.

605
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,940
Scott: And it's still an experiment to write.

606
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:41,060
Scott: It's like once we can figure out the logistics of this kind of thing, maybe, you know, it could evolve into something better.

607
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:41,844
Rym: Yep.

608
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:44,500
Rym: And don't forget our relatively new, ongoing show.

609
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:52,107
Rym: GeekNights presents is continuing with Shoujo Kakamei Utena or five in thirty five or so to go.

610
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:52,777
Rym: That's a lot.

611
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:56,080
Rym: OK, so this is Scott's idea.

612
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:58,540
Scott: So, you know, we're trying to think of a tech show.

613
00:32:58,681 --> 00:33:00,060
Scott: We're pretty much out of ideas.

614
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,861
Scott: So if there's anything you want us to talk about at a Monday show, you should let us know about that.

615
00:33:05,206 --> 00:33:09,982
Scott: But one idea that I came up with just out of nowhere is a lot of these tech websites.

616
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:24,646
Scott: What they do is they'll find a famous or semi-famous tech person and they'll sort of do a post like what's in their bag, like what, you know, and they'll empty the person's bag out, take a photo of it and ask them about all the gadgets they have and use frequently.

617
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:25,960
Scott: So I don't carry a bag anymore.

618
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:26,642
Scott: Great.

619
00:33:27,123 --> 00:33:38,860
Scott: So I'm thinking, hey, let's just do a show where we discuss sort of our technological arsenals, like what are the gadgets and devices of technological nature?

620
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:42,040
Scott: or relatively, I mean, even a fork is technology, right?

621
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:56,156
Scott: I'm talking about like an advanced, right, fire, the items of an advanced transistor based, you know, Scott was really unhappy with my questioning of the parameters of this discussion before the show.

622
00:33:57,641 --> 00:33:57,883
Scott: Right.

623
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:01,340
Rym: That you use frequently, there was a little bit of consternation.

624
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:07,987
Scott: I don't want to get talking into like what pens I've got or notebooks or, you know, about that.

625
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:09,014
Scott: That's not Monday shit.

626
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:11,199
Scott: That's that shit is all good.

627
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,003
Scott: But it's not.

628
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:14,981
Rym: So I wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy.

629
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:25,799
Rym: OK, so pretty much if I think about what I interact with first and last and what I interact with the most times throughout the day, it's my cell phone.

630
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,560
Scott: Well, obviously, it's what phone you have.

631
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:29,817
Rym: I still have my Samsung Nexus S.

632
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:32,199
Scott: And you don't feel like you need something better?

633
00:34:32,782 --> 00:34:39,438
Rym: I refuse to upgrade until I'm forced to, because there's no phone that small that exists, that isn't a piece of shit.

634
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:49,219
Rym: So I'm going to hold on to this phone until either Google forces me to to make Google Glass work or I physically break it, can't get another one.

635
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,779
Rym: I've replaced it with a refurbished one already once.

636
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:58,120
Rym: And I'm not going to get an iPhone because I'm morally opposed to the lockdown.

637
00:34:59,282 --> 00:35:02,740
Scott: You realize the iPhone is probably less locked down.

638
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,264
Rym: Well, we'll see.

639
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:07,580
Scott: I mean, in terms I mean, a Verizon iPhone is evil as Verizon.

640
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:08,478
Scott: I don't have Verizon.

641
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,162
Rym: What?

642
00:35:09,182 --> 00:35:10,040
Scott: I don't have Verizon.

643
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,311
Scott: I'm just saying you could switch, but it's not locked at all.

644
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,219
Scott: I can go to any country with this phone, with any SIM card, and it'll totally work.

645
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,498
Rym: Oh, no, I'm saying there's iOS.

646
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,601
Scott: Yeah.

647
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:22,780
Scott: I mean, jailbreaking iOS is no different than rooting Android.

648
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,613
Scott: It's the same shit.

649
00:35:23,716 --> 00:35:23,940
Scott: True.

650
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,727
Scott: So how?

651
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:25,880
Scott: what's the difference in lockdown?

652
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,608
Rym: Honestly, it's mostly not like it's.

653
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:32,619
Scott: not like they give you a dev kit for the Android phone and say, go nuts, kid.

654
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:33,025
Scott: Right.

655
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,039
Scott: Hack it all you want.

656
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,599
Rym: If you really want to get down to it is that I plan to, as much as is feasible, side load bullshit for glass if I get glass.

657
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:44,640
Scott: Well, what do you need to side load bullshit for glass?

658
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,478
Scott: The glasses itself.

659
00:35:46,498 --> 00:35:46,620
Scott: Right.

660
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,587
Scott: What do you mean?

661
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,199
Rym: I need applications to do cool stuff.

662
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:51,900
Scott: You load those into the glass themselves.

663
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:53,594
Rym: Not 100 percent.

664
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:53,818
Rym: There's.

665
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:56,460
Rym: Have you read any of the documents about how this thing all works?

666
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,880
Scott: What documents are you reading?

667
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,060
Scott: Bob, stuff on the internet.

668
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,172
Scott: Because it says glass works with iPhone.

669
00:36:00,212 --> 00:36:00,900
Scott: So how is that going to work?

670
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,620
Rym: It does work with iPhone, but I think more cool stuff is going to come out for Android first.

671
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:15,319
Scott: Anyway, I think that the here's my thinking, right, is that if glass comes to be, which it will, and, you know, we're definitely going to have it by next year.

672
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:19,459
Scott: Even if they don't give them to us early in the Explorers Club, we'll just buy them.

673
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:20,223
Scott: Right.

674
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:20,747
Scott: Yeah.

675
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:22,379
Scott: And that should be by the end of the year.

676
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,462
Scott: Right.

677
00:36:24,444 --> 00:36:35,362
Scott: So a large phone will become still annoying and stupid, but slightly less annoying and stupid because you could just keep that large phone in your pocket and never take it the fuck out.

678
00:36:35,382 --> 00:36:40,999
Rym: The problem is, if I have glass, I actually want an even smaller phone because I'll use it less.

679
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,343
Rym: I want is in fact, at that point, I just want a tiny brick that I stick in my bag and never touch again.

680
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,860
Rym: I just charge it once a day wirelessly wherever I am.

681
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,321
Rym: And that's it.

682
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:59,439
Rym: Anyway, but I'm thinking about it when I wake up in the morning, literally my phone wakes me up and replace my alarm clock.

683
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:00,724
Rym: A hundred percent.

684
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:04,960
Scott: I still have a clock, but the phone is has the alarm on it.

685
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,620
Rym: But I also have a clock.

686
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,799
Scott: And the only reason I have the clock is that if I open my eyes, I can see the time without having to grab and touch the phone.

687
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:21,040
Rym: I have glasses and the clock is on Emily's side of the bed, so I can't actually see the clock, but it is the clock that I had in middle school.

688
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,759
Scott: I have an ice tube clock.

689
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:24,440
Scott: It was actually a kit that I built.

690
00:37:25,183 --> 00:37:27,540
Scott: You can get it from Adafruit.

691
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,920
Scott: I mean, you buy it and then you solder it together.

692
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,840
Rym: I wake up because my alarm is going off.

693
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,619
Rym: I reach over, I pick up my phone, I look at it.

694
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,219
Rym: It's the first thing I see.

695
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,939
Rym: I fuck around the Internet for like five minutes.

696
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,362
Scott: Yeah.

697
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:43,318
Rym: And at the end of the day, I look at my phone, make sure the alarm set, fucker out for five minutes and go to sleep.

698
00:37:44,003 --> 00:37:47,840
Rym: So it literally bookends my life and is my source of data throughout the entire day.

699
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,959
Scott: I have iPhone five, pretty much the same thing.

700
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:53,324
Scott: Yeah.

701
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,500
Scott: So what other things do I have?

702
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:01,179
Rym: Oh, the other reason I'm waiting is that when I, you know, lockdown, think of it more in the sense of I'm not on contract right now.

703
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:04,900
Rym: I don't want to be on contract with anyone for as long as possible.

704
00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:08,520
Rym: OK, that way I can switch providers suddenly if I want.

705
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,079
Scott: I just switched every two years and the contract runs out.

706
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,040
Rym: Yeah, but I'm currently out of contract.

707
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:16,140
Scott: So if that's what that's how I constantly have a new phone.

708
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,461
Scott: Yeah.

709
00:38:16,481 --> 00:38:22,019
Rym: But if I upgrade or re-up or switch, I'll be locked in again because I don't really want to pay the six or seven hundred.

710
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,419
Scott: You could buy it on like.

711
00:38:23,861 --> 00:38:24,142
Scott: Yeah.

712
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:30,363
Scott: OK, so I have this pebble watch that I got because Kickstarter has that working out for you.

713
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:35,560
Scott: You know, on the one hand, when it works, it does one and only one thing.

714
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,044
Scott: Well, you see notifications, you see notifications on your arm without having to take your phone out of your pocket.

715
00:38:40,788 --> 00:38:45,640
Scott: The problem is and I'm not sure how much this is the fault of the pebble and how much is the fault of the iPhone.

716
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,684
Scott: It seems to forget to.

717
00:38:48,648 --> 00:38:52,240
Scott: I guess I think the iPhone forgets to notify the pebbles.

718
00:38:52,380 --> 00:39:01,600
Scott: You have to go into the iPhone and sort of like touch a bunch of stuff to get it to remember, you know, for each app, like, yeah, by the way, Gmail app, you should notify.

719
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:02,664
Scott: Oh, yeah.

720
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:05,140
Scott: By the way, Twitter app, you should notify.

721
00:39:05,362 --> 00:39:07,319
Scott: And it takes like about a minute to do that.

722
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:08,589
Rym: So it's useless.

723
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:10,120
Scott: then it's a little bit annoying.

724
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:13,880
Scott: I'm waiting for that iPhone watch so I can get rid of this pebble watch.

725
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,180
Rym: Yeah, I'm thinking about buying Apple stock ahead of that watch coming out.

726
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,159
Rym: I think people are just underestimating how crazy awesome a working AR watch will be.

727
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:24,340
Scott: Yeah, well, it's not an AR watch.

728
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,919
Scott: It's really just a cell phone on your arm.

729
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,078
Rym: Yeah, well, it's a display for your cell phone on your arm.

730
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,076
Scott: Well, I think that will probably run on iOS.

731
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,023
Scott: Yeah, so that it'll be a device in itself and not necessarily something that needs to work with.

732
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,259
Scott: Yeah, but I'll buy one of those day one, no matter what.

733
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:41,298
Scott: And maybe not if it's a thousand dollars, but it won't be.

734
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,525
Scott: Let's see what other.

735
00:39:43,646 --> 00:39:50,080
Rym: So if we go in order of things I interact with that are notable, it's kitchen appliances, which Scott seems incredibly unhappy.

736
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,316
Scott: I don't think kitchen appliances are applicable to Monday.

737
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,446
Rym: These are technology.

738
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:57,980
Scott: We could do a whole Thursday show just on kitchen appliances.

739
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,540
Rym: But I want to talk about these two things.

740
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,320
Scott: Why would he waste them all on Monday?

741
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,167
Scott: Because I interact with these.

742
00:40:03,187 --> 00:40:07,899
Rym: if we're talking about the 10 significant things I interact with on a daily basis.

743
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,540
Scott: Who said that you're coming up with that 10 significant things out of nowhere and five.

744
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,748
Rym: I don't interact with that.

745
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:15,040
Scott: I'm not saying any specific number.

746
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,640
Scott: I'm saying what is your technological arsenal?

747
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:21,459
Rym: Well, if it's my arsenal that I carry around with me, it's literally just my cell phone.

748
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:22,144
Scott: And that's it.

749
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:24,540
Rym: And possibly my laptop.

750
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:29,080
Rym: If I'm going somewhere where I'm going to do work at some point while I'm out there.

751
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,339
Scott: No, I have many more items.

752
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,562
Scott: I got this Lenovo X 201, which is the last one that had the good keyboard and the good touchpad.

753
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:43,144
Rym: You mean the slightly not the worst touchpad in the world, but still terrible touchpad.

754
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:45,660
Rym: I don't like that touchpad.

755
00:40:45,982 --> 00:40:48,583
Scott: Oh, this one is way better than the X 230.

756
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:48,929
Rym: I'll agree.

757
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,479
Scott: My work.

758
00:40:49,701 --> 00:40:53,020
Scott: I have the X to whatever the one above this.

759
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:54,045
Scott: But right.

760
00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:56,720
Scott: And that one, the touchpad is horrendously useless.

761
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,160
Scott: You know, this one is just fine.

762
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,100
Rym: Dells actually have really nice touchpads.

763
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,840
Scott: The Apple touchpad is the best.

764
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,840
Rym: But every other aspect of Dell laptops makes me want to kill babies.

765
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:07,700
Scott: The Apple touchpad, the magic trackpad.

766
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:15,520
Rym: Yeah, I have my Lenovo X 230, but I don't consider it part of my arsenal because I literally only carry it when I'm going to need horsepower on the go.

767
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,420
Scott: I use mine at conventions.

768
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,780
Scott: I use mine to bring here for podcasting.

769
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,739
Scott: I use mine to compute if I don't want to get out of bed.

770
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:27,540
Scott: I use it when I need like, you know, a separate computer to be doing something.

771
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:29,980
Scott: And I don't want my main computer to be doing it.

772
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,060
Rym: I do it for all those things.

773
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:32,520
Rym: But it's not in terms.

774
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:40,139
Rym: I interact with my Japanese fancy hot water heater way more often than I interact with my laptop because that shit saves me time.

775
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:41,283
Scott: OK.

776
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:44,480
Rym: It keeps water at the exact right temperature for either coffee or tea.

777
00:41:44,946 --> 00:41:45,879
Rym: And it's just sitting there already.

778
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:46,924
Rym: Super efficient.

779
00:41:47,387 --> 00:41:49,159
Rym: And I just hit a button and I make my tea.

780
00:41:49,662 --> 00:41:49,963
Scott: Great.

781
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:52,760
Scott: What other things do I have?

782
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,993
Scott: I have stuff.

783
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:01,300
Rym: I mean, in front of me, I got a Samsung Sync Master 172 X. And I got Adele.

784
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,920
Scott: That's my monitor that you took.

785
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,405
Scott: It is.

786
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,199
Rym: Want it back?

787
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,442
Scott: Not really.

788
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:12,658
Rym: And I got Adele UltraSharp 16 by 10, which I'm going to get a second one of those and get rid of the Samsung Sync Master 172 X.

789
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:14,520
Scott: I have two of that monitor.

790
00:42:14,761 --> 00:42:15,880
Rym: I'm going to have two of this monitor.

791
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,680
Rym: I'm going to put them like this.

792
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,778
Scott: I have them on arms.

793
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,940
Scott: I think they're ergo whatever arms.

794
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,300
Scott: If you look at my Amazon review history, you'll see what kind of arms they are.

795
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,620
Rym: I'm not going to arm it until I replace my desk with a permanent desk.

796
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,980
Scott: Your desk would not arm well at all.

797
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:30,740
Scott: At least not with the kind of arms I get.

798
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,560
Rym: I would get a different kind of desk, I think, in the long run.

799
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,959
Rym: I would get one that I can hang.

800
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,200
Rym: Basically, I need one that I can actually fit the monitor on.

801
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
Rym: The monitor is too big to fit in the monitor hole.

802
00:42:41,964 --> 00:42:43,159
Rym: So it's in front of the monitor hole.

803
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,880
Scott: I didn't like that desk when you got it, but you got it.

804
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:47,140
Rym: Oh, I loved it up until this point.

805
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,200
Rym: I mean, I fit that gigantic CRT in there for the longest time.

806
00:42:51,841 --> 00:42:52,999
Scott: Anyway, let's see.

807
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,479
Scott: What other things do I have?

808
00:42:55,343 --> 00:42:56,440
Rym: We talk about all the Geeknight stuff.

809
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:02,720
Rym: I mean, I got my awesome computer, but I haven't really fussed with that computer much in a long time.

810
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,220
Rym: And it's so powerful.

811
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,738
Rym: I won't need to upgrade it for easily another year.

812
00:43:07,622 --> 00:43:08,639
Scott: Probably even longer than that.

813
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,240
Rym: Well, I'm going to have to add a new video card to it within the next year because I have a GTX 260 in there.

814
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:16,073
Scott: That's pretty old, right?

815
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:16,357
Scott: Yeah.

816
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,626
Rym: Yeah.

817
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:18,840
Rym: I'm going to get a 680.

818
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,779
Rym: I was waiting for a price drop.

819
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:20,725
Scott: I would just wait.

820
00:43:20,947 --> 00:43:22,459
Scott: I just get a 780 when it came out.

821
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:23,144
Rym: Depends.

822
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:24,320
Scott: Maybe it depends.

823
00:43:24,722 --> 00:43:27,620
Rym: I don't know if I. if the 780 comes out, I might get the 680 super cheap.

824
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,045
Scott: Yeah, but it'll still be.

825
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:32,272
Scott: now the 780 will be like 260.

826
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:34,840
Rym: plays all my games at pretty high frame rates.

827
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:38,640
Rym: Anyway, I only want the 680 for Premiere live rendering of effects.

828
00:43:38,861 --> 00:43:41,540
Scott: It's like, you know, on the one hand, I totally agree.

829
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:43,818
Scott: I had a 460 and I just got rid of it.

830
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:44,683
Scott: All right.

831
00:43:44,763 --> 00:43:46,733
Scott: And the 460 when I got rid of it could still play.

832
00:43:46,753 --> 00:43:48,200
Scott: all the games are pretty high frame rates.

833
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:50,502
Scott: But now they have the 680.

834
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:50,744
Scott: Right.

835
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:52,820
Scott: I can play every game.

836
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:54,114
Scott: All the games.

837
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:54,356
Scott: Yeah.

838
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:01,540
Rym: Scott, can you play settings in full frame vertical sync no matter what of your last 10 hours of PC gaming?

839
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,760
Rym: How many of them have been something that wasn't natural selection to all natural selection to natural selection to run fine on my computer?

840
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:10,739
Scott: Bob, but are you playing at full settings?

841
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:12,225
Rym: Actually, no, I'm not.

842
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:13,853
Scott: Are you playing at 19, whatever?

843
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,940
Rym: I am playing at my full resolution.

844
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,120
Scott: OK, but yeah, I have the full set.

845
00:44:19,884 --> 00:44:22,780
Rym: I couldn't play my games in my full native resolution.

846
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:23,942
Rym: Fuck that noise.

847
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:24,223
Scott: Right.

848
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:30,860
Scott: I'm playing a full res 100 percent max, every possible setting, even anti aliasing, even endisotropic.

849
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,859
Rym: Apparently in the new Tomb Raider, there is an effect called Tress something that's just her hair.

850
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:36,783
Scott: OK.

851
00:44:37,104 --> 00:44:39,255
Rym: And if you turn it on, you lose 15 and 30 FPS.

852
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,900
Scott: It's so I have vertical sync at 60 FPS on all the time.

853
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,020
Scott: 100 percent of the time, if you look at the benchmarks.

854
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,182
Scott: Right.

855
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:48,359
Scott: It's just a flat line.

856
00:44:49,182 --> 00:44:54,900
Scott: And I can run fraps at 60 FPS recording while I'm playing and still not lose.

857
00:44:55,461 --> 00:44:56,246
Rym: I have a feeling.

858
00:44:56,286 --> 00:44:58,319
Rym: the fraps are you writing to an SSD?

859
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,528
Scott: All it also works.

860
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:02,040
Scott: writing to the magnetic drive I tested.

861
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:07,000
Scott: No, it's great, you know, but I mean, that's a 60 gig per second seriality either way.

862
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,341
Scott: Right.

863
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:13,640
Scott: I mean, it's not like it's a slow magnet drive, but yeah, the video card was five hundred dollars.

864
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:22,140
Scott: But having the best video card once you have it, you realize sort of like, oh, that's why those crazy people, SLI and crazy shit.

865
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:23,739
Rym: I bet that is real.

866
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:30,440
Rym: I remember when I spent four hundred bucks on a creative graphics blaster extreme.

867
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,904
Scott: This is why I will never buy.

868
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:36,820
Scott: Well, unless I win a lottery or something, I should never buy a Ferrari because then I won't be able to drive a different car.

869
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,499
Scott: I'll be like, what the fuck is this really fast, not hundred thousand dollar car?

870
00:45:43,602 --> 00:45:46,020
Rym: Well, Scott, I think this applies to other aspects of your life.

871
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,540
Rym: How would you feel about going to the Outback Steakhouse?

872
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:51,659
Rym: See what happens?

873
00:45:52,841 --> 00:45:53,340
Scott: Yeah, I see what happens.

874
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,576
Rym: Actually, I could feel Outback because they make a particular kind of average prime rib.

875
00:45:57,596 --> 00:45:58,480
Rym: that's actually pretty good.

876
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,479
Scott: I mean, I really like that fucking bloomin' onion thing.

877
00:46:01,761 --> 00:46:03,320
Rym: That's basically carnal food, though.

878
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,040
Scott: You can get it at Chili's also, and I think I'm not going to Chili's.

879
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,540
Scott: I think those both might actually be owned by the same people.

880
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:08,958
Scott: I'm not sure.

881
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:09,746
Rym: They probably are.

882
00:46:09,787 --> 00:46:10,620
Rym: It's all the same freezing.

883
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:12,378
Scott: It's that same onion thingy.

884
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:12,981
Rym: Whatever.

885
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:16,160
Rym: Someone I knew who was restaurant, you know, a pendulum, like some people are circus.

886
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:24,500
Rym: Someone I knew who was restaurant said that all those restaurants, all their desserts and most of their entrees are literally from the same factory and they're just frozen, delivered.

887
00:46:25,163 --> 00:46:26,140
Scott: And yeah, most of the food.

888
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,820
Rym: And the quote unquote chefs just warm them and then serve them.

889
00:46:29,102 --> 00:46:30,199
Scott: There was a term for that.

890
00:46:31,426 --> 00:46:32,579
Rym: No, most people don't know that.

891
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:33,540
Scott: It's not a secret.

892
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:35,038
Rym: Most people don't know that.

893
00:46:35,341 --> 00:46:38,099
Scott: OK, well, my dad works in food service, so I know a lot of these things.

894
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,560
Rym: Yes, most people don't know that.

895
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:51,080
Rym: I had a conversation with someone a month ago or so where they were shocked that chocolate cake and for dessert at the vast majority of restaurants is the same frozen chocolate cake is not baked at that restaurant.

896
00:46:51,381 --> 00:46:54,760
Scott: Yeah, yeah, because there's people at Applebee's who know how to make chocolate cake.

897
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,059
Scott: People in Applebee's are no cheesecake and and and they bake them every day.

898
00:46:59,261 --> 00:47:00,715
Scott: Yeah, and they always have them ready, right?

899
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:01,762
Scott: Oh, yeah.

900
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:04,420
Scott: Even Capitol Grill, someplace that's fancy in a chain.

901
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,440
Scott: You'd be surprised what goes on in the back.

902
00:47:06,662 --> 00:47:07,819
Rym: I would not be surprised at all.

903
00:47:08,205 --> 00:47:08,580
Scott: No, you should.

904
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,740
Rym: You can start to tell which restaurants have or don't usually comes down to one of those.

905
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:19,820
Rym: You can tell a rich person's dessert because it involves some weird ritualistic preparation at the table.

906
00:47:20,361 --> 00:47:25,160
Scott: I mean, if you really think about it, you go to let's say I go to a fancy Italian restaurant, I get a fancy pasta dish, right?

907
00:47:25,701 --> 00:47:26,243
Scott: It's pretty good.

908
00:47:27,027 --> 00:47:29,700
Scott: And it costs, what, 15 bucks, maybe average place, right?

909
00:47:30,141 --> 00:47:39,420
Scott: If I just go to a everything lunch place and have them make me a custom pasta, which takes about three minutes, that's basically the same exact thing the fancy restaurant did for fifteen dollars.

910
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,099
Rym: Well, because it's not actually the fancy restaurant.

911
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:41,923
Rym: That's the.

912
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:44,780
Rym: that's the normal restaurant for half as much money.

913
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,320
Scott: And, you know, it's an amazing return.

914
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,899
Rym: You spend, you know, five hundred bucks on the video card.

915
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:54,020
Rym: The nine hundred dollar video card is not that much better.

916
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:54,778
Scott: No, you don't need that.

917
00:47:55,021 --> 00:48:00,120
Rym: If you go to the Italian restaurant where it's sixty dollars, that's some amazing pasta.

918
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:03,020
Rym: But is it fifty dollars more?

919
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,660
Scott: All I'm saying is that a reasonable person buys a three hundred dollar video card and that's enough to last a long time.

920
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:15,140
Scott: But if you haven't had five hundred dollar video card when you have it, you know what?

921
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,520
Scott: It's real hard to go back to three hundred dollars video card.

922
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,060
Rym: New PC gaming is your thing as opposed to just a dablence.

923
00:48:23,684 --> 00:48:25,680
Rym: Then, yeah, you should have the second best video card.

924
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,819
Scott: Also, it's real nice.

925
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:34,320
Scott: Once I got Premiere to actually use the GPU, everything renders in real fucking time all the time.

926
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,979
Scott: Like just previews, just play like it's a video I downloaded and I'm playing it in VLC.

927
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,460
Rym: Now, what's interesting is mine.

928
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,319
Rym: Just do that, too.

929
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:49,500
Rym: The only time that is not the case is if I have multiple scaled 1080p streams simultaneously and I'm trying to do that multi camera mode.

930
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:50,436
Rym: Then no, I can't.

931
00:48:50,781 --> 00:48:52,679
Scott: Yeah, anyway, let's move on to other.

932
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:57,390
Rym: So logical items that we use every day that none of you care about is?

933
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,720
Rym: I got a whole bunch of analog audio equipment such as.

934
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:06,900
Rym: So I got my beta 87, a fancy hypercardioid microphone.

935
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,656
Scott: Tell us about it.

936
00:49:08,503 --> 00:49:10,898
Rym: It's a condenser microphone that's hypercardioid.

937
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:15,600
Rym: OK, meaning it's hyper directional like just now.

938
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,760
Rym: I'm now at the side of the microphone slightly.

939
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,967
Rym: Scott can verify I'm.

940
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,040
Rym: I'm not far away from the microphone.

941
00:49:21,383 --> 00:49:23,260
Rym: And now I'm back in front of the microphone like normal.

942
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:26,220
Rym: And it's like night and day, the pickup patterns.

943
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,120
Rym: Scott has a less expensive microphone because he refused to buy the fancy one when I upped the microphones.

944
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:33,439
Scott: What do I need it for?

945
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,640
Scott: Is anyone having a problem with how I sound on this podcast?

946
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,738
Rym: It just makes it easier for me.

947
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,980
Scott: That's not my problem.

948
00:49:39,001 --> 00:49:40,680
Scott: Why should I pay money to make things easy for you?

949
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,199
Scott: You don't do anything to make things easier for me.

950
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,080
Rym: Except all the audio and video editing for GeekNights.

951
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,657
Scott: Except making annoying noises when no one wants you to stop.

952
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:49,587
Scott: Exactly.

953
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:56,820
Scott: So when you stop making annoying noises, I will stop doing everything I can to make your life miserable as well.

954
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,910
Rym: But that I we upgraded those years ago.

955
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,578
Scott: It's not like microphones.

956
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,179
Scott: Microphones last a lot longer than video cards.

957
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,140
Rym: Well, the thing is, we used to use the SM57, which are really good microphones, but they're ancient technology.

958
00:50:13,623 --> 00:50:13,785
Scott: Yep.

959
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:15,159
Scott: But they're really good.

960
00:50:15,742 --> 00:50:18,299
Rym: We got these just because we wanted to step up.

961
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:22,080
Rym: We'll never really need to upgrade beyond these ever unless I break them.

962
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,200
Scott: Well, unless someone has like a huge, sudden advance in microphone technology, which I highly doubt.

963
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:29,419
Rym: Well, what I want.

964
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,839
Rym: Talk about technology I want.

965
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,200
Scott: They could miniaturize them somehow.

966
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:38,160
Rym: I want to get the exact same lavaliers that the TED Talk people use because they're so expensive.

967
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,626
Rym: Yeah, they're about three hundred bucks.

968
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:41,780
Scott: a major advance would be like making those really cheap.

969
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:43,060
Rym: They're about three hundred bucks each.

970
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,840
Rym: Not counting the transmission stuff you need for the wireless, the receivers.

971
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:54,540
Rym: And yeah, OK, but all our audio equipment is actually from the some of the earliest days of GeekNights.

972
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,599
Rym: We have not upgraded this shit at all.

973
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,080
Scott: Why don't you tell us about that little box there?

974
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,319
Scott: It says fire on it.

975
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,976
Rym: Oh, so the fire studio I got when I found this one like 2009, I bought it some years ago.

976
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:09,236
Rym: But basically for the for the longest time, the way GeekNights worked is.

977
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:10,200
Rym: we had a mixer.

978
00:51:10,603 --> 00:51:12,120
Rym: I'll post a picture of our first mixer.

979
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,768
Rym: It's kind of cute.

980
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:13,720
Scott: Didn't we give it to Nuri?

981
00:51:14,082 --> 00:51:16,879
Rym: Yeah, I think we gave it to Nuri because she was doing our Artist Alley podcast.

982
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:18,817
Rym: That was a long time ago.

983
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,787
Rym: So that mixer, we would plug into this little.

984
00:51:21,988 --> 00:51:34,166
Rym: well, actually, originally I plugged it into an internal sound card, which was actually my graphics blaster, graphics blaster, my sound blaster, the last sound blaster, the sound blaster live.

985
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:37,140
Rym: that I spent some ridiculous amount of money for at RIT.

986
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,438
Rym: Let me tell you what.

987
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:43,140
Rym: The era of the internal sound card ended around the year 2000.

988
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,359
Rym: Fuck internal sound cards, garbage ass pieces of shit.

989
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:48,180
Scott: I use my worthless.

990
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,360
Scott: I use mine just so I get the front headphone jacks on the computer playing audio.

991
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:53,064
Rym: They're fine.

992
00:51:53,285 --> 00:51:55,940
Rym: You're not if you notice the static and the noise.

993
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,040
Scott: Well, I had static and noise in the previous computer, but the new computer now you still do.

994
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,000
Rym: You just don't notice it because it doesn't really matter.

995
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,364
Scott: It's really.

996
00:52:02,404 --> 00:52:03,540
Scott: it's much less than it was.

997
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,179
Scott: The other one used to be like, but it is in there.

998
00:52:06,481 --> 00:52:12,420
Rym: So early on, we switched to a little cheapo external USB sound card.

999
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,960
Rym: And it was like night and day in terms of sound quality, but wasn't great.

1000
00:52:16,462 --> 00:52:18,360
Rym: We could really only record two channels.

1001
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:22,040
Rym: And even then, that was by doing something so awesome and ghetto.

1002
00:52:22,742 --> 00:52:24,200
Rym: Scott was on the left channel.

1003
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:25,939
Rym: I was on the right channel.

1004
00:52:26,303 --> 00:52:27,739
Rym: I recorded in stereo.

1005
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:28,420
Scott: Yeah.

1006
00:52:28,661 --> 00:52:33,920
Scott: I mean, if I really needed to, I would get one of those gaming headsets that comes with the USB sound card as part of it.

1007
00:52:34,062 --> 00:52:35,579
Rym: I have that as well.

1008
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:38,617
Rym: In fact, in my computer right now are one, two.

1009
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,879
Rym: I have five active sound cards.

1010
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:41,421
Scott: Great.

1011
00:52:41,622 --> 00:52:43,108
Scott: Yeah.

1012
00:52:43,148 --> 00:52:45,780
Rym: No, four, because right now the gaming headsets unplugged for some reason.

1013
00:52:46,645 --> 00:52:47,680
Scott: So other things.

1014
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,040
Scott: Well, yeah.

1015
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:56,380
Rym: So I bought the Fire Studio Mobile, which was the cheapest good firewire audio thing, because USB basically sucks for audio.

1016
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:57,527
Rym: It just doesn't have.

1017
00:52:58,452 --> 00:52:59,719
Rym: there's not good support for it.

1018
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:01,800
Scott: I need professional audio.

1019
00:53:01,921 --> 00:53:02,102
Scott: Right.

1020
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:04,760
Scott: If you're if you're just doing your gaming, USB is just fine.

1021
00:53:05,162 --> 00:53:08,440
Rym: But I have a fire studio which has eight channels on it.

1022
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,040
Rym: It has two preamplified microphone inputs with phantom power in the front.

1023
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:19,080
Rym: We could just plug our microphones directly into this thing and just record straight up in super high quality.

1024
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:19,642
Scott: And so the way.

1025
00:53:19,682 --> 00:53:23,260
Scott: the reason this thing is so great is you connect it to your computer with a firewire cable.

1026
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:25,139
Scott: And then in Adobe Audition.

1027
00:53:26,321 --> 00:53:26,783
Scott: Right.

1028
00:53:27,164 --> 00:53:31,900
Scott: And everyone talking shows up separately on their own tracks.

1029
00:53:32,261 --> 00:53:40,180
Scott: So if like one person's too loud, you can easily just make that track quieter instead of having to somehow split the people apart or do anything like that.

1030
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:40,843
Scott: It's like now.

1031
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:43,620
Rym: the thing has tons of inputs, tons of outputs.

1032
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,920
Rym: I didn't actually realize because I didn't need it at the time.

1033
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,360
Rym: But it has this crazy MIDI functionality that I might start using if I start trying to make music again.

1034
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:50,801
Rym: Great.

1035
00:53:51,182 --> 00:53:56,140
Rym: But it is super useful, but I don't actually use the microphone inputs on the front of it.

1036
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,240
Rym: I've never plugged shit into those things because I have a gigantic analog mixer.

1037
00:54:02,183 --> 00:54:04,200
Rym: And a gigantic analog compressor.

1038
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:04,821
Rym: And you know what?

1039
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:21,100
Rym: To this day, having an analog compressor and a good preamplifier inline analog before you digitize is way better than recording in a high bit rate and a high sort of ceiling digital all the way and then doing it all in post.

1040
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:34,880
Rym: Audio compression still really needs to be done for this kind of audio at the analog level, partly just because we don't have the technology to have a microphone that has such a wide dynamic range.

1041
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:44,220
Rym: My voice doing what I'm doing right now will completely surpass the dynamic range of the microphone in the course of an episode of GeekNights.

1042
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:46,403
Scott: Anyway.

1043
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:46,806
Scott: All right.

1044
00:54:46,846 --> 00:54:48,680
Scott: So let's try to think of other things.

1045
00:54:48,821 --> 00:54:49,767
Rym: The mixer's gigantic.

1046
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:50,875
Rym: It's some XENIX piece of shit.

1047
00:54:50,895 --> 00:54:51,157
Rym: You know what?

1048
00:54:51,177 --> 00:54:51,660
Rym: It works fine.

1049
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,122
Scott: Yeah.

1050
00:54:52,182 --> 00:54:53,151
Scott: It means a mixer, right?

1051
00:54:53,171 --> 00:54:54,220
Scott: It either works or doesn't work.

1052
00:54:54,521 --> 00:54:59,300
Rym: No, actually, the argument of it works or it doesn't work primarily applies to digital stuff.

1053
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:04,459
Rym: With analog audio equipment, there is a wide degree of works or doesn't work.

1054
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:05,782
Rym: There is.

1055
00:55:05,962 --> 00:55:10,040
Rym: it is literally the better connectors sound better because there's less noise.

1056
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,060
Scott: Yeah.

1057
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:18,660
Scott: I mean, once you get to the level of, you know, not ten dollars, though, usually there's not enough noise to matter for all but the most professional of applications.

1058
00:55:18,821 --> 00:55:22,840
Scott: There's significant recording studio or gigantic arena concert.

1059
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,800
Rym: There is significant noise in the mixer we use, actually.

1060
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,519
Rym: You know how I got around that?

1061
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,860
Rym: That's part of the reason why I bought the nicer microphones, because they have much higher gain on their own.

1062
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:36,160
Rym: So I don't need to put the preamp up as high.

1063
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,980
Scott: The preamps, the quality of the preamps in the mixer.

1064
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,100
Rym: But a standalone preamp that's good is like five hundred bucks.

1065
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:43,641
Scott: Well, you could.

1066
00:55:43,661 --> 00:55:43,762
Scott: Yeah.

1067
00:55:43,782 --> 00:55:48,080
Scott: Well, I mean, that's the thing is you can get a preamp and plug it into the non amplified channels on the mixer.

1068
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:55,880
Rym: But if I was doing that, I would at that point, I would go preamp direct into the fire studio, the studio has its own preamps, but they actually kind of suck.

1069
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:02,320
Scott: Well, I mean, very rarely is that do any anyone put the highest, awesomest preamps into something.

1070
00:56:02,483 --> 00:56:03,519
Scott: They're usually on their own.

1071
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:09,120
Rym: Anyway, if you want to hear me talk about the audio equipment, I think I did a show on this in like 2007.

1072
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,899
Rym: That hasn't changed much.

1073
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,221
Scott: Yeah.

1074
00:56:10,605 --> 00:56:12,460
Scott: Let's talk about camera equipment.

1075
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,181
Scott: All right.

1076
00:56:13,462 --> 00:56:23,040
Scott: So I have a Panasonic GF two camera, which is a micro four thirds camera, which means it's sort of like a DSLR, but it's not what it has.

1077
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,520
Scott: It's a mirrorless DSLR.

1078
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:27,960
Scott: You know, the way DSLR works is there's a mirror, a physical mirror.

1079
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:33,980
Scott: And you look in the camera and there's light that goes in the lens of the camera on the front hits the mirror.

1080
00:56:34,222 --> 00:56:35,578
Scott: The mirror bounces the light up.

1081
00:56:35,901 --> 00:56:39,160
Scott: There's another mirror that bounces it forward again and sort of like an S shape.

1082
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,120
Scott: And that's how you can look into the viewfinder and see out the front of the camera.

1083
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:49,060
Scott: And when you push the button to take a picture, the mirror moves physically up right out of the way.

1084
00:56:49,321 --> 00:56:56,860
Scott: So if the light coming in the lens hits the sensor, which then records the picture in the olden days, instead of a digital sensor being there, there'd be film.

1085
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:57,281
Scott: Right.

1086
00:56:57,642 --> 00:57:02,520
Scott: So a mirrorless camera, you open it up and you take the lens off and you just see the sensor just fucking right there.

1087
00:57:02,661 --> 00:57:04,339
Scott: It's like, there it is, no mirror in the way.

1088
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:06,940
Scott: And you go, oh, shit, don't let any dust get on that motherfucker.

1089
00:57:07,021 --> 00:57:08,299
Scott: And you know, you close it back up.

1090
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,439
Rym: It's kind of like when you take a CPU out of your motherboard, you're like, I got to put it back.

1091
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,061
Scott: Yeah.

1092
00:57:13,101 --> 00:57:19,360
Scott: So what this means is that the camera, because there's no mirror in there, can be much, much smaller than a DSLR.

1093
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:23,320
Scott: But the quality is almost as good, obviously not as good.

1094
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,460
Scott: Obviously, you can't look into the viewfinder and see out the front of the camera.

1095
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:32,780
Scott: What you see is just a screen on the back like any other digital camera and showing you what the sensor is seeing.

1096
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,061
Scott: Right.

1097
00:57:33,944 --> 00:57:38,480
Scott: You can get a digital viewfinder to get that experience of holding the camera up to your face.

1098
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:41,640
Scott: But inside of that is just a very tiny monitor.

1099
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:44,659
Rym: Well, the holding the camera up to your face stabilizes.

1100
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:51,320
Rym: Well, no, in video especially is actually really important, which is why I spent a lot more money to get the camera I got.

1101
00:57:52,101 --> 00:58:00,240
Rym: Now, it's an old camera now, but when I bought it, the Panasonic HDC HS 700, which Panasonic has gobbledygook bullshit when it comes.

1102
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,059
Rym: There's like a hundred different models of this thing.

1103
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,723
Rym: It's basically a handicam.

1104
00:58:03,783 --> 00:58:09,200
Rym: It's kind of the upper end of prosumer, because anything beyond this is going to be a sort of for real studio camera.

1105
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:11,548
Rym: It's 1080p, 60fps.

1106
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,320
Rym: It actually is pretty good quality, all things considered.

1107
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:17,639
Rym: Pretty much all the ignites video you see is shot with this thing.

1108
00:58:18,421 --> 00:58:19,869
Rym: And it was actually really cheap.

1109
00:58:19,909 --> 00:58:21,579
Rym: I spent like 1200 bucks on it.

1110
00:58:23,902 --> 00:58:30,900
Rym: But it has, and part of the reason why it was expensive, is I can have the slide out screen or I can pull out an eyepiece.

1111
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:34,899
Rym: And inside of there is just a tiny LCD, just a little baby LCD.

1112
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:35,621
Rym: But you know what?

1113
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:41,380
Rym: When you're videoing in a dark room, that shit be useful in a big way.

1114
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:54,980
Rym: Also, if you're videoing in a super sunny situation, if you're videoing where you really need precision and you can't be distracted by just stuff going on around you, that viewfinder is so important to being a good cameraman.

1115
00:58:56,821 --> 00:59:08,580
Scott: But yeah, the Micro Four Thirds camera, the other thing about it, besides being mirrorless, is that the lens mount is this Micro Four Thirds standard, which is somewhat more open.

1116
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:16,900
Scott: I mean, if you can buy a Sony mirrorless camera, the next five and the next seven, the next seven is actually one of the best mirrorless cameras there is, if not the best, even though I hate Sony.

1117
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:23,400
Scott: But the only lenses you can get for that fucker are these handful of Sony lenses, and that's it, because it's got some weird mount.

1118
00:59:23,842 --> 00:59:26,700
Scott: The Micro Four Thirds mount is sort of open-ish.

1119
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,480
Scott: So there's all kinds of crazy things you can buy and there's even all kinds of crazy adapters you can buy.

1120
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:43,060
Scott: So I can go and get like some old ass lens from an old school four thirds camera, get this little adapter and stick it on there, and it'll totally work as long as the camera's in manual mode.

1121
00:59:43,561 --> 00:59:53,420
Scott: So if you want to try out all sorts of weird attachments and things, you know, and you don't want to get the real DSLR action, the Micro Four Thirds is definitely the one.

1122
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:58,967
Rym: Well, see, the reason I said there was a future, because one of my coworkers was like, "Hey, I want to get a camera for my son who thinks he wants to get into photography,".

1123
00:59:58,987 --> 01:00:09,120
Rym: and I've recommended some of the kind of the mid-range Micro Four Thirds Lumixes just because they're a good price point for him, because they're, you know, it's a kid who might not follow on forever.

1124
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:14,320
Rym: You don't want to buy the most expensive camera, but you don't want to buy them point and shoot because then he'll just use the cell camera instead.

1125
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:27,571
Rym: So I found multiple articles of professional photographers in their blogs that were basically saying they have, you know, like $4,000 like crazy DSLRs, but even but more and more.

1126
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:38,260
Rym: in their professional shoots, they're using their Micro Four Thirds cameras, the mirrorless ones, because the ease of use compared to the loss of quality, it's just it's a done deal.

1127
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:52,220
Rym: They get better pictures with the Micro Four Thirds because they carry it with them everywhere, they use it more often, they can set up their studio shots faster, and they just made all these arguments how that's basically the future, and that big form factor is going to slowly disappear.

1128
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,139
Scott: Well, I mean, not for like, you know, some things, but yeah.

1129
01:00:55,820 --> 01:01:01,596
Rym: Well, no, I mean, for some things, like, yes, that like I have in the palm of my hand, a pretty tiny 1080p 60fps camera.

1130
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,236
Scott: Well, I mean, I have a GoPro, that's a pretty tiny 4K, right, whatever camera.

1131
01:01:10,486 --> 01:01:11,660
Rym: So did you get your new GoPro?

1132
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,507
Scott: No, I'm not going to.

1133
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:13,800
Scott: You don't have it in your hand.

1134
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,335
Scott: I'm just saying you don't have 4K.

1135
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:16,820
Scott: I'm saying it exists.

1136
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,380
Rym: In fact, the GoPro only does 1080p 30.

1137
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,699
Scott: The GoPro Hero 2, which we have.

1138
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:22,348
Rym: Yes.

1139
01:01:22,552 --> 01:01:22,756
Scott: Yes.

1140
01:01:23,401 --> 01:01:26,380
Rym: But actually the video on that is not that great because of heavy compression.

1141
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,100
Scott: I use the 720 60.

1142
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:33,100
Rym: This thing, the camera on my hand gets a much more close to native format is much better quality.

1143
01:01:33,661 --> 01:01:40,100
Rym: But this thing is tiny and does crazy, crazy, crazy high quality video compared to what most people have.

1144
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:53,020
Rym: And even if we get to a future where a red style camera is like this, there's still going to be the situation where you need the crazy, gigantic, durable camera, you know, mounted on the helicopter with gyroscopes to do some crazy video.

1145
01:01:53,221 --> 01:01:53,484
Scott: Right.

1146
01:01:53,706 --> 01:01:55,159
Rym: Until we replace all video with CG.

1147
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,400
Scott: But the thing is, like even, you know, the four thirds, it's in, you know, the Lumix, whatever, mirrorless.

1148
01:02:00,561 --> 01:02:05,880
Scott: It's you look at those pictures and you're like, wow, those are really good pictures, way better than cell phones or point and shoots or anything.

1149
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:12,280
Scott: But then I look at some crazy good photography, you look at a DSLR and you're like, well, yeah, not totally the best.

1150
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:18,000
Scott: So there's still a gap there that I would still if I had a DSLR, it would still be way awesome.

1151
01:02:18,283 --> 01:02:18,752
Scott: It's still better.

1152
01:02:18,996 --> 01:02:19,119
Rym: Yeah.

1153
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:27,320
Scott: But at the same time, there's the argument you made that the no, if you just showed that the if you put the two pictures next to each other, people would be able to tell.

1154
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,820
Scott: But if you just showed them, you know, the one picture on its own, people like, wow, awesome pictures.

1155
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,260
Rym: Scott, I see pictures people took with their iPhones and little bullshit lenses.

1156
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,940
Rym: They stuck to them that look better than some professional photographs.

1157
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:38,682
Scott: That's true.

1158
01:02:38,762 --> 01:02:43,760
Scott: People somehow people are able to photography can cover a lot of technology.

1159
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:45,214
Scott: It covers way too much.

1160
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:46,141
Scott: Right.

1161
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:52,260
Scott: It's like people who know what they're doing is they can take these fucking amazing pictures like the shittiest 640 by 480 digital cameras.

1162
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,838
Scott: And it's like, how the fuck did you do that?

1163
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:57,240
Scott: Anything I take with that looks just like a blurry piece of shit.

1164
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:57,867
Scott: You can't even tell.

1165
01:02:57,888 --> 01:02:58,619
Scott: You know what?

1166
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,060
Rym: I don't use anymore printers.

1167
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:01,590
Scott: I have one.

1168
01:03:01,691 --> 01:03:02,400
Rym: I have one.

1169
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:06,820
Rym: Every time I print with it, I got to stand there and shove the paper through because it can't roll properly.

1170
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:07,900
Scott: Mine works just fine.

1171
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:08,998
Scott: I have a brother something.

1172
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,339
Scott: It actually does double sided, the kind where it sucks the paper.

1173
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,259
Rym: I know you do because I have the old Samsung, which you know what?

1174
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,617
Rym: Same ink cartridge.

1175
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:17,959
Rym: Well, toner cartridge.

1176
01:03:18,221 --> 01:03:18,463
Scott: Yeah.

1177
01:03:18,806 --> 01:03:20,420
Scott: Black and white laser printers, everybody.

1178
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:21,265
Scott: Right.

1179
01:03:21,326 --> 01:03:22,639
Rym: How do you use your printer for?

1180
01:03:23,223 --> 01:03:26,620
Rym: Print out a ticket for Megabus because they refuse to look at your cell phone.

1181
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,021
Rym: Right.

1182
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:30,160
Scott: How often do you actually need to print something in color?

1183
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,080
Scott: You can just go to FedEx, Kinko's, whatever the fuck print shop.

1184
01:03:33,201 --> 01:03:33,422
Scott: Right.

1185
01:03:33,845 --> 01:03:36,080
Scott: You rarely, rarely, rarely need to print in color.

1186
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:41,240
Scott: Ninety nine percent of the time you still need to print if you need to print at all ever is going to be black and white.

1187
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:46,320
Scott: Black and white laser gives you the cheapest price per page, the fastest.

1188
01:03:47,142 --> 01:03:49,700
Scott: It's just the best in, you know, for actual.

1189
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:55,740
Scott: So if you need a printer at all, which you should avoid getting, if at all possible, black and white laser printer of some kind.

1190
01:03:56,161 --> 01:04:01,400
Rym: I got the highest grade because the inkjet, if it sits there for a month and then you print, you're going to waste a bunch of ink and there's all this trouble.

1191
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,800
Rym: Inkjets are dead for that kind of thing.

1192
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,103
Scott: Yeah.

1193
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:04,440
Scott: I think inkjets are dead, period.

1194
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:13,000
Scott: I think the only people who really would still get inkjets and things are like if you have kids who are printing out colored things like school projects all the time or some shit.

1195
01:04:13,341 --> 01:04:13,986
Scott: Are you kidding?

1196
01:04:14,047 --> 01:04:15,318
Scott: You know how expensive that would be?

1197
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,085
Scott: Because schools are old.

1198
01:04:17,105 --> 01:04:19,440
Scott: That's the only time in my life I printed a lot of colored things.

1199
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,319
Scott: It was like for high school projects and whatnot.

1200
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,120
Rym: At RIT, I would print out art to stick on my wall.

1201
01:04:24,682 --> 01:04:25,207
Scott: I would do that.

1202
01:04:25,227 --> 01:04:25,307
Scott: Yeah.

1203
01:04:25,973 --> 01:04:26,840
Scott: That's what I was doing at RIT.

1204
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:29,140
Rym: I printed it on photo paper so it looked all glossy.

1205
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:31,340
Scott: Print out a picture of Choo Choo with a white castle.

1206
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,520
Rym: Yup, yup.

1207
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,100
Scott: Various webcomics.

1208
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,120
Rym: I remember that picture.

1209
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:37,520
Rym: I had this crazy CG picture.

1210
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:41,700
Rym: It's like a girl looking up into the like into the moonlight with cherry blossoms.

1211
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:42,340
Rym: It's beautiful.

1212
01:04:43,221 --> 01:04:46,671
Rym: One day this nerd came into my dorm room because he was doing.

1213
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:49,560
Rym: he knew I was in the anime club and that I was running for the board or whatever.

1214
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:55,800
Rym: And he was doing an article for a class and for the school newspaper on like like fans and anime in the school or whatever.

1215
01:04:56,222 --> 01:04:57,740
Rym: And he sees this picture I got printed out.

1216
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:03,440
Rym: He's like, oh, I didn't know you were a fan of and I think he said palette, palette something.

1217
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:05,919
Rym: And I was like, oh, I didn't actually know this picture is from.

1218
01:05:06,461 --> 01:05:09,040
Rym: And then he's like, oh, and he didn't say anything.

1219
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:10,979
Rym: And I was like, is it porn?

1220
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:16,180
Rym: And he was like, yeah, and I was like, are you a fan of it?

1221
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,718
Rym: And you thought I was a fan of it, too.

1222
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,335
Rym: And he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:24,759
Scott: OK, this is going on for a while.

1224
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:25,560
Rym: Want to just stop?

1225
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,740
Scott: But I have a feeling that people want to hear more about the technological things.

1226
01:05:29,001 --> 01:05:30,198
Rym: We'll do another Monday show on it.

1227
01:05:30,605 --> 01:05:31,420
Scott: We should just do Thursday.

1228
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,079
Rym: You know what?

1229
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,440
Rym: I could talk about my Marantz.

1230
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,679
Rym: I got shit to say about that.

1231
01:05:35,103 --> 01:05:36,738
Rym: We should save that for another time, though.

1232
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,254
Rym: Gone over an hour.

1233
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:39,338
Rym: It's done.

1234
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:40,400
Rym: I'm hungry.

1235
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:44,299
Rym: I heard the doorbells of fresh direct came and I want to eat the zucchini bread that's in there.

1236
01:05:44,421 --> 01:05:44,879
Rym: Something fierce.

1237
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,340
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1238
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:57,460

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1244
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,500
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
