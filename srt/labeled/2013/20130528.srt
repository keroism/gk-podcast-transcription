00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,567
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, May 28th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:12,412
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:13,915
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:15,700
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,144
Rym: King of Tokyo.

6
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:20,368
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:24,976
Rym: We're back from anime Boston.

8
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:25,818
Rym: It was a good time.

9
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:29,870
Rym: It was cold as fuck and it rained the entire weekend.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,553
Scott: Yeah, it sucked.

11
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:31,978
Rym: That was the worst.

12
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:34,168
Rym: And I think the worst part of the worst was that.

13
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:37,383
Scott: We come home, we had one good sunny day and now up rain again.

14
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:37,805
Rym: Yep.

15
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:43,124
Rym: But as we left Boston, like literally we're sitting inside on Sunday, like, man, this sucks.

16
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:44,169
Rym: We can't go outside.

17
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:45,938
Rym: We finally are like, fuck it.

18
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:46,963
Rym: Let's just get on our bus.

19
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:50,238
Rym: And as soon as we walk out with our luggage, it's like sunny again.

20
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:51,041
Rym: It's nice out.

21
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:52,266
Rym: Everything's cleaning up.

22
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:53,069
Rym: It's warm again.

23
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:55,478
Rym: But yeah, anime Boston was great.

24
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,719
Rym: If you're looking for coverage of that or anime kind of got to hold out to next Wednesday.

25
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:05,304
Rym: Cause we do four different GeekNights shows and this is the one we did after anime Boston and it's a Tuesday.

26
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:06,950
Rym: So it's gaming.

27
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:07,672
Scott: Okay.

28
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,663
Rym: Talking about games, but a game that we bought at anime Boston.

29
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:20,743
Rym: So I guess the news that we can talk about, that's probably the most interesting when everyone is waiting for us to say something dumb so they can yell at us because our listeners are weird.

30
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:25,596
Rym: Sometimes is the Xbox Xbox one.

31
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:28,626
Scott: You know, I called the other Xbox, the Xbox one.

32
00:01:28,786 --> 00:01:30,693
Scott: So now it's like this two Xbox ones.

33
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:34,948
Rym: I don't like the name one, but then again, I didn't like the name.

34
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:39,024
Rym: We see the thing that bothers me to play your Nintendo revolution.

35
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:43,563
Scott: If I was a game company like Microsoft, it's like everyone just says Xbox, right?

36
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:45,649
Scott: Just call it Xbox.

37
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:47,134
Scott: Apple gets away with it.

38
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:48,237
Scott: Just call every iPad, iPad.

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,014
Scott: And then on Wikipedia, people like third gen, fourth gen, whatever.

40
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:54,399
Scott: Just keep saying Xbox.

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,690
Rym: The problem is if you say Xbox and it isn't backward compatible, some kids are going to buy an Xbox Xbox game and it won't work.

42
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,984
Rym: The reason they do that is because that way they brand in the store.

43
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:09,493
Rym: These are the Xbox 360 games.

44
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:16,640
Rym: So the kid with a regular old Xbox is like, oh man, dad, I need to know why Apple gets away with that on their iPads and iPhones.

45
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:21,584
Scott: because it doesn't matter because the store just won't let you buy apps that won't work on that device.

46
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:26,831
Scott: If they just went, if they're going to go digital and they want this internet connected all the time, just go fucking all digital.

47
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,021
Scott: Throw the disk drive out, throw it out.

48
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:34,803
Rym: So the most exciting thing to me about the Xbox announcement was that the controller looks really good.

49
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:35,807
Rym: Yeah.

50
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:36,650
Scott: I mean, sure.

51
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,713
Scott: If I break one of my existing controllers, that one looks pretty much the same with a non shitty d-pad.

52
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:46,514
Rym: Well, I only own three, so I might buy one of the new one if it'll work with my HTPC.

53
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:52,055
Scott: I'm sure it'll work with your HTPC, but I, I read, I don't think it uses the receiver.

54
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:57,656
Scott: I didn't get a hundred percent details on this, but really downplayed that receiver in general.

55
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:57,917
Scott: Yeah.

56
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,471
Scott: Someone said something about wifi, something like it goes, I don't know.

57
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:10,509
Scott: I don't know how this controller works if it uses the same wireless protocols, the old one or not, but it has pretty much the same buttons and it's mostly the same shape.

58
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:14,842
Scott: and uh, yeah, d-pad that doesn't look like it sucks.

59
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:22,728
Rym: But it seems like they spent a lot of time when they were talking about it, focusing on all the sort of HTPC like things that it'll do.

60
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:30,466
Scott: Oh, you mean the Xbox in general, not Netflix all in one.

61
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:33,096
Rym: This is the thing that'll be connected to your TV.

62
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:34,280
Rym: that does everything.

63
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:48,340
Scott: I mean, if you're a person who is somehow not listening to us and not building an HTPC like you should, and you have too many boxes under your TV, like a Roku and a console, you know, it's actually kind of good if you don't mind paying the fee for it, right?

64
00:03:48,360 --> 00:04:02,812
Rym: You can throw your cable box out and just because one thing I noticed way back with my Xbox was that it did not, if you use like YouTube on that or on a Roku or anything, any device that isn't just an HTPC, you don't see all the videos.

65
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:06,446
Scott: If you do a search, you're done to make an HTPC.

66
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:07,450
Scott: That's what you deal with.

67
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:13,312
Rym: Now, the thing is people were making a lot of fun about the like, Oh, eight gigs of Ram.

68
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:13,653
Rym: Huh?

69
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:17,404
Rym: That's like half of my laptop has, which is true, but it does.

70
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:24,623
Rym: People seem to forget that the Xbox one or the Xbox two even had 512 megabytes.

71
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:25,064
Rym: Yeah.

72
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:31,746
Scott: Game consoles always have less horsepower than PCs because they're not really multitasking.

73
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:37,554
Scott: And the software that is written for them is highly optimized because there's only one hardware thing to target, right?

74
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:44,218
Scott: Like if I read a video game for PC, I have to get that thing to work on any possible GPU that anyone has.

75
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,827
Scott: So I can't really highly optimize it for anyone.

76
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:51,164
Scott: So I'm actually not really getting the most out of the hardware.

77
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,294
Scott: You know, that's what the demo scene is all about.

78
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,693
Scott: The demo scene is like, Holy crap, look what that guy can make an Apple to GS do.

79
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:03,880
Scott: And it looks amazing because you're used to not used to seeing Apple to GS software doing that kind of awesome shit.

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,454
Scott: And it's like, yeah, it's highly optimized for that specific hardware, you know?

81
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:13,715
Scott: So basically every console game there ever is, is demo scene, right?

82
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:16,144
Scott: It basically pushes that specific hardware to the limit.

83
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:21,584
Rym: because the PlayStation three where no one ever really pushed it because it was too hard to push.

84
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:22,066
Scott: Yeah.

85
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:25,114
Scott: I mean, it's a Sisyphusian task.

86
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:25,896
Scott: Exactly.

87
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:28,965
Scott: But the Xbox, not really one thing.

88
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:30,410
Scott: someone did point it out, right?

89
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:38,414
Scott: Who won this console generation, the Wii U, the Xbox one and the PS four all have ATI cards.

90
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:39,136
Rym: Yup.

91
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:49,616
Rym: That was actually a good thing that I didn't notice at first, but is that I would pause it based on no other knowledge that that is AMD cutting some sort of sweet deal to steal that from.

92
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:50,700
Scott: Yeah, obviously right.

93
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,439
Scott: It's not, that doesn't mean ATI is better that you should put it in your computer.

94
00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:02,465
Scott: It's saying that ATI gave them a better deal because they're desperate and it's good enough for all those consoles.

95
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:02,787
Scott: Right.

96
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:07,466
Scott: And you know, for the console people, it doesn't really matter to them which one, right?

97
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,451
Scott: It's, it's going to work.

98
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:18,857
Rym: The people who pay attention to the details of the specs by and large, I think are the PC gamers who are looking at them just to scoff at it and the actual demographic that's going to use the Xbox.

99
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:21,289
Rym: We'll never know or care much about what's inside.

100
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:30,754
Scott: Also those really shallow people who still think there's a console war going on, like the, you know, the 16 bit era, they haven't gotten over it yet or their kids and they, you know, they're having their own.

101
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:34,168
Scott: So they need something to compare these consoles with no games.

102
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:36,597
Scott: So really to me, compare the specs.

103
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:41,071
Rym: Super Nintendo Sega Genesis was actually the last console war, right?

104
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:45,446
Scott: Because that was a time when you couldn't really buy both.

105
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:49,742
Scott: And both of them had drastically different game libraries, right?

106
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:53,098
Scott: There were very big, the number of games on both that were significant.

107
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:54,082
Scott: games were few.

108
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:58,195
Scott: nowadays, you know, it's like, yeah, okay.

109
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,523
Scott: 90% of the games on both these consoles are identical.

110
00:07:00,543 --> 00:07:07,575
Scott: The Xbox is going to have like a couple of games that aren't on the PS for the PC and the PS four is going to have a couple that aren't anything else.

111
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:10,210
Scott: And every other game is going to be in every single platform.

112
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:12,703
Scott: So what the fuck does it matter which one you have?

113
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:16,700
Rym: There's no war unless you want Nintendo where it's all just on Nintendo.

114
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:17,322
Scott: Yeah.

115
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:18,567
Scott: And there's two games also.

116
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:21,558
Rym: So Nintendo, I guess is at eternal war with no one.

117
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:21,658
Rym: Yeah.

118
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:24,946
Rym: Oh, Nintendo anyway.

119
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:29,218
Rym: But yeah, the Xbox I think is going to be the quote unquote.

120
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,047
Rym: winner of this quote unquote.

121
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:47,719
Rym: console generation in the sense that a lot of people made this point that the Wii U does all the things that the nerds online are complaining about in terms of that it doesn't really have the kinds of DRM and always on lock-in stuff.

122
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:48,744
Scott: It has a region lock though.

123
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:51,199
Rym: It does have a region lock, but every console has a region lock.

124
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:55,592
Rym: Except the DS, but even the 3DS has region lock now.

125
00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:56,615
Rym: Seriously, Nintendo?

126
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:57,258
Rym: Really?

127
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:58,762
Rym: Who that fucks?

128
00:07:58,822 --> 00:08:06,285
Rym: the one person who speaks Japanese and English and lives in America and wants to play games from both.

129
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:11,004
Scott: And you still, why don't you know, share a region lock and translate your fucking games.

130
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:15,944
Scott: You know how many amazing fricking games that are for Wii U and Nintendo systems in Japan.

131
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:17,351
Scott: They just don't bring here.

132
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:19,985
Scott: Why do you even bother putting your console out in some other country?

133
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:20,992
Scott: We're not going to put any games out.

134
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:23,485
Rym: They did bring out that Nobunaga Pokemon.

135
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:24,067
Rym: And you know what?

136
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:25,614
Rym: It was pretty shit.

137
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:26,357
Scott: Yeah.

138
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,629
Scott: But there are plenty of other games that are not shit.

139
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,594
Rym: Are they not shit?

140
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:30,640
Rym: Or you just think they're not shakes?

141
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,324
Rym: you haven't played them.

142
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:32,953
Scott: It's not even just Nintendo, right?

143
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:36,529
Scott: Look, the Phoenix Wright game comes out in like three days.

144
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:38,538
Scott: Why is it not a simultaneous release?

145
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,171
Scott: Those have been very successful in the U S and they're not shit.

146
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:43,583
Rym: Have the most recent ones made enough money to be worth it.

147
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:44,548
Scott: I'm sure.

148
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,316
Scott: if that's a Capcom game, first of all.

149
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:46,537
Scott: Right.

150
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:49,616
Scott: And second of all, yeah, I'm pretty sure they made enough money to be worth it.

151
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:51,263
Scott: Cause why do they keep putting out more of them?

152
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:58,627
Rym: But the Xbox, I think just Microsoft still has the best online experience of all the consoles hands down.

153
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,400
Rym: And it'll do a serviceable job as an HTPC.

154
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,227
Rym: If you don't have an HTPC.

155
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:04,649
Scott: Yeah.

156
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:14,251
Scott: I think what they've done, that's, you know, good is that, you know, Nintendo was like, all right, we're going to give up on your hardcore people and just target, you know, this new audience.

157
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:14,834
Scott: Right.

158
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:28,558
Scott: And they didn't realize, I guess that that new audience, you know, will love to buy your consoles like a Christmas present and have fun with it for awhile, but they're not going to be invested in it and continue to keep buying games and sit there and play it and play it and play it.

159
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:32,250
Scott: So it's really just sort of a one-time burst sort of sale.

160
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:32,932
Scott: Right.

161
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:39,377
Scott: So what Xbox is doing is they're giving, they're also giving up on the hardcore audience, quote unquote, right.

162
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:42,649
Scott: Which I guess is people who really, really care about games.

163
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:46,624
Scott: And they're just going for the regular core, which is huge.

164
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:48,010
Scott: It's just, that's all right, fine.

165
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:51,583
Scott: Call the call of duties and the halos and the maddens.

166
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:55,539
Rym: The regular core gamer probably outweighs all other gamers combined.

167
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:59,053
Scott: They just need to add in a console league of legends kind of game.

168
00:09:59,234 --> 00:09:59,816
Scott: And that's it.

169
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:00,720
Rym: Oh my God.

170
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:11,604
Scott: Are they, if Microsoft doesn't make some sort of deal to just have, like, if I had the resources, I would be made, I, you know, I'm telling you a simplified game, MOBA, where you play with a game pad, right.

171
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:19,312
Scott: Will be a huge success, just like a simplified dumbed down FPS known as golden eye or, and, or halo was a huge success.

172
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:24,729
Rym: Now it is interesting that the connect is required included and a big part of this thing.

173
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:33,839
Rym: I'm curious if it, I still feel like the connect is just waggle in the way, like it's not adding anything to gaming.

174
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:42,186
Rym: Every connect game I've ever played has been pretty terrible and had pretty really, really bad actual controls with the connect.

175
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,452
Scott: It adds a little bit to the was okay.

176
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:53,223
Scott: It adds a little bit to the HTPC aspect because you know, you're already not smart enough to build an HTPC.

177
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:57,743
Scott: You're probably not smart enough to handle like 10 remote controls with a million buttons on them.

178
00:10:57,763 --> 00:11:04,917
Rym: You want to play some of these games and HTPC that'll play that level of game right now would be more expensive than the X-Box when it comes out.

179
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:11,086
Scott: Maybe, but the point is if you're not good at the kind of person who can figure out how to use three remote controls, right.

180
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:15,903
Scott: To handle your home theater, just saying X-Box play this show, right?

181
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:18,813
Scott: Might work, especially if it works, which it seems to.

182
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:18,893
Scott: Yep.

183
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:22,771
Rym: But a lot of people seem to be really afraid of the connect being online.

184
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:27,492
Rym: Like suddenly I see all these blog posts of people who were comparing it to 1984.

185
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:29,059
Scott: Well, that was the penny arcade coming.

186
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:29,360
Rym: Yeah.

187
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:37,255
Rym: But as everyone's talking about that and it seems like a lot of the people who are freaking out about it, I went back through their like Tumblr histories or blog histories.

188
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:40,971
Rym: They also were afraid of Google glass and other people wearing it.

189
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:41,513
Scott: Yeah.

190
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:43,280
Rym: I mean, yes, it's a connect.

191
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:44,504
Rym: It's a video camera.

192
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:48,136
Rym: I've got a webcam plugged into almost every computer I use.

193
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,164
Rym: Use those webcams occasionally.

194
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:53,016
Rym: I can't imagine Microsoft doing anything is sinister.

195
00:11:53,257 --> 00:12:00,352
Scott: No, but there were a lot of cases where people had webcams in their computers like, and then they would get hacks or something because they were stupid, right?

196
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:05,833
Scott: And installed some malware or they clicked on something or someone hacks the X-Box.

197
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:06,716
Rym: Exactly.

198
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:07,499
Scott: That's what's good.

199
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:07,740
Scott: It's not.

200
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,669
Scott: Microsoft isn't going to look at you, right?

201
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,956
Scott: They don't give a shit, right?

202
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:17,909
Scott: It's going to be, someone's going to figure out an exploit where they can like type in your X-Box live username and then look at your living room.

203
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,604
Scott: And then Microsoft is going to be the one who gets in trouble.

204
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,575
Scott: Just like Sony got in trouble with their root kit.

205
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:27,536
Rym: To be honest, I think the likelihood of something like that actually happening is pretty low.

206
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,806
Scott: It'll be a tough nut to crack, but if someone goes for it, I think they will succeed at least once and it'll get patched.

207
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:37,264
Rym: I feel like that's number one on Microsoft list of don't let that happen.

208
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:40,240
Scott: It could happen, but you know, it could happen with the current connect.

209
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:48,737
Rym: A lot of people haven't plugged in, but I mean, I, it's funny cause it wasn't that long ago in gig knives, like 2006 we were talking about PC gaming was basically dead.

210
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,665
Rym: I mean, I was thinking about buying a Mac.

211
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:54,821
Rym: We were all console games and portable consoles and that was it.

212
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:56,928
Rym: And then PC gaming had a big resurgence.

213
00:12:57,008 --> 00:13:04,151
Rym: and now the exclusives, PC wins in terms of exclusives was more exclusive.

214
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:10,154
Scott: All these like indie games and weird things you download and all that kind of stuff are the exclusives of the PC.

215
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:13,930
Rym: So I can't, for me as a gamer, there's almost no exclusive.

216
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:15,880
Rym: that'll be on a console that isn't on my PC.

217
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,899
Scott: Do you want to play some gods of war, meh, Forza, Gran Turismo and Halo?

218
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:27,082
Rym: You know, Forza, Gran Turismo, that kind of thing actually would be tempting if there was something else to go with it.

219
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:31,660
Rym: But if I buy just that, I basically bought a really expensive Gran Turismo machine.

220
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,362
Scott: Exactly.

221
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:43,072
Rym: Kind of like how my previous X, my current Xbox 360 basically is a glorified street fighter and Pac-Man CEDX console.

222
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:44,857
Scott: Pac-Man CEDX is on windows eight.

223
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,462
Scott: It's not a windows seven though.

224
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,329
Scott: It's in the Microsoft store or whatever.

225
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:54,551
Scott: And then, uh, street super, the most updated street fighter four is on steam.

226
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:59,517
Scott: However, I imagine if you're looking to play online against people, you're going to find a lot more people playing on X.

227
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,588
Rym: Well, luckily I'm not looking to play online with people.

228
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:01,849
Rym: Yeah.

229
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,075
Scott: So there you go.

230
00:14:03,597 --> 00:14:04,160
Rym: So yeah, we'll see.

231
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:11,423
Rym: I don't think there's going to be much of interest in this so-called console generation console war.

232
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,010
Rym: There's three competing consoles.

233
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,973
Rym: Two of them are going to be pretty much the same and it's going to come down to branding and exclusives.

234
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:21,872
Rym: and you know, kids who self identify as being with one console or with the other.

235
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:27,021
Scott: Call of Duty people, all millions of them are just going to buy Xboxes and play Madden and Call of Duty just like they have in.

236
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:32,006
Scott: Anyway, the one thing I think is going to be interesting, right, is the elimination of the used games, right?

237
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:38,092
Scott: And this is why, you know, regardless of writer first sale argument that we've made a hundred times, right?

238
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:40,442
Scott: Uh, you know, everyone's like, Oh, steam.

239
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:43,279
Scott: Yeah, there's no used games on steam, but they charge you a dollar.

240
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,142
Scott: So you don't even care.

241
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:44,563
Scott: Right.

242
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:45,868
Scott: And this is the thing.

243
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:49,479
Scott: Xbox games like Call of Duty, Madden, right?

244
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,164
Scott: All the kids who don't have a lot of money, which is most of them, like all the ones that read anime Boston, right?

245
00:14:56,626 --> 00:15:04,293
Scott: What they do is they buy $50 video games or get them as presents or something, especially single player ones that have endings.

246
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:12,767
Scott: They beat them, they sell them back to the store and then they buy a new one for like 10, 20 bucks, which is what they can afford, right?

247
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,515
Scott: Because it mean effectively 10, 20 bucks.

248
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:15,660
Scott: So they sold another one back.

249
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,001
Scott: Yep.

250
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:16,503
Scott: Right.

251
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:26,242
Scott: And that's the only way these kids can afford to build a game library or to play a lot of games, you know, is doing this is selling games back and buying new ones.

252
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:34,070
Scott: If you eliminate that ability, each one of those kids is basically going to sit there with his $50 game that he can't sell.

253
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:35,173
Scott: Right.

254
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:45,934
Scott: And he's only going to ever buy like four or five games, like maybe half as many games as they would have bought, which is really, really going to hurt, not the biggest, best games.

255
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:47,760
Scott: Those will all still sell, right?

256
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:57,600
Scott: The same number of consoles will probably still sell, but the games that you buy with the 20 bucks you got for Mario, whatever those low, those less popular games, right?

257
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,346
Scott: Are not going to see as many sales for 50, 60 bucks when the, you know, so it's only the top tier that will sell.

258
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:09,146
Scott: And these kids won't have enough money to buy, you know, two of the lower tier games.

259
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,194
Scott: They'll have to save up twice as long.

260
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:13,343
Scott: So here's one of them.

261
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:18,162
Scott: So the long tail, when there's no used games, it's not going to go away in less.

262
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:21,197
Scott: They do steam pricing where shit is actually fucking cheap.

263
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:22,081
Rym: Here's what I would do.

264
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,166
Rym: This is kind of out there.

265
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:24,673
Rym: If I were, if I had steam

266
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:25,336
Scott: pricing

267
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:37,834
Rym: now, I wouldn't do steam pricing because you can really milk the console, you know, that culture and those people in them, what they're expecting to pay for games, which is funny because you kids pay less for games than we paid in the NES era.

268
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:42,428
Scott: Every single NES game I bought from the best one to the shittiest one was between 40 and 50 and $60.

269
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:49,913
Rym: I paid $75 and these are long time ago dollars for Zelda two on the NES.

270
00:16:49,953 --> 00:16:52,362
Scott: My Zelda two was a gray cartridge only cost me 50.

271
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:53,025
Rym: Mine was gold.

272
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:59,394
Scott: I bought it like way after it came out day one, but like I bought things like you would go to Toys R Us.

273
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:00,118
Scott: You'd look at the shelf.

274
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:00,923
Scott: You wouldn't know what to buy.

275
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:05,223
Scott: I bought like some golf game that wasn't a good one, but I didn't know that wasn't a good one.

276
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:06,690
Scott: And it was 50 bucks.

277
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,633
Rym: Mario three was $65.

278
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:13,252
Scott: The Toys R Us dig dug to 50 bucks, you know, frigging everything 50 bucks.

279
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:13,454
Scott: But

280
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:33,581
Rym: what I would do is set up some sort of system where if there's a game that's one of those second tier games, yeah, it's 50 bucks in the online store or whatever that your parents give you credits from their credit card because kids don't have credit cards and you have to get that sort of online sale from the kids who don't go to game stores anymore because they don't have anything to sell back.

281
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:34,624
Rym: Set it up to where.

282
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:42,006
Rym: if you already own Call of Duty, you get a $20 discount on this list of other games.

283
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:46,881
Rym: And that kicks in like six months after Call of Duty comes out.

284
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:48,567
Scott: Here's the problem with this strategy.

285
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:48,868
Scott: Right.

286
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:53,204
Scott: This strategy might get some sales on those other games.

287
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:53,927
Scott: Right.

288
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:56,859
Scott: But it's only getting $30 sales on those other games.

289
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:57,120
Scott: Right.

290
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,046
Scott: When kids resell their shit to GameStop.

291
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:00,788
Scott: Right.

292
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,160
Scott: Basically, they're buying new copies of that.

293
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,549
Scott: You know, they're buying fifty dollars for that of the game.

294
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,092
Scott: Right.

295
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:13,832
Scott: So even though some of the kids are like, sell a used one, buy a used one.

296
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:14,535
Scott: Right.

297
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,102
Scott: Someone had to sell that used one.

298
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:21,881
Scott: All those full price copies were sold at some point, you know, along the line there.

299
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,303
Scott: Yeah.

300
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:27,000
Rym: Well, you're really fundamentally changing that model of how you sell this.

301
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,666
Scott: There's a lot of math there.

302
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:28,927
Scott: Right.

303
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:37,081
Scott: It's like, OK, if we were now taking the money from all the used copies, the GameStop sales and giving that to the developers, there's the there's the.

304
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:40,734
Scott: all of the original sales of the new copies are going down in price.

305
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,505
Scott: So GameStop obviously is making any money here.

306
00:18:43,545 --> 00:18:49,072
Scott: But how much will the original developer make if their first sales are down, but they get the money back from the use?

307
00:18:49,092 --> 00:19:00,817
Rym: But at the same time, by cutting GameStop entirely out of the picture, you could probably come up with some way to capture a portion of that money that was previously in this sort of low run middleman.

308
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,841
Scott: But here's the other problem with cutting GameStop out of the picture, which they're not actually doing.

309
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:05,323
Scott: Right.

310
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:07,871
Rym: Is well for used stuff.

311
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:09,095
Rym: They are a big game.

312
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,298
Rym: Stop is used stuff.

313
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:10,820
Scott: Yeah.

314
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:14,091
Scott: Is that, you know, kids really only have cash.

315
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:16,038
Scott: They don't have credit cards.

316
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:16,299
Scott: Yeah.

317
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:27,602
Rym: You need to be really good about supporting a way for the parents or the kid to take money and put it into the Xbox account and then the kid can buy a lot of that game got sold to the store.

318
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:33,285
Scott: New game got bought is just kids on their own with whatever money they can scrap together from who knows what.

319
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:33,707
Scott: Right.

320
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:49,925
Rym: If, you know, parents are like approving every single game purchase is going to be a lot less fucking game purchases in total, unless they do the thing where you can buy the card with cash at like Wal-Mart and then use that to buy the game online.

321
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:51,313
Scott: Well, they'll do that all for sure.

322
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:53,083
Scott: But actually, I think they're going to complete.

323
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:54,952
Scott: they're getting rid of Xbox points.

324
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:59,476
Scott: Now it's just going to show you dollars just like steam does, which is exactly what I thought they should have done all along.

325
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:00,059
Rym: I don't know.

326
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,565
Rym: I understand why.

327
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:05,422
Rym: I understand why anyone ever does the points thing because it makes you money.

328
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:07,231
Rym: Yeah, I guess I just don't like it.

329
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:09,582
Rym: I don't agree with it, but I understand why.

330
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:10,124
Rym: Whatever.

331
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,052
Rym: But yeah, not super excited.

332
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:13,317
Rym: Going to keep playing PC stuff.

333
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:13,719
Rym: Yeah.

334
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:17,776
Scott: Considering how my Xbox collects dust is pretty much a Pac-Man CEDX machine.

335
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:18,720
Scott: Not going to buy a new one.

336
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,030
Rym: I haven't turned on my Xbox in six months.

337
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:27,701
Scott: The thing is, if I sold my Xbox, I'd have to sell the other things that go with it, like that rock band guitar that would then become useless.

338
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:29,548
Rym: I don't know any of that shit because I knew better.

339
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:32,882
Scott: My joystick is still good though.

340
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:34,067
Scott: That works with PCs and stuff.

341
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:34,749
Rym: Yeah, that's just USB.

342
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,131
Scott: Yeah.

343
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:39,286
Scott: I got a couple Xbox games to sell off, I guess.

344
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:57,025
Rym: So, speaking of doubling down on PC gaming, it's been a while since I've been in the market for a video card because I built my computer in 2009 and it can still play most of the games today because I built a fucking bad ass computer back in 2009.

345
00:20:57,025 --> 00:21:05,063
Rym: So, a while ago, a long time ago, I upgraded to the GTX 260, which I'm still using.

346
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,891
Rym: I finally hit a problem.

347
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:12,226
Rym: The draw distance and counter strike on some of these large new maps.

348
00:21:12,246 --> 00:21:13,111
Scott: You mean counter strike go?

349
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:14,056
Rym: Counter strike go.

350
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:17,231
Scott: I imagine you can get full frames on hot max settings as counter strike stores.

351
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:24,519
Rym: I can't see in the windows of the lake house from the furthest edges of the map because of my draw distance.

352
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,971
Scott: Even if you use the sniper rifle and zoom in double time?

353
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:28,841
Rym: Yeah, the draw distance is inside of that.

354
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:30,007
Scott: It just shows you a black square.

355
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,822
Rym: I see a gray square in the window and I can't see anything.

356
00:21:32,862 --> 00:21:33,565
Scott: Even if someone's in there?

357
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:33,685
Scott: Yup.

358
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:34,569
Scott: And you zoomed in?

359
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,971
Scott: Yup.

360
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:35,654
Scott: Whoa.

361
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:38,990
Rym: So, I've been waiting for a while to upgrade my video card.

362
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,241
Scott: What if you just turned the settings up?

363
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:42,504
Scott: Do you just lose too many frames?

364
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:44,289
Rym: Yeah, it's unplayable.

365
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:58,297
Rym: So, basically, I was needing a new video card anyway as well because I do a lot more video editing than I used to and my current video card cannot show me four rendered effects simultaneously.

366
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:04,362
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I got the 680 and if I do premiere, pretty much everything is always rendered in the preview render.

367
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:08,534
Scott: Yeah, when I have like four scaled sets of hour long footage.

368
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:12,365
Scott: As long as the full way across the sequence.

369
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:14,672
Rym: So, the 780 came out.

370
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:15,214
Rym: The GTX 780.

371
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:19,408
Scott: Can you actually buy one now or is it just like announced announced?

372
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:20,351
Rym: It's on Newegg.

373
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:20,953
Rym: It's 650 bucks.

374
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:25,289
Scott: Whoa, I mean, I just looked up mine before the show.

375
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,001
Scott: I bought a 680 like a year ago, maybe a little over a year ago.

376
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:29,268
Rym: So, yeah, my plan was to wait.

377
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:30,757
Scott: For 500 and it's still 500.

378
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:36,077
Rym: Was to wait for the 700 series to come out and then buy a 680 at a substantial discount.

379
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:38,707
Rym: So, I gotta wait and see when that discount will come.

380
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:39,832
Rym: I think it's not.

381
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:45,229
Rym: I think the 680 is not actually going to drop in price until the 760 comes out.

382
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:49,822
Rym: I might just buy the 780 because it's only 650 bucks.

383
00:22:49,923 --> 00:22:54,857
Scott: It's only twice as much as Xbox one is probably going to be.

384
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:02,991
Rym: I think the Xbox one, if I had to guess, having not read a lot of news about it, like detailed news about pricing, I'm going to guess 500.

385
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:03,874
Rym: Really?

386
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:07,953
Scott: I think because of the connect and all that, I don't think you're going to see too many sales at 500.

387
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:12,759
Scott: Remember, they got to have some sort of cheap version, like with the Xbox 360, the arcade edition.

388
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:13,261
Scott: That was all.

389
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:15,150
Rym: I would expect there to be a more ghetto version.

390
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,888
Rym: But what's the deal with the connect and all that other stuff in there?

391
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,904
Rym: It seems like you can't sell it without the connect and stuff just won't work.

392
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:25,603
Scott: You sell consoles at a loss, man, especially, you know, the used game thing.

393
00:23:25,623 --> 00:23:27,090
Scott: You got to sell the console loss.

394
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:27,893
Scott: Right.

395
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:30,002
Scott: So it's got to be three or four hundred.

396
00:23:30,404 --> 00:23:31,509
Scott: three hundred for the cheap one.

397
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:32,614
Scott: Right.

398
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:33,800
Scott: Otherwise, how are you going to forget?

399
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,166
Scott: No one's going to buy it at five hundred.

400
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:36,151
Scott: Only crazy people.

401
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:36,533
Rym: Yes.

402
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,437
Scott: We'll see the PS3.

403
00:23:37,477 --> 00:23:41,839
Rym: They sold it for like way too much money and still kind of worked out as a popular console.

404
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,951
Scott: Kind of, you know, they would have done a lot.

405
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:46,664
Scott: You know, people went crazy, though, when they saw how expensive it was.

406
00:23:46,684 --> 00:23:46,924
Rym: Wow.

407
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:50,495
Rym: So, yeah, people talking about the price.

408
00:23:51,798 --> 00:24:01,028
Rym: The estimates are all over, but a lot of people are saying four hundred five hundred based on the last thirty five seconds of googling.

409
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:02,936
Scott: OK, we'll see what happens.

410
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:03,880
Rym: Yeah, we will see what happens.

411
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,957
Rym: But yeah, I mean, the seven eighty is useless unless you're a nerd.

412
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:10,004
Rym: Use your computer for a ton of stuff and need video.

413
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,834
Scott: But it's basically even for gaming.

414
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:15,484
Scott: I have a six eighty every single game.

415
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,716
Scott: I can get full frames at full resolution with Mac settings.

416
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:21,665
Scott: So a seven eighty for gaming or like S.L.I.

417
00:24:21,686 --> 00:24:23,230
Scott: for gaming is fucking stupid.

418
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:29,089
Rym: But I have alternative use cases of lots of video effects for gaming.

419
00:24:29,189 --> 00:24:29,792
Scott: Exactly.

420
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:32,160
Rym: The thing is, I'm getting close to the point.

421
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,060
Rym: I think another year is the longest I can hold out on this computer before I upgraded.

422
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,308
Scott: I usually get new computers every five years.

423
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:39,693
Scott: That's so you said 2009.

424
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:41,982
Scott: Yeah, it's twenty thirteen.

425
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:43,085
Scott: I know.

426
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:43,847
Rym: I know.

427
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:46,997
Rym: The thing is, my computer is still super powerful.

428
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:47,559
Scott: Yeah.

429
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:51,620
Scott: I think the thing is, remember, I bought usually I buy a computer in eight hundred dollar range.

430
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:51,941
Scott: Right.

431
00:24:52,343 --> 00:24:54,671
Scott: This time I bought I seven six eighty.

432
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:57,722
Scott: I expect this to last six, seven years, not five years.

433
00:24:58,224 --> 00:24:59,929
Rym: I've got the old nomenclature.

434
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,534
Rym: I seven nine twenty.

435
00:25:01,554 --> 00:25:02,196
Rym: OK.

436
00:25:02,256 --> 00:25:03,480
Rym: From the old standard.

437
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,002
Scott: I guess I have something.

438
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:05,984
Scott: I've something.

439
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:06,565
Scott: I don't know.

440
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:07,587
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

441
00:25:13,037 --> 00:25:15,582
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

442
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:23,040
Rym: This is a collection of pictures of Klein bottles in all sorts of different.

443
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,208
Rym: Here's a knitted Klein bottle.

444
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:27,939
Rym: Here's a toy that's set up like a Klein bottle.

445
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:29,324
Rym: You can crawl inside of it.

446
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,892
Rym: I guess it doesn't turn you inside out like a proper one would.

447
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:38,175
Rym: Crazy glass work, triple, quadruple, quintuple Klein bottles.

448
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:40,543
Rym: If you don't know what a Klein bottle is, just go to the website.

449
00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:41,326
Rym: You'll figure it all out.

450
00:25:41,948 --> 00:25:45,380
Scott: OK, so OS game clones dot com.

451
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,898
Scott: This site tries to gather open source re-implementations of great old games in one place.

452
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:53,192
Scott: If you think that some information is GitHub something, something.

453
00:25:53,613 --> 00:26:04,291
Scott: So, yeah, this site basically lists all the open source clones of games such as, you know, I guess they even, you know, Scum VMs on here, FreeSieve, Marathon.

454
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:07,541
Scott: There's an open RA, which is some sort of red alert clone.

455
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:25,420
Scott: There's something called DX and D2X or Descent clones is, I guess it lists things also like engines like ZDoom, his open Dune, like the, you know, the RTS keeper FX and it even tells you like sporadic development, active development, moderate active development.

456
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:31,285
Rym: Like even got inspirational games, like people are making these sort of spiritual successors to dead old franchise.

457
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:31,626
Rym: Yeah.

458
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:36,465
Scott: For star control to, of course, it lists, these look like they're really low rent.

459
00:26:36,606 --> 00:26:39,659
Scott: Well, yes, almost all of these that I've ever played in my life.

460
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:42,028
Scott: I've played a lot of open source.

461
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:52,025
Scott: Yeah, I've played a lot of open source clones of games and they're all pretty much just like ghetto versions for, you know, they tend to have terrible UIs and bad graphics.

462
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:57,460
Scott: Yes, but they are mostly mechanically identical to the original games.

463
00:26:58,002 --> 00:27:01,378
Scott: You know, I think someone actually got FreeSieve working in a browser.

464
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:04,114
Scott: So you can just like go to the website and play FreeSieve, which isn't too bad.

465
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:04,657
Rym: Yeah, it is.

466
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:05,702
Rym: Have you played FreeSieve?

467
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:06,304
Scott: Yeah, it's awful.

468
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:06,706
Rym: Yeah.

469
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:11,222
Rym: I mean, take the Sieve 2 experience, but make it more obtuse.

470
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:12,285
Scott: But in a browser.

471
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,562
Rym: I could play it in a browser with some sort of browser DOS emulator.

472
00:27:18,986 --> 00:27:24,985
Scott: Anyway, this is pretty interesting, you know, especially if you want to work on one of these games, right?

473
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:32,994
Scott: Maybe turn it into not a piece of shit or, you know, the ones that are just engines like ScumVM and such, right?

474
00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:36,166
Scott: Oh, this is the X4, whatever it is that lets you play Ultima 4.

475
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,597
Rym: Yeah, I think this is a treasure trove.

476
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:40,828
Scott: There's gonna be some on here you didn't know about.

477
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:45,172
Rym: This is mostly for aspiring developers because half these projects are dead and have the worst.

478
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:48,773
Scott: It's funny that most of them actually say active development on this site at least.

479
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:55,014
Rym: Yeah, but then you go to them and it's like last push of code 2012.

480
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:56,017
Rym: I've been clicking through these.

481
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:57,000
Rym: They're not looking so good.

482
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,103
Scott: Not to look so good.

483
00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:00,350
Rym: Super Mario war.

484
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,280
Rym: So Mario war is about super Mario multiplayer game.

485
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,370
Rym: The goal is to stomp as many other Marios as possible.

486
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:08,698
Scott: That's not really a clone.

487
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:10,384
Rym: That's just inspired by.

488
00:28:10,404 --> 00:28:11,187
Rym: it's in that section.

489
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,113
Scott: Okay, sure.

490
00:28:13,515 --> 00:28:14,578
Rym: Oh, here's the source code.

491
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:16,123
Rym: Development is halted.

492
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:17,307
Rym: No updates since 2010.

493
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:22,043
Scott: Well, it's at least it says on OS game clones dot com development halted.

494
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,191
Rym: Yeah, so I went to the website.

495
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:24,652
Rym: It's halted.

496
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:25,154
Rym: Okay.

497
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:29,409
Scott: Xcom series, UFO, alien invasion, active development.

498
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:31,377
Scott: Let's see what this looks like.

499
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:32,180
Scott: Is there a screenshot?

500
00:28:32,922 --> 00:28:33,864
Scott: There is a screenshot.

501
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:34,605
Scott: It was a look.

502
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:41,762
Scott: It looks like system shock to level graphics on an X com.

503
00:28:42,465 --> 00:28:42,705
Rym: Huh?

504
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:44,009
Scott: Huh?

505
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:48,224
Scott: You know, with the sort of really polygon ish three d where the sharp edges on everything.

506
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:48,646
Rym: Yeah.

507
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:50,333
Rym: Oh, he's, he dooms on here.

508
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:50,936
Rym: Yeah.

509
00:28:50,956 --> 00:28:51,700
Rym: I don't want to play doom.

510
00:28:52,401 --> 00:28:53,383
Scott: Who doesn't want to play doom?

511
00:28:53,423 --> 00:28:54,325
Scott: I love doom.

512
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:55,788
Rym: I always forget how great doom is.

513
00:28:55,828 --> 00:29:02,831
Rym: So in the banks we're going to, I'm going to start reading it soon.

514
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:04,402
Rym: It's got already finished it while ago.

515
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:08,643
Rym: I've been busy, but there's a lot of rain coming up and I got a bunch of travel coming up and stuff.

516
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,627
Rym: So I'll probably reading a lot.

517
00:29:10,952 --> 00:29:12,880
Rym: Uh, yeah, we were at anime Boston.

518
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,412
Rym: We did not one, not two, not three, not four, but five panels.

519
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:16,477
Rym: Most of them were full.

520
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,589
Rym: I'm sorry to any of you who couldn't get into them.

521
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:26,230
Scott: We will put video of some of them online maybe whenever I get around to it, except for that one where the cosplay guy was holding this cosplay sticks up in front of the camera.

522
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:26,873
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

523
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:31,912
Rym: I think the only one I have really good video of is the last one we did, which is probably the best one.

524
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:36,725
Rym: And uh, yeah, next up Connecticut in July.

525
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:38,249
Scott: Oh shit.

526
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,018
Rym: And then PAX Australia also in July.

527
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:51,186
Rym: And man, in fact, the week after me, we are literally running the panels and workshops department, all 14 panel rooms across three days.

528
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:52,810
Rym: Jesus Christ, there's a lot of panels.

529
00:29:53,512 --> 00:30:00,971
Rym: And then at PAX Australia, I guess we're not omega knots.

530
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:03,678
Scott: I didn't buy a badge.

531
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,582
Scott: I can't be an omega knot.

532
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:04,944
Scott: Yeah.

533
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:12,076
Rym: I assume they only look at people who bought normal badges for the omega-thon and I assume they only look at people who buy a four day badge.

534
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:12,799
Rym: Yeah.

535
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,547
Rym: If you buy just a Friday badge, that wouldn't make sense.

536
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:22,160
Rym: So yeah, I guess with packs having mostly single day badges, I guess only the people who bought a four day badge are eligible.

537
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:22,963
Rym: Hmm.

538
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:23,545
Scott: Interesting.

539
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:24,469
Rym: That's what I would assume.

540
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,557
Rym: I will ask them cause I'm curious now.

541
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:27,160
Rym: Hmm.

542
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,589
Rym: I'll bet it's that anyway.

543
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:30,232
Rym: Yeah, that's it.

544
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:35,975
Scott: Are they going to have the omega-thon finale on Sunday and then Monday, no megathon, maybe daddy to omega-thon.

545
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:37,320
Scott: What's the closing ceremony?

546
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:38,123
Rym: I don't know.

547
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:44,492
Scott: I still think they should add, especially at PAX Prime where they have four days, they should have a pro megathon, right?

548
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:46,320
Scott: The omega-thon is keeping away.

549
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,083
Scott: It is perfect.

550
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:53,951
Scott: They have a pro megathon where it's like, you got to play the hardcore games, fighting game, RTS, FPS.

551
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,798
Rym: Well, if you're going to do that, do it like Tetris.

552
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:59,570
Rym: You have an online system with tryouts during the year.

553
00:30:59,590 --> 00:30:59,670
Rym: Yeah.

554
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:02,659
Scott: It should be, you know, pros only, right?

555
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:07,482
Scott: Let's see, you know, who the best omega knot is and then let's see who the best pro megaton right now.

556
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:08,369
Rym: You know what we're doing right now?

557
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,368
Rym: The thing that Luke Crane hates that, you know, you should do, you know, you should do, you know, you should do anyway.

558
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:25,338
Rym: Anyway, so at anime Boston, of course, kinetic con the convention, we run the panels and workshops department for also is at other cons selling games and we were hanging out with them.

559
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:27,266
Scott: Yeah, they own, there's a game store.

560
00:31:27,306 --> 00:31:31,586
Scott: The game store is actually called kinetic con like member and tournament center.

561
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:32,430
Scott: It's in Connecticut.

562
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,996
Rym: So I always forget that we get a big staff discount and king of Tokyo, that Richard Garfield game was just sitting there.

563
00:31:38,017 --> 00:31:38,378
Rym: Yeah.

564
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,710
Scott: So I was like talking about this game for a long time.

565
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,996
Scott: I see it played everywhere.

566
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:49,503
Scott: It's got a good theme, like basically the theme of rampage, same theme and a shot up the board game geek rankings.

567
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:50,648
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's way up there.

568
00:31:50,688 --> 00:31:51,994
Scott: Let me see exactly where it is.

569
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:52,717
Rym: Yup.

570
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:54,243
Rym: It has average rating of 7.45.

571
00:31:54,243 --> 00:31:54,724
Rym: It's ranked 108.

572
00:31:54,724 --> 00:32:01,064
Rym: I think it, I think it's actually higher on the actual straight up list.

573
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:02,208
Rym: No, on the straight up list.

574
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:05,217
Rym: It's 108 on the family game list.

575
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:06,320
Rym: It's 16.

576
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,163
Scott: Whoa, that's pretty good.

577
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:11,798
Scott: Like that's every board game fucking ever 16 family games.

578
00:32:11,898 --> 00:32:13,845
Scott: Like, wow, that's, that's a bit.

579
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:24,681
Rym: I want to take it aside because this game king of Tokyo and several other games that are like it that have come out in recent history are all just Yahtzee with a twist.

580
00:32:25,563 --> 00:32:26,626
Rym: Not saying that's bad.

581
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:31,540
Rym: I'm saying almost everyone we've talked to has never played Yahtzee.

582
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:32,660
Scott: Right.

583
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:34,427
Scott: So let's list the games that are.

584
00:32:34,468 --> 00:32:37,178
Rym: get through your life and not run into Yahtzee.

585
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:43,779
Rym: Yahtzee is like one under monopoly and one above candy land in terms of basic games.

586
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,162
Rym: Everyone plays with here.

587
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:50,963
Scott: The games that are just like Yahtzee, uh, roll through the ages, not through the ages, but roll through the ages.

588
00:32:50,983 --> 00:32:52,769
Scott: Uh, skyline.

589
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:53,672
Scott: Was that the one?

590
00:32:53,692 --> 00:32:53,833
Scott: Yeah.

591
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:54,375
Rym: Skyline.

592
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:54,756
Scott: All right.

593
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:01,815
Rym: Uh, what was the game I played at anime Boston where you colonize the planet?

594
00:33:02,617 --> 00:33:03,038
Scott: I forget.

595
00:33:03,138 --> 00:33:04,282
Scott: You forget in frontier.

596
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:04,804
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:05,647
Scott: Is that Yahtzee?

598
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:05,948
Rym: Yeah.

599
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:06,510
Rym: That's Yahtzee.

600
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,153
Scott: Okay.

601
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:07,875
Scott: Yeah.

602
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:13,249
Scott: Uh, there's just tons of games that are all actually just Yahtzee.

603
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:17,820
Scott: Uh, I guess, you know, zombie dice is sort of Yahtzee.

604
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,221
Scott: ish.

605
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,028
Scott: Not exactly, but sort of.

606
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:20,751
Rym: Yeah.

607
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:21,936
Rym: Basically these are the games.

608
00:33:22,096 --> 00:33:30,910
Rym: It is alien frontiers from before where you roll a bunch of dice, usually five, and then you pick which ones you want to keep and reroll the rest and do that twice.

609
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,599
Scott: It's basically the same mechanic as draw poker.

610
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,943
Scott: Only you get to draw twice.

611
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:39,637
Rym: And it's, I mean, Yahtzee has been around forever.

612
00:33:39,757 --> 00:33:47,822
Rym: Yahtzee is one of those old as games that super studied ever, at least I assume until recently everyone I'd ever met had played it.

613
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:54,835
Rym: And suddenly, you know, I'm introducing these games to people and I'm like, oh yeah, it's basically Yahtzee, but with a, an attack component.

614
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:56,442
Rym: And they're like Yahtzee, what do you mean?

615
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:58,086
Rym: The guy that talks about games online.

616
00:33:58,107 --> 00:33:58,909
Rym: And I'm like, what the fuck?

617
00:33:58,949 --> 00:33:59,932
Scott: What the fuck is wrong?

618
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:05,230
Scott: So basically what Yahtzee games come down to is, you know, is probability, right?

619
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,679
Scott: And there's different combinations of the die.

620
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:11,132
Scott: results will result in different scores or points or whatever.

621
00:34:11,212 --> 00:34:13,382
Scott: So you need to know what you need, right?

622
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:15,672
Scott: In terms of score, you want more points generally.

623
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:20,149
Scott: And, you know, all of them have different odds, high scoring things.

624
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:27,375
Scott: And if the game is well designed, have low odds and things that score low are very easy to roll, relatively speaking in terms of percentages.

625
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:31,991
Scott: But you roll all the dice initially and you see what your results are.

626
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:42,340
Scott: And thus you need to calculate, aha, knowing that my first roll, now I can see certain scoring possibilities are more or less likely.

627
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:46,737
Scott: Something that might be more points might actually be more likely than something that is less points.

628
00:34:47,138 --> 00:34:51,493
Scott: Given the dice I have already rolled, like I've already got three sixes.

629
00:34:52,054 --> 00:34:55,023
Scott: So rolling two sixes on two dice, right?

630
00:34:55,804 --> 00:35:04,836
Scott: And with two chances to roll them, that's pretty likely right now, actually, you know, whereas it was incredibly unlikely when I rolled just all the dice to begin with.

631
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:15,394
Rym: So any game that has that mechanic of roll dice, pick some and do the poker thing until you have your set and then deploy the set in some fashion onto board or a score sheet.

632
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:25,630
Rym: If you play Yahtzee until you can play it basically perfectly where the winner is basically random based on the look of the dice, you'll be good at all of those games.

633
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:28,341
Rym: Because once you master that, that's the core of the game.

634
00:35:28,382 --> 00:35:37,596
Rym: And all the other stuff is just increasingly obtuse ways of actually maximizing the role after you roll it or understanding what is worth more points in the game.

635
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:39,747
Rym: Like Alien Frontier is worth noting.

636
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:41,996
Rym: I played Alien Frontiers for the first time at Anime Boston.

637
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:46,530
Rym: And yeah, I just played Yahtzee and I won by so much.

638
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,675
Rym: It was ridiculous, right?

639
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:55,754
Scott: Like if I play Yahtzee against some kid, like a middle school or high school kid, at least understand what's going on, unless they're the really smart kid, you know, I'm just going to win.

640
00:35:56,015 --> 00:35:58,446
Rym: If Scott and I play, we might as well just flip a card.

641
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:02,764
Scott: Me and Rym play, let's just post to keep taking the score sheets over and over again.

642
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:11,990
Scott: It's probably going to come out to 50% winning after a trivia in the standard standard officially published rules of Yahtzee.

643
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,835
Rym: What is the maximum possible score?

644
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:18,269
Scott: I think you can only get a certain number of Yahtzees.

645
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:18,670
Scott: Yes.

646
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,252
Scott: Right.

647
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:19,976
Rym: Do you know how many?

648
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:20,800
Rym: Cause I had to look it up.

649
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,604
Rym: I did not remember.

650
00:36:21,624 --> 00:36:23,292
Scott: I believe I'm trying to remember.

651
00:36:23,372 --> 00:36:31,136
Scott: I think that my Yahtzee score sheets that I had when I was a kid official ones said, I got a triple Yahtzee.

652
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:33,444
Scott: You would get like 500 or something.

653
00:36:33,545 --> 00:36:34,428
Rym: Triple Yahtzee.

654
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:35,411
Rym: That was a different game.

655
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:35,953
Scott: Was it?

656
00:36:36,114 --> 00:36:36,455
Scott: Yes.

657
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:38,462
Scott: Oh, I guess we had triple Yahtzee.

658
00:36:38,602 --> 00:36:44,422
Scott: Cause if you had three Yahtzee's in one game, you would score a triple Yahtzee to get many hundreds.

659
00:36:44,944 --> 00:36:45,224
Scott: Right.

660
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:46,408
Scott: And then, right.

661
00:36:46,428 --> 00:36:48,679
Scott: So that you could act, you could keep filling those up.

662
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,180
Scott: And basically what would happen is if you manage to get enough Yahtzee's you wouldn't X out your Yahtzee hole.

663
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:58,104
Scott: So you would keep rolling even after everyone else had filled their score sheets and you could keep going and going.

664
00:36:58,144 --> 00:37:05,670
Rym: So in the standard game, there are 13 chips and you can get on chip for every additional Yahtzee you get.

665
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:14,710
Rym: So if you get all 13 and you max out the rest of the game, your maximum total score is 1,575.

666
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,790
Scott: Okay.

667
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:15,494
Scott: That sounds about right.

668
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:16,438
Rym: Unless Wikipedia.

669
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:21,520
Scott: I remember good Yahtzee scores would be in like the high 800, nine hundreds or low thousands.

670
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:21,862
Scott: Yup.

671
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:23,750
Scott: You know, if you got a Yahtzee that's a hundred.

672
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:30,338
Rym: Seriously, in general, if you want to be good at games, and I feel I'm going to add this to our panels for the next time we talk about this stuff.

673
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:38,770
Rym: Yahtzee itself is, while it's not a good game for people who know better, it is a great game to learn a lot of the basic skills of gaming.

674
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:39,130
Scott: Yeah.

675
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:48,454
Scott: You're not going to be good at games unless you can master Yahtzee and Yahtzee is so transparent and easy to master just because it's not trying to hide or conceal anything with theme or anything like that.

676
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:54,590
Scott: So if you just play a lot of Yahtzee and so you've mastered it, then you're going to be really good at all these other games we're talking about.

677
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:58,506
Rym: It teaches you sort of opportunity costs about, it teaches you odds.

678
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:04,229
Rym: It teaches you when you're falling behind, you've got to go for things that are less and less likely to catch up.

679
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:09,389
Rym: The hail Mary, the game, it also teaches you dice rolling and jigaboo jonesing.

680
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:11,455
Rym: Cause you roll in that cup.

681
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:20,470
Rym: I learned how to cheat as a kid by swirling the dice at the end or putting them in having two dice that I swirl while one's banging around in the middle.

682
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:22,438
Rym: And then immediately flipping the cup over.

683
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:27,461
Rym: I could consistently give myself three of a kind or really good odds and getting along straight.

684
00:38:27,803 --> 00:38:30,556
Scott: We had, I had basically like, I didn't have the whole game.

685
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:31,963
Scott: I had like remnants of the game.

686
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:37,889
Scott: Cause I think it was my great uncles and it was mad old and decrepit, but it was basically from the pieces left over.

687
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:43,450
Scott: I could tell it was, had these orange dice and a cup and sort of a blue tray similar to Yahtzee tray.

688
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:47,605
Scott: But all the dice had letters on them for spelling.

689
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:47,826
Scott: Yeah.

690
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:49,792
Scott: I don't remember what the name of the game was.

691
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:50,454
Scott: Yeah.

692
00:38:50,474 --> 00:38:53,320
Scott: Let me see if I can find it on a board game geek.

693
00:38:54,062 --> 00:39:04,930
Rym: King of Tokyo is at its core Yahtzee, but instead of deploying your dice to points, you deploy your dice to sort of one of three areas.

694
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,421
Rym: You can either build up energy to buy super powers.

695
00:39:08,822 --> 00:39:15,862
Rym: You can attack other players directly to kick them out of the game, or you can acquire victory points.

696
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:22,722
Rym: And the way the game ends is if you get 20 victory points, you win, everyone else loses game over.

697
00:39:23,465 --> 00:39:29,422
Rym: If you are the last man standing before anyone has gotten 20 victory points, you win game over.

698
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:31,849
Rym: So it adds that element.

699
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:33,314
Rym: It's not a great game.

700
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,919
Rym: It's eminently solvable.

701
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:40,059
Rym: The odds, once you figure them out and once you know the strategy, there's not a lot going on there.

702
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,446
Rym: It ends up having chip taking game elements with the attacking, but the way it gets around that is very elegant.

703
00:39:46,506 --> 00:39:50,680
Rym: It's a very sort of, I can see why this is a Richard Garfield game.

704
00:39:51,383 --> 00:40:00,334
Rym: So the way it works is you roll your dice, and if you get the claws, which lets you attack, if you're in Tokyo, you do damage to everyone who's not in Tokyo.

705
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:05,270
Rym: If you're not in Tokyo, you only do damage to the person who's in Tokyo.

706
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:14,538
Rym: When you take damage and you're in Tokyo, you have the option to stay the fuck there anyway, or to concede Tokyo to whoever hits you.

707
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:21,438
Rym: If you stay in Tokyo all the way until your next turn, you get two victory points for remaining in Tokyo.

708
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,513
Rym: So the game has this sort of sunk cost fallacy, "Do I hold

709
00:40:26,754 --> 00:40:26,895
Rym: out?"

710
00:40:27,497 --> 00:40:29,182
Rym: or "Oh, I've taken too much damage.

711
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:30,126
Rym: I've got a bail.

712
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,317
Rym: How much am I willing to risk on the next person's roll?

713
00:40:33,718 --> 00:40:36,788
Rym: Do I go for fucking other people or victory points on my

714
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:37,090
Rym: own?".

715
00:40:37,832 --> 00:40:48,658
Rym: It adds just enough to where it's a good game to play as the light warm-up game before your real game, because it takes 20 minutes to play this game, and it takes five minutes to teach this game.

716
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,686
Scott: I found the word Yahtzee.

717
00:40:50,786 --> 00:40:55,687
Scott: It's Spill and Spell, also known as Scribbage, which is now I guess known as Word Yahtzee.

718
00:40:56,009 --> 00:40:57,939
Scott: But yeah, this is the exact one that I had.

719
00:40:57,979 --> 00:40:59,910
Scott: See it here with these orange dice and the cup?

720
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,038
Rym: I've never seen that in my life.

721
00:41:02,178 --> 00:41:07,325
Scott: Yeah, there's apparently fuck tons of versions of it called Spill and Spell, Scribbage, and Word Yahtzee.

722
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:08,089
Scott: So there you go.

723
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,323
Rym: So I don't know, what do you think of King of Tokyo?

724
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:12,229
Rym: Because you played it with me.

725
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:17,350
Scott: Well, King of Tokyo I think has some really elegant elements to it, right?

726
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:22,610
Rym: The fact that the chip taking is based on are you in or out as opposed to I'm attacking this player.

727
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:26,169
Scott: Right, it's basically you're forced into Tokyo, right, if you don't want to be.

728
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:34,081
Scott: And then it's like, you know, you basically either leave as soon as someone rolls a claw on purpose because you're going to die.

729
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:35,850
Rym: Or you hold out to the bitter fucking end.

730
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:40,608
Scott: If you're going to stay in there, you got to stay in there until it's your turn.

731
00:41:40,729 --> 00:41:42,495
Scott: Unless something freakish happens, right?

732
00:41:42,515 --> 00:41:49,345
Scott: Like maybe, you know, somebody rolls like four claws and it's like, okay, I didn't think it would roll four claws, right?

733
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:51,976
Scott: I thought I could make it around with my 10 health, but I guess not.

734
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:54,646
Scott: So I'm going to pull out now, right?

735
00:41:55,388 --> 00:42:10,447
Scott: But even then, if you get down in your health from like a four claw roll when you're in Tokyo and you're out of Tokyo, the person who just went in, you know, uh, if they gave it becomes to, you know, whoever's in Tokyo, if they roll and do some damage, that might kill you off.

736
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,480
Scott: So think of this, they're not safe, but you need to roll hard.

737
00:42:13,882 --> 00:42:15,510
Rym: If you're in Tokyo, it's like King of the Hill.

738
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,139
Rym: You're getting points for being in the King of the Hill place.

739
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:24,362
Rym: But instead of basically now, every other player is doing damage only to you.

740
00:42:24,382 --> 00:42:27,132
Rym: Well, if you're in Tokyo, you're doing damage to everyone else.

741
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:34,340
Rym: So when you're in Tokyo, you're effectively getting an analog to victory points by doing damage because you're taking everyone else down equally.

742
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:40,702
Rym: But if anyone attacks you, they're all attacking just you and knocking you out of the game.

743
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:41,364
Scott: Yep.

744
00:42:42,447 --> 00:42:47,203
Rym: I think the strategy, having only played it a few times is to stay the fuck out of Tokyo.

745
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:51,944
Scott: I agree because the first game I played, I stayed the fuck out of Tokyo and I ended up winning.

746
00:42:51,964 --> 00:42:55,680
Scott: And the second game I was stay in a few times to get points and I just died.

747
00:42:55,901 --> 00:42:57,849
Rym: Now, I wouldn't go for damage either.

748
00:42:57,949 --> 00:42:59,495
Rym: I'd let other players do that.

749
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:06,021
Rym: Of course, then it's a bringsmanship game, but I would go for energy to buy the superpowers and also a victory point.

750
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,914
Rym: Just get is basically take victory points opportunistically.

751
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:11,868
Rym: So you're trying to be like second place in victory points.

752
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:17,294
Rym: That way, if someone blitzes toward the end, you can either beat them on the blitz or kill them, but you're not so far behind.

753
00:43:17,314 --> 00:43:18,037
Rym: You can never catch up.

754
00:43:18,057 --> 00:43:21,814
Rym: Like if you roll two threes, go for that third three, get all those victory points.

755
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:32,533
Rym: But otherwise, go all energy, buy as many superpowers as you can and just be the invincible asshole who wins the game kind of on his own at the end when everyone else is kind of weak.

756
00:43:33,537 --> 00:43:35,344
Rym: I think that is the basic way to win.

757
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,332
Scott: And staying out of Tokyo means you can roll hearts.

758
00:43:37,372 --> 00:43:41,347
Scott: So if you do take damage, you can, you'll be good, right?

759
00:43:41,527 --> 00:43:47,368
Rym: But basically it's a light game, quick to play, quick to teach, could be reboxed into basically a tiny bag.

760
00:43:47,388 --> 00:43:47,649
Rym: Yeah.

761
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,859
Scott: And anyone can learn and play this game, right?

762
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:57,888
Scott: So it's, it's sort of like you can get people who are less gamery to play a game that does have some good strategies in it, right?

763
00:43:57,908 --> 00:43:59,775
Scott: That they normally might be averse to playing.

764
00:44:00,236 --> 00:44:01,240
Scott: The theme is excellent.

765
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:01,862
Scott: Awesome.

766
00:44:01,902 --> 00:44:02,966
Scott: The art is great.

767
00:44:03,046 --> 00:44:05,155
Rym: The pieces are super high quality, right?

768
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,346
Scott: There's a, there's a monster for every personal taste.

769
00:44:07,406 --> 00:44:09,759
Scott: Like I like all the monsters except King Kong because he's lame.

770
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:13,214
Rym: I think the Kraken and the evil bunny are my Kraken.

771
00:44:13,956 --> 00:44:14,497
Rym: It's a crack.

772
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:15,279
Rym: It's a Titan.

773
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,226
Rym: Have you never been mellow?

774
00:44:18,286 --> 00:44:18,647
Scott: Of course.

775
00:44:18,707 --> 00:44:19,249
Scott: I think I pay.

776
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:23,568
Scott: at first when I saw the cover of the box, you know, cause usually in rampage, I always pick Lizzie.

777
00:44:23,588 --> 00:44:28,167
Scott: So I was thinking I'd either be the Godzilla or I'd be the, uh, the cyber bunny.

778
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,352
Scott: Cause I mean cyber, right.

779
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,185
Scott: But then when I opened the box, I saw, Oh, there's a crack.

780
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:34,455
Scott: And that's basically just as good as the dinosaur.

781
00:44:34,535 --> 00:44:35,238
Rym: He's got a good face.

782
00:44:35,278 --> 00:44:35,920
Rym: The Godzilla.

783
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:36,382
Scott: Right.

784
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:38,370
Scott: And then I saw the Mecca dragon.

785
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,115
Scott: I'm like, wow, fuck.

786
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,845
Scott: I mean that's, you know, that's slightly edges.

787
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:44,579
Scott: The other ones out, but all of them are great except for the frigging King Kong.

788
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:50,076
Rym: Now I would compare this actually to skyline that game though.

789
00:44:50,097 --> 00:44:53,508
Rym: I wasn't it like part of the Kickstarter for a ground floor.

790
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:53,729
Scott: Yeah.

791
00:44:53,789 --> 00:44:55,237
Scott: It's much better than ground floor.

792
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,685
Rym: Well, ground floor is a shit game.

793
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:03,305
Rym: We talked about that, but skyline was kind of fun, but it's basically just a shorter Yahtzee.

794
00:45:03,405 --> 00:45:05,069
Rym: Skyline is to Yahtzee.

795
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,094
Rym: What Euchre is to wis.

796
00:45:08,337 --> 00:45:13,871
Rym: So between skyline and King of Tokyo, I think King of Tokyo is a better game.

797
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:18,009
Scott: I also agree because skyline didn't have as many of the interactive elements.

798
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:25,722
Scott: The only interactive elements, the only brings the ship it had was like the one piece left, you know, that extra piece you leave over in the storage or whatever.

799
00:45:25,743 --> 00:45:29,680
Scott: What's it called the leftover bits that someone else can grab all of.

800
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:29,881
Scott: Right.

801
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:29,981
Rym: Yeah.

802
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:30,423
Rym: That was it.

803
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:30,804
Scott: Yeah.

804
00:45:30,865 --> 00:45:31,186
Scott: That's it.

805
00:45:31,507 --> 00:45:35,824
Scott: Whereas this one, it's like you're directly Yahtzee and need to react to people.

806
00:45:35,884 --> 00:45:36,085
Scott: Right.

807
00:45:36,165 --> 00:45:43,957
Scott: If someone, you know, if you see it's like, you know, if it's depending on who's in Tokyo, you might reroll a claw, you know, not to hurt them.

808
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:44,379
Scott: Right.

809
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,586
Scott: Because they're going to lose anyway.

810
00:45:45,706 --> 00:45:47,334
Scott: You're better off getting some points or something.

811
00:45:47,716 --> 00:45:47,937
Scott: Right.

812
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:50,488
Scott: Let them stay in there and get killed by someone else.

813
00:45:50,649 --> 00:45:51,472
Scott: You know, is vicious.

814
00:45:51,894 --> 00:45:58,018
Rym: It adds a little bit more sort of randomness, but it's, it's the Yahtzee randomness that's heavily mitigatable by odds.

815
00:45:58,118 --> 00:46:07,209
Rym: You know, exactly the risk you're taking by going for X over Y over Z and the odds of six sided dice are trivial to calculate in your head.

816
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:08,394
Rym: You don't even need to calculate them.

817
00:46:08,414 --> 00:46:10,482
Rym: You just need to have the rough feel of them.

818
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:16,742
Rym: I mean, I played Yahtzee from my childhood, probably over a thousand times.

819
00:46:17,906 --> 00:46:19,371
Rym: Cause it was like, it's like the family game.

820
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:20,699
Rym: Like every family would play it.

821
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,831
Rym: I'd go over to friends' houses and they would all play it.

822
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:23,977
Rym: Like everyone played Yahtzee.

823
00:46:23,997 --> 00:46:25,847
Rym: We played in school and like elementary school.

824
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:29,723
Scott: Uh, I had a book of Yahtzee score sheets and they were empty.

825
00:46:29,744 --> 00:46:31,912
Scott: So I had a second book of Yahtzee score sheets.

826
00:46:31,973 --> 00:46:37,615
Scott: So that's how many, it's how many, one Yahtzee score sheet can play Yahtzee like fucking six times on both sides.

827
00:46:37,816 --> 00:46:43,334
Rym: We had a Yahtzee box from the fifties, like late fifties, maybe early sixties.

828
00:46:43,354 --> 00:46:49,441
Rym: Well, we had, we had a triple Yahtzee and the score sheets were all full of like my parents playing it when they were kids.

829
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:49,762
Scott: Yup.

830
00:46:50,124 --> 00:46:50,264
Scott: Yup.

831
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:52,835
Scott: I think that was the triple Yahtzee we had was my parents' one.

832
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:56,232
Scott: And then I think I had another one where I got the second set of score sheets.

833
00:46:56,252 --> 00:46:58,039
Scott: That was a travel Yahtzee.

834
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:02,898
Rym: When I learned about triple Yahtzee as a kid, I was like, well, it's obviously better than regular Yahtzee.

835
00:47:03,118 --> 00:47:08,336
Rym: So I made my own sheet and then I went to Kinko's and paid to have it duplicated.

836
00:47:08,356 --> 00:47:10,563
Rym: I was very proud of that.

837
00:47:10,884 --> 00:47:18,252
Rym: That same Kinko's refused to let me Xerox pages out of my dungeons and dragon cyclopedia because that would be copyright infringement.

838
00:47:19,315 --> 00:47:28,450
Rym: That was in the early days when copy machines and Kinko's were not exactly common and no one really knew, like people were afraid of Kinko's for copyright stuff.

839
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:40,413
Rym: And Kinko's really weird about that, but yeah, this is a, this is the kind of game that if you go to conventions or are commonly introducing games to other people like, Hey, would you like to play a game?

840
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:42,662
Rym: or Hey, you've come over to my party.

841
00:47:42,984 --> 00:47:45,353
Rym: Let's play a light game while we wait for people to show up.

842
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:46,919
Rym: This is your game.

843
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:47,641
Rym: Just buy it.

844
00:47:48,304 --> 00:47:49,328
Rym: It's also a great game.

845
00:47:49,388 --> 00:47:57,177
Rym: If you want to introduce games like this to your kids, a kid who is too young for Yahtzee, even though I think six year olds can play Yahtzee just fine.

846
00:47:57,538 --> 00:48:01,214
Scott: If you can count and you can, if you can play poker, you can play Yahtzee.

847
00:48:01,255 --> 00:48:01,376
Scott: Right.

848
00:48:01,396 --> 00:48:08,381
Rym: And I was like, my grandpa taught me poker and I was like, young kids who might not be interested in Yahtzee will play this because you're a monster.

849
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:16,143
Rym: You're got some after references to old robot movies and old monster movies.

850
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:18,513
Rym: And it's just very well done for what it is.

851
00:48:18,614 --> 00:48:19,820
Rym: And it's not that expensive.

852
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,921
Rym: A lot of times games that are of this caliber cost way more than this for no good reason.

853
00:48:25,223 --> 00:48:25,363
Scott: Yeah.

854
00:48:25,383 --> 00:48:30,245
Scott: What I think it really is, is just that, you know, there are these certain games that are like the warmup game, right?

855
00:48:30,346 --> 00:48:34,242
Scott: And you think of it as like a spotted or something along those lines, right?

856
00:48:34,403 --> 00:48:36,873
Scott: But those games I think are almost too light, right?

857
00:48:36,893 --> 00:48:40,750
Scott: They don't really, you know, get you sitting at a table to play a board game.

858
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:43,686
Scott: They don't really get you doing any sort of strategies or anything.

859
00:48:43,746 --> 00:48:43,927
Scott: Right.

860
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:46,921
Scott: And they get, because they're so light, they get too much play.

861
00:48:47,082 --> 00:48:48,589
Scott: I think those are better for the standup.

862
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,879
Scott: You know, we really don't have time for a game.

863
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:52,245
Scott: Let's play spot it.

864
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:52,506
Scott: Right.

865
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:56,042
Scott: I think this is really a real warmup game, right?

866
00:48:56,082 --> 00:49:10,459
Scott: You still get the people sitting at the table, you know, playing the game properly, and then you can switch to a real game once they're sitting there like that as it's much harder to switch into a Puerto Rico from a spot it than it is switch from a king of Tokyo to a Puerto Rico.

867
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:10,720
Rym: Yup.

868
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:16,566
Rym: And it's so quick to teach that you can get the people who normally wouldn't play a game to just, Oh, I'll play it.

869
00:49:16,827 --> 00:49:18,655
Rym: You'll be done with the whole game in 20 minutes.

870
00:49:19,016 --> 00:49:20,722
Rym: Plus five minutes of teaching tops.

871
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:21,746
Scott: Yeah.

872
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:22,810
Scott: And nerds like the themes.

873
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,261
Scott: You can get nerds to play is even if they're not board game people.

874
00:49:25,502 --> 00:49:25,703
Scott: Yup.

875
00:49:25,824 --> 00:49:26,105
Scott: You know?

876
00:49:26,889 --> 00:49:30,902
Rym: So, but seriously, if you want to be good at games, you haven't played Yahtzee.

877
00:49:31,545 --> 00:49:32,588
Rym: play Yahtzee.

878
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:34,917
Rym: You don't even need to play it with other people.

879
00:49:35,178 --> 00:49:36,663
Rym: Just play it by yourself.

880
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:38,450
Scott: I played some solo Yahtzees.

881
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,413
Rym: I played many a solo Yahtzee.

882
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:48,849
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

883
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:52,502
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and brand.

884
00:49:52,543 --> 00:49:52,844
Rym: Okay.

885
00:49:52,904 --> 00:49:53,728
Rym: For the logos.

886
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:58,988
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

887
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,881
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

888
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:06,663
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

892
