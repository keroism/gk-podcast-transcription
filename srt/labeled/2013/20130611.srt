1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,969
Rym: It's Tuesday, June 11th, 2013.

2
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:10,210
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:13,178
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,603
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,683 --> 00:00:19,275
Rym: Tonight, the E3 news, the console news, gaming news.

6
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:20,920
Rym: Lots of news.

7
00:00:23,383 --> 00:00:24,398
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,110
Scott: This morning was way weird.

9
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:30,970
Rym: Really?

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:31,336
Scott: Yeah.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,031
Scott: How?

12
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:38,970
Rym: I mean, I got up, was tired because I stayed up late, and I just biked to work and work was normal.

13
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:42,708
Scott: I woke up at like two or three.

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:43,552
Rym: What?

15
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:44,117
Rym: Like

16
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:44,600
Rym: a.m.?

17
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:48,455
Scott: Not p.m Yeah, a.m I don't know why.

18
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:50,660
Scott: I went to bed at like 10, like normal.

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,670
Scott: For some reason, I woke up way early, and I didn't really go back to bed that much.

20
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:56,541
Rym: Uh-huh.

21
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,397
Scott: It was very strange because that doesn't usually happen.

22
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:03,670
Scott: I mean, sometimes there'll be stretches where I'm waking up like an hour early, like six.

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,305
Rym: Did something wake you up?

24
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,230
Scott: Not unless.

25
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,589
Rym: Like when Brian and Family Guy wakes himself up with a fart?

26
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:12,528
Scott: Not unless that thing is nothing.

27
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,010
Rym: All right.

28
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,569
Scott: And I felt refreshed, so.

29
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,445
Rym: You just didn't go back to bed?

30
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:19,789
Rym: You just.

31
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,670
Scott: I just sort of laid in bed a lot and played some mobile games.

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,730
Rym: You know, a lot of people we know have experienced insomnia.

33
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:31,540
Scott: Yeah, but for them, that's a consistent problem.

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,210
Scott: For me, this is like once in ever.

35
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:38,110
Scott: So that's why it's strange, right?

36
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,089
Rym: So you just stayed up until eventually work?

37
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,337
Scott: No, I sort of got up early, and then I took a shower early.

38
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:45,761
Scott: I'd eat breakfast early.

39
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:50,070
Scott: I computed, and then I walked around outside.

40
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:50,553
Scott: Ah.

41
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,449
Scott: And then I went to work.

42
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:54,070
Rym: That's weird.

43
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,249
Rym: At least you had a nice walk outside.

44
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,850
Scott: Took some pictures of the neighborhood in the early morning.

45
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,616
Rym: I think you're getting old.

46
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:03,929
Rym: Those are the kind of things that old men do.

47
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,569
Rym: They wake up super early, and they putter around.

48
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,967
Scott: Maybe I just turned into an old man.

49
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:08,150
Scott: Suddenly.

50
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:08,990
Rym: I think that was the moment.

51
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,651
Scott: Yesterday I was 31, and today, 90.

52
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:18,179
Rym: So yeah, the only thing I really got going on is jury duty.

53
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,670
Rym: I completed it by, again, not being selected to serve on a jury.

54
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,269
Scott: Did you make it to voir dire?

55
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:27,410
Rym: I made it to stand outside of the courtroom for voir dire to begin.

56
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,069
Scott: Oh, I never made it that far.

57
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:38,169
Rym: And then the judge basically was like, "Yeah, we pretty much just called the jury, so you'd be standing out here to force these two schmucks to actually just come to a

58
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:38,430
Rym: settlement.".

59
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:45,509
Rym: And it worked, because once we were standing out there, I guess inside the judge was like, "Look, I'm gonna call that jury in here right the fuck

60
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:45,730
Rym: now.".

61
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,070
Scott: But you were at the Kew Gardens one, right?

62
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:47,666
Rym: No.

63
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:52,390
Rym: I ended up having to go to the state supreme court and civil court way out in Jamaica.

64
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:53,430
Rym: Oh, okay.

65
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,290
Rym: Let me tell you, Jamaica, there is nothing to eat.

66
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:58,623
Scott: Nope.

67
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,389
Rym: There are three awful looking fried chicken places.

68
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:03,172
Scott: Yep.

69
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:03,555
Scott: Kennedy.

70
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:05,370
Scott: I saw Lincoln Fried Chicken.

71
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,561
Rym: No, there wasn't even Kennedy.

72
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:07,490
Rym: It was all these super-off friends.

73
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,030
Scott: I actually saw Lincoln Fried Chicken.

74
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:09,666
Rym: Wow.

75
00:03:10,312 --> 00:03:10,400
Scott: Yeah.

76
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:18,210
Rym: And there were a couple of really crappy diners, a couple of restaurants where I walked in and nobody spoke English and there was no menu.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,269
Scott: Awesome.

78
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,990
Rym: There was just a sort of buffet of- A washing machine full of money?

79
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:33,970
Rym: There was like a generic buffet of really kind of sad looking food, but no really obvious way I could see to pay for it.

80
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:34,914
Rym: Never mind.

81
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:36,810
Rym: There was no cash register that I could see.

82
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,401
Scott: I'm sure it wasn't expensive.

83
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:39,810
Scott: Maybe it was a soup kitchen?

84
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:45,270
Rym: And that would have been the most boring day of my life, except I read all of Player of Games.

85
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:45,897
Rym: That's good.

86
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:46,669
Scott: That helps us out.

87
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:50,070
Scott: Did they make you watch that video about doing jury?

88
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,453
Rym: So they turned it on, right?

89
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:59,128
Rym: And before they turned it on, the woman stood up front and she said, "You all have to give this your full wink and total wink

90
00:03:59,409 --> 00:03:59,830
Rym: attention.".

91
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:05,709
Rym: And she turns it on and then after like a minute, this judge who was there walks out of the room and she stands up and just mutes it.

92
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:09,038
Rym: And it just played for the next like 20 minutes.

93
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,130
Rym: It was like these peasants murdering a dude in the water.

94
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,628
Scott: I saw that exact same video.

95
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:20,130
Scott: Now the thing with that video, right, is one thing it says in that video because they didn't mute it for us, right?

96
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,196
Rym: It had closed captions.

97
00:04:21,236 --> 00:04:22,082
Rym: I could have watched it.

98
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:23,070
Rym: I watched up until.

99
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,850
Scott: There was one thing in that video that was relevant to your story about standing outside the courtroom for the settlement.

100
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:34,087
Scott: In the video it says, "The people in the court feel the pressure of you sitting in this

101
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:34,307
Scott: room.".

102
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:36,073
Scott: Right?

103
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:46,347
Scott: It's like just by sitting here, the people in the court, the lawyers, the defendants, the plaintiffs, the judges, they know that you're waiting in this room to come in and juror, right?

104
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,169
Rym: Yeah, to basically cast judgment.

105
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:55,690
Scott: Yeah, and because of that, even if you don't go in and do anything, right, that has an effect.

106
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,682
Scott: And you saw that effect even worse.

107
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,370
Scott: In fact, the judge was wielding it.

108
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,636
Rym: And the bailiff was pretty cool.

109
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:02,702
Rym: He was like, "Well, you know what?

110
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:03,748
Rym: I guess this

111
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:04,150
Rym: counts.".

112
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,670
Rym: And he gave us all the form that says we never have to do jury duty again.

113
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,234
Scott: Mine counted.

114
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:09,390
Scott: I didn't even make it out of the room with the TVs.

115
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:11,709
Rym: They only went for one day?

116
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,248
Scott: They said, "Anyone who's left in this room, come up to the

117
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:14,510
Scott: front."

118
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,270
Scott: And they gave us all the piece of paper and we went home.

119
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:18,130
Rym: I got to leave early, basically.

120
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,270
Scott: We also did early, as soon as they had all of our dears taken out.

121
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,473
Rym: But this video was great.

122
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:28,607
Rym: There's this one moment where basically they're like, "In the old days, justice was

123
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:29,430
Rym: bullshit.".

124
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,230
Rym: That's right.

125
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,049
Scott: There's like murdering people.

126
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,008
Rym: And they do it like, "If he floats, he is guilty, but if he sinks, he is

127
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:38,450
Rym: innocent.".

128
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:44,645
Scott: And in the modern days, justice is still bullshit, but we're going to act like.

129
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:46,509
Scott: it's not because you're in the court right now.

130
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,430
Scott: But at least it's not that bullshit.

131
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,650
Rym: Whatever actor it was who played, I guess, the magistrate of that town, because they throw the guy in the water.

132
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,990
Scott: I'm sure we can find that video on YouTube.

133
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,714
Rym: I'm going to.

134
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:56,358
Rym: I'm going to add it.

135
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:58,270
Rym: I'm just going to link to it because it's pretty great.

136
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,190
Rym: But basically, they throw the guy in the water and everyone's all super serious.

137
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:04,248
Rym: And then the guy doesn't come back up.

138
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,749
Scott: Because he's a witch.

139
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:10,108
Rym: The magistrate just looks and then makes this kind of offhand gesture like, "All right, I guess he's

140
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:10,410
Rym: innocent.".

141
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,490
Rym: And then everyone celebrates.

142
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,147
Rym: Maybe we should go back to that.

143
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,730
Scott: They should just take that video and put the Monty Python thing in there and be better.

144
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:22,110
Rym: If that video is on YouTube, I'm going to mash it up with something.

145
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,064
Scott: All right, since our whole show is news, let's not do news.

146
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:24,830
Scott: You got any other openings?

147
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,032
Rym: Not really.

148
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:28,586
Rym: I've been playing Mario Tennis on the 3DS.

149
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:30,648
Rym: It's a new Mario.

150
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:32,669
Scott: I got a very tiny one.

151
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,490
Rym: It's not as good as at the end of 64 Mario Tennis.

152
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,830
Scott: We'll talk about that later.

153
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,907
Scott: I bought on Amazon the sequel to the Nine Doors, Nine Persons, Nine Hours, Nine Whatevers for the 3DS.

154
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:49,490
Scott: And I thought I'd save some money buying a used copy for 10 bucks less.

155
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:49,777
Rym: Uh-oh.

156
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:52,409
Scott: I opened up the package at work today.

157
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:53,389
Rym: Game wasn't in there?

158
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:55,089
Scott: No, they gave me a PS Vita copy.

159
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:55,807
Scott: What?

160
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,606
Scott: So I went and I immediately returned it.

161
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:01,142
Scott: I went on Amazon and I was like, "Give me a return slip.

162
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:03,109
Scott: Print, tape, go to UPS

163
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:03,370
Scott: store.".

164
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:03,890
Scott: Immediately.

165
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:06,809
Scott: So take that.

166
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,730
Scott: But I guess I have to buy a new copy to guarantee that I get a DS one.

167
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,110
Rym: We could buy another used copy.

168
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:14,107
Scott: I'll get another PS Vita one.

169
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:15,907
Scott: Whatever.

170
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,560
Rym: So anyway, things of the day.

171
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:24,879
Rym: I thought this was just cute.

172
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:29,960
Rym: It's a video about Magikarp and his trials and tribulations trying to find an owner.

173
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:31,600
Scott: I choose you, Magikarp.

174
00:07:31,782 --> 00:07:33,580
Rym: Use your splash attack.

175
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:42,320
Rym: It's that kind of video that's well done and makes the same joke consistently from beginning to end in increasingly absurd situations.

176
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,580
Rym: It's adorable.

177
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,940
Rym: And it's Magikarp.

178
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,898
Scott: You should also link, you know, I choose you.

179
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:47,711
Scott: Ditto.

180
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:48,396
Rym: Oh, shit.

181
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:50,759
Rym: I'm sure I could find that.

182
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:51,457
Scott: I love that one.

183
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,100
Scott: Anyway, so check this out.

184
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,838
Scott: There's a city in Spain, España.

185
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:57,640
Scott: I guess it's near Madrid.

186
00:07:57,925 --> 00:07:58,740
Scott: It's called Brunete.

187
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:01,079
Scott: And in Brunete, they had a problem.

188
00:08:01,662 --> 00:08:06,080
Scott: The people, they know scuba to poopa, even though I use an Italian accent in Spain.

189
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,017
Scott: Right.

190
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,240
Scott: They don't scoop the poop in this city.

191
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,860
Scott: This nice old city in Spain.

192
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,420
Rym: I think New York also has that problem.

193
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,939
Scott: This place had it much worse.

194
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,097
Scott: No, New York has it.

195
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:16,579
Scott: Right.

196
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,060
Scott: So what they did is they first tried to, uh, they made a remote control poop car.

197
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:23,640
Scott: Right.

198
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,160
Scott: They had a flag in it that said, you know, hey, scoop poop asshole.

199
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,779
Scott: Right.

200
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:30,720
Rym: It looks like they'd actually drive it into your foot.

201
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,250
Rym: If you didn't pick up the, that didn't really work.

202
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:34,339
Scott: Right.

203
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,780
Scott: So what they did is they, they, you know, we're doing clever with their marketing to get people to scoop the poop from the dogs.

204
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,934
Scott: And what they did is whenever anyone let their dog poop without scooping, they would go and scoop it.

205
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:47,718
Scott: Right.

206
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:51,180
Scott: And they would talk to the person and say, Hey, that is a nice dog.

207
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:51,959
Scott: What does your dog?

208
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,517
Scott: He's a name.

209
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,120
Rym: My dog's the name is Mario.

210
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:57,120
Scott: He's Italian dog living in a Spain.

211
00:08:57,981 --> 00:08:59,260
Scott: I'm Italian living here.

212
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,659
Scott: That's why I do not scoop the poop.

213
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,979
Rym: He's a German shot.

214
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,697
Rym: I had a point.

215
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:03,340
Scott: Right.

216
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,520
Scott: So then, but just based on the name of the dog, they knew a town the person lived in.

217
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:09,020
Scott: Right.

218
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:15,239
Scott: And the breed of the dog, they could look up in the dog license database and figure out who the fuck it was that didn't scoop the poop.

219
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:20,545
Scott: So they took the poop and they put it in a box and they would hand deliver it to that person's house.

220
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:23,140
Scott: lost property as lost and found.

221
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:24,879
Scott: And they made them sign a thing.

222
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,520
Scott: And inside the lost and found with the poop was a notice like, Hey, if you do this again, big fine, hundreds of dollars.

223
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,538
Rym: That is the kind of thing.

224
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:36,720
Scott: Poop scooping was decreased by like think 70%.

225
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,820
Scott: They say that's the kind of thing.

226
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,318
Rym: I mean, increase that just because of the way America is, we can never do stuff like that, but that's the kind of stuff you need to do.

227
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:45,452
Scott: Yup.

228
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,419
Scott: So funny video with the poop.

229
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:55,460
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club book is Ian M. Banks is player of games, which we will do on Thursday.

230
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:56,060
Scott: Yeah.

231
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,220
Scott: We finally read it at the jury duty.

232
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,196
Rym: Super good book.

233
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:03,080
Rym: Sadly, in a banks just recently actually did pass away.

234
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,020
Scott: I feel guilty because I chose the book right before we knew he was sick.

235
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,600
Scott: Then he got sick right after I chose it.

236
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,257
Scott: And then right before we do the episode, it's like, what the fuck?

237
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,779
Scott: More than one.

238
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,059
Scott: I feel like I shouldn't have chosen it.

239
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:29,489
Rym: More than one author of a GeekNights book club book was dead by the time we reviewed the book, but the timing, my psychic powers is the reason I'm so sad about it is partly that the book was awesome.

240
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:36,859
Rym: And now I already know that all the books he wrote are already out and there will never be any more.

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,479
Scott: There's one more.

242
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,056
Rym: And I wish I'd paid attention to him.

243
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:39,420
Scott: finished.

244
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,257
Scott: It's just not published a long time ago.

245
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:43,998
Scott: Oh, well, the books are still there.

246
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,080
Scott: The money will go to his family.

247
00:10:46,801 --> 00:11:03,140
Rym: So we have uploaded one of our five lectures from anime Boston, 2013 Joe anime by their cover night, which has a ton of likes and one dislike, I assume from some dude who likes tit anime and is mad at our valuation of tits in tit anime.

248
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:05,799
Rym: I can't imagine any other reason.

249
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:07,939
Scott: It could be just one of our haters are two haters.

250
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:08,540
Rym: It could be.

251
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:16,980
Rym: It's what's weird is the kinds of comments because we don't really upload anime lectures or shows just for logistical reasons.

252
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:23,060
Rym: Like we have a lot more sort of facilities and convention support from gaming cons like packs.

253
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:24,400
Rym: So we have a lot more video.

254
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,233
Scott: It only has like less than 200 views here.

255
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:27,328
Rym: Yeah.

256
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:28,620
Rym: Cause I just uploaded.

257
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,519
Rym: I'm not saying a lot of views.

258
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,760
Scott: What I'm saying is I could listen to you guys talk forever.

259
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,159
Rym: If you look at the comments of this anime video, it's basically people sucking our collective dicks.

260
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:38,739
Scott: Yeah.

261
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,239
Scott: But if you go to like, you guys make the best panels ever.

262
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:50,720
Rym: If you go to our entertaining panel, it's always people who are like, well, really don't you just drag and just that bad.

263
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,920
Rym: I don't know why you're being bad day, right?

264
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:56,479
Rym: It's a very different caliber of discussion.

265
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,478
Scott: Yeah.

266
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,139
Rym: Maybe we should just do more anime panels.

267
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:00,240
Rym: I don't know.

268
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,999
Rym: I think anime people are just easier to please.

269
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:03,032
Scott: I don't know.

270
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:05,159
Rym: And yeah.

271
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:06,739
Rym: Pax OS is coming up.

272
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,871
Rym: Connecticut is coming up.

273
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:22,239
Scott: Oh, uh, this Saturday, which is Saturday, June 15th thing is the New York city net runner regional tournament at the complete strategists.

274
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:25,460
Scott: If you want to participate, I don't know if there's open slots left.

275
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,277
Scott: There probably are.

276
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:30,340
Scott: You have to call the complete strategist and registrate, right?

277
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:33,680
Scott: You have to also know how to play net runner and have cards, right?

278
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,540
Scott: This is a tournament.

279
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,060
Scott: This isn't beginner's net runner.

280
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,326
Rym: My deck is 45 agendas.

281
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:42,339
Scott: No, is that legal?

282
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,879
Scott: No, there aren't enough agendas to do that.

283
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,552
Rym: I wonder, are there not enough with all the expansions?

284
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,060
Scott: because you can only use neutral.

285
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,079
Rym: You can't bring them from three of every neutral and then you've got to have all of your factions agenda.

286
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,856
Scott: It's not enough.

287
00:12:56,841 --> 00:13:01,838
Rym: All the rest of the cards are the weakest possible ice.

288
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,379
Scott: How are you going to raise them?

289
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:06,379
Rym: That's the point of the deck.

290
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,040
Scott: Anyway, uh, actually lots of week guys works pretty well, but anyway, uh, it's going to be pretty awesome.

291
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:14,939
Scott: It's going to be six rounds.

292
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:18,300
Scott: Usually we do three or four rounds, six rounds.

293
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:18,757
Scott: People.

294
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:19,532
Scott: This is going to lose.

295
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:20,442
Rym: This

296
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:35,463
Scott: is, this is effectively, I mean, I don't want to like toot New York's horn anymore than I already toot it, but from everything we can surmise, like, you know, how do you feel the story of the go master who, who's like the king of go, but he plays in the village and

297
00:13:35,824 --> 00:13:36,427
Rym: then he

298
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:38,937
Scott: goes to the capital and he gets his ass handed to him because

299
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:40,398
Rym: they have far surpassed him.

300
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:40,820
Scott: Right.

301
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,540
Scott: New York is the capital of net runner.

302
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,100
Scott: Like I'm really good at games.

303
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:48,840
Scott: I'm not the best here at net runner.

304
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:50,640
Scott: I'm like straight down the middle of the road.

305
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,559
Scott: The people here are super dangerous.

306
00:13:53,542 --> 00:14:01,797
Scott: I think that whichever people from New York go to the world, you know, championships, which I'm not going to because they're in like bumblefuck middle of the country at a bad time.

307
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:09,060
Scott: Uh, and I wouldn't go there even if it was a good time are probably going to win or come close to it because they're super dangerous.

308
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:17,154
Scott: So this regional is sort of like, you know, world championships, you know, guess one level under that.

309
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,639
Rym: Well, do you think, how do you think you're going to do?

310
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,620
Scott: I predict I will get 10 prestige points because that's what I always get.

311
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:26,120
Scott: But that's in four rounds.

312
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,496
Scott: I think with six rounds, right, I get an average of 10 prestige points for four rounds.

313
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:34,540
Scott: in six rounds.

314
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:37,873
Scott: I can get at least 14 or 16 prestige points.

315
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,541
Scott: It's hard to get an odd number 15.

316
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,340
Scott: So 14 or 16 points to win this tournament.

317
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,419
Scott: You're going to need to get a lot of sixes.

318
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:49,820
Scott: So the maximum score you can get is 36 prestige points.

319
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:53,653
Scott: I'm thinking the top people are going to have between like 32 and 36 points, right?

320
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,999
Scott: If you don't at least get to 30, you're not winning this thing.

321
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:04,080
Scott: But the top eight people get some sort of goody prize of swag.

322
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:13,520
Rym: That's how all those things seem to work, because a lot of people seem to only go to card based events at game stores or events in general at game stores and comic shops.

323
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:17,580
Scott: If there's swag of some kind, there are people I know who are in it for the swag.

324
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:25,200
Scott: I can't imagine being like that because basically NAC flight sells these game kit game night kits to stores.

325
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,919
Scott: You can't buy one unless you are a store.

326
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,700
Scott: But for example, one guy works at a store in Westchester.

327
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,300
Scott: He just bought one because he worked it right.

328
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:31,649
Scott: Yeah.

329
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:33,059
Scott: He bought the whole kit for himself.

330
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:43,016
Scott: But and then the store uses those things in that kit as game night prizes or tournament prizes or whatever they want to do, and it includes a regionals trophy.

331
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:44,720
Scott: that fantasy flight makes them and everything.

332
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:47,560
Scott: So, you know, they don't sell those on the shelf.

333
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:51,120
Scott: They give them away at an event and that's the only way to get them.

334
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,180
Scott: So people go to events just to win these things.

335
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:01,380
Scott: I know people who went to like New Jersey and Long Island to try to win tournaments to get more swag because there'll be less competition.

336
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:07,460
Rym: Granted, there's a PAX medal hanging in your apartment.

337
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,459
Scott: I didn't go in that tournament to get that medal.

338
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,260
Rym: Did you went into that tournament specifically to get that medal?

339
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:20,380
Rym: Because someone reminded you that it turns out if you play in the early Sunday morning tournaments, there aren't many people.

340
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:21,938
Rym: And you thought you could just snag a free medal.

341
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,360
Scott: Meanwhile, I ran the early Sunday morning tournaments at PAX East.

342
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,238
Scott: There was a ton of people.

343
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,040
Rym: I think PAX East gets more of the early morning people.

344
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:30,599
Rym: I don't know the tournament at PAX East.

345
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,403
Scott: It's so many people.

346
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:34,540
Rym: Anyway, the is actually really popular.

347
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,860
Scott: The thing is, in Netrunner, I'd actually want to win that trophy.

348
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:40,700
Scott: It's basically just a glass thing with like a laser etching on it.

349
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,000
Scott: This is like, you know, Netrunner championship, whatever.

350
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,282
Scott: Right.

351
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:44,780
Scott: You know, regionals champion.

352
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:46,124
Scott: I would want that.

353
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:52,251
Scott: I wouldn't want any of the other stuff like play mats, cards, you know, credit tokens.

354
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:53,500
Scott: I don't want any of that bullshit.

355
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,042
Scott: Right.

356
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:55,519
Scott: Or like there's like a Netrunner box.

357
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:56,973
Scott: You can put your cards in.

358
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:57,640
Scott: I want none of that.

359
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:06,319
Scott: All I want is the trophy because then I can gloat for like five minutes before people think you're going to like put that on a chain and wear it around your neck at PAX.

360
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,459
Scott: Listen, it's possible that every game I sit down like Maker's Eye seven points, I win.

361
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:12,999
Scott: And just every time it is possible, it could happen.

362
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,903
Scott: It could happen.

363
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:14,525
Scott: I could.

364
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:15,329
Scott: it could also act.

365
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:18,769
Scott: some nub could show up and they all they know is how to do that.

366
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:19,618
Scott: It could happen.

367
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,871
Scott: So I've never played before.

368
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:22,536
Scott: it could happen.

369
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,580
Rym: So Xbox, PlayStation, Wii U, what are you talking about?

370
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,500
Scott: So many E3 news is let's try to cover the biggest one.

371
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,200
Rym: We are not going to bother with the blow by blow, play by plays fact sheets.

372
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:46,280
Rym: If you want to know the individual announcements, there are a lot of people who actually cover that way better than we would ever even bother doing.

373
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,581
Rym: Yeah.

374
00:17:47,044 --> 00:17:50,159
Scott: Go read what we read on the Internet and you can know all the things.

375
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:51,547
Scott: we're going to commentate on the thing.

376
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:54,161
Scott: So let's commentate on the used game thing because that's the biggest.

377
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:58,720
Rym: So I am conflicted on the used game thing in a lot of ways.

378
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,121
Scott: All right.

379
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:06,339
Rym: On one hand, I feel that first sale rights are a crucial aspect of the modern economy and consumer world.

380
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:06,781
Rym: I agree.

381
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:11,423
Rym: I feel like that is a strong right that needs to be not just upheld, but extended by the courts.

382
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:11,724
Scott: Yes.

383
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:15,160
Scott: If I buy a thing, it is now my thing to then do with as I please.

384
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,580
Scott: Imagine people didn't have first sale rights for like a car.

385
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,405
Scott: So you bought a Ford.

386
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:20,540
Rym: You had to sell it back to the company shop.

387
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:20,902
Rym: Yeah.

388
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:24,853
Scott: It's like all you could do with it when you were done with it is, you know, whatever Ford let you do with it.

389
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:25,440
Scott: That's bullshit.

390
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:26,969
Scott: I'm not renting.

391
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:28,260
Scott: If I'm renting it, I understand.

392
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,507
Scott: But I'm not renting or leasing.

393
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,639
Rym: I am buying now at the same time.

394
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:38,500
Rym: First sale rights have been actually very recently upheld by even recent Supreme Court guy reselling his autocads.

395
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:45,458
Rym: Remember, he I think he won that court case selling textbooks that they bought overseas, then moved to the United States, also another win for us.

396
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:53,222
Rym: But at the same time, it has not been applied directly to all manner of things yet for a number of reasons.

397
00:18:53,825 --> 00:19:09,800
Rym: And it was difficult to apply to digital things because someone who has, say, let's go back to ancient technology, a CD, some music on it, if they rip it and then sell it, that basically also constitutes duplication and dilutes the market.

398
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:13,420
Rym: And it has secondary effects if you call it piracy.

399
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:19,582
Rym: And regardless of how you feel about that, it does have an effect on that industry with games.

400
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:24,182
Rym: A lot of people tried to call me a hypocrite because I'm so for this first sale rights.

401
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:28,120
Rym: But yeah, I'm so against DRM, but yet I keep buying games on steam.

402
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,300
Rym: My answer to you is that I buy games on steam for a dollar.

403
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,127
Rym: That's right.

404
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,259
Scott: See, here's the thing.

405
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:38,820
Scott: When you pay 50 bucks for a fucking game on a disk, right, you own that shit.

406
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:40,680
Scott: You paid 50 goddamn dollars.

407
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,140
Scott: I know there's contracts and legal agreements and you lose.

408
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:45,940
Scott: Forget all that bullshit for right now.

409
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,221
Scott: Right.

410
00:19:46,422 --> 00:19:49,980
Scott: If you pay 50 dollars for a fucking video game, you own that goddamn game.

411
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,540
Scott: It's yours to do with as you please.

412
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:51,900
Scott: Right.

413
00:19:52,342 --> 00:19:57,963
Scott: If I pay one dollar, I mean, technically, steam says, you know, I own it kind of.

414
00:19:58,044 --> 00:19:58,285
Scott: Right.

415
00:19:58,345 --> 00:20:01,140
Scott: But it's like you could call that a rental.

416
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:03,960
Rym: I can't 100 percent trust steam.

417
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,639
Rym: I like steam, but I don't 100 percent trust steam.

418
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:07,142
Scott: Right.

419
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:11,180
Scott: It's like for a dollar or for like a hand for almost no money, you know.

420
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:11,822
Scott: Yeah.

421
00:20:12,184 --> 00:20:12,506
Scott: OK.

422
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:24,759
Scott: I'm willing to accept that this is, you know, just like if I go to Blockbuster and I pay five bucks and they let me take home an NES cartridge like I did back in the day, I didn't feel like I owned it, even though I gave a person money and took a physical good from them.

423
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:28,260
Scott: I didn't feel like I owned it because I paid so little.

424
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:36,840
Rym: Now, I understand why a lot of people are really OK with this because they're looking at it from the perspective of a game gets sold for 50 bucks.

425
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,384
Rym: Someone sells it back to GameStop for like five bucks and then GameStop sells it again for 40 bucks.

426
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:45,280
Scott: So basically GameStop is is ripping people off.

427
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,319
Rym: GameStop is getting a ton of money from this churn, but none of that money goes to the original producers of the games.

428
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:55,816
Rym: Well, the same thing happened in the music industry before.

429
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:57,683
Rym: piracy was even cars.

430
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:02,360
Scott: If I sell my car for doesn't get shit, but cars wear out.

431
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:03,663
Scott: That's true.

432
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:06,820
Rym: Video games don't, but video games get old.

433
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,863
Scott: That's true.

434
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:10,680
Rym: So it's a complicated situation.

435
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,482
Rym: But what I would say is that every industry where this has come up has tried to wash it.

436
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:21,964
Rym: The media companies did not want Blockbuster Video and its ilk to exist at all.

437
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:25,060
Rym: They didn't want DVDs to even be able to be in libraries.

438
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,410
Scott: Use bookstores, people.

439
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:27,500
Scott: Just deal with it, right?

440
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:35,756
Scott: The thing is, used bookstores are not ripping used music stores at many junctures in the early days, but used bookstores aren't ripping you off the way.

441
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:39,660
Scott: GameStop is ripping you off just because GameStop, but is GameStop really ripping you off?

442
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,081
Rym: They're just charging what the market will bear and the market will easily bear that price.

443
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:43,322
Scott: Right.

444
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:47,140
Scott: But the thing is, what the market will bear is too damn high.

445
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:52,266
Scott: They pay you too little for the game when they buy it from you and they charge too much and they resell it.

446
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:54,720
Rym: But they're not charging too much because people gladly pay it.

447
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,845
Scott: You could just see.

448
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:59,623
Scott: the thing is more people need to sell their games directly to each other.

449
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,980
Scott: Amazon to get the full price.

450
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:06,279
Scott: If I, you know, GameStop is if I, let's say, have a copy of I see Mario.

451
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:07,225
Rym: You're right.

452
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:08,940
Rym: But here's why that doesn't happen.

453
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:13,360
Rym: The only people who sell games back to GameStop are like 14 years old.

454
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,224
Scott: Exactly.

455
00:22:14,364 --> 00:22:16,860
Rym: And can't use the Internet and Amazon to do this effect.

456
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,559
Scott: They could if their parents are fucking cool.

457
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,360
Rym: Well, yeah, I mean, I could have, but most kids can't.

458
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,305
Rym: I'm not going to pretend that there's a magic universe where parents are going to let their kids do that.

459
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:27,740
Rym: Not everyone had a credit card at 16.

460
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,720
Scott: You don't need a credit card to sell things.

461
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:33,440
Scott: And you just need a box and some tape and a printer.

462
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:36,419
Rym: I'm pretty sure you have to be a teen or an account.

463
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,083
Rym: Yeah.

464
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:38,800
Scott: But, you know, you log in your parents account.

465
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,380
Scott: You know, you say I'm selling this, you get whatever.

466
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:48,060
Scott: It's not hard, but it's definitely something a teen could do if they were smart enough enterprising and their parents were cooperative.

467
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:54,964
Rym: But what's interesting is that the majority of gamers don't even know this is an issue or care.

468
00:22:55,165 --> 00:23:01,200
Scott: No, they they're the most of these people, the same as the anime fans, you don't even know an anime con is a thing that exists.

469
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,662
Rym: They don't even realize that the Xbox and PlayStation four were actually 100 percent announced.

470
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:16,275
Scott: Like they don't realize they only get that news is that they'll only get their game news from like the mainstream media, like the door, maybe the really game magazine or go to a game store.

471
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,624
Rym: The impression they get it from hearsay and rumors from their slightly more connected friends.

472
00:23:21,786 --> 00:23:22,048
Scott: Yes.

473
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,200
Scott: Only Internet people.

474
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:27,544
Scott: And it seems like there's a lot of Internet people know Internet people is still the minority.

475
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:30,140
Rym: It's just you're on the Internet right now hanging out with Internet people.

476
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,420
Scott: Yes, you are Internet people.

477
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,539
Scott: Most of the world is not doesn't get us.

478
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,278
Scott: They're not connected to us.

479
00:23:36,702 --> 00:23:38,440
Scott: I know I meet a lot of people on the street.

480
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,039
Scott: They have no idea what the fuck's going on in the world the way we do.

481
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:42,438
Rym: Here's what really bothers me.

482
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:49,180
Rym: The whole argument for consoles, because consoles have a place and had a place, was that it's the thing that just works.

483
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,339
Rym: You bring it to grandma's house, you turn it on.

484
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:55,080
Rym: You put something in the thing and the game just works.

485
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,800
Scott: No, here's the reason the video game consoles.

486
00:23:58,262 --> 00:23:58,524
Scott: Right.

487
00:23:58,565 --> 00:24:00,120
Scott: We're super big back in the day.

488
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,840
Rym: Well, back in the day, there was no alternative.

489
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:02,549
Rym: Well, right.

490
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,217
Scott: Well, there was.

491
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:03,440
Scott: Right.

492
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,080
Scott: It's like, OK, you get any S or you can get a computer, but what's a computer?

493
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,240
Scott: It's an Apple to four thousands of dollars for just one hundred dollars.

494
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:13,818
Rym: You can get an NES and use more than one hundred bucks.

495
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,259
Scott: NES is one hundred bucks after like a year or two.

496
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,567
Rym: Yeah, after a year or two.

497
00:24:19,587 --> 00:24:21,500
Scott: And that was with a gun and with the cartridge.

498
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,160
Scott: Anyway, they were cheap, way cheaper than like an actual computer.

499
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:36,687
Scott: And also because they were only doing games, not doing anything else like at the time the NES was out, it could play games way better than the best computer that you could buy in your house.

500
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:38,320
Rym: The NES launch price was two hundred bucks.

501
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,479
Rym: OK, so that's two hundred and fifty with the bullshit.

502
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,543
Scott: How much in that?

503
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:46,880
Scott: what year was that of eighty four, eighty four, eighty five.

504
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:50,380
Scott: And how much did an Apple to cost in eighty four, eighty five?

505
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,831
Rym: I'm not saying your core point is wrong.

506
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:52,980
Rym: I'm saying what was better.

507
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,400
Rym: Mario Brothers, Oregon Trail, Oregon Trail is actually kind of a shit game.

508
00:24:58,561 --> 00:24:59,625
Scott: I didn't say it's a good game.

509
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,900
Scott: I'm talking like graphically audio wise, everything wise.

510
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:04,416
Rym: I think I implied all that.

511
00:25:04,598 --> 00:25:04,740
Scott: Yeah.

512
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,540
Scott: NES had superior software to far more expensive machines at the same time now.

513
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:15,480
Scott: And the thing is, right, those computers, they didn't do all the things that a modern computer does.

514
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,311
Scott: If you got an Apple to what were you going to do with it?

515
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,679
Scott: Play games and make games.

516
00:25:19,462 --> 00:25:19,684
Scott: Right.

517
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:21,019
Scott: That is what you're going to do with it.

518
00:25:21,382 --> 00:25:22,720
Scott: You couldn't really type up a paper.

519
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,851
Rym: Oh, you might break it.

520
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:24,580
Scott: Maybe.

521
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:26,399
Rym: Yeah, that was a lot of kids bought it to break.

522
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:26,942
Scott: Sure.

523
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:31,539
Scott: You know, even later when they were like black and white, like Mac plus and stuff, it's like, yeah, OK.

524
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,105
Scott: Carmen Sandiego on there.

525
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:40,920
Rym: Not as good as any of all these traditional arguments about the places and of consoles and in the world, everything aren't as relevant to the modern era.

526
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:45,742
Rym: And in the modern era, the primary use of a console is that you don't need to know shit about computers.

527
00:25:46,224 --> 00:25:49,860
Rym: You don't need to buy a gaming computer, which is more expensive than a console.

528
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:59,879
Rym: I mean, if I buy the new Nvidia 770 video card, that costs about as much as an Xbox one is going to cost just for the video card.

529
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,321
Scott: Yeah.

530
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:06,200
Scott: But the thing is, you supposedly you already have a PC because you need one to live these days.

531
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,960
Scott: It wasn't like in the 80s or the 90s where you didn't need a PC to live.

532
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,839
Scott: Right now, everyone's got one.

533
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:15,600
Rym: Well, no, everyone who's in the middle class and up has one.

534
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:23,726
Scott: Well, yeah, but you could, for example, now get some Macs which don't really play games or just live off iPads for your PC-ing.

535
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:29,880
Scott: if you're not really computery and you don't need to, you know, get Adobe tools or programming or anything serious.

536
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,542
Scott: Right.

537
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:32,800
Scott: And then get a video console for your video games.

538
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,020
Scott: You could do that and not have a PC at all.

539
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:45,680
Scott: But if you're going to have a PC and you're going to spend more than like a couple hundred dollars on it, right, buy a fucking gaming PC, kill two birds with one stone.

540
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:55,540
Rym: What I'm saying is that the consoles, the way they're going, especially with this resale thing, they're killing a lot of the big part of what does make consoles great compared to PCs for a lot of people.

541
00:26:56,161 --> 00:27:02,059
Rym: I'm going to remember right now all of the reasons I could see myself using a console instead of a PC.

542
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,219
Rym: One, it does just work.

543
00:27:06,484 --> 00:27:08,480
Scott: I never really have a problem with the PC not just working.

544
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,680
Rym: Yeah, well, this is where magic Uber race.

545
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,729
Scott: I open up steam.

546
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,780
Scott: I double click on a game.

547
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,284
Scott: It runs.

548
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:14,760
Rym: We're normal people.

549
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:16,019
Rym: It does just work.

550
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,864
Rym: Give it to grandma.

551
00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:19,718
Rym: As long as you help her plug in the HDMI cable, it will just work.

552
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:20,421
Scott: No.

553
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:28,940
Rym: Two, the games are physical things that you just keep track of and trade around your friends and sell and whatever, which now they're killing that.

554
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:29,322
Scott: Yeah.

555
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:32,220
Rym: Three doesn't need to be connected to the network.

556
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,731
Rym: So you bring it to grandma's house when your parents foist you on her or the vacation, the beach house.

557
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:37,979
Scott: Yeah.

558
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,920
Rym: Bring it into the beach for you.

559
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,920
Rym: Bring it to the convention and you play it in the room.

560
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,337
Rym: A lot of people will play video games in their hotel video game.

561
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,239
Scott: Hotel room is big.

562
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:49,862
Rym: Yeah.

563
00:27:49,942 --> 00:27:57,940
Rym: They're killing that with the twenty four hour check in and I have to pay for Internet to use my console in the hotel room at Otakon.

564
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:00,089
Rym: That's rough.

565
00:28:00,534 --> 00:28:00,979
Rym: It's real rough.

566
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:02,559
Rym: Even further beyond that.

567
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:05,550
Rym: So now the game, the video game room itself.

568
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,902
Rym: at a con, they don't wire the console gaming rooms up with Internet.

569
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:12,000
Rym: No, that'd be a giant pain in the ass and really expensive.

570
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,440
Scott: Well, conventions are a concern to a very small number of people.

571
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,059
Scott: It's just something we're very familiar with.

572
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:18,366
Rym: It's a big deal.

573
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:20,580
Scott: It is a big deal for a small number of people.

574
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,399
Rym: Yes, but there will be ramifications of that.

575
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:31,469
Rym: A lot of small gaming cons will not be able to have Xbox ones with working games on them at the convention.

576
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:31,979
Scott: That is true.

577
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,780
Rym: That's not going to bode well for the Xbox one.

578
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,180
Scott: I don't think conventions are going to be a big seller for Xboxes, nor were they ever.

579
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:55,080
Rym: No, but what it means is that part of the culture around the console that allows, for example, the fighting game community in one particular game to keep itself going long multiple years into that console's lifespan is because they play in tournaments at conventions.

580
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,542
Rym: That's true.

581
00:28:55,582 --> 00:29:10,979
Scott: If you go to a local fighting game tournament, the kind that doesn't have all arcade machines or stuff like that, they're going to be using PS fours for the foreseeable future for those tournaments and not Xbox one simply because it'll be a pain in the ass to set up the Xbox ones for those sorts of things.

582
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:20,220
Rym: Yeah, but believe me, it is not easy to get Internet set up at these convention centers, let alone in all your little console gaming rooms if you've got more than one.

583
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:29,020
Scott: And because of that, I wouldn't be surprised if already a lot of the fighting game community is all across different systems, wherever their games are.

584
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,063
Scott: That's where they go.

585
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:43,922
Scott: I could see all sorts of competitive game communities, you know, people who are going to want to use the same system as they're going to be competing on in a local tournament are going to be not using Xboxes because the local tournaments won't be using Xboxes because they can't.

586
00:29:44,143 --> 00:29:49,160
Scott: And that is a little bit larger than the convention community, but still a small percentage.

587
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:50,138
Rym: Also, the library.

588
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,142
Rym: A lot of the ways the libraries of these small conventions work is people donate their old discs.

589
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,280
Rym: That's not going to work anymore.

590
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,720
Scott: Also, here's the more significant the local library.

591
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,580
Scott: The real libraries often check out games to people.

592
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:04,242
Scott: Right.

593
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:11,089
Scott: I can go to the local library and like get some Xbox games if I want, but not Xbox one games.

594
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:12,580
Scott: No, no.

595
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,883
Scott: Now, imagine if.

596
00:30:13,984 --> 00:30:19,420
Scott: imagine if there were like books like published by a certain publisher and they didn't have them at the library.

597
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,240
Scott: You could only get them at Amazon.

598
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:25,140
Scott: You couldn't get them at Barnes and Noble and like you couldn't give and lend them to people.

599
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,820
Scott: And they were just like Kindle books only.

600
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:37,358
Rym: So meanwhile, Sony won a big press coup by announcing that they're not going to have that kind of D.R.A That was definitely like a slide they added in.

601
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,020
Rym: And the Internet was ecstatic about that.

602
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,699
Rym: But that's not actually what they said.

603
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:50,558
Scott: They said, well, the thing is, right, is if you watch the video of their presentation, right, that is what they said.

604
00:30:51,264 --> 00:30:53,680
Scott: Very clearly and loudly while smiling.

605
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,439
Rym: Yeah, because what they said is technically true.

606
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:04,382
Rym: But there's a follow up interview here with Tretton and he says, and I quote, we create the platform.

607
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:12,160
Rym: We've certainly stated that our first party games, we're not going to be doing that in regards to restricting used game sales.

608
00:31:12,782 --> 00:31:16,140
Rym: But we welcome publishers and their business models to our platforms.

609
00:31:16,984 --> 00:31:18,239
Rym: There's going to be free to play.

610
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:21,340
Rym: There's going to be every potential business model on there.

611
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:28,340
Rym: And again, that's up to their relationship with the consumer and what they think is going to put them in the best stead.

612
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:30,240
Rym: So we're not going to dictate that.

613
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,699
Rym: We're going to give them a platform to publish on and to translate that all the third party people can do whatever the fuck they want.

614
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,261
Scott: Yep.

615
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:38,260
Scott: Which is good and bad, right?

616
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,080
Scott: If you're a developer, you want to be able to do whatever the fuck you want.

617
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:47,560
Rym: And also a gamer, average gamer out there, gamer dude name first party Sony games.

618
00:31:48,745 --> 00:31:49,414
Scott: Little big planet.

619
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:49,819
Rym: Yeah.

620
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:52,178
Rym: Name another one gamer out there.

621
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:53,807
Scott: Not Metal Gear.

622
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,540
Scott: That's Konami, right?

623
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:02,011
Scott: Also, they said the same thing about DRS PlayStation All Stars, which is the Smash Brothers of PlayStation on DRM.

624
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,360
Rym: The DRM decision is going to have to be in the hands of the third parties.

625
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:10,920
Rym: That's not something you're going to dictate, mandate or control or implement.

626
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,560
Scott: Well, that is sort of nice in one way.

627
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:19,198
Scott: And I was saying developers can now do what they want on the PlayStation that they're less restricted, sort of, you know, it's not P.C.

628
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,105
Scott: unrestricted.

629
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:20,468
Scott: Right.

630
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:21,620
Scott: We can do whatever the fuck you want.

631
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:27,484
Scott: But it seems like there's going to be less limitations for developers because Nintendo is the polar opposite.

632
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:27,645
Scott: Right.

633
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:36,460
Scott: Where you have to do the what the fuck Nintendo says, you know, if you want to put a game out on their system, whereas Sony is going to be like they're even letting indies self-publish on PlayStation four.

634
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,145
Scott: Like, go for it.

635
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:38,900
Scott: Bring the games to the PlayStation.

636
00:32:39,461 --> 00:32:45,459
Rym: But I guess the moral is that everyone who's saying, oh, I'll be able to sell my used games and there'll be no DRM in the PlayStation four.

637
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:48,920
Rym: That's not probably actually true.

638
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:57,224
Scott: I wonder how if you wanted to, let's say EA, evil EA wanted to make a no use sale game for the PS4.

639
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:02,556
Scott: How would they do it without the with if there's nothing in the PlayStation four platform to support that?

640
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,054
Rym: Technological.

641
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:07,489
Rym: Yeah, we don't know.

642
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,297
Scott: They would have to.

643
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:09,049
Rym: But they went out.

644
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:13,949
Rym: I mean, this interview went out of his way to say basically they can do it if they want to.

645
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:26,649
Scott: I think the only thing they could really do is when you open up the game from the disk, you know, you have to log into your EA account or something and then, you know, the disable that disk, it won't work again.

646
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,530
Scott: I don't think they could disable the disk because all the disks would be identical.

647
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:29,992
Scott: Right.

648
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:37,450
Scott: They would have to just basically you would have to pay and have an account and your account would have to have that game rumblings like on Xbox.

649
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,530
Rym: The disks won't actually be identical.

650
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,744
Rym: There's a way to identify disk.

651
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:42,750
Scott: Whoa, crazy.

652
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,480
Rym: I don't know if that's if that's legit or not, but I read that and it's from a semi legitimate source.

653
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,330
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

654
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:48,752
Scott: All right.

655
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,470
Scott: So the used thing has been beaten to death.

656
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:51,949
Scott: Let's move on to the other things.

657
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,312
Scott: Yeah.

658
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:53,230
Rym: Backward compatibility.

659
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:54,434
Scott: No one.

660
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:55,589
Scott: No one's doing any of it.

661
00:33:55,972 --> 00:33:56,479
Rym: Yeah.

662
00:33:56,782 --> 00:33:57,370
Rym: No one ever does.

663
00:33:57,691 --> 00:34:00,050
Rym: It's funny because people have such short memories.

664
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:07,809
Rym: A lot of people on the Internet were like, well, we shouldn't really expect backward compatibility, but Nintendo actually has been doing a good job with that.

665
00:34:08,492 --> 00:34:14,810
Scott: Yeah, remember the original DS, the DS fat could play GBA, right, and DS games.

666
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:16,889
Scott: The 3DS can still play DS games.

667
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:25,969
Scott: The Game Boy SP could play Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color and original gray cartridge Game Boy games.

668
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,273
Scott: All right.

669
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:31,511
Scott: The Game Cube had a thing that you could put under it to play GBA games on it.

670
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:35,050
Scott: The Super Nintendo had the Super Game Boy.

671
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:36,708
Scott: You could play Game Boy games on that.

672
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:38,489
Rym: And there's older precedent.

673
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:43,350
Rym: The Atari seventy eight hundred could play any Atari twenty six hundred game.

674
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:44,094
Scott: Yeah.

675
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:46,469
Scott: Only fifty eight hundred couldn't was incompatible.

676
00:34:47,112 --> 00:34:47,922
Rym: It's not the fifty eight.

677
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:48,570
Scott: fifty two hundred.

678
00:34:48,992 --> 00:34:49,295
Scott: Yeah.

679
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:50,929
Scott: The five one.

680
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:52,190
Scott: That was the one that couldn't play.

681
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,138
Rym: And nobody owned.

682
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:54,369
Scott: I had a friend who owned it.

683
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:55,155
Rym: I know everyone.

684
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:58,055
Rym: Everyone had a friend who owned it, just like everyone knew some kid who had an EOG.

685
00:34:58,156 --> 00:34:59,890
Scott: I had twenty six hundred fifty two hundred.

686
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:07,890
Rym: I always wanted a fifty two hundred because then that little book of all the different games, the fifty two hundred had all the cool, weird games with keyboards and shit.

687
00:35:08,011 --> 00:35:08,373
Scott: It did.

688
00:35:08,393 --> 00:35:11,753
Scott: But you could just get like an Atari eight hundred Excel if you want to do that shit.

689
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:12,016
Scott: Yeah.

690
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:13,230
Rym: But that wasn't in my stars.

691
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,128
Rym: My first computer was a forty six six two.

692
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:15,571
Rym: Yeah.

693
00:35:15,772 --> 00:35:20,870
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, backwards compatibility is a thing that's existed.

694
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,171
Scott: Right.

695
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:26,714
Scott: And I've noticed the pattern is pretty much is the thing, you know, Nintendo to Super Nintendo.

696
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:30,190
Scott: Nobody really complained about not having backwards compatibility.

697
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:30,733
Scott: Why?

698
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:33,250
Scott: Number one, the cartridges are completely different.

699
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:34,930
Scott: It was sort of a common sense thing.

700
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,250
Scott: Like, of course, Super Nintendo can't play NES games.

701
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,295
Scott: They don't fit.

702
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:41,705
Rym: I mean, the Genesis and the Master System and all the other systems didn't do it well either.

703
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:41,990
Rym: Right.

704
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:48,064
Scott: And it's also on top of that, there were only those the second system ever effectively for a lot of people.

705
00:35:48,288 --> 00:35:48,430
Scott: Right.

706
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,750
Scott: For most people, the Atari twenty seven hundred didn't even exist.

707
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,730
Scott: It was NES was the first video game, maybe second.

708
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,126
Scott: It will bring Atari into it.

709
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:55,410
Scott: Right.

710
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,170
Scott: And SNES was the second.

711
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:01,409
Scott: So people didn't see this future of boxes piling up under the TV.

712
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:05,509
Rym: Now, also there I mean, back then, what other devices did you have hooked up to a TV?

713
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:11,570
Rym: You had your VC fucking arm and a cable box, maybe if you had if you had cable.

714
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,092
Scott: Yeah.

715
00:36:12,313 --> 00:36:12,534
Scott: Right.

716
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:17,395
Rym: Or you might have had that little box that lets you rotate the antenna on your room.

717
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,649
Scott: There was no plague of boxes under the TV.

718
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:20,654
Rym: I had one of those boxes.

719
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:22,550
Rym: I could physically rotate the antenna on my right.

720
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:31,290
Scott: But basically the precedent up to this point was if the cartridges are the same as the seventy eight hundred and twenty six hundred were, they all work.

721
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,554
Rym: And so I was wrong.

722
00:36:32,594 --> 00:36:39,609
Rym: The the Sega Genesis had backward can full backward compatibility with what the master system.

723
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:42,430
Scott: I did not know you could put Master System games in a Genesis.

724
00:36:43,052 --> 00:36:44,849
Scott: Didn't you need some sort of adapter thing to do that?

725
00:36:46,932 --> 00:36:48,850
Rym: I'm reading right now, say release the power.

726
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:50,550
Rym: There's a big article, so keep going.

727
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:52,904
Rym: I was I was a smart kid, so I didn't tend to.

728
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:53,850
Rym: I got to read this article.

729
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,290
Scott: Now, I didn't know you could play Master System games in agenda.

730
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,279
Rym: Anyway, continue your thought.

731
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,390
Rym: I'm going to figure out what the deal is.

732
00:36:59,031 --> 00:36:59,834
Scott: So and notice.

733
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:00,055
Scott: Right.

734
00:37:00,075 --> 00:37:04,354
Scott: So what happened is that was the last system that had the same exact cartridge.

735
00:37:04,374 --> 00:37:07,810
Scott: They kept having different cartridges until the CD was invented.

736
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:08,712
Scott: Right.

737
00:37:09,033 --> 00:37:14,233
Scott: And as soon as the CD was invented, backwards compatibility and made an immediate comeback.

738
00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:18,910
Scott: The PlayStation one and the PlayStation two both had CDs or DVDs.

739
00:37:19,474 --> 00:37:19,718
Scott: Right.

740
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:20,489
Scott: And guess what?

741
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,110
Scott: PS2 backwards compatible.

742
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:28,552
Scott: As soon as the media format stop changing, backwards compatibility immediately reappeared.

743
00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:35,889
Scott: The expectation is if it has the same physical media, it should fucking run the games from the previous system.

744
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:40,709
Scott: And this and also around that time, a weird as adapter that I told you.

745
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,532
Scott: Yeah.

746
00:37:41,572 --> 00:37:41,873
Scott: Yeah.

747
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:47,513
Scott: By that when the PS2 came out, that is when the plague of too many boxes under.

748
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:49,750
Scott: the TV was just getting started.

749
00:37:50,132 --> 00:37:50,453
Scott: Right.

750
00:37:50,755 --> 00:37:54,170
Scott: And the PS2 actually saved you because that was when the PS2 came out.

751
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,490
Scott: Most people didn't have DVD players.

752
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:55,730
Scott: Yeah.

753
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:04,390
Rym: You realize the only reason we had a brand new when we lived in an apartment at RIT is because I found for Scott Johnson's DVD player.

754
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,770
Rym: Well, we took his for a while, but then I got for ninety dollars.

755
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:12,030
Rym: I bought a stand piece of shit, super bootleg piece of shit.

756
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,929
Rym: We had to take the case off because it would overheat.

757
00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:14,372
Rym: Yeah.

758
00:38:14,674 --> 00:38:17,470
Rym: And we had flashed its bios to make it region free.

759
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:17,892
Rym: Yep.

760
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:20,729
Rym: Even though we never once watched a region disc on it.

761
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,270
Scott: Well, you know, some of those ones from video bar may or may not have been.

762
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,039
Scott: Yeah, we don't know.

763
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,688
Rym: It's hard to say.

764
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:27,690
Rym: We had no way to know anyway.

765
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:33,555
Rym: The there's another factor here that I think is actually a big deal when it comes to the backward compatibility.

766
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:36,292
Scott: Well, I want to say the Dreamcast is not back as compatible with the Saturn.

767
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:40,506
Scott: So that doesn't entirely hold right.

768
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,649
Rym: in the old days.

769
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:48,251
Rym: You it was typical in a lot of middle class households to have many TVs around the house.

770
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:52,331
Scott: Well, even today, people who have houses and families have TVs around the house.

771
00:38:52,411 --> 00:38:56,829
Scott: I have noticed having visited living room, kitchen, every bedroom has a TV.

772
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:09,030
Rym: So I've noticed just from visiting people's houses, especially like, you know, years ago going to co-workers houses for dinners and whatever there, I think there are fewer televisions than there used to be.

773
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,769
Rym: A lot of people now have the big flat screen TV in the living room.

774
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:20,669
Rym: They have the previous older TV in one other room and the bedroom TV is slowly being replaced by iPads.

775
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,035
Scott: That could be true.

776
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:25,090
Scott: But even my parents house where there's only two people living.

777
00:39:25,652 --> 00:39:25,873
Scott: Right.

778
00:39:26,094 --> 00:39:29,030
Scott: There's still a TV in like every fucking bedroom and in the kitchen.

779
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:29,511
Rym: Yeah.

780
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:32,269
Rym: But I think I feel like I don't know if the kitchen TV is still there.

781
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,610
Rym: Younger parents do not have as many TVs as older parents.

782
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,230
Scott: That could be very well the case.

783
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:39,917
Scott: It's also interesting to see.

784
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,850
Scott: maybe the Wii U is sort of realizing that.

785
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:49,910
Scott: And that's why they're like, hey, if someone's using the TV, you play on the Wii U. But that's more of a Japanese thing, right?

786
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,650
Scott: You think a Japanese house definitely only has like one or two TV.

787
00:39:52,690 --> 00:40:03,715
Rym: Now, what I would also see is that a lot of people in the old days, like in the 80s, 90s, not only would they have a TV in every room, but they'd have a one game console plugged into each TV.

788
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:06,970
Rym: The newest console was on the newest TV in the living room.

789
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:10,229
Rym: And then like the Atari was in the basement hooked up to the old TV.

790
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:14,793
Rym: And the Nintendo was in like the little brother's room and the Super Nintendo was in the older brother.

791
00:40:14,814 --> 00:40:17,530
Scott: A lot of people's houses I went to who had more money than we did.

792
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:17,831
Scott: Right.

793
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:24,010
Scott: It's like, yeah, the main home theater TV, the big one that had no console, no consoles, just VCRs and stuff.

794
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:30,977
Scott: And then the kids had like the busted had the second best TV was in the basement with all the kids shit.

795
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:33,810
Scott: And it had all the consoles on it with switches.

796
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:38,654
Scott: Or maybe they had the best console was there and some other console was like in the kids bedroom.

797
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:41,450
Rym: Yeah, it was another TV for a long time.

798
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,829
Rym: My brother and I, I kept the NES, he had the SNES.

799
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:46,590
Rym: And if we wanted to play one, we just had to go to the other kids room.

800
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:52,063
Scott: But I do see I think a lot of also bedroom TVs, like for teens, are replaced with bedroom computer.

801
00:40:52,245 --> 00:40:52,609
Scott: Exactly.

802
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,480
Rym: Or just or just tablet.

803
00:40:54,681 --> 00:40:56,010
Rym: They don't even have a computer.

804
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,888
Scott: But the point is, you have a you have a screen is just not a television screen.

805
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:00,572
Scott: that's in your room.

806
00:41:00,914 --> 00:41:12,891
Rym: So all this means that backward compatibility would be much more useful to the average person, especially because they want to resell the old console and not keep all their consoles forever and have a pile of boxes under the TV.

807
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:17,097
Rym: People would do in the old days when they only own two or three, but they have a game that they bought.

808
00:41:17,117 --> 00:41:18,770
Scott: They want to be able to play that game forever.

809
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,412
Scott: Right.

810
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:24,468
Scott: And people like us know that in like five to 10 years, we'll just be able to emulate that game on our PCs.

811
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:29,639
Scott: But most people still don't even have to emulate fucking NES games and they buy virtual console games.

812
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,349
Scott: They don't know better.

813
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:37,010
Rym: Dude, when I was in middle school, there was a kid whose family was rich at a laptop, like a four eighty six laptop.

814
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:37,473
Rym: Yeah.

815
00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:40,069
Rym: And he had an NES emulator on it.

816
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:40,818
Scott: There you go.

817
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:41,587
Scott: There you go.

818
00:41:42,653 --> 00:41:44,149
Scott: But yeah, people who don't know how to do that.

819
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:44,697
Scott: Right.

820
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:45,510
Scott: They have a game.

821
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,870
Scott: They want to be able to play that game.

822
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,529
Scott: If they don't have backwards compatibility, they effectively lose that game.

823
00:41:51,750 --> 00:42:05,809
Rym: When they buy a new console, unless they have a pile of boxes under their TV, which also because kids the longer memory of the Internet and the fact that people use apps on their computers, they expect things to stick around forever once they pay for them.

824
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,485
Rym: I mean, steam does that.

825
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:08,736
Rym: Steam is just up.

826
00:42:08,857 --> 00:42:10,230
Rym: Those are all my games forever.

827
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,050
Rym: It doesn't matter what changes on my computer.

828
00:42:12,472 --> 00:42:16,493
Scott: I can go and find the first game I ever got on steam, which is Half Life one and play it today.

829
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:17,018
Scott: And it works.

830
00:42:17,443 --> 00:42:18,090
Rym: But it's all moot.

831
00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:25,769
Rym: I'm going to argue that having or not having backward compatibility in the modern era has zero effect on sales.

832
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,392
Scott: I agree.

833
00:42:26,714 --> 00:42:29,270
Rym: Zero, not even point one percent zero.

834
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:29,851
Scott: I agree.

835
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:34,934
Rym: Nobody will not buy a console because it's not backward compatible with the previous version.

836
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:40,310
Scott: They might have other reasons for not buying and that might be one of them, but that's not going to be the straw that breaks any camel's backs.

837
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,310
Rym: So there's this article here about Nintendo's stuff.

838
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,369
Rym: It's a Totillo and the headline says everything.

839
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,950
Rym: Nintendo's new games are fun, but they're playing it ridiculously safe.

840
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,590
Rym: That is the truest true bog standard Nintendo.

841
00:42:54,191 --> 00:42:57,490
Rym: So I was not impressed with a link between worlds.

842
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,155
Scott: Yeah, that was the one.

843
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:07,210
Scott: that was one of the reasons that I was going to get a 3DS because and I did get a 3DS because I said I also have a 3DS now sequel to link to the past.

844
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:09,049
Scott: And I'm like, well, fuck, yeah, I got to have that.

845
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:16,229
Scott: And apparently I look at it and it's like, hey, this looks like a not really a sequel, but mostly just a slightly remixed link to the past.

846
00:43:16,411 --> 00:43:18,530
Scott: You sort of fooled me there, asshole.

847
00:43:19,091 --> 00:43:22,330
Scott: I was expecting an all new game in the same world with the same mechanics.

848
00:43:22,972 --> 00:43:28,110
Scott: And this is looking like mostly the same game with a few things changed here and there.

849
00:43:28,771 --> 00:43:30,270
Scott: I can play that game anytime I want.

850
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,169
Scott: I don't need to buy a new copy of it.

851
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:37,290
Rym: I have a much more direct complaint and I swear this isn't just nostalgia.

852
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:41,650
Rym: I think this kind of 3D graphic looks like butt.

853
00:43:42,313 --> 00:43:43,690
Rym: I think it looks terrible.

854
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:44,211
Scott: I agree.

855
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:47,790
Scott: The graphic looks like butt, but I don't buy or not buy games based on graphics.

856
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:56,789
Rym: But it also just looks kind of fiddly like you don't have as much control because it's not obvious where things overlap like it was in the old 16 bit era for a game like this.

857
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,110
Scott: I agree with that as well.

858
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,630
Rym: Just don't look that precise.

859
00:44:00,092 --> 00:44:00,574
Scott: I agree.

860
00:44:00,795 --> 00:44:04,070
Scott: It looks more like what was that one for the DS?

861
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:06,010
Rym: Oh, I feel very vindicated.

862
00:44:06,532 --> 00:44:09,729
Rym: The top several comments are about how ugly the game is.

863
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:13,150
Scott: OK, I mean, I'm not saying it's not ugly.

864
00:44:13,331 --> 00:44:21,830
Scott: It is, but that's not what's going to make me buy or not buy the game if it was actually a true sequel to Link to the Past and it played like a Zelda game.

865
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,149
Scott: That's all I need.

866
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,170
Scott: You can make it look like all the butt you want.

867
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,531
Scott: Right.

868
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:29,070
Scott: Remember when Wind Waker came out, everyone complained and now only stupid people.

869
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,549
Scott: And now everyone's like Zomgy Wind Waker.

870
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:39,089
Rym: Thing is, people, the people who complained about that style, I hated them because they were complaining about the wrong thing for the wrong reason.

871
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:42,160
Rym: OK, they was.

872
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:44,330
Scott: the point is look at Nintendo's lineup, right?

873
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:53,030
Scott: And they again, as we all have been complaining on GeekNights since GeekNights has existed since 05, they are not taking advantage of their hardware.

874
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:57,190
Scott: Their software is not fulfilling the potential that they could be making.

875
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,770
Scott: Of course, there's no Pokemon MMO.

876
00:44:59,372 --> 00:44:59,674
Scott: Right.

877
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:01,750
Rym: But wait, they're making Wii party.

878
00:45:02,811 --> 00:45:03,214
Scott: What?

879
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,029
Scott: Next, what else they got?

880
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:08,550
Rym: Eighty brand new party game.

881
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,730
Scott: I mean, there are some games in there that I kind of want to play.

882
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:14,985
Scott: For example, they got the Smash Brothers coming for the Wii U and the 3DS.

883
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:16,534
Scott: Good move.

884
00:45:16,957 --> 00:45:19,363
Scott: But that means now I don't have to buy a Wii U. I can just play it on 3DS.

885
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,403
Rym: Now, I have a big worry about it being on the 3DS.

886
00:45:22,826 --> 00:45:23,610
Rym: kind of an aside.

887
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,009
Scott: My worry is going to be the hit in every packs.

888
00:45:26,751 --> 00:45:36,370
Rym: My worry is that it's actually not going to be as good and complex as the previous Smash Brothers and they're going to slightly dumb it down.

889
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,889
Scott: Well, here's the thing, right?

890
00:45:38,191 --> 00:45:45,310
Scott: If the pro Smash Brothers people already complain that was it Melee or which one was second, Melee or Brawl?

891
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:46,308
Rym: Brawl is the newest one.

892
00:45:46,731 --> 00:45:50,873
Scott: So, so they basically say Melee was the real deal and Brawl basically already dumbed it down.

893
00:45:50,894 --> 00:45:51,468
Rym: too much for them.

894
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,970
Rym: I can see their points.

895
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,340
Scott: Right.

896
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,269
Scott: So, you know.

897
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:59,570
Rym: And having played the new Mario, even on the console, you're already.

898
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:00,291
Scott: Yeah.

899
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:03,470
Rym: The thing is, Brawl was OK for me because I'm not hardcore about it.

900
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:06,069
Rym: I also like Melee and I like playing both of them.

901
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:07,350
Scott: I like playing the original.

902
00:46:08,114 --> 00:46:09,309
Rym: I never really liked the original.

903
00:46:09,956 --> 00:46:10,808
Scott: Same fucking game.

904
00:46:11,857 --> 00:46:12,462
Rym: I didn't like it.

905
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,169
Rym: I never liked it.

906
00:46:13,514 --> 00:46:14,067
Scott: All of them are good.

907
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:14,614
Scott: Yeah.

908
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:15,488
Rym: Yeah.

909
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:27,670
Rym: But having played the Mario Tennis, it just doesn't feel too slow and too sort of dumbed down and easy and timing doesn't matter anymore.

910
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:30,230
Scott: Nintendo's making all their games easier.

911
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,130
Scott: That's what they've been doing ever since Mario Kart Super Circuit.

912
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:38,051
Rym: Mario Kart is still not doing much interesting with this separate console, with a separate screen.

913
00:46:38,072 --> 00:46:47,772
Rym: They're doing this kind of basic, lame stuff like, oh, you can keep playing the game when you go take a poop because you only have one TV, but they're not doing the kind of crazy.

914
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:52,127
Rym: I still think Crystal Chronicles did more with this stuff than almost any game they're releasing.

915
00:46:52,391 --> 00:46:52,875
Scott: Yeah.

916
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:54,390
Scott: You know, I was hanging with the Netrunner people.

917
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:54,915
Scott: Right.

918
00:46:55,137 --> 00:46:56,369
Scott: And we were talking about it.

919
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:56,711
Scott: Yeah.

920
00:46:57,013 --> 00:46:58,962
Scott: And all of those people also.

921
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:00,550
Scott: Crystal Chronicles four swords.

922
00:47:01,394 --> 00:47:01,939
Rym: Oh, my God.

923
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:03,049
Rym: We should just play four swords.

924
00:47:03,351 --> 00:47:03,591
Scott: Yeah.

925
00:47:03,772 --> 00:47:12,468
Rym: Right now, we were all together in our club of having GameCube GBA hookups and really Deus Ex on the Wii U.

926
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:15,250
Scott: We already played that on PC a long time ago.

927
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:19,650
Rym: Now, I can see it working on the Wii U, but they didn't.

928
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:23,570
Rym: They showed like they zoom in on the person holding the handheld thing.

929
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:28,670
Rym: And oh, my God, he's got his inventory down there instead of on a separate screen.

930
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:29,509
Scott: Oh, my God.

931
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:31,229
Scott: Welcome to the GameCube era.

932
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:37,129
Rym: Maybe, maybe they'll do something cool where you do the hacking game there while your guy's just still on the screen.

933
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,425
Scott: But getting shot at.

934
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:39,292
Rym: Yeah.

935
00:47:39,312 --> 00:47:40,689
Rym: Which happens in the real game.

936
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:41,273
Scott: OK.

937
00:47:41,454 --> 00:47:43,590
Rym: You try to hack and someone comes around the corner, you're fucked.

938
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,010
Rym: You just start taking damage.

939
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:45,974
Scott: All right.

940
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:48,550
Scott: Yeah.

941
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:49,515
Scott: Any other games in there?

942
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:51,870
Scott: I think the new Yoshi's Island, which is kind of interesting.

943
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:56,290
Scott: And Yoshi's Island is really good, but I actually never even beat the first Yoshi's Island for Super Nintendo.

944
00:47:56,391 --> 00:47:57,708
Scott: So I got to start working on that.

945
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:58,930
Rym: This new Mario Kart.

946
00:47:59,670 --> 00:47:59,772
Scott: Yeah.

947
00:47:59,813 --> 00:48:00,590
Scott: Mario Kart eight.

948
00:48:00,731 --> 00:48:02,269
Scott: See, I actually was wrong on this.

949
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:18,311
Scott: I thought that, you know, there was strong evidence to suggest that Nintendo considered the 3DS to be the primary platform and the Wii U to be secondary because, for example, right on the on the 3DS, they had new Super Mario Brothers, new Super Mario Brothers, too.

950
00:48:18,411 --> 00:48:23,232
Scott: And on the Wii, they had new Super Mario Brothers, you or Wii U. Right.

951
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:25,404
Scott: And it's usually, you know, Mario Kart DS.

952
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:27,111
Scott: Right.

953
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:29,448
Scott: You'll call Mario Kart and they have Mario Kart DS.

954
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:35,810
Scott: And when you put the name of the system in the title of the game, you're sort of implying this isn't the mainline version.

955
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,090
Scott: This is sort of the side version.

956
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:38,431
Scott: Right.

957
00:48:38,773 --> 00:48:43,894
Scott: So when you call Mario new Mario Brothers, the 3DS one, you don't put 3DS in the title.

958
00:48:44,176 --> 00:48:45,810
Scott: You're implying that that's the main one.

959
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:51,373
Scott: And the one on the Wii U that has Wii U in the title is sort of a second track, you know, the second tier.

960
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:57,145
Scott: But Mario Kart sevens on the 3DS and Mario Kart eight is on the Wii U. So what the fuck does that tell you?

961
00:48:58,452 --> 00:49:00,589
Rym: Tells me I won't be playing Mario Kart eight anytime soon.

962
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:06,810
Scott: Well, yeah, but I mean, I think it means that Nintendo doesn't really consider either platform to be primary or secondary.

963
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,130
Rym: Maybe we're Gandalf Gerthing and they're just inconsistent in their naming.

964
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:12,570
Scott: Now, I don't think they have any logic behind their naming, really.

965
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:17,730
Rym: Yeah, but there's nothing particularly interesting or innovative from Nintendo.

966
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,290
Rym: It's all kind of just hardcore ports.

967
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:25,050
Rym: Like, look, we've got big boy games, too, coupled with their basic smash hits.

968
00:49:25,231 --> 00:49:25,452
Scott: Yep.

969
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:29,430
Scott: The remakes I'm not interested in because I can play the originals, right?

970
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:33,570
Scott: Most of the baby games and interested in the third party games are all crap.

971
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:38,008
Scott: There's just a few Nintendo exclusives that I want and pretty much all of them are on 3DS.

972
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:41,682
Scott: And there isn't even one for Wii U that I can think of.

973
00:49:42,204 --> 00:49:43,770
Scott: that I need to get a Wii U for.

974
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,049
Scott: You know, it's like they got that Wind Waker HD.

975
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:46,937
Scott: That's a remake.

976
00:49:47,058 --> 00:49:47,563
Scott: Don't need it.

977
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:48,330
Scott: I have Wind Waker.

978
00:49:48,472 --> 00:49:49,549
Scott: I could play it anytime I want.

979
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:49,851
Rym: Yep.

980
00:49:50,273 --> 00:49:52,970
Scott: So, I mean, they added some new stuff, but whatever.

981
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:53,602
Scott: I don't give a shit.

982
00:49:54,170 --> 00:50:04,250
Scott: So the Xbox price, I just want to say, I just want to say you can get a badass gaming PC for $800 that can play pretty much everything on Steam.

983
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:16,770
Rym: So I just want to say to all you kids out there, because I said it was going to cost $500 a long time ago, and I was ridiculed by certain listeners.

984
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:21,030
Rym: You told me that I'm old and out of touch and I don't know anything about the market.

985
00:50:21,373 --> 00:50:21,857
Rym: And you know what?

986
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:23,369
Rym: You can all eat a big old dick.

987
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:24,316
Scott: Bag of dicks.

988
00:50:25,243 --> 00:50:25,989
Scott: EABOD.

989
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:32,470
Rym: You know, I, while EABOD, the original use was eat a bag of dicks, I like big old dick because it implies...

990
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:33,870
Scott: I like bag of dicks.

991
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:34,529
Scott: That is mine.

992
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:38,610
Scott: Imagine a bag, like a bag of holding with just dicks coming out of it all over the place.

993
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:44,150
Rym: But what about a guy, just a big old dick, eat a big old dick, like eat a big old crow.

994
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,500
Scott: No, eat a bag of dicks.

995
00:50:46,247 --> 00:50:46,570
Scott: It's better.

996
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,781
Rym: Regardless, I was right.

997
00:50:47,882 --> 00:50:48,550
Rym: You guys are stupid.

998
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:52,110
Scott: Yeah, and the PlayStation 4 is going to be $400.

999
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:58,049
Scott: But I assume that extra $100 is the $100 you're not spending on all that TV tuner.

1000
00:50:58,451 --> 00:51:00,790
Scott: You know, it's not a cable box like the Xbox.

1001
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:06,455
Rym: Well, adjusted for inflation, the Atari 5200 cost $680.

1002
00:51:06,455 --> 00:51:06,950
Rym: That's true.

1003
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,071
Rym: In 2006.

1004
00:51:09,071 --> 00:51:10,930
Scott: How about that $200 NES in modern dollars?

1005
00:51:13,823 --> 00:51:14,050
Scott: Wow.

1006
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:14,805
Scott: The 3DO.

1007
00:51:15,171 --> 00:51:17,464
Scott: So all the inflation happened between the $7800 and the NES.

1008
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,600
Rym: Remember the 3DO?

1009
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,310
Rym: $700.

1010
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:21,424
Scott: Yep.

1011
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:23,589
Rym: Interesting.

1012
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:25,041
Scott: Yeah.

1013
00:51:25,892 --> 00:51:26,065
Rym: Oh, well.

1014
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:26,809
Rym: Yeah, well.

1015
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:29,470
Rym: Neo Geo, almost $1000.

1016
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:31,628
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm going to say the same thing I say every time...

1017
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:35,370
Rym: Oh no, 3DO adjusted $967.

1018
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:35,550
Scott: Oh, okay.

1019
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:38,630
Scott: I'm going to say the same thing I say every time new consoles comes out, right?

1020
00:51:39,091 --> 00:51:41,230
Scott: Pretty much the reason you buy a console is for the games.

1021
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:44,529
Scott: We're already assuming you're not a PC gamer, you're not going to play games on a PC.

1022
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,610
Scott: Maybe you just have iPads and Macs, right?

1023
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,249
Scott: So you're going to buy a console to play games on.

1024
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:52,150
Scott: Most of the games are on both consoles, right?

1025
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:54,290
Scott: But those are still games you want.

1026
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,370
Scott: So you need one of the two consoles to play those games.

1027
00:51:57,591 --> 00:52:04,130
Rym: And even if you are a PC gamer, you might want to play the game, the console games online with your gaming people.

1028
00:52:04,633 --> 00:52:10,270
Rym: If you're super gamer, I could see someone owning both, especially if like your friends playing Steam while you're on the Xbox.

1029
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,050
Scott: Right.

1030
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:14,650
Scott: Like if you, you know, we still don't have cross platform online play.

1031
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:24,030
Scott: So if your friends are playing a game online and they they're all PS3 people, PS4 people, you need a PS4 to play online with them because they're not using Steam, right?

1032
00:52:24,631 --> 00:52:28,909
Scott: Anyway, so, you know, you're going to choose one of these things to play the games on.

1033
00:52:29,011 --> 00:52:31,250
Scott: So what is the difference really between these two things?

1034
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:41,929
Scott: Well, I guess if you don't have an HDBC and you don't want one, the Xbox is probably going to give you all that stuff you don't have and maybe not mean you don't have to have a cable box, which is kind of good.

1035
00:52:42,151 --> 00:52:47,770
Rym: But you've got to have Internet in your living room and all the restrictions we've talked about.

1036
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:48,072
Rym: Yeah.

1037
00:52:48,133 --> 00:52:50,070
Scott: If you're willing to deal with that, you're willing to deal with it.

1038
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:51,415
Scott: Right.

1039
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:56,303
Scott: To, you know, maybe you don't want to put up with that annoying Internet bullshit.

1040
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:56,910
Scott: Right.

1041
00:52:57,231 --> 00:53:00,070
Scott: And the PlayStation exclusive games are the ones you want.

1042
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:03,170
Scott: As I go with that, it doesn't really matter.

1043
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,093
Scott: Right.

1044
00:53:04,173 --> 00:53:05,119
Scott: It's whichever one has.

1045
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:06,850
Scott: if you want Halo, get Xbox.

1046
00:53:07,152 --> 00:53:09,367
Scott: If you want some JRPGs, get a PS4.

1047
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:15,449
Scott: And just if you want and all the games that are not exclusive, get them for whichever one you pick.

1048
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:18,288
Rym: If you want Nintendo games, get a Wii U, get a 3DS.

1049
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:19,394
Scott: I'll get a 3DS.

1050
00:53:19,455 --> 00:53:21,310
Scott: No games on a Wii U that you want to use.

1051
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:25,029
Scott: Second, there's not one game for Wii U that I saw that I need.

1052
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,229
Rym: Yeah, that is not.

1053
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:29,408
Rym: I don't know if there'll ever be a time I need a Wii U, but I didn't.

1054
00:53:30,313 --> 00:53:30,554
Scott: Yeah.

1055
00:53:30,594 --> 00:53:33,168
Scott: Name one Wii U game that you got to have.

1056
00:53:33,591 --> 00:53:34,909
Rym: Now, someday there might be one.

1057
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:37,229
Scott: Maybe one is not enough.

1058
00:53:37,571 --> 00:53:47,810
Rym: So I have a posit, an idea as to why Microsoft is making the Xbox check in every 24 hours and have online.

1059
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,509
Scott: Well, there's a lot of reasons we can guess.

1060
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:56,070
Rym: Yeah, I don't think the Internet part of it has anything to do with DRM or piracy.

1061
00:53:56,350 --> 00:54:05,650
Scott: I think it doesn't either, because if they they already basically have as much DRM as they can have on a console, if someone's going to hack the console, they'll just make it play offline.

1062
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:09,570
Scott: So that doesn't protect them from mod chips or anything of the sort.

1063
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:11,730
Rym: It is to be able to drive advertising.

1064
00:54:12,131 --> 00:54:15,410
Scott: Of course, they already do drive advertising, but this will make it better.

1065
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:19,609
Rym: It makes sure everyone with one is getting the advertising driven to them.

1066
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:20,474
Scott: Absolutely.

1067
00:54:20,514 --> 00:54:27,729
Rym: So it'll force you to at least get some Xbox silver account for free or whatever, and then they'll keep pressuring you to get the more expensive one.

1068
00:54:28,971 --> 00:54:37,490
Rym: It'll let them integrate all of their sort of achievement social stuff to to pressure you into buying the games your friends are playing.

1069
00:54:37,851 --> 00:54:44,310
Scott: They'll also track everything you do on there, including your TV, watching habits and everything you do, any part of the console.

1070
00:54:44,431 --> 00:54:51,469
Scott: And they'll make sure that that data gets sent to them by giving you a strong incentive of your games won't fucking work unless you send us our tracking data.

1071
00:54:53,611 --> 00:55:04,930
Rym: And I think they're going to really have a lot more free to play microtransaction games that need that, because otherwise not to be able to pay the real money to get the microtransaction bullshit.

1072
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:05,332
Scott: Yeah.

1073
00:55:05,352 --> 00:55:10,490
Scott: If you don't have Internet connection, basically free to play is not possible on that platform, right?

1074
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:15,070
Scott: Therefore, they want to make sure that a free to play game is possible for everyone.

1075
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:22,550
Scott: Otherwise, what might happen if someone goes to the store and buys a game that's a free to play game or picks up a free copy of it, right?

1076
00:55:23,114 --> 00:55:24,270
Scott: And brings it home to play.

1077
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:25,559
Scott: And they didn't have Internet on.

1078
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:32,176
Scott: their Xbox is like, you know, there hasn't been a game on a disk that is said Internet required to play.

1079
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:33,669
Scott: I don't think there's been one.

1080
00:55:34,071 --> 00:55:42,289
Rym: Well, if we go all the way back again to the PC game cube, when you would buy a not not fantasy star that was older.

1081
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,290
Scott: No, it was a fan.

1082
00:55:44,451 --> 00:55:45,550
Scott: It was a fantasy star online.

1083
00:55:45,772 --> 00:55:46,890
Scott: I don't know if it was on GameCube.

1084
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:52,149
Scott: I think there was a GameCube MMO that was a fantasy star online, too.

1085
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,048
Scott: It might have been fantasy star online, too.

1086
00:55:55,631 --> 00:55:56,988
Rym: You ever played a fantasy star game?

1087
00:55:59,112 --> 00:56:00,077
Rym: No, no.

1088
00:56:00,138 --> 00:56:02,189
Rym: windows, PlayStation, Vita, iOS.

1089
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:08,730
Scott: What was the GameCube GameCube MMO fantasy star online?

1090
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:09,193
Rym: Oh, yeah.

1091
00:56:09,274 --> 00:56:11,130
Rym: Regular PSO was on the GameCube.

1092
00:56:11,592 --> 00:56:12,642
Scott: OK, yeah, there you go.

1093
00:56:12,662 --> 00:56:13,188
Rym: OK, there we go.

1094
00:56:13,591 --> 00:56:15,110
Scott: So I guess you needed Internet for that to work.

1095
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:15,773
Scott: I remember Scott Johnson.

1096
00:56:15,793 --> 00:56:16,377
Rym: Well, there was that.

1097
00:56:16,397 --> 00:56:18,490
Rym: there was that single player.

1098
00:56:18,651 --> 00:56:22,089
Rym: There was that adapter to the dream cast into your broadband back in the day.

1099
00:56:22,614 --> 00:56:23,909
Scott: So the GameCube had the modem.

1100
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:26,303
Rym: Yeah, which I guess was only ever.

1101
00:56:26,364 --> 00:56:27,510
Scott: PlayStation two had a modem.

1102
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:30,770
Rym: I guess those things are only ever used for fantasy star online.

1103
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,790
Rym: But I worry that this is going to go one step further.

1104
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:54,550
Rym: The really I feel like whenever people have these kinds of DRM systems nowadays, they're doing it also to prevent you from fucking around and cheating in your local single player games so that they can then have the microtransactions and have the sort of progression of achievements between you and all your friends and make it still feel cool.

1105
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:59,190
Scott: But they're not preventing anyone from cheating, because look how many people cheat at Xbox games anyway.

1106
00:56:59,932 --> 00:57:00,135
Scott: Right.

1107
00:57:00,176 --> 00:57:01,189
Scott: And stuff that's online.

1108
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:03,142
Rym: Pac-Man, CEDX is leaderboard.

1109
00:57:03,162 --> 00:57:04,270
Rym: Yeah, seriously.

1110
00:57:05,571 --> 00:57:07,609
Scott: Speaking of which, new maps for Pac-Man, CEDX.

1111
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:18,330
Scott: Now, I really want to get rid of my Xbox 360 to write, but Pac-Man, CEDX and a few other games that I have on there, that many right that I paid for, that I feel bad because I paid for them.

1112
00:57:18,691 --> 00:57:19,074
Rym: I got Pac-Man.

1113
00:57:19,115 --> 00:57:20,649
Rym: I got a half minute hero.

1114
00:57:21,232 --> 00:57:22,166
Scott: Yeah, stuff like that.

1115
00:57:22,227 --> 00:57:22,410
Scott: Right.

1116
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,910
Scott: And it's like, damn it, I made the mistake of getting an Xbox.

1117
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:27,350
Scott: And if I get rid of it, I lose those games, basically.

1118
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,870
Scott: But Pac-Man, CEDX is the only one I really care about.

1119
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:32,990
Scott: And it's on Windows eight only.

1120
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:33,847
Scott: It's like, damn it.

1121
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:37,990
Scott: I'm going to buy Windows eight just so I can get Pac-Man, CEDX on my HDPC.

1122
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,237
Rym: Really?

1123
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:40,110
Scott: Really?

1124
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:42,068
Scott: Just let me get rid of this Xbox out from under my TV.

1125
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:46,568
Scott: I think I'll just let it sit down there and collect dust and play Pac-Man when I want to.

1126
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:48,888
Scott: Yeah, I already paid for it.

1127
00:57:49,494 --> 00:57:54,650
Rym: But basically, I took the list of every game that's been announced from E3 and just in the last several weeks.

1128
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:58,229
Rym: And 90 percent of the ones I want to buy.

1129
00:57:58,693 --> 00:58:00,288
Rym: I've already been announced that they'll be on PC.

1130
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:09,462
Rym: Yeah, so or 3DS probably just going to upgrade my video card because it'll cost less than an Xbox to upgrade.

1131
00:58:09,482 --> 00:58:10,325
Rym: Mm hmm.

1132
00:58:12,633 --> 00:58:16,046
Scott: Anything else really to say about all these events that have happened at the E3?

1133
00:58:16,692 --> 00:58:17,154
Rym: Not really.

1134
00:58:17,817 --> 00:58:23,650
Rym: It's interesting watching the Internet go crazy about Sony's announcement and already start declaring Sony the winner.

1135
00:58:23,991 --> 00:58:32,190
Rym: And while they won the PR coup, never forget that normal console gamers have no idea what happened.

1136
00:58:32,752 --> 00:58:34,190
Scott: No, they have no fucking clue.

1137
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:42,330
Scott: Let me tell you, these people, the vast majority of the people who buy these consoles and these games do not Internet.

1138
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,510
Scott: They do not even know there is a PlayStation four announced.

1139
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,370
Scott: They do not know there is an Xbox one announced.

1140
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,510
Scott: They don't know anything about them.

1141
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,930
Scott: They will tell you they don't know what DRM is around the water cooler.

1142
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:57,005
Rym: Like, yeah, I heard there's a new Zelda game coming out for the Wii U. It's totally brand new and it's in 3D.

1143
00:58:58,232 --> 00:59:01,110
Rym: And they won't realize it's that remake of Link to the Past.

1144
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:01,817
Scott: They don't know.

1145
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:02,446
Scott: Well, that's for 3DS.

1146
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,887
Scott: Well, yeah, they have no idea anything that's going on.

1147
00:59:05,088 --> 00:59:05,250
Scott: Yes.

1148
00:59:06,513 --> 00:59:06,614
Rym: Right.

1149
00:59:06,634 --> 00:59:08,445
Rym: For 3DS was the point of my anecdote.

1150
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:08,827
Rym: Oh, OK.

1151
00:59:10,492 --> 00:59:10,756
Scott: Right.

1152
00:59:10,837 --> 00:59:11,608
Scott: They are clueless.

1153
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:17,190
Scott: And those people are just going to buy based on brand, most likely the same way they vote for president.

1154
00:59:17,732 --> 00:59:20,830
Scott: And if they're Halo Call of Duty people, they're going to buy Xbox ones.

1155
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:25,638
Scott: And if they're the other kind, if they're Gran Turismo people, they're going to buy PlayStations.

1156
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:26,685
Scott: And that's how it's going to be.

1157
00:59:26,706 --> 00:59:26,786
Scott: Yep.

1158
00:59:28,553 --> 00:59:31,070
Scott: All that other stuff that nerds care about will not matter.

1159
00:59:31,411 --> 00:59:35,150
Rym: Yeah, especially the things about DRM and the things about used games.

1160
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:38,830
Scott: Remember how in the PlayStation three came out, all the nerds were down on it?

1161
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,827
Scott: Well, it did OK.

1162
00:59:40,471 --> 00:59:40,691
Rym: Yeah.

1163
00:59:46,277 --> 00:59:48,400
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1164
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:53,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1165
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,960
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion, news and more.

1166
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,880
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1167
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:06,599
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1168
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1169
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,500
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1170
01:00:14,681 --> 01:00:17,560
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
