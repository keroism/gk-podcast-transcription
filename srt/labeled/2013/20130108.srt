1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:17,103
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, January 8th, I'm Rym Scott and this is GeekNights back from magfest not yet in Istanbul.

2
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:25,827
Rym: We're doing a show on viva, Java encore worlds and castles of Burgundy and magfest.

3
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:29,398
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:37,750
Rym: So I think this year after two years of magfest we can do the Colossus roar without sounding like morons.

5
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,436
Rym: No, we figured it out.

6
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:39,777
Rym: There's these.

7
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:41,323
Rym: there is actually a technique to.

8
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:43,030
Scott: it is not is not pleasant to do it.

9
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:44,295
Rym: It is that that I think.

10
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:52,666
Rym: that is why it is self-limiting because if you want to do it you're Sacrificing some of your precious throat HP to make that roar come out.

11
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:53,188
Rym: throat HP.

12
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:59,186
Scott: Your throat has HP at a convention, you know I mean even Colossus can only do it like three times on a couple quarters.

13
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:03,402
Rym: He needs more quarters I know and for me instead of quarters, it's a throat drops.

14
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,650
Scott: Yeah, how many Rico laws does it cost?

15
00:01:06,393 --> 00:01:07,930
Rym: It's like half a Rico law per shout.

16
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:18,950
Rym: Yeah But the key I realized you actually got to kind of bring your shoulders up like you're gonna make the movement and you got to Start like normal, but then you have to kind of go warbly at the end in a way.

17
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,486
Rym: That isn't pleasant and I'm not going to replicate now on the show.

18
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,961
Scott: No Well, like we can't until it's time to prepare for magfest again.

19
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:27,030
Scott: Well, you know, that would be inappropriate.

20
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:42,589
Rym: You know, we could be like those monks who will maintain a chant continuously forever, but they're like, oh Yeah, so what we need to do is get like a thousand people who will Colossus roar back and forth across like a state constantly.

21
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:53,190
Rym: But yeah, we were at magfest and we don't really want to dedicate a whole show to reviewing magfest.

22
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:58,393
Rym: So one if you want a detailed review of magfest check out our previous Reviews of magfest

23
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:09,723
Scott: because much of that is still exactly the same relevant information to this magfest such as complaining about wristbands And what magfest is like and what the building is like and what the people are like?

24
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:11,530
Rym: Yeah, so this magfest was awesome.

25
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,154
Rym: It was great.

26
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,490
Rym: I had a great time as expect it was as expected.

27
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:22,690
Rym: Yep Thanks to all of you who hung out with us played games with us came to our panels and lectures Came to that weird thing that happened at 3 in the morning on Saturday.

28
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:28,803
Rym: I don't know what to say about that except it was weird and enlightening but not in the way the people who were there think it was.

29
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:33,297
Rym: I'll just leave that Alone.

30
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:34,489
Rym: that was an interesting time.

31
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:49,864
Rym: So I want to get complaints out of the way because I don't want to leave even the various hint of an impression that magfest Is a bad convention or I really have almost nothing to complain about magfest except for the existing Wristband complaint from the prior episode.

32
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:50,650
Scott: So we're gonna leave that off.

33
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,850
Rym: Well, I do want to bring it up again because we did something different this year.

34
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:55,973
Scott: Oh, what do we do different?

35
00:02:55,993 --> 00:03:03,208
Rym: first, you know for those of you who aren't aware magfest gives everyone a wristband says it's required And it checks your ID.

36
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:10,991
Rym: So basically you wear this thing that shows whether or not you're under 18 under 21 or over 21.

37
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:15,085
Scott: No other convention I've ever been to does this ever no convention anywhere.

38
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:17,824
Scott: and this year They did have the nerve.

39
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:21,505
Scott: this year They said if you lose your wristband five bucks for a new one.

40
00:03:21,545 --> 00:03:22,389
Scott: that was new this year.

41
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,009
Rym: now What's interesting is last year?

42
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,066
Rym: They were like this wristband and this waiver and the waiver was bullshit and the wristband was bull.

43
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:29,110
Scott: at least the waiver is gone.

44
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,264
Rym: So at least I didn't have to sign the way they forced me to take the wristband.

45
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:34,610
Rym: I ripped it off in front of them.

46
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,180
Rym: They were mad but I didn't care and I took the waiver.

47
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,666
Rym: I signed Rainbow Dash.

48
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,312
Scott: I didn't do the waiver I did.

49
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:41,376
Rym: I signed Rainbow Dash.

50
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:41,999
Rym: Oh, really?

51
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,244
Scott: Yeah, they didn't give me a waiver.

52
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:44,227
Rym: Let note last year.

53
00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:47,525
Rym: Oh This year they got rid of the stupid waiver.

54
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:48,370
Scott: Well, at least I don't know.

55
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,798
Scott: I think I saw someone else signing a paper, but I don't think in our line we signed it But I'm not sure.

56
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:57,083
Rym: yeah in our line There was no waiver given or mentioned and I busted not sign one.

57
00:03:57,123 --> 00:03:58,970
Rym: last year Rainbow Dash signed one on behalf of me.

58
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:14,450
Rym: But yeah, not only did they have the audacity to say the wristband was required force you to get it they put it on you instead of just handing it to you and the sign said, you know five bucks or whatever, but Scott was like, well, I was like fine put it on me and the girl put it on really loose.

59
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:17,329
Rym: I immediately took it off and put it in my pocket and never pulled it out again.

60
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:21,829
Rym: Scott argued and I walked away and you were arguing there for like four minutes.

61
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:24,621
Scott: I just you know was having a friendly conversation about it.

62
00:04:24,862 --> 00:04:26,026
Rym: Yes, you were friendly.

63
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:30,380
Scott: to the guy's credit He saw my point when I said well, you know, don't you see?

64
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:45,984
Scott: but if you put a wristband on someone you verify that They are over 21. and if this wristband were to go to someone who was under 21 or if their ID was fake or he gave someone the wrong wristband and maybe some 17 year old gets drunk wearing a 21 year old wristband.

65
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:47,106
Scott: now that's on you.

66
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:51,269
Scott: and he said I See your point so credit to that guy.

67
00:04:51,751 --> 00:05:02,690
Rym: However two staffers there after our follow-up argument said Specifically, they don't want to do the wristbands, but the venue forces them to know the same guy.

68
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:04,529
Scott: I said who told I that was the same guy?

69
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,259
Scott: I said who told you to do this?

70
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:08,389
Scott: the same question I asked last year, but this is a different guy.

71
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,555
Scott: Yeah, and he's like.

72
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:09,857
Scott: I'm like.

73
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:11,183
Scott: did a lawyer tell you to do this.

74
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:12,570
Scott: I'm not a lawyer either.

75
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,544
Scott: I'm just asking did a lawyer tell you to do this?

76
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:21,248
Scott: and he said He said the hotel told us to do it Just been pulling that out of his derriere.

77
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:27,610
Rym: Oh, perhaps he was because one no one wears fucking wristbands at Katsucon in the same venue with a similar demographic?

78
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:29,196
Scott: Of course not and two.

79
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:34,274
Rym: I won't name names, but I talked to staff Who were more.

80
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:39,108
Rym: I guess not not just the reg guy and to quote one of these staff.

81
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:39,850
Rym: I will not name.

82
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:41,836
Rym: That is ridiculous.

83
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:43,621
Scott: I think it's ridiculous.

84
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:46,770
Rym: Also, so, you know what what but here's the thing is weird.

85
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:48,381
Rym: This is why I really want to talk about the wristbands.

86
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,689
Rym: Scott and I didn't wear ours.

87
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:52,365
Scott: I think not once were we checked for wristbands.

88
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:58,866
Rym: Not only that Everyone else at the con was wearing these grody ass barely hanging together wristbands.

89
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:03,209
Scott: by Sunday for four days They showered with the wristband three times saying this shower.

90
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:07,561
Rym: So seriously, we were the only ones without wristbands everyone.

91
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:09,345
Rym: Everyone had a fucking wristband.

92
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,210
Rym: half the guests had wristbands.

93
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:13,119
Rym: I think dr.

94
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,386
Rym: Hazard even had a wristband on.

95
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:15,070
Rym: I didn't check him.

96
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,765
Rym: I don't know what the hell's hands pocket a lot but a lot of people didn't have the wristbands.

97
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:26,302
Rym: and what's even weirder is that Scott are the only people who think the wristbands are dumb or Even think to complain about how ridiculous it is.

98
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:39,216
Rym: because if you look in the mag vest forum The only three posts about wristbands are one me complaining about them once last year me following up on my complaint Mm-hmm and someone complaining they didn't get one.

99
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:46,659
Rym: I Know well, I've noticed.

100
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:51,670
Rym: people generally accept the authority of Convention people in general and we're just dicks.

101
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:59,381
Rym: Yeah granted if that Otakon woman screams at me ever again about no cameras allowed in the line I might cry.

102
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:00,270
Scott: are you gonna cry?

103
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:04,470
Rym: I don't want to hear anyone talk to me like that ever again in my life.

104
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,521
Scott: Well, what if someone did?

105
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,289
Scott: what would you do to them?

106
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:07,053
Rym: I don't know.

107
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:14,809
Rym: I might just cry as I'm reminded of because you're upset I'm reminded of the folly but you're not gonna just get in their face and be like screw you.

108
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:16,338
Scott: Don't talk to me like that.

109
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:16,861
Scott: Well, you know what?

110
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:17,908
Rym: I might just put earplugs in.

111
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:26,581
Rym: But you know, that's pretty much my biggest Complaint about MAGFest and that's pretty minor.

112
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:27,805
Scott: That's pretty much it.

113
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,450
Scott: No rampart machine.

114
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:37,529
Rym: I guess they only have initial d3 Six and they only had like five.

115
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:41,664
Scott: d Arcade machines are all brought by private owners.

116
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:44,353
Scott: people privately own these are Machines.

117
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:48,210
Rym: the bunch of them were brought by that same group that we got a Connecticut right a private owner, right?

118
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,962
Scott: So it's oh, yeah, right.

119
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:49,752
Scott: So it's.

120
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:55,699
Scott: there are people who own these machines and they bring them to mag fest on their own Volition and then they bring them away.

121
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:56,483
Rym: I know what I'm saying.

122
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:57,610
Rym: is that my biggest complaint?

123
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,705
Scott: So you're complaining that the people who own initial d6 machines.

124
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:01,730
Scott: don't bring them to mag.

125
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:07,404
Rym: Yeah What I'm saying is the level of complaints I have for mag fest are so tiny and insignificant.

126
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:09,850
Scott: the table top library is pathetic.

127
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:15,830
Rym: yeah, the tabletop library is Worse than anime Boston's tabletop library.

128
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:18,215
Scott: It's slightly better than that.

129
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:21,044
Rym: Ah, well, okay last year's was worse.

130
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:24,994
Rym: This year's was equivalent mmm.

131
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,210
Scott: Animate Boston's tabletop library is a Dominion box and a munchkin box.

132
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,820
Rym: They had other boxes, but I like the thing is we weren't.

133
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,630
Rym: we didn't actually go there last year because we're packs the whole time.

134
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,720
Rym: So, I don't know how it's changed.

135
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,217
Scott: Yeah, they may have changed it I'm pretty sure.

136
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:39,336
Scott: so I heard it's gone Actually that I would.

137
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:45,610
Scott: I would not be surprised or at least if it's that room pretty much only Existed for that one vendor who was in there selling his monster miniatures game.

138
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:51,611
Rym: It also existed for you and me to have somewhere to go when we weren't running like it's something to do in the hotels Overnight.

139
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:57,323
Rym: also, it was a place where all our friends in Boston would meet us because they didn't actually want to go to anime Boston and no one ever checked badges.

140
00:08:57,525 --> 00:09:06,231
Rym: Yep The food and drink policy in the main con also really annoying hotels problem Problem.

141
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:24,110
Rym: what was interesting is that magfest, you know nominally enforced it and the enforcement was Spotty to the point of if you were asked to remove it Like some people would walk over you be like, dude You can't have that Red Bull in here, even though it's sealed and there's no way that could be alcohol.

142
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:27,143
Scott: Here's here's my advice for magfest from that issue.

143
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:28,890
Rym: Tell the hotel to enforce it exactly.

144
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,860
Scott: Yes, look at ConnectiCon ConnectiCon.

145
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,830
Scott: I tried to bring donuts in ConnectiCon staff Didn't give two shits about me bringing donuts.

146
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,673
Rym: Look as you were.

147
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:38,482
Scott: only the Convention Center staff gave a shit.

148
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:45,721
Scott: if you sit on the you know Heaters on the side of the way, you know The Convention Center staff are the ones who tell you don't do that.

149
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:48,930
Scott: ConnectiCon staff might be like hey guys You know, I do that too.

150
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:54,955
Scott: I'll be like, hey if I if the Convention Center staff see you doing that they're gonna tell you to stop and I'll you know Just to help people out.

151
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:58,430
Scott: funny if you're nice, but I don't actually make anyone not do it.

152
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,649
Scott: That is the Convention Center's job.

153
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:05,460
Scott: If the Convention Center does not want people bringing outside food or drink Magfest should say then you stop them.

154
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:06,625
Scott: We don't give a shit.

155
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:07,830
Scott: You can't make us do it.

156
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:18,609
Rym: But like I had some coffee I bought at the convention and they were like you can't bring that in here While they were telling me that they let a dude walk by with a big gulp that he was just drinking out of.

157
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:21,921
Scott: Well, I think number one is they were letting staff do it.

158
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:22,924
Rym: They think it wasn't staff.

159
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:23,647
Rym: who's just some right?

160
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:26,709
Scott: number two It was pretty much like selective enforcement.

161
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:36,404
Scott: I wouldn't be surprised if maybe because you did see Convention Center staff around it might have been a Convention Center staffer Telling the magfest staffers stop that guy.

162
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:37,509
Scott: Stop that guy.

163
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:41,702
Scott: Because I was the hotel.

164
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:44,274
Rym: I was listening to the Actually caring.

165
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:49,890
Rym: I was listening to the radios for magfest staff and basically there'd be a swarm of enforcement every time.

166
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,889
Rym: They carded a crazy drunk having bombed it all over person away and there were a number of them.

167
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,893
Scott: There were many back.

168
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:56,215
Scott: there was.

169
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,259
Scott: there was many.

170
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,559
Rym: there was the Willy sawdust in the lobby Or in on the lobby in the landing of our best is a 24/7 drunken fest.

171
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,041
Scott: Everyone knows this.

172
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:07,720
Rym: It is not a I believe you mean a convention.

173
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:08,162
Scott: Sure.

174
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:10,653
Scott: It's 24/7 Drunkenness.

175
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:12,380
Scott: everybody knows that's what it is.

176
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:14,267
Scott: It's not a surprise to anybody.

177
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:19,750
Rym: Yep About the drunks because they really don't get in my way and I actually find them hilarious and endearing.

178
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,748
Scott: They have never once vomited on me near me or on my things or on an arcade machine as far as I know.

179
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:30,530
Rym: so So for us our magfest the hit of the year was space war.

180
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:32,401
Scott: Well space wars.

181
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:33,870
Scott: I've done research on this.

182
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:34,655
Scott: So everyone knows.

183
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:46,790
Scott: the first video game for the pdp-1 Also the first video game ever the same way the asteroid is the first anime ever is space war Which is a game that's sort of like versus asteroids or two people try to asteroids each other, right?

184
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:57,765
Scott: There is a game a vector based game with a vector display called space wars space space Wars and it is a arcade machine that was made by a guy at MIT.

185
00:11:57,805 --> 00:12:00,361
Scott: It was basically a better space war.

186
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:07,046
Scott: right and One ship is like the enterprise and one ship is like a Star Destroyer and it has modifications.

187
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:09,936
Scott: like you turn on gravity Make the gravity stronger.

188
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:11,301
Scott: you can have a Sun.

189
00:12:11,582 --> 00:12:13,750
Scott: no Sun there is a Sun but you can't see it.

190
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,616
Scott: It's a black hole.

191
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:28,130
Scott: all these, you know variables And it is a very good direct versus one-on-one game of skill Extremely precise very much like star control 2 hyper melee with a lot less with no variation in ships.

192
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:28,512
Scott: So it's.

193
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:37,450
Scott: it's completely symmetrical in every way and it's just who gets the most Scores by killing the other guy before time runs out and time is how many quarters you put in.

194
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:42,107
Rym: It's pretty great and I played more of that than pretty much any other arcade machine.

195
00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:42,990
Rym: That was multiplayer.

196
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:44,376
Scott: Played it about the same.

197
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,119
Scott: Oh multiplayer.

198
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,224
Scott: Okay, cuz we played Dig Dug.

199
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:47,228
Rym: Yeah, we played Dig Dug.

200
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:47,770
Scott: who won Dig Dug?

201
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:51,880
Rym: You did win Dig Dug Mario brothers.

202
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,608
Scott: that were not super.

203
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:55,308
Rym: What's going on?

204
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,760
Rym: You wouldn't play nibbles or Wizard of War.

205
00:12:59,162 --> 00:12:59,584
Scott: Okay.

206
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,186
Scott: Well nibble.

207
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:01,210
Scott: Well, I did play nibble.

208
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,410
Scott: I wouldn't had a problem playing it, but there was someone at it when at the time we were gonna play it.

209
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,794
Scott: Yeah, Wizard of War.

210
00:13:05,814 --> 00:13:06,737
Scott: I had no problem playing.

211
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:08,262
Scott: who wouldn't joust.

212
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:10,469
Scott: I think I won joust also.

213
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:11,697
Rym: Who won Eclipse?

214
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,328
Rym: what Rym and Scott won Eclipse?

215
00:13:13,388 --> 00:13:15,112
Rym: both Everybody.

216
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,880
Scott: but meanwhile, I carried that Eclipse.

217
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,862
Rym: I had 41 points.

218
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:19,083
Rym: You had.

219
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:19,885
Scott: I had 41 Scott.

220
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,507
Scott: We have witnesses.

221
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:22,954
Scott: I had 41 points.

222
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:23,476
Scott: I counted 41 up.

223
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:24,038
Scott: You had 40.

224
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:24,760
Scott: I had 41.

225
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,212
Rym: I had 41 did not have 40.

226
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:30,141
Rym: Why do I need to go get Pete and Phil?

227
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:31,006
Scott: I had 41 points.

228
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:33,417
Rym: Yeah I'm just saying there are multiple people.

229
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,707
Scott: I counted two times and on my second counting.

230
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:36,672
Scott: It was 41.

231
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:38,910
Rym: I'm just saying there were multiple people there.

232
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,458
Scott: Are you sure you think I'm a hundred percent?

233
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:45,129
Scott: I counted the second time and it was 40. actually because there was one.

234
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:50,948
Rym: That game would not have gone that way and it would not have been a coalition of Rym.

235
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:56,470
Rym: and Scott Pete and Phil coalitioned early a lot allied.

236
00:13:56,551 --> 00:13:57,506
Scott: It's not a coalition alliance.

237
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,051
Scott: The

238
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:13,605
Rym: problem is they did this before Scott and I had fought and I had set up a turn where the next turn I was gonna send my entire army in because I played the guys who start way powerful Mm-hmm, and I was just gonna fuck Scott up because I get money every time I kill someone.

239
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:14,750
Rym: I was going to do it.

240
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,990
Rym: It was a foregone conclusion and then Phil and Pete allied.

241
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,103
Rym: So it comes to my turn and I'm not gonna fuck the chance of allying.

242
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,490
Rym: nor am I gonna face a coalition?

243
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,153
Rym: Yeah by myself.

244
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:30,769
Rym: So they basically lost the game by allying one turn too soon.

245
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:34,300
Rym: Had they waited I would have fucked Scott.

246
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:40,526
Rym: they would have allied it would have been them versus me and Scott would have been just Like fighting off and I would have been done and we both lost.

247
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:46,330
Scott: personally I think that the if I played Eclipse again, because this is the first time using the expansion, right?

248
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:51,378
Scott: I would continue to use The extra sciency parts, right?

249
00:14:51,418 --> 00:15:04,187
Scott: Because basically those just come out there and they hurt you as much as they help you Right, so it sort of doesn't really hurt the game and it sort of makes it like fun and tricky if you happen to get One of those right and different to those.

250
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:06,775
Rym: Yeah Like the more aliens more.

251
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:12,150
Scott: I like the more aliens and I wish we brought in some more those space hexes and more discovery things.

252
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:15,041
Rym: I wish we brought in the super dangerous ancients.

253
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:16,305
Scott: Oh that too.

254
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:17,590
Scott: That would have been awesome as well.

255
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,941
Scott: But the Alliance's I don't really like.

256
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:27,385
Scott: I kind of like this the regular Also, I would like I was the strongest and the most dangerous and the highest score.

257
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:31,343
Scott: you were hardly and I was just regular old boring humans.

258
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:38,150
Rym: You were hardly In fact, you would have been out of the game had I attacked you except for my incredibly powerful ships.

259
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,018
Scott: I was in fact, I think was that warmly one.

260
00:15:40,118 --> 00:15:48,192
Rym: yet because I started with a bunch of stuff in I think I think I was the only one to bring dreadknots on the board period cuz I can't build dreadknots Uh-huh.

261
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:49,078
Rym: I didn't need to.

262
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:53,986
Rym: I had free shields Anyway, and I could move four units for move action.

263
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:54,770
Scott: I took the center.

264
00:15:55,091 --> 00:16:00,150
Rym: I demolished Pete you took the center baby because we agreed because we had to ally.

265
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,369
Scott: It's not like you would have been able to take it from me.

266
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:06,505
Rym: I could have taken it with two fucking interceptors because of my leveled up assholes.

267
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:07,610
Scott: No wouldn't happen.

268
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:09,377
Rym: Your memory is faulty.

269
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:12,309
Rym: I'm gonna bring Pete on the show and we're gonna discuss what happened in this game.

270
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:21,539
Rym: I was the devastating army of doom Anyway, uh But yeah, I mean the concerts we went to.

271
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,105
Rym: two years of magfest.

272
00:16:23,145 --> 00:16:24,430
Rym: never been to a concert before.

273
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,992
Scott: Well the first year like, you know, two years ago That's nine.

274
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:31,430
Rym: fuck that two years ago is tiny smelly room smelled like the inside of the whole con smelled.

275
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,758
Rym: Yeah, but that room was like concentrated.

276
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:39,278
Scott: ooh to but last year just didn't go for whatever reason it was too busy doing the other things.

277
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:48,460
Scott: this year on the schedule was the you show Wasn't it?

278
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,436
Rym: The streets of rage?

279
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:49,900
Rym: I didn't know.

280
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,170
Rym: he also did actor a sir.

281
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:59,490
Scott: He did it also like shinobi and some other games but because he did the streets of rage music Which is in my eyes the second best video game music ever after the Megaman music, right?

282
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,530
Scott: I was like, I'm going to see whatever music this guy is playing.

283
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:09,450
Rym: So he ran an awesome DJ dance party and I was getting those Otakon o2 feels one.

284
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:12,781
Scott: There's a lot of videos of it on YouTube with one with good audio.

285
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:18,106
Rym: people were dancing - it was Actual dance music and not bullshit dance music.

286
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:21,329
Rym: Yeah three It did not smell at all.

287
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:26,002
Scott: It was oc remixes of video game music by the guy who originally made that music.

288
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:28,047
Rym: There was zero Bo.

289
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:29,210
Rym: it smelled like.

290
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:31,678
Rym: It's not like an empty room.

291
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:34,089
Rym: Yeah, that was amazing to me.

292
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:38,905
Rym: I cannot stress this for most of the people in that room were around my age.

293
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,486
Rym: I I think I can go back to dances at things again.

294
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:48,320
Scott: Yep The the best part of it was what's that beeping noise?

295
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:50,066
Rym: That was my Skype ringing.

296
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:51,390
Rym: Oh, I guess my Google boys.

297
00:17:51,812 --> 00:18:05,996
Scott: Oh, anyway, whatevs the best part was that you know Even though this guy he even said so that he clearly did not have a lot of live DJing skills or practice in the past Can just keep talking.

298
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,510
Rym: I don't know why I keep distracting you over here.

299
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,641
Scott: I don't know all these noises coming from your computer all over the place.

300
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:13,387
Rym: Yeah, you know what the listener can't hear them.

301
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:18,633
Scott: Yeah, okay listener anyway the What's it called?

302
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:25,730
Scott: So even though his DJ skills were low and if you watch on YouTube, you know You can see he messes up a few times like once he accidentally mutes all and brings it all back.

303
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,756
Rym: That was hilarious cuz he keeps going like this like he's like Ravens arms.

304
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:37,367
Scott: Yeah, and then there's no music and then he's like And then like a couple times like switches tracks and it gets all messed up during the transition.

305
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:37,949
Scott: it's sort of just like.

306
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:47,250
Scott: And the other song now, you know what though don't fucking care It didn't matter because the songs the music when it was going right was so good.

307
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:53,258
Rym: I'll let you guys in on a secret unless I am at a like Exhibition of DJ skills.

308
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,068
Rym: I literally do not care.

309
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:57,703
Scott: Yeah The guys a composer music.

310
00:18:57,823 --> 00:19:02,265
Scott: I would have been much at it You know, why didn't he just bring a CD and play it and dance for us, right?

311
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:03,270
Scott: I would have been just as happy.

312
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,570
Scott: I really don't give a shit if it's mixed live.

313
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:18,270
Scott: the only advantage I see to mixing live is if you can gauge the feels of the crowd and Then you could live mix, you know one part to last a little longer, you know one part to go a little harder.

314
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:25,630
Scott: Right as you see how the people's are doing out there, but if you're not capable of doing that, you know And it's also not strictly necessary.

315
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:30,301
Scott: Just play a CD of your music if it's electronic music.

316
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:36,410
Scott: unless you are creating music live You know with like Ableton something that's different again.

317
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,640
Rym: Yeah, but so I want to point something out.

318
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:45,703
Rym: the drunken gamer convention Known in the past for its horrible smell has no problem with this.

319
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,675
Rym: in a large pretty intense dance party What the fuck?

320
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:50,539
Rym: anime cons?

321
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,463
Scott: What the fuck?

322
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,150
Rym: Why do you people smell so bad?

323
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:59,274
Scott: There were some smelly people there was at least one time when I was sitting in a place and I smelled Oh, yes in the convention.

324
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:02,968
Rym: There were occasional smelly people, but you've been to anime cons.

325
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:03,510
Rym: got you walk.

326
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:06,910
Scott: Did we play any rhythm games at magfest?

327
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:12,470
Scott: Even though they had an excellent selection of B money I did and they didn't smell like anything.

328
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,726
Rym: The only place that smelled bad was the PC gaming area.

329
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:16,510
Scott: I didn't go there.

330
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,764
Rym: I walked over there and it smelled somebody in the LAN party smelled like a butt.

331
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:22,650
Rym: Mmm the entire time.

332
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:23,635
Rym: I do not know who.

333
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:26,750
Scott: there is also the factor of the PC game gaming area.

334
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:31,229
Scott: Someone may have brought their smelly butt computer from their smelly butt house.

335
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:34,798
Scott: No Blowing their smelly butt all over thing is.

336
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:37,990
Rym: smelly butt from a computer usually just smells like stale cigarette smoke.

337
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,839
Rym: This was the ode to fat fanboy.

338
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:44,450
Scott: There have been cases of poop in computers in the past.

339
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:47,758
Scott: It has happened.

340
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:49,228
Rym: I will not deny that.

341
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:52,170
Scott: Has happened anything else to say about magfest?

342
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,900
Rym: Oh, they expanded the arcade and they expanded tabletop to her.

343
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,450
Rym: tabletop was as big as the arcade and was in a room with windows.

344
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,797
Scott: Well, no, it wasn't as big as the arcade.

345
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:06,110
Scott: there was a significant area that was taken up by table flipping for charity.

346
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:13,889
Scott: While it looked fun that area turned into tabletop when the tabletop flipping was not happening and it was for charity Which is always laudable.

347
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:21,870
Scott: It was annoying to have it next to tabletop But you do your table flipping in a place where noise doesn't really matter like maybe near the video game.

348
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,030
Rym: There was also a great moment where a guy paid a lot of money to stack three tables on each other.

349
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:27,842
Rym: I'm really surprised.

350
00:21:27,882 --> 00:21:28,849
Rym: He didn't break his face.

351
00:21:29,383 --> 00:21:30,408
Scott: Yeah It was you know.

352
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:34,561
Scott: No Very few people were able to flip the table in an elegant and awesome way.

353
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,748
Scott: many just sort of flipped them like derp.

354
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:41,963
Rym: it flipped Okay Interesting you can get charity money for letting people do something.

355
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:47,788
Rym: They can easily do in their own homes, but You get some charity money, but again, just don't do it in tabletop.

356
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:48,331
Rym: next year Do.

357
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:50,760
Scott: tabletop needs to be more quiet than the other places.

358
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,406
Rym: Yes, cuz we need to play games.

359
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:55,678
Rym: Yes I'm not magnificent fucking awesome.

360
00:21:55,718 --> 00:21:56,722
Rym: Our panels went great.

361
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,450
Rym: We had cool talks about stuff.

362
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,310
Scott: How could you not go to mag fests if you're a gaming person anywhere nearby?

363
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,342
Rym: And I'm gonna tell you guys this now though.

364
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:07,355
Rym: It's not relevant yet I learned you know ConnectiCon.

365
00:22:07,415 --> 00:22:10,202
Rym: we schedule like 220 230 panels every year.

366
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:10,643
Rym: Mm-hmm.

367
00:22:10,804 --> 00:22:12,708
Rym: We get submissions in the four digits.

368
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:18,690
Rym: Yep Magfest gets submissions in the double digits and they have a very tiny number of panel rooms.

369
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:22,225
Rym: I want them to get more panel rooms when they open up panels.

370
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:23,330
Scott: They have a lot of panel rooms.

371
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,690
Scott: They had like six panel rooms, but they most of them are just empty all the time.

372
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:32,070
Rym: Yeah, they really don't have a panel culture and the biggest complaint I saw is that there weren't enough panels grant.

373
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,315
Scott: There's not a lot of feedback.

374
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:36,530
Scott: the mag fest online community forum is very small.

375
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:43,050
Rym: Yes, so if you want to go to mag fest submit a panel they kind of use some submissions.

376
00:22:43,491 --> 00:22:47,987
Scott: Well, they also need to accept more percentage to fill their really just every.

377
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:53,993
Scott: if you have a panel room There should be something in that panel room with breaks in between all the time And they have.

378
00:22:54,294 --> 00:22:55,800
Scott: you know, their con goes overnight.

379
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,070
Scott: So why aren't they using the rooms overnight for things?

380
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:58,652
Rym: Well, they give it us.

381
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:01,361
Rym: I mean we would have happily done another lecture.

382
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:03,950
Rym: Yeah, we only did one lecture and two panels.

383
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:06,566
Rym: We would have done more but they didn't want him but then there was empty space.

384
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:06,969
Rym: I don't know.

385
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,648
Scott: The final thing about mag fest is mag fest next year.

386
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:20,696
Scott: now We've already been encouraging you to go to mag fest as you should every year and multiple listeners came out to me and said Something to the effect of.

387
00:23:20,837 --> 00:23:24,050
Rym: I'm glad I finally listened to you guys and came to mag fest.

388
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:29,861
Scott: you should listen to us and everything we say including don't listen to this podcast, but The listener might disagree.

389
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:34,103
Scott: if you don't listen to this podcast It may be hard for you to get our other advice on things.

390
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:35,570
Scott: You should do because that's right.

391
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:43,191
Scott: Anyway, don't do it Donnie don't does Next year at mag fest the miracle I've been waiting for For?

392
00:23:43,814 --> 00:23:47,510
Scott: I think it's ten years if probably possibly more than ten years.

393
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:51,370
Rym: There was a moment when I think Scott is definitely me to this band.

394
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:52,799
Scott: No, I can definitely.

395
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:54,570
Scott: I can tell you exactly how this happened.

396
00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,064
Scott: All right, we discovered it in the colony apartment of Alex and Greg.

397
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,050
Rym: I know it was cut was it Alex?

398
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,689
Scott: I think it was Greg slash Alex.

399
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:23,018
Scott: They had already known about it and we discovered they had shared it to us by playing it there during D&D which means it was in the year of 2001 or 2 and But now in the year of 2014, so Twelve years later minimum.

400
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,145
Scott: I don't know how they lasted that long.

401
00:24:25,185 --> 00:24:26,490
Scott: I guess they're just that awesome.

402
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:41,790
Scott: finally Finally in the United States for the first time ever it is confirmed 100% unless something happens to the cancellation and I might have to hurt myself Machine supremacy is gonna be a mag fest.

403
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:44,504
Rym: You may know them as mock and I supremacy and one.

404
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:48,609
Scott: you're wrong because well We used to say that because you look at the name and that's what it fucking says.

405
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,482
Scott: But in case you want don't want to get it wrong.

406
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:57,007
Scott: if you watch concert video Nobody stands out in the audience going machine supremacy.

407
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:57,127
Scott: Whoo?

408
00:24:57,911 --> 00:25:00,439
Scott: Everyone just says ma sue mas.

409
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,490
Scott: so you can just say masu and it's the easy way out.

410
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:13,864
Rym: You know, you can't get it wrong saying that I am the most excited about seeing them perform live that I've been for any live Performance of any music in my life.

411
00:25:14,205 --> 00:25:20,630
Scott: I am a hundred percent In a thousand percent agreement, so we're gonna be at that concert.

412
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:25,166
Rym: We're probably gonna line up for that line up at least two hours in advance.

413
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:29,548
Scott: I'm gonna be next I don't know how long in advance you gotta line up.

414
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:35,655
Rym: If someone if someone could give me the good hookup, which I very rarely ask for This is my wife.

415
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:36,799
Scott: I'm gonna use a hookup.

416
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,224
Scott: This is what I'm gonna use it.

417
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:48,310
Scott: I better be in that room somewhere close To the front part and not the back part, but the front part and a little bit to the right for the entire time.

418
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:49,835
Scott: Duration of the thing.

419
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:53,408
Scott: Oh my god, and maybe they'll come play arcade games with us.

420
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:53,770
Scott: Who knows?

421
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:54,489
Scott: I don't know.

422
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,193
Rym: I learned this.

423
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:58,750
Rym: I was at mag fest because I was supposed to go to Istanbul Sunday after mag.

424
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,614
Rym: I learned it later.

425
00:25:59,634 --> 00:26:06,309
Scott: We only confirmation I have is a bunch of tweets of people I guess to assume went to closing ceremonies and heard it there.

426
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:13,268
Rym: now I was going to go to closing ceremonies But instead I was trying to frantically figure out if I was going to Istanbul or not and ended up not.

427
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:24,100
Scott: I did not Believe these tweets until one of said tweets was retweeted by machine supremacy's Twitter account itself Which is a hundred percent confirmation in the book of Scott.

428
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,708
Rym: or they're mocking us or they're mocking us.

429
00:26:26,748 --> 00:26:29,110
Scott: in which case Good job guys you win.

430
00:26:29,511 --> 00:26:40,325
Rym: but I saw this tweet while I was pooping in my hotel room and the poop came out real fast and I was like I Should probably get a second source before I say anything.

431
00:26:40,345 --> 00:26:43,057
Scott: when I saw that I just Really hit retreat.

432
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:45,410
Rym: I didn't even didn't even think about it.

433
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:51,206
Rym: I was like if this is wrong that I don't want to be right about it being wrong.

434
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:52,450
Scott: and this is now.

435
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,968
Scott: Magfest is beating packs in two areas.

436
00:26:56,028 --> 00:27:06,656
Scott: now I think it may even be pulling closely to equal to packs the fact that it's arcade is vastly superior Yeah, and it's concerts are now Vastly superior.

437
00:27:06,736 --> 00:27:11,230
Rym: Alright, so what magfest doesn't have yet to bring it up to PAX level for us is one tabletop.

438
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:13,800
Rym: It doesn't have a proper tabletop.

439
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:14,242
Scott: Mm-hmm.

440
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:16,370
Rym: It does not have panels.

441
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:17,776
Rym: Well, it doesn't.

442
00:27:17,896 --> 00:27:20,668
Rym: not only does not have panels really any expo holic did the.

443
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:21,170
Rym: I don't care.

444
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:25,109
Rym: I'm saying it doesn't for us mean Scott, you know the best place for pinky.

445
00:27:25,892 --> 00:27:31,670
Rym: It does not have the sort of scope and scale of panels and lectures that I prefer.

446
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,881
Rym: I mean, I like presenting at magfest is very intimate setting.

447
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:35,604
Rym: It's very fun.

448
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:42,103
Rym: I can say fuck a lot But I'm more enjoy the sort of polished.

449
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:44,590
Rym: There is a giant audience who can't interact with me.

450
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:53,077
Scott: Yes way of presenting, you know packs also is falling behind a magfest in only one other aspects Machine supremacist.

451
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:54,868
Scott: No story already said that part the concerts.

452
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:58,161
Scott: The super art fight is at magfest and not at packs.

453
00:27:58,241 --> 00:28:00,510
Rym: it is and that was a really good super art fight.

454
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,892
Scott: It was.

455
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,930
Rym: I was a pretty good one team stomp it on really should have won that.

456
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:11,096
Scott: That was the only time in a super art fight in which the team that I believed was worthy of winning Was not the winning team.

457
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,843
Rym: I was actually kind of sad about that.

458
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:17,722
Rym: I was like I'd never felt that Bowser in the top, right?

459
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:22,789
Scott: It was all about that Venusaur with the two whips going and the look on his face.

460
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:23,934
Scott: I know it was so.

461
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:28,030
Scott: as soon as I saw the Venusaur I was like, that's a winner and the somehow they didn't win.

462
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,450
Scott: What do they were up against like some Metroids and angry cloud, but they were up against the standbys.

463
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:35,185
Rym: The people are basically usually only beaten by yuko.

464
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:37,252
Scott: Yeah, it's They.

465
00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:40,950
Rym: if anyone's gonna challenge yuko's undefeated throne, it's gonna be stomp it on.

466
00:28:41,231 --> 00:28:42,638
Scott: I really want to see.

467
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,689
Rym: I want to see yuko versus stomp it on.

468
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:53,017
Scott: well Yes But I really want to see like I had this vision while I was watching super art fight a vision super art fight The TV show.

469
00:28:53,037 --> 00:29:05,610
Scott: it's like once a week maybe maybe once a day Whatever right and it's a real tournament, which I think they do anyway, but it's sort, you know It would be like professional wrestling maybe, you know with because it's already going in that direction with the belt.

470
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,475
Rym: All right I have a crazy idea.

471
00:29:07,575 --> 00:29:12,750
Scott: bring in lots of artists and big-name artists of all kind.

472
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:18,950
Rym: I have a crazy crazy idea right like, you know, we're friends with them and they're gonna be a ConnectiCon.

473
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:19,753
Rym: We always bring them back.

474
00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:24,270
Rym: We're gonna make sure they don't get fucked by the stupid cosplay ConnectiCon this year.

475
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:30,719
Rym: But more importantly do you want to talk to them and We don't speak for them.

476
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,110
Rym: This is just us being dumbasses.

477
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:44,309
Rym: we could get a crew and film the entire thing with a bunch of cameras and Edit it together into a show for them to use as a pilot Which would also be a big marketing thing for ConnectiCon.

478
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:46,434
Scott: We'll see what happens.

479
00:29:46,514 --> 00:29:48,802
Scott: I'm just saying they should really.

480
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:50,126
Scott: they're going to the west coast.

481
00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:51,130
Scott: So they're already getting bigger.

482
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,365
Rym: Right, let's try to pull strings to get them into packs.

483
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:54,990
Scott: we got it.

484
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,310
Rym: Let's try to get you know What.

485
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:57,756
Rym: let's see if they'll let.

486
00:29:57,816 --> 00:29:59,743
Rym: if they won't let them headline for like a main event.

487
00:30:00,205 --> 00:30:03,474
Rym: see if they can headline for us Like super are fine.

488
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:06,864
Rym: and then GeekNights does their talk about that would be us mooching on them.

489
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:07,747
Scott: Exactly.

490
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:20,169
Rym: It's no good Like that one lecture of ours where it's the video starts with crazy applause and it cuts out the part right before that run like Let's give the enforcers a round of applause.

491
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:31,721
Scott: Anyway, let's move on to the rest of our show The things of the day.

492
00:30:31,942 --> 00:30:37,365
Rym: I'm gonna be a little self-serving But I got a video I uploaded and I'm making this my thing of the day.

493
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:38,229
Rym: You're not allowed to do that.

494
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:40,903
Rym: I'm a nerd who's into my nerdy thing.

495
00:30:41,245 --> 00:30:42,270
Rym: And this is a nerdy thing.

496
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,254
Rym: I'm really into that.

497
00:30:43,295 --> 00:31:04,494
Rym: a lot of you probably should nerd out about at least a little but - I went through great trouble to acquire these videos, so this is a Performing three songs in late 1996.

498
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:06,088
Rym: You know, what's awesome about this video?

499
00:31:06,108 --> 00:31:11,070
Rym: I Still have a mustache in it, but you can't really see because this is just a video of one of the performance.

500
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,073
Scott: You're a white stick.

501
00:31:12,634 --> 00:31:13,858
Rym: Yes, but there are other.

502
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,924
Rym: I have video walking stick 97 98 99 as well.

503
00:31:18,692 --> 00:31:23,648
Rym: And in those later videos, there are close-ups of me doing solos and you can clearly see the mustache.

504
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,689
Rym: I look older than than I do now.

505
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,450
Rym: It's kind of amazing.

506
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:32,950
Rym: But I was pretty proud of my high school marching band and this is my high school marching band doing its marching band thing.

507
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:35,777
Rym: No one else has uploaded this on the internet.

508
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:40,676
Rym: and it brought up another interesting thing because I was talking to my friend Ken Who is in this video?

509
00:31:40,917 --> 00:31:43,869
Rym: Also, he's a bass drummer and we went to high school together.

510
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:45,342
Rym: He's in the forum.

511
00:31:45,382 --> 00:31:45,950
Rym: He's Ken Jura.

512
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:52,789
Rym: So if he's still here, you guys can be like, oh, that's that dude the one guy who has evidence of pre RIT Rym.

513
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:53,170
Scott: great.

514
00:31:54,352 --> 00:32:05,030
Rym: That dude and I were in the marching band together and we started talking about how basically anything that happened before about 2003 or four really just isn't on the fucking internet.

515
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:13,681
Rym: No, like there are so few videos of things before then like now a kid growing up you're in college You're like, hey, I wonder if there's a video of my.

516
00:32:13,882 --> 00:32:18,829
Rym: you know, the time I was in Middle school football and YouTube will have a million hits.

517
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:23,986
Rym: So we're one of the last generations to grow up in an era where there is not an archive.

518
00:32:24,427 --> 00:32:29,550
Scott: there is it's just on VHS tapes that no one transferred to digital exactly and they're disappearing rapidly again.

519
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:34,864
Rym: I went through such ridiculous trouble to get just this tape.

520
00:32:35,065 --> 00:32:35,727
Scott: What did you do?

521
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:38,962
Rym: All right, so Three years ago.

522
00:32:38,982 --> 00:32:48,258
Rym: I Emailed the company that I knew had last had an archival copy of this Asking if I could buy one.

523
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:48,741
Rym: Mm-hmm.

524
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:49,785
Rym: I got no response.

525
00:32:50,167 --> 00:33:01,807
Rym: All right Yeah, I tried other avenues of inquiry ranging from contacting the school Trying to contact people I knew in high school, which is basically impossible.

526
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:03,599
Rym: as far as I know everyone I knew in high school is dead.

527
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,129
Rym: Okay, I Basically tried to contact anyone I could who would have these videos.

528
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:18,870
Rym: My younger brother has two of the videos because we overlapped in high school a little bit But he did not have the early videos because he was not yet in high school.

529
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:24,108
Rym: One of my VHS tapes had been destroyed when I was in high school.

530
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:26,920
Rym: Ken did not have it anymore.

531
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:28,168
Rym: No one had them.

532
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,680
Rym: Eventually a few months ago.

533
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,997
Rym: I got an email from the guy I'd emailed years before Responding like nothing had happened.

534
00:33:35,118 --> 00:33:40,449
Rym: Just like he'd just seen the email was like hey, yeah 70 bucks a tape and I'll transcribe him to DVD.

535
00:33:41,431 --> 00:33:52,309
Rym: Okay, and I was like, I don't really want to pay a hundred and forty dollars But I'm not going to regret not having paid Because those won't be around forever.

536
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,194
Rym: And I've got him.

537
00:33:54,797 --> 00:34:01,629
Rym: and then Oh God was it a pain in the ass to get the audio to even Vaguely match up with the video from a VHS tape.

538
00:34:03,212 --> 00:34:05,242
Rym: And it looks pretty good for a VHS tape and I'm proud of this.

539
00:34:05,282 --> 00:34:06,207
Rym: So that's my thing of the day.

540
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:07,976
Rym: great What do you got?

541
00:34:08,056 --> 00:34:08,841
Rym: video of a cat.

542
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:12,293
Scott: so this is I Can't research it that.

543
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:17,210
Scott: well, you're doing the snuff film because Russian but this may be a sort of a snuff film.

544
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:20,168
Scott: But what if a snuff film does not include the actual?

545
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,552
Scott: Death right?

546
00:34:21,572 --> 00:34:26,429
Scott: Like what if I had a video of a guy shooting a gun and then right before the bullet hit the person.

547
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,259
Scott: It was the end of the video.

548
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:28,188
Scott: Would that be a snuff film?

549
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,119
Rym: I'm not much of a connoisseur of snuff films But I think you should watch the film 8 millimeter.

550
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,690
Rym: that might tell you a lot about the subculture around stuff films.

551
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:37,521
Rym: Have you ever seen a millimeter?

552
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:38,387
Scott: I'd never heard of it.

553
00:34:38,427 --> 00:34:41,498
Rym: All right Nicholas cage great, but it's good.

554
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:43,563
Rym: This is a video and it's fucked up.

555
00:34:44,106 --> 00:34:51,110
Scott: like many internet videos This sort of falls into the owned category the Russian owned category, which is a large subsection of the own guy.

556
00:34:52,051 --> 00:35:01,258
Scott: Some guys are doing some ridiculous thing rolling down a snow hill at a ski mountain in a big inflatable ball Thing that they're on the inside of.

557
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:03,385
Rym: so Scott showed me this video and the whole time.

558
00:35:03,426 --> 00:35:04,610
Rym: I'm like that looks fun.

559
00:35:05,113 --> 00:35:05,656
Rym: I would do that.

560
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:07,105
Rym: Oh, man, look at it go.

561
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,237
Rym: Oh, man Is he gonna hit that guy like?

562
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:10,485
Rym: I'm waiting for what the funny part is.

563
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:19,110
Scott: It's not just like wait Wait, eventually it just rolls off a steep cliff with jagged rocks and the guys are still inside.

564
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:22,090
Scott: And then you just see it go over the edge and that's it down the mountain.

565
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:28,690
Scott: It's just gone according to the comments like one person died and the other ones didn't do so well, but aren't dead.

566
00:35:29,314 --> 00:35:30,262
Scott: so who knows.

567
00:35:30,282 --> 00:35:35,330
Rym: but Oral is that this hobby is a terrible hobby.

568
00:35:35,671 --> 00:35:41,695
Scott: The moral is is that when you're watching the early part of the video like Rym said it looks Mostly really kind of safe.

569
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:44,344
Rym: It looks like the guy like I. doesn't happen.

570
00:35:44,505 --> 00:35:46,010
Rym: It does one guy like chasing it.

571
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,020
Rym: I thought it was gonna like roll back and hit him or something.

572
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,990
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't look dangerous at all.

573
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:53,601
Scott: It looks totally chill and this is why I don't go skiing.

574
00:35:53,822 --> 00:35:58,737
Scott: because things like this even though I know they're not skiing in this But still got stuff like that doesn't happen.

575
00:35:58,818 --> 00:36:10,678
Scott: skiing unless you're in Russia and then okay, so in Phil mr Ski Patrol, I'm like, hey Phil skiing so dangerous and he says he's never been hurt skiing But everyone else gets her skiing.

576
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:12,986
Rym: It's got Judith Natalie Emily all ski.

577
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:13,970
Rym: Did they get hurt?

578
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:21,010
Rym: One of those three got hurt minorly once and required no more than two or three stitches.

579
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,235
Scott: Oh, that's all.

580
00:36:22,356 --> 00:36:27,490
Rym: I've only been knocked unconscious once and I didn't break my neck that time only been knocked unconscious.

581
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:30,661
Rym: Yolo, that's all Yolo man.

582
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:32,508
Scott: You know how many times I hurt myself playing ns2.

583
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:41,848
Rym: I'm gonna laugh a little bit Ten years from now when you've got carpal tunnel from playing ns2 and you're crippled by it And then you get hit by a car on your bike.

584
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:43,593
Scott: You know what?

585
00:36:44,075 --> 00:36:45,902
Scott: side story side story.

586
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:48,110
Scott: It's open enrollment at work for the benefits.

587
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:52,003
Rym: I was looking at a disability insurance and you thought about picking on it.

588
00:36:52,063 --> 00:36:54,270
Scott: They want to charge you fucking 15 bucks a paycheck.

589
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:55,096
Scott: I'm like, fuck you.

590
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:56,305
Scott: That's a dollar a day.

591
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:59,197
Scott: I'm not betting $365 that I'm gonna get hurt this year.

592
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:02,630
Rym: Can I buy it on your behalf if I get the money?

593
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:04,553
Scott: What do you mean?

594
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:05,034
Rym: like?

595
00:37:05,115 --> 00:37:09,289
Rym: I'll pay for your disability insurance, but as you get disabled you have to give all the checks to me.

596
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:14,305
Scott: I Would get all the checks and I wouldn't give them to you.

597
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:15,370
Rym: Well, then I wouldn't pay for it.

598
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:19,910
Rym: Would you agree to sign a contract where I will pay your disability insurance?

599
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,549
Rym: I'll pay that $15 a paycheck for you, but then you have to give me you.

600
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:26,194
Scott: just Don't put me into this.

601
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:35,590
Rym: just go find an insurance company that will sell you reverse insurance because the insurance company will recognize the perverse Incentive that I am now basically incentivized to injure you severely.

602
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:42,136
Rym: So whatever they're gonna charge you is what they're gonna charge you but the $15 is probably much better than that And we'll both make out.

603
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:43,725
Scott: How am I gonna make out?

604
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:46,513
Rym: I'll be to say You look at $15.

605
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:47,977
Rym: No, I won't.

606
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:50,102
Scott: that dollars would go to the insurance company.

607
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:50,764
Rym: fine.

608
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:52,628
Rym: I'll give you 10% of the disability.

609
00:37:55,012 --> 00:37:57,003
Scott: Are you gonna attack me and disable me?

610
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:59,884
Rym: Uh Not directly.

611
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:04,890
Scott: no Do things to put my life in danger so I may become disabled.

612
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:09,402
Rym: Anyway in the meta moment the book club book is the great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald.

613
00:38:09,443 --> 00:38:10,205
Rym: You should read it.

614
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:11,710
Rym: I started reading it.

615
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,136
Rym: I'll probably done with it really soon.

616
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:20,250
Rym: I didn't start reading it because because I'm going to Istanbul and I got a bunch of long flights, uh We got stuff on the internet.

617
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:23,829
Rym: We got a bunch of videos from magfest last year that I'm gonna link to.

618
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:30,270
Rym: We're going to have a bunch of videos from magfest this year including hopefully video of the three panels and lectures.

619
00:38:30,372 --> 00:38:31,400
Rym: We were on Mm-hmm.

620
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:35,830
Rym: I'm not doing a music video this year because you guys really don't fucking care about those things enough for me to bother.

621
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,182
Scott: I'm gonna upload some photos and also super art.

622
00:38:38,243 --> 00:38:39,529
Scott: fight time-lapse.

623
00:38:39,871 --> 00:38:51,870
Rym: We're gonna try to resume a regular schedule of both radio free equestria and GeekNights presents as soon as we can But they will come sooner if you guys get our videos more out there on the internet.

624
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:56,090
Rym: They're not getting enough views for me to put any more effort into him than I'm already putting into it.

625
00:38:56,151 --> 00:39:01,130
Scott: I feel like this episode is getting long But that's okay cuz you haven't done one in a while and also there isn't gonna be one for a while.

626
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,919
Rym: Yeah, there won't be any until for at least two weeks.

627
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,266
Scott: Let's let's keep going here.

628
00:39:04,748 --> 00:39:07,476
Scott: All right, so Oh, yeah conventions.

629
00:39:07,536 --> 00:39:09,285
Scott: The next one is PAX East.

630
00:39:09,506 --> 00:39:10,350
Scott: That's all we got right.

631
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:13,081
Rym: now We're gonna be there and then we're gonna be a pax awesome ConnectiCon right?

632
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,367
Rym: Okay, so PAX Prime.

633
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:16,034
Scott: Yep So let's talk.

634
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:16,878
Rym: and then I fast.

635
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:23,407
Scott: we've been playing some a lot of new tabletop games recently But we haven't played any of them enough to really give a full-on episode.

636
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,721
Scott: So we're just gonna Briefly talk about three.

637
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:27,825
Scott: We've played recently.

638
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:31,046
Rym: The first one is castles of a burgundy.

639
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:34,770
Scott: So castle burgundy, I consider these impressions not review.

640
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:38,730
Scott: Yeah, so I bought this because it was highly ranked on board game geek and I wanted to buy a new game.

641
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:39,858
Scott: So I bought it and I learned it.

642
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:41,350
Scott: we played it and playing it.

643
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,073
Scott: It was a lot.

644
00:39:42,274 --> 00:39:43,660
Scott: it gave me that same feel.

645
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:45,610
Scott: not saying the game feels like a curricula.

646
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:49,810
Scott: Learning it felt like a curricula and we're going through the rules is a whole bunch of shit.

647
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,517
Scott: But then once you actually play it's like oh This game is pretty straightforward.

648
00:39:54,878 --> 00:39:55,580
Rym: See for me.

649
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,366
Rym: It felt like Attica.

650
00:39:57,386 --> 00:39:59,292
Scott: Oh With the hexes.

651
00:39:59,332 --> 00:40:00,896
Rym: Yes visually in that.

652
00:40:00,957 --> 00:40:03,564
Rym: no also in terms of the actions I'm taking Oh filling.

653
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:14,660
Rym: any only difference between this and Attica On that level is that there's the meta mechanic of you're gathering the tiles from a shared place Rather than everyone has their own completely solitaire game.

654
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:15,542
Scott: Yep.

655
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:18,070
Scott: So here's how ours our castle of burgundy works.

656
00:40:18,171 --> 00:40:21,310
Scott: You have a an estate which is a big plot of land.

657
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:29,837
Scott: That's a hexagon with a lot of little hexes in it and there is a shared board from which you can acquire Hexetiles and other goods and resources.

658
00:40:30,438 --> 00:40:36,738
Scott: what you want to do is on your turn you roll some dice and those dice Determine what actions will be available to you.

659
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,870
Scott: You can use some resources to sort of modify the dice.

660
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:46,050
Scott: So it's not a complete luck fest like settlers But it does cost you more resources if you want to change your dice a lot.

661
00:40:46,472 --> 00:40:50,450
Scott: So you have to be efficient and sort of go with the flow instead of trying to fight.

662
00:40:50,651 --> 00:41:01,850
Scott: You know your way to do what you want and you gather hexes and place them on your board Whenever you when you basically you gather a hex with one action and you add the hex to your estate with a second action.

663
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:08,210
Scott: When you add the hex to your estate the hex the tile you put does something.

664
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:11,090
Scott: So if you add a castle to your estate, you get another action.

665
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:15,405
Scott: If you add a building to your estate, it usually does a specific extra action.

666
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:21,690
Scott: if you add Animals to your estate you get victory points based on the animals, you know.

667
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:28,421
Scott: So you're trying to gather specific hexes to do specific things But everyone else is grabbing at him too.

668
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:30,090
Scott: So you're looking at what the other people are doing.

669
00:41:30,432 --> 00:41:33,165
Scott: If another guy's got sheep, do you want to take sheep away from him?

670
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:36,430
Scott: So he doesn't score a lot Yes, but then you have to put the sheep somewhere.

671
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:43,289
Scott: So you want to go get cows which he's not getting so you can score big and then he takes a cow to stop you And so on and so forth.

672
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,015
Scott: Is there anything else about this game?

673
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:47,538
Scott: I think it's really good and I want to play it more.

674
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,380
Rym: It's really fun.

675
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:50,245
Rym: It's relatively light.

676
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:57,305
Rym: I Think it's gonna break down for us relatively quickly and that the decisions are pretty obvious.

677
00:41:57,426 --> 00:42:01,903
Scott: once you figure out they do have Alternate boards we do we can really mix things up.

678
00:42:02,024 --> 00:42:02,486
Scott: Basically.

679
00:42:02,546 --> 00:42:03,530
Rym: It's gonna be like Attica.

680
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:14,050
Rym: It's really fun until you figure out a few reasonably optimal pads and then it'll become pretty random And I don't know anyone who's going to be willing to put forth whatever effort it would take to step up the game.

681
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:26,170
Rym: It's gonna have an endgame like Agricola in the sense that among skilled players of Agricola the game really just comes down to Whether or not you can cock other people out of certain resource things at key times.

682
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,000
Scott: But cocking someone out of something also cocks yourself, right?

683
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:37,449
Rym: So and yeah, but that matters more you want you want to play your optimal You know solo while simultaneously cocking the other players as much as you can.

684
00:42:37,993 --> 00:42:40,450
Rym: But that's a really kind of third or fourth order skill.

685
00:42:40,598 --> 00:42:42,136
Rym: Yeah I worry the game is gonna break down in that.

686
00:42:42,156 --> 00:42:46,536
Scott: for and I know but the other thing is right a lot of games out There tend to be when there were.

687
00:42:46,556 --> 00:42:49,630
Scott: there's a lot of different ways to get points a lot of different paths to victory.

688
00:42:50,252 --> 00:42:53,464
Scott: It tends to be the way to go is to pick one and min max it right.

689
00:42:53,525 --> 00:42:58,920
Scott: go all in on that and all Not in on any other things and each player Picks a different thing to go all in on.

690
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:04,950
Scott: if two people go all in on the same thing They compete and thus bringing each other down below the players who go solo.

691
00:43:05,312 --> 00:43:07,829
Scott: So like one guy went all animals he'd win.

692
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:12,329
Scott: But if two people went all animals they would lose and the guy who went all castle would win, right?

693
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,950
Scott: So but in this game you sort in order to get enough victory points like Agricola.

694
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:20,200
Scott: You need to get victory points from all the different areas.

695
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:20,902
Scott: You can't min.

696
00:43:20,942 --> 00:43:22,506
Scott: You can't maximize one thing.

697
00:43:22,547 --> 00:43:23,590
Scott: That won't be enough points.

698
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:35,918
Scott: So in that sense, it's sort of just like who does better Overall You know and there isn't really this sort of you know Picking a thing or any particular strategy user.

699
00:43:35,998 --> 00:43:40,664
Scott: roll your dice and figure out the way to get the most victory points with what you got to work with.

700
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:48,170
Rym: So we played core worlds exactly once having learned it in its entirety with a big expansion attached to it.

701
00:43:48,551 --> 00:43:53,208
Scott: Well, apparently that expansion was like already planned when the original game was put out.

702
00:43:53,469 --> 00:44:01,910
Scott: Yeah Our board games have Included DLC right so much so that symbols that only meant something in the expansion were already on the cards.

703
00:44:02,171 --> 00:44:05,965
Rym: But this particular set of core will leave race for the galaxy had the same thing going.

704
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:09,852
Scott: so maybe but this particular Set was one that you can buy Someone else.

705
00:44:09,893 --> 00:44:10,434
Scott: it wasn't ours.

706
00:44:10,495 --> 00:44:11,177
Scott: Someone else had it.

707
00:44:11,538 --> 00:44:15,030
Scott: that had the expansion and the original game together in one box.

708
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:19,850
Rym: No, I realized after I played this that I had played core worlds once before at nerd NYC.

709
00:44:21,676 --> 00:44:25,758
Rym: but I played the base game and It's it's a Dominion like.

710
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:33,950
Rym: but more people called it an ascension like and having played it twice It is basically just a complicated ascension in my opinion.

711
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:38,190
Scott: Well, it's a little better than ascension because in ascension you just engine is not even a game.

712
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:42,570
Scott: I said you just play your whole hand every turn and then pick the best card on the table and that's it.

713
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,613
Scott: There isn't really anything.

714
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:47,426
Rym: there's no way to do better at ascension really in this game.

715
00:44:47,747 --> 00:44:56,510
Scott: There were Some things that you could work on Distorting it but I think the number one thing going on in is a deck building game, right?

716
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:00,250
Scott: And usually the thing in deck building games is it's hard to call your deck, right?

717
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:05,528
Scott: Like in Dominion you want to trash so that you can get a really efficient deck in core worlds.

718
00:45:06,391 --> 00:45:18,550
Scott: Almost every turn you get to put cards underneath, you know your Your city is basically automatic and building and whenever you do a battle You can put your a guy who is in the battle under the city hall.

719
00:45:18,651 --> 00:45:21,867
Scott: So it's so easy to get rid of all these shitty guys under your deck.

720
00:45:21,987 --> 00:45:23,632
Scott: I actually Didn't?

721
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,102
Scott: I played the game wrong?

722
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:25,706
Scott: Remember?

723
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:35,483
Scott: Yeah I had two extra basically an extra copper and an extra estate it to put in Dominion terms You know an extra star fighter and an extra column in my deck to begin with.

724
00:45:35,804 --> 00:45:56,790
Scott: so I had two extra cards to trash and I ended up doing super well And getting all these freaking colonies What's it called capital capital ships colony ships and I was super powerful and awesome and scored two core worlds at the end of the game With that because the trashing was so easy and I never forgot to do the trashing.

725
00:45:57,471 --> 00:46:02,494
Scott: So I think they should get rid of that and force you to have the shitty decks that you have to Optimize more.

726
00:46:02,795 --> 00:46:04,281
Rym: so my impression of this game.

727
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:05,244
Rym: I'm a castle of burgundy.

728
00:46:05,324 --> 00:46:07,676
Rym: I would say if you're a board gamer at all Just buy it.

729
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:08,785
Rym: Yeah, it's fine.

730
00:46:08,886 --> 00:46:09,228
Rym: It's fun.

731
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:19,050
Rym: My impression of core worlds is that I would not recommend you buy it unless you really Really really fucking like ascension, but you want another game.

732
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:27,365
Scott: That's like ascension because you just want to have every deck building game in the world Like you're a deck building nut and you're a little bored of Dominion expansions and things like that.

733
00:46:27,806 --> 00:46:35,278
Scott: then, you know core worlds You know, it's probably I think it's better than maybe Thunderstone which I played once Not really a fan of Thunderstone.

734
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:39,212
Scott: No, so it's probably like you know of the one deck building games I've played.

735
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:44,510
Scott: it's probably like, you know Dominion, you know, I guess there aren't really that many other ones Dominion's.

736
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,730
Rym: What about Tanto Kure?

737
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:52,250
Scott: I guess Tanto Kure is actually better than the other non-dominions because it's so similar to Dominion.

738
00:46:52,551 --> 00:47:01,790
Rym: So my impression of core worlds is to not get it because and I'm gonna throw out that book We keep talking about the terms from it characteristics of games by Richard Garfield.

739
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,781
Rym: You really just fucking read it if you listen to GeekNights.

740
00:47:04,082 --> 00:47:05,369
Rym: because I'm gonna I'm replacing my.

741
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:11,570
Scott: We get to the point where every reader every list the listener has read it and yeah you saying that they'll be like Rym.

742
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,894
Scott: I read it already shut up already.

743
00:47:12,954 --> 00:47:15,121
Rym: Yeah, but I'm gonna keep using these terms.

744
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:20,410
Rym: this game has no Directional heuristics at all.

745
00:47:20,832 --> 00:47:25,330
Rym: There's no way to do better than playing your hand in the obvious optimal way.

746
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:31,856
Rym: You have so few actual decisions to make that if you discount the bad decisions You're basically playing perfectly.

747
00:47:31,876 --> 00:47:36,690
Rym: there were only way to do better is to have memorized the entire deck.

748
00:47:37,093 --> 00:47:48,089
Scott: There were some decisions to make however They didn't actually end up having to be made because I would be sitting there on most of my turns and the big decision was There are a bunch of cards in the table.

749
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:49,889
Scott: Which one do I want to take?

750
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:57,189
Scott: And you look and it's obvious which one is best for you the deck you have already started making Alright, and you say that one's the best card for me.

751
00:47:58,151 --> 00:47:59,497
Scott: Someone takes it or they don't.

752
00:47:59,558 --> 00:48:00,844
Scott: if no one takes it I took it.

753
00:48:01,286 --> 00:48:06,789
Scott: if someone else took it I look for the second best card for me and took that one and that was pretty much what I did all game.

754
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:11,788
Rym: So it was like ascension in the sense that every turn after that first card you get on the first turn.

755
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:16,710
Scott: you just keep getting Cards similar to that card for the rest of the game, and that's it now simultaneously?

756
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:17,692
Rym: There's.

757
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:37,533
Rym: no there's a lot of calculations you have to do while playing Because not only are there two different currencies and every card has both of them, which is fine But almost every card has some crazy different modifier on it like discard up to two cards from your hand each one of which gives you plus two to ground strength or Fleet strength.

758
00:48:37,774 --> 00:48:46,363
Rym: so to calculate what you could or could not do on your turn is Actually really time-consuming even if you are really good at that sort of.

759
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,390
Scott: that was my biggest problem with the game overall.

760
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,558
Scott: Is that Dominion or any other ones right?

761
00:48:50,578 --> 00:48:51,340
Scott: a deck building game?

762
00:48:51,601 --> 00:48:54,110
Scott: you have like ten cards to work with or remember what they?

763
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,782
Scott: Do maybe up to 20. they're all open.

764
00:48:56,823 --> 00:48:58,390
Scott: you can see all the possible cards.

765
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,856
Scott: You know what they all do in this one.

766
00:49:00,277 --> 00:49:01,823
Scott: every turn all these new cards appeared.

767
00:49:01,843 --> 00:49:03,510
Scott: you had to learn and they're all unique cards.

768
00:49:03,771 --> 00:49:24,525
Scott: so your deck is getting to ends up getting full of all these cards that are all different from each other and in front of You have all these cards that are all different from each other and you basically need to read every single card You've got every time you do something that involves all of them to sort of add them all together Because they're most of them are not just straightforward cards that you don't have to read.

769
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:36,530
Scott: so it's like every time I attacked I had To read every one of my planets to see if they modified the attack and every ship in the attack to see if it modified the attack and every tactics card in my hand to see if it could modify the attack and

770
00:49:37,476 --> 00:49:37,861
Rym: Turn.

771
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:40,536
Rym: you have a Second dual currencies.

772
00:49:40,576 --> 00:49:42,282
Rym: you have a currency of fleet and ground.

773
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:48,130
Rym: you have another currency of actions and energy But they're both basically limiting to the same degree.

774
00:49:48,712 --> 00:49:55,210
Rym: So the game is really unnecessarily complex because that complexity does not beget complex problem-solving abilities or no.

775
00:49:55,310 --> 00:50:02,047
Scott: It's just complex Computation busy work to do to figure out what your score if you have you can do what you want to do.

776
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:14,950
Rym: now the expansion Makes this worse by adding this whole meta where some cards have a symbol on them And then you're adding tokens to this other board of symbols And then there's victory points based on whether or not you have the most tokens on one of those.

777
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:18,410
Rym: But you can spend them for points or to get action.

778
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:22,210
Rym: It just it gets to the point to where there's almost no positional heuristic at all.

779
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:22,371
Rym: There's.

780
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:28,270
Scott: no the two positional heuristics you have how many how many victory points the other guy has showing on his table?

781
00:50:28,911 --> 00:50:31,150
Rym: No, I think it's simpler than how many tokens he has.

782
00:50:32,952 --> 00:50:33,997
Rym: Has the person taken?

783
00:50:34,017 --> 00:50:36,428
Rym: yeah, and how many tokens they have on that other?

784
00:50:36,448 --> 00:50:45,263
Scott: yeah The victory points on the planets ended up mattering a lot if I had a chance based on the turn order to get a planet that was worth six.

785
00:50:45,323 --> 00:50:51,261
Scott: instead I ended up with one that was worth three and That happened once or twice Simply based on turn order.

786
00:50:51,824 --> 00:50:57,890
Scott: I didn't get a planet I could have had if say the planets had come out differently or the turn order had been different.

787
00:50:58,011 --> 00:50:59,488
Scott: I would have had many more points.

788
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:04,161
Scott: So the victory points on the planets do matter not just the number of them.

789
00:51:04,904 --> 00:51:06,890
Rym: yep, so don't buy it.

790
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:07,770
Rym: It's actually not that good.

791
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:15,950
Scott: I would have to be pretty Thoroughly to be a super deck building fanboy who really loved and who maybe even gets off on the sci-fi space fighting theme.

792
00:51:16,252 --> 00:51:17,241
Scott: Yeah to get this one.

793
00:51:17,261 --> 00:51:18,170
Rym: It's there to play it again.

794
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:20,400
Rym: I would have to be pretty thoroughly convinced to do so.

795
00:51:20,722 --> 00:51:22,510
Rym: it also took a really long time.

796
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,099
Scott: It did take a long time compared.

797
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:24,722
Scott: You know Dominion.

798
00:51:24,742 --> 00:51:26,130
Scott: You can bust off a whole bunch of good look.

799
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:27,695
Rym: It's obvious why it took a long time.

800
00:51:28,277 --> 00:51:31,909
Rym: all the cards are effectively unique, and you have to read everyone over and over and over again.

801
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:40,172
Rym: There's a bunch of sidetracks and fiddly rules and the calculation time it takes to figure out even basic heuristics is Ludicrous.

802
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:42,222
Scott: yep all right, so the third game.

803
00:51:42,263 --> 00:51:48,570
Scott: We were talking about is Viva, Java, so we didn't even really play more than one turn of this game.

804
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:51,730
Scott: We played in zero games of this zero turns of it properly.

805
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:56,470
Rym: So this is just an impression based on a brief teaching and then an attempt to play two rounds.

806
00:51:56,712 --> 00:51:59,814
Scott: Yes, we screwed up a bunch of rules Big time.

807
00:51:59,954 --> 00:52:04,670
Rym: so my viva job is a guy like you bid on beans and you form correlate.

808
00:52:04,771 --> 00:52:07,164
Rym: I don't want to talk about the mechanics really because we'll talk about it again.

809
00:52:07,184 --> 00:52:08,190
Scott: It's been a game.

810
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,037
Scott: They had a lot of hype.

811
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:10,167
Scott: I've heard a lot about it.

812
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:20,570
Rym: my Team is that it's too fiddly and my rationale is thus The way the game is written at least the way the rules were described the way you play them.

813
00:52:21,152 --> 00:52:29,649
Rym: There's a lot of things that kind of could happen simultaneously and people seem to just play this game doing them simultaneously But it was me and Scott and dr.

814
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:41,070
Rym: Hazard and a bunch of other people in the front row crew are all pretty on these things so immediately Anytime something could be simultaneous the question was asked by someone wait wait wait.

815
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:42,937
Rym: What order does this happen in?

816
00:52:42,997 --> 00:52:45,446
Rym: because I'm changing my action based on what other people do.

817
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:46,369
Scott: exactly so?

818
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:51,009
Rym: This would be fine except that there's so many little things that happen.

819
00:52:51,492 --> 00:52:54,510
Rym: They and there's a giant and the game takes nine players granted.

820
00:52:54,752 --> 00:52:55,919
Scott: Well it can take.

821
00:52:56,221 --> 00:52:57,630
Scott: it can take up to eight players.

822
00:52:57,831 --> 00:53:02,463
Rym: I think it's sort of weird as recommended with five six seven or eight.

823
00:53:02,603 --> 00:53:14,342
Scott: right because when you look the cool part about the Game is this coalition forming aspect where you play every turn you play your guys somewhere in the world and wherever you play him in The world determines three things it determines.

824
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:15,770
Scott: actually determines four things.

825
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:18,537
Scott: Number one which bonus you're gonna get?

826
00:53:18,617 --> 00:53:20,983
Scott: each place is a different bonus or penalty.

827
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:23,870
Scott: number two you get a free bean wherever you go.

828
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,474
Scott: Determines what beans.

829
00:53:25,514 --> 00:53:28,162
Scott: beans beans beans determines what bean you're gonna get.

830
00:53:28,322 --> 00:53:36,406
Scott: number three if you roast it Determines what kind what variety you're going to roast on that turn which matters.

831
00:53:37,007 --> 00:53:43,465
Scott: and number four Anyone who goes in the same continent as you is going to be in the same coalition as you.

832
00:53:43,485 --> 00:53:47,436
Scott: there are three co three teams Basically that are formed each turn.

833
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:50,325
Scott: so you want to be on a team with the right people.

834
00:53:50,385 --> 00:53:56,145
Rym: right because then each turn each team Votes whether or not to do a or B, and then they play their turn right.

835
00:53:56,165 --> 00:53:59,115
Scott: so every turn every team You're on a different team of three people.

836
00:53:59,175 --> 00:54:02,768
Scott: that team is either going to brew or it is going to research.

837
00:54:03,209 --> 00:54:08,590
Scott: if it Researches you basically all just increase your powers right in a really not intuitive way.

838
00:54:08,651 --> 00:54:10,549
Rym: We had to clarify the rules on like ten times.

839
00:54:10,653 --> 00:54:18,861
Scott: Yes if it Reese if you brew you basically all create a Victory point coffee machine and you will all get those points.

840
00:54:18,981 --> 00:54:20,706
Scott: everyone on that team will get those points.

841
00:54:20,726 --> 00:54:23,818
Rym: the coffee machines are poker hands Of beans, but you draw randomly.

842
00:54:23,898 --> 00:54:26,350
Rym: so you have to play the odds, but it's an individual game.

843
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:32,070
Scott: So you have to think okay if I'm gonna brew do I want to brew with those people right?

844
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,534
Scott: It's like you know.

845
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:36,024
Scott: those people are you know below me.

846
00:54:36,044 --> 00:54:37,069
Scott: They're not gonna catch up.

847
00:54:37,089 --> 00:54:41,370
Scott: so yes I do want to brew with them because we'll all get the same number of points from that brew.

848
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:47,050
Scott: Thus I'll be hurting these people who are not on my team, but let's say I'm losing someone's ahead of me.

849
00:54:47,474 --> 00:54:48,609
Scott: Do I want to brew with them?

850
00:54:49,034 --> 00:54:53,830
Scott: No, I'd be helping them And I wouldn't really be catching up to them because we'd all be getting those points.

851
00:54:54,212 --> 00:55:03,130
Scott: But maybe then I could join their team and poison their brew Making it so they don't get as many victory points, but that will only help someone else catch up to them.

852
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:10,034
Scott: So what I really want to do is brew with someone else and have someone else poison their brew for me And you see where this goes.

853
00:55:10,476 --> 00:55:21,648
Rym: so there's a lot of cool mechanics in this game, but at least on an initial play And the game is recommended seven and eight players with eight players and turn order matters so much this will take forever.

854
00:55:21,809 --> 00:55:22,250
Rym: this game.

855
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,803
Rym: You're gonna have to cycle through eight players.

856
00:55:25,345 --> 00:55:26,069
Rym: I'm gonna do this.

857
00:55:26,149 --> 00:55:30,663
Rym: well I'm gonna do this in a loop like ten times per turn.

858
00:55:30,803 --> 00:55:33,070
Rym: yeah this game will take forever.

859
00:55:33,612 --> 00:55:44,070
Scott: So unless we read the rules way wrong their words like the voting is supposed to be simultaneous But then the action taking is like you know well who you know this team, okay?

860
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,558
Scott: So we all vote simultaneously.

861
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:47,468
Scott: every one of the whole table votes.

862
00:55:47,528 --> 00:55:47,870
Scott: research.

863
00:55:48,071 --> 00:55:49,014
Scott: Let's just say right.

864
00:55:49,355 --> 00:55:51,162
Scott: so who researches first?

865
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:53,270
Scott: in the turn order we research first.

866
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:55,099
Scott: So we do the turn order research.

867
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,105
Rym: that isn't clockwise.

868
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:57,170
Rym: you're jumping around the table.

869
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:01,115
Scott: You're jumping around the table checking the turn order Which is based on these colored chits.

870
00:56:01,135 --> 00:56:04,205
Rym: the turn order changes every round based on victory point.

871
00:56:04,265 --> 00:56:05,750
Scott: that was something that was a huge problem.

872
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,957
Scott: Was the victory point thing right?

873
00:56:08,037 --> 00:56:11,850
Scott: is early in the game at least it's victory points determine turn order.

874
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:19,856
Scott: You have to move the victory point tokens in the precise order because when there's a tie Let's say two people are tied for three.

875
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:26,791
Scott: whoever arrived at the three later goes first or Second.

876
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:27,955
Scott: right it matters.

877
00:56:28,276 --> 00:56:32,130
Scott: so you have to move the victory point tokens in the proper sequence.

878
00:56:32,271 --> 00:56:33,879
Scott: You can't just sort of be like okay.

879
00:56:33,919 --> 00:56:35,065
Scott: How many points did everyone get?

880
00:56:35,106 --> 00:56:36,575
Scott: I got two I got three I got four.

881
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,187
Scott: right you have to actually see.

882
00:56:38,268 --> 00:56:41,486
Scott: okay You move yours first because you just scored the point.

883
00:56:41,506 --> 00:56:42,089
Rym: so my worries.

884
00:56:42,129 --> 00:56:44,820
Rym: now You just have points a large amount of sort of.

885
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,150
Rym: it's not really mechanical busy work.

886
00:56:47,331 --> 00:56:49,218
Rym: It's just that the procedure.

887
00:56:49,479 --> 00:56:51,467
Scott: It's not busy work because you're not calculating.

888
00:56:51,547 --> 00:56:54,055
Scott: It's just procedural time.

889
00:56:54,116 --> 00:56:54,658
Rym: it's a you.

890
00:56:54,758 --> 00:57:11,089
Rym: it ends up having the same effect as busy work because You have to go through this procedure in such precise order that you can't ever just kind of do something and as a result You have to be constantly on the ball and aware of all right who just did this action.

891
00:57:11,169 --> 00:57:12,456
Rym: now Let's do the next action.

892
00:57:12,698 --> 00:57:14,890
Rym: you need like a person to run the clock tick of the game.

893
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:25,290
Scott: I think that if this was a computerized game It would actually be vastly superior because number one you would never fuck up something like the victory point tying anything, right?

894
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:26,816
Scott: So you wouldn't it if no one had to think about that.

895
00:57:27,338 --> 00:57:36,350
Scott: and number two all the things like drawing things Randomly out of the bag and peeking knowing, but be you know all that kind of stuff wouldn't be an issue, right?

896
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,281
Scott: It would all just sort of happen you know.

897
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:39,850
Scott: so it'd be like you want to draw being out of the bag.

898
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:43,583
Scott: Yes, poop this bean right you know do you know it would be?

899
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:49,009
Scott: it would solve a whole lot of problems Mostly with you know organizing the physical pieces and all that kind of stuff.

900
00:57:49,692 --> 00:58:03,149
Scott: so and then if you could play it on the computer like that the coalition making aspect which is the interesting unique mechanic of this game would emerge and Most of your thought would be going towards that every turn and it could be really fun.

901
00:58:03,932 --> 00:58:10,318
Rym: There are a lot of rules clarification questions on the geek many of which are not answered But I did it.

902
00:58:10,378 --> 00:58:13,150
Rym: yeah, there's a lot and one guy says it's primarily a social game.

903
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,953
Rym: That's why he likes it.

904
00:58:14,615 --> 00:58:18,510
Scott: It is very social with the bean sharing and the teaming up except

905
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:22,250
Rym: No, it's not because look at who was playing that is a purely mathematical game

906
00:58:22,611 --> 00:58:29,190
Scott: It's so I could see how it's social if the P if not everyone is super serious right because you're brewing together

907
00:58:30,112 --> 00:58:30,896
Rym: Is

908
00:58:30,937 --> 00:58:33,470
Scott: a game where you cannot score victory points alone.

909
00:58:33,631 --> 00:58:34,474
Scott: It is impossible.

910
00:58:34,996 --> 00:58:38,750
Scott: you must join a team every turn of people and do something.

911
00:58:39,052 --> 00:58:44,017
Rym: It is a game where I worry that playing to win will make the game Interminable and unbearable.

912
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:46,406
Rym: possibly now we have to play it again to be sure.

913
00:58:46,446 --> 00:58:47,530
Rym: so we are going to play it again.

914
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:47,871
Rym: I do.

915
00:58:47,971 --> 00:58:54,570
Scott: I do want to play it again unlike core worlds only for like I said that team making mechanic.

916
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:57,881
Scott: Yep, just cuz I want to see that go in another worries.

917
00:58:57,921 --> 00:59:07,370
Rym: Just that that those that coalition for me is gonna be so Procedural that it's just gonna drain all the energy, but I can see how a similar mechanic might make other games awesome.

918
00:59:08,075 --> 00:59:10,249
Rym: Oh, yes, I agree on that point.

919
00:59:11,475 --> 00:59:11,836
Rym: All right.

920
00:59:12,097 --> 00:59:13,543
Rym: We'll see you guys in a couple weeks.

921
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:14,869
Rym: We start up GeekNights again.

922
00:59:22,902 --> 00:59:25,440
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

923
