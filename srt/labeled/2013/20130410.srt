00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,989
Rym: It's Wednesday, April 10th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:11,290
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,280
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,262
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, talking about Mocha Fest 2013.

5
00:00:19,262 --> 00:00:19,839
Scott: My face itches.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,398
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,059
Rym: Why, because you haven't shaved?

8
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:24,319
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,140
Rym: I don't know, my face never itches when I don't shave.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,079
Scott: Do your beard hairs get pointy, turn around and poke you?

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,740
Rym: No, they pretty much go straight out in a nice, thick, orderly fashion.

12
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:36,639
Rym: I can grow a riker in like two weeks.

13
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:37,700
Scott: Yeah, mine doesn't do that.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,180
Scott: Mine, they go out and then they turn around and then they poke backwards.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,320
Rym: Well, you know what you need to do?

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,098
Scott: They're all so pokey.

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,939
Scott: Are yours like soft and like, ah.

18
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:47,039
Rym: Well, mine are really thick.

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,260
Scott: Mine are like a Brillo pad.

20
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:50,059
Rym: Yeah, they are, but you know what?

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,080
Rym: Once I let them grow to be like a couple of millimeters long, then they're just hair.

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,020
Scott: No, mine are just their entire length and they turn around.

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,080
Rym: Now, Scott, I think what you need to do is what I used to do- Beard softening chemicals?

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,680
Rym: No, but when I had my really long mustache, you got to comb that shit every morning.

25
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,639
Rym: Like actually take a tiny comb and comb your beard.

26
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:11,579
Scott: That doesn't help because they don't move.

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,527
Rym: What do you mean?

28
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:13,019
Rym: they don't move?

29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,740
Scott: Like, you know, if you comb hair, like if you comb it to the left, it goes left.

30
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,879
Scott: If you comb it to the right, it goes right.

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,300
Rym: But Scott, if you comb the beard hair, what it does is it pulls up the little bits that are otherwise about to go all ingrown.

32
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:24,418
Scott: Yeah.

33
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:29,196
Scott: The thing is the ingrown bits, right, is not from coming out, turning around and going back in.

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,637
Scott: The ingrown bits is they try to get out and they don't penetrate the skin and they turn around.

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,920
Rym: Well, that's just bad genetics.

36
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:36,980
Rym: I'm glad that I come from superior stock.

37
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:40,900
Scott: The turning around and poking doesn't go back into my body, right?

38
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:42,540
Scott: It's like stabbing knives.

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,079
Scott: It just pokes and itches.

40
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:46,180
Scott: It continues to grow normally.

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,100
Rym: Are you sure the itching and poking is not some sort of, I don't know, face dandruff or something?

42
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:52,460
Scott: How would I have face dandruff?

43
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:52,856
Scott: I don't know.

44
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,780
Scott: Wouldn't there be white flakes coming off my face?

45
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:55,679
Rym: Could be really tiny.

46
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,299
Rym: I don't know.

47
00:01:56,902 --> 00:02:01,640
Scott: I've never had a beard that was itchy except- If I scratch my face, there aren't like white flakes falling all over.

48
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,339
Scott: It's not snowing.

49
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:02,660
Scott: All right.

50
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,180
Rym: So I guess you don't have beard dandruff.

51
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:05,020
Rym: Yeah.

52
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,060
Rym: I don't know if I've ever seen anyone with beard dandruff.

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,900
Scott: I just can't come up with-.

54
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:08,497
Scott: Is that even possible?

55
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:09,678
Rym: I guess so.

56
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:15,700
Rym: I've gotten dandruff in my eyebrows sometimes, usually after I'm sick for a while and haven't actually washed my face or hair.

57
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,318
Scott: I mean, one time a dandruff, when I had hair, fell into my eyebrow, but it didn't come from my eyebrow.

58
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,979
Rym: Got to be all the cells in blue on that shit.

59
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,280
Scott: I don't have to worry about that shit anymore.

60
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:27,916
Scott: Yeah.

61
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:32,100
Rym: I've seen bald dudes with dandruff, so it can happen.

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,520
Scott: Yeah.

63
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,015
Scott: That is fucked up.

64
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:35,040
Rym: That's just really, really sad.

65
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,477
Scott: That means you didn't wash your head.

66
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,000
Rym: Anyway, because this is an awesome conversation.

67
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:46,652
Rym: So Emily and I, over the weekend, went to see Up on Poppy Hill, which is Goro's new movie.

68
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,040
Rym: You all remember Goro from- Mortal Kombat 2?

69
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,280
Rym: Mortal Kombat 1?

70
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,600
Rym: From making really good tournaments.

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,838
Scott: The guy with four arms.

72
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,098
Rym: Four arms.

73
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:56,997
Scott: Yeah.

74
00:02:57,621 --> 00:02:59,299
Rym: So no, we went to see Up on Poppy Hill at the IFC.

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,959
Scott: Also, he has four forearms.

76
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:03,560
Rym: Which is my basically favorite place to go.

77
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:13,980
Rym: But Goro Miyazaki was famous among anime fans in the US and in many other places up until recently for having failed to live up to the legacy of his father.

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,340
Scott: Everyone knows, including Genghis Khan, supposedly, that meritocracy is good and nepotism is bad.

79
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:21,096
Rym: Yep.

80
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,276
Rym: Now, well, it depends because pure nepotism is bad because you're just hiring someone that you know.

81
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:34,640
Rym: But if you pull from the people you know, and the people you know happen to be experts who you now also know you can trust, then nepotism is good.

82
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:43,380
Rym: Well, I mean, there are- It's bad when you hire crazy Uncle Louie to be on your board of directors solely because he's your Uncle Louie, irrespective of crazy.

83
00:03:43,860 --> 00:04:05,360
Scott: There are a few cases, especially if you look at something like baseball or other professional sports of so-and-so's son, right, so-and-so is a famous athlete and so-and-so's son either, you know, also tried to go for it but didn't do as well or tried- like I think David Robinson's son is playing college basketball, but I don't think he plays as well as his dad did, right?

84
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,466
Scott: But there are other cases where, you know, some descendant is better than the original, right?

85
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,720
Scott: And there's some cases where you have like siblings, like Manning Bros or whatever.

86
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:20,620
Scott: So you know, nepotism doesn't mean there's, you know, there's no merit.

87
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,360
Scott: There could be merit combined.

88
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:35,960
Rym: Anyway, my whole point is that Goro kind of took on a directorial debut with Legend of Earthsea that was- or Tales of Earthsea, that was just really poorly done.

89
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,179
Scott: Well, it could be the curse of Earthsea in that no adaptation of Earthsea has ever been good ever or ever will be.

90
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,240
Scott: It could be, but in this case- Other than the original book, which you should have read because book club.

91
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,956
Rym: This was sad partly because with his Earthsea, it was beautiful and well animated and it could have been great- Yeah, because he wasn't drawing it.

92
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:58,055
Scott: But it- I mean, if I'd made a movie and Studio Ghibli animated it, it would be beautiful.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,200
Rym: It's like you took a bunch of random aspects from different Ursula K. Le Guin stories and just mashed them all together into an interminable movie.

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,560
Scott: Yeah, I would have written a direct and trans interpretation.

95
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,237
Rym: Exactly.

96
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,520
Scott: But anyway- And it would have been just as beautiful.

97
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,980
Rym: Goro's more recent movie, which the screenplay was by Hayao Miyazaki and someone else.

98
00:05:20,543 --> 00:05:23,759
Rym: And basically Goro's dad had a bigger role in this.

99
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:25,859
Scott: I think he was- So how much work did Goro even do?

100
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,159
Rym: Goro did direct it.

101
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,740
Rym: I think his father supervised- What does that even mean?

102
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,500
Rym: And worked on the screenplay.

103
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,419
Scott: What does that even mean?

104
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:32,619
Rym: Well, it means he directed.

105
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:33,157
Scott: Yeah.

106
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,800
Scott: Which, what exact responsibilities did he have?

107
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,980
Scott: Maybe they just let him stand there and do it and put his name on it, but actually did everything ignoring him.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,771
Rym: I'm pretty sure, just my guess would be.

109
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:56,920
Rym: what happened was he was still the director and got to make all the directorial calls, but the team of people that his father and him had around him were sort of pointing him in the right direction when he was about to do something dumb.

110
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,936
Rym: It'd be like, "Eh, maybe you should really just focus on the movie part and not add another random story to your already existing

111
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:05,499
Rym: screenplay.".

112
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:06,163
Rym: I'll bet.

113
00:06:06,203 --> 00:06:08,172
Rym: if anything, they just made him stick to the screenplay.

114
00:06:08,212 --> 00:06:10,354
Rym: that was already a good story.

115
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:11,058
Rym: Probably.

116
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:17,960
Rym: But it's the story of a girl who, her dad's dead and she lives in a boarding house taking care of her- It's up on Poppy Hill.

117
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:20,400
Scott: The hill has poppy plants?

118
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:21,138
Rym: No.

119
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,199
Scott: They just call it that.

120
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,260
Rym: But more importantly, it is also about the students at the school- Who are high on opium all the time?

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,800
Rym: In the '60s, Japan in the '60s, who have their awesome clubhouse that's going to be torn down because it's a shithole and they want to protect them.

122
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,400
Scott: Because they got to expand the poppy fields for more opium?

123
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,860
Rym: So the movie's got this great- There's no poppies.

124
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:59,098
Rym: So the movie's got this great sort of dual parallel story of girl whose dad is dead puts these signal flags up every day and someone's responding to him romance, coupled with the camaraderie, urusayet surah, band of idiots humor of a bunch of guys in their shithole clubhouse.

125
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,500
Scott: Which is all a cover up for opium drug smuggling.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,040
Rym: That kind of story is so uniquely Japanese, there's this certain- Scott and I always call it the camaraderie comedy.

127
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,380
Scott: Opium's pretty popular out in the Asia area.

128
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,280
Rym: Are you going to keep this up?

129
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:14,160
Rym: Usually, you're the one who gives me shit about taking a joke too far.

130
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,620
Rym: But you see, Scott, you see what you're doing here.

131
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,459
Scott: Am I bothering you?

132
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,559
Rym: You're not bothering me at all.

133
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,499
Scott: No, then I'll keep it up until I am.

134
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,180
Rym: See, it actually doesn't bother me, but I worry that it's going to bother you.

135
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:25,460
Scott: That's okay.

136
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,340
Scott: I'm not bothered by these stupid opium jokes.

137
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,259
Rym: Anyway, so you know urusayet surah?

138
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:38,640
Rym: There's the band of idiots with their capering and their shenanigans, the band of idiots in Captain Tyler, the band of idiots in Ranma, the band of idiots in Tank Police.

139
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:54,700
Rym: They're not always idiots, but whenever there's this certain kind of a group of people in an anime who exhibit this certain type of camaraderie that is so deeply in my wheelhouse and that is extremely present from up on Poppy Hill.

140
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,658
Scott: That is a good thing.

141
00:07:56,282 --> 00:07:57,980
Rym: I highly recommend this movie.

142
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:00,000
Rym: I enjoyed it very thoroughly.

143
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,620
Rym: I don't want to say much more about it because it's an anime movie.

144
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:05,720
Rym: It's not a sequel to anything.

145
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:08,660
Rym: It's not a standalone One Piece movie.

146
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,445
Rym: It's a good anime movie.

147
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,340
Rym: and actually the dub, super well done.

148
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,040
Scott: Oh, you saw a dub?

149
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:19,540
Rym: I saw a dub in the theater and the dub is excellent with one exception.

150
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,440
Scott: There's one character who's just annoying?

151
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:21,572
Scott: Nope.

152
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,840
Rym: The opening scene has a narration that's only present in the dub, which seems to be a trend in every dub ever.

153
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,980
Rym: All the Americans will not understand.

154
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,659
Rym: Let's add exposition and talking to the beginning of the movie.

155
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:36,980
Scott: So is there going to be a sequel up on Blueberry Hill?

156
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,918
Rym: I was up on Blueberry Hill the other day.

157
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:40,580
Scott: Were you?

158
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,878
Rym: In fact, I heard the whole school was.

159
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,780
Scott: There's apparently a whole school on Poppy Hill also.

160
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,880
Rym: From up on Poppy Hill.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,440
Rym: It's great.

162
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,315
Rym: You'll love it.

163
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:52,319
Rym: And if Scott watches it, we can do a real review of it.

164
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:53,700
Scott: All right.

165
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,739
Scott: So of course the big comic news this week, which shows how smart and ahead of the curve we are and awesome we are.

166
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:11,720
Rym: Well, this news story, the thing is, as of Dateline right now, has already gone through its full course from beginning to end, complete resolution, just in time for our show.

167
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,020
Scott: All right.

168
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,416
Scott: Exactly.

169
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,394
Scott: Here's the deal.

170
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:15,119
Scott: Story the first.

171
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,700
Scott: People don't realize this, right?

172
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:25,078
Scott: But Apple, when you submit things to the bookstore, the movies, the music, the iTunes, the app store, right?

173
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:29,880
Scott: They let you submit pretty much anything and you can mark things as 17 plus or not.

174
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,360
Scott: But the app store, right?

175
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,060
Scott: Apple does not consider apps to be art, really.

176
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:48,040
Scott: Now one, we take issue and umbrage with that, but so if you write a book and the book is say Lolita or something, right, that you can sell that in the iBook store right to 17 plus or whatever.

177
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:48,638
Scott: Right.

178
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:56,936
Scott: However, if you make an app like a Lolita app or something, or some people have made games that had like political messages, right?

179
00:09:57,701 --> 00:10:02,139
Scott: Like I can write a political book like why you should only vote for Scott and put that in the bookstore.

180
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,219
Scott: And they're okay with that.

181
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,079
Rym: I've got Johnson.

182
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:11,500
Scott: But if I made a vote for Scott app, they do not allow political apps now.

183
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:14,820
Scott: They do not allow freedom of speech and expression in the app store.

184
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,940
Scott: They do not consider software to be art.

185
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:24,480
Rym: Now I would understand if the apps were curated separately for the purpose of preventing malware and shady shenanigans.

186
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,519
Scott: They do that as well.

187
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:34,099
Rym: But the fact that they do it for content reasons is arbitrary, possibly, you know, it's basically malicious and anti free speech.

188
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:35,260
Rym: They're a corporation.

189
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,180
Rym: They're under no obligation to provide free speech or not censor.

190
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:39,680
Rym: But you know what?

191
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,397
Scott: Fuck them.

192
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,520
Scott: So, uh, there have been cases that you can look them up of various video games getting kicked out of the app store.

193
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,260
Scott: They're privileged legitimate games, but had something to say.

194
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:56,059
Scott: I think there was like a game about Starville slave labor or something like that, you know, and they got it kicked out.

195
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:22,580
Scott: So earlier, maybe a week or two ago, I'm not sure what day the French publisher, right, had some sort of comic app and they had to remove a significant portion of their library of, you know, French comics from their app, because, of course, they a lot of them have boobies and shit in them.

196
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:33,240
Scott: And, you know, Apple didn't tell them specifically which ones were no good or had it, you know, so they removed any one of them that had like even a boob in them just to make sure that they didn't get everything kicked out.

197
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:42,420
Scott: So a lot of, you know, incredibly a plus all time great works of French comic re are now not available in the app store anymore.

198
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,979
Scott: So fast forward a few days.

199
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:51,671
Scott: Story number two, comics ology, which is pretty much the comic app, right, that I don't use because DRM.

200
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,319
Scott: And why would I pay that much money when I can pay even less money by preordering discount comics made of paper?

201
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,037
Scott: They had an issue where Image Comics was like, you know, they tried.

202
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:09,740
Scott: they wanted to put Saga issue number 12 in the store.

203
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,920
Scott: But Saga issue number 12 has a boob in it now.

204
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,080
Scott: There are or so and risk supposedly there might be gay sex in it.

205
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,140
Scott: I don't even know what's in it because I've only read trade.

206
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,280
Scott: Number one is the issue.

207
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,660
Rym: There are sexy scenes in other of the issues that were fine.

208
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:32,660
Rym: And this one, which ostensibly was banned from the app store, and we say ostensibly because the story has come to its bigger conclusion and we now know exactly what happened.

209
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,400
Rym: The sexy times are homosexual.

210
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:37,620
Rym: And that was clearly the reason this was banned.

211
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:44,675
Rym: Now, if that were true, my disappointment with Apple would have been a thousand fold greater than it already is.

212
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:54,560
Scott: So, however, you could still go to the Comixology website, buy the comic there and then sync it to the Comixology app on the iPhone.

213
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,729
Scott: You just couldn't buy it through an in-app purchase on the iPhone itself in the Comixology app.

214
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,300
Scott: Right.

215
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:11,600
Scott: So, of course, this caused a huge uproar and side benefit, huge Streisand effect for Saga, which is the best, as we've told you, if you listen to our episode about it.

216
00:13:11,863 --> 00:13:12,860
Scott: And yeah, we're awesome.

217
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:14,279
Scott: And we knew about it before you did.

218
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,545
Scott: If you just discovered it.

219
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:26,399
Scott: because of this, you know, fiasco, there was a news today that said, oh, shit, guys, we actually just didn't put Saga in the store because we were.

220
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,120
Scott: we thought it broke the rules.

221
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,080
Rym: But what I can tell is because Apple told us it didn't.

222
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,478
Scott: So now we're going to put it in there.

223
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:41,280
Rym: So basically we got to see the Internet rage machine go from zero to full rage back to.

224
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:46,080
Rym: Yeah, there was nothing to rage about in the first place in the span of a couple of days.

225
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,539
Scott: The question is now image.

226
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:48,162
Scott: Right.

227
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:54,500
Scott: Were you a really smart and Streisand effecting backwards on purpose, which we suggested was a perfectly valid strategy.

228
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,263
Rym: Not two days.

229
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:58,180
Scott: That has not been used nearly often enough by anybody.

230
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,000
Rym: Yeah, guys, uh, Gignites is banned from Otakon.

231
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,495
Scott: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:09,000
Scott: But anyway, B, were they just telling the truth now?

233
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:16,880
Scott: C, maybe because of the fiasco, maybe that actually Apple talked to them and Jane, I don't know what Apple's not going to change.

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,380
Rym: Yeah, like the real issue here, there's two simple issues.

235
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:20,721
Rym: Why?

236
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:23,280
Scott: And D, let's say what they're saying is true.

237
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:27,660
Scott: Why did it take them this fucking long and this much fiasco to fucking fix it?

238
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:32,400
Rym: So the thing is, Apple was basically not involved in that process.

239
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Rym: The process of the rage machine was Brian K. Vaughn says something and people freak out and people respond to it because it looked like a duck and quack like a duck and smelled like a duck.

240
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,400
Rym: And it turned out it really wasn't a duck, but there is a duck.

241
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,880
Rym: The duck is just one order removed from the specific issue that everyone's raging about.

242
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:59,040
Rym: Most people I've seen on the Internet are not raging about the ideological stance that apps and games should be just as free of speech as movies.

243
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:05,620
Rym: They're railing against the specific homosexual sex thing being banned in saga, which wasn't actually true.

244
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,300
Scott: OK, now let's take this a step further to get interesting in the GeekNights' way.

245
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,863
Rym: Oh, which way?

246
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:12,880
Rym: Because there's there's a second stream of Internet rage.

247
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:22,220
Rym: OK, so let's say that everyone was only talking about Brian K. Vaughn and all the people originally reporting on this did not mention Fiona Staples.

248
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:26,760
Rym: And there is a huge Tumblr outrage at the lack of credit.

249
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,199
Scott: No, whatever that happens all the time.

250
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:36,519
Scott: Anyway, the real issue here is let's say we were to take Apple to court and say, they have a monopoly on this thing.

251
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:43,580
Rym: And they're, you know, well, the answer could be, well, Google also has an app store for their share, share, share.

252
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:51,900
Scott: But let's say, you know, I was able to sue Apple and being like, hey, you know, freedom of speech, they're blocking me because of discrimination or something like that.

253
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,181
Scott: All right.

254
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:58,100
Scott: I can make some sort of free speech discrimination argument to force Apple to allow my free speech app in the app store.

255
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,401
Scott: Right.

256
00:15:58,461 --> 00:15:58,742
Scott: Right.

257
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:05,062
Scott: Could I argue that my malware virus app is some sort of free speech?

258
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:10,080
Scott: So I anticipated this under the same mechanism to get that in the app store.

259
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:21,584
Scott: And we do have a direct analogy in more traditional media, because if you can copyright software, right, we use copyrights for software, then they are artworks, are they not?

260
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:25,020
Scott: And if they are works, then they are speech.

261
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:28,900
Scott: And that means if I copyright a virus, it is now free speech.

262
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,502
Scott: I should be able to.

263
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:40,226
Rym: So you may remember the Innocence of Muslims movie made famous on the Internet for causing riots and basically being a horrible thing in pretty much every way.

264
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,199
Scott: So there's free speech.

265
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,065
Rym: There's a moment.

266
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,580
Rym: I'm saying there's an analog here.

267
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:52,660
Rym: There is a similar work of art, a similar is a work of art, a more traditional work of art than code, because movies have been around longer.

268
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:53,987
Scott: Yeah.

269
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,173
Rym: And it has.

270
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:56,560
Scott: that's questionable, right?

271
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,413
Scott: I mean, movies are from what the early 20th century, right?

272
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:07,460
Scott: Whereas Babbage was from earlier than that to Babbage have math, Isaac Newton older.

273
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:09,638
Rym: So you're going to say you're going to say that code is just math.

274
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,542
Rym: You're going to.

275
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:14,939
Rym: you're going to go all reducto to the beginning of saying there were algorithms before there were movies.

276
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:18,960
Scott: Yes, there were transistors, though, anyway, or vacuum.

277
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,694
Rym: So you've got an analogous situation of there's a work of art that could.

278
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:26,630
Rym: it is likely to end up causing harm.

279
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,440
Rym: that is physical, that would not otherwise have happened in that instance, yet is protected.

280
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,121
Rym: Free speech.

281
00:17:33,064 --> 00:17:44,300
Rym: Malware is actually one step worse because it directly causes the first order harm as opposed to simply instilling the second order harm.

282
00:17:45,762 --> 00:17:52,219
Rym: So the movie enrages the person who then freaks out and hurt someone as opposed to the malware, which directly hurts them.

283
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:57,622
Rym: But how about what if I made a movie that caused epileptic seizures and started showing it to people?

284
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:06,724
Scott: What if right instead of distributing the malware where you download it and it malwares you right, you download the malware and now you can use the malware on someone.

285
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:08,439
Scott: It downloads it like that.

286
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,123
Scott: The say you could.

287
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:16,840
Scott: then that would be no different than, say, a CD-ROM, which could be used for pirating, but is not necessarily needs to be used for pirating.

288
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:22,939
Rym: Now, at the same time, I think there is an easy, easy way around this.

289
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:23,742
Scott: All right.

290
00:18:23,922 --> 00:18:30,160
Rym: One, stores generally will not sell things that are dangerous and harmful.

291
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,644
Rym: And we have laws about regulating that, like you can buy tack hammers and chainsaws and all sorts of shit.

292
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:37,540
Rym: But you can't buy lawn darts, for example.

293
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,186
Rym: No, you can't.

294
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:42,862
Rym: And you would probably get in trouble if your toy store were selling tack hammers.

295
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:46,460
Scott: Yeah, you would unless it was a toy and Home Depot.

296
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:58,988
Rym: But at the same time, like a Walmart Walmart sells toys and at the same time, if I buy a hammer, it is documented and it says if you hit something with this and it is loaded, there will be a tack in it.

297
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:00,600
Rym: It is designed to put text and things.

298
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:16,027
Rym: So if I purchase or download an app that openly without any confusion tells me it is malware, tells me what bad things it's going to do, then that is the same as giving someone a tack hammer.

299
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,900
Rym: You can hurt yourself with it if you want.

300
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,743
Scott: I'm going to make.

301
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:22,610
Scott: I'm going to make a malware, make a website and then on the website say this is malware.

302
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,397
Scott: Please download it.

303
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:25,288
Rym: Yes, let's do it.

304
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:26,400
Rym: This will be our arts.

305
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:29,120
Rym: This will be our installation if you put it in a museum.

306
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,482
Rym: Right.

307
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,498
Scott: This is actually a great idea.

308
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,660
Rym: It's got a spot where you can put a USB stick in it.

309
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,963
Rym: If you put a USB stick in it, it affects the USB stick with malware that will destroy your computer.

310
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:41,062
Rym: If you ever put it in the computer, you do it and it has an ethernet port.

311
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:43,680
Rym: If you plug a computer into it, it fucks the computer anyway.

312
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:55,544
Rym: So if I sell you a tack hammer, but if you hit the wall, it actually shoots text into your hand through the handle, that is the analogy of malware that does something it didn't.

313
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:56,679
Rym: it wasn't supposed to.

314
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,503
Scott: I'm talking about you.

315
00:19:57,543 --> 00:20:03,379
Scott: go to the app store, you download this app and then the app allows you to malware others, not yourself.

316
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,340
Rym: So it's well, how is it going to malware others?

317
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:09,220
Rym: That's the same as doing like a DDoS or something.

318
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:13,640
Scott: It's it's a weaponized piece of software for attacking other iPhones or something.

319
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,081
Scott: I don't know.

320
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:19,703
Rym: So pragmatically, the way I would see this theoretically, yeah, I'm saying pragmatic.

321
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:22,639
Scott: I don't know how it would actually work if I were curating a store like this.

322
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:39,179
Rym: Apple should completely segregate ideological and speech questions from functional questions, because while you could make an argument that there is no difference pragmatically, there is actually a pretty distinct difference, especially in this case.

323
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:53,545
Rym: And it is obvious that Apple is discriminating on the content irrespective of the functionality only in this one area, yet clearly is respecting free speech in all these other areas.

324
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:56,100
Rym: So they're treating different mediums very differently.

325
00:20:56,962 --> 00:21:01,796
Rym: And there's no reasonable justification for that because malware is not.

326
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:02,920
Rym: it's in courts.

327
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,297
Rym: Oftentimes you'll see the arguments of this is what the law says it should be used for and what it is used for.

328
00:21:09,324 --> 00:21:11,099
Rym: Here is the history of the law's use.

329
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:14,700
Rym: Is this consistent with its intent that can be considered by judges?

330
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:21,220
Scott: What it's really used for is Apple just wants their cut and they want you to put your comics in the iBook store and not in comics.

331
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:22,062
Scott: Exactly.

332
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:26,101
Scott: The thing is, they get less cut, I think, when the in-app purchase than from a book.

333
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:26,542
Scott: I don't know what

334
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:44,781
Rym: I can think of no legitimate defense of Apple's policies on content in the app store separate from its policies on content in other areas where you can get content through them simply because of what I just said, because of the fact that they're discriminating both functionally and on the nonfunctional content of the work itself.

335
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:58,720
Rym: So things of the day, I mentioned it a couple of times, but I was kind of reminded recently that the brave little toaster exists.

336
00:21:59,141 --> 00:21:59,546
Rym: I don't want to get.

337
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,619
Scott: everyone knows it exists.

338
00:22:01,742 --> 00:22:04,900
Rym: Our friend Jess at our burning wheel game last night did not know that it existed.

339
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:05,984
Scott: What the fuck?

340
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:07,960
Rym: A lot of people have never heard of this movie.

341
00:22:08,581 --> 00:22:10,911
Rym: Now, at some point, I think we want to.

342
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:16,500
Rym: I want to watch it again, do a show on it, because there's there are a lot of interesting things to say about this movie.

343
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:18,960
Scott: The people involved appliances go on an adventure.

344
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:23,559
Rym: A lot of the team that ended up being Pixar was on this movie way back.

345
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:28,160
Rym: And the movie is surprisingly dark and creepy.

346
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,128
Rym: And there's.

347
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:32,079
Rym: it's a pretty amazing movie for what it is.

348
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:39,620
Rym: So what I've linked to my thing of the day, just to give you a sense of this movie, is actually two short videos, clips from this movie.

349
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:50,459
Rym: The first clip is one of these songs from the movie called Worthless, which you look around on the Internet, you'll find a lot of people talking about how this traumatized the ever living shit out of them as kids.

350
00:22:51,760 --> 00:23:08,702
Rym: The premise of the brave little toaster is that all electronic devices of any kind have sentience and can die and simultaneously they are still just appliances that are used and discarded.

351
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:18,302
Rym: So this is a junkyard and it's a bunch of cars singing about their lives and how they don't want to die, but how they're going to die now because they're worthless.

352
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:22,860
Rym: And then one by one, they're all actually being killed by the crusher robot.

353
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:29,840
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty brutal for a little kid to watch, but also cool in this sort of dark.

354
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:33,440
Rym: Maybe kids do need to be exposed to these ideas in an earlier age way.

355
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,798
Scott: And what lesson do you learn from this?

356
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,744
Rym: You know, you learn from this.

357
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:38,480
Rym: You're going to die worthless and alone.

358
00:23:38,781 --> 00:23:39,634
Rym: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

359
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:47,380
Scott: So the second video, I'm like, don't be the last of your friends to die because then your final days will be very, very lonely.

360
00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:57,600
Rym: Also, be the protagonist, because while your friend, the air conditioner, will flip out and die of an aneurysm because he knows the master's never coming back, the rest of you will probably survive.

361
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,520
Scott: What other infamous piece of pop piece of culture teaches the same lesson?

362
00:24:04,262 --> 00:24:07,719
Rym: I don't know if you're going to reference something specific, Godfather, part three.

363
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,340
Rym: Actually, that scene of his death is a pretty good scene.

364
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,259
Scott: It's the same shit.

365
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,600
Rym: It's so anticlimactic.

366
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,458
Rym: He's like, oh, anyway, spoilers.

367
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:19,639
Rym: He doesn't make it in the end.

368
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:20,462
Rym: No.

369
00:24:22,065 --> 00:24:22,399
Scott: All right.

370
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:23,339
Scott: My thing of the day.

371
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:23,776
Rym: No, no, no.

372
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:35,398
Rym: So my second video, there is a scene where the brave little toaster himself has a dream because he is terrified that he is going to accidentally kill the kid that likes him.

373
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:38,360
Scott: So it might be if he goes in the shower, then fuck.

374
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,714
Scott: Yeah, he is a bathtub.

375
00:24:40,763 --> 00:24:42,699
Rym: One of the most terrifying things in the world is clowns.

376
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:51,640
Rym: And this dream sequence involves this scene with a clown who picks up the toaster and throws it in the shower with the kid with forks and smoke.

377
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,239
Rym: And you'll have to watch it to believe it.

378
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,938
Rym: But I bring it up because the way it's presented is almost designed to scare little kids.

379
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,957
Rym: This huge, horrifying clown with a fire hose looms over the screen and whispers a single word.

380
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:11,079
Rym: It's a great scene.

381
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,197
Rym: Show this to your little cousins and freak them out.

382
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:13,980
Scott: Cousins.

383
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,540
Scott: OK, so there are pranks like this quite often on the Internet.

384
00:25:18,741 --> 00:25:19,578
Scott: They are nothing new.

385
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:26,080
Scott: But I want to show this one because, A, it is so, so well executed beyond others.

386
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:27,600
Scott: I have seen of this nature.

387
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:33,280
Scott: And B, it was so well executed already has one point one plus a million views.

388
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:35,719
Scott: So you should probably have seen this.

389
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,020
Scott: Otherwise, it's going to be one of those things where someone shows it to you.

390
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,720
Scott: And they'll be like, well, this is like three weeks ago.

391
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,680
Scott: How come you didn't see it already?

392
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,039
Scott: This is from like a few days ago.

393
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,120
Scott: So it was uploaded on April 5th, only five days late.

394
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,520
Scott: If you haven't seen it, it is human chair scare prank.

395
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,755
Scott: Dude dresses up as a chair so effectively.

396
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:53,699
Scott: people sit on him.

397
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:57,620
Scott: But you got to see this chair costume is so perfect.

398
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,485
Rym: Now, my worry is.

399
00:25:58,505 --> 00:26:00,520
Rym: Scott and I talked about this while we were watching the video.

400
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,240
Rym: All it would take is one fat man to turn this into a tragedy.

401
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:15,280
Scott: If you read the YouTube and find the dead body in the chair weeks later, if you read the YouTube comments, they talk about how like some of the pranks they did weren't on video or weren't good for the videos.

402
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,900
Scott: They didn't show them like there was somewhere like you would whisper in people's ears as they sat there to freak them out.

403
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,258
Scott: But you can't hear it on the video.

404
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,059
Scott: So they didn't put that in YouTube, stuff like that.

405
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,020
Rym: So he just whispers.

406
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,318
Scott: Yeah, you're sitting on me.

407
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:34,579
Scott: Why are you anyway, your grandma's still alive.

408
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,501
Scott: You should watch this because it's funny and the people take it pretty well, which is nice.

409
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:44,679
Rym: The only thing it doesn't have is I love these pranks, but still my favorite kind of prank is the one where the person doesn't realize they were pranked.

410
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:46,048
Scott: Good night.

411
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:47,180
Scott: Good night for flying.

412
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,501
Rym: Yeah.

413
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:51,240
Rym: Good night for flying or that epic fire prank that was so close.

414
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,099
Rym: But then they ruined it by revealing what happened at the end of the guy.

415
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,280
Rym: Yeah, I'll save that one for another thing of the day in the future.

416
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,642
Scott: Yeah.

417
00:26:58,983 --> 00:26:59,203
Rym: Yeah.

418
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:03,959
Rym: So book club book in the meta moment is the player of games.

419
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:05,700
Scott: I should actually start reading it again.

420
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,459
Scott: I read a bunch of chapters and then stopped it.

421
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,323
Scott: I haven't read it in weeks.

422
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:13,699
Rym: Well, we've we're actually back on track to be able to read that book now that we're past Pax.

423
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,723
Scott: Yep.

424
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:18,139
Rym: We have a couple of a few months before Pax and then Pax.

425
00:27:18,682 --> 00:27:18,965
Scott: Yes.

426
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:20,980
Rym: Anime Boston is in the mix somewhere in Connecticut.

427
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,265
Scott: We will do this book club before the next next.

428
00:27:28,817 --> 00:27:29,118
Scott: What?

429
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:31,630
Scott: Stop it, I guess, before in my Boston anyway.

430
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:33,964
Rym: So I'm not editing that.

431
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:34,750
Rym: pause out, captain.

432
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:35,211
Scott: Good.

433
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:40,913
Rym: So we're doing not one, not two, not three, not four, but five lectures at anime Boston.

434
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:44,314
Scott: We're doing it because if we don't fill the time at anime Boston with panels, I don't know what we're going to do.

435
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:47,835
Rym: besides we're doing how to review how to recommend anime.

436
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:49,449
Rym: We're doing how to run an anime club.

437
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:53,893
Rym: We're doing anime openers from around the world, which is identical to the last time I ran it.

438
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:55,610
Rym: So if you saw it before, don't see it again.

439
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,790
Rym: We are doing every anime is the same and we're doing judge anime by their covers.

440
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:01,391
Scott: Nice.

441
00:28:01,776 --> 00:28:02,990
Rym: This is going to be a fun time, actually.

442
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,109
Rym: Emily is also doing a panel.

443
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:14,150
Rym: Our friend Judith is also doing a panel where we're going to go all out at this anime Boston, because since we're banned at Otakon, we got to bust out the anime somewhere.

444
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,014
Scott: That's right.

445
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:16,870
Scott: I'm also feeling some anime lately.

446
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,449
Scott: I think I'm going to watch that Nichijou.

447
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:19,354
Scott: I downloaded it.

448
00:28:19,635 --> 00:28:23,253
Rym: If you ever seen an episode of Nichijou, I saw parts of episodes of Nichijou.

449
00:28:23,273 --> 00:28:24,610
Rym: Nichijou is pretty fucking great.

450
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,709
Rym: If you watch a bunch of it, we'll do a show on Nichijou.

451
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:37,790
Rym: Anyway, it's it's like take Asamanga Daioh and make it more fucked up, like a little Cromartie mixed in two full steps, more fucked up and one step more surreal.

452
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:41,150
Scott: I think it seems to me like an Asamanga plus a Cromartie.

453
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:44,210
Scott: Also, all the Cartoon Network shows are on Netflix.

454
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,990
Scott: So I'm watching a whole bunch of all those all over the place.

455
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,490
Scott: Some Samurai Jack, some Dexter's Lab, some Powerpuff Girls.

456
00:28:49,991 --> 00:28:52,990
Rym: I've been watching Archer and Adventure Time pretty much.

457
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,029
Scott: I even I watched like three Adventure Times.

458
00:28:56,975 --> 00:28:57,136
Rym: Yeah.

459
00:28:57,437 --> 00:29:01,150
Rym: Adventure Time gets better and better and kind of like Venture Brothers.

460
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:03,389
Scott: Some of them are better than others so far.

461
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:03,651
Scott: Right.

462
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:06,690
Scott: It's like the ones where the one with the weird heart.

463
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:07,738
Scott: That one wasn't so good.

464
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:09,070
Scott: The heart that came to life.

465
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,710
Rym: He comes back, though, and has a really good episode in like season three.

466
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,830
Scott: Yeah, that one is not so good.

467
00:29:13,572 --> 00:29:16,150
Scott: The ones where it's just like where they're adventuring with the elephant.

468
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:17,049
Scott: That one was good.

469
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,427
Rym: Yeah, I'll say this.

470
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,049
Rym: Every like season two of Adventure Time steps up the game in a huge way.

471
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:26,250
Rym: And season three steps up a bit beyond that.

472
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:33,830
Rym: And then season four, there's kind of this serious plotty thing between the end of season three and season four with alternate realities and stuff.

473
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,590
Rym: that's actually super good.

474
00:29:35,711 --> 00:29:44,124
Rym: And there's some serious episodes and some kind of interesting experimental episodes in the vein of the famous Dexter's Lab of Heh, heh, heh.

475
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,428
Rym: Heh, heh, heh, heh.

476
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:45,952
Scott: Mm hmm.

477
00:29:46,213 --> 00:29:49,670
Scott: Well, you know, obviously, I don't know every character in Adventure Time.

478
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,270
Rym: I love the fact that Adventure Time.

479
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,509
Scott: But the best character in Adventure Time so far.

480
00:29:54,231 --> 00:29:54,600
Scott: Ice King?

481
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:54,661
Scott: No.

482
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:55,494
Scott: Jake?

483
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,130
Scott: No, he sucks.

484
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,630
Rym: Have you met Marceline, the vampire queen?

485
00:29:58,281 --> 00:29:58,429
Scott: No.

486
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,809
Rym: She will be your favorite character.

487
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:04,409
Scott: The favorite right now is Lady Rainicorn, because ah shit, who doesn't want to be a Rainicorn?

488
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,750
Rym: She's pretty chill and cool.

489
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,192
Scott: Yeah.

490
00:30:06,394 --> 00:30:07,769
Rym: I like how she just talks in Korean.

491
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,770
Rym: They don't give you subtitles.

492
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:13,286
Rym: There's one episode where she talks for like a minute and they just don't tell you.

493
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:13,750
Scott: Yeah.

494
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:14,587
Rym: It's like whatevs.

495
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:17,429
Rym: You'll like Marceline because she's kind of bad.

496
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,745
Scott: Anyway, let's um.

497
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,650
Rym: It's been animation season lately.

498
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,910
Scott: Got any other meta action?

499
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:23,849
Rym: Uh, not too much.

500
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,130
Rym: I mean, we're going to be at Anime Boston.

501
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,250
Scott: You should, you know, we are Internet people.

502
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:33,230
Scott: If you use Internet's like Facebook's and Twitter's and websites and RSS's and podcasts, subscribings and forums.

503
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:34,569
Scott: We have all of those things.

504
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:35,428
Scott: Google pluses.

505
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:39,350
Scott: So whatever of those things you use, we even have an RSC channel.

506
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:42,870
Scott: You should go and connect with us using those things.

507
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,170
Rym: Oh, and because we're going to be, have a bunch more episodes coming up.

508
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:50,290
Rym: Now that we're back on track with our normal schedules, our show, gig nights presents.

509
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,528
Rym: Shoujo Kakame Utena is ongoing.

510
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,690
Rym: We are analyzing in depth as in sometimes our episodes are long.

511
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:59,050
Rym: We have YouTube to talk about.

512
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,639
Scott: We have YouTube's.

513
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:05,589
Rym: Every single episode of Utena one by one until the end of Utena.

514
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:07,590
Rym: It's a pretty good show.

515
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:08,889
Rym: I'm actually really proud of it.

516
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:12,670
Scott: And so go to front row crew dot com and you'll find all these things.

517
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,446
Rym: Yes, you will find all the front row crew dot com.

518
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:16,547
Scott: Oh shit.

519
00:31:16,754 --> 00:31:17,149
Scott: All right.

520
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:18,029
Scott: No one goes there.

521
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:18,509
Scott: All right.

522
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,590
Scott: So Mocha Fest Mocha Festival.

523
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,478
Scott: We've been to this thing.

524
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:22,389
Scott: how many fucking years?

525
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:25,070
Scott: Five, seven, eight.

526
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,550
Rym: I remember we used to take the train from Beacon down.

527
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:31,730
Scott: Yeah, we went to the puck building however many times.

528
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:33,510
Scott: And then we went to the armory.

529
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,250
Scott: We've been at every time it's been at the armory.

530
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,489
Scott: We've been there and we went to the puck building between two and four times.

531
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:49,210
Scott: So this Mocha Fest was a new experience because if you don't know, the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art, they this was their fundraiser for the year.

532
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,570
Scott: Basically, the the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art Arts Festival.

533
00:31:54,752 --> 00:32:01,110
Scott: And they even though they had this fundraiser every year that made a lot of money and was super successful, they didn't make enough money.

534
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:07,950
Scott: And they were getting to the point where they started to sell some of their great works in their museum to pay the bills, which was very sad.

535
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:15,430
Scott: So rather than do that too much, they sold themselves to the Society of Illustrators in the city, which has a lot more money.

536
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:24,230
Scott: So now it's totally rescued and now it is part of the Society of Illustrators and the Society of Illustrators has done a good job of making sure the festival still happened.

537
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:26,310
Scott: And the festival totally did still happen.

538
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:28,570
Scott: Very similar to how it has in previous years.

539
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,190
Scott: However, not identical, not identical.

540
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:32,630
Scott: They made some changes.

541
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:39,310
Rym: So first and foremost, there was a large, curated sort of museum collection in the back.

542
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:39,670
Rym: Yes.

543
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:49,150
Scott: It seems they took part of the Mocha itself and put it into the Mocha Arts Festival, an addition with a selection of the Mocha gift shop.

544
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:49,893
Scott: Right.

545
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:52,630
Scott: Also is in the back corner, which has never happened before.

546
00:32:53,191 --> 00:33:02,630
Scott: So to sort of, I guess, entice you to come to the Society of Illustrators and check out the Mocha stuff they have there and also sell you the stuff from their gift shop so they can make money.

547
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:04,492
Scott: That's OK.

548
00:33:04,653 --> 00:33:09,829
Scott: I'm happy to look at that stuff without having to actually go over to the Society of Illustrators where I don't really have too much time to go to.

549
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:23,090
Scott: Nothing wrong with that, except that took up some space in the armory and I didn't count the tables, but it felt like there were a little bit less tables, not like a lot less tables, not like, oh, my God, where did all the tables go?

550
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:26,710
Scott: Similar to PAX East, where it's like, is this smaller?

551
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:31,230
Scott: Did you get rid of, you know, were there less tables than last time?

552
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:39,650
Rym: At the same time, I wasn't super put out by that because the curated thing was actually pretty interesting to see a lot of those original drawings of like these old newspaper comics.

553
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,961
Scott: You know, I'm happy to have it there.

554
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:41,810
Scott: It was it was awesome.

555
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:47,890
Rym: But I think everything I saw back there, that Adam and Eve comic, did you actually read that comic that was up on display?

556
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:48,999
Scott: Yeah, I read that.

557
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,150
Rym: I really like that.

558
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:50,672
Scott: That's a good one.

559
00:33:50,692 --> 00:33:55,690
Rym: Because it was one of those very subtly well done, implied a lot, but didn't say it openly kind of comics.

560
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:57,069
Rym: And the style was cool.

561
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,813
Rym: Yeah.

562
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:10,210
Scott: But anyway, so, yeah, they replaced, I guess, at least a few tables of the previous year with this section to they put up, they basically raised the budget on the thing.

563
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,010
Scott: So there were like all these red curtains in between.

564
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:13,851
Rym: That was great.

565
00:34:13,871 --> 00:34:20,500
Scott: The tables, which was awesome, because number one, it made the whole place look more and feel more professional to.

566
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:27,070
Scott: it really reduced the noise because people talking in one aisle, the sound wouldn't really get to the next aisle so much.

567
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:33,496
Rym: Also, three, it reduced some of the clumping that used to happen, because in the old days, you'd walk in and you walk like.

568
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:43,228
Rym: I have some video I've uploaded, I think at some point, and you see everything and you see the big clumps of people and people are walking in who aren't us and go methodically tend to walk over to where the clumps of people are.

569
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:44,230
Rym: just makes everything worse.

570
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,029
Rym: Like you immediately see where the big popular things are and go check them out.

571
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:59,510
Rym: But with these dividers, instead, more people were doing the walk up and down every aisle, which reduced the localized crowding and I think caused the average attendee to see more of the interesting stuff at the show.

572
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,870
Scott: Yeah.

573
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:10,550
Scott: Our usual method was repeated where you walk up and down every aisle slowly and then you walk up and down every aisle somewhat less slowly buying all the things you saw the first time that you still feel like buying.

574
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:18,790
Rym: So the two differences that affected me, and this is just my perception, is one, I bought a lot less, probably the least I've ever bought at a mocha this year.

575
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:19,907
Scott: Me as well.

576
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:27,550
Rym: Now, part of that was because I saw a lot of the same tables who had a lot of the same comics that I've already bought.

577
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:32,424
Scott: But all of those same tables and same everythings have been.

578
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:34,190
Scott: we've been going to this thing how many years in a row.

579
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:36,290
Scott: So that's not really a change, right?

580
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:40,410
Scott: I mean, I've seen some people there every single year for the whole time I've been going.

581
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:51,650
Rym: Two, I feel like there is a. there were fewer of the across the board, these sort of very small, interesting one shot type of comics that I would usually buy.

582
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:56,470
Rym: Like fewer of those things caught my attention for some reason.

583
00:35:57,232 --> 00:36:00,370
Rym: I don't know if it was because the topics or the cover art was different.

584
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,110
Rym: Maybe there were less of them.

585
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:02,749
Rym: I can't tell.

586
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:14,130
Rym: All I know is I picked up, flipped through, bought or was caught attention by fewer and fewer of those little kinds of comics that I used to buy fistfuls of.

587
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,571
Scott: Yep.

588
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:25,010
Scott: Well, I did notice a lot of people seem to be doing a little bit more craftiness, a little bit more, you know, pins, stickers, buttons, things, and a little bit less.

589
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:28,310
Scott: Here is a full mini comic type of thing.

590
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,930
Scott: And that's really what I go there for is mini comics, right?

591
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:36,150
Scott: Is like I want, you know, some sort of whole comic or at least issue of comic.

592
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:36,932
Scott: Right.

593
00:36:36,972 --> 00:36:41,410
Scott: That is the kind of comic I can't just buy on Amazon or preorder for the comic store.

594
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,750
Rym: A lot of the tables were, which was it's not new.

595
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:51,130
Rym: It was always like this big publishers with their even though they're fairly independent or small press comics, there's still things I can just buy on Amazon or preorder.

596
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,210
Scott: Yeah, I did buy one book from Miriam.

597
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,570
Scott: I don't know how to pronounce her last name is just Catan.

598
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,949
Scott: I don't know, because she was just fucking right there.

599
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,150
Scott: And it's like, oh, well, I buy this and then you doodle it and then I take it.

600
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,050
Scott: And that is OK, even though that book I could buy on Amazon.

601
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:13,190
Rym: My other perception was that some of the weirder offerings were not there this year.

602
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:18,269
Rym: There's a lot of people I remember being there every year who are kind of weird or offbeat that I didn't see.

603
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:20,893
Scott: Hmm.

604
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:22,950
Scott: It could have been the reduction in tables.

605
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,070
Scott: I heard from someone the tables are four hundred dollars.

606
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,937
Scott: Don't know if that's true.

607
00:37:26,957 --> 00:37:28,410
Rym: It's not that bad.

608
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:32,150
Scott: It's not that bad, but that still pushes a lot of people out.

609
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,654
Scott: But even if it pushes people out, I saw a lot of.

610
00:37:34,674 --> 00:37:45,970
Scott: there were at least four or five tables that might as well have been like anime Boston artists, Ali tables with, you know, some cute anime peoples, usually girls selling, you know, cute anime.

611
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:51,410
Rym: There was a number of fan art, kind of anime con artist, Ali kinds of things there.

612
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:58,070
Rym: And maybe I'm contributing the problem, but I actually bought a print of this lemon grab from Adventure Time.

613
00:37:58,751 --> 00:37:59,435
Scott: I was had a problem.

614
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:02,010
Scott: I'm just saying they're there and I'm saying they're saying they're there.

615
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:03,630
Rym: Yeah, I bought something.

616
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:08,290
Scott: Yeah, I was almost buying something from them, too, because this stuff's cute.

617
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,830
Rym: But I did still get my old standbys.

618
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:19,050
Rym: I mean, there's no more poop comics, but I got like my second bunny mom because having rabbits, this girl just makes comics that are basically like this is what it's like to own a rabbit.

619
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:21,610
Rym: And they're very apt to what it's like to own a rabbit.

620
00:38:22,993 --> 00:38:24,430
Rym: And I got this little like good dog.

621
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,989
Rym: It's about a dog who's going to avenge his master's death.

622
00:38:28,132 --> 00:38:29,990
Rym: And it looks like it looks like a video game.

623
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:38,129
Rym: They said they want to make it a video game, but I don't know if they'll be able to because they don't know what kind of video game they want it to be, which is a sign that you're not ready to make video games.

624
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:39,217
Scott: Hmm.

625
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,849
Rym: But it's a really good little mini comic.

626
00:38:42,735 --> 00:38:42,795
Rym: Hmm.

627
00:38:42,896 --> 00:38:45,130
Rym: Emily picked up strong female protagonist.

628
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:49,209
Scott: It's like Kate Beaton, I thought didn't have a table there.

629
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:51,406
Rym: That's not Kate Beaton.

630
00:38:51,891 --> 00:38:54,250
Rym: That's Molly Ostertag and Brendan Lee Mulligan.

631
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:55,120
Scott: Uh huh.

632
00:38:55,424 --> 00:38:55,729
Scott: Strong.

633
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,250
Scott: It sounds strikingly familiar.

634
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,850
Rym: Yes, but no, this is strong female protagonist.

635
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:01,312
Scott: Oh, right.

636
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:03,210
Scott: I think Kate Beaton is strong female characters.

637
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,115
Rym: Something like that.

638
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,570
Scott: I forget anyway.

639
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:11,510
Rym: But I picked up stuff like that, but I bought maybe 10 or 11 comics total last year.

640
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,970
Scott: Not enough to cover the entire floor.

641
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:15,650
Rym: Now, last year we covered the entire living room floor.

642
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,544
Rym: I bought like 30 things.

643
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:23,050
Scott: Well, maybe part of our problem was that in years past, we had bought medium amounts sort of in between this year and last year.

644
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:28,027
Scott: And then last year we went so all out that this year so much repeats.

645
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:34,030
Scott: If we had bought less last year, then those things that we had not bought last year would have bought this.

646
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,070
Rym: My question is, why did we go so all out last year?

647
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:42,590
Rym: Because I remember last year we had that feeling, I guess you would come to me and be like, oh, my God, look at this thing I bought.

648
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,570
Scott: I'm like, yeah, it was the year with like the cute bunny in the basket.

649
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,730
Rym: They and I don't know.

650
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:56,690
Rym: Last year, I everyone I was with was coming up to me and I was going up to people saying, oh, my God, check out this thing I saw at this table over here, like dragging.

651
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:59,789
Rym: We were all dragging each other around this year.

652
00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:02,269
Rym: Almost no one did that to me.

653
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,368
Rym: And I did that to no one.

654
00:40:03,632 --> 00:40:04,849
Scott: Check out outside the window.

655
00:40:06,711 --> 00:40:07,930
Rym: Whoa, thunderstorms are coming.

656
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,019
Scott: I got to get home.

657
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:09,990
Rym: Scott, it's going to rain.

658
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,074
Scott: I told you that.

659
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:14,250
Rym: That's a pretty impressive thunderstorm.

660
00:40:14,551 --> 00:40:15,116
Scott: Yeah, right.

661
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:16,530
Rym: I get excited.

662
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,470
Rym: We don't get thunderstorms in New York often.

663
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,229
Scott: I know I got to go home and try to take lighting pictures and fail again.

664
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,310
Rym: So, yeah, MOCA was good.

665
00:40:23,997 --> 00:40:24,710
Rym: It was enjoyable.

666
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,250
Rym: It was.

667
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:32,750
Rym: I cannot articulate what made me slightly less satisfied this year because I can't point to anything specific.

668
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:35,270
Scott: Yeah, it was nothing that was obvious.

669
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:38,370
Scott: It was just like we saw the result and the cause is unknown.

670
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,110
Rym: Like I don't know why I bought less.

671
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:44,030
Rym: I don't know why I feel like I saw less things compared to what I usually see.

672
00:40:44,731 --> 00:40:50,229
Rym: I just I felt not dissatisfied, but almost dissatisfied, like a little more meh.

673
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:52,410
Rym: And I've never felt that way about a MOCA before.

674
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,750
Rym: But I, I cannot even begin to explain why.

675
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,083
Scott: Maybe you bought so much last year because he had that giant.

676
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:00,069
Scott: we love fine bag.

677
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:03,410
Scott: And it's an issue where, like when someone pours a drink, they fill the glass.

678
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:06,630
Rym: But then again, Emily bought a whole ton of crap.

679
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,849
Rym: And so did you last year because you were carrying all of it.

680
00:41:09,072 --> 00:41:10,229
Rym: I was not carrying that much.

681
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:14,890
Rym: I almost brought the we love fine bag, but I pulled it out and discovered it's torn after a parrot.

682
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,385
Rym: Yeah.

683
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:16,729
Scott: Oh, OK.

684
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,180
Scott: So let's just talk about cool things.

685
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,208
Scott: we did see at this MOCA.

686
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:24,250
Rym: That lemon grab stuff was actually pretty goddamn cool, especially because I don't know anything about this lemon grab.

687
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:28,705
Rym: Lemon grab in Adventure Time is one of the better things about that.

688
00:41:28,745 --> 00:41:29,870
Scott: storm is moving real fast.

689
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:32,072
Scott: Whoa.

690
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:37,710
Scott: OK, so I saw this cute comic called Pencil Pup, which was a cute puppy who had pencils for arms and legs.

691
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:41,290
Scott: And I bought it and I was just thinking it would be cute because I buy cute things.

692
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:47,670
Scott: And then when I got home and I actually read it, I was like, whoa, this shit is frickin surreal.

693
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,777
Scott: So if you go to www.

694
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,850
Scott: pencil pup dot com, it's a webcomic.

695
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:51,733
Scott: You can just read it.

696
00:41:51,834 --> 00:41:55,710
Scott: Even though I have the paper edition of the beginning, I got to the end and it wasn't over yet.

697
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,876
Scott: And I really wanted to finish it.

698
00:41:57,298 --> 00:41:59,430
Scott: And it said go to pencil pup dot com to read the rest.

699
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:03,410
Scott: And I'm like, oh, I wish I would have known that I could have just read it all at pencil pup dot com.

700
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,350
Scott: But the actual little mini comic is really cute.

701
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:12,210
Scott: The way it's constructed, it looks sort of like one of those black and white covered notebook things with the pencil pup on it.

702
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,882
Scott: And pencil pup is the best.

703
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:14,749
Scott: You should read pencil pup.

704
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,052
Rym: No, I got to.

705
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:23,670
Rym: So Molly Ostertag, you know, she has a strong female protagonist, but she also has Kutulun, the wrestler princess.

706
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:24,574
Scott: Oh, snap.

707
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,289
Rym: It's about Scott Mongolians.

708
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:28,118
Scott: Oh, shit.

709
00:42:28,158 --> 00:42:28,704
Scott: Cons.

710
00:42:28,967 --> 00:42:29,270
Scott: Oh, shit.

711
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:29,953
Rym: Wrestling.

712
00:42:30,316 --> 00:42:32,370
Scott: Oh, it's those are all good things.

713
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,296
Scott: Look at that art, too.

714
00:42:33,396 --> 00:42:35,049
Scott: Those are all the best things so far.

715
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:35,812
Scott: Almost.

716
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:40,830
Rym: Yeah, that that's probably the most impressive thing that we got that we have in our possession for Mocha this year.

717
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,337
Scott: Check out that wolf.

718
00:42:41,398 --> 00:42:42,190
Scott: You look wrestling.

719
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:43,032
Scott: Yeah.

720
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:46,250
Scott: Oh, they might be in love while wrestling.

721
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:46,673
Scott: Yep.

722
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:47,359
Scott: Yep.

723
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:48,450
Scott: That's what's happening.

724
00:42:48,611 --> 00:42:49,670
Scott: Oh, but they're still wrestling.

725
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:49,711
Scott: OK.

726
00:42:52,091 --> 00:43:01,150
Rym: My head was that when I think about this, the Scandinavian comics area, most of the comics that were out were not in English and didn't have translations inserted in them.

727
00:43:01,891 --> 00:43:07,650
Rym: And I remember last year, most of those comics had little translation sheets with them and a lot of them were actually in English.

728
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:08,371
Scott: Mm hmm.

729
00:43:09,392 --> 00:43:20,267
Scott: So a Mocha or two ago, I bought a comic nurse nurse, which is about a nurse, but is actually this awesome sci fi kind of thing that people don't?

730
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,190
Scott: you don't realize what it is when you first look at it.

731
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:26,110
Scott: You got to read it and then you go, oh, shit, this is actually way above your expectations.

732
00:43:26,352 --> 00:43:28,190
Scott: It's by a girl named Katie Skelly.

733
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:34,870
Scott: And then a few some time ago on Boing Boing, I saw nurse nurse and I was like, whoa, what is nursing is doing on Boing Boing?

734
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,569
Scott: It totally deserves to be there, but I didn't expect to see it there.

735
00:43:38,212 --> 00:43:43,530
Scott: And they were talking about Operation Margarine, which is the new comic by Katie Skelly.

736
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,570
Scott: That is not nurse nurse.

737
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:48,970
Scott: So I bought breaking issues one and two of Operation Margarine.

738
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:50,449
Scott: Oh, snap, Margarine.

739
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:58,990
Rym: So I think we'll probably I think we're going to trickle in reviews of all these little comics as we share all of our bounty.

740
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,629
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to get really wet.

741
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,397
Scott: Let's let's end.

742
00:44:01,418 --> 00:44:02,370
Scott: All right.

743
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:07,690
Rym: Scott has to go home because it's about to look at that's going to go up on the roof and watch the show.

744
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:15,490
Scott: This is like some fucking like wizard cast, you know, cloud lightning spell action that came in really fast.

745
00:44:15,871 --> 00:44:21,286
Scott: Like literally as you're talking to you, the sky was white and now it is like evil.

746
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,750
Scott: guys are coming dark.

747
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:23,839
Rym: All right.

748
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:24,588
Rym: Then we'll leave it at that.

749
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:28,010
Rym: But we made it through a whole week with normal gig nights.

750
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:29,770
Rym: We're back to our normal schedule.

751
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,746
Rym: Things are as they should be.

752
00:44:32,814 --> 00:44:34,989
Rym: Expect our other lecture from PAX.

753
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,650
Rym: Expect our more GeekNights presents to tennis.

754
00:44:39,071 --> 00:44:41,850
Rym: Expect our other secret projects to slowly come to fruition.

755
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,469
Rym: Come see us at Anime Boston.

756
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:44,990
Rym: Come see us at ConnectiCon.

757
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:48,510
Rym: Come see us at PAX Australia and PAX Dev PAX Prime.

758
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:49,207
Scott: Expect us.

759
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,660
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

760
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,800
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Cat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

761
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:08,200

762
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,140
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

763
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,880
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

765
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,660
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

766
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,840
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

767
00:46:04,434 --> 00:46:05,650
Rym: I can't take this kind of pressure.

768
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:11,408
Rym: I must confess, one more dusty road would be just a road too long.

769
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,670
Rym: I just can't, I just can't, I just can't seem to get started.

770
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:26,448
Rym: Don't have the heart to live in the fast lane, all that is past and gone.

771
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:34,529
Rym: There ain't nothing you can do about it.

772
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,709
Scott: Heard me while I panicked.

773
00:46:43,821 --> 00:46:45,139
Scott: I come from KC, Missouri.

774
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,901
Scott: And I got my kicks out of Route 66.

775
00:46:48,901 --> 00:46:50,193
Scott: Every truck stop from View 2MO.

776
00:46:53,221 --> 00:46:54,335
Rym: Motown to old Alabama.

777
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,520
Rym: From Texas, Canada and East to Savannah.

778
00:46:59,821 --> 00:47:01,459
Scott: From Tampa to old Kokomo.

779
00:47:03,161 --> 00:47:03,287
Scott: Yeah!

780
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,431
Scott: Good best.

781
00:47:08,185 --> 00:47:13,603
Scott: I once ran the Indy 500.

782
00:47:13,603 --> 00:47:15,900
Rym: I must confess, I'm impressed how I did it.

783
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,798
Rym: I wonder how close that I came.

784
00:47:20,301 --> 00:47:21,899
Scott: Now I get a second sensation.

785
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:25,820
Scott: I was the top of the line, out of sight, out of mind.

786
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,319
Scott: So much for fortune and fame.

787
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:30,099
Rym: Once took a text into a wedding.

788
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,859
Scott: Once took a text into a wedding.

789
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,519
Rym: He kept forgetting his loneliness.

790
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:38,117
Rym: Letting his thoughts turn to home and return.

791
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,358
Scott: I took a man to a graveyard.

792
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:45,599
Scott: I beg your pardon, it's quite hard enough.

793
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,718
Scott: Living with the stuff out of plan.

794
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:52,404
Scott: But black.

795
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:56,198
Scott: Once drove us up at the sunset.

796
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,660
Rym: There were bikinis and buns, there were weenies.

797
00:48:00,021 --> 00:48:01,199
Scott: But we just couldn't forget.

798
00:48:04,143 --> 00:48:05,358
Scott: Ico, let's go up to Zuma.

799
00:48:06,862 --> 00:48:08,115
Scott: Ico, let's go up to Zuma.

800
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,879
Scott: Zuma to Zuma, the rumor was I had a hand in the lay of the land.

801
00:48:16,343 --> 00:48:17,838
Scott: In a bingo hit the highway.

802
00:48:37,532 --> 00:48:39,029
Scott: I worked on a reservation.

803
00:48:41,713 --> 00:48:45,789
Scott: Who would believe they would love me and leave on a bus back to old Santa Fe.

804
00:48:48,574 --> 00:48:50,069
Scott: Once in a new nation.

805
00:48:51,531 --> 00:48:53,419
Scott: I took the kids on the stairs with a hope.

806
00:48:53,439 --> 00:48:55,388
Scott: he was happy to lie and say.

807
00:48:57,612 --> 00:48:58,609
Scott: You're worthless.
