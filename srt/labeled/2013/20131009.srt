00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,862
Rym: Hey, it's Wednesday October 9th, 2013.

2
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:13,423
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:16,170
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:32,276
Scott: Let's do this Didn't we already do that show?

5
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:35,629
Rym: well like really recently we kind of reviewed it.

6
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:43,317
Rym: You know we used to do this thing on gig nights where we'd preview a show like we'd watch one episode and say whether or Not was worth watching at all Because we had no ideas.

7
00:00:43,337 --> 00:00:45,150
Scott: we had to milk every episode of GeekNights.

8
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,090
Rym: We could out of everything we watched and then we do the review which was the all right.

9
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,510
Rym: We've seen a bunch of the show should you watch it, but we don't spoil anything.

10
00:00:55,152 --> 00:00:58,383
Rym: And then we would do the final thoughts which is the.

11
00:00:58,423 --> 00:00:59,607
Rym: yeah, we'll just talk about it.

12
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:07,590
Rym: We assume you've seen it And we haven't actually been able to talk about attack on Titan on the show with spoilers.

13
00:01:08,512 --> 00:01:11,006
Rym: We kind of danced around everything and that's what you want to do.

14
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:11,328
Scott: episode.

15
00:01:12,474 --> 00:01:14,425
Scott: I kind of just want to be like fuck spoilers forever.

16
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:15,390
Scott: I don't believe it.

17
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,080
Rym: Oh, yeah But there's a good reason to review things without revealing everything about.

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,788
Scott: people won't listen to my podcast because they believe in spoilers.

19
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:27,750
Rym: the point Of a review is to tell someone whether or not media is worth consuming for them.

20
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:29,014
Rym: For them.

21
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,298
Rym: is the media worth consuming?

22
00:01:30,378 --> 00:01:31,562
Scott: are you an anime fan?

23
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:32,566
Scott: Do you watch animes?

24
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:33,810
Scott: watch this show the end?

25
00:01:34,634 --> 00:01:35,903
Rym: Yeah, but we can talk about why.

26
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:36,690
Rym: I mean people like her.

27
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:44,603
Rym: I mean, you don't need to know why some people we know really like kill la kill and some people we know Really don't like kill la kill.

28
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:45,990
Rym: I like kill la kill.

29
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:46,895
Scott: I like kill like.

30
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:49,229
Rym: I can describe what I like about the show.

31
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:52,920
Rym: Oh, which would tell some people why not to like it.

32
00:01:52,961 --> 00:02:00,890
Rym: For example, if I say the words Scott kill la kill Reminds me aesthetically of an updated apocalypse zero awesome.

33
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:03,710
Rym: You might say something like awesome or fuck.

34
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:07,199
Rym: But a normal human being would say oh my god.

35
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:08,783
Rym: and now watch it.

36
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:15,170
Scott: well, that's just the thing is like why It's like the amount of time and effort it takes to get the reviews.

37
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:18,205
Scott: You could have just watched it and found out for yourself.

38
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:19,110
Rym: Not necessarily.

39
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:23,584
Rym: Yeah, watch a whole show all the episode one episode.

40
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:24,486
Rym: That's what the previews.

41
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:25,469
Scott: That's all we've watched.

42
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:26,817
Scott: Kill la kill.

43
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:27,682
Rym: Well kill la kill.

44
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:28,748
Rym: Yeah, so we'll get right into it.

45
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:39,930
Rym: Kill la kill came out very recently and it's worth talking about early because It kind of proved that trigger is not a flash in the pan, right?

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,360
Scott: So if you don't know there's a new anime studio on the scene called trigger.

47
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:46,490
Scott: They started by making inferno couple inferno cup.

48
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:49,342
Rym: Well, they started by doing two other piddly projects.

49
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:51,190
Scott: It's probably just contracts to get the money, right?

50
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,410
Scott: Yeah, you do like a video game FMV stuff like that one episode.

51
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,681
Rym: Just the animation of idol mask.

52
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:59,610
Scott: yeah Gonzo did the same sort of things, right?

53
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,313
Scott: They made like right.

54
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:03,310
Scott: but the first anime they made which is on YouTube is inferno.

55
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:08,190
Scott: And when you saw in finna cup, you knew whoever was making that.

56
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:09,694
Scott: Knew the deal.

57
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:18,290
Scott: the animation quality wasn't there in inferno couple which was kind of by design But you knew whoever was writing that thing was real anime.

58
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:20,078
Scott: That is the real deal.

59
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:22,870
Rym: could have been a flash in the play could have been a flash.

60
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:27,010
Scott: Look the anime boncho whoever it is that makes the peeping life and all that stuff, right?

61
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:33,863
Scott: they had turning girls, which is great and now the current one is like a Detective dog agency, which is in.

62
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:38,821
Rym: it's not turning girls Yep, or even look at the history of guy next guy next is all over the place.

63
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:48,085
Rym: Yeah, even Jillian mohoromatic Whoa, I remember a lot of people started watching mohoromatic is they were like guy next guy next.

64
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:51,474
Scott: at that time when that came out Gainax could do new wrong.

65
00:03:51,595 --> 00:04:01,330
Rym: Yep, and then I watched mohoromatic and I was like what what what show bit same show God anyway, so but then little witch academia.

66
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:05,099
Scott: Yeah, so little witch academia was by trigger as well.

67
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:07,707
Scott: And that's like whoa, they can fucking animate can't they?

68
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:12,170
Scott: they had the skills They just didn't use them on inferno cup and we talked about little witch academia.

69
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:14,179
Rym: So I'll just link to that episode in.

70
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,220
Scott: little witch academia is great But it's possible yet again that a get another fluke right.

71
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,075
Scott: some weird YouTube show and a weird special young Animators funded project.

72
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,801
Rym: a cool one episode short.

73
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:29,330
Rym: I mean every genius party is great.

74
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:31,155
Scott: That's studio 4c there.

75
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:35,647
Rym: Yeah, but it's hard to turn one of those into an actual show.

76
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:38,604
Scott: I think it is Yeah, so but even still both of the.

77
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,168
Scott: it was studio 4c.

78
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,898
Scott: So it's still possible that this trigger.

79
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,510
Scott: the two things they had done were sort of special cases and they were both good.

80
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,110
Scott: So it's like are they really good or are they just special cases now?

81
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,470
Rym: They kick-started another episode of little witch academia waiting on that stuff.

82
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:54,929
Scott: We don't the jury's out.

83
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:06,789
Scott: But in the meantime, they have a real anime an original anime not based on a manga not based on a light novel not based on a visual novel not based on anything just its original anime TV series.

84
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:10,284
Scott: and They made it all on their own the writing and the animating.

85
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:11,490
Scott: and it's on TV now.

86
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,055
Scott: First episode was last week.

87
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:16,547
Scott: The second episode is tomorrow the Thursday the 10th.

88
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:19,296
Scott: Yep It's gonna be on the crunchy rolls.

89
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:21,923
Rym: If only I had thorns like a thistle.

90
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:25,415
Rym: Yes episode 2 so sexy I'm gonna faint.

91
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:28,388
Scott: Yeah, so it's kill la kill.

92
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:33,111
Scott: and Is this gonna be good based on episode 1?

93
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:34,550
Scott: conclusive 100%.

94
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,672
Scott: this isn't no Deal.

95
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:44,109
Rym: you may not like the new guy next some people will do.

96
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:51,990
Rym: But I know people who don't like you like him but watching this episode It brought it almost it was like the flashback.

97
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:56,130
Rym: Like if you were watching the show about me watching this episode to watch it again.

98
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,685
Scott: And I was like did someone actually just make that our Savior?

99
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:00,549
Scott: I bow to thee.

100
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:14,610
Rym: Yeah ground would go black and it would cut to flashbacks of me sitting in the audience of the RIT anime club or Sitting in the lounge in Peterson 3 watching a weird old anime that Scott found in the anime club library.

101
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:19,146
Rym: That's some old senior in the club told us to watch going.

102
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:21,916
Rym: Whoa Yeah, this get this show.

103
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:23,342
Rym: We'll talk about it again.

104
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:25,430
Scott: You know, it hasn't been in a long time.

105
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,756
Scott: I think it's anime season.

106
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:29,769
Scott: people have been like space dandy the anime that will save anime.

107
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:30,673
Rym: I think.

108
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:41,758
Scott: maybe kill it attack on Titan kill la kill space dandy The battle against the dread specter of moe As is well underway.

109
00:06:41,838 --> 00:06:43,523
Scott: Well, maybe winning.

110
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:45,470
Rym: I've said this before but in more detail.

111
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:52,950
Rym: Madoka was the show that got people like us to watch anime again as it was coming out because it was just so great.

112
00:06:53,772 --> 00:07:03,969
Rym: But attack on Titan got all the anime fans that weren't watching a lot of anime all of them Not just people like us to watch that show and then start watching other shows.

113
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:16,179
Rym: And now kill la kill and then the coming space dandy and suddenly there's all these shows coming out and we've got this huge audience of anime fans who kind of Came back to anime because of attack on Titan

114
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:25,430
Scott: not to mention a bunch of shows that were sort of under the radar that were Dug up say like a space brothers or an eccentric family that were just sort of sitting there hiding amongst the the dregs.

115
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:31,129
Scott: Yeah, I mean silver people people bothered to uncover because they got brought back to the yard.

116
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:38,674
Rym: and You know, once again when we reviewed all that anime from that season before it came out Still pretty accurate.

117
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:39,377
Scott: Hmm.

118
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,744
Scott: Yeah, so let's talk about kill la kill a little bit.

119
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:50,670
Rym: Okay animation is The best but it's it's this sort of retro cool, but with good modern techniques.

120
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:56,030
Scott: Yeah, it's somewhere between like remember that Kevin knows me that was the right the weird the enemy.

121
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:58,830
Scott: It's got a little bit of that a little bit of fist of the North Star.

122
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:02,629
Rym: It's got a little bit of not fist of the North Star more like otaku or toku juku.

123
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:15,516
Scott: Yeah, man school it also has a even a little bit of Akira in there right like those scenes will be giant red text and Zooming the camera just going down the town from the top of the school Zooming out like that.

124
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:17,826
Rym: all the characters new tenor have analogs.

125
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:23,370
Scott: in this show This it is a tenor plus something plus apocalypse zero.

126
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,501
Scott: I mean, it's like you have a student council that rules this school.

127
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:29,854
Scott: They're the elites that they have these powers And they right.

128
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:31,640
Scott: it's definitely something.

129
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:36,015
Scott: it's really lines up with the antenna a lot Yeah, but it's almost.

130
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:39,789
Rym: you know, the way I would almost say this this is kind of is even a walk about that.

131
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:40,518
Scott: It's just yep.

132
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:43,491
Scott: That's walk about right there Escaflowne.

133
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,758
Rym: the show was a show.

134
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,410
Rym: Yeah, and then there was the movie which was kind of whoa.

135
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,662
Rym: So there was a parallel thing.

136
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:51,954
Rym: It was not in the same universe It was kind of kind.

137
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:58,474
Rym: it was the same characters, but every character was sort of distilled and more intense Like focus.

138
00:08:58,555 --> 00:09:02,448
Rym: take one aspect and then push it to the extreme of what that character was like.

139
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:02,969
Rym: a show.

140
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:05,435
Rym: Kill la kill kinda is.

141
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:10,230
Rym: you could say that it's kind of like that with you Tena that you look at these characters.

142
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:18,950
Rym: It's like yeah Take one part of utenna her tomboy bad attitude and just take it to the ridiculous extreme and give her half a pair of scissors.

143
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:26,230
Scott: So yeah, what the show is about is there's a horrible school that is ruled by a student council and they have uniforms.

144
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:27,076
Scott: They give them power.

145
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:29,110
Rym: Oh my god, the Goku seifuku, right?

146
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:30,714
Scott: So the one thing.

147
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:35,910
Scott: so most of the students are regular students and they're just busy victims trying to get through school without getting killed.

148
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,079
Rym: But they're all pretty chill with it.

149
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:38,389
Rym: They're like, this is just how it is.

150
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,935
Scott: Well, they're also kind of badass.

151
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,261
Scott: even the regular students, right?

152
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,670
Rym: There's zero star students are pretty badass, right?

153
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,969
Scott: So then I mean, it's a badass town that badass rabbit.

154
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:52,302
Rym: It's like the island that Kenshiro goes to at the end.

155
00:09:52,322 --> 00:10:00,390
Scott: Oh, okay But anyway, so then this one-star uniforms two-star and three-star and the more stars the more powerful you are.

156
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,388
Scott: Those are the people who are favored by the student council who hands out the uniform and the opening.

157
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:04,810
Rym: basically.

158
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,355
Scott: So it's usually like the club.

159
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:10,430
Scott: the sport club captains are really powerful and stuff, right at the beginning of the show.

160
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:27,168
Rym: You get this, you know, the this there's a normal class going on in this obviously post-apocalyptic world Very very apocalypse zero style in there and then out of nowhere this crazy Trigun villain looking guy just breaks down the door and fucking murders a kid.

161
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:32,010
Rym: But the kid kind of deserved it because he tried to steal a one-star Goku uniform.

162
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,710
Scott: Yeah, one star is like you are a really good basketball player in the basketball team.

163
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:50,302
Scott: You know what a one star is like captain of the basketball team and three star is like There's these elite four who are under the student council president who don't even know how many stars they that girl Her surname is very similar to togas surname.

164
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:51,546
Scott: Yeah, right exactly.

165
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:52,550
Rym: Here you carry you in.

166
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:58,090
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, the three stars are the elite four people who are underneath the student council president.

167
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,540
Scott: Which is the disciplinary guy?

168
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,627
Scott: Who's the guy at the beginning?

169
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:03,290
Rym: Oh my god Dynamites, what's his name?

170
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:10,220
Scott: The guy who's in charge of all sport clubs the guy the girl who's in charge of all non sport clubs And then that weird guy with the computer.

171
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:11,509
Scott: Well, I don't know what he was in charge of.

172
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:22,298
Rym: So this nerdy kid who had stolen a one-star Goku uniform and the guy's like you shit bird You're not even worthy of wearing this.

173
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:24,569
Rym: go ahead put it on or I'll just kill you right now.

174
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:28,722
Rym: And he puts it on and he's immediately transformed into a handsome badass.

175
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:29,043
Scott: Yep.

176
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:36,766
Scott: Well as bad as that body can get yeah But he turns handsome and he's awesome and then they just kill him because he's a three-star.

177
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:38,130
Scott: He's immune to one stars.

178
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:41,062
Rym: So there's a little bit of paranoia going on in there too.

179
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:48,130
Scott: red level blue love I mean, yeah that kind of people that kind of paranoid that people listening might not have understood what you meant.

180
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:52,310
Rym: Yeah, our paranoia the role-playing game was tabletop role-playing game, right?

181
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,766
Scott: Anyway, so this girl shows up in town who's clearly utenna and she goes to the school.

182
00:11:57,826 --> 00:11:58,790
Scott: She works her way up there.

183
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,996
Scott: She gets harassed by walking.

184
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:02,850
Scott: She's got typical anime intro with a transfer student.

185
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:06,490
Scott: Yeah, and she you know, you find out she's looking for something, right?

186
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,960
Scott: She's up to no good and she's not afraid of any bullshit.

187
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,310
Scott: So she finally sees this student council president.

188
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,915
Scott: She's like who's the top dog around here?

189
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:14,981
Scott: That's the one I'm challenging you.

190
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:17,208
Scott: and she's got this giant half a scissor.

191
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:17,770
Scott: is her weapon.

192
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,553
Scott: It's basically a sword.

193
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:27,882
Rym: This show is all about those moments where a character who is more important than you Notices something and does the slight eyebrow raise and says interesting.

194
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:30,510
Rym: Hmm that happens all the time.

195
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,650
Scott: She's got this giant half a scissor and she's challenged.

196
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:40,299
Scott: She's coming from transfer student first day to challenging but basically the god of the school Yeah, like it and then shit goes down.

197
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,210

222
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:58,390
Rym: I got a small geek bite Randomly found some episodes of Teen Titans go which is a read you're really got nothing to do.

223
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,243
Rym: No, it's a riri redo of Teen Titans.

224
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:02,570
Scott: Why did they really redo?

225
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,904
Scott: Why don't I just keep going with what they had what they kind of sucked?

226
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:07,250
Rym: I don't like Teen Titans.

227
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,595
Rym: Okay, I don't like the characters.

228
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:12,270
Scott: the original cartoon this you should try reading the original comic.

229
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,710
Scott: Yeah, I know Ben like all that Donna Troy bullshit the original Teen Titans cartoon.

230
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:21,069
Rym: What many people not just me complained that it was?

231
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:41,170
Rym: pseudo anime that it was an American style lame-o cartoon that took the tropes like the superficial tropes of what people would stereotypically associate with anime and just kind of rammed him into the show to take advantage of the then soaring popularity of quote-unquote anime.

232
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:50,089
Rym: you know that was in like 2002 2003 when anime was on this huge plateau peak before the steep decline.

233
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,519
Scott: Popularity coming back.

234
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:56,502
Rym: I think it's coming back, but It was not a good show.

235
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:57,469
Rym: I didn't like it.

236
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,895
Rym: there wasn't much going on there.

237
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:10,979
Rym: Teen Titans go which started in April this year is really funny and I need to watch more episodes before I review it fully but I Find it utterly hilarious.

238
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,915
Rym: and the reason why is simple one It doesn't.

239
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:16,118
Rym: it's funny for the same reason.

240
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,468
Rym: anime news Nina is funny to use a recent exam like a news.

241
00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:21,035
Rym: Nina exactly Why do we like it?

242
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,569
Rym: because anime news Nina isn't afraid of?

243
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:28,623
Rym: actually Going to kind of dark places and making fun of itself and making a lot of.

244
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:37,081
Scott: I mostly like it because it it's one of those things where If you aren't a person who goes to anime cons and stuff like that Then none of those things will mean anything to you, right?

245
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:40,986
Scott: It's one of those really targeted It's really funny to a very small subset of people.

246
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:47,883
Rym: Yep But it also will Basically ridicule the kinds of people who also go to that site.

247
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:49,850
Rym: it ridicules the site's customers.

248
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:56,709
Rym: It'd be like if the New York Times ran a comic that just literally shat all over the culture of the people who read the New York Times.

249
00:15:57,693 --> 00:15:59,137
Rym: You know the scary fanboy guy.

250
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:03,190
Rym: it is not a kind comic to that kind of person like our valued customers.

251
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:04,909
Rym: Yeah, exactly like that.

252
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:11,049
Rym: Okay So Teen Titans go kind of goes in that direction and that it's not like the comics and it's just.

253
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:16,859
Rym: it's more like Adventure Time In that it's goes to kind of weird and dark place.

254
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,945
Scott: Oh, I guess it's bandwagoning again.

255
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:20,490
Scott: Yeah, what's popular now?

256
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,256
Scott: Let's copy that.

257
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:22,749
Rym: Ah, but well done.

258
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:26,821
Rym: Hmm, and I've actually enjoyed the episodes that I've watched.

259
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:30,330
Rym: We'll see if I like it enough, but it's kind of dark.

260
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:30,872
Scott: I don't.

261
00:16:30,953 --> 00:16:32,581
Scott: I don't have I don't need another show to watch.

262
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:34,470
Rym: I think people people die.

263
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:45,263
Rym: There's a lot of oddly sexual jokes that don't really seem to fit who you'd expect the show to be aimed at the shows Aimed at 30 year olds instead of 13 year olds.

264
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:46,369
Rym: Just put it like that.

265
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:49,969
Scott: That's what 30 year olds say when they like a show aimed at three year olds.

266
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,880
Rym: My little pony was aimed at 11 year olds.

267
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,342
Scott: Same thing.

268
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:58,070
Rym: It just happened to be popular among.

269
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,811
Scott: Yes, let's move on.

270
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,540
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

271
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,180
Rym: So you Scott's thinking that is pretty pretty good.

272
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,041
Rym: I did not see this.

273
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:26,787
Scott: so in the 70s, New York City, not the greatest right now like it is now and There was actually At that time the police were getting underfunded and not only did was their crime and heart, you know It was way worse than it is now.

274
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:28,638
Scott: It was like taxi driver kind of shit, right?

275
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,748
Scott: They were gonna Underfund the police and fire departments and such.

277
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,360
Rym: when it's like this the graphic design of this is evocative.

278
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:48,621
Rym: I'll just give you everything I love from the year 1981.

279
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:54,600
Scott: It's basically a pamphlet that gives advice to tourists who are coming to New York City and like here's a here's a small excerpt.

280
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:58,860

290
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:36,866
Scott: Mayor beam is not the mayor anymore.

291
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:39,255
Rym: No tourist would know who the mayor is.

292
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:40,560
Scott: tourists know who the mayor is.

293
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,354

Scott: No I just don't.

305
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:08,878
Scott: the only thing is de Blasio is gonna do the thing that I really care about which is Fuck the cable companies so they can stop rubbing their nipples.

306
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:17,227

00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,484

Rym: We didn't watch yet new Adventure Time - okay.

316
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:32,960
Rym: You're a little more behind than me.

317
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,670
Scott: I don't watch you adventure times as soon as they come out.

318
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:36,240
Scott: I do let him pile up a tiny bit.

319
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,085
Rym: Yeah, but that that infinity train.

320
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,468
Scott: Well, that was a good one on Monday.

321
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:40,752
Scott: This whole place is butter.

322
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:45,480
Rym: It is a Lot of you need to watch that up later.

323
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:48,230
Scott: The thing is the people it needs to help won't understand.

324
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:54,099
Rym: so speaking of fear city This is a really well done prank.

325
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:59,120
Rym: This guy rigged up a car to where he's hiding in the seat the driver's seat.

326
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:03,600
Scott: I've seen ones like that where the car drives up and there's no one there because he's disguised as a seat.

327
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:05,989
Rym: But but instead of having no one in the car.

328
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,659
Rym: He put a pretty realistic skeleton in the car.

329
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:12,415
Scott: Okay with his arms like set up the same guy who did the one where he.

330
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:13,680
Scott: yes same guy.

331
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,205
Rym: Yeah, go to this guy's channel.

332
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:17,192
Rym: It is nothing but pranks.

333
00:20:17,252 --> 00:20:17,894
Scott: How does he run?

334
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:19,660
Scott: doesn't he run out of fast-food places to prank?

335
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:21,102
Rym: Look at this.

336
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:22,064
Rym: Look at this channel.

337
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:25,955
Rym: drive through rocky raccoon drive through floating money drive through.

338
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:29,057
Rym: my wallet catches on fire when I try to pay.

339
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:35,179
Rym: Drive through I get a shock and faint and then the car drives away on its own.

340
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,048
Rym: This guy is the master of the.

341
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:41,299
Rym: pull up to it through a drive-through window and scare the people there.

342
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:50,005
Rym: He's got one thing going for it's definitely somewhere in the south because he keeps going to chick-fil-a's and people keep saying y'all Oh, I randomly paused it.

343
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:50,265
Rym: I'm like.

344
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:52,050
Rym: the subtitle says y'all nice.

345
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:55,258
Rym: So the reason this prank works is that one.

346
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:55,860
Rym: it's dark.

347
00:20:56,845 --> 00:21:07,465
Rym: So the skeleton looks kind of real good - even though a human who is rational will once their brain catches up Think to themselves.

348
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:10,400
Rym: There's no way that is a skeleton.

349
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:12,920
Scott: It is a skeleton.

350
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,351
Scott: Well any time you are a human course it is.

351
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:17,114
Scott: what else would it be?

352
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:18,318
Rym: and a skeleton is?

353
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,693
Rym: In a place that you did not expect a skeleton to be there is at least a moment of oh fuck There's one in my body.

354
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:29,180
Rym: Oh fuck Yeah, but if you see it and you don't expect to see it like if I look at an x-ray machine.

355
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:34,290
Rym: I love skeletons like the skeleton to be there, but like if I wake up in the morning I played magic back in the day.

356
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:38,165
Scott: I like to use drudge scale Stematically, I like skeletons.

357
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:42,584
Rym: if you're home right and you wake up in the morning and you go to the bathroom staff Oh, it's my favorite zone.

358
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,776
Rym: There's just a skeleton like laying in your tub.

359
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:47,770
Rym: I Predict there'd be at least a moment where you go.

360
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:48,473
Rym: Oh, whoa.

361
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:52,700
Scott: I'd be like yes free skeleton Sweet those are expensive.

362
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:54,425
Scott: So the real wonder if it's real.

363
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:59,080
Rym: the third reason this Frank's what prank works is that the skeleton drives up and doesn't do anything.

364
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,844
Rym: It just sits there.

365
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:04,424
Scott: Oh, it was so much better if the skeleton was like putting its hand out as you know There right.

366
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:08,780
Rym: if the people like lean in it leans forward like it's gonna ask him a question.

367
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,468
Rym: Usually they lose it then and it can also.

368
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:12,812
Rym: this is the final important piece.

369
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,240
Rym: It can drive the car away on its own.

370
00:22:16,023 --> 00:22:24,759
Rym: so there's this moment where it pulls up and these people are kind of like a the fuck and then the woman's like Gonna just throw the food in the car and then it starts to drive away and she just loses it.

371
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:26,936
Rym: But then this guy in the background is like oh shit.

372
00:22:26,977 --> 00:22:34,465
Rym: He leaving That.

373
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:35,838
Scott: that's the line right there.

374
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:42,680
Rym: Now if I were gonna do this prank one step better, I would buy a car from a junk lot with trash.

375
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,633
Rym: Acquire a real human skeleton.

376
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:46,820
Rym: rig it up like this.

377
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,170
Rym: So the car just drives up and that's it.

378
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,360
Rym: It just stays there with the real human skeleton.

379
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:53,025
Rym: Wait for that shit to go down.

380
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:55,553
Rym: wait for that to at least to show up.

381
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,620
Rym: Yeah, it's a real human skeleton.

382
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,385
Rym: Where'd it come from?

383
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:00,034
Scott: Oh my god the car sets on fire.

384
00:23:00,437 --> 00:23:01,555
Rym: Yes Mm-hmm.

385
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:04,799
Rym: No, just the skeleton sets on fire.

386
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:09,934
Rym: That would ruin a few people's days and probably require some counseling.

387
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:10,777
Rym: but it's a little.

388
00:23:10,797 --> 00:23:13,711
Scott: you wouldn't want the Fast-food restaurant to set on fire in there.

389
00:23:13,731 --> 00:23:15,360
Rym: No, you gotta make sure just the skeleton, right?

390
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,317
Scott: Okay, so in meta moment book club book is Stasi land.

391
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:19,860

00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,472

Rym: Yeah, exactly Except I know some people listen to the show.

444
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,815
Rym: So I'd have to edit that out if I was gonna do that.

445
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:31,400
Scott: just do it.

446
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,263

00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,371
Scott: I don't know.

449
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:36,499
Scott: I don't make it a holiday boss, man.

450
00:25:38,462 --> 00:25:42,963
Rym: So, uh, yeah attack on Titan ended Season one.

451
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:45,429
Rym: there might not be more in a while years.

452
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,031
Rym: Yeah.

453
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:48,177
Rym: Well, maybe not years years.

454
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:49,440
Rym: Maybe not years.

455
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:54,527
Rym: There's a way they could do it in a shorter time Island episodes now They don't have to know they wouldn't do.

456
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:55,151
Rym: Island episodes.

457
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:56,480
Rym: that would kill that momentum.

458
00:25:57,135 --> 00:26:04,760
Rym: but If you care about spoilers stop listening right now, and why would you even be attack on Titan?

459
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,820
Scott: Seriously, if you're an animal people have been talking about this show so the fuck much.

460
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:11,838
Scott: How can you just continue to ignore it?

461
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:13,748
Scott: Even we're talking about it.

462
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:15,379
Scott: That's yeah, we couldn't even ignore it.

463
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,523
Rym: Yeah We started.

464
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:17,728
Rym: why we went from.

465
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:23,933
Scott: I'll wait till that show to what we went from but then again I ignore all those shows that everyone else talks about like the Breaking Beds and whatever.

466
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:26,041
Rym: I watched a good chunk of Breaking Beds All right.

467
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:26,924
Rym: It's all right.

468
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:29,732
Rym: It's so uh, it's no house of cards.

469
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:30,756
Scott: I didn't?

470
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:32,039
Scott: I watched one episode of that man.

471
00:26:32,703 --> 00:26:37,373
Rym: I really house of cards is my favorite Three-dimensional show in recent memory.

472
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:41,391
Rym: Yeah Whatever right up there with Archer South Park.

473
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:44,080
Rym: Yeah up Simpsons has actually been pretty good lately.

474
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:46,070
Scott: Well, someone's gonna hit you on that.

475
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:52,573
Rym: Yes, Simpsons has been Consistently as funny as like season 10 and 11.

476
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:54,400
Scott: I haven't seen a Simpsons a long-ass time.

477
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,553
Scott: Yeah, it's it's kind of back but I still remember it so much.

478
00:26:57,613 --> 00:27:05,656
Scott: a guy at work was all like Is that some guy had a mug with two hammers on it and you're like, oh, yeah No, the other co-worker was like, is that a stonecutter's mug?

479
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:06,140
Scott: and I'm like.

480
00:27:07,941 --> 00:27:08,322
Scott: It's like.

481
00:27:08,342 --> 00:27:11,073
Scott: we know it's take off the stone of James.

482
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,700
Scott: Oh, yeah the stone of triumph.

483
00:27:13,162 --> 00:27:21,816
Rym: Well the other day we were looking at Fark and there was that article about Reagan's arm being cut off and I was like there's Gonna be a picture of Jeb and I was Springfield's head being cut off in the first few comments on Fark.

484
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:26,614
Rym: sure enough Yep, and it was someone who's been reading Fark as long as I have so there's probably seen.

485
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:32,023
Scott: maybe I should just watch rewatch every Simpsons ever in order, you know Every.

486
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:41,783
Rym: I watched every episode of the Simpsons including the specials on the Tracy Allman show as They came out with my family up until the year 2000 hmm.

487
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:52,286
Rym: and then at RIT that year when we were freshmen We continued that and watched every episode as it came out on that 1974 color.

488
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:58,237
Rym: I didn't watch all of them almost all of them watched a few of them Most of them because we watch them while we're hanging out in the lounge before we play D&D.

489
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:05,368
Rym: Anyway, I digress fucking spoilers, uh Yeah, there's Titans in the walls.

490
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:06,455
Scott: I guess I don't know.

491
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:06,817
Scott: see now.

492
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:08,547
Scott: Here's the thing I'm based on.

493
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:10,720
Scott: there's people who've read the manga which is way ahead of the anime.

494
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:12,668
Rym: Oh, I got shit to say about the manga.

495
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:14,736
Rym: right and those people but we'll get to.

496
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,820
Scott: basically it's like, okay.

497
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:22,360
Scott: So when I see if I I didn't see the sting over the fry in that last episode I turned it off and people were like, oh you gotta go back and watch it.

498
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:31,513
Scott: So I go back and I see it and it's like, okay they show you they zoom into the hole in the wall and you see a Titan face and it's like You can interpret that as they're being literal Titans in the walls.

499
00:28:31,573 --> 00:28:33,340
Scott: And apparently that's what it is.

500
00:28:33,641 --> 00:28:36,615
Rym: Oh, I see you're coming from especially because the way it's drawn.

501
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:37,740
Scott: Yeah, and it's so quick.

502
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:45,889
Scott: It's like that could just be like the stinger of the last episode being like hey, you know Not literally being Titans in the walls.

503
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:51,227
Scott: It could also be interpreted as like a Titan looking through the hole in the wall Or who knows why you don't know what the hell.

504
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:53,834
Rym: it could just be interpreted as stay tuned or now.

505
00:28:54,335 --> 00:29:07,600
Rym: all is not as it seems exactly, but the problem with attack on Titan now is Similar to what happened with full metal alchemist but to the extreme because of internet and progress of society.

506
00:29:08,422 --> 00:29:18,127
Rym: The manga is coming out and there are now three classes of people with in regards to attack on Titan people who are reading the updated Scanslations of the manga.

507
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,416
Scott: well in English-speaking world.

508
00:29:19,778 --> 00:29:28,215
Rym: Yes Well by four classes people in Japan sure people are reading the scans lated manga as it's coming out the way we used to do with death note.

509
00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:34,979
Rym: People who are reading the legit Translations of the manga as it's coming out.

510
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:38,774
Rym: People who are only watching the anime and what I.

511
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:44,213
Scott: so the legit translations are Almost caught up with the anime base like one more volume and that'll be.

512
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:46,880
Scott: they'll be matching in English and they're coming out once a month.

513
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:55,380
Scott: So it's like there's probably a volume already out or coming out this month that will basically match the anime in terms of English Legitimately published English manga yep.

514
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,768
Scott: And then like next month or the month after you'll be ahead of the TV show in the legit English Mangas, but here's the problem.

515
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:03,573
Scott: scans are way ahead.

516
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,237
Rym: There's the problem.

517
00:30:04,297 --> 00:30:15,760
Rym: I'm seeing commentary about the show both on the internet and in meatspace Seems to be driven by the false insight provided by those who have read ahead in the manga.

518
00:30:16,604 --> 00:30:20,000
Rym: So it's not the problem of just oh someone spoiled something.

519
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:33,889
Rym: It's the problem of someone watching the anime sees a Titan in the wall at the end and goes And then the friend who is reading the manga way ahead says something like oh now You know about the wall Titans, and it's like.

520
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:39,228
Rym: I'm merely saying it with the definite article one You're spoiling, but that's that's one problem.

521
00:30:39,248 --> 00:30:39,991
Scott: I don't care about that.

522
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,076
Rym: That is a problem though.

523
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:44,179
Rym: this separate problem Is the discussions that follow?

524
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,602
Rym: Trade Spoilers?

525
00:30:47,105 --> 00:30:54,659
Scott: right if the anime was all that existed We would simply be saying are there literal Titans in the walls, or what's the deal with that?

526
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:55,000
Scott: yeah?

527
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,231
Scott: What happens is what are they trying to say there, but is it getting out?

528
00:30:58,312 --> 00:30:59,576
Scott: What's going on instead?

529
00:30:59,597 --> 00:31:00,279
Scott: We're saying oh?

530
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,842
Scott: I guess there's actual literal Titans in the walls and your friends who are reading the manga Will.

531
00:31:05,962 --> 00:31:12,198
Rym: you'll see this watching the show and it's subtly different from the separate situation of someone who has seen a show.

532
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:18,724
Rym: is Guiding your commentary in a show like someone watching GeekNights presents, Utena We know what happens.

533
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:20,972
Rym: no, but we're instead of.

534
00:31:21,294 --> 00:31:38,831
Rym: there's a subtle difference between Using what you know to provide subtle insight versus versus using what you know to pretend toward insight and people will say things like ah But how do you know instead of this meta talk?

535
00:31:38,992 --> 00:31:41,800
Scott: Why do not we actually talk about attack on Titan all right?

536
00:31:42,021 --> 00:31:45,893
Rym: I really like the show and actually I was really satisfied with where season one ended.

537
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:48,100
Rym: it didn't end on a cliffhanger in my opinion.

538
00:31:48,502 --> 00:31:51,937
Scott: I was satisfied, but I would have liked a little bit more right.

539
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:55,060
Scott: It's like yeah, that was a good kind of place to stop.

540
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,165
Rym: You know what I wanted to see.

541
00:31:56,185 --> 00:32:06,220
Rym: if there was a denim on at the end of season one That wasn't the Titan face out of like to have seen a shadowy noble figure like a king or someone.

542
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,826
Rym: Yeah, walking to a shadowy military person where you don't see who they are But they have one conversation.

543
00:32:12,886 --> 00:32:15,037
Rym: like it was revealed it was it.

544
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:18,169
Rym: Oh Well, I guess you have to do the thing now.

545
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,840
Rym: very good, sir like one of those kinds of moments.

546
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:21,830
Scott: Oh, yeah, that could work.

547
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:22,760
Rym: That is what I want.

548
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,952
Scott: I definitely just want to know something about the goddamn king queen whatever the royal is.

549
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,299
Rym: well the question is is it a king bradley?

550
00:32:30,703 --> 00:32:31,408
Scott: How could it not be?

551
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:32,295
Rym: or is it an?

552
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,787
Rym: Actually good king like the second in command?

553
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:40,781
Scott: unlikely because that guy the guy who control his name all right guy who runs the military He's all.

554
00:32:40,802 --> 00:32:44,391
Scott: he's the guy who was the judge of the court-martial of Aaron.

555
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:52,448
Scott: that guy is the head of all three military parts the military police and The Garrison and the Survey Corps.

556
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:55,035
Scott: he's in charge of all trees the number one military guy.

557
00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:55,276
Scott: only.

558
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:57,604
Scott: the king is above him now in Any other show.

559
00:32:57,885 --> 00:33:01,100
Rym: and what I would have expected and what I did expect from attack on Titan?

560
00:33:01,681 --> 00:33:05,400
Rym: That guy would have been dumb or bad in some obvious way.

561
00:33:06,102 --> 00:33:14,165
Rym: But the fact that for all appearances in the anime he was fair intelligent and competent was amazing.

562
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:20,170
Scott: so one step away from the king is a guy who's Apparently good, so is the king really bad?

563
00:33:20,351 --> 00:33:23,100
Rym: or at least not capricious and arbitrary, but fair and competent?

564
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:30,819
Rym: He reminds me of what a character like Hughes from Fullmetal Alchemist would be if they made it to middle age And were put in a position of power.

565
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,822
Scott: Yeah, so like immediately under him are you know Erwin the bald guy with the mustache Pixis?

566
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:40,032
Scott: Pixis I love Pixis, and I don't know who's in charge of the military police.

567
00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:42,740
Rym: I don't know who's the head of the MPs.

568
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:44,788
Scott: I'm that's probably gonna be a bad person.

569
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:45,450
Scott: I don't.

570
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,060
Rym: I think it'll be an incompetent person and not a bad person.

571
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:57,193
Rym: I think it'll be a person that's not the greatest because it was obvious from toward the end that the military police are not themselves Individually evil except Annie.

572
00:33:57,495 --> 00:34:02,680
Rym: They're just Is she that are selfish and mildly incompetent, right?

573
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,080
Scott: I mean look we know there is some badness to the nobility because Pixis is playing chess with that noble person.

574
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:09,967
Rym: But they might just be corrupt shitheads.

575
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,927
Scott: Yeah, he wasn't horribly evil like Hitler But he was obviously corrupt.

576
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:16,159
Scott: not a good bird not not on the side of goodness.

577
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,897
Scott: He was like I'll save my skin and be rich and live lavishly fucked if the Titans eat all the poor people.

578
00:34:20,937 --> 00:34:28,243
Rym: his neutral evil Yeah, oh But The noble.

579
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:32,800
Rym: I don't think the nobles themselves are evil, I think they're just dumb, but there's definitely something up there, right?

580
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,554
Scott: This is the thing is that you know Annie was.

581
00:34:35,675 --> 00:34:36,699
Scott: you know it's like yeah?

582
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,338
Scott: She was killing all these people and whatnot and she turns into a Titan and they smashed the walls and they liked it.

583
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,675
Scott: She was happy when Titans were in the city and everybody, but why?

584
00:34:45,896 --> 00:34:46,820
Scott: why would they write?

585
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,257
Scott: It's clearly there is some battle between the people who can turn into the skinless Titans.

586
00:34:52,297 --> 00:35:00,779
Scott: the colossal time I think is everyone maybe but the skinless Titans are you know that group the people who came from that town which is?

587
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,980
Scott: Obviously Rainer is the is the armored Titan there, and you have to be dumb not to figure that out.

588
00:35:07,081 --> 00:35:09,778
Scott: I mean I haven't read any manga that says that or anything.

589
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:13,935
Scott: I Will bet a hundred thousand dollars that that is what he looks.

590
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:15,000
Scott: the same the same, right?

591
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:16,755
Scott: It's you to be dumb not to realize that?

592
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:19,073
Scott: yep It comes in the same town right.

593
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:20,080
Scott: then you got Annie.

594
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:20,803
Scott: Clearly.

595
00:35:21,004 --> 00:35:26,165
Scott: obviously as soon as you saw that female Titan you knew it was her just as obvious Colossal Titan.

596
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:27,349
Scott: who knows who the fuck that is?

597
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:29,437
Rym: I do because someone spoiled it.

598
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:29,959
Rym: for me, okay?

599
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:39,120
Scott: But anyway, but they're all on the same team right and they're clearly I think that they are fighting against not the even though they killed the people in the towns than the civilians.

600
00:35:39,563 --> 00:35:50,897
Scott: I think their actual fight that group is against the royalty right and they're that's what the fight is and Basically all of the civilians that they're killing all the Survey Corps people and whatever.

601
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:53,025
Scott: it's pretty much Just like you know.

602
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:53,868
Scott: those are.

603
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:57,961
Scott: they're working for my enemy, so the matrix exactly It's like.

604
00:35:58,001 --> 00:35:58,202
Scott: well.

605
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,065
Scott: Yeah agent Smith.

606
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:03,805
Scott: Just took over that human who's not a bad person, but they're in the matrix They're part of the system.

607
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:10,113
Scott: you're fighting on behalf of the military Survey Corps person So you're my enemy right now even if I like you You know it's

608
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:10,560
Rym: possible and

609
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:20,960
Scott: they were they were trying to capture Aaron probably to bring him to their side and tell him what was up because he you Titan power on their side and having him be on the other side not so good.

610
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:21,361
Rym: This is.

611
00:36:21,402 --> 00:36:27,523
Rym: what's interesting is if their goal was to actually fight against humanity and cause all this damage They could have succeeded along.

612
00:36:27,543 --> 00:36:33,060
Rym: there was no reason for them to stop as far as we saw in the anime in that first attack.

613
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,514
Scott: Exactly because well they stopped in the second.

614
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:36,460
Scott: Oh the first attack.

615
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:46,879
Rym: Yeah first big attack where they took down the Titan took off all the guns on the top and kicked a hole in and then the armored Titan Trivially broke down the gate into the inner side.

616
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:52,260
Scott: yeah They could have just gotten well It's a long way from there to the doesn't matter wall that Titan.

617
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:57,179
Rym: He could just go poof be a Titan and break through the wall without anyone yeah helping him.

618
00:36:57,661 --> 00:37:00,435
Rym: Hmm it is obvious that they could have just done it.

619
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:07,100
Rym: so either They didn't do it because that's not their goal, or they didn't do it because something happened that prevented them from doing it.

620
00:37:08,181 --> 00:37:09,044
Rym: Was it Aaron?

621
00:37:09,124 --> 00:37:09,445
Rym: was it?

622
00:37:09,485 --> 00:37:09,947
Rym: we don't know.

623
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:11,713
Scott: well the first time right?

624
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:11,953
Scott: is they?

625
00:37:11,994 --> 00:37:13,940
Scott: just they just busted through that town right whenever?

626
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,899
Scott: Aaron was small the second time.

627
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:21,894
Scott: Aaron's appearance basically Was what prevented them from breaking the second wall the inner wall of that city.

628
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:28,580
Scott: because remember they're breaking through like these cities that are Like little nipples on the edge, so they had to break two walls, which is why it's a little confusing.

629
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:32,693
Scott: It's like you know why was there the colossal Titan and then the shield Titan?

630
00:37:32,714 --> 00:37:37,660
Scott: well there were two walls to break to get through Right the one in the outside of the city and then the one on the inside.

631
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:43,588
Rym: But if the colossal Titan can get in like perhaps Annie and Rainer Then why does he just go?

632
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:44,332
Rym: well you know when is?

633
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:53,477
Rym: if he's in the military police for example like Annie She could just gone poof and probably taken out Everybody on her own because look no one can stop her.

634
00:37:53,497 --> 00:37:55,366
Rym: yeah No one can with.

635
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:58,016
Rym: the show is showing us the survey car can.

636
00:37:58,056 --> 00:38:04,780
Rym: kind of yeah Every time they stopped her she trivially escaped and was immediately kicking ass again.

637
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:19,040
Scott: Maybe right well remember first of all right the strongest people are always joined the military police But they also are all lazy and haven't practiced in a while, but maybe right the king will just turn into a Titan and then what?

638
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,605
Rym: Yeah, I don't think that would happen though.

639
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:25,680
Scott: You know there could be people on the king's side who could turn into titans.

640
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,712
Rym: Situation there is a different as far as everything we've seen.

641
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:36,757
Rym: there is a huge differential in power and Yet the people who are have the advantage are not pressing that advantage, and we don't know why.

642
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:45,736
Rym: yep Originally early in the show I had suspected that maybe Those Titans that did that first attack were trying to cause enough damage.

643
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:46,860
Scott: or remember humanity.

644
00:38:47,163 --> 00:38:47,707
Rym: It was a false.

645
00:38:47,748 --> 00:38:48,111
Rym: that's.

646
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:49,702
Scott: that's my other Theory.

647
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:52,231
Scott: right is that they are actually on the side of the king.

648
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:54,780
Scott: remember after that there was that thing where they had to send.

649
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,249
Scott: there Was you know too many people.

650
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:57,820
Scott: they had to send them all out?

651
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,004
Scott: To go get killed.

652
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:02,779
Scott: and that killed of a whole bunch of the populations that the food needs were getting went down.

653
00:39:03,482 --> 00:39:07,196
Scott: Maybe the royal people wanted that right to serve their own purpose.

654
00:39:07,297 --> 00:39:08,180
Rym: I thought it was more subtle.

655
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:21,640
Rym: I thought that maybe the royalty wanted the status quo and that these people who can turn into Titans did what they did Despite all the casualties to force humanity to confront their problems and fight back against the regular Titans.

656
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:23,112
Scott: but a false flag.

657
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:33,452
Scott: but if the Those big Titans could have just gone on behalf of humanity and gone out and killed all the Titans because they're so powerful Maybe not that colossal Titan could just go around killing all the Titans.

658
00:39:33,753 --> 00:39:35,620
Rym: ah but the sheer number of Titans.

659
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,590
Rym: And there's obviously a Titan spawner somewhere gauntlet style.

660
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:40,116
Scott: It's got to be something like that.

661
00:39:40,276 --> 00:39:41,320
Rym: so many Titans.

662
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,126
Scott: Yeah, who knows what the deal is?

663
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:47,380
Scott: it's the basement will tell us yeah at least at least you know.

664
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:49,340
Scott: They didn't show us the basement, which is like okay?

665
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,156
Scott: You gotta hold it off for some amount of time otherwise the characters are trying to get.

666
00:39:53,196 --> 00:39:55,747
Scott: at least they were like Let's get to that fucking basement.

667
00:39:55,787 --> 00:39:56,409
Scott: It's like okay.

668
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,920
Scott: At least they recognize it, and they just want to fucking go.

669
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:01,806
Scott: They just can't legitimately Okay with that.

670
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:10,480
Rym: how many times in a full metal alchemist was like go right there That's the mystery will wait blah blah blah blah blah blah plod plod plod right at least here, right?

671
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,367
Scott: It's like yeah, and he's the fucking site.

672
00:40:12,387 --> 00:40:14,335
Scott: They knew it wasn't some bullshit like.

673
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,440
Scott: I wonder who it is.

674
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,800
Scott: It's like we know who it is that scene.

675
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:20,752
Rym: I didn't realize what they were up to until they went down.

676
00:40:20,912 --> 00:40:21,595
Scott: I didn't either.

677
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:34,329
Rym: and then I was like oh They know yeah when they went down and Annie was like I'm not going down there, and then it cut to Aaron's face, and suddenly you see like his fist is clenched He's trembling and he turns around that moment.

678
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,075
Rym: I was like oh shit, son.

679
00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:40,066
Rym: Oh shit, son That was one of my favorite scenes in the show.

680
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:43,700
Rym: is that confrontation not the fight afterward just that confrontation?

681
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:53,958
Rym: I also like how the survey cars plan there was Actually really good, and they just got fucked by the fact that she had an extra that she had that ring like.

682
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:55,405
Rym: she had also Had a really good plan.

683
00:40:55,627 --> 00:41:04,138
Scott: Yeah, I mean really the only thing that The only thing that makes Annie so invincible is that her power of creating the armored spot on her body right.

684
00:41:04,158 --> 00:41:11,164
Rym: without that power She would have been fucked so hard so many times and she can just tighten and then when she gets untightened She gets tighten again immediately.

685
00:41:11,184 --> 00:41:12,147
Rym: She's never tired.

686
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,492
Scott: Yeah, well suppose.

687
00:41:13,532 --> 00:41:18,297
Scott: Maybe it's cuz she's you know keeps the skin off Tightened again.

688
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,720
Scott: Immediately after killing she got tired a little bit from running a lot.

689
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:24,447
Scott: She's super powered and super good.

690
00:41:24,628 --> 00:41:27,720
Rym: despite all that she just trivially kicked Aaron's ass twice.

691
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:32,682
Scott: Yeah, Aaron had to go all super angry mode Style.

692
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,269
Scott: yeah, it's a mecha show by the way.

693
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:36,720
Scott: I mean people have said this it's obvious, but yeah, it's a mega show.

694
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:38,475
Rym: I think all people can turn into Titans.

695
00:41:38,676 --> 00:41:43,177
Scott: obviously That either, but then why did Aaron need to have an injection to make it happen?

696
00:41:43,277 --> 00:41:44,000
Rym: I don't think he did.

697
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:45,419
Rym: I think there's something else going on there.

698
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,127
Rym: But the other thing could be going on.

699
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:48,970
Rym: is the Titans?

700
00:41:49,432 --> 00:42:01,440
Rym: either the mindless Titans are driverless or the person in them is Passive like they're subsumed in like when Aaron was in that one time and his Titan just going apeshit doing Titan shit.

701
00:42:02,183 --> 00:42:05,639
Rym: And yet he inside of the Titan is having this paradise dream.

702
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,940
Rym: Maybe maybe they all just have people having those paradise dreams.

703
00:42:09,522 --> 00:42:19,525
Rym: I'm also kind of worried that in the very beginning of the show the first episode right away Aaron has a dream slash flashback to things that happen later in the show Mmm.

704
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:20,799
Rym: What the fuck?

705
00:42:22,483 --> 00:42:22,947
Rym: Is the show?

706
00:42:23,189 --> 00:42:24,500
Rym: is he in a Titan the whole time?

707
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:26,583
Scott: Don't give me that shit.

708
00:42:26,603 --> 00:42:27,747
Rym: They're an outside world.

709
00:42:27,787 --> 00:42:31,337
Scott: beyond all this the walls of actually the walls of his mind.

710
00:42:31,437 --> 00:42:32,440
Rym: is it matrix?

711
00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:33,722
Rym: How come?

712
00:42:33,782 --> 00:42:36,551
Rym: is it a time loop Final Fantasy 1 style?

713
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:36,791
Rym: Yeah?

714
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:41,695
Rym: Why does he have flashbacks to the future from the Anyway future from the past.

715
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:44,423
Scott: I don't know He's.

716
00:42:44,483 --> 00:42:45,731
Scott: he died in that first time.

717
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,240
Scott: he died is still in the Titans belly.

718
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,017
Rym: Oh, that was so great when that happened because I didn't know I was watching the show.

719
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:54,593
Rym: and You know shows like this will have an opener with characters.

720
00:42:54,915 --> 00:42:56,100
Rym: most of those characters die.

721
00:42:56,421 --> 00:43:01,338
Scott: Then there's a new opener later with different characters right and it's like they were killing off characters left and right.

722
00:43:01,398 --> 00:43:09,212
Scott: and even though Aaron Was the main it's like at that point in the show Mikasa could have been the main as well Yeah, and it could have easily been like best friend dead early in the show.

723
00:43:09,272 --> 00:43:10,717
Scott: and now Mikasa is the main.

724
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:17,500
Rym: when he died I was like oh Yeah, this is awesome, and then with that Titan that kind of looked like him appeared.

725
00:43:18,043 --> 00:43:19,650
Rym: I didn't think it was him coming back.

726
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:27,399
Rym: I thought maybe it was something like oh Titan ate him and took on some of his aspects huh, maybe and then later is like oh, it's literally him.

727
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:31,600
Scott: yeah I figured when I saw that I knew it was him when they cut him out of the Titan.

728
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,424
Rym: I didn't expect that.

729
00:43:32,665 --> 00:43:43,620
Rym: and then when he wasn't wounded and was wearing different clothes That is when I started thinking back to the flash forward to the flashback, and I started worrying about time loops.

730
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,705
Rym: It's just a dream.

731
00:43:44,967 --> 00:43:47,378
Scott: Yeah, who knows who knows?

732
00:43:49,222 --> 00:43:52,186
Rym: Knows and some of the people who read the manga ahead I'm gonna.

733
00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:54,420
Scott: I'm gonna read it when you know the next volume comes out.

734
00:43:54,562 --> 00:44:01,800
Rym: There is a way They could Darryl Surratt calculated this based on the manga production rate and the rate at which the show covered the manga.

735
00:44:02,522 --> 00:44:11,611
Rym: they could do a 13 episode show next year like in the summer at the same pace of the current show and Then it's possible by 2015.

736
00:44:11,611 --> 00:44:13,939
Rym: They'd be able to do another 13 episode show.

737
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:20,560
Rym: They couldn't maybe do a 13 episode show and then do some OAVs of side material.

738
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:26,194
Scott: There was a material that was in the manga Which is you know in the part of the manga to the TV show covered?

739
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:27,500
Scott: It's not in the future, right?

740
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,893
Scott: So it's something you should know at this point, but you didn't.

741
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:34,420
Scott: because you watch a TV show There's a scene where they show in the past.

742
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:46,070
Scott: basically some soldier of the Survey Corps out in the wilderness is basically all alone and out of fuel and whatever and just walking and is writing in a journal and like a Titan approaches right.

743
00:44:46,772 --> 00:44:49,863
Scott: and the Titan comes and talks to this and is you know comes near this person.

744
00:44:49,883 --> 00:44:59,653
Scott: it's one of the mindless ones and The Titan like bows before this person and talks about like Lady Wymer Which is we all know the giant slain by Odin.

745
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:01,459
Scott: and is you know that they made the earth out of?

746
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,684
Rym: Well, you should know.

747
00:45:02,925 --> 00:45:05,535
Scott: right if you don't know what Wymer is what the mythology come on.

748
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:10,553
Scott: This is like mythology one Not even 101 just one you know anyway.

749
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:21,700
Scott: So and then the Titan eats the person but the journal is left there And then it shows you Levi and friends picking up the journal and it's like oh who is so-and-so?

750
00:45:21,881 --> 00:45:22,123
Scott: It's like.

751
00:45:22,143 --> 00:45:22,889
Scott: you know they're like.

752
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:24,280
Scott: oh so-and-so is dead.

753
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,389
Scott: This is what so-and-so died for and he's got the journal.

754
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:30,898
Scott: so you know Levi and the science lady and Erwin.

755
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:35,580
Scott: they know About that and I think there was like an OAV or direct to DVD.

756
00:45:35,741 --> 00:45:38,490
Scott: I think that was already made actually or something like.

757
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:41,080
Scott: that material was covered in animation somewhere.

758
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:44,240
Rym: I really like science lady.

759
00:45:45,123 --> 00:45:48,855
Rym: I think she is my favorite actual character because she is so crazy.

760
00:45:48,895 --> 00:45:50,480
Scott: favorite actual character.

761
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,593
Rym: It's be I like Erwin Levi and her the most.

762
00:45:54,075 --> 00:45:58,517
Rym: I like Mikasa a lot But Levi is sort of the king Cosmo.

763
00:45:58,638 --> 00:45:59,040
Rym: Oh my god.

764
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,390
Rym: Well, I like you know people Levi is he breaks the mold.

765
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:12,946
Rym: he's a mold breaker of that stone-cold consummate badass Because he's actually really emotional and sensitive and earnest and good And he's a great like.

766
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:25,860
Rym: the character is not as straightforward as it would appear Mm-hmm, and it's obvious that he's not as straightforward as it appears And it's obvious that he struggles with things and he's sad about things and that he has a really complex and deep personality.

767
00:46:26,464 --> 00:46:28,680
Rym: I like that about a stone-cold badass.

768
00:46:29,702 --> 00:46:31,900
Rym: Erwin is just the tactical badass.

769
00:46:32,744 --> 00:46:34,251
Scott: The show seems to really be pushing.

770
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:42,086
Scott: you know its literal message that it Says to you like 20 times which is yeah if you want to be able to change the world You just got to become an evil fucker.

771
00:46:42,106 --> 00:46:58,517
Rym: or maybe give up your humanity to you know Rock the boat not necessarily become evil, but become not necessarily But be willing to sacrifice great things and force other people against their will to make similar sacrifices.

772
00:46:58,597 --> 00:47:05,174
Rym: Yep Yeah, yeah, I think everyone's a Titan number pretty I'm kind of obvious.

773
00:47:05,896 --> 00:47:15,808
Rym: or maybe certain people are Titans Maybe the people in the walls, so there's this old SG 1 episode Stargate the TV show Which I like even though it's dumb and the.

774
00:47:15,868 --> 00:47:19,039
Rym: to summarize the episode the SG 1 team opens a Stargate.

775
00:47:19,341 --> 00:47:21,057
Rym: You know what the deal is that's g1 at all.

776
00:47:22,062 --> 00:47:22,204
Scott: It's.

777
00:47:22,284 --> 00:47:23,920
Scott: they have a Stargate and they go to places.

778
00:47:24,101 --> 00:47:26,128
Scott: It's sort of like sliders only in the Stargate.

779
00:47:26,148 --> 00:47:35,320
Rym: universe takes place after the Stargate movie and basically it's the researchers Messing around with the Stargate and they start plugging in other coordinates, and they start finding these gates everywhere.

780
00:47:36,164 --> 00:47:42,775
Rym: So they open a gate to one place and it's this besieged Citadel deep underground in a planet like Earth.

781
00:47:43,217 --> 00:47:48,212
Rym: and these people The outside world is waging a genocidal war against them and they're the last holdouts.

782
00:47:48,613 --> 00:47:50,699
Rym: So the Stargate people agree to help them.

783
00:47:51,562 --> 00:47:59,337
Rym: So they start piloting these remote robot drones helping them fight against this outside enemy That is clearly waging a war of genocide against them.

784
00:48:00,222 --> 00:48:03,613
Rym: Yada yada yada, it turns out they were the Nazis.

785
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,580
Rym: It's the Nazis last Citadel.

786
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,675
Rym: Yeah, the Nazis the people in this fortress are horrible people.

787
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:11,040
Rym: They all deserve to die.

788
00:48:11,462 --> 00:48:15,300
Rym: They are from within the Citadel trying to poison the atmosphere and kill everyone on the outside.

789
00:48:15,903 --> 00:48:18,599
Rym: And then the Stargate people like yeah, fuck you guys and they just leave.

790
00:48:19,669 --> 00:48:20,719
Rym: Leave them to die, right?

791
00:48:21,604 --> 00:48:24,199
Scott: And I feel like the royalty is the same thing.

792
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:27,289
Rym: Maybe possibly or maybe the whole city is just.

793
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:34,680
Rym: they've said the Titans are out there to kill everyone else in the world and They're supposed to hold out inside till everyone's gone, right?

794
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,807
Scott: And it's also the sort of obviousness of that.

795
00:48:36,888 --> 00:48:44,371
Scott: Titans are some sort of tool some sort of lost tool technology Like we lost our mecha technology the openers and closers all that.

796
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:47,720
Rym: now Shaka look in imagery exactly, right?

797
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,597
Scott: That's clearly the God Warriors.

798
00:48:49,657 --> 00:48:51,124
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it's like but how?

799
00:48:51,385 --> 00:48:56,260
Scott: the real question is not necessarily how do the Titans work or what their deal is.

800
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,445
Rym: Yeah, lightning bolt from the sky really what right.

801
00:48:58,726 --> 00:49:01,172
Scott: mom more curious about how?

802
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:04,200
Scott: what happened that made the technology lost?

803
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,906
Scott: That's the event not the event.

804
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:09,580
Scott: We're like, oh we invented Titan technology or we invented human technology.

805
00:49:09,702 --> 00:49:10,720
Scott: Yeah, we were right.

806
00:49:11,133 --> 00:49:19,100
Scott: but Well, how did you go from the world in which Titans were a tool that people could use for things to the world in which?

807
00:49:19,622 --> 00:49:24,519
Scott: people didn't even fucking know what the deal with Titans are except for maybe the king and other people we don't even know about.

808
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:29,357
Scott: and These walls were built and there was suddenly an inside and outside and no one remembers what happened.

809
00:49:29,397 --> 00:49:30,100
Scott: Big O style.

810
00:49:30,777 --> 00:49:37,120
Rym: No It seems like the the elites and the leaders know way more than we do and way more than the other characters do.

811
00:49:37,482 --> 00:49:38,910
Rym: But for whatever reason they don't say things.

812
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:39,694
Scott: because how did that?

813
00:49:39,915 --> 00:49:40,800
Scott: how did they know it?

814
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,044
Scott: And how did everyone else forget it?

815
00:49:42,084 --> 00:49:48,307
Rym: because notice how in certain crazy and how come his dad and Aaron's dad knows some normal characters Flip out about things that happen.

816
00:49:48,347 --> 00:49:51,439
Rym: but people in leadership positions kind of don't.

817
00:49:52,442 --> 00:49:53,685
Rym: They're like, it's a Titan.

818
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:55,971
Rym: It's this kind of Titan this kind of thing.

819
00:49:56,352 --> 00:49:56,953
Rym: Like they're more.

820
00:49:57,234 --> 00:50:04,113
Rym: they're surprisingly calm about things that Me watching the show would I would consider a major revelation about.

821
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:06,058
Scott: yeah, it's like we consider it's like it's.

822
00:50:06,098 --> 00:50:11,969
Scott: on the one hand We think it's cool that they're smart and that they just you know They're not doing dumb things like everyone knew.

823
00:50:12,029 --> 00:50:14,780
Scott: there could be you know an evil Titan among the ranks.

824
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:20,660
Rym: Well, wait, how the fuck did he know the idea that a human can turn into a Titan alone?

825
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,720
Rym: Should have been crazy except a lot of people didn't seem particularly surprised by that.

826
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,469
Rym: Yep, that is the one of the biggest triggers.

827
00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:30,452
Rym: that thing right there.

828
00:50:30,793 --> 00:50:33,704
Rym: when it turned out Aaron get her to a tight I was like, oh fuck.

829
00:50:33,945 --> 00:50:37,800
Rym: How are people gonna react to this and notice how the normal soldiers flip the fuck out?

830
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:49,980
Rym: Everybody else was like well he can turn into a Titan so we have to manage this As though Perhaps they have knowledge of people who can turn into Titans already or in right away is like there might be traders in the ranks.

831
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:55,435
Rym: He'd been planning to catch the traders who would be a traitor for the Titans, but a Titan.

832
00:50:55,736 --> 00:50:56,739
Rym: How do they know all this stuff?

833
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,753
Rym: Manga cow won't tell me in the mind the anime yet.

834
00:51:00,478 --> 00:51:00,860
Rym: I gotta wait.

835
00:51:02,381 --> 00:51:03,244
Rym: I'm not gonna read the manga.

836
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:06,275
Scott: I'm reading the officially published ones.

837
00:51:06,636 --> 00:51:09,530
Rym: I'm going to wait for Whatever happens with the anime.

838
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:10,435
Rym: It's popular enough.

839
00:51:10,475 --> 00:51:11,280
Rym: I think there will be more.

Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
