00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,748
Rym: It's Thursday August 22nd 2013.

2
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:18,311
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight, Australia part dude.

3
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:21,123
Scott: It's not fresh.

4
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:25,858
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:31,760
Rym: I'm feeling a lot more energy now that we've been back from Australia for a while.

6
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:43,160
Scott: I'm feeling pretty good energy today because when I biked to work this morning in New York the things we talked about biking in New It was gonna rain and I got it only rained a block away from the office and I got in the office.

7
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:46,997
Scott: So I barely got rained on and then it was raining all day until I was leaving work.

8
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:47,680
Scott: The Sun came out.

9
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,350
Rym: So I know I know I was good.

10
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,275
Rym: I went to work right.

11
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:50,980
Rym: take that rain.

12
00:00:51,322 --> 00:00:52,951
Rym: I was like I should bike.

13
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:54,560
Rym: look how nice it is outside.

14
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,272
Rym: But I had some other stuff had to take care of.

15
00:00:57,312 --> 00:00:59,799
Rym: so I didn't want my bike at the office cuz I had to come back home anyway.

16
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:06,420
Rym: So I didn't bike and then I got to the office and because of the timing it would have rained on me.

17
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:08,719
Rym: Had I biked at the time I would have left.

18
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:12,840
Scott: So on top of that I'm waiting for my new shower head to come because my previous one broke.

19
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,943
Rym: You didn't buy a water pick.

20
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:14,264
Rym: Did you?

21
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:16,853
Scott: I bought the top rated one in Amazon?

22
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:17,876
Rym: Oh, okay.

23
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:19,020
Rym: Well, was it a water pick?

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,766
Rym: I'm really not feeling the water.

25
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:22,814
Scott: Let me see what it is water picks.

26
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:25,805
Scott: It's basically the same kind of thing We've always gotten.

27
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:29,780
Scott: oh, you know, it's a plastic shower head with you twist it in his mode.

28
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:30,883
Rym: Ah, but so what I've?

29
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:39,991
Rym: I did a lot of research into shower heads because I replaced my water pick with a different brand Not as commonly known brand as a Delta 75 700 WH 7 spray.

30
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:47,260
Rym: I know that one because that one was actually one of the ones I looked at because it is born in the top rated.

31
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:51,992
Scott: It has four and a half stars in Amazon after 491 reviews, that's a lot.

32
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:52,980
Rym: I looked at that one.

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,075
Rym: I ended up getting this dual head one, but now I thought about getting one of those.

34
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:56,900
Scott: They're way more money.

35
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:58,366
Rym: Uh, yeah, so I got a dual head one.

36
00:01:58,387 --> 00:01:59,331
Rym: That was only 60 bucks.

37
00:01:59,713 --> 00:02:00,135
Scott: That's the way.

38
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:01,220
Scott: that's way more money.

39
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:06,796
Scott: this one is only costing me I. I forget it doesn't have the price right now.

40
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:10,631
Rym: Yeah, you're gonna feel really silly if you use my show.

41
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,441
Rym: 20 20 26 how absolutely fantastic my show It is.

42
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:16,654
Scott: I want to talk about not how fantastic good shower heads are but how shitty.

43
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:18,884
Scott: I reverted to the shower head that came With my apartment.

44
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:19,869
Rym: Oh, yeah, you want to get me started?

45
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,960
Rym: I got something to say about that because it's broken.

46
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,170
Scott: I reverted to the shower head that came with my apartment.

47
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:26,420
Scott: low flow does not even begin.

48
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:29,940
Scott: I would have more coming down on me if I went outside in a drizzle.

49
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:34,219
Scott: It's like there's two lasers of water that are like sort of going in.

50
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:37,632
Scott: It's like it's like a baby is peeing on me and that's it.

51
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:39,640
Rym: No, that's it simultaneously.

52
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,088
Scott: How can I clean myself with that if anyone out there?

53
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:45,660
Rym: if you take the ad the sort of legal flow limiter out of your?

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,900
Rym: Shower head you're kind of a dick because I don't think you understand how much fucking water you waste if you take that out.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,300
Scott: But I used to take it out to increase the flow.

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,764
Scott: But then I realized like oh if you have a better shower head you can leave it in and still get the flow Exactly.

57
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:02,013
Rym: If you take it will remember and then you won't waste water.

58
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:02,977
Rym: We moved a beacon.

59
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:04,644
Rym: We were like, hey Let's take it out.

60
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,440
Rym: We took it out and then we're like, oh one shower empties the hot water heater.

61
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,247
Rym: That's stupid.

62
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:17,100
Rym: and we put the flow limiter back Because we were used to RIT where the water pressure was just low and that's when you're supposed to take it out.

63
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:23,128
Rym: If the water pressure is low if it's high like in New York Imagine just turning on the faucet.

64
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:23,911
Rym: Just letting it go.

65
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:25,538
Rym: Just bam open faucet.

66
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:31,980
Rym: Yeah But What the fuck is up with anyone who has lived in a place for?

67
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:39,480
Rym: More than a month and has not replaced the default shower head with one that is on Some sort of rope or chain mechanism?

68
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:46,228
Scott: Maybe they live in some sort of luxury place that has an awesome shower head or maybe High-end showers that just blast you from all sides.

69
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:47,130
Scott: It has like electronic.

70
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:50,380
Rym: Yeah, but seriously, how do you wash your asshole?

71
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:59,140
Rym: Effectively if you don't have the kind you can pick up and hold down by your asshole Maybe they just bend over and show their asshole to the sky.

72
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,340
Rym: I mean, I understand I think it's a health related thing in hotels because people might put it in place.

73
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:06,346
Rym: They shouldn't put it.

74
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:11,189
Rym: So I'm kind of okay with that though I note every country I travel to that isn't the u.s.

75
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,818
Rym: It has the same kind of shower head Rym.

76
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:14,440
Scott: think about this.

77
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,036
Scott: Until those things weren't fucking invented until till when what where what year.

78
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:22,180
Scott: they didn't have those.

79
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,894
Scott: They had those my entire life, right, but I'm talking like in the 50s.

80
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:26,617
Scott: you think they had those.

81
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:28,269
Scott: probably I don't know.

82
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:29,400
Scott: you ever see one in an old movie.

83
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:32,499
Rym: How often do you see the inside of a shower in an old movie?

84
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,551
Rym: Psycho, yeah, I was gonna say name another movie.

85
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:36,878
Scott: So I couldn't have one.

86
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,003
Scott: Yeah I'm just.

87
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:38,726
Scott: I'm just telling you that.

88
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:45,731
Rym: but I guess I just don't get humans who live in a place Where they don't get a real shower head.

89
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,657
Rym: It's like dude 20 bucks.

90
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:49,945
Scott: It is 20 bucks.

91
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:50,988
Rym: 20 bucks for one.

92
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:53,416
Rym: that is a thousand times better than what you've got.

93
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:54,460
Scott: seven modes.

94
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:57,408
Rym: Mine only has three modes and two heads.

95
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:02,769
Rym: now if I turn on two heads at the same time, that's stupid That's that's gonna waste so much water.

96
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:05,240
Rym: dumb dumb, but the way mine set up, right?

97
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:10,180
Rym: I have a head that's fixed up there that actually has a really good sort of angle mechanism.

98
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,512
Rym: So I can get it like angled perfectly and then I have the one I hold.

99
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:16,384
Rym: I can switch between them the way It's set up.

100
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:22,235
Rym: the angle one that's fixed Uses way little water, but it gives me this nice spray.

101
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:23,420
Rym: So it's keeping me warm.

102
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:31,151
Rym: It's doing the basic washing but then I take the stick one and switch to that and it's basically It's basically super powerful asshole cleaner.

103
00:05:31,352 --> 00:05:33,580
Rym: Sure, but the key is it's super powerful.

104
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:34,600
Rym: So it wastes water.

105
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:47,606
Rym: But I only use it for like a minute in my entire shower and the rest of the time I'm standing there with the normal one Using way little water and not getting cold cuz I'm like soaping up my stuff Mmm.

106
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,718
Rym: Yeah shower heads.

107
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:53,970
Rym: We should do a whole show on sour shower heads Okay, so yeah, that's not a bad idea.

108
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,774
Rym: That's a pretty good show.

109
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:55,839
Scott: ideas already already done.

110
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,887
Rym: it We've done have we?

111
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,258
Scott: we just did it right now.

112
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:01,933
Rym: now I got a lot more to say that I'm holding back low flow Jerry.

113
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:03,720
Scott: Okay, so I got some news here.

114
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,219
Scott: It's just a tiny gaming news, right?

115
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,242
Scott: But there's.

116
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:14,240
Scott: the Elder Scrolls online has been an MMO people are looking forward to right up maybe because you know MMOs are waning so and not too often a big one comes along.

117
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,700
Scott: So, of course one based on the sky rims and oblivions and the Maro wins is gonna be pretty hot, right?

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,813
Scott: Yeah, so they decided to charge 15 bucks a month, which is a lot Right, but people are crazy for this fucking thing.

119
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,396
Scott: So they'll pay it.

120
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:38,400
Scott: Well, I Know it's a month for Counter-Strike and they know that this thing is going free-to-play Eventually, so they're basically they're clearly gonna milk everyone for what they're worth and then go free-to-play, right?

121
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,224
Scott: Here's the.

122
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:40,289
Scott: here's the real catch.

123
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,696
Scott: here's the real cat.

124
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:52,500
Scott: there's a catch They're gonna put in the free-to-play buy stuff store to buy, you know in-game shit at the same time That it's still 15 bucks a month.

125
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,686
Scott: So you pay 15 bucks a month and you pay to win and then eventually when it's free to play It'll just be paid away.

126
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:00,334
Scott: All right without the monthly fee.

127
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:14,398
Scott: Listen assholes Thing you're paying 15 bucks a month to get nothing and then you buy a sword in the store with real money again, I Understand why the industry is going in this direction, but I also hate it.

128
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:15,905
Rym: I don't know what.

129
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:19,640
Scott: you don't catch me playing this even Counter-Strike right my pure game.

130
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,892
Rym: They added drops and they added you can get a I guess an mp5.

131
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:26,740
Rym: that's orange and it looks to everybody.

132
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,150
Rym: but The you know what they added, you know what.

133
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,844
Rym: two of the items are the Silenced m4.

134
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:35,049
Scott: Wait, you have to pay for that.

135
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,560
Rym: Well you everyone got it for free, but it's an item.

136
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:40,010
Scott: Okay, an optional item.

137
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,479
Scott: So there are people who won't have it.

138
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:44,040
Rym: I don't know if anyone will not have it.

139
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,116
Rym: Like if I buy the game today, I wonder if I get it or not and the silenced USP.

140
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:50,140
Scott: Does everyone have that?

141
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,125
Rym: Everyone who's currently playing.

142
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:55,940
Scott: Well, I mean you don't just have it you have to buy it with in-game no strike dollars, right?

143
00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:56,784
Rym: It's what?

144
00:07:56,824 --> 00:08:05,387
Rym: will you get it for free I guess cuz it was like the first item like, you know It's like you have it available to purchase like I have Kevlar available to purchase But I don't know.

145
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:08,020
Rym: I haven't tried it yet because I've been too busy since packed.

146
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:12,675
Rym: But I think you have to equip it outside of the game instead of your regular m4.

147
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:15,645
Scott: Oh Fuck that bull.

148
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:16,066
Scott: Yeah.

149
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:20,100
Rym: Yeah, I have not played Counter-Strike since they announced their crate bullshit.

150
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,120
Scott: I mean, it's one thing if I can press B and then choose between the two and one cost more or something.

151
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,123
Rym: Well, this is why I'm worried because when kind of one round I want one and one round I want the other.

152
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:30,670
Rym: when Counter-Strike go came out.

153
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:34,083
Rym: It was great and I had literally One complaint.

154
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:39,380
Rym: and that one complaint was how come my m4 and USP don't have silencers?

155
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,116
Rym: And then when those were added through the steam bullshit item bullshit bullshit.

156
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,540
Rym: That's bullshit.

157
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,542
Scott: NS2.

158
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:55,737
Rym: Yeah, but I like you know, I like NS2 I like Counter-Strike more.

159
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:56,580
Rym: that's my game.

160
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:07,773
Rym: well, that's a problem and I have to keep a close eye on this because if this gets out of hand one I'm just gonna have to Sit down and edit my servers such that it's the way I want it to be.

161
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:21,820
Rym: at least dota only has to its credit only has And make using these items a bannable offense, but more importantly might just have to go back to one six one six At least one game that never dies.

162
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:33,100
Scott: You know one six is kind of awesome in that like people don't play quake one really but you can go back and play One six which is you know, I think it's partly because one six was one of those games that still kind of worked on the internet.

163
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:35,186
Rym: Yeah, I mean quick one.

164
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:36,851
Rym: You got to know IP addresses.

165
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:39,600
Rym: Yeah, like what's the IP address of this server?

166
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,660
Rym: You want to connect just to wrap up this gaming news?

167
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:49,793
Scott: I do want to say I'm thinking about trying the new ever quest only because it seems to be a combo MMO Minecraft and just the idea of that seems cool.

168
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:51,280
Scott: So I might go for the free trial on it.

169
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:54,555
Rym: I'm going to wait until you bite that bullet.

170
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,560
Rym: It's a free trial.

171
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,160
Scott: It's gonna take me like an hour to figure out if it's worthwhile.

172
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,420
Scott: Most of that hour will be spent downloading.

173
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,100
Rym: I spent money in Leviathan warships because no one seemed to know if it was bullshit or glad I did not spend money on that.

174
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:08,785
Rym: Yep, that's the show.

175
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:09,588
Rym: We keep forgetting to do.

176
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:20,900
Rym: we got a review Mario Tennis and all those 3ds games the way we want games Because they're not no one reviews the news over there, uh, so I got it, you know, it's Thursday, it's the lounge.

177
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:21,726
Scott: No, that's your mom.

178
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:22,834
Rym: We can talk about whatever we want.

179
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:30,659
Rym: So one We live in New York If you can't tell no from listening to GeekNights and we have a big mayoral election coming up.

180
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:33,845
Scott: So yeah We can actually vote an election.

181
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:39,279
Scott: that matters where the votes are counted mostly honestly and the votes are close and it's not.

182
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:46,740
Rym: And because the Republicans just don't matter here because they don't the primaries are all that matter.

183
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:55,000
Rym: so as a result It's not like I have to choose between a gennaro right-of-center Democrat and an ultra right-wing or ultra religious Republican.

184
00:10:55,401 --> 00:11:01,180
Rym: I get to choose between two or three Democrats all of whom have slightly nuanced positions on things.

185
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:03,600
Rym: So it actually kind of matters.

186
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:12,646
Rym: so a lot of our listeners do live in New York and if you're not paying attention to the Local elections where you live That's why your shit sucks.

187
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:16,119
Scott: that shit matters a lot a lot more to your day-to-day life.

188
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,239
Scott: Then my current election my current City Council person vologna who is good and bad, right?

189
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:31,540
Scott: He's responsible for the gentrification of my neighborhood, but also other things which not so good But anyway, he is trying to become the Queen's borough president.

190
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:35,980
Scott: So there's all these people like trying to run to like take his spot if he wins or whatever.

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,380
Scott: It kind of matters.

192
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,140
Scott: For me at least yeah.

193
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:43,613
Rym: But pay attention because Bloomberg is on his way out and there's been the firing.

194
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:46,805
Rym: the mayor's office of New York has been kind of Funny lately because

195
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:47,690
Scott: I just run for mayor

196
00:11:48,032 --> 00:12:03,690
Rym: racist stop-and-frisk thing And basically the New York mayor's office has been having hissy fits on Twitter like the City Council basically shut down their racist stop-and-search policy where they'd go to neighborhoods and Stop black people and see if they had guns.

197
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:06,400
Rym: and they say that yeah, we found a bunch of guns.

198
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,603
Rym: We're stopping crime, even though they don't citation Cystic show.

199
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:19,144
Rym: crime going down after stuff is right, but the City Council was like, alright, we passed some laws You can't do this anymore.

200
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:24,860
Rym: Yeah, and the mayor was like veto and the City Council was like, yeah over Roger veto.

201
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,889
Scott: That's how democracy works.

202
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:29,340
Scott: Yes, it works only in this tiny area.

203
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,260
Rym: But listen, this is New York.

204
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,086
Rym: Do you know how many people live here?

205
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:36,880
Rym: and yet still are my individual piddly little vote?

206
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,350
Rym: Actually statistically significant.

207
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:41,080
Scott: Yep, because not everyone votes.

208
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,795
Rym: What about all of you who live in like, I don't know.

209
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:48,398
Scott: Gary, Indiana How many people vote is not you know, and Gary, Indiana, I read a story.

210
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,949
Rym: actually There's been a bunch of stories about Gary so poor.

211
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:53,700
Scott: they sold a bunch of houses for really one dollar.

212
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,853
Scott: Ice cold keep piece of shit.

213
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:57,740
Scott: house one dollar.

214
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,080
Rym: Yeah, those houses were only available to people who lived there already in the area.

215
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:10,956
Rym: I would have bought all twelve or twelve bucks make a minimum income of like $35,000 a year and they have to live in the house for five years or they lose it not doing it.

216
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:11,397
Rym: Yeah.

217
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:12,340
Rym: No one's doing it.

218
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:15,620
Rym: But Gary's been in the news a lot for a lot of reasons.

219
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,920
Rym: But if you live in a place like that, how many people do you think vote for like the comptroller?

220
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:24,033
Rym: Like how many people do you think vote in that?

221
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:29,814
Rym: they go to the place they vote They look at a list of names of people who want to be the comptroller and they pick one.

222
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:31,580
Scott: your vote matters a fuck ton.

223
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:35,329
Rym: So I got one other cool thing is this Thursday.

224
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,657
Rym: well, not really cool kind of sad but also cool.

225
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:40,085
Rym: so The Nuremberg trials.

226
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,890
Scott: what you got winning this show?

227
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,240
Rym: It's not even half over, you know, the trials were we.

228
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:48,208
Scott: What does this have anything to do with August 22nd 2013?

229
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:52,120
Rym: the victors of the of the of the Second World War?

230
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:59,235
Rym: took all the Nazis and Tried them for crimes against humanity and executed a whole bunch of them on August 22nd.

231
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:00,960
Rym: No now it's not the anniversary.

232
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:01,665
Scott: How is this?

233
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,560
Scott: how is this relevant to anything in any way?

234
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,883
Scott: Why bring this up randomly?

235
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:10,580
Rym: because there is something that you all might not know about the Nuremberg trials, right?

236
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,409
Scott: But how is it relevant to today or now?

237
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:14,520
Rym: It's not it's just Thursday bringing random.

238
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:17,759
Scott: I'm bringing up a cool random history fact up from Rym.

239
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:25,500
Rym: Well, because I kind of I kind of ran through the course of my Civil War interest lately and I got back into World War II.

240
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:29,530
Rym: uh-huh, so Here is the cool thing.

241
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:31,280
Rym: You did not know about the Nuremberg trials.

242
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:39,047
Rym: They were basically the first time in history that modern simultaneous Translation was used anywhere.

243
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:39,890
Scott: Okay.

244
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:42,860
Rym: This was the first time IBM set up all these systems.

245
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:44,405
Rym: You know the UN all?

246
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:49,139
Scott: yeah, they took all the ones they used to count the dead Jews with and they reprogram them.

247
00:14:51,283 --> 00:15:02,139
Rym: But you know the idea like we think oh a big court trial or a big, you know Anytime there's a thing going on in the United Nations Everyone's got those earpieces in and there's simultaneous translation and things like that.

248
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:05,512
Rym: that did not exist until the Nuremberg trials.

249
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:16,440
Rym: that had never been done before and It caused nervous breakdowns in the people doing the translation Because no one had ever been trained to do that before.

250
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:24,060
Rym: There was no school of here is how to listen to someone speaking in German and and talk English at someone else back and forth.

251
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:26,599
Rym: That shit's actually really hard to do.

252
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:39,769
Rym: No, and the whole field of study and the profession of simultaneous translation like we do today basically began with the Nuremberg trials And I thought that was a cool interesting history fact.

253
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,376
Scott: come random history fact from Rym.

254
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:42,340
Scott: That's your new segment Rym.

255
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:45,664
Scott: No, I'd be random Unrelevant unrelated to anything.

256
00:15:45,684 --> 00:15:46,326
Scott: history fact.

257
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:50,417
Rym: that hereby is what I'm gonna do on every lounge show from now on.

258
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:54,580
Rym: the random history fact The history minute is nothing to do with anything rims history minute.

259
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:54,982
Scott: It can't.

260
00:15:55,022 --> 00:16:02,492
Scott: if it's relevant to the day or time or any recent event in any way and allowed to do it It has to be completely unrelated to anything that's going on.

261
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:12,665
Rym: Well, actually this one is completely relevant to Things of the day.

262
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:13,849
Rym: Yes it is.

263
00:16:15,193 --> 00:16:23,060
Rym: So this is a CollegeHumor video And I found pretty hilarious and I haven't linked to CollegeHumor in a while, so here's the deal.

264
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,867
Scott: I haven't gone to CollegeHumor in a while.

265
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:26,413
Rym: I still go because you know what it is.

266
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:38,485
Rym: a gold mine of great videos It is but it's a good filter if you Want to see funny videos on the internet to be perfectly honest and you don't want to spend a lot of your time Trolling for them on the internet.

267
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:43,780
Rym: CollegeHumor's video feed is actually a pretty good subset of all the worthwhile videos.

268
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,279
Scott: They have people there who gets videos submitted to them and their job is they see watch them all and pick out good ones.

269
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,411
Scott: So shitty job, but someone does it.

270
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,522
Rym: this is a short skit We're in.

271
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:59,320
Rym: someone finds out by going through his attic that I guess his grandpa's a big fan of Wolfenstein.

272
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:02,739
Scott: I'm a big fan of Wolfenstein.

273
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,328
Rym: Yeah, well apparently that look at not the way is.

274
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:05,729
Rym: well.

275
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:07,655
Rym: this guy grandpa was really into this.

276
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:09,200
Rym: look at all these autographed books.

277
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:10,717
Rym: Oh my god cosplay.

278
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:12,862
Rym: Great.

279
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:17,260
Rym: what's this picture of people hanging out with the final a guy dressed as the final boss from Wolfenstein?

280
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,611
Scott: I like how grandpa is peepa.

281
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,242
Rym: It's a good video.

282
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:27,380
Rym: you should watch it and then think about the tragedy of World War two and the Nuremberg trials.

283
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:32,080
Scott: So here is the thing of the day that is getting away from God Godwin's law.

284
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:43,452
Scott: This is a blowback rubber band gun shaped like a desert eagle It doesn't say replica down the side of it even though that's what it is.

285
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,617
Scott: it's made of wood.

286
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:45,420
Scott: it's amazing.

287
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,745
Scott: I would pay monies for this.

288
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:50,820
Scott: it shoots rubber bands and it also has these little wooden shells that shoot out the side.

289
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:53,419
Scott: It's reduced amazing all over the place.

290
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:54,443
Rym: That's the kind of thing.

291
00:17:54,464 --> 00:18:02,140
Scott: if you look at the side of YouTube you can see as a whole geekery of making guns rubberband guns that look like real guns and function like real guns.

292
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,239
Scott: But this one I think is the current best of that.

293
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,839
Rym: That's the kind of thing that I would like to have on a little stand on my desk.

294
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:10,265
Scott: Yeah, kind of thing.

295
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:11,433
Scott: I wouldn't bring to the airport.

296
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:19,528
Rym: Yeah Yeah, it doesn't have an orange tip, okay We're gonna be at pecs prime.

297
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:22,360
Scott: that's pretty much all that fucking matters right next weekend.

298
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:25,068
Scott: Oh shit on Thursday.

299
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:34,476

00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:48,749
Rym: Apparently.

327
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:50,194
Scott: I don't know about that guys.

328
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:51,720
Rym: You got to get mad.

329
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,605
Rym: Seriously, Stasi land is a pretty.

330
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:54,648
Rym: it's the book club book.

331
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:58,980
Rym: It's pretty good has a few flaws, but there's this one story in it.

332
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,950
Rym: I'm gonna try to sell you guys actually reading this book.

333
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:02,920
Rym: Basically this guy worked for the Stasi.

334
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:09,120
Rym: He was like a low-level function area And he had his like department had won this like bullshit award.

335
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,540
Rym: So I had this plate on the wall this plastic place that Stasi and the plate was like, you know best department something something.

336
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,410
Rym: I forget the details.

337
00:20:17,037 --> 00:20:23,319
Rym: So Eventually, he was kicked out of that office for insubordination Good job.

338
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:36,704
Rym: and as he left he was sitting in the office ready to leave and he was like I Fucking stole it.

339
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:48,420
Rym: Yeah, and that's when the Stasi and the GDR instituted the I think stolen plate recovery Initiative and sent agents to track him and try to find the plate that he hid somewhere.

340
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:54,670
Rym: And the story goes on from there And that guy there's at the very end.

341
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,836
Rym: He's like like having that plate.

342
00:20:56,896 --> 00:21:00,245
Rym: He has the plate to this day Yeah And he is like.

343
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:03,975
Rym: this is the symbol of everything that I fought for.

344
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:05,780
Scott: that plate should be in a museum.

345
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:14,415
Rym: Well, it's in his house now and I feel like he deserves to keep it in his house till he dies of old age And then it's going into museums or maybe they'll bury him with it.

Rym: It's pretty cool.

371
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:17,164
Rym: stuff happens in there Australia.

372
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:19,074
Rym: cuz we didn't quite finish talking about.

373
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:23,230
Scott: we were there a long time To say we only said a show's worth.

374
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:29,136
Scott: so we got maybe another almost shows worth to say Yep, cuz you know, but I forget what we already said.

375
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:31,649
Scott: So Rym Please go down the list of notes.

376
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:33,920
Scott: We made about things we did but did not talk about.

377
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:38,100
Rym: Alright, so the biggest thing that I can say that happened is we went biking.

378
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:42,080
Rym: Oh, right, so we decide, you know, cuz Emily and I did this a while ago.

379
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,919
Rym: We went to Japan for a power and we stayed in Nagoya, which is kind of a chill.

380
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:51,591
Rym: Not it's not like the kind of city you think tourists would go to.

381
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:53,860
Scott: someone said it was the Philadelphia of Japan.

382
00:22:54,463 --> 00:22:56,718
Rym: I've heard a lot of people say it's the Chicago of Japan.

383
00:22:56,778 --> 00:22:58,627
Scott: sure But it's what do I know?

384
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:00,536
Rym: a chill place and Emily went to school there.

385
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:01,380
Rym: So we're like, hey, let's go.

386
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:09,087
Rym: So we stayed there for a few days and we rented bikes one day and bike just all around the city like everywhere We went like this is a pan mad hilly.

387
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:10,170
Rym: Uh, yeah.

388
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:12,457
Rym: Yeah, and I can bike.

389
00:23:12,477 --> 00:23:14,453
Rym: I'm just saying yeah There's no trouble at all.

390
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:20,540
Rym: Biking was difficult there though, partly because everyone bikes super slow and bikes on the sidewalk with terrible bikes and the bikes are shitty.

391
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,779
Rym: Yeah, yeah, we saw a few cool people biking in the street with real bikes, but we could not rent real bikes.

392
00:23:26,982 --> 00:23:28,768
Rym: Kind of like we couldn't rent real bikes in Melbourne.

393
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:38,179
Rym: Well, so we decided we were going to rent bikes One of the days and just bike around Melbourne all day and like biked up and down the coast because the coast is right there.

394
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:43,399
Rym: So we tried to find a place to rent bikes and it was actually kind of hard.

395
00:23:43,942 --> 00:23:47,000
Scott: They have the city bike equivalent the bike share program.

396
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,396
Rym: It's the exact same physical bikes that we have in New York with city bike.

397
00:23:51,737 --> 00:23:52,580
Scott: It's a system.

398
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,126
Scott: It's just a way cheaper and be.

399
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:59,220
Scott: helmets are mandatory, but they just sell helmets fucking everywhere for five bucks.

400
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:07,002
Scott: Yep, there's like a Melbourne City helmet You can buy for five bucks to any 7-eleven and people just like leave these things on some of the bikes because they don't give A shit.

401
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:07,827
Rym: Yep.

402
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:08,873
Rym: So it's cool.

403
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:09,999
Rym: Look at the difference in New York.

404
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:38,180
Rym: The argument was we don't have a helmet law in general for bikes and the argument was that we shouldn't because studies show that when there's a helmet law people bike way less like way less and Statistically supposedly the average rate of deaths due to obesity When people are not active is worse than the average rate of deaths due to people not wearing helmets when biking Adults not children and we do have laws about children having to wear helmets.

405
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:47,075
Scott: One person did finally give me though a good argument for why there should be a helmet law because my opinion is basically look Breaks you could kill someone else if you don't have breaks.

406
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:50,400
Scott: Yep, but a helmet It's like if you want to kill yourself be my guess.

407
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,440
Scott: It doesn't hurt me if you have no helmet and the guy was like well when you have socialized medicines, right?

408
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,305
Scott: Not only I've heard that argument It was a second argument.

409
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:02,680
Scott: Not only can it cost other people if you get hurt more, right?

410
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,197
Scott: But let's say a driver hits you right?

411
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:09,992
Scott: Well, if you were wearing a helmet, maybe you only you know break some bones.

412
00:25:10,013 --> 00:25:15,980
Scott: another driver is responsible for hurting you But if you don't have a helmet and you die now the driver is responsible for manslaughter.

413
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,970
Scott: Ah, so you're hurting that driver.

414
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:20,120
Scott: here driver didn't do anything differently.

415
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:22,771
Scott: He hit you but because you weren't wearing a helmet.

416
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:32,471
Scott: the consequence is more severe Even though the driver did the exact same drive mistake, but it is not the victims Responsibility to protect himself from crime.

417
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:33,697
Scott: No, it's not.

418
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,600
Rym: and Pretty much all the time when a car hits a bike pretty much the cars fault.

419
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:41,645
Scott: New York is 50/50.

420
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:43,851
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is like.

421
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:49,138
Rym: I read a lot of the reports of like when there are bike incidents in the city is something I just follow because I'm

422
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:52,363
Scott: It's pretty important

423
00:25:52,804 --> 00:26:01,430
Rym: but a lot of them end up being road rage or things like that As opposed to biker ran a red light and got hit.

424
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:04,040
Rym: it's often car ran a biker off the road.

425
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:06,266
Rym: Hmm, but I digress the.

426
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:12,051
Rym: what about the the eggshell thing that if you punch a dude and he just happens to be mad That's what it is.

427
00:26:12,273 --> 00:26:12,819
Scott: That's what it is.

428
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:16,572
Rym: And though in the u.s The rationale is fuck you you committed a crime.

429
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:20,519
Rym: if the consequences were worse than you expected You shouldn't have committed that crime in the first place.

430
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:21,462
Rym: You were.

431
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:29,747
Rym: you should have been aware that as soon as you do something dangerous or stupid the consequences could be unlimited Depending on circumstance.

432
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,377
Scott: I think I just tapped a guy on the shoulder and he died.

433
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:32,960
Scott: What the fuck?

434
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,400
Rym: Yep, ah, but were you tapping him with intent to injure?

435
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:39,245
Rym: No, then it does.

436
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:40,790
Rym: that rule usually doesn't apply.

437
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:48,416
Rym: Okay, whatever anyway, but in Melbourne They have a helmet law but helmets are super cheap because they're subsidized by the government in New York.

438
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:49,500
Rym: There's no helmet law.

439
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,240
Scott: There are actually free helmets you can get but it's a little tricky to get them.

440
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,070
Scott: They're not just in every store in bundles.

441
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:58,048
Rym: Yeah, and honestly I don't wear a helmet.

442
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:03,011
Rym: often when I take a city bike in a very short trip I don't see anyone wearing a helmet on the city bike.

443
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:04,900
Scott: I only see you wearing helmets who have other bikes.

444
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:07,480
Rym: I'd say half the people I see on city bikes are wearing helmets.

445
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,829
Scott: I almost never see a city bike rider with a helmet.

446
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,813
Rym: the city bike people.

447
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,480
Rym: that's because you're in tourist town where you work.

448
00:27:12,861 --> 00:27:17,700
Scott: Where I am the people who are riding those bike city bikes are people commuting to tourist town who also work there.

449
00:27:18,063 --> 00:27:26,227
Rym: Most of the people I see downtown are commuters and people using them to go out to lunch like to go to the good food truck and back and they About half of them have helmets.

450
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,257
Rym: the ones who don't have helmets are the tourists.

451
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:39,040
Rym: Mm-hmm but apparently all the traditional bike rental places Went out of business pretty much as soon as their equivalent of city bike was put in place.

452
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:49,575
Scott: Yeah, all the New York people all the New York bike shops are we're like We're gonna go out of business when the you know We can't rent any bikes because the city bike is gonna make you know, kill our rental business And you know what it turns out.

453
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:52,908
Scott: that's true But bikes there's so much biking there.

454
00:27:53,008 --> 00:27:57,520
Scott: in general bike shops didn't have rental businesses anymore, but they call bike shops.

455
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,500
Scott: They were still plenty of bike shops making plenty of money because there was so much biking going on.

456
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,640
Rym: So it really only hurt the bike rental industry.

457
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:08,290
Scott: It didn't hurt the bike shops in general because they made.

458
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:13,351
Scott: they did indeed still make plenty of money Doing other things besides renting bike.

459
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:16,246
Rym: we were talking to the guy at a shop really Hey, can we order a bike?

460
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:16,791
Rym: and he's like hell.

461
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:17,900
Rym: no, why would I rent bikes?

462
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:28,693
Rym: yeah, but there's a chance that actually bike shops are doing better because more people start biking because of these programs and Then they go buy a bike and and a better helmet than the $5 shit.

463
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:30,640
Rym: Yep, and also city bikes suck.

464
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:33,776
Rym: So if you like biking you're gonna eventually buy a real bike for $100 a year.

465
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:43,760
Rym: A real bike will pay for itself very quickly compared to city bike Anyway, but it was really interesting that it did in fact destroy the bike rental industry and I have zero sympathy.

466
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:45,829
Scott: Yeah, so so we wanted to get so.

467
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:48,460
Scott: you didn't want to get the city bike equivalent because it's a pain in the ass.

468
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:49,840
Scott: Well, it would be shitty.

469
00:28:50,145 --> 00:29:00,960
Rym: They would have been great If our intent was to use them to go from place to place in the major downtown area like go to the museum on the Bike go to a restaurant on the bike go to a museum on the bike.

470
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,899
Rym: But no we wanted to bike like fucking down the coast.

471
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:08,919
Scott: Wanted to go to where the Grand Prix track was, you know, which because it's they.

472
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:11,492
Scott: you know It's a road course where they have the Australian Grand Prix.

473
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:16,111
Scott: So it's like well, it's just roads But the same roads f1 cars go on but you're basically biking.

474
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:18,400
Rym: we wanted to bike way out into places like New York.

475
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,428
Scott: How cool would that be to bike around the f1 track?

476
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:22,134
Scott: That's just currently normal roads.

477
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:23,620
Scott: Yeah, it's not currently an f1 track.

478
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,615
Rym: So we needed real bikes to do this because it's gonna be an all-day thing.

479
00:29:26,636 --> 00:29:32,500
Rym: somewhat real bikes Yes, and we found a tourist place that still they rented out like date bikes like 40 bucks.

480
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:35,230
Rym: Here's a mountain bike for a day perfectly serviceable.

481
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,238
Rym: Yeah, not great, but not terrible work.

482
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:37,720
Scott: It worked.

483
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,088
Scott: It was a you know, the low bar step through.

484
00:29:40,148 --> 00:29:42,195
Scott: I was like, you know, it went.

485
00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:45,707
Scott: it had gears which you know The city bike thing only had three in a hub year.

486
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:46,550
Scott: This had real gears.

487
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:52,404
Rym: now the bike guy saved us from First catastrophe because we're about to leave.

488
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:57,723
Rym: she's like wait wait wait Americans right and we're like, yep, and he's like Front brakes on the right.

489
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:04,670
Scott: and we're like, wow Yeah, they had you know, the walking on the left the driving on the left the switching of the brakes.

490
00:30:05,212 --> 00:30:06,359
Scott: But they didn't switch the gears.

491
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,168
Scott: the gears switching was still the same.

492
00:30:08,189 --> 00:30:11,221
Scott: Yep But the brakes it's like the right hand brake brakes the front.

493
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:19,143
Rym: if he had not told me that I might have had some trouble I might have hurt myself Early, yeah, cuz we got right away around these hills.

494
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:20,489
Rym: I'm like up wrong brake up.

495
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,220
Scott: So we get going.

496
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:25,697
Rym: we get Maybe a mile out.

497
00:30:25,777 --> 00:30:25,917
Scott: Yes.

498
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:27,484
Scott: I'm basically super paying attention.

499
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:29,802
Scott: I'm like don't get hit by a tram Don't get hit by a car.

500
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:30,430
Scott: the whole time.

501
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,249
Scott: I'm thinking let's lay on the left side of the road and stay on the left side of the road.

502
00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:37,745
Scott: Use the correct brake lever stay on the left side of the road.

503
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:38,810
Scott: Don't get hit by a tram.

504
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:45,450
Rym: I kept almost like turning right and like oh nope left left stay on the left and I almost went into the right bike lane.

505
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,964
Rym: Like three times I was like no left bike lane.

506
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:50,249
Scott: So then something happened I did not expect at all.

507
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:55,026
Scott: Right, the trams are on tracks that are in the road as opposed to sticking out of the road.

508
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:57,013
Scott: for obvious reasons Right.

509
00:30:57,775 --> 00:31:01,307
Scott: I just put both wheels right into that track cuz the track would just go.

510
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:02,190
Rym: because basically we had that.

511
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,257
Rym: We were biking in a bike lane.

512
00:31:03,277 --> 00:31:05,070
Rym: There was a car like kind of derpy.

513
00:31:05,511 --> 00:31:14,162
Rym: so we had to go, you know go around the car and I think we were both just really focused on left left left and The tram track was had a switch there.

514
00:31:14,484 --> 00:31:15,630
Rym: So it's kind of like at an angle.

515
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:22,230
Rym: So unless you saw it and purposefully went over it at the at a good angle your tires would go right into it.

516
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,476
Scott: So and it's okay.

517
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:26,290
Scott: So both wheels are in this indent in the road.

518
00:31:26,491 --> 00:31:28,690
Scott: I should have just been able to go forward and stay in the grid.

519
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:36,986
Rym: I think what didn't help was that the bike our bike tires were like a Millimeter wider than the train tram track like if we've been in a road bike.

520
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:38,010
Rym: that would have sucked.

521
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:41,150
Rym: But you could have just stopped you would have kept rolling inside of the track.

522
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:46,050
Rym: But because we had these wide mountain tires that stuck your bike basically just did a full stop.

523
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:47,443
Scott: Yeah, so I basically I went.

524
00:31:47,463 --> 00:31:50,685
Scott: I you know I was basically I was veering to the left because I wanted.

525
00:31:50,705 --> 00:31:52,669
Scott: that's where you know I wanted to be on the road.

526
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:56,330
Scott: So I just basically fell over on the left like wham right on the ground

527
00:31:56,711 --> 00:32:02,814
Rym: I I hear a commotion and I kind of stopped and I see Scott on the ground and a heap and I'm like, ah great Great, so I pull over and

528
00:32:02,874 --> 00:32:05,261
Scott: I'm like really really I bike.

529
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:09,495
Scott: how many years when biking in New York, right New York City Manhattan.

530
00:32:09,756 --> 00:32:27,421
Scott: I've been biking here since oh nine it's current it's almost Oh 14 almost every day biking like five ten miles minimum usually more and zero literally zero accidents of any kind including falling over hitting anything or being hit by anything in Manhattan where people are fucking afraid to death to bike.

531
00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:34,563
Scott: and if I get in Melbourne on a weekday Basically sort of in between the city suburb area where there's really nothing going on.

532
00:32:34,904 --> 00:32:35,165
Scott: Yep.

533
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,770
Scott: Wham right in the ground immediately.

534
00:32:37,313 --> 00:32:40,930
Rym: So I pull over and I turn back around because you know bike accidents happen.

535
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,501
Rym: I'm thinking like alright, whatever come on Scott.

536
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:42,823
Rym: Let's go.

537
00:32:42,843 --> 00:32:43,649
Rym: I get up.

538
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:48,773
Rym: So I go over there and he's still laying on the ground by the time I bike back to him because I had to bike back Up the hill.

539
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:51,449
Rym: so I go back up there and Scott just lay in there.

540
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:53,924
Rym: So I kind of start waving cars out of the way.

541
00:32:53,944 --> 00:32:54,327
Rym: I'm like Scott.

542
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:54,850
Rym: Are you okay?

543
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:57,530
Rym: And I think you hit your head hard enough.

544
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,921
Rym: I don't think you had a concussion but you were doubly.

545
00:32:59,941 --> 00:33:01,730
Rym: you remember much of this initial bit.

546
00:33:01,871 --> 00:33:03,710
Scott: I remember putting the wheels in the thing.

547
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:05,989
Rym: What's the next thing you remember?

548
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,614
Scott: just Thinking about oh shit.

549
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:10,761
Scott: Don't let my head hit the ground.

550
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:26,027
Scott: Yeah, and then Basically sliding on the cement with my gloved hands Yeah, and then my helmet sort of hitting the ground slightly and then kicking the visor up Yeah, and then laying on the ground going Blair and then going really really.

551
00:33:26,268 --> 00:33:26,890
Rym: so I come over there.

552
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:32,342
Rym: I'm like Scott get up and he's like no He said no, I was way tired.

553
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:33,085
Scott: I was like Scott.

554
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:38,050
Rym: Come on like can get out of the road Are you okay, and he was like just let me lay here for a few minutes.

555
00:33:38,372 --> 00:33:41,669
Rym: Yeah, so he's laying there like in a heap like the bikes still kind of on top of him.

556
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:50,628
Rym: So I kind of pull his bike and I wave cars Yeah, and I'm like I kind of drag him sideways to the edge of the throw like I just got.

557
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:51,130
Rym: can you get up?

558
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,743
Rym: And he's like, yep, and he stands starts to stand up and then I was mad dizzy.

559
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,030
Rym: He's like, nope, and he slides back down.

560
00:33:58,931 --> 00:33:59,837
Rym: And I'm like, okay.

561
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:03,959
Rym: I think you're hurt and at this point he's bleeding Profusely from his chin.

562
00:34:03,979 --> 00:34:06,094
Rym: I didn't want to tell him yet I couldn't really.

563
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:09,347
Scott: I thought I was cuz I'd my chin definitely hit the ground.

564
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:12,726
Rym: Yep Did you notice you kept like trying to rub your chin on your shirt?

565
00:34:12,766 --> 00:34:16,743
Rym: I was like Scott Just don't rub you just wait because I know you you're.

566
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:21,109
Scott: I couldn't like feel or see if there was blood But I was like, yeah, I think I cut my chin but didn't really hurt.

567
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:27,373
Rym: Yeah, I figured because I know you and you can watch easy the killer and you're fine, but real blood Blood is fine.

568
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:29,784
Scott: It's not like I was looking at an open wound.

569
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:30,830
Rym: I was looking at an open wound.

570
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,157
Rym: It was it was toys that it was.

571
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:32,960
Rym: it wasn't really a cut.

572
00:34:32,981 --> 00:34:43,556
Rym: It was a gash great like four millimeters long but like two millimeters wide and the flesh was kind of like Dirt like hanging out.

573
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:44,080
Rym: I'm great.

574
00:34:44,442 --> 00:34:48,759
Rym: Yeah, so I Get you up and you get way dizzy and you're like.

575
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:53,695
Rym: and that's when you started saying really really really So I walk you over to this.

576
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:56,647
Scott: really I came all the way here and I was gonna bike around the whatever.

577
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:59,444
Rym: and yeah Yep, and I was like, are you okay?

578
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:00,210
Rym: Like you just dazed.

579
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,965
Rym: I figured he was just dazed at this point and he seemed fine.

580
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:04,372
Rym: other than that He was dazed.

581
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:08,650
Rym: so maybe you know minor head injury, whatever and the cut maybe some stitches no big deal.

582
00:35:09,011 --> 00:35:17,348
Rym: So I'd lean you against this fence and I turn around and then you drop your water bottle Just like it falls out of your hand and you start sliding down the fence and then you're sitting down.

583
00:35:18,372 --> 00:35:23,750
Rym: So I was like Scott think I need to call triple zero which we remembered to look up what that was.

584
00:35:24,192 --> 00:35:28,830
Scott: When we got there and I got the SIM cards, I was like, what's the emergency number for this fucking country?

585
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,221
Scott: He's like three zeros a pair.

586
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:35,396
Scott: open up to call an operator because it's Apparently most phones.

587
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:39,408
Rym: if you have a SIM card and you down 911, it'll route it to triple zero.

588
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:44,204
Rym: interesting Yeah, so I call the ambulance and they were one they.

589
00:35:44,345 --> 00:35:49,020
Rym: I had to pick what kind of emergency It was with this little menu and then I got to someone immediately.

590
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:50,424
Rym: They were super friendly.

591
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:52,290
Rym: They were super polite.

592
00:35:53,371 --> 00:36:07,323
Rym: They were the nicest I have ever Had a 911 or triple-zero operator ever be in my life because I've called 911 a bunch of times over the years in New York for various things and The person on the other end is usually super surly.

593
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:09,050
Scott: Yeah, they're like, all right, what's the emergency?

594
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,416
Scott: Okay, really?

595
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:12,805
Scott: Tell me your address.

596
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:13,409
Scott: Where are you?

597
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:17,130
Rym: Is anyone dead or are they just bleeding?

598
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,537
Scott: Is this really an emergency?

599
00:36:19,758 --> 00:36:22,770
Rym: how agitated is that homeless man who keeps attacking people.

600
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:26,769
Rym: Do you really need a cop to come or will he just tire himself out?

601
00:36:28,331 --> 00:36:29,750
Rym: But no, they were like super polite.

602
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:36,369
Rym: so they're like all right, look we're gonna send someone and they asked me all these good questions and Scott's just kind of sitting there kind of dazed.

603
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:40,030
Rym: and Then an ambulance comes and I go wave it.

604
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:46,075
Scott: Well, we hear some sirens and I'm like really you don't need sirens for a guy who fell off a bike and it's Conscious and sitting here.

605
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:47,479
Scott: It's not necessary.

606
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:47,640
Rym: Yep.

607
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,930
Rym: So I waved the guy down and he pulls over slows down.

608
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,170
Rym: He's like sorry mate had a cardiac arrest.

609
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:56,698
Rym: Someone else will be along for you shortly.

610
00:36:56,718 --> 00:37:01,910
Rym: and then he drives off again and it's like wow Well that made sense that was polite.

611
00:37:02,072 --> 00:37:03,970
Scott: You never see her in the ambulance in the u.s.

612
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,698
Scott: It's not gonna pull over and talk to someone who's waving at them.

613
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:10,450
Rym: They had three EMTs and they immediately are hilarious.

614
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:15,092
Scott: They look at Scott and they're like, oh, that's the second ambulance that actually showed up without Sirens.

615
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:15,334
Scott: Yes,

616
00:37:15,354 --> 00:37:23,572
Rym: the main the main woman who was kind of the leader of the group I guess comes over to me and she asked me all these questions while the other two were poking and prodding and Scott and checking his neck to Make sure nothing was

617
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:25,560
Scott: crazy my neck so many times.

618
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:27,870
Scott: It's like seriously you already checked that neck.

619
00:37:28,031 --> 00:37:28,658
Rym: Well, they have to be.

620
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:29,610
Rym: they asked me a bunch of times.

621
00:37:29,892 --> 00:37:31,140
Rym: Remember when I dragged you out of the street?

622
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,670
Rym: remember when I kicked your leg a bunch of times.

623
00:37:33,012 --> 00:37:41,630
Rym: I was making sure that you didn't have any like obvious neck or Back injuries and you just had your normal injuries pretty unlikely.

624
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:51,250
Rym: Yeah, I want to make sure cuz I before I didn't want to Severely jostle your Jimmy's until I was sure that there was no danger of further Jimmy jostling.

625
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:58,050
Rym: So once they determined that he was not dying they were like, so yeah, we'll take him to the hospital.

626
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,059
Rym: We can take his bike too.

627
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,895
Rym: If you want to keep going on your trip They were totally like yeah, you should just keep biking We'll deal with this.

628
00:38:06,457 --> 00:38:09,410
Rym: and they took my phone and they're like we got to take some pictures of him.

629
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,499
Rym: So you can make fun of him later.

630
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:14,790
Rym: and I was like no And she takes the phone and takes all these pictures of him in the ambulance.

631
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:37,067
Rym: She actually took his bike and just put it in the ambulance and they were like, yeah well, uh, you can come collect him later and then they drove off and I just kept biking and I spent the rest of the day biking all the way up and down the coast along the beaches and saw a crazy jellyfish and I saw a Luna Park, which is basically the Coney Island of Australia.

632
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:37,590
Scott: I'm great.

633
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:39,960
Scott: Yeah, I didn't see any of that shit.

634
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,261
Rym: Yep.

635
00:38:40,281 --> 00:38:40,944
Rym: So what did you see?

636
00:38:41,025 --> 00:38:42,230
Scott: I saw an Australian Hospital.

637
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:43,276
Rym: How was that?

638
00:38:43,296 --> 00:38:45,226
Rym: I think they took it was the the Alfred.

639
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:53,110
Scott: Yep So I'm sure you know, I don't want to say it's the best hospital ever But basically I will say it's more likely US hospitals are shit.

640
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:59,390
Scott: I mean we knew that already right but to the degree to which they are shit is now very clear.

641
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,494
Rym: Yeah, let's go back in time.

642
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:03,345
Rym: Rym cuts the front of his fucking pinky off.

643
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:06,675
Rym: Like I cut it off It's dangling by a thread.

644
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,480
Rym: No, I can see nerves.

645
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,465
Rym: It is pulsing blood.

646
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:12,050
Rym: I hit my bone with the knife.

647
00:39:13,114 --> 00:39:22,523
Rym: I go to a hospital and after four hours of no one helping me I walked out without treatments and got stitches from a clinic.

648
00:39:22,744 --> 00:39:24,930
Rym: then actually I didn't get stitches because it was too late.

649
00:39:25,352 --> 00:39:35,630
Rym: I got superglue and iodine from a clinic the next day Mm-hmm, and in fact had I gotten stitches they probably I probably wouldn't have lost all the sensation in the tip of my finger.

650
00:39:36,091 --> 00:39:41,106
Rym: But now American Hospital didn't want one fucking second to work with me, right?

651
00:39:41,126 --> 00:39:45,981
Scott: So they take me in the hospital and Immediately, they're making me fill out the forms.

652
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:50,423
Scott: and you know as soon as I hand in forms They come and talk to me right away and it's like there was busy.

653
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:51,428
Scott: No waiting.

654
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:56,886
Scott: I waited Effectively almost zero not exactly zero but almost zero.

655
00:39:57,106 --> 00:39:59,574
Scott: right like as soon as I was done They're like, all right Scott come this way.

656
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:10,694
Scott: I'm like, all right, and then like in a minute someone's checking me out and then You know, he's talking to me ask me questions check on my neck and again Stitching me up right?

657
00:40:10,755 --> 00:40:12,681
Scott: It's like there's no waiting here.

658
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:16,655
Scott: I just immediately emergency room and then it's like, okay We're gonna x-ray your arm.

659
00:40:16,695 --> 00:40:17,298
Scott: you fucked up.

660
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,870
Scott: follow the black lines of the x-ray room.

661
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,060
Scott: So I follow the black line on the floor and there's an x-ray room.

662
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:37,490
Scott: I just walk in they x-ray me immediately I walk back then I waited maybe 10 15 minutes and then they looked at the x-rays and then you know, it's like it took basically no waiting.

663
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:48,710
Scott: I was maybe at the hospital for a total of three to four hours and then as soon as I was done and walking out It was coincidentally good timing Rym was there getting the bike at the same time.

664
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:55,043
Rym: Yeah, basically I biked around all day and because Google latitude still worked I actually have a nice map of everywhere I buy.

665
00:40:55,285 --> 00:41:07,770
Scott: but I hope you know I'm pretty sure in all the other good modern socialized medicine countries like, you know, maybe Canada UK Japan probably that hospitals are probably equally as good as that an emergency room situation.

666
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,306
Scott: I was actually on the fast track, which I think means yeah, we know what's wrong with you.

667
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:13,310
Scott: It's probably really simple.

668
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:17,030
Scott: We're just gonna treat you and send you on your way, but BAM and that's the fast track, right?

669
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,270
Scott: Which is me which and it was indeed a fast track.

670
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:22,819
Scott: There's no such thing as a fucking fast track in the US.

671
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:25,790
Rym: Yeah, there's the slow track and the slower track.

672
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:38,777
Scott: I think part of the reason for the The good emergency room speeds was that you know, since they have socialized medicine poor people went to the regular doctor For their regular stuff.

673
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:41,628
Scott: Oh, we were only there for actual emergencies.

674
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:47,870
Rym: Wait a minute Are you implying that if we had universal health care that we would solve a lot of our basic infrastructural problems with health care.

675
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:53,808
Scott: All I'm saying is Australian Hospital good US Hospital not good.

676
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:55,316
Scott: Yep It's all I'm saying.

677
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,670
Rym: and you know, you might say oh, well our hospitals are good.

678
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,430
Scott: If you're rich, you know, it was really not so much going to hospital never a good thing.

679
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,906
Scott: Seriously get a good tourist experience out of it that time and I cut my finger off.

680
00:42:06,408 --> 00:42:12,765
Rym: I had Ridiculous rich person insurance and tons of money and still could not get good treatment.

681
00:42:12,785 --> 00:42:14,410
Scott: You went to poor people Newburgh Hospital.

682
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,912
Rym: I went to.

683
00:42:15,254 --> 00:42:18,310
Rym: yeah, I would have had to want like hire a helicopter to go to the rich hospital.

684
00:42:19,472 --> 00:42:22,310
Scott: Hey, I wonder where the rich people like Garrison go if they have a problem.

685
00:42:22,913 --> 00:42:26,389
Rym: I know of a few fancy hospitals in New York like New York City that you can go to.

686
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:28,937
Rym: Yeah, but they're not quick emergency dream.

687
00:42:28,957 --> 00:42:34,573
Scott: Well, you know Mike my my mom's cousin the crazy Orthodox Anesthesiologist, right?

688
00:42:34,613 --> 00:42:36,801
Scott: I think he was working at was a Columbia maybe.

689
00:42:37,303 --> 00:42:39,170
Rym: so I'm a reform anesthesiologist.

690
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:45,862
Scott: His dad had my great-uncle had cancer Basically, he got him into like the rich people floor and I got to go.

691
00:42:45,882 --> 00:42:57,650
Scott: I was visiting and there's basically a rich people floor in the hospital, which is basically like a Tiny Mandarin hotel that takes up a whole floor and each room is sort of a hospital room, right?

692
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:04,450
Scott: But outside the hospital room, it's basically luxury hotel and the food is way better and everything is way better.

693
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:08,530
Scott: So if you're rich, you can go to that kind of place if you have problem.

694
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:11,454
Scott: So, yeah All right.

695
00:43:11,695 --> 00:43:20,995
Rym: So other Australia things that aren't hospitals Well, I'll say this so I biked over because down down in Melbourne in the place that Scott wanted to go There was the old racetrack.

696
00:43:21,597 --> 00:43:23,402
Rym: There's not an old racetrack.

697
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:24,084
Rym: It's old.

698
00:43:24,124 --> 00:43:25,488
Rym: It's because it's not used anymore.

699
00:43:25,508 --> 00:43:25,950
Rym: It's gone.

700
00:43:26,712 --> 00:43:27,294
Scott: What do you mean?

701
00:43:27,915 --> 00:43:33,029
Rym: So the the racetrack that was left was basically just a road that doesn't go and use it every year.

702
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:36,047
Rym: Yeah, and right now it's old because there's nothing going on there.

703
00:43:36,068 --> 00:43:38,737
Rym: There's no Road it's a road course.

704
00:43:38,757 --> 00:43:39,881
Scott: Yes race on regular roads.

705
00:43:39,901 --> 00:43:42,650
Rym: So basically it well, it's a regular road closed circuit.

706
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:46,409
Rym: It's a regular road that no one would ever use because it doesn't go anywhere.

707
00:43:47,913 --> 00:43:48,862
Scott: Doesn't it go around the lake?

708
00:43:49,487 --> 00:43:52,097
Rym: Uh Yeah, no one would go around that lake.

709
00:43:52,157 --> 00:43:52,418
Rym: Really?

710
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:54,384
Rym: There's no reason to okay.

711
00:43:54,785 --> 00:43:56,350
Rym: It's literally there's nothing there.

712
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,334
Rym: There's a bunch of bike paths.

713
00:43:57,595 --> 00:44:04,770
Rym: they go around the lake and there's a road around the lake that no one appears to drive on ever Mm-hmm, and then I kept going along the beach.

714
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:12,961
Rym: And the one thing I realized as after I realized how far I'd gotten biking We could have just fucking biked all the way to Phillip Island.

715
00:44:13,262 --> 00:44:14,004
Scott: It would have taken a while.

716
00:44:14,025 --> 00:44:16,994
Rym: But yeah, I Would have taken that long.

717
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:17,776
Rym: Maybe a day.

718
00:44:17,796 --> 00:44:21,447
Scott: Yeah half a day and three quarters of a day six to eight hours, maybe.

719
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:25,590
Rym: Yep It would have been a pretty good ride too, but I got a decent ways down.

720
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,382
Scott: We didn't need better bikes and we would have needed a way to keep the bikes.

721
00:44:28,462 --> 00:44:31,890
Rym: the cool thing about the beaches in Melvin Is that it was winter, right?

722
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:40,530
Rym: The water was warmer in the ocean there in the winter because I was crazy close to Antarctica to Antarctica that I've been in my whole life.

723
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:46,310
Rym: That water was warmer to the point that I would almost consider touching it and maybe like surfing in it.

724
00:44:47,091 --> 00:44:51,730
Rym: Then the water and Wildwood in late May or the water in Lake Superior.

725
00:44:51,871 --> 00:44:54,460
Scott: Well ever water in any Great Lake ever.

726
00:44:55,203 --> 00:44:56,468
Rym: Lake Erie is actually really warm.

727
00:44:56,729 --> 00:44:56,910
Scott: when?

728
00:44:57,931 --> 00:44:58,635
Rym: Most of the summer.

729
00:44:58,796 --> 00:44:59,097
Scott: Okay.

730
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,210
Rym: It actually is sure.

731
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:04,538
Scott: It's also the lake you least want to go in.

732
00:45:04,718 --> 00:45:06,866
Rym: why dirtiest it's?

733
00:45:06,926 --> 00:45:13,486
Scott: it's been cleaned up substantially I'm just saying like Ontario telling me name a great lake that is dirtier than Lake Erie.

734
00:45:13,807 --> 00:45:14,188
Rym: Okay.

735
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:25,105
Rym: Okay So I took the bike back to the place cuz the guy who ran the bike rental place Obviously didn't want to stay there that long.

736
00:45:25,185 --> 00:45:25,950
Scott: He had no business.

737
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:30,290
Rym: He seemed kind of annoyed that we rented bikes cuz it meant you had to stay there all the way until his closing time.

738
00:45:30,993 --> 00:45:41,505
Rym: So I come back, you know a little while later with one bike and I'm like, I'm gonna drop this bike off and I'll come back later with the other bike.

739
00:45:41,545 --> 00:45:45,590
Rym: and he expressed zero interest in what happened to Scott.

740
00:45:47,091 --> 00:45:48,316
Rym: so later I can.

741
00:45:48,336 --> 00:45:56,203
Rym: I took the tram to the hospital and then I took Scott's bike back and I get there and I give him the stuff for that bike and I'm all done.

742
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:57,910
Rym: and he was like, all right great.

743
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,338
Rym: And then he immediately just locked up the shop and left.

744
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,589
Rym: Mmm never at any point expressed any interest in what happened to you.

745
00:46:04,072 --> 00:46:06,790
Rym: Why it was just me why I brought back both bikes.

746
00:46:08,211 --> 00:46:10,361
Scott: So yeah, a non-curious person.

747
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:15,730
Rym: Yep, but it was Melvin's really bikable because I biked around the downtown area.

748
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:24,450
Scott: Yeah Yeah The tram tracks are more dangerous than the tram.

749
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,576
Scott: It's like if the tram hits you.

750
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,750
Scott: yeah, you're dead, but that's very hard to get hit by it.

751
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:28,813
Rym: Oh, yeah, so it turned out.

752
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:29,636
Rym: your arm was broken.

753
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:30,819
Scott: It's fractured.

754
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:31,943
Rym: Yeah, what's up Scott?

755
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:32,746
Rym: fracture broken?

756
00:46:32,766 --> 00:46:34,030
Rym: Yeah broke bone.

757
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:40,883
Scott: Well broken is usually only used when it's broken all the way through And fracture is the word you use for a partial braking.

758
00:46:41,044 --> 00:46:42,209
Rym: Yep, so it wasn't broken off.

759
00:46:42,854 --> 00:46:44,610
Scott: No, that would have been very wasn't sticking out.

760
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,313
Scott: That would have been.

761
00:46:45,474 --> 00:46:46,439
Scott: I would have been not.

762
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,529
Rym: you would have been sad if you looked out and there was bony I'm sticking I would have been barfed and passed out.

763
00:46:55,865 --> 00:47:01,934
Rym: Yeah, so I have a bunch of pictures of biking up and down the coast The Scott hasn't seen.

764
00:47:01,954 --> 00:47:03,499
Rym: I guess they'll look kind of the same.

765
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:11,530
Rym: the beaches are so ridiculously clean No, and so nice and the dunes are so tall.

766
00:47:11,651 --> 00:47:13,601
Rym: I want to be in that area in the wild.

767
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:18,818
Scott: the beach is pretty clean after the common But it's not clean in the same way.

768
00:47:18,938 --> 00:47:21,366
Scott: non non Australia related thing, right?

769
00:47:21,386 --> 00:47:22,710
Scott: So here my work is NBC.

770
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:23,594
Scott: It's around the corner.

771
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:33,250
Scott: Yep, right and a lot of time is basically musicians come there I think for the today show or for other shit and One of those boy bands, I guess the One Direction was gonna be there for something.

772
00:47:33,753 --> 00:47:53,459
Scott: So all these girls have been waiting there since like last night when I biked home from work I saw them waiting now had like these 1d signs and stuff and today when I biked past basically I think they were clearing them out like I guess their shit happened and There was still those fenced in areas where they sit and wait, you know for I guess 24 plus hours to see their whatever boy like.

773
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:54,623
Rym: we should have done that time.

774
00:47:54,643 --> 00:47:55,726
Rym: We went to the Nintendo store.

775
00:47:55,747 --> 00:48:07,770
Scott: Yeah, basically They littered the fuck out of those little pendant areas And if I was that One Direction I would have been like we're not doing the show for you people who littered all over the Street fuck you, but they're just a boy band.

776
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:10,350
Scott: They got to do whatever the contract says and they probably even know or care.

777
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:15,379
Scott: But that's what I would have done if I saw that my fans had lured the fuck out of whatever the way I'll show you the picture.

778
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,027
Scott: I took my guys.

779
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:22,170
Rym: So if they let the line into our panel at PAX, we're gonna go outside and look if there's litter all along that line.

780
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,540
Rym: We're not running the fucking panel.

781
00:48:23,741 --> 00:48:24,809
Scott: It's never happened ever.

782
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:32,570
Scott: Yeah, cuz but I know if there was like a panel and the people were just like clearly like, you know Not good people in the audience and they didn't you know, I'd be like, oh fuck you not doing it.

783
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:34,589
Rym: Yeah, like one of it like one of them has a MOBA shirt.

784
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:36,806
Scott: I've never had to do this.

785
00:48:36,926 --> 00:48:39,709
Scott: obviously It could theoretically happen, right?

786
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:43,643
Scott: But yeah, I'll show you they made a disaster of that that little area.

787
00:48:43,944 --> 00:49:00,590
Rym: So the hotel That has the big casino in Melbourne has a thing the crown and the thing is that they have these big columns That have water popping out of them like fountains and every night on the hours they shoot fire out of the top.

788
00:49:00,953 --> 00:49:02,870
Rym: Mm-hmm, that sounds like a really lame thing.

789
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:07,130
Scott: But but they have a whole bunch of towers and they sort of shoot the fire in a sequence and it's a big fire.

790
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:07,921
Scott: So it's like doom doom.

791
00:49:07,962 --> 00:49:08,428
Rym: That's the thing.

792
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:13,967
Rym: It sounds really lame when people describe it, but people kept describing it and kept mentioning it.

793
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:14,830
Scott: It's not bad.

794
00:49:15,171 --> 00:49:17,159
Scott: So like alright, it's kind of what they do in Vegas.

795
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:20,010
Rym: who tried to go over there, but it was also fucking cold.

796
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:26,897
Scott: We were really hungry so we went into the dessert place inside the casino right near the edge Which is actually probably the best dessert place.

797
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:28,443
Rym: Oh my god those pies.

798
00:49:28,503 --> 00:49:30,110
Scott: They had these pies and cakes in there.

799
00:49:30,694 --> 00:49:32,790
Rym: Like I was like, alright, I'm gonna get your cake pie.

800
00:49:33,091 --> 00:49:36,481
Rym: They had this like you get a slice of pie and some ice cream and whatever.

801
00:49:36,561 --> 00:49:39,610
Rym: but the pie selection was off the hook.

802
00:49:40,052 --> 00:49:44,597
Scott: It was basically we're like looking for a place where you just get like a slice of cake and it's like there's the only place You could find.

803
00:49:44,658 --> 00:49:45,529
Scott: but it was crazy good.

804
00:49:45,932 --> 00:49:49,669
Rym: So we go in there, but then because we got the fancy pie it took too long.

805
00:49:50,152 --> 00:49:53,245
Rym: So we hear the fire thing is starting up outside and we're inside.

806
00:49:53,286 --> 00:49:54,109
Scott: we can barely see it.

807
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,918
Scott: We can see like the reflection of it off the.

808
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:56,863
Scott: we see some reflection.

809
00:49:56,903 --> 00:49:57,486
Rym: So like whatever.

810
00:49:57,566 --> 00:49:58,390
Rym: Alright, so we're just eating.

811
00:49:58,552 --> 00:49:59,483
Scott: I clearly seemed cool.

812
00:49:59,503 --> 00:50:00,009
Scott: We should check that.

813
00:50:00,092 --> 00:50:00,182
Rym: Yeah.

814
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:08,194
Rym: But then the fire got bigger and bigger to the point where like outside was lit up like there was a tiny Sun And this was night.

815
00:50:08,435 --> 00:50:12,210
Rym: Yeah, and like you can only you can feel the heat like and we were inside.

816
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:13,315
Scott: We could feel the heat through the wind.

817
00:50:13,335 --> 00:50:16,910
Rym: We're like, oh, I guess that thing is actually kind of cool.

818
00:50:17,452 --> 00:50:20,003
Scott: Yeah, probably worth seeing because it's only like 10 minutes long.

819
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,770
Rym: so the next night we go back over there.

820
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,496
Scott: I think it's two nights later, but it doesn't matter.

821
00:50:23,516 --> 00:50:27,070
Rym: We went back another night and we got cake and pie early.

822
00:50:27,832 --> 00:50:28,475
Rym: Then we stand there.

823
00:50:28,515 --> 00:50:31,365
Scott: actually I got a croissant filled with chocolate.

824
00:50:31,646 --> 00:50:32,248
Rym: Oh you did what.

825
00:50:32,268 --> 00:50:32,950
Rym: did I get something?

826
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,956
Rym: That was too much food.

827
00:50:33,976 --> 00:50:36,330
Rym: It was like this white shine was just the right amount.

828
00:50:36,611 --> 00:50:42,138
Rym: I got this like white chocolate truffle thing that I couldn't finish because it was just the richest thing I've ever tried to eat my entire life.

829
00:50:42,158 --> 00:50:44,410
Rym: Okay, so we're standing there.

830
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:48,504
Rym: It was really windy and it starts up and it's like a little putt putt of fire.

831
00:50:48,525 --> 00:50:51,979
Rym: a little putt putt of fire And then it just fucking turns off.

832
00:50:52,059 --> 00:50:52,782
Scott: Yeah, clearly.

833
00:50:52,843 --> 00:50:54,430
Scott: It's somewhat manually controlled.

834
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:56,838
Scott: Yeah, some guys because it was too windy.

835
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:58,805
Rym: some guys obviously had a keyboard of.

836
00:50:58,946 --> 00:51:00,030
Rym: make the fire come out.

837
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:07,985
Rym: Yeah, and he probably sits there watching it on like a closed-circuit TV and decides like I'll make this one go I'll make this one go I'll do a cool thing.

838
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:11,943
Rym: and Obviously they have one of them that they can attest with to see if it'll work.

839
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:13,690
Rym: and the mechanism looks pretty simple.

840
00:51:13,831 --> 00:51:18,110
Rym: They just have a pilot light and they just dump gas out onto it.

841
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:20,825
Scott: The thing just sprays a fuck ton of gas right into the pilot light.

842
00:51:20,946 --> 00:51:28,789
Rym: Yep Apparently when they first built it it roasted a whole bunch of pigeons And now it looks like they have it set up to warn the pigeons before it starts.

843
00:51:29,771 --> 00:51:34,447
Rym: Or the pigeons that were not leery that thing are all dead and the rest of the pigeons notice it.

844
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:35,310
Rym: a fuck away from it.

845
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:44,170
Rym: The pigeons have learned, yeah but that whole downtown area at night was kind of It was I don't want to say fake because it wasn't fake.

846
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:55,913
Rym: It was like people were there doing their normal business But it was the kind of place that could not exist in a city like New York without being filled with homeless people and trash Because it was just.

847
00:51:56,214 --> 00:52:00,950
Rym: there were benches and little secluded areas that were kind of quiet and out of the way

848
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:01,675
Scott: Like water

849
00:52:01,998 --> 00:52:12,737
Rym: like you could sit on the water Basically out of sight of anyone in the middle of the night Eating your cake or pie or whatever and There wasn't a homeless person living there.

850
00:52:13,499 --> 00:52:15,065
Scott: There were some homeless people's we saw.

851
00:52:15,105 --> 00:52:18,597
Scott: they're mostly seem to be crazies But but the city because of socialism's.

852
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:24,229
Scott: really those people are just crazies or people who have you know Refused to accept the welfare or whatever.

853
00:52:25,134 --> 00:52:33,850
Rym: There were areas along the waterfront where you could sit Quietly where no one else could see you and the city did not have a problem with this.

854
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:36,849
Rym: They didn't have like spikes to make sure people don't lay down.

855
00:52:37,331 --> 00:52:48,546
Rym: They didn't have like those areas that are designed almost like panopticons where you can't actually be anywhere private because if people are somewhere private they'll be up to shady shit or at least the city's afraid of that.

856
00:52:48,948 --> 00:52:53,176
Rym: there weren't a lot of cops around and No one really seemed to bother anybody.

857
00:52:53,216 --> 00:52:53,598
Rym: It was just.

858
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,701
Rym: it was weird.

859
00:52:54,721 --> 00:52:55,704
Rym: It was pleasant kind of like.

860
00:52:55,765 --> 00:52:57,109
Rym: Providence has areas like that.

861
00:52:57,932 --> 00:52:58,674
Scott: Yeah, not New York.

862
00:52:58,835 --> 00:52:59,417
Rym: Not New York.

863
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:01,144
Rym: New York can't have places like that.

864
00:53:01,164 --> 00:53:02,830
Scott: Well, maybe in some outer boroughs.

865
00:53:03,732 --> 00:53:06,849
Rym: So we went to a bunch of museums and we went to the zoo the Melbourne Zoo.

866
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:09,396
Scott: Yeah So the museums we went to were.

867
00:53:09,416 --> 00:53:18,844
Scott: we went to a lot of free places for example the Parliament House the Parliament of Victoria Which is the state government house, but it used to be, you know worked originally.

868
00:53:18,884 --> 00:53:20,690
Scott: they were before the United into Australia.

869
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,099
Scott: They were just colonies like the same way Connecticut.

870
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,484
Scott: It was a colony of Britain.

871
00:53:24,725 --> 00:53:24,905
Rym: Yep.

872
00:53:25,146 --> 00:53:26,230
Scott: Victoria was a colonies.

873
00:53:26,351 --> 00:53:40,250
Scott: It was actually the colonial Parliament originally And you know is the Australian state parliament now And it was crazy royal and shit, which you know, I sort of had been used to by that point after seeing the government house.

874
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:44,947
Scott: Yep, but yeah way royal like at to the point where they have like gold maces.

875
00:53:44,967 --> 00:53:45,850
Scott: They had to carry around.

876
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,469
Scott: Yeah, we're sitting there conduct business.

877
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:51,084
Scott: We're saying like air for the fucking queen slash king to sit in.

878
00:53:51,124 --> 00:53:55,370
Rym: we're in the the House of Lord Whatever thing the Opera House of Lords equivalent.

879
00:53:55,591 --> 00:53:57,017
Rym: Yes, because they went into.

880
00:53:57,118 --> 00:54:04,610
Rym: they went into a lot of explanation of parliamentary procedure and I guess cuz I only know sort of like ghetto parliamentary procedure.

881
00:54:04,691 --> 00:54:11,579
Rym: I never think about it in terms of what the British government Not just a parliamentary because yes parliamentary procedure.

882
00:54:12,062 --> 00:54:16,780
Rym: and at one point she's like Yeah So like she's talking about how they renovated everything and the gold.

883
00:54:17,242 --> 00:54:21,725
Rym: and then I'm thinking I look and there's all this gold Everywhere and yeah, it's all real gold.

884
00:54:21,765 --> 00:54:26,170
Scott: They just put gold By the way, all of this stuff that looks like gold paint is actually real gold everywhere.

885
00:54:26,311 --> 00:54:27,435
Rym: Yes, all of it.

886
00:54:27,695 --> 00:54:30,526
Scott: Also all that gold that looks shinier than the other gold.

887
00:54:30,927 --> 00:54:34,959
Scott: That's new gold We repainted when we renovated but the old gold is under that gold.

888
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:42,356
Rym: Yep, and we're in there with basically a bunch of tourists and They're tourists in these stereotypical sense.

889
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:45,505
Rym: So every two minutes in the middle of her talk.

890
00:54:45,545 --> 00:54:49,337
Rym: She'd be like, please come back Don't wander off come back here.

891
00:54:49,618 --> 00:54:50,381
Rym: you come back.

892
00:54:50,602 --> 00:54:51,666
Rym: you stop touching that.

893
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:57,906
Rym: you come here Like don't take the gold like seriously you fucking tourists seriously.

894
00:54:57,926 --> 00:55:02,162
Rym: I hate you all everywhere in the world that you go like literally.

895
00:55:02,202 --> 00:55:06,818
Rym: she'd like get everyone together and like cajole them into all sitting down and then start talking.

896
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:15,368
Rym: she'd turn her back and half these people would just get up and wander off Into the places that they're not supposed to go because there's business going on back royal business.

897
00:55:15,408 --> 00:55:17,875
Rym: Yeah But it was pretty cool.

898
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:19,080
Scott: I think I was.

899
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,590
Scott: I really wanted him to sit in the Queen's chair.

900
00:55:22,011 --> 00:55:23,236
Rym: I might have gotten in some trouble.

901
00:55:23,296 --> 00:55:24,018
Rym: I would yeah boot.

902
00:55:24,379 --> 00:55:24,701
Scott: What are they?

903
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:24,881
Scott: Yes.

904
00:55:24,961 --> 00:55:26,226
Rym: Why didn't you sit in the Queen's chair?

905
00:55:26,246 --> 00:55:27,310
Scott: I was.

906
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:31,556
Scott: I'd already been to the hospital.

907
00:55:31,617 --> 00:55:34,290
Scott: You was your turn to check out the jails, but we went to all these.

908
00:55:35,892 --> 00:55:42,750
Scott: We went to all these sort of like the weird Museum the old Treasury building which is now a museum and we saw where they used to keep the gold.

909
00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:47,550
Scott: Keep the gold somewhere else now, they like gold there, but that had all this stuff about Ned Kelly.

910
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:53,310
Scott: Oh my god, Kelly, Ned Kelly Kelly's basically the I guess famous criminal of Australia.

911
00:55:53,471 --> 00:56:01,542
Scott: And this dude is a badass war fucking armor and shot people Badass also, he might have been the first weeaboo.

912
00:56:01,602 --> 00:56:20,141
Rym: He cosplayed his armor was based on quote oriental armor that he learned about like samurai armor and He was a fanboy of Asian culture in a general sense and apparently models little gang after it and His last words were something to the effect of one of those.

913
00:56:20,241 --> 00:56:22,750
Rym: oriental is worth more than a hundred of you assholes.

914
00:56:23,536 --> 00:56:30,202
Scott: He was just really into Asian culture, I think it wasn't his gang full of like Chinese people.

915
00:56:30,423 --> 00:56:30,623
Rym: Yep.

916
00:56:30,684 --> 00:56:38,790
Rym: I think some Japanese people - maybe I Worry because the a lot of the literature we were reading in the museum was like contemporary news articles.

917
00:56:39,453 --> 00:56:41,803
Rym: So they used the term oriental a lot.

918
00:56:42,084 --> 00:56:46,919
Rym: So it's hard to tell Which type of Asian cultures they were talking.

919
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:50,207
Scott: Australia so racist which brings us to the Immigration Museum.

920
00:56:50,227 --> 00:56:51,490
Rym: the Immigration Museum was great.

921
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:53,299
Rym: It was basically let's try.

922
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,730
Scott: Yeah, it was a museum for Australians.

923
00:56:55,810 --> 00:57:02,116
Scott: So it was weird being there is not Australians, but it's basically saying Australians you so racist Stop being racist.

924
00:57:02,136 --> 00:57:03,481
Rym: We're trying hard to not be race.

925
00:57:03,501 --> 00:57:05,730
Scott: We're less racist than we used to be but you're still fucking racist.

926
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,539
Scott: Jesus Christ, look at how racist we used to be.

927
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:08,223
Scott: Holy fuck.

928
00:57:08,343 --> 00:57:11,235
Rym: Yep, the white Australia policy Luther King jr.

929
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:13,444
Scott: Here seriously into the modern era.

930
00:57:13,524 --> 00:57:14,850
Scott: so we have this museum instead.

931
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:30,231
Rym: I think my favorite of the ridiculous racism was why forget the guy's name, but there was one Article in that whole museum and one of these newspapers about an initiative to take all the aborigines and send them to Africa Africa.

932
00:57:30,392 --> 00:57:34,428
Rym: yeah, it really takes a moment to sink in just how fucking stupid that idea is.

933
00:57:35,172 --> 00:57:36,961
Scott: I loved it was a thing there where you.

934
00:57:37,142 --> 00:57:41,910
Scott: it was sort of like papers, please But it was sort of like a you know, just a video, you know kiosk thing.

935
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:45,230
Scott: I'm like, would you let this person in and it's like, you know ask this person questions.

936
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:48,864
Scott: It's like little videos of people talking to you and it's like would you let them into the country?

937
00:57:48,964 --> 00:57:58,170
Scott: and it's basically like yeah I would let all these people in because I'm not a racist asshole But basically I'm supposed to be role-playing some jerk from the olden times and it's like of course, I'm a racist jerk.

938
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:59,314
Scott: I'm not letting this person in.

939
00:57:59,334 --> 00:58:03,047
Scott: Yeah, cuz they're not white and from the UK, you know, they're otherwise perfectly.

940
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:03,930
Rym: Okay, it's good.

941
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:15,430
Rym: it reminds me of a lot of the stuff I'd see in museums as a kid like in the mid 90s where the Like even the big Melbourne Museum the main one we went to which is the biggest museum in the southern hemisphere.

942
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:18,540
Scott: Yeah, so I don't need to go to the southern hemisphere museum.

943
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:26,906
Rym: They're definitely really pushing the angle of Exposing the bad stuff from the past to remind people that we got to stop doing.

944
00:58:26,926 --> 00:58:31,081
Rym: the museums are mostly about Yeah, but my favorite exhibit actually not.

945
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:33,470
Rym: our lab had nothing to do with Australia.

946
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:34,694
Rym: I think we talked about far lab.

947
00:58:34,754 --> 00:58:35,557
Scott: Did we did we?

948
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:38,788
Rym: maybe far lab was the biggest and best.

949
00:58:38,868 --> 00:58:41,819
Scott: god damn He repeated something from our previous Australia episode.

950
00:58:41,899 --> 00:58:42,642
Scott: We can't remember.

951
00:58:42,662 --> 00:58:44,830
Scott: Yeah shows you how much we listen to GeekNights.

952
00:58:45,872 --> 00:58:47,020
Rym: Far lab we go in.

953
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,550
Rym: we see this stuffed horse.

954
00:58:48,931 --> 00:58:53,730
Rym: It looks fake because it's too big to be a normal horse and it's so like perfect and magnificent.

955
00:58:53,911 --> 00:58:55,135
Rym: It was too big.

956
00:58:55,195 --> 00:58:59,750
Rym: like I know horses I better on horses and I'm like, that's a that's a big model of a horse.

957
00:58:59,991 --> 00:59:00,472
Rym: I get up there.

958
00:59:00,613 --> 00:59:01,636
Rym: Nope taxidermy.

959
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:02,780
Rym: Nope real horse.

960
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:03,302
Rym: Nope.

961
00:59:03,643 --> 00:59:05,750
Rym: Maybe the fastest racing horse ever.

962
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:07,920
Scott: Yeah, fuck you secretariat.

963
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:16,853
Scott: Oh murdered by the mob Like for real reels the mob poison the horse because it was winning before it got a chance to go to the US and try To Kentucky Derby.

964
00:59:16,913 --> 00:59:18,519
Rym: it Oh far lap.

965
00:59:18,881 --> 00:59:21,130
Scott: Yeah, good name to pH AR lap.

966
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:27,409
Rym: But my favorite exhibit was the treasures from the Taliban.

967
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:28,594
Scott: Oh, yes Okay, so is it?

968
00:59:28,714 --> 00:59:31,930
Scott: that was the like the temporary exhibit that they really it's a traveling thing.

969
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:35,410
Scott: No, we weren't allowed to take pictures of it, right?

970
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,354
Scott: but we went in to see.

971
00:59:36,374 --> 00:59:36,796
Scott: that's like that.

972
00:59:36,816 --> 00:59:43,030
Scott: you had to pay extra money to see it because the temporary hot exhibit sort of Like when they have the Tim Burton exhibit at the MoMA is like the temporary thing.

973
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,800
Rym: That's more money like we went to that Silk Road thing that one time.

974
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:53,182
Scott: So the deal was basically some awesome dudes Rescued all these artifacts from Afghanistan when the Taliban was taking power.

975
00:59:53,202 --> 01:00:05,298
Rym: a bunch of a bunch of the museum staff Bravely took a bunch of these exhibits that would have been destroyed because the Taliban was destroying any Non-islamic artifacts in the museums.

976
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:09,010
Scott: Yeah, the same guys are like, you know dynamiting giant Buddhas and shit.

977
01:00:09,211 --> 01:00:19,205
Rym: So they took all these artifacts as many of them as they could and they hid them in safes In I believe like under the government house like I forget the whole story.

978
01:00:19,225 --> 01:00:28,276
Rym: they found safe places Yeah, so they hid all these artifacts and once the US and the war liberated Afghanistan from the Taliban they found them.

979
01:00:28,576 --> 01:00:35,036
Rym: they found these things and they're like, oh fuck then they were actually filling in huge gaps in our History of that region.

980
01:00:35,057 --> 01:00:38,128
Scott: now that we get what was Afghanistan like before right?

981
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,519
Scott: Cuz Afghanistan is basically, you know shit.

982
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:45,290
Scott: It's been a really bad place for a long ass time right decades and decades.

983
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:49,289
Scott: So knowing anything about it from olden times is like what fucking Alexander the Great type.

984
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:49,550
Scott: shit.

985
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:53,870
Rym: Yeah, a lot of Greek artifacts and Greek diffusion in that area.

986
01:00:53,971 --> 01:00:54,577
Scott: It's like who is that?

987
01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:55,950
Scott: You know, we don't know too much.

988
01:00:55,970 --> 01:01:00,910
Scott: Well now we know from these artifacts and there was all kinds of interesting stories within all of that one.

989
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:03,238
Rym: There was this amazing collapsible crown.

990
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,305
Scott: Oh, yeah, that thing was great.

991
01:01:05,565 --> 01:01:09,062
Rym: that thing you could like take the end the Mongols I've read have some similar type of.

992
01:01:09,263 --> 01:01:14,682
Scott: a lot of this stuff was like yeah Nomad group here and this trading Silk Road group there.

993
01:01:14,722 --> 01:01:20,530
Rym: This is obviously a Greek coin that got here at some point Yeah, and all kinds of like Marco Polo shit going on.

994
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:28,788
Rym: But there was one bit where they they excavated this tomb and it looked like it was a king of some nomadic tribe And he was buried with a bunch of his wives something like that.

995
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:35,990
Rym: But the diagram and the artifacts showed that you know, it was all about him, but they buried him in the side of a hill.

996
01:01:36,852 --> 01:01:43,087
Rym: What they didn't realize was that that hill was actually an even more ancient temple that we know.

997
01:01:43,488 --> 01:01:44,310
Rym: fuck all about.

998
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:52,450
Scott: that'd be like if you buried me in the pyramids in Egypt and then a Long time passed and then people came and said oh this must have been a tomb to Scott.

999
01:01:52,931 --> 01:01:53,574
Scott: Wait a minute.

1000
01:01:53,614 --> 01:01:54,135
Rym: Wait a minute.

1001
01:01:54,155 --> 01:01:54,717
Rym: Wait a minute.

1002
01:01:54,737 --> 01:01:57,727
Scott: Scott is nowhere nearly as old as this fucking pyramid.

1003
01:01:57,827 --> 01:01:58,610
Scott: What the fuck?

1004
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:02,307
Rym: That was just a really interesting exhibit.

1005
01:02:02,528 --> 01:02:07,830
Scott: So Look at for if it travels to your country or if you live there that's worth paying to check out.

1006
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,738
Rym: Yeah, I'll try to find a link but it was like the treasure.

1007
01:02:09,779 --> 01:02:12,893
Rym: lost treasures of the Taliban something something It's it wasn't.

1008
01:02:12,913 --> 01:02:13,294
Scott: lost treasures.

1009
01:02:13,315 --> 01:02:14,239
Scott: the Taliban lost treasures.

1010
01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:16,630
Rym: Afghanistan lost treasures hidden from the Taliban.

1011
01:02:16,891 --> 01:02:19,803
Rym: Yeah made a big deal about how it was saved from the Taliban.

1012
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:20,666
Scott: very worth seeing.

1013
01:02:20,686 --> 01:02:25,506
Scott: the rest of the museum Kind of worth seeing at least the Australian history for us non Australians.

1014
01:02:25,587 --> 01:02:32,485
Rym: But yeah, I like You know when we go to the museum part Both science museums, we don't need to see that.

1015
01:02:32,545 --> 01:02:33,168
Scott: Yeah, I don't.

1016
01:02:33,229 --> 01:02:35,635
Scott: any part I really wanted to see which is the Aboriginal stuff.

1017
01:02:35,936 --> 01:02:36,979
Scott: renovation closed.

1018
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:50,337
Rym: Yep, wah-wah, but like when I go to the museum's here like the Natural History Museum in the art museum, especially the art museum has areas like here's a whole bunch of silverware From different eras.

1019
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:51,944
Rym: Mm-hmm giant racks of it.

1020
01:02:51,985 --> 01:02:53,130
Rym: I usually kind of ignore that stuff.

1021
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:54,917
Rym: I love that stuff it depends.

1022
01:02:55,399 --> 01:03:00,841
Rym: but Australia they had sort of Artifacts of culture from like the 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s and that was fascinating.

1023
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:06,872
Scott: Well, that's I'm as you go to a modern museum as well as an ancient music exactly But it was.

1024
01:03:07,153 --> 01:03:10,350
Rym: it was all a lot like the stuff in the US but cooked slightly.

1025
01:03:10,491 --> 01:03:14,650
Scott: So look as you're looking at like that silverware stuff is in the Met which is all old stuff.

1026
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:18,470
Scott: Yeah, if you go to other museums, you'll see more newer stuff.

1027
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:23,460
Scott: Anyway, do we have anything else to cover on our little things?

1028
01:03:23,481 --> 01:03:24,464
Scott: We forgot things.

1029
01:03:24,504 --> 01:03:25,126
Rym: we forgot.

1030
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:26,530
Rym: Let's see people say no worries a lot.

1031
01:03:26,631 --> 01:03:27,619
Rym: I think we covered that up.

1032
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:30,435
Rym: Oh Spiking you.

1033
01:03:30,957 --> 01:03:31,840
Rym: we went to the zoo.

1034
01:03:32,182 --> 01:03:34,470
Rym: The zoo was actually super well designed pretty good.

1035
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:38,242
Rym: Yeah, I was very impressed with the Melbourne Zoo probably better than the Bronx.

1036
01:03:38,322 --> 01:03:46,210
Rym: Ooh, maybe I think maybe I think it might be Because it was built more recently and maybe renovated extensively also because the selection of animals was different.

1037
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:58,190
Rym: But the zoo was just arranged in a really good fashion to get people to go from exhibit to exhibit to exhibit Rather than having sort of like main walking areas.

1038
01:03:58,331 --> 01:04:07,010
Rym: And then here's the side path to exhibit a in and out of that exhibit It was more like to go anywhere you walk through exhibits to get to other exhibits.

1039
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:19,329
Rym: So even if you no matter what you do You're gonna pass by a lot of interesting things and I think it was designed To make people see things that they probably would enjoy but wouldn't think to go see.

1040
01:04:20,132 --> 01:04:24,850
Rym: Like if you want to go see the Tigers you had to go through a lot of other exhibits to get to the Tigers.

1041
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,624
Scott: Those Tigers are mad sad there.

1042
01:04:26,644 --> 01:04:37,990
Rym: Well, yeah Zoos are always both fascinating and sad at the same time like yeah brown bear You're probably way more bored here than you would be if you were out in the wilderness, but you know, you're not doing too badly.

1043
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,116
Scott: It's not like they're mistreating you.

1044
01:04:39,257 --> 01:04:41,730
Scott: But yeah, you're bored and some of the animals are having a good time.

1045
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:44,330
Scott: Butterflies are having a good time.

1046
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:46,539
Rym: We realized something that we thought about off and on.

1047
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,190
Rym: but being at the zoo because you know, I've been to a lot of zoos.

1048
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:52,199
Rym: I'm 30 something years old 31 years old.

1049
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:56,510
Rym: Zoos take on a whole different character.

1050
01:04:57,672 --> 01:05:03,084
Scott: When you are now also into photography Yeah, the animals are actually sitting still.

1051
01:05:03,104 --> 01:05:03,929
Scott: this is way easy.

1052
01:05:04,272 --> 01:05:08,764
Rym: I mean when I go to a zoo now It's like I'll go to the place where there's penguins.

1053
01:05:08,844 --> 01:05:10,754
Rym: and it's like all right penguins You're cool.

1054
01:05:11,056 --> 01:05:11,739
Rym: and two minutes later.

1055
01:05:11,759 --> 01:05:12,885
Rym: I walk away now.

1056
01:05:13,026 --> 01:05:13,770
Rym: It's all right.

1057
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:20,170
Rym: I'm gonna stand here for a full five minutes trying to get pictures of these penguins with all my different lenses.

1058
01:05:20,692 --> 01:05:21,617
Rym: And oh look at that one.

1059
01:05:21,637 --> 01:05:22,300
Rym: He's behind a thing.

1060
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,124
Rym: I can get this shot.

1061
01:05:23,405 --> 01:05:23,707
Rym: Oh shit.

1062
01:05:23,727 --> 01:05:24,450
Rym: That was moving click.

1063
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:29,209
Scott: Yeah, photography is a complementary geekery.

1064
01:05:29,491 --> 01:05:35,650
Scott: It is the kind you know, if you try to pick up a new geekery say I don't know being a techno DJ, right?

1065
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,496
Scott: Well suddenly that's its own thing.

1066
01:05:37,536 --> 01:05:45,370
Scott: That doesn't really partner well with other things as it may be conventions Really, you know, so you can't like do it while you're doing something else you have to dedicate time to it.

1067
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:46,690
Scott: It takes away from other geekeries.

1068
01:05:47,252 --> 01:05:51,206
Scott: But if you do photography you basically just combine that with every fucking thing you do.

1069
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:52,410
Scott: Oh video games and photography.

1070
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:59,258
Scott: Yep board games and photography peeping photography conventions photography Just you do it all the same.

1071
01:05:59,279 --> 01:06:04,177
Scott: you combine it with everything so it doesn't take up any time Other than editing the photos, which I don't do.

1072
01:06:04,197 --> 01:06:05,863
Scott: Yep.

1073
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:06,525
Rym: I don't enough.

1074
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:08,029
Rym: I don't do any retouching.

1075
01:06:08,532 --> 01:06:11,870
Rym: All I do is I go through Lightroom and I basically like yes all my pictures.

1076
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:16,088
Rym: I do one pass of all right I flag all the shit ones as shit.

1077
01:06:16,793 --> 01:06:21,316
Rym: Then I go through the ones that aren't shit and I do some cursory Metadata on all of them.

1078
01:06:21,376 --> 01:06:21,557
Rym: like.

1079
01:06:21,939 --> 01:06:24,129
Rym: these are all from this thing and these are all from this thing.

1080
01:06:24,632 --> 01:06:28,569
Rym: And I go through one more time and I star the ones that are actually good pictures and then you upload them.

1081
01:06:28,912 --> 01:06:33,543
Rym: Then I upload almost all of them because whatever Flicker I got to do some uploading soon.

1082
01:06:33,563 --> 01:06:34,810
Scott: I haven't uploaded a long time.

1083
01:06:36,171 --> 01:06:37,877
Rym: Everything up to the Australia trip.

1084
01:06:37,918 --> 01:06:38,520
Rym: I have uploaded.

1085
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,243
Scott: I got to check out.

1086
01:06:39,303 --> 01:06:40,227
Scott: I got a lot of old stuff.

1087
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:40,950
Scott: That's unuploaded.

1088
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:47,050
Rym: Yeah, I got a bunch of video and stuff that I haven't uploaded but whatever anyway, um we went to all the game stores.

1089
01:06:47,511 --> 01:06:51,003
Scott: Yeah, we checked out all the nerds in in Australia the game store.

1090
01:06:51,043 --> 01:06:52,347
Rym: People are super chill.

1091
01:06:52,467 --> 01:07:00,889
Scott: like we went to The main story went to his games laboratory, which is funny because they were closed during packs They only signs in the window like closed blame packs.

1092
01:07:01,632 --> 01:07:08,797
Scott: It was mostly a magic the gathering store, but they also had a board game selection and support game events and Mostly the store was just tables.

1093
01:07:08,877 --> 01:07:14,096
Scott: It was the exact opposite of a New York game store, which is mostly Merchandise stacked to the ceiling and no tables.

1094
01:07:14,116 --> 01:07:24,710
Scott: this place was like 90% tables with like a super good system of like showing you the tournament Status on the monitor these TVs and you know and very little merchandise for sale except magic cards.

1095
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:25,776
Scott: And the guy was actually giving.

1096
01:07:25,796 --> 01:07:32,470
Scott: not only were they trying to sell this dude magic cards when I was there They're actually giving like deck advice and it's like whoa, this is kind of crazy.

1097
01:07:34,071 --> 01:07:36,504
Scott: But yeah, I played a netrunner tournament there after Rym left.

1098
01:07:36,564 --> 01:07:38,795
Scott: It was a beginner's tournament So I came in third place.

1099
01:07:38,915 --> 01:07:41,687
Scott: cuz that's you know, I can only come in third place as well see beginners.

1100
01:07:41,707 --> 01:07:44,379
Scott: Yeah And I actually lost to some beginners.

1101
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,086
Scott: He was great, you know, whatever.

1102
01:07:46,668 --> 01:07:49,155
Scott: but Yeah, it was a it was a good time.

1103
01:07:49,235 --> 01:07:53,690
Scott: Lots of nice Australian netrunner players, you know, it was a. you know, that was it.

1104
01:07:54,111 --> 01:08:03,529
Scott: Yeah, I have to say that the nerds we ran into were generally all super chill and everyone who's a nerd is busy super Desperate because yep, not enough nerdery like we went to them.

1105
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:14,368
Scott: That was it minotaur which is sort of like the big fancy conflict store the Midtown comics I would say or the Newberry comics of Melbourne and everything there was way expensive.

1106
01:08:14,388 --> 01:08:18,529
Scott: and Yeah, everyone there was super desperate willing to pay that much money.

1107
01:08:19,031 --> 01:08:27,710
Rym: But at the same time that store in terms of its breadth of geekery Was way more than an equivalent store in the u.s.

1108
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:28,152
Rym: I don't know.

1109
01:08:28,171 --> 01:08:30,685
Scott: it had about the same kind of stuff as a Forbidden Planet would have.

1110
01:08:30,725 --> 01:08:31,450
Rym: yeah forbidden planet.

1111
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:32,755
Rym: But that's kind of an exception.

1112
01:08:32,795 --> 01:08:33,157
Rym: go to like.

1113
01:08:33,176 --> 01:08:35,426
Rym: look at uh, what is the Newberry comics?

1114
01:08:35,728 --> 01:08:36,310
Scott: It's about the same.

1115
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:39,823
Rym: Yeah, Newberry comics does not have the breadth of this place.

1116
01:08:39,863 --> 01:08:41,006
Rym: This place didn't?

1117
01:08:41,027 --> 01:08:45,350
Scott: they had the The quantity of inventory, but I think I had about the same breath.

1118
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:50,290
Rym: I think I think the breadth is wider because there were a lot of sections for things.

1119
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:53,481
Scott: The anime was definitely heavier because anime is just big there.

1120
01:08:53,742 --> 01:08:53,923
Rym: Yep.

1121
01:08:54,144 --> 01:08:55,328
Rym: There was a pony section like.

1122
01:08:55,348 --> 01:08:57,256
Rym: there's an area That was basically all pony stuff.

1123
01:08:57,497 --> 01:08:59,630
Rym: There was an area that was basically all Adventure Time stuff.

1124
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:01,870
Rym: There's an area that was all horror movie stuff.

1125
01:09:02,111 --> 01:09:05,448
Rym: There was an area that was like trauma you kind of stuff separate from all of that.

1126
01:09:05,932 --> 01:09:08,062
Rym: Like it was all nerd stuff together.

1127
01:09:08,122 --> 01:09:09,750
Scott: Everything was a zillion dollars.

1128
01:09:09,991 --> 01:09:12,642
Rym: Yeah buy anything, but they were Australian dollars which cost.

1129
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:14,630
Rym: they're worth about the same as American dollars.

1130
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:20,410
Scott: So yeah, yeah, and there's nothing I couldn't get because I live in fucking New York City, and I have amazon.com.

1131
01:09:20,711 --> 01:09:22,077
Rym: Yeah, I didn't an eBay.

1132
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:23,705
Rym: That's why I didn't buy many souvenirs.

1133
01:09:23,865 --> 01:09:31,029
Rym: I bought that cute little Melbourne Zoo Bowl that has the cute little elephant on it, but my mom magnet cuz she likes refrigerated magnets.

1134
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,055
Rym: Oh, yeah, it's her thing.

1135
01:09:32,156 --> 01:09:32,960
Scott: whatever all right.

1136
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,910
Rym: I think we've talked enough about Austria.

1137
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:38,314
Scott: I'm sure there are other things we could mention But the show is long.

1138
01:09:38,395 --> 01:09:41,286
Rym: those anecdotes will come up bit by bit as thing.

1139
01:09:41,346 --> 01:09:46,750
Scott: any other anecdotes I mean we went to a jazz club, whatever you know not so significant or interesting.

1140
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:48,962
Rym: Yeah, I mean there are things we do in New York anyway like in New York.

1141
01:09:49,264 --> 01:09:53,959
Rym: We'll go to Williamsburg and go see weird concert somewhere in Melbourne.

1142
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,770
Rym: we went to Fitzroy which is hipster town the Williamsburg of Melbourne.

1143
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,758
Rym: Yes, everyone's riding fixies there like it.

1144
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:04,550
Scott: if you dropped someone from Williams the French restaurant I wouldn't give us a seat even though it was mostly empty.

1145
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:09,905
Rym: Yeah, either that a big reservation, or they thought we were poor went to the Afghanistan a restaurant.

1146
01:10:09,925 --> 01:10:15,490
Rym: pretty good, Afghanistan e yep I would just say Afghani, maybe it went along with our Afghan exhibit.

1147
01:10:17,676 --> 01:10:26,200
Rym: But yeah Fitzroy all that a lot of the things we did we're really cool and all but there's nothing Particular to say because they're the same things we do in New York.

1148
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,369
Scott: just crook slightly, so we tourists did the end.

1149
01:10:29,489 --> 01:10:38,721
Rym: yeah Australia would go back, but expensive Australia will go back if For work or our Kickstarter succeed.

1150
01:10:38,761 --> 01:10:39,604
Scott: both of those are.

1151
01:10:39,744 --> 01:10:49,370
Scott: if someone pays for yes, that's not me Advertise going to other places not because Australia is bad But because I haven't been to other places and I'd rather go to a new place.

1152
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:50,093
Rym: So here's the thing.

1153
01:10:50,555 --> 01:10:55,277
Rym: this is kind of a meta and will end the show because you know with packs next week I don't think we're gonna do a lot of shows again.

1154
01:10:55,297 --> 01:11:01,329
Rym: No if I go back to Australia I don't have a lot of interest in visiting cities again.

1155
01:11:02,052 --> 01:11:04,539
Scott: I definitely want to go to Outback because the coral reef.

1156
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:09,279
Rym: I travel a lot for work and the more you visit big cities They're all the same.

1157
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:13,560
Rym: there are big differences But not enough to be worth traveling.

1158
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,387
Scott: I want to see old shit.

1159
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:17,669
Rym: Yeah, well There's not a lot of old stuff in Australia.

1160
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:20,623
Scott: That's I got is the only things to see in Australia are natural shit.

1161
01:11:20,683 --> 01:11:25,258
Rym: if I go back to Australia for Reaps and animals in the Outback after packs.

1162
01:11:25,559 --> 01:11:27,685
Rym: I'm gonna go to Wilson's fucking promontory.

1163
01:11:27,705 --> 01:11:28,588
Scott: I was already there.

1164
01:11:28,608 --> 01:11:29,270

01:11:47,274 --> 01:11:51,340
Rym: But I have no desire to visit Canberra And I actually don't really want to bother going.

1173
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,625
Scott: no one wants to visit Canberra.

1174
01:11:52,946 --> 01:11:57,870
Scott: rather than going to Sydney I go to Sydney like as a stop and go to an opera and then leave yeah something like that.

1175
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:59,650
Rym: I would not stay in Sydney for that a couple days.

1176
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:06,517
Rym: Yeah But what I really want to do is arrange ahead of time and do like a week-long Trek through the Outback.

1177
01:12:06,537 --> 01:12:07,682
Scott: I don't know if I gonna go there for a week.

1178
01:12:08,184 --> 01:12:12,961
Rym: Ah if I go back With Kickstarter, I'm gonna spend the same amount of money.

1179
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:15,450
Rym: I spent going on my own on extra fine.

1180
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:19,930
Scott: I'm going to the I'm going to the Outback for like maybe a day just to see up.

Scott: I seen the Outback and then I'm gonna lay on the beach near the coral reef and also go in the coral reef for like A week, I don't want to do too much laying on beach because I can do that in South America much more easily.

1182
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:31,708
Scott: That Beach does not have a coral reef.

1183
01:12:32,373 --> 01:12:33,760
Rym: There's some beaches down there right.

1184
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,570
Scott: imagine if you're like you're in wildwood land on the beach.

1185
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:37,396
Scott: Ah only it's warmer and nicer.

1186
01:12:37,938 --> 01:12:39,323
Scott: ah and the people are more beautiful.

1187
01:12:39,483 --> 01:12:46,509
Scott: ah and when you look at the water It's blue and this beautiful multicolored fishes and not this dark green nasty water.

1188
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,237
Rym: Scott I can go to Turks and Caicos and have that.

1189
01:12:48,759 --> 01:12:51,410
Scott: Turks and Caicos is like the super richest people on earth at it.

1190
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:52,112
Scott: You can't go there.

1191
01:12:52,192 --> 01:12:53,015
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty.

1192
01:12:53,156 --> 01:12:55,022
Rym: you can go there as tourists pretty cheaply.

1193
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:57,590
Scott: It's a lot of monies cheaper than Australia.

1194
01:12:58,054 --> 01:13:01,149
Scott: Well, maybe because it's physically closer I'll go to the Bahamas.

1195
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,118
Scott: Yeah, Bahamas have other problems.

1196
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:05,946
Rym: Yeah, all these places have problems.

1197
01:13:06,669 --> 01:13:11,302
Rym: Yeah I'm just saying I'm not that interested in beach time.

1198
01:13:11,382 --> 01:13:13,773
Scott: I'm super interested in all coral reefs I want to like.

1199
01:13:13,913 --> 01:13:20,550
Rym: I want to hike out to fucking iris rock and then wait and do crazy stuff out there And I want to see the iris rock, but only I want to see the coral reef.

1200
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,360
Rym: I want to go to New Zealand and go skiing there.

1201
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,809
Scott: You know any other good coral reefs to check out?

1202
01:13:25,293 --> 01:13:26,989
Scott: The Great Barrier Reef, I guess that's the one.

1203
01:13:27,009 --> 01:13:27,090
Rym: yeah.

1204
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:31,990
Rym: Any other ones not that I can think of that are bigger and better well-known than the Great Barrier Reef.

1205
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:35,125
Rym: Well, then maybe I should go check that one out, but you're not gonna go scuba diving.

1206
01:13:35,145 --> 01:13:36,190
Rym: So what's the fucking point?

1207
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:36,774
Scott: Why wouldn't I?

1208
01:13:37,178 --> 01:13:38,710
Rym: I thought you were the one who was like a scuba?

1209
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:39,557
Rym: You just want to snorkel.

1210
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,568
Scott: snorkeling is good, too.

1211
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:43,025
Rym: Yeah, if you're gonna go to the Great Barrier Reef, you got a scuba dive.

1212
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:43,810
Rym: I mean, it's not that deep.

1213
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:45,216
Scott: You can probably just see it from the edge.

1214
01:13:45,558 --> 01:13:47,084
Rym: Yeah, you can see more if you scuba dive.

1215
01:13:47,386 --> 01:14:02,324
