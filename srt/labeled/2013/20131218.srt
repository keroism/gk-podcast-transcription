1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,877
Rym: It's Wednesday, December 18th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,160
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:13,464
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:17,029
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, the anime Silver Spoon.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,668
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:32,560
Rym: So on my way home from work today, I encountered a man derping about with an m4 carbine.

7
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:36,333
Scott: Why would a guy be allowed to have that in Manhattan?

8
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,260
Rym: Well, actually it was in New Jersey.

9
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:40,968
Rym: I was in New Jersey doing a thing.

10
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:41,632
Rym: I had to go home.

11
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:42,959
Scott: So where in New Jersey was this?

12
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:45,492
Rym: Like exchange place where that path station is.

13
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,798
Scott: You're just allowed to have m4s there?

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,229
Rym: Well, it was one of those.

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,139
Rym: And allowed to derp with them?

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,020
Scott: I mean, so it was one thing to walk down the street holding a gun or having one in a holster.

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,609
Rym: Yeah, so it was path, like security.

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,523
Rym: Like, you know how in Grand Central there's like a military dude.

19
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:58,970
Scott: Oh, so it's a guy who was supposed to have one.

20
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,914
Rym: Yeah, with m4s.

21
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:00,960
Rym: They kind of hang around sometimes.

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,000
Scott: Why was he derping with it, getting ready to shoot someone and get all over the evening news?

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:05,582
Rym: Here's what derped.

24
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:12,019
Rym: There were two of these guys and they're walking and talking and doing their thing and there's a ton of people with guns like that all around.

25
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:13,805
Rym: So I'm kind of walking slow.

26
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,450
Rym: Like something's not going on, is it?

27
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,520
Rym: Because there's like heavily armored cop cars everywhere.

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,904
Rym: There's cops everywhere.

29
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:28,620
Rym: They're all heavily armed, but they're all kind of walking around and joking and in the end I guess it was probably like a training or maybe it was like new guys first day on the job.

30
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,054
Rym: I don't know.

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:45,537
Rym: So I go into the path station and in front of me two guys with m4s are kind of walking and the first one goes through the revolving door and then like the guns a little too long for the small revolving door and it like everything all bangs together and he gets kind of half stuck and has to like back his way out.

32
00:01:45,557 --> 00:02:01,940
Rym: and as this happens the guy walking behind him I see him reach out like he's gonna be like yo dog don't go in the revolving door and then he just turns to the left ignores the guy who gets derped and stuck in the sliding door walks around to the regular door laughing to himself.

33
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:21,920
Rym: So the moral is if you have to get away from guys who are I don't want to say Renicoffs, but people with m4s who carry them around but don't use them all the time or longer guns even if you can get through a revolving door, they might not be able to easily follow you unless there's a non revolving door nearby.

34
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:24,789
Scott: Was it a glass revolving door?

35
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,779
Rym: Oh, yeah, he could probably try to shoot me through it.

36
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:30,189
Scott: Yeah, or just shoot the glass and run through.

37
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,258
Rym: That would actually be kind of hard because the it was one of those kind of narrow revolving doors.

38
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:42,680
Rym: Mostly it was the idea that he didn't connect the fact kind of like a dog who has a bone that's too big and he can't get through the dog door.

39
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,937
Scott: It's a cop who doesn't use hold it vertically in front of you.

40
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:47,600
Scott: Wouldn't that be enough?

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,860
Rym: I guess he could have but it's kind of like he didn't think about it.

42
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,490
Rym: He didn't think about these two different parts of his life.

43
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,140
Scott: No different than if you had say an umbrella or a sword.

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,895
Rym: But you're generally holding umbrellas vertically all the time even when they're closed or open.

45
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:03,698
Rym: You're not holding your gun vertically you're holding it at the ready.

46
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:06,400
Scott: At the ready for a big danger in New Jersey.

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,160
Rym: Yeah, well, you know they have that like kind of sideways holster where it kind of hangs there.

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,755
Rym: But yeah, basically I think the my bone is too big was not connected to the.

49
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:18,619
Rym: I'm about to walk through a revolving door parts of his brain.

50
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:20,966
Rym: Yeah, much more fun.

51
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:23,736
Rym: I got food poisoning over the weekend.

52
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:24,760
Scott: Oh, it's a shame.

53
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,893
Rym: Yeah, skiing at Hunter Mountain, which was awesome.

54
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:29,380
Rym: There was crazy blizzard snow.

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,689
Scott: It's the number one most fate made fun of lowest quality.

56
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,412
Scott: rent a mountain.

57
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:36,180
Rym: The thing is it's actually the highest quality mountain around.

58
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Scott: Except everyone else except you says differently.

59
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:40,780
Rym: Who?

60
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,569
Rym: Who would ever say that?

61
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,920
Rym: The mountains around New York City suck fucking balls.

62
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,323
Scott: That's what they're saying.

63
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:50,771
Scott: But these are people who like go to Vermont and Colorado.

64
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:51,132
Scott: Yeah.

65
00:03:51,574 --> 00:03:53,460
Rym: Well, I also go to places like Vermont.

66
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:54,540
Rym: It's way better there.

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:02,380
Rym: But within a reasonable drive of New York City, Hunter Mountain is so much better than every other mountain that's within a reasonable drive.

68
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:02,721
Scott: Yes.

69
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:06,260
Scott: At my house, Time Warner Cable is the best Internet service you can get.

70
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:10,040
Rym: No, it's actually a pretty good mountain, especially if you want to train.

71
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,792
Rym: Like it has reasonably difficult terrain.

72
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:12,820
Rym: The back mountain is pretty good.

73
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:20,600
Rym: So if you want to train or practice without wasting your like nice fancy ski trips somewhere better and bigger, it's a great place to ski.

74
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,747
Rym: It's actually a really good place.

75
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,900
Scott: You've never even skied.

76
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,789
Scott: No, I'm just saying what other people say.

77
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:26,171
Scott: Who?

78
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:27,620
Rym: Who has said that that you know?

79
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,809
Scott: People at my work?

80
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,620
Scott: Name anyone.

81
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,927
Scott: People at my work.

82
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:32,640
Rym: What did they actually say about Hunter Mountain?

83
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,180
Scott: They were like, yeah, I really want to go skiing, but I'm going to go shitty Hunter Mountain.

84
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,103
Rym: All right.

85
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:38,709
Rym: So I take it.

86
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:39,980
Rym: they're taking an entire weekend.

87
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,120
Scott: And I said my friend goes there and they're like, yeah, that place is so low rent.

88
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,947
Scott: I'm going to Vermont.

89
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:45,200
Rym: All right.

90
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,840
Rym: It's actually for where in Vermont?

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,382
Rym: Killington.

92
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:51,060
Rym: Killington is a pretty good mountain, but the terrain's not better.

93
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,008
Rym: It's just a bigger mountain.

94
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,260
Scott: I don't know where they went in Vermont.

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,900
Scott: I think some place where they like friend had a cab and some shit.

96
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,283
Scott: I don't know.

97
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:58,000
Rym: OK, that doesn't really narrow it down.

98
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,464
Rym: I don't know.

99
00:04:58,626 --> 00:04:59,740
Rym: Killington's where most people go.

100
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,739
Rym: It's where most people know about.

101
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,280
Rym: But Hunter Mountain is pretty seriously.

102
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,659
Rym: There's a bunch of other skiing around here.

103
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,880
Rym: But I can take a bus in the morning to the mountain ski and take a bus back home.

104
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:18,660
Rym: And on that bus back home, despite the best conditions Hunter Mountains had in like five years, because it actually snowed, there was I ate some pizza.

105
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,006
Scott: And on this bus.

106
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:20,999
Scott: Where did this pizza come from?

107
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,645
Rym: Hunter Mountain.

108
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,840
Rym: Hunter Mountain's cafeteria.

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,580
Scott: OK.

110
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:31,660
Rym: So two hours later, I wake up on the bus and the movie Down Periscope with Kelsey Grammer is playing on the TV really loudly.

111
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:33,418
Rym: And I feel kind of nauseous.

112
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:36,635
Rym: So I'm wondering, am I just sick?

113
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:37,319
Rym: What's going on?

114
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,400
Rym: And then I cartoon vomit.

115
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,620
Rym: You know, when someone vomits the cartoon, their cheeks go like, whoop, that happened.

116
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:45,048
Scott: OK, so.

117
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:46,980
Scott: So I swallowed it all.

118
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:54,640
Rym: And then I staggered to the back of the bus and vomited a copious amount of pizza into the bus.

119
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,500
Scott: Now, do you know for sure that it was food poisoning visa?

120
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,620
Scott: What did you eat for breakfast?

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,853
Rym: So I did not eat breakfast before lunch.

122
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:09,140
Rym: I had chili also at Hunter Mountain, but the chili digested.

123
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:11,309
Rym: I ate the chili at like eleven.

124
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:15,000
Rym: I ate the pizza at like four.

125
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,560
Scott: Well, it doesn't matter which one it was because it was Hunter Mountain food and Hunter Mountain food.

126
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,679
Rym: I got sick at about seven.

127
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,499
Scott: So Hunter Mountain food was guilty no matter what.

128
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,720
Rym: So this is where my odyssey from hell begins, because the bus ride is only supposed to take like two and a half hours.

129
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,918
Scott: But the snow.

130
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,760
Rym: So the snow turned into a blizzard, which delayed the bus heavily.

131
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,679
Scott: Wasn't a blizzard.

132
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,217
Rym: And up there it was.

133
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:42,980
Rym: Scott, I don't think you realize how much more snow they get outside of New York City.

134
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,445
Scott: There was.

135
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,079
Scott: I used to live there.

136
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,359
Rym: Yeah, there was like seven inches of snow up there.

137
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,720
Scott: I lived there for the better part of a decade.

138
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,931
Rym: We used to live in Rochester.

139
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:50,600
Rym: Remember that?

140
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:50,964
Rym: Yeah.

141
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:51,517
Rym: Remember that?

142
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:59,000
Rym: We'd wake up one morning and we'd see our basement window of our basement apartment literally entirely blocked with snow.

143
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:01,039
Rym: I'd wake up and say, hey, Scott, fuck.

144
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,399
Rym: And you yell, fuck.

145
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:03,494
Rym: And then we'd go to school.

146
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:03,859
Rym: Fuck.

147
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,519
Rym: So then the bus broke down.

148
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,519
Scott: All right.

149
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,280
Rym: At like nine o'clock.

150
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,619
Rym: So already I've been on this bus.

151
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,500
Scott: At least you can get off the bus and vomit now.

152
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,480
Rym: No, it broke down on the side of the freeway next to nothing in the middle of a blizzard.

153
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:19,821
Scott: Right.

154
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:22,040
Scott: So you can go out to the nothing and vomit in the nothing.

155
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,519
Rym: No, they wouldn't let us off the bus.

156
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:25,060
Rym: It was dark and dangerous.

157
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,979
Rym: There were cars sliding around in the freeway everywhere and a bus was broken down.

158
00:07:28,602 --> 00:07:30,518
Scott: The bus is guarding you from the slip and slide.

159
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,260
Rym: No, actually, a lot of people get killed by getting out of vehicles that are stopped on the sides of freeways like that.

160
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,176
Scott: Even if you go in.

161
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,600
Scott: I mean, if you go into the road.

162
00:07:37,722 --> 00:07:37,945
Scott: Yeah.

163
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:38,999
Scott: But if you go into the grass.

164
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:39,782
Rym: Yeah.

165
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:40,898
Rym: That's usually where you get hit.

166
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,840
Scott: But as long as you stay with the bus in between you and the highway.

167
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,279
Rym: No, because the bus will get hit and slide into you.

168
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,580
Scott: The bus will just fall on top.

169
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,640
Rym: Also, Scott, there was not much room on the side of the road.

170
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,419
Rym: I looked out there.

171
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,517
Scott: There's enough room for some puke.

172
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,600
Rym: Plus, I could just keep vomiting in the bathroom because it was food poisoning.

173
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,100
Rym: I vomited every like 18 minutes almost to the second.

174
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,800
Scott: How did everyone else feel about the bathroom smelling like vomit?

175
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:06,258
Rym: They were very quiet about it.

176
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:07,680
Scott: They were not also vomiting?

177
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,840
Rym: No, because no one.

178
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:16,960
Rym: So when I first got on the bus, all I could think was I'm so much smarter than all these people because everyone was super hungry and kind of like, oh, my God, I want some food.

179
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:20,820
Rym: And I walked on the bus with the two slices of pizza that I bought at Hunter Mountain.

180
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:22,860
Rym: And I was like, I'm eating this in front of everyone.

181
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:24,899
Rym: I feel so happy.

182
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:32,080
Rym: So the movie downed Periscope looped for the third time.

183
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,438
Scott: Now it's looping.

184
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,316
Rym: It's looping.

185
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:36,639
Scott: No one says anything about that?

186
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,878
Rym: People seem OK with it.

187
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,628
Rym: I don't know if they did.

188
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:39,460
Rym: It was all snowboarders.

189
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,659
Rym: So I imagine they were just high.

190
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,578
Scott: Oh, so they didn't need to.

191
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,559
Rym: I think I was literally the only skier on the bus.

192
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,640
Rym: There's one person thought they knew me and they knew I. was they because I had a Red Wings jersey.

193
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:51,360
Rym: They're like, oh, you're Aaron's friend.

194
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,743
Rym: Right.

195
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,820
Rym: And I was like, maybe.

196
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:55,535
Rym: And she's like from Detroit.

197
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:55,940
Rym: Right.

198
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,880
Rym: The guy from Detroit, Aaron's friend.

199
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:01,880
Rym: I know like three people named Aaron and I am from Detroit.

200
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,900
Rym: And I didn't think that I was wearing the Red Wings jersey.

201
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,098
Rym: So how they would do with that.

202
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:07,637
Rym: So this person thought they knew me.

203
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,279
Rym: So they tried to offer sympathy.

204
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,180
Rym: But then I realized they didn't know me.

205
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,020
Rym: It was hard to back out of that social situation.

206
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:20,800
Rym: And then the bus exploding was great because basically we're driving and suddenly I hear the bus driver go, well, fuck.

207
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,939
Rym: And then white smoke just starts pouring out of the front of the bus.

208
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:29,835
Rym: So the bus stops and everyone in the bus sitting there like, oh, man.

209
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,820
Rym: There are other things that happen on this journey.

210
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,129
Rym: There was Chinese girl who was late to the bus.

211
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,340
Rym: every time you could possibly be late to the bus.

212
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,247
Scott: Why did they wait for her?

213
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,398
Rym: I don't know.

214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,703
Scott: Just leave her there.

215
00:09:41,723 --> 00:09:45,900
Rym: They actually tried to leave her, but then they saw her running after the bus just as they went to leave.

216
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,260
Rym: I mean, you can't just leave when you see them like 10 feet away.

217
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,105
Rym: You know, I would.

218
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:51,589
Scott: I would.

219
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:52,820
Scott: You totally can.

220
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:53,983
Rym: I would.

221
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:56,440
Scott: That'll give them a story and you a story.

222
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,604
Rym: Other highlights involved.

223
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:01,580
Rym: Ten minutes on the road when this obviously stone guy staggers up to the front.

224
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Rym: He's like, yo, bus driver, you could find it in your heart to stop it like a beer store for like 10 minutes.

225
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,820
Rym: We collected a bunch of tips and we'll make sure you get nicely tipped.

226
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,420
Rym: And he's like, you can't drink alcohol on the bus.

227
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:17,219
Rym: And the guy's like, oh, we're not we're not going to buy beer.

228
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:19,820
Rym: And the bus driver is like, you said a beer store.

229
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:23,640
Rym: What did you expect to buy at the beer store?

230
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:29,280
Rym: And the guy was just like, oh, well, sodas and bus drivers like sit down.

231
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:33,860
Scott: The bus driver should have been like, you're not allowed to drive beer on this bus.

232
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,519
Scott: So make sure you only drink beverages and brown paper bags on this bus.

233
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,780
Rym: Dude, I've been on these buses where sometimes they hand everyone a beer as they get back on the bus.

234
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,705
Scott: Right.

235
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:45,720
Rym: So, yeah, that was my weekend.

236
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,438
Rym: Two days of being bedridden, vomiting every 20 minutes.

237
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,004
Rym: That was awesome.

238
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:59,160
Rym: So, Hunter Mountain, I'd like to thank you for probably the fourth best skiing day of my entire life going back and for the ridiculous food poisoning.

239
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:05,479
Rym: I actually was so mad about this that I filed an official complaint form to the New York State Department of Health.

240
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:08,800
Rym: Let me tell you, that website is archaic as fuck.

241
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,038
Rym: And I had to fax this motherfucker over there.

242
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,177
Rym: OK, so, yeah, anime.

243
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:16,220
Scott: Yeah, well, there's some news.

244
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,582
Scott: Right.

245
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:23,000
Scott: And, you know, I know we talk about this a lot on this show, but this is actually almost definitely going to be the last time we talk about it.

246
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:26,520
Scott: Bitcoin's no anime news.

247
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,960
Scott: Nina's anime news.

248
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,259
Scott: Nina is the best webcomic.

249
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,010
Rym: That was my news.

250
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:30,660
Scott: That's yes.

251
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,225
Scott: My news.

252
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:32,479
Rym: That was my news.

253
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,818
Scott: That's a problem, isn't it?

254
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:34,427
Rym: OK.

255
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:34,691
Rym: Yeah.

256
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,723
Scott: Anime news.

257
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:37,660
Scott: Nina, it's been over for a while.

258
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:38,758
Scott: So sad.

259
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:48,300
Scott: But she just today started the Kickstarter to get a physical copy of a book that I assume will contain every single anime news.

260
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,400
Scott: Nina comic ever plus extra stuff.

261
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:53,360
Rym: This is definitely worth getting if you're an anime fan.

262
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,462
Scott: And it's like twenty five bucks just to get to the paper book level, which is totally reasonable.

263
00:11:57,482 --> 00:12:00,300
Rym: I mean, it wasn't the best webcomic ever.

264
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:01,819
Scott: It's just a really good webcomic.

265
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,904
Rym: You know what it's like?

266
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:08,899
Rym: It's like the bad boys of computer science in that for the people it was for, it spoke to us.

267
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,223
Scott: For us?

268
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:10,519
Scott: Yes, it's for us.

269
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,707
Rym: And it also it had that sort of.

270
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:18,779
Rym: it had the level of snark that you so rarely see in an official sponsored webcomic.

271
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:23,179
Scott: Like the comic for I don't know, like NFL comic right now.

272
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,541
Scott: Yeah.

273
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:24,063
Rym: Like or like.

274
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:30,580
Rym: if Nike, the shoe brand, made a comic about shoes, it wouldn't be a comic that made fun of people buying expensive shoes.

275
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,449
Scott: It'd be garbage.

276
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:32,220
Rym: Anime news.

277
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,800
Rym: Nina was the comic that made fun of anime fans.

278
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:35,462
Scott: Yeah.

279
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:39,840
Scott: It's like here's a comic and the art customer news network sponsored by the store.

280
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:45,042
Scott: It's like you go into a GameStop and you buy a comic book and it's the official Gamescom book.

281
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:49,022
Scott: and it makes fun of people like look at these dumbasses selling their games back to GameStop.

282
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:54,659
Scott: They're all poor and they can just sell them on Amazon or just buy them somewhere else to begin begin with.

283
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,020
Scott: But yeah, there's a Kickstarter for it now.

284
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,400
Scott: This is the last anime news, need a thing that will likely ever exist.

285
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:06,340
Scott: So it's the last time we'll talk about it, which is why it's worth talking about.

286
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:14,349
Rym: So I guess in other news, anime news came to an end and it turns out that there's going to be a Kickstarter.

287
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:16,940
Scott: I don't really don't have another news.

288
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:21,860
Rym: I guess I think there's a new My Little Pony mini comic that features Luna coming out.

289
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,290
Scott: No, I mean, there's the.

290
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:23,896
Scott: there's two.

291
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:24,843
Scott: I'm like.

292
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,760
Rym: I'm like scraping Tumblr and Twitter.

293
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,140
Scott: Some people who don't know the IDW prints two different.

294
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,760
Scott: Well, now I think three different My Little Pony comics now.

295
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,041
Scott: Right.

296
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:39,662
Scott: There's My Little Pony Friendship is Magic, which is the, you know, you know, the straight up.

297
00:13:39,682 --> 00:13:45,255
Scott: the comic that is serial and it tells, you know, is stories and is just, you know, the real comic.

298
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:45,418
Scott: Right.

299
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:47,060
Scott: It's the comic of My Little Pony.

300
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:53,120
Scott: Then there's another one that's super new, which is literally just take the TV show and turn it into comics directly.

301
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:54,980
Scott: You don't need to read that if you watch a TV show.

302
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,789
Scott: I'm not buying that shit.

303
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:56,620
Scott: Just a waste of money.

304
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,021
Scott: Right.

305
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:59,860
Scott: There's another one that's My Little Pony Micro Series.

306
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,142
Scott: And the way that works is each issue of it focuses on one character and only one character.

307
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:09,661
Scott: So I guess the Luna issue is coming or is coming out now or as soon or whatever.

308
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:17,639
Scott: But yeah, I'm actually more excited for that series because well, because of this cover here, that is what I saw.

309
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:28,623
Scott: No, but I think what's going to happen, though, is I think either A, the series will end, which will be sad, or B, they'll start digging into the lower and lesser characters more and more.

310
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:32,344
Scott: It'll be like, which could be like, yeah, like the krills and sofas issue.

311
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:32,726
Scott: Right.

312
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:34,580
Scott: It's like, oh, shit, I'm all over that.

313
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,000
Rym: I was about to say that's that's when Moses, like it's his own episode.

314
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,783
Scott: Exactly.

315
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:40,431
Rym: I'm so about Simpsons comics.

316
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:44,339
Scott: for people who don't know, Simpsons comics are not bad and they've been going on for fuck ever.

317
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:48,020
Scott: And they've already done this with pretty much every Simpsons character imaginable.

318
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,340
Scott: I have Professor Frank comics, comes with 3D glasses, but seriously, that work.

319
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,492
Rym: The new season of My Little Pony is fine.

320
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:56,964
Rym: It's good.

321
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:57,511
Rym: I like it.

322
00:14:57,551 --> 00:14:58,139
Rym: I'm watching it.

323
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,440
Scott: It's not Equestria Girls.

324
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,043
Rym: It's good.

325
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:01,960
Rym: It's pretend Equestria Girls didn't exist.

326
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,280
Rym: The My Little Pony comics are ace and you should be reading them.

327
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,020
Rym: Yeah, they are hilarious.

328
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,159
Rym: So anyway, things of the day.

329
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:25,300
Rym: Hey, Scott, back when we were at RIT living in Colony, there was I had a terrible book on the bookshelf and I was really interested in that topic for a time.

330
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,479
Rym: You remember what that book was about?

331
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,444
Scott: Something.

332
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,580
Scott: Oh, is that Egypt alien nonsense?

333
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:37,240
Rym: Yeah, well, so the book was Egypt like basically Egypt research, Egypt research people, some guy who believed aliens built pyramids.

334
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,782
Rym: The problem is he didn't put the aliens into this book until like three quarters of the way through.

335
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:43,180
Rym: You read this book and it's like you believe that shit.

336
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,580
Rym: I did not believe the alien shit.

337
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,280
Scott: You believed it at one point.

338
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:46,942
Rym: Not the alien.

339
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:51,403
Scott: When you got to RIT, you believed all sorts of crazy shit and then you learned you were wrong.

340
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:55,910
Scott: Yeah, because I believe you're believing like that for fairies lived in the woods.

341
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,499
Rym: Here's an example.

342
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:06,400
Rym: I believed because I read all these studies about the great Sphinx and how the great Sphinx was clearly eroded by water at some point and not by sand.

343
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:08,860
Scott: Not by Napoleon's cannon shooting his nose off.

344
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,733
Rym: Then it should have been.

345
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,055
Scott: It wasn't Napoleon's cannon, like Alexander the Great had a cannon somehow.

346
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:23,620
Rym: or that the great pyramid, the complex at Giza, those three pyramids actually are a lot like they have the same arrangement and brightness as Orion's belt.

347
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,280
Rym: And yeah, that stuff's all completely bullshit.

348
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,980
Scott: Anything in a set of three, Orion's belt, but three little pigs, Orion.

349
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:34,999
Rym: So that book was awful.

350
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:40,639
Rym: But the one thing that I learned from it that was real was there was a study, the Upawalt, whatever, it was a project.

351
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,220
Rym: Well, because one thing that is true, there are these shafts in the great pyramid.

352
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:44,882
Scott: Yeah.

353
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,739
Rym: No one really knows exactly what they were for, but they're there.

354
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
Rym: And a long time ago, like in the 90s, people built a robot.

355
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:54,040
Scott: They sent the robots down the shaft.

356
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,783
Scott: Everyone knows this.

357
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:56,191
Rym: And there was a big event on TV.

358
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:58,284
Rym: where they live showed like this is what's here.

359
00:16:58,344 --> 00:16:59,391
Scott: Remember what they found?

360
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,243
Scott: Nothing.

361
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:02,358
Rym: Nope, they found a door.

362
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:09,167
Rym: OK, and they couldn't get past it and there was a little handle on the door and then the robot couldn't go any further.

363
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,980
Rym: And it was basically nothing.

364
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,960
Rym: So even after I realized that book was just by now, nobody's opened the door.

365
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,125
Rym: So I wondered for years if anyone had ever followed up on that study, like what was behind that door?

366
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:24,200
Scott: I can easily open that door now.

367
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,032
Scott: I'm pretty sure everyone.

368
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:25,256
Scott: Yeah.

369
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,440
Rym: So it turns out only recently did anything actually happen with that.

370
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,343
Scott: What did they do?

371
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:33,100
Rym: So another team sent another robot.

372
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,521
Rym: Yeah.

373
00:17:33,602 --> 00:17:34,486
Rym: Made a new robot.

374
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:36,716
Rym: because remember, that first project was in like the 90s.

375
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,580
Rym: Robot technology fucking sucked back.

376
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,372
Scott: They found a robbed tomb.

377
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:42,480
Scott: that's so even grave.

378
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,520
Rym: There's a new robot that was just way better in every way.

379
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,466
Rym: And I found this.

380
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:50,520
Rym: This is like some crazy fan website, but I did check it out.

381
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:58,580
Rym: The graphic design of this site aside, this is the best collection of all the actual pictures and stuff that they found with this new robot in the Great Pyramid.

382
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:00,170
Rym: And they found cool shit.

383
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:01,399
Scott: How cool could it be?

384
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,979
Rym: So behind that door, there was another door.

385
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:04,724
Scott: Nice.

386
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:06,619
Rym: And they drilled a hole in that other door.

387
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:10,722
Rym: And they actually found a bunch of hieroglyphics written in like this red ochre back there.

388
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:10,783
Rym: OK.

389
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:20,542
Rym: And all this other stuff and all the research that they found to date, everything they found since then, which happened in like 2012.

390
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:21,667
Rym: So relatively recently.

391
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,104
Rym: And it looks like it was only disrupted by the troubles in Egypt right now.

392
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,960
Rym: So there's going to be further study.

393
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,520
Rym: But this is actually, if you ever wondered what the deal was with that door, it actually was only recently that we found out anything.

394
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:36,369
Rym: And what we found was pretty cool.

395
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,363
Rym: Like, look, we actually found that there's the final door.

396
00:18:39,404 --> 00:18:43,083
Rym: There's like this blocking slab and it looks like there's space behind it.

397
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:46,380
Rym: And there's these metal loops that are kind of stuck into the back of it.

398
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,077
Rym: that looks like it was used to set them in.

399
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:53,040
Rym: So this is just like this crazy collection of all the pictures and all the detail.

400
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,018
Rym: Like, look, even the raw composites.

401
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,343
Rym: So if you ever cared about the pyramids, here's some of the hieroglyphics they found.

402
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:02,140
Rym: They think they're engineering marks.

403
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:02,864
Scott: Maybe.

404
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,640
Rym: This is actually pretty cool.

405
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,139
Rym: This gives closure to a part of my life.

406
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,190
Rym: I've wondered for so long.

407
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,180
Rym: The fuck was behind that door?

408
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,060
Scott: They didn't find an alien skull?

409
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,602
Rym: Nope.

410
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,279
Rym: They found another door.

411
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,407
Rym: Hooray.

412
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,015
Scott: Door number one.

413
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:19,509
Scott: Here's a quote.

414
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:20,300
Rym: Here's a quote.

415
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,620
Rym: At first glance, the second blocking stone seems to be just a large, relatively rough-hewn block sitting at the end of the U-block.

416
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:34,760
Rym: However, the intriguing thing is that there appear to be red ochre masons marks on both walls at the far end where they meet the second blocking stone.

417
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,138
Scott: This suggests that there's no way humans could have done this.

418
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,778
Rym: Actually, this article is like, humans clearly did this.

419
00:19:45,182 --> 00:20:00,820
Rym: Though the graphic design of this website might lead you to believe otherwise, the project is called, in similarly unpronounceable word to the previous Upawala Hualua project, is the Hawaiian or Egyptian?

420
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:02,360
Rym: The jetty project.

421
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,205
Rym: I guess Jedi.

422
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:06,558
Rym: Maybe it's a Java parameter like -D Jedi.

423
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:07,861
Scott: Anyway.

424
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:09,940
Rym: Anyway, this is pretty cool.

425
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,401
Scott: All right.

426
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:14,668
Rym: So also this robot is so much smaller than the robot they used on that old documentary.

427
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:15,640
Scott: Modern technologies.

428
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,549
Rym: Yeah, I know.

429
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:17,080
Scott: All right.

430
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,879
Scott: So, uh, you know, who out?

431
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:20,685
Scott: Right.

432
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:22,100
Scott: Well, that's definitely Egyptian.

433
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:24,900
Rym: U-P-U-A-U-T was the previous one.

434
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:28,340
Scott: OK, so, you know, Dim Mak, right?

435
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,439
Scott: You just hit a guy in the back of the neck and he dies.

436
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,162
Rym: Yup.

437
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:37,260
Rym: In fact, I remember that video we found where we watched that video and we were both like, did we just watch someone die?

438
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:38,380
Scott: And it's complete horseshit.

439
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:38,963
Scott: Yup.

440
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:40,739
Scott: Basically, people just pretend.

441
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,880
Scott: I mean, well, and it's sort of it's basically hypnotism, right?

442
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,079
Scott: Because people believe in it so much that it works on them.

443
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:47,800
Rym: I mean, I saw that episode of Batman.

444
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:48,789
Scott: Right.

445
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:49,300
Scott: Exactly.

446
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,539
Scott: So that was actually one of the best episodes.

447
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:53,666
Scott: It was.

448
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,760
Scott: And it totally can exist in Batman universe.

449
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,122
Scott: Why not?

450
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:58,558
Rym: It's right up there with that the episode with the giant computer.

451
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:00,330
Scott: Hard act.

452
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,553
Scott: Yeah.

453
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:01,060
Scott: All right.

454
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,420
Scott: So anyway, hard act part two also.

455
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:02,842
Scott: All right.

456
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,440
Rym: So, well, there's apparently some say just hard act part one.

457
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:06,740
Scott: Yeah.

458
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:12,420
Scott: There's another thing besides Dim Mak called EFO, which is Empty Force something.

459
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,080
Rym: What?

460
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:16,360
Scott: Empty Force is even crazier than Dim Mak.

461
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,640
Scott: These guys believe you don't even have to touch someone.

462
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,219
Scott: You basically just like knock them down.

463
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,803
Scott: Well, wait.

464
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:22,640
Rym: I actually studied that at RIT.

465
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,320
Rym: I'm doing it right now to all the listeners.

466
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,840
Scott: Yeah, so it's basically the same idea, right?

467
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:34,979
Scott: Is the of some master of martial arts and he has followers who truly believe in it so much that they're hypnotized into believing it works.

468
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:43,020
Scott: So when he uses this, you know, EFO on them, they actually fall down and believe that, you know, they're not just falling down on purpose.

469
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,680
Rym: There is possibly another explanation.

470
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,417
Rym: They might simply be faking it.

471
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,342
Rym: Bootlickers.

472
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,860
Scott: It's possible that they're all just faking it on purpose anyway.

473
00:21:51,421 --> 00:22:00,210
Scott: So one of these guys, EFO guys, he had like a sort of, I guess, free trial class, like come see a demonstration and see.

474
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:03,680
Scott: if you want to, you know, and if you like it, sign up for my because he's trying to make money.

475
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:03,901
Scott: Right.

476
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,439
Scott: He's like, sign up for my classes and you can learn to do this, too.

477
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:10,540
Scott: So they allowed cameras at this thing, which is unusual.

478
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,540
Rym: Big mistake, dude.

479
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,739
Scott: So some skeptic dudes showed up with their cameras and they're videoing.

480
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,362
Scott: Right.

481
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,059
Scott: And they get up and they're like, oh, can you try it on me?

482
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:20,228
Scott: And he's like, all right.

483
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,620
Scott: And he's like trying it on the guy.

484
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,719
Scott: And it doesn't do anything because he doesn't believe in it.

485
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
Rym: The video is so great.

486
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:27,679
Scott: And then he's like, all right, can I can I push you?

487
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,480
Scott: And he's like pushing the guy around, just like push, push.

488
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:32,679
Scott: And it's like the EFO is not working on him.

489
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,422
Scott: Right.

490
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:38,378
Scott: At the best part is at the end, this dude gets up and he's like, I'm probably the weakest guy in this room.

491
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,024
Scott: Right.

492
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:40,379
Scott: But I can do this.

493
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,060
Scott: And he goes over like a punching bag and just punches it a few times.

494
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,367
Scott: He's like, he's like, if someone comes and does that to you and, you know, the EFO, is that going to stop him?

495
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:49,660
Scott: Can I can I do this to you?

496
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,297
Scott: And he's like, no, you can't do that to me.

497
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:54,078
Scott: And you only use the EFO against me.

498
00:22:54,903 --> 00:22:56,140
Scott: He's like, no, you can't do that.

499
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,819
Scott: We're not going to let you punch me.

500
00:22:58,103 --> 00:22:58,960
Scott: And it's like, oh, really?

501
00:22:59,220 --> 00:22:59,561
Scott: All right.

502
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:04,603
Scott: And then the guy the guy's like, you know, well, you're going to pay for lessons in the EFO.

503
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:08,226
Scott: He's like, I came here, you know, because I was going to sign up for this if it really worked.

504
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,719
Scott: Clearly, it doesn't work.

505
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,840
Scott: Now, if it worked, I totally signed up for this shit.

506
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,399
Scott: I want to knock people over without having to touch them.

507
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,700
Rym: All of you out there, take take this lesson to heart.

508
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:27,440
Rym: If you want to punk people who believe in woo woo, you need to pretend to be earnestly interested and not just shoot them down right away.

509
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,000
Rym: Tell them, play the the ardent believer or the person who wants to believe.

510
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:43,260
Scott: Yeah, it's much better to go in and be like, well, listen, I came here expecting to have all my diseases cured, but I come here and I'm still just as sick as ever.

511
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,398
Scott: In fact, I'm more sick.

512
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,876
Scott: Well, this is a bunch of work.

513
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:48,379
Rym: Yeah, I really want your magic to work.

514
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,740
Scott: How can your magic's not working?

515
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,420
Scott: Don't don't be all like this.

516
00:23:52,903 --> 00:23:55,480
Rym: You know, I do that after the fact, the post-hoc.

517
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:55,762
Scott: Right.

518
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:56,860
Scott: You go in for the faith heal.

519
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,319
Scott: You're like, oh, heal me, faith healer.

520
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,380
Scott: I still have cancer, faith healer.

521
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,247
Scott: You didn't do shit.

522
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:03,359
Scott: I'm dying.

523
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,370
Scott: It's still real.

524
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:05,100
Rym: It hurts even worse.

525
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,787
Scott: Oh, my God.

526
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:06,860
Scott: Oh, it's not helping.

527
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:14,526
Rym: So should you go to the faith healer with fake illnesses and then be like, oh, you made it worse.

528
00:24:14,668 --> 00:24:15,419
Scott: Now I can't see.

529
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,920
Scott: Bring some bring some like, you know, those those blood things with you.

530
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,750
Scott: So it looks like that would be some.

531
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,355
Scott: some like does this thing.

532
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,680
Rym: And then just blood starts.

533
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,323
Scott: No, no.

534
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:30,460
Scott: Have like an Ipaca capsule, like in the corner of your mouth.

535
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,217
Scott: And then once he tries his faith healing, bite into it.

536
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:40,279
Rym: No, you know, the ones who like walk up to you and go like, but bam and knock you down as soon as he does it.

537
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:46,336
Scott: Blood needs to explode from your eyes, your ears and your chest might be like, oh, we got all the bad blood out of his body.

538
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,744
Scott: He's healed.

539
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:51,540
Scott: You can't give him any excuse.

540
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,479
Scott: It's got to be obvious that it that it, you know.

541
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,439
Rym: The vomit, he's vomited out the demon.

542
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:57,439
Rym: You see the problem here?

543
00:24:57,721 --> 00:24:58,529
Scott: Yes, exactly.

544
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,439
Scott: You got to do it just right.

545
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:02,179
Rym: So, yeah, that's pretty awesome.

546
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:07,380
Rym: In the meta moment, the book, the book is Iduru by William Gibson.

547
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:08,290
Scott: I started reading it.

548
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,200
Scott: I read like three chapters.

549
00:25:09,462 --> 00:25:10,679
Rym: I'm most of the way through it again.

550
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,960
Rym: I'm reading it twice.

551
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,546
Rym: I'll see.

552
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:13,177
Rym: I've lapsed.

553
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,399
Scott: Daddy, daddy to pee pee.

554
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,475
Rym: It's if I'd say anything about this book, it is so, so 90s dystopia.

555
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,320
Scott: Sure.

556
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:25,660
Rym: Like this might as well be set in the same world as Strange Days.

557
00:25:26,364 --> 00:25:26,404
Scott: OK.

558
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:27,700
Rym: I like it, though.

559
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:29,599
Rym: I liked it when I read it before and I like it again.

560
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:32,880
Scott: Other meta things.

561
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:42,060
Scott: So we're always hyping up all the places to go and see us on the Internet, like Twitter, YouTube, our website, our forums, our IRC channel, just emailing us the newsletter.

562
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,612
Scott: I haven't sent out in a while that I completely forgot about that.

563
00:25:44,632 --> 00:25:45,355
Scott: I'll send out again, etc.

564
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:54,559
Scott: There is one place I was reminded of today that I forgot existed because I don't really use it, but other people do use it.

565
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:56,219
Scott: That is El Steam group.

566
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:58,799
Scott: There is an official GeekNights steam group.

567
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:01,680
Scott: It has existed since like 07.

568
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,880
Scott: There's like a hundreds of GeekNights listeners in there.

569
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:11,840
Scott: So if you are a loser and you have no one to play steam games with and you need friends to play steam games with, join that steam group called GeekNights.

570
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,149
Scott: It's just a public group.

571
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:13,897
Scott: You can just join it.

572
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:28,777
Scott: And if you see other people are online in that group, you can message them and at least you will have one thing in common, which is that you know who we are and then you can play games together and don't suck at games because a lot of those people are good at games better than us.

573
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:32,959
Rym: Also, we finally do to you guys constantly asking for it.

574
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:41,800
Rym: I've uploaded the entirety of Beyond Dungeons and Dragons as we presented it on Friday at PAX Australia in Melbourne.

575
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:42,483
Scott: All right.

576
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,659
Rym: So it's up there.

577
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,980
Rym: You can watch it in its fullness and more video to come as we have time.

578
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,440
Rym: The production of new episodes of GeekNights presents was somewhat delayed by my food poisoning, so hopefully we'll pick it up sometime shortly after the holidays.

579
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,161
Scott: Yep.

580
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:59,978
Scott: We also have a new show we're going to do.

581
00:27:00,805 --> 00:27:01,108
Rym: Yep.

582
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,319
Scott: You'll see it when it comes.

583
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,359
Rym: It's a new GeekNights presents that I would watch.

584
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,939
Scott: I think we might change the name of it.

585
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,402
Rym: I got some other name ideas, but but at the same time, it's going to be a pretty good brand name.

586
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:15,800
Scott: Well, you know, you want to keep your eye on the Twitch channel.

587
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:16,342
Scott: Yes.

588
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:27,198
Scott: If you follow the Twitch channel, this has been happening to me lately is you'll get messages like on your phone and stuff whenever the Twitch channel goes live and then you know to go and watch.

589
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:29,660
Scott: So do we have a GeekNights Twitch channel?

590
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:30,407
Rym: No, we have.

591
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:31,760
Rym: I have mine and you have your eyes.

592
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:39,039
Scott: I'm going to make a GeekNights one and then I'll tweet it on the GeekNights Twitter and such, and then I'll post it around and everyone follow it.

593
00:27:39,402 --> 00:27:42,180
Scott: And then if we go live on that channel, then you'll know.

594
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,660
Scott: That way, we don't have to tell you what time the show is or anything.

595
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,880
Scott: You just and then, of course, that shit will be on YouTube eventually.

596
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:48,322
Scott: Yep.

597
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:50,820
Rym: In some sort of edited, compiled fashion.

598
00:27:51,241 --> 00:28:02,120
Rym: But rest assured, like other projects we've done, we're excited enough about this one to tell you that it's coming, but not excited enough to tell you what it is because we don't know if it'll actually we got it.

599
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,167
Rym: We got to do a test run.

600
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,780
Scott: We can't shit talk, right?

601
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,959
Scott: Yeah, we just got to make sure it works.

602
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,999
Scott: However, if this works, can we do what we think we want to do?

603
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,843
Rym: I will say this.

604
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:14,180
Rym: Test audiences have found this to be utterly hilarious.

605
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,238
Scott: How many test audiences?

606
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,180
Rym: One, Emily, one, Natalie and Judith, I believe.

607
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:21,719
Rym: OK, they watched one time.

608
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,243
Scott: That's true.

609
00:28:22,645 --> 00:28:24,899
Rym: Plus, there were other similar tests.

610
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:30,080
Rym: In fact, I remember way back, a particular thing involving Spelunky happened.

611
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:31,082
Scott: OK.

612
00:28:31,484 --> 00:28:34,879
Rym: And I remember that being hilarious to the few people who were in the room who weren't you.

613
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:38,789
Rym: Oh, yeah, join our forum.

614
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:40,400
Rym: It's bigger and better than it's ever been.

615
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,400
Rym: Yeah, I'm double saying it because we're paying a lot of money for this forum now.

616
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:43,846
Scott: That's right.

617
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:44,560
Scott: Go to Magfest.

618
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,965
Rym: Oh, Magfest.

619
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,979
Rym: I don't think it's sold out, but the hotel is.

620
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,439
Scott: If you don't go to Magfest.

621
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,822
Rym: Oh, yeah.

622
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:54,219
Rym: And we're going to be at Magfest presenting bad games.

623
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:56,928
Rym: Games 10 and 20, 10 and 30 years from now.

624
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,640
Rym: Video game controllers will be on that panel and Scott will be on that panel.

625
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,858
Scott: And I'll see how that panel goes.

626
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,718
Rym: Privacy and games.

627
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,139
Scott: And it's sitting on that panel instead of another panel.

628
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,040
Rym: I'm going to be I'm going to pick one of the panels we're on and just be super adversarial.

629
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:18,580
Rym: Like whatever position the Zeitgeist takes in the room, I'm just going to take the exact opposite.

630
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,060
Scott: I don't think the game controllers panel will necessarily be bad, but basically right now it has no focus.

631
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,000
Scott: Like every each there's so many things to talk about when it comes to controllers that you could talk for days about just like one controller.

632
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,461
Scott: Right.

633
00:29:29,882 --> 00:29:36,740
Scott: So, you know, it's like each person has like a different thing they want to talk about and there's no real unifying idea.

634
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,900
Scott: So I'm basically just going to sit there and, you know, say whatever comes to mind.

635
00:29:41,141 --> 00:29:45,720
Rym: Well, the privacy in games one, the discussion on what to talk about took about a half hour.

636
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:48,719
Rym: And we all agree there's an agenda and it looks really fun.

637
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:52,200
Rym: And games 10 to 30 years from now, you saw that email.

638
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,145
Rym: I got to respond to that.

639
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:55,819
Rym: I don't want I don't want the audience to interact at all.

640
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,943
Rym: No, I got to make.

641
00:29:57,204 --> 00:30:01,920
Rym: So when I send the email saying, yo, I don't want the audience to interact.

642
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,500
Rym: I want you to also say that so that we have enough people saying that to override the people who want audience interaction.

643
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,083
Scott: Of course.

644
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:10,773
Rym: Otherwise, I'm going to be it.

645
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,637
Rym: Guys, listeners, if you're at Magfest, I will tell you if audience interaction is going to happen at that panel.

646
00:30:17,657 --> 00:30:18,520
Rym: we don't want it to happen in.

647
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:27,480
Rym: If it does, I warn you, I want you to show up and interact awesomely and I mean, destroy the panel.

648
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:32,400
Rym: So recall a while ago we did that panel at Anime Boston.

649
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,698
Rym: We reviewed the season of anime before it came out.

650
00:30:35,422 --> 00:30:37,780
Rym: One of the shows we talked about was Silver Spoon.

651
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:49,499
Scott: And we looked at that one and we prejudged it based on a JPEG and a short paragraph description that it was a show with some serious quality potential, because A, did not look perverted in any way.

652
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:54,339
Scott: B, was not a typical anime fighting kind of plot of shallowness.

653
00:30:56,181 --> 00:31:02,480
Scott: And C, it looked bright and colorful and happy times, but not, you know, totally wacky and crazy kid show time.

654
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,359
Rym: Yes, straight up based on a manga, not a light novel, probably not too porny.

655
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:08,223
Scott: So, yeah.

656
00:31:08,264 --> 00:31:13,220
Scott: So Silver Spoon is not a sitcom from the 80s about.

657
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:17,280
Rym: I was going to make a Silver Spoons joke later.

658
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,359
Scott: A kid so rich he had his own pinball machine and shit.

659
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:27,252
Rym: So really, what we said is that we expected this to be one of those sort of sort of slice of life.

660
00:31:27,532 --> 00:31:31,360
Rym: camaraderie shows that simultaneously was going to teach you stuff about farms.

661
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:33,718
Rym: And it is it is that to a T.

662
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:40,340
Scott: Well, I don't know if it's necessarily the it's not super slice of life because there is a plot, right?

663
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,480
Rym: The plot is that resolved itself already.

664
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:43,126
Scott: That's right.

665
00:31:43,146 --> 00:31:44,660
Scott: We'll get to get to that.

666
00:31:44,761 --> 00:31:44,962
Scott: Right.

667
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:46,919
Scott: But the plot is basically have this kid.

668
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:49,619
Scott: He's going to high school for whatever reason.

669
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:51,129
Scott: He gets ready.

670
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,320
Scott: He doesn't want to be near his parents.

671
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,120
Scott: He wanted to get as far away from his parents as he could.

672
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,800
Scott: So he went to a boarding school and his teacher from his middle school figured out that he should go to this farm school.

673
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:01,426
Scott: So he went there.

674
00:32:01,446 --> 00:32:02,920
Scott: He had no interest in farming whatsoever.

675
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:04,303
Scott: And he gets there.

676
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:11,220
Scott: And everyone else who's there is someone who wants to do farming or is like works on a farm or lives on a farm or is a farmer.

677
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,320
Scott: And they're like, one girl is like, I want to make cheese.

678
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:14,607
Scott: That's what I'm going to do in my life.

679
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,860
Rym: And that girl is the second cutest girl in the show.

680
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,281
Scott: Yeah.

681
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,060
Scott: And I mean, the girl you're supposed to like is the cutest.

682
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,462
Scott: Yeah.

683
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:20,644
Scott: Right.

684
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:22,160
Scott: And that girl is like she wants horses.

685
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:26,340
Scott: And the other one is like cows are all about cows winning blue ribbons.

686
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:26,944
Rym: Oh, my God.

687
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:28,280
Scott: Those guys who were in the Holstein Club.

688
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:29,229
Rym: The Holstein Club.

689
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:29,754
Rym: Yeah.

690
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:30,360
Rym: The best.

691
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:33,960
Scott: And then you got, you know, all kinds of different.

692
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:34,222
Scott: Right.

693
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:36,120
Scott: Everything you could possibly think of on a farm.

694
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:36,926
Scott: Right.

695
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:37,920
Scott: There's someone there.

696
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,120
Scott: It's like they all know what they want to do with their lives already.

697
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:43,379
Scott: You know, and this guy shows up and he's like, oh, my God.

698
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:46,120
Scott: Eggs come from a chicken, but it's Gabriel.

699
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,427
Rym: But it's like it's a cloaca.

700
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:49,239
Rym: He's like, no, it's an anus, anus, anus.

701
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,723
Scott: They can't even eat an egg.

702
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:55,360
Rym: Now that he's seen this is a great scene where he's sitting there in the cafeteria and ever seen these eggs.

703
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,240
Rym: And he keeps picturing it coming out of the chicken.

704
00:32:57,682 --> 00:32:58,752
Rym: And he just like can't eat it.

705
00:32:58,772 --> 00:32:59,619
Rym: He's freaking out.

706
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:06,236
Rym: And he just keeps thinking in his head, anus, anus, anus, Charles, anus, Charles, can't eat.

707
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,660
Scott: the egg came out of a butt.

708
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:12,980
Scott: I mean, the show starts out, we clean the egg, dude, and that is a shell to the show.

709
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:22,020
Rym: Pretty much immediately gets into that very kind of important point about farming that farmers and food involves killing.

710
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:22,561
Scott: Yeah.

711
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:28,880
Scott: I mean, even to go see a vet at like the horse race track and it's like, you know, one guy, he's like, I want to be a vet.

712
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:32,200
Scott: So he asked the you know, he's like, hey, well, what does it take to be a vet?

713
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,019
Scott: He's like, got to be able to kill animals.

714
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:36,659
Scott: If you can't deal with killing animals, can't be a vet.

715
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:37,282
Rym: Yep.

716
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:43,180
Rym: Or right away, like they help a bunch of upperclassmen get some chickens that were loose and then the guy's like, oh, thanks.

717
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,339
Rym: Then immediately starts killing them right in front of him.

718
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:47,159
Rym: And then says, oh, I'll give you some of the chicken later.

719
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,900
Scott: He gives them some of the chicken later.

720
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,140
Scott: And he just imagines, he remembers that chicken's head being cut off.

721
00:33:52,340 --> 00:34:04,640
Rym: So the show really, really kind of elegantly handles the whole dichotomy of a farmer on one hand, caring very much for the welfare of their animals, while simultaneously recognizing that those animals are to be killed and eaten.

722
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:05,819
Scott: Yeah, he named a pig.

723
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,223
Scott: I'm waiting.

724
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:07,600
Scott: He named the pig Pork Bowl.

725
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,699
Rym: Episode nine appears to be when that gets resolved.

726
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,820
Scott: He's going to become bacon.

727
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,340
Rym: Episode nine, Hachi Kitten hesitates and it's a picture of him and Pork Bowl.

728
00:34:17,965 --> 00:34:18,719
Scott: Pork Bowl is done.

729
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,199
Rym: Pork Bowl is going to become Bacon Bowl.

730
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,878
Scott: Pork Bowl is definitely going to become Bacon Bowl.

731
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,257
Scott: One hundred percent.

732
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:33,179
Rym: Like the opener has this really poignant moment where you see him sitting down and there's a spread of food in front of him, all this beef and eggs and meat.

733
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:40,280
Rym: And then behind him, walking up are the ghosts of all these baby pigs and baby cows and baby chickens.

734
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:43,100
Rym: And then he eats the meat and he's really conflicted.

735
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,839
Rym: And then the fat girl steals it.

736
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:47,280
Scott: The fat girl is actually pretty cool.

737
00:34:47,442 --> 00:34:47,898
Scott: I like her.

738
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:52,580
Scott: Yeah, it's like you see a character like that and it's like, oh, they're going to be making like fat jokes and shit.

739
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:55,620
Rym: I knew a girl who looked almost exactly like that when I was in high school.

740
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,340
Scott: But it's like she's actually crazy awesome.

741
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,100
Scott: She's smart.

742
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,860
Scott: She's not, you know, she doesn't have a good personality.

743
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,958
Scott: She works hard.

744
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:06,520
Scott: You know, she doesn't, you know, she's she just looks that way.

745
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,620
Scott: I like when they meet her brother and he's super tall and they're both in the ping pong club and are crazy awesome at ping pong.

746
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,005
Scott: Yeah.

747
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:12,480
Scott: Right.

748
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,480
Scott: And it's like, all right.

749
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:19,180
Scott: They didn't make this fat character like, you know, the annoying character that you see in a lot of other shows.

750
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,380
Scott: There actually is no bad character or annoying character.

751
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,139
Scott: Like everyone is a good guy in the whole show.

752
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:26,260
Rym: But everyone's got some deal going on.

753
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,419
Rym: And the character designs are all over the place, which I actually really like.

754
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:35,680
Rym: Like every character is extremely unique to the point that I recognize.

755
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,220
Scott: I love Buddha horse racing cheese.

756
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:37,943
Rym: Oh, my God.

757
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:42,440
Rym: The teacher who looks like Buddha, who hides cheese on campus.

758
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,660
Scott: He's not just hiding cheese.

759
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,880
Scott: He's hiding an entire cheese cellar.

760
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,520
Rym: Never mind the whole cheese cellar.

761
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,677
Rym: You know how many wheels are down there?

762
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,799
Rym: That he is that he is a straight up gambling addict.

763
00:35:54,624 --> 00:35:55,427
Rym: Right.

764
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:58,800
Scott: But at the same time, when he's out with the horse club, he's so Buddha like.

765
00:35:59,121 --> 00:35:59,351
Scott: Right.

766
00:35:59,923 --> 00:36:00,105
Rym: Yeah.

767
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,660
Scott: But it's just like he's multiple.

768
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,280
Scott: You just keep using the same character in different situations.

769
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:04,802
Scott: Like, all right.

770
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:08,180
Scott: He's a cheese hoarder and a gambling addict and a Buddha and a horse.

771
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,520
Scott: And he's so calm and takes care of the horse.

772
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,438
Scott: He's all nicely.

773
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,160
Rym: But at the same time, he he has aspects of the Buddha.

774
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,760
Rym: Or he'll say there's one moment where the characters want something from him.

775
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,817
Rym: He's like, no, I won't give it to you.

776
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:22,939
Rym: But the way he says that is something like the root of all human intuition and whatever is greed.

777
00:36:24,103 --> 00:36:25,317
Rym: And they're like, you're just being stingy.

778
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:27,799
Scott: Yeah, you're greed gives the cheese.

779
00:36:31,683 --> 00:36:35,860
Rym: But yeah, the show is just really fun, really well put together.

780
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,800
Scott: The characters are all just makes you feel good to feel good show.

781
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,420
Rym: Every time I thought, oh, the show is going to get boring.

782
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,360
Rym: It would just immediately skip to something new.

783
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,720
Rym: Like it keeps staying fresh and introducing new elements and new characters and new plots and new twists.

784
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,980
Scott: So that's the thing I think is almost the show's problem.

785
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:51,422
Scott: Right.

786
00:36:51,522 --> 00:36:56,140
Scott: Is that the conflicts and are all resolved so quickly.

787
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,766
Scott: It's like this guy gets to the.

788
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:01,540
Scott: you know, you think the show's going to be about him learning to deal with the farm.

789
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,420
Scott: He learns to deal with it right away.

790
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,740
Scott: He's like like, you know, after the chicken thing, he's like, nope, don't make assumptions.

791
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:08,445
Scott: And he doesn't.

792
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:10,438
Rym: He basically but he doesn't deal with it 100 percent.

793
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:11,868
Rym: He still has issues.

794
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:13,260
Scott: He still hesitates a little bit.

795
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,280
Scott: But he's like, no, like he knows consciously, like I have learned my farm lesson.

796
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:18,947
Scott: I'm doing this.

797
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:20,240
Scott: And he just does it every time.

798
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:26,100
Rym: Like I was so worried that Haji Ken was going to have this long running gag where he would like flip out every time a farm thing.

799
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:26,708
Rym: Happened.

800
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:27,479
Rym: And it'd be a big deal.

801
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,020
Scott: I know he gets so he learns his lesson once and then he learns his lesson mostly.

802
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:31,642
Rym: Right.

803
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:34,860
Scott: And that's refreshing that someone learned their lesson so quickly.

804
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:40,280
Scott: But it also basically removes a whole conflict from the show because it got resolved so early.

805
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,440
Rym: It's like in Fushigi Yugi, you really want Miyaka and Taka and Tomohome to be together.

806
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,764
Rym: You really want that to happen.

807
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:50,280
Rym: And as soon as they're together, the next episode, you really wish one of them would die.

808
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,248
Scott: You're right.

809
00:37:51,633 --> 00:37:52,060
Scott: Exactly.

810
00:37:53,143 --> 00:37:54,255
Scott: It's like, oh, they got together.

811
00:37:54,276 --> 00:37:54,599
Scott: Now what?

812
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:59,920
Rym: But he has a sort of more existential crisis, as Scott was alluding to, around the fact that he doesn't know why he's there.

813
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,709
Rym: He doesn't want to be there.

814
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:01,540
Rym: He doesn't get the farm.

815
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,362
Scott: Yeah.

816
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:04,060
Scott: It's like he's really good at everything, though.

817
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,460
Scott: So but there still is a question of what is he going to do?

818
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,319
Rym: I like how he looks down on the other kids at first because they're really dumb at things like math.

819
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,800
Scott: He's the number one smartest kid in the school.

820
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,500
Rym: I really well, in the beginning, it looked like they were setting him up to be really good at academics, but fail all the farm stuff.

821
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,540
Rym: But now he's top student in everything.

822
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:25,337
Scott: He's just the best.

823
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,700
Rym: But like Keiji, that kid who's like, you got to tutor me in math.

824
00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:32,099
Rym: And he's like, this is middle school stuff, dude.

825
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:35,780
Rym: And he's like, and Keiji says, never underestimate my stupidity.

826
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:36,858
Scott: That's a good line.

827
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,260
Rym: And then he's like, all right, fine, I'll start teaching you.

828
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,588
Rym: So this is X and that's Y. He's like, X?

829
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:54,760
Scott: But other than the mystery of why does he hate his parents and want to get away, which is clearly something to do with, you know, the whole Japanese, you know, pressure to do well, whatever.

830
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,401
Scott: Right.

831
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:59,280
Scott: He probably just worked crazy hard studying and didn't have a life in middle school or whatever.

832
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,800
Rym: Yeah, he was going to that cram school.

833
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,560
Scott: You know, other than that, right.

834
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,504
Scott: Mystery of what actually happened.

835
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:11,680
Scott: that brought him to the farm school, which is already mostly revealed, not completely revealed, but mostly revealed.

836
00:39:12,342 --> 00:39:16,040
Scott: It's like, I guess is, is he going to get together with the girl?

837
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:23,780
Rym: But his finding of some sort of purpose, the yeah, the 26 episodes of Initial D are still going to be four episodes.

838
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,499
Scott: He's learned he likes this stuff and he's learned he can be good at whatever he wants to be good at.

839
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:29,660
Scott: And at the end of episode four.

840
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,139
Scott: What is he actually going to do?

841
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,919
Scott: Like, what is his area of expertise going to be?

842
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,360
Rym: So I wonder if, because it's interesting, I've never had this happen before.

843
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:43,218
Rym: We decided to watch four episodes for the review because that's the classic RIT anime sprint.

844
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,439
Scott: Felt like it could have been the last episode of the show.

845
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:47,920
Rym: If that had been the whole show, that would have been a great show.

846
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:50,920
Scott: You could have just pretended that was episode four.

847
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,579
Scott: It was the last episode and not watched any more of it.

848
00:39:53,721 --> 00:39:55,038
Scott: And you would have believed it was the end.

849
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,498
Rym: Though you would also have learned that Japanese people have a really fucked up sense of what a pizza is.

850
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:03,680
Rym: He's like, I'm going to make a pizza.

851
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:04,799
Rym: Oh, but I need bacon.

852
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:05,318
Rym: It's like, what?

853
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:06,792
Scott: Why not?

854
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:08,079
Rym: Yeah, why not?

855
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:08,356
Rym: Indeed.

856
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:14,780
Rym: But the fact that you don't think I'm going to make a pizza, semi-colon, I need bacon.

857
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:16,779
Rym: That's not the first thing you think.

858
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,580
Rym: Bacon is one of those more esoteric ingredients on a pizza.

859
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:22,060
Rym: It's not the first thing.

860
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,340
Scott: You do when your pet's name is Porpo.

861
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:28,119
Rym: That pizza did look really good, though.

862
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:29,439
Scott: Yeah, I'd eat that.

863
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,500
Rym: It was like that thick bacon and asparagus and tomato sauce and that cheese they stole.

864
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:35,380
Rym: Well, they didn't steal it.

865
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,580
Rym: They blackmailed him to get it.

866
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,177
Scott: You know, they talked about getting flour where they had to just fuck tons of flour, right?

867
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:43,000
Scott: They did not mention where they got any yeast from.

868
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:49,820
Scott: Not to say that a farm has no yeast, but there was an ingredient there that they did not source.

869
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,580
Rym: Maybe they got natural yeast or maybe they keep cultures.

870
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,518
Scott: I'm just saying they probably do, but they didn't.

871
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,460
Scott: Every single other ingredient had a character associated with it.

872
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:04,339
Scott: Exactly, but they didn't even bother mentioning, you know, that one ingredient that was necessary for the dough.

873
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:11,740
Rym: I'm wondering it, but it's weird that so usually four episodes is enough to give you a sense of a show, but not accomplish anything significant.

874
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:18,019
Rym: Like I remember Initial D at the end of episode four, you know what the show is like, but you don't know if Takumi wins that first race.

875
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:20,498
Rym: Four episodes was our go to.

876
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,920
Scott: The fourth episode of this is basically a race that he wins in the end.

877
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:24,737
Scott: And that's the end.

878
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:31,900
Rym: So I'm wondering if the rest of the show just takes off on the farm stuff in much more detail and a bunch of like subplots and all the other characters.

879
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,620
Scott: Yeah, I hope it goes off the other characters.

880
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:37,200
Rym: I really want to see what a lot of their like one episode each resolve their deal.

881
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,000
Rym: I would like to see that Mayumi goes home to her cheese house episode.

882
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:45,379
Rym: Or Tomoko and whatever her like ping pong life is like.

883
00:41:48,750 --> 00:42:00,269
Scott: But yeah, if you need a feel good anime to watch after you watch Kill la Kill because that's only 20 minutes long and you already watched the episode of Kill la Kill twice, then you can watch this.

884
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,070
Rym: Oh my God.

885
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,689
Rym: I watched the first episode of Kill la Kill again the other day.

886
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,370
Scott: God damn, I am hard pressed.

887
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:10,965
Scott: My favorite episode is still the one where they get a uniform or didn't have one.

888
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,290
Scott: They keep getting better apartments and better apartments and better apartments.

889
00:42:16,356 --> 00:42:17,409
Rym: That was a pretty good episode.

890
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,550
Rym: Kill la Kill is just, we'll talk about it again once it's done.

891
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,730
Rym: There's no point in even saying anything other than that.

892
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,229
Rym: It's everything we expected it to be and more.

893
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:34,150
Rym: Just that first episode when the kids are running down the stairs and you see Gomigori just falling in the window.

894
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:45,750
Rym: So if you're not watching Kill la Kill or you just need more anime to watch and you one of the better shows that's ongoing right now that we know that we've seen.

895
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:47,750
Rym: I've got, I've scrolled through country girl.

896
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:57,670
Rym: There's maybe five other shows I would consider possibly having potential that are ongoing right now that maybe we'll have to watch four episodes of and review.

897
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:01,790
Rym: I think I will watch the rest of Silver Spoon.

898
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,570
Rym: I might if I have time, but I'm going to not binge on it.

899
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,530
Rym: I'm going to watch it sporadically until Kill la Kill ends.

900
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:15,170
Rym: If I haven't finished Silver Spoon and Kill la Kill ends, then I'm going to watch Ghost in the Shell and then once that's done, I'm waiting to see.

901
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:15,689
Scott: That's the thing.

902
00:43:15,811 --> 00:43:17,009
Scott: There's a bunch of anime right now.

903
00:43:17,432 --> 00:43:19,510
Scott: I'm not watching because I'm waiting like Gundam Unicorn.

904
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,129
Scott: The last episodes coming like early next year.

905
00:43:22,752 --> 00:43:25,922
Scott: As soon as that comes out, I'm going to watch all the Gundam Unicorns and Ghost in the Shell Arise.

906
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,088
Scott: As soon as the last one comes out, going to watch all of them.

907
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,190
Scott: Evangelion, you know, something you will not not 99.

908
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,941
Rym: You will not watch movies, whatever.

909
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,910
Rym: I'm going to watch all those when all of them are out, right?

910
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,190
Scott: So it's like there's a whole ton of animes that are really good.

911
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:42,810
Rym: Meanwhile, I watch Adventure Time.

912
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,909
Rym: If Adventure Time comes out, I pretty much watch it that day.

913
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:46,930
Scott: Oh, I don't.

914
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,650
Scott: I guess this might be a couple of Adventure Times.

915
00:43:48,931 --> 00:43:50,530
Rym: No, there hasn't been another episode.

916
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,090
Rym: In fact, the last time I checked, there was no date for the next episode.

917
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,150
Scott: What's the newest episode?

918
00:43:54,773 --> 00:43:55,589
Rym: It's still Root Beer Guy.

919
00:43:56,193 --> 00:43:56,950
Scott: I haven't seen that one.

920
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,310
Scott: There you go.

921
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:58,448
Rym: Oh, you should watch that one.

922
00:43:59,572 --> 00:44:01,167
Rym: So you saw James.

923
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,230
Rym: Yes, the one after James.

924
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:03,950
Rym: It's just Root Beer Guy.

925
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,949
Rym: Just a guy going about his life.

926
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:06,570
Scott: All right.

927
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,888
Rym: Reminds me of Davey a little bit.

928
00:44:08,214 --> 00:44:08,429
Scott: Okay.

929
00:44:09,391 --> 00:44:09,987
Rym: He's Root Beer Guy.

930
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:10,750
Scott: Okay.

931
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,490
Rym: But I don't think... They haven't announced more episodes.

932
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:18,690
Rym: Though I did watch the semi-episode that is in the cutscenes of the Adventure Time dungeon game.

933
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:19,247
Scott: Was it good?

934
00:44:21,213 --> 00:44:22,950
Rym: It revealed information.

935
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:23,630
Rym: Okay.

936
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:25,309
Rym: There was only one good thing.

937
00:44:25,991 --> 00:44:28,630
Rym: I'm going to spoil it because that game is so shit.

938
00:44:28,772 --> 00:44:28,858
Scott: Good.

939
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,150
Rym: So you can watch the cutscene.

940
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,910
Rym: There's almost no content in these cutscenes.

941
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:34,222
Scott: Okay.

942
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:37,830
Rym: The big monster at the end is Pingu and it explodes everywhere.

943
00:44:38,338 --> 00:44:39,110
Rym: And it gets all over...

944
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:41,430
Scott: Is it Princess Bubblegum?

945
00:44:42,353 --> 00:44:43,830
Rym: It's her parents, basically.

946
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:44,269
Scott: Okay.

947
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,989
Rym: It gets all over LSP, but it doesn't get all over anyone else.

948
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:56,190
Rym: So there's this heartfelt moment in the foreground where Princess Bubblegum and Finn and everyone are kind of explaining what happened and kind of talking it out.

949
00:44:56,531 --> 00:45:00,410
Rym: And in the background, LSP is just getting increasingly visibly angry.

950
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:03,110
Rym: How come it got all over me and not all over everybody else?

951
00:45:03,354 --> 00:45:04,190
Rym: This is so gross.

952
00:45:04,431 --> 00:45:09,689
Rym: Oh, and she's getting madder and madder and madder at how dirty she is and how no one else was affected.

953
00:45:10,492 --> 00:45:13,110
Rym: And that was the funniest thing in that entire fucking game.

954
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:13,684
Scott: Okay.

955
00:45:15,173 --> 00:45:15,388
Rym: All right.

956
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:15,530
Rym: Yeah.

957
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,169
Rym: Watch Silver Spoon if you're not watching all those other things we talked about.

958
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:23,806
Rym: Might be one or two more episodes of GeekNights until next year, but don't hold your horses.

959
00:45:24,743 --> 00:45:25,728
Rym: We're... Don't hold your breath.

960
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:26,970
Rym: Don't count your horses.

961
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,848
Scott: You're lucky you got this one.

962
00:45:28,731 --> 00:45:31,009
Rym: It's busy times for Rym and Scott right now.

963
00:45:37,755 --> 00:45:39,890
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

964
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:45,009
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

965
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:50,430
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

966
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:53,350
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

967
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:58,110
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

969
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:05,910
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

970
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:09,050
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
