1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,529
Rym: It's Tuesday August 20th 2013.

2
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:18,205
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight to board games village and Innovation.

3
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,600
Rym: we didn't like either of them that much.

4
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:22,902
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:27,148
Rym: I guess spoilers.

6
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:28,954
Rym: so up.

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:48,095
Rym: the other day Emily and I ordered some Indian food and the Indian food delivery man who himself appeared Indian arrived and handed us the food and Said two words that I've never had a delivery man Tell me before that were in the context of food being delivered unnerving Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:49,665
Rym: Can you guess what those two words were?

9
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:51,887
Scott: It's poison Good luck.

10
00:00:52,990 --> 00:01:01,781
Rym: Yeah We looked at the food like And then we ate it anyway because we were really hungry.

11
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,389
Scott: Yeah, that's how it's gonna be.

12
00:01:04,072 --> 00:01:08,208
Rym: Though we've been sadly busy lately one of our rabbits the little brown one Mookie has been sick.

13
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:14,265
Rym: So we've been Jamming food down his mouth with the syringe and forcing him to eat greens.

14
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:15,530
Scott: How do you even notice he was sick?

15
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:17,229
Rym: Uh, you know, it's funny.

16
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,525
Rym: Everyone I have told this to has asked that first question.

17
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:22,690
Rym: How do you tell if a rabbit is?

18
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,850
Scott: Yeah, I imagine if you're taking care of it Like you need to be a fucking attention to detail right to even notice this kind of stuff.

19
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,605
Rym: So a dog or a cat or other animals like that.

20
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:35,120
Rym: if they're sick They they tell you they like vomit everywhere exactly.

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,166
Rym: They they're like, ah like a dog.

22
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:41,277
Rym: I should come up and be like, I'm hurt like a baby human.

23
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:46,820
Rym: so that's because they're predators and omnivores and animals that are traditionally prey.

24
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:55,910
Rym: animals tend to Evolutionarily not display illness so they will look perfectly fine and then suddenly die.

25
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,724
Rym: Because think if an animal like if a rabbit in the wild looks sick Foxes are like, oh hells.

26
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:04,218
Rym: Yeah I'm just gonna walk over and bite right?

27
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,425
Scott: Otherwise, I'm too tired to chase a rabbit right now.

28
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,009
Scott: Yeah, I'm not hungry yet.

29
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:08,392
Scott: So

30
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:20,137
Rym: if you own a rabbit and you pay attention to animals It's pretty obvious when they're sick But you have to know like they sit a certain way and they don't have a high enough fecal output and they're not eating as Much of their food or they stop eating.

31
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:24,237
Scott: and I think you would notice like if one rabbit you went to clean the poop It's like huh?

32
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,509
Scott: The other rabbit didn't poop.

33
00:02:26,152 --> 00:02:28,261
Rym: But somebody who doesn't know rabbits might think huh?

34
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:35,243
Rym: Well, I'll wait cuz you know, I don't poop every day Sometimes Yeah, but sometimes I just don't poop.

35
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:36,630
Rym: Sometimes the dog just doesn't poop.

36
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:37,809
Scott: I mean you had to be cut it down there?

37
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,788
Rym: No, no, but a dog getting constipated is only a medical emergency if it goes on for a while.

38
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:44,664
Scott: That's true Same with the human.

39
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:53,170
Rym: Yeah There's just a story on FARC about a guy who basically couldn't eat food and was having some sort of gastrointestinal distress.

40
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:54,856
Scott: I don't know.

41
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:56,100
Rym: the article wasn't into those.

42
00:02:56,321 --> 00:03:01,750
Rym: He didn't go to the doctor until the third day Because he didn't want a colonoscopy.

43
00:03:02,631 --> 00:03:04,178
Rym: Okay, he's really afraid of that.

44
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:05,223
Rym: So he almost died.

45
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:08,598
Scott: a lot of people that you know Get sick or whatever because they're afraid of the doctor.

46
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:11,370
Rym: I know I'm a not afraid of the doctor.

47
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,505
Rym: I'm pretty the dentist not really.

48
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:18,778
Rym: but That is just way sadder than go to the doctor because the doctor will be like, yeah I'm gonna check your blood do the whatever.

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,579
Rym: but the dentist is always like you should floss more Every day.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:32,090
Rym: but black dynamite Anyway, so yeah, we're taking care of the rabbit and it's been a lot of work because rabbits do not like to be force-fed.

51
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,278
Scott: You know, it's good not having any pets.

52
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,446
Rym: You know, what's good having pets?

53
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:37,269
Scott: not having pets.

54
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:41,285
Scott: Imagine having a baby not having one of those either.

55
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,389
Scott: Oh, I'll take the pet.

56
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:45,238
Scott: You know all the pets no babies.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,590
Rym: So yeah, we're mostly doing GeekNights again.

58
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,027
Rym: But of course we got packs coming up like right the fuck.

59
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:59,839
Scott: now We were just out of packs, but yet two weeks from to now The packs not our packs the packs.

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,300
Rym: Yep.

61
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:03,990
Scott: It's like packs of four-day packs.

62
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:06,509
Rym: It's like yeah, there's not those or trace.

63
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:09,760
Rym: Quattro Dios, there's North Africa.

64
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:12,650
Rym: There's you know Ravensburg or whatever.

65
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,743
Rym: There's all these other towns Ravenna, I guess but then there's Rome.

66
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:17,926
Rym: That's right.

67
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:18,970
Rym: That's what Pax is.

68
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,397
Scott: What this is.

69
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:21,503
Rym: that's what we're doing.

70
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:27,870
Rym: four days of this bullshit Which means after the next round of GeekNights disruptions?

71
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,590
Rym: We will probably be fairly undisrupted until magfest until holidays.

72
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:33,676
Rym: Yeah holidays and met.

73
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:34,862
Rym: what magfest is a holiday?

74
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:39,379
Scott: it sure is Ring in the new year with alcohol.

75
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,081
Scott: Everyone does that.

76
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:46,020
Rym: I believe you mean who are in the new year Like as it's New Year's it's like 2014.

77
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:53,270
Rym: Oh, I think that's what we're gonna do New Year's party because the entire New Year's party is just going from New Year's to magfest.

78
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,175
Scott: How could you not?

79
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:56,146
Scott: but what everyone's New Year's is?

80
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:56,629
Rym: I know I?

81
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,809
Rym: Assume that everyone else leaves the exact same lifestyle that I do.

82
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,307
Scott: Otherwise, how are you if you're listening to this seriously, and that's not your New Year's?

83
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:03,950
Scott: what the fuck?

84
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:04,592
Rym: I don't know.

85
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:06,666
Rym: We have a lot of listeners who play mobas.

86
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:10,056
Rym: so So I've been playing a game.

87
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:20,498
Rym: a lot of our friends play it a lot of you play it and a lot of people For many years have tried to tell me so there's no more advanced wars games But Rym you should play some fire emblem.

88
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:20,639
Rym: you.

89
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:21,422
Rym: they're almost the same.

90
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:24,433
Rym: It is a turn-based Strategy game.

91
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:24,935
Scott: yeah now.

92
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:25,999
Scott: We're like square grid.

93
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:26,942
Scott: Just like advanced wars.

94
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:31,230
Rym: I used to say yeah, whatever I played crystal warriors on the game gear.

95
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:35,088
Rym: I don't need to play another game like that and well would say play on a fantasy tactics.

96
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,516
Scott: advance Yeah, but you eat.

97
00:05:36,557 --> 00:05:37,523
Scott: despite your complaints.

98
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:38,449
Scott: You did play it a lot.

99
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:43,427
Rym: I played it a lot in that I played it until I beat it to make sure I wasn't missing anything right.

100
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:47,670
Scott: well final fan Fire emblem is much similar more similar to fun fancy tactics.

101
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:52,630
Scott: It is that it is to advance wars, but basically I they're not even in the same category.

102
00:05:52,871 --> 00:06:01,116
Rym: Nope fire emblem is literally just crystal warriors on the game gear which came out pretty Contemporarily to the original fire.

103
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:02,881
Scott: remember yeah fire emblems pretty old right.

104
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:06,010
Rym: yeah like crystal warriors was basically a fire emblem clone.

105
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,656
Rym: They came in Japan.

106
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:11,790
Scott: they were directly competing the same way that Duke Nukem 3d and quake were competing.

107
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:14,825
Rym: They appear in fact to have been doing just that.

108
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:22,096
Rym: maybe you should research that shit But it I did and I've been researching it more because I want to talk about crystal warriors But if answer is pretty it's both those.

109
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:28,037
Rym: the problem is when I say oh, that's just crystal warriors people don't say nah They say what's crystal warriors right?

110
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:29,301
Rym: Oh a game on the game gear.

111
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,264
Rym: What's the game gear?

112
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:31,428
Rym: game put out by Sega?

113
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:32,070
Rym: What's Sega?

114
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:42,957
Rym: But I played fire emblem awakening because it's the newest one and Complex game.

115
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,229
Rym: no it is not a difficult game.

116
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:49,226
Rym: It is in fact a very easy and very grindy game.

117
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:50,250
Scott: Did you play it on hard?

118
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,049
Rym: I played it on normal difficulty classic mode

119
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:54,633
Scott: Mm-hmm

120
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:59,857
Rym: because the higher difficulty I tried it is basically Memorize and grind

121
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:00,459
Scott: mmm

122
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:12,579
Rym: and worry a lot about your classes and bullshit But not in a tactical sense it just in a make sure you level up your characters through this exact Progression to make them optimally strong in these particular ways.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,895
Rym: oh and memorize when different monsters appear in different parts of these different maps Mm-hmm.

124
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,017
Scott: that's the one thing that always got me I played.

125
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:24,164
Scott: I never beat a fire emblem But I think I played a GBA one maybe one or two GBA ones and the ds1.

126
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:28,258
Scott: I didn't play the 3ds1 at all I don't even buy it and the experience.

127
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:31,449
Scott: I had with all of them was pretty much the same like fun fun fun fun fun.

128
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:34,950
Scott: Okay, there's not a lot going on here tactically, but it's kind of fun.

129
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,239
Scott: And I'm playing and I'm seeing.

130
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:45,760
Scott: I don't really care about the story too much But I like doing these missions kinda right, and I'm not really gonna pay too much attention all the ancillary bullshit Just gonna beat the missions and forget all the other nonsense.

131
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:47,650
Rym: I paid a lot of attention to the dating part.

132
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:49,278
Scott: Well, I didn't pay attention to that at all.

133
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,372
Scott: that part is the best part of the game That's the part I ignored the most Except.

134
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:59,554
Scott: and then what would happen is eventually I'd be on some mission and basically my strategy was always the same wait wait Let me guess let me guess.

135
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,207
Rym: one of your winged units gets killed out of nowhere, and you start over.

136
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:08,070
Scott: Yeah Basically I would group all the people together in a blob so that they were protecting each other.

137
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,649
Scott: I would always do the rock-paper-scissors of axe spear sword right.

138
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:17,450
Scott: yeah I would kill all the bad guys in one hit you know and I just keep moving forward very slowly and safely.

139
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,130
Scott: I would heal guys that were damaged.

140
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:26,174
Scott: I would cast magic spells the guys are against weak against magic right and then I'd move forward like no bad guys would attack Me for a couple turns.

141
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:39,597
Scott: so I'd move forward a bit and then out of nowhere a bad guy would appear from the fog of Come zooming across the map with a greater distance than I thought was possible for any unit be right next to a unit He's super strong against and kill it in one shy

142
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:39,678
Rym: yep,

143
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,163
Scott: and it's like well.

144
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,110
Scott: What could the fuck have I done about that?

145
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,178
Scott: nothing Restart and not me.

146
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:48,022
Scott: in next time.

147
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:51,761
Scott: make sure that winging unit is Not near that place.

148
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,070
Scott: that guy's gonna appear out of nowhere.

149
00:08:53,391 --> 00:09:03,228
Scott: So and that bit when I got to those missions where that bullshit would happen it Became less fun because I wouldn't just beat the mission in one shot like I did in all the previous missions it would actually.

150
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:09,790
Scott: Suddenly I was spending as much time to beat that one mission as it took me to like just fly through three other missions.

151
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:18,052
Scott: so the fun disappeared of just Blasting through the game really quickly beating everything and I was like well fuck this and I put it down and then the ds1 same Thing.

152
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:32,066
Rym: so so I want to basically talk about about the highlights the overview the pieces of the game that frustrate me or had issues because the Reason the game is the way it is is Kind of due to the way the combat is designed.

153
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:36,210
Rym: one Tactically the game is completely mindless.

154
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:43,030
Rym: The rock-paper-scissors is obvious to the rock-paper-scissors doesn't even fucking matter for you.

155
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,410
Rym: It only matters when you get attacked because your guys look pretty much one shot everyone.

156
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:56,155
Rym: If you've grinded a whole bun If you just play the game and don't level up any other Characters than a core set.

157
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:58,722
Rym: Oh, yeah, you're gonna be super fucking high-leveling.

158
00:09:58,742 --> 00:09:59,143
Rym: Guess what?

159
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:01,309
Rym: There's no reason to level up anyone else.

160
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:05,430
Scott: There is if you want to do all the dating shit and whatnot.

161
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:13,510
Rym: Ah, yes So - the dating shit seemed really interesting until it turned out that it's not actually that interesting.

162
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:14,227
Scott: So I never did it.

163
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:19,388
Scott: So I did it because I'll be making my tactical decisions on the battlefield about who's gonna live and die based on.

164
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:21,176
Scott: I need these People to stand next to each other what?

165
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:30,001
Rym: no I need you to stand far away from that unit who's strong against you Because you get him next to each other and they level up to their s-rank or whatever And then when they're next to each other, they're basically invincible.

166
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:30,904
Scott: I didn't know that.

167
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:32,430
Rym: Uh, yeah, they support each other.

168
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,390
Scott: Maybe I had that that was dying all the time stayed next to someone.

169
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,864
Rym: Yes, so my Pegasus unit is.

170
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:41,090
Scott: why is it always the Pegasus?

171
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:46,626
Rym: Actually, what's far more vulnerable is the rabbit girl because she's a beast.

172
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:47,630
Scott: I don't have a rabbit girl.

173
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:50,559
Rym: She's all well in Fire Emblem awakening.

174
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:51,041
Rym: I have her.

175
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,049
Rym: she's also a dragon rider.

176
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,122
Rym: now She's got that dragon type on her and she's a flying type.

177
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:57,950
Rym: So she's weak against fucking everything.

178
00:11:00,112 --> 00:11:08,285
Rym: But uh, I have a. I have my Pegasus person Married to a guy who can basically protect her one of the super guys on a horse.

179
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:13,170
Scott: anyone on a horse is basically invincible Excepts to the anti horse weapons, right?

180
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:13,872
Scott: But it's pretty much.

181
00:11:13,912 --> 00:11:18,590
Scott: horses are pretty much like, you know, medium tanks and neo tanks in Fire Emblem, right?

182
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:22,970
Scott: The night especially and they always at the beginning they always give you a guy and a horse with armor.

183
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,577
Scott: That's just better than the other horses.

184
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:27,370
Scott: Yeah, it's like that guy is even better than your main guy.

185
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:28,869
Scott: He's like the guy of guys.

186
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:35,188
Rym: But anyway, my point is that technically there's nothing going on other than oh fuck you didn't pay attention to something.

187
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:40,630
Rym: start over Yeah, which is very similar to the s-rank mode in the original GBA advanced wars.

188
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,510
Rym: Yep, so that was actually kind of an annoying and bad part about that old advanced wars game.

189
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,878
Rym: But I digress to.

190
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:50,964
Rym: the combat is meaningless primarily because level matters.

191
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:54,560
Rym: but more importantly Units do not have zones of control.

192
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,082
Rym: Mm-hmm.

193
00:11:55,363 --> 00:12:02,750
Rym: You cannot have Interesting tactics because units can just walk right fucking past other units and around and everywhere.

194
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:15,790
Rym: Yeah And the maps are so small and the terrain is so meaningless and the units moved so far That nothing you might be thinking Oh, I'll take my wyvern riders and send them down to the south and around into a flanking mover.

195
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:19,490
Rym: No, just make a big fucking grid blob and slowly move it forward.

196
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,910
Scott: Well, you know the healers are in the middle of the blobs And I think you can get next to them or turn your healers into axe healers.

197
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,638
Rym: Then they can fight with axes and heal and are basically invincible.

198
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,490
Scott: Ah, you're the her, you know, that's like second at D&D.

199
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,760
Scott: I want to be a fighter mage.

200
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:33,930
Scott: Yep, so I can do everything.

201
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:50,242
Rym: That's why my favorite class other than blade singer in second at D&D was the arcanist Which was a kit that was basically a multi-class not dual class multi-class half-elf That is half wizard half cleric.

202
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,850
Rym: That is some fucking bullshit, right?

203
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:56,138
Scott: All right, let's move on.

204
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:03,048
Rym: so the other the other points the relationships themselves Really superficial and more importantly the flavor.

205
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:03,289
Rym: text.

206
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:10,326
Rym: It with one exception was not that interesting and it gets minus a million points for being creepy.

207
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:11,770
Rym: and pulling the Sasami paradox.

208
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:24,008
Rym: for those of you who don't watch anime Sasami is a young girl in a show called Tenchi and I had a scary motherfucking fanboy a long time ago who was trying to explain to me and other people to

209
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:24,590
Scott: the anime club

210
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:32,715
Rym: That it is okay to like this character in a sexual way because technically she's 9,000 years old.

211
00:13:35,254 --> 00:13:38,597
Rym: yeah, no and Fire Emblem awakening does that.

212
00:13:38,637 --> 00:13:43,436
Rym: there's a dragon girl who's basically a nine-year-old technically a thousand or whatever.

213
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:47,249
Rym: and yeah, she got married to my creepy noble Archer guy.

214
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:50,230
Rym: and Yeah, everything about that was creepy.

215
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:52,838
Rym: Okay, but the relationships themselves.

216
00:13:53,179 --> 00:14:06,750
Rym: the game forces you to make these decisions because you can only marry one person With each character so you can't see everything unless you grind through the game a billion times and there's a billion characters But none of them matter to the core gameplay.

217
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:12,870
Rym: You'd might as well just watch all those relationships on YouTube and level up one core set of characters.

218
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:16,250
Rym: I'm gonna keep playing the game until I beat it and then I'm gonna give it away.

219
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:22,270
Rym: I want to see if at any point the game is challenging in a non shit way.

220
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:24,701
Rym: Oh and items and all that stuff don't matter.

221
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:29,795
Rym: You can just auto optimize it and it's fine Unless you plan on normal difficulty.

222
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:34,970
Rym: and if you play it on the ludicrous difficulty, then it's just super tedious and still not interesting.

223
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,800
Rym: It's just micromanaging but not interesting.

224
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,470
Scott: Okay, so here's the news, right?

225
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:44,306
Scott: So, you know, we love the steam and people be hating on origin Which is EA trying to compete with steam and cuz?

226
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:44,890
Scott: it's kind of shitty.

227
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:49,710
Scott: Yeah, but origin whoever's at EA I think is trying to make a comeback.

228
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:59,890
Scott: They did this humble origin bundle thing where you would buy all these games in a bundle for you know Just like humble bundle price, right and the games ran an origin though.

229
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:09,893
Scott: So you have to sort of get origin and they were trying to get people into origin but to their credit all the money Just went to the charities of humble bundle and didn't go to EA Supposedly.

230
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:10,234
Scott: so.

231
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:18,694
Scott: basically EA was giving away free games on humble bundle just to get people to start using origin to try to fight Steam and not a bad move Strategically.

232
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:29,918
Scott: now they're doing another move then and this is real news They are offering ahem quote an origin great game Guarantee, I guess they did.

233
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:32,427
Scott: they did this after Sim City, right?

234
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:49,087
Scott: Yeah But basically they're saying hey look if you freakin You know download a game from origin for PC or Mac right within 24 hours after you launch the game Within 77 days of when you purchase it or within the first seven days after the game's release date.

235
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:53,750
Scott: if you pre-ordered it You can return it for a full refund the remove it from the origin account and give you your money back.

236
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:54,430
Scott: So, huh?

237
00:15:54,530 --> 00:16:09,054
Scott: Maybe the game doesn't run with your video card or it's super laggy or that is what I'm always been really bad at is Right, so it's like look they probably looked at what happened with Sony and the Xbox and the whole used game fiasco And there must.

238
00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:13,390
Scott: they must have hired a smart person somewhere who is now making a pretty good attack on steam.

239
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:26,590
Scott: This isn't gonna get me to use origin because it's still crappy compared to steam and I trust valve a lot more than EA but Hopefully this pressures steam into getting a fucking refund policy, right?

240
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,509
Scott: So when I go and download a game on steam that doesn't work I can return it or you know such-and-such.

241
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:33,154
Scott: Well, we'll see the thing.

242
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:35,300
Scott: the thing I've noticed about this though, right?

243
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:41,809
Scott: Is that I think EA is only doing it for EA games on origin, right?

244
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:48,830
Scott: So as opposed to say valve which most of the games you would run a return would not be the valve games.

245
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:50,942
Scott: Yeah, it would be the other people's games.

246
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:58,510
Scott: and as much harder, you know Valve pays someone some company right because you bought their game and then you return it and then right.

247
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:01,570
Scott: It's kind of you get into weird areas with that kind of situation.

248
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,250
Rym: Yeah, but steam could even easily cover that just by having a fairly draconian policy for the developers.

249
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:11,608
Scott: Yeah, we don't pay you and we don't give you the money from all the people who bought your game for seven days.

250
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,902
Rym: There would be ways to do that.

251
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:16,169
Rym: The thing is steam.

252
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,420
Rym: Actually, I hate to say this.

253
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:24,263
Rym: they have enough goodwill Valve does from the gaming community to where they don't need to make overtures like that.

254
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:29,330
Rym: It's also true, which is Good for them not great for gaming.

255
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:34,930
Rym: I wish there was a viable competitor for steam just to force them to do cool things that they don't have to do.

256
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:37,089
Scott: But you know what if I was making a game today?

257
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:41,749
Scott: Right, if it didn't cost me anything to put it on origin and steam why not put it on origin?

258
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,809
Rym: Unless if I were origin, I actually would not want you to put it on both.

259
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:54,830
Scott: Well, you'd have to pay me to be an exclusive and even then I probably would say no But you wouldn't want me to not have my game on origin at all if I was willing to put it there.

260
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:56,319
Scott: Yeah, right and it's like.

261
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,070
Scott: sure I'll put it there, right?

262
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,850
Scott: It's like, you know mate that will just help it compete with steam, right?

263
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,724
Scott: I would be basically not doing it to sell more copies of my game.

264
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:13,105
Scott: Although that might happen I would be doing it simply to make origin more viable to pressure steam so I could get a better deal on the steam that I cared about.

265
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:19,231
Rym: So in other PC gaming news games for Windows Live is shutting down in 2014.

266
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,418
Scott: Okay, so here's the deal.

267
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:27,687
Scott: So a few games Decided that they were gonna dump games for Windows Live and switch to Steamworks, which is awesome because it was.

268
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:28,710
Scott: Windows Live sucks.

269
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:31,342
Scott: Yeah, it's a pain in the ass and Steamworks is great.

270
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:32,729
Scott: Yeah, mostly good, right?

271
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:39,870
Scott: So then somebody noticed like on the Age of Empires 3e support page or something like that quote.

272
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:44,054
Rym: I'm looking at a screenshot of it because they took it down Almost immediately.

273
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:45,462
Scott: The Age of Empires Online.

274
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:52,186
Rym: Yes, Age of Empires Online Posted an update that said and I quote games for Windows Live will be discontinued on July 1st, 2014.

275
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:55,575
Scott: Okay, so They took this down.

276
00:18:55,815 --> 00:19:02,842
Rym: Although it is available through Steam Age of Empires Online requires the features of games for Windows Live service Mm-hmm to work.

277
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:10,210
Rym: Yep, and That update I only have a screenshot of it because they took it right the fuck down after everyone noticed it.

278
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,270
Scott: Yeah, so basically a game that uses games for Windows Live for example Borderlands, right?

279
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:26,130
Scott: You can buy a lot of these games on Steam or on DVD or on CD or download from various places And when you open the game up, basically you have to it this Windows overlay comes in.

280
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:44,246
Scott: That's sort of like the Steam overlay But it's the game Windows overlay and you log into it and you use the same account that you use for Xbox and for you Know Xbox Live right same account that you use and then you have to type in your CD key And it basically adds that game to your account and it makes sure you're not Pirating it while you run it and you have to be logged in in order to make the game run.

281
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,795
Scott: and that's how games for Windows Live works.

282
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:54,530
Scott: It's basically like an Xbox game that runs in the PC Yep Probably because of the Xbox one the X bone and all the stuff that's going on there upgrading Xbox Live.

283
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:57,190
Scott: The fact that games for Windows Live is really kind of a failure.

284
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:04,430
Scott: They are rightfully dumping it but some of the games are patching to switch to Steamworks or to switch to some other system.

285
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:16,090
Scott: But I'm sure there are games that aren't going to make that patch And games that don't make that patch won't work at all After July 1st, 2014 Without some sort of hack or DRM removal.

286
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:17,870
Scott: That's DRM guys.

287
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:26,849
Rym: Now what's interesting is that Microsoft did not want this to be public and Basically Age of Empires leaked it and the press found it.

288
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,670
Rym: Age of Empires is a Microsoft game Yes, and it appears to be a mistake and I had a little page here.

289
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,189
Rym: Actually, I realize now that I'm looking at this, Michy D wrote this.

290
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:48,272
Rym: Okay Our friend Michy D Microsoft provided a statement and Microsoft said Yesterday an Age of Empires support webpage communicated that the free-to-play Age of Empires Online will be discontinued on July 1st, 2014.

291
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:54,350
Rym: We believe in Windows/PC gaming and have long-term plans to grow our support.

292
00:20:54,833 --> 00:21:00,609
Rym: We expect there to be transitions as we build out new investments But we remain committed to bringing first blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

293
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:04,210
Scott: Basically Why do you word it in corporate speech?

294
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,087
Rym: I'm going to tell you why.

295
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,470
Scott: They just said you're turning it off.

296
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,129
Scott: Why didn't you just say, "Yeah, we're turning it off"?

297
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,329
Rym: Yes, they just said, "We're shutting it down and we're mad that you found out about it".

298
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:17,069
Scott: Because if they weren't shutting it down, they would have said Just put it in plain English.

299
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:19,269
Rym: They would have said, "Nope, we're not shutting it down".

300
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,389
Rym: So, yeah, we'll watch this.

301
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,510
Rym: But another reason why I don't trust anything but Steamworks or nothing.

302
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,730
Scott: Yeah, I mean, Steam has the same issue.

303
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,050
Scott: If Steam disappeared, say goodbye to all your games Right?

304
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,430
Rym: Yep, the only reason I trust Steam and Valve a little bit more.

305
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:35,370
Scott: Just trust the company.

306
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:37,190
Scott: It's still the same horrible DRMs.

307
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:38,029
Scott: Don't fool yourself.

308
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:43,290
Rym: I think I have a 10% chance if Valve went under of still being able to play my games.

309
00:21:43,493 --> 00:21:45,989
Scott: I think I have a Steam in perpetual offline mode.

310
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,450
Rym: I think I have a 1% chance of Windows Live stuff working.

311
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:53,350
Rym: No And a negative percent chance of EA stuff.

312
00:21:53,371 --> 00:22:02,250
Rym: Yeah Anyway, things of the day.

313
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:13,330
Rym: So, you might remember there's a best friends play games thing And there's a two best sisters play games thing Which is the audio from the best friends play thing.

314
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,729
Scott: I thought we were outlawing pony things of the day.

315
00:22:15,052 --> 00:22:17,269
Rym: You've said that several times, I never agreed to this.

316
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:20,928
Rym: Also, we haven't talked about ponies in a while because it's dead to us.

317
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,725
Rym: Anyway It is So, two best sisters play.

318
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:33,890
Rym: Persona 4 Kind of went off the hook in terms of production values And in terms of taking the piss out of Persona style games.

319
00:22:34,573 --> 00:22:44,609
Rym: So, I highly recommend if you've never played a Persona game And you want to know what the deal is To watch this video And you will know exactly why people make fun of Persona games.

320
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:47,370
Scott: Okay, so you know Imagi Animation?

321
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:55,890
Scott: They made a lot of those sort of throw away-ish CG movies Like the English, the American Astro Boy one Which was sort of generic, right?

322
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:01,710
Scott: And that TMNT that some people like And, you know, some other stuff, right?

323
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:06,310
Scott: Yeah Not really, they're not really on the same level as the Pixar's and the Dreamworks, right?

324
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:11,026
Scott: They wanted to make a Legend of Zelda movie But they didn't.

325
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:17,906
Scott: But, basically the preview sort of sample that they made in 2007 Is on YouTube.

326
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:21,210
Scott: Oh shit So you can check that shit out.

327
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:31,189
Scott: This could have been a theatrical CG Legend of Zelda movie But it wasn't, thankfully I was about to ask.

328
00:23:31,472 --> 00:23:33,210
Rym: So, Scott, should the movie have come out?

329
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,550
Rym: And I think you've answered our question.

330
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,310
Scott: You should still watch this because it's only a minute and 25 seconds of your time.

331
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:40,950
Rym: I think it's kind of like.

332
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,309
Scott: I mean, if you're a nerd, how could you not watch this?

333
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:52,150
Rym: You know, it's kind of like how when I was a kid I remembered I had this memory of seeing a Zelda cartoon That I couldn't explain.

334
00:23:52,392 --> 00:23:55,290
Rym: Excuse me, that cartoon is awful.

335
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:56,509
Rym: No, I watched that cartoon.

336
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:58,729
Rym: I'm talking about the Philips CDI games.

337
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,210
Rym: Oh I saw them in a store, I didn't realize they were a game.

338
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:06,370
Rym: And then I had these memories That no one could corroborate.

339
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,790
Rym: I could not tell if I made it up or if it was real.

340
00:24:09,911 --> 00:24:13,450
Rym: And it wasn't until many years later that I learned about the Philips CDI game.

341
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:21,248
Rym: In the meta moment, the book club book is Stazzyland Increasingly relevant as the NSA stuff continues to explode In a way that no one cares about.

342
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,850
Rym: You should probably care a little bit If GeekNights sounds a little bit weird.

343
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:30,310
Rym: Our mixer of many years has finally started to give up the ghost.

344
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:32,188
Rym: I haven't quite fixed it yet.

345
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,148
Scott: Ooh, it's floating around right now Spooky ghost.

346
00:24:35,634 --> 00:24:37,309
Rym: I'm looking into replacing it.

347
00:24:37,673 --> 00:24:38,810
Scott: Is that audition still working?

348
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:44,941
Rym: It's working fine But we're bypassing the compressor and all my business And the Marantz Recording raw and live.

349
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,470
Rym: Uh oh.

350
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,843
Rym: So yeah, a couple of clips and bits.

351
00:24:48,883 --> 00:25:02,930
Rym: as I get that sorted out Because I haven't had time to go through all the knobbly bits We're gonna be at PAX The real PAX The PAX Weekend after this coming weekend Labor Day weekend Four days Oh shit, it is on.

352
00:25:03,373 --> 00:25:04,462

353
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:11,025
Rym: on the Monday Monday in the Wolfman Theater We're doing a panel entitled Bad Games.

354
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:17,029
Scott: You know, since this is a four-day PAX There's gonna be a lot going on there besides our panel Which is a Monday panel.

355
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:18,068

00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,230
Rym: Well, this is the first Monday PAX.

Rym: I'm going to make a prediction.

365
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:42,449
Scott: I don't hate it, but I don't like it.

366
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,550
Rym: He is going to talk about how Star Wars inspired him.

367
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,028
Scott: Hopefully he'll talk about black and white To go on and make games.

368
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:55,950
Scott: Not you too, tribes two Alright, followed by the hustle Saturday I actually want to go to a panel on Saturday.

00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,310

383

Scott: Oh, really?

00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:25,908
Scott: Oh, what?

401
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,929
Scott: I can't go play Saturn Bomberman?

402
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,930
Scott: Listen guys, if you know who we are, you should go play Saturn Bomberman.

403
00:27:35,031 --> 00:27:36,510
Scott: Let the people who don't know who we are come to the panel.

404
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:42,429
Rym: Yeah, we'll video it and as many of you complained about not put the whole thing on YouTube and just put a bunch of clips up.

405
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:44,430
Scott: That's all Rym doing that.

406
00:27:44,573 --> 00:27:45,270
Rym: That is all me doing that.

407
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,188
Scott: I got nothing to do with that.

408
00:27:46,392 --> 00:27:47,510
Scott: I would just put the whole panel up.

409
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,187
Rym: It's a pain in the ass to put the whole panel up.

410
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:50,668
Scott: I didn't say it wasn't.

411
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,290
Rym: Yeah, but we're doing one other thing.

412
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,322
Rym: We're actually doing something.

413
00:27:54,363 --> 00:27:58,970
Rym: on Thursday There is an event, myself, Scott, and Emily.

414
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:07,150
Rym: You may know her from previous episodes of GeekNights and Muse Games Are going to an event that is not run by PAX or Penny Arcade.

415
00:28:07,716 --> 00:28:08,950
Rym: It's just ahead of time.

416
00:28:09,532 --> 00:28:22,548
Scott: It is basically the pre-PAX Sky High Table Tap benefits Right, so we have thought in many years Look, everyone loves to play Table Tap games before and after PAX in hotel lobbies Except for PAXOS for some reason, right?

417
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:28,190
Scott: So, but their tables there A) suck and B) are always completely jam-packed with people.

418
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:29,070
Scott: You can't get a table.

419
00:28:29,151 --> 00:28:30,690
Scott: If you could get a table, it'd be a shitty table.

420
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:34,710
Scott: Why don't we rent a hotel ballroom Thursday night or Monday?

421
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,470
Scott: Well, now Monday night, right?

422
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:44,810
Scott: Instead of Sunday morning, Monday morning And that way before and after PAX, when PAX is closed Everyone can go to those places and play games, right?

423
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,210
Scott: With comfortable tables and plenty of space.

424
00:28:47,412 --> 00:28:49,330
Scott: And that was an idea we had going around.

425
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:51,070
Scott: Let's get sponsors, let's do this.

426
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:57,130
Scott: Someone who's one step smarter than us is like "Hey, if we make it a charity event, it's actually feasible to make it happen".

427
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,169
Scott: And it's like, "Oh, duh, I wish I would have thought of that".

428
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:01,590
Scott: So these guys, what is it called?

429
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,430
Scott: What's the name of the thing?

430
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,690
Rym: Pre-PAX Sky High Table Tap Play benefiting Food Lifeline.

431
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:13,770
Scott: So, yeah, someone else did this thing And I think it's Dog Sled Events is the people who did it.

432
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,770
Rym: It's in the tallest building in Seattle Which I haven't been in And a very high floor.

433
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,690
Rym: It's kind of like the Rainbow Room.

434
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,330
Rym: It's like a private club, lounge, gaming area.

435
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,408
Scott: Right, but they rented it out.

436
00:29:23,238 --> 00:29:29,270
Scott: So we bought tickets to this And we're gonna freaking run games there and shit Whether it be tabletop RPG or board or netrunner.

437
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:34,269
Rym: We might have some announcements We might be doing some special things at it But we're gonna be there as VIPs.

438
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:40,370
Rym: The money pretty much all goes to charity And it's basically an extra day of PAX gaming in a swanky place.

439
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:42,676
Scott: Yeah, I think it's from 7 to midnight 7 to 2 AM.

440
00:29:43,996 --> 00:29:47,590
Scott: Yeah, so it's basically... PAX this year is only going to midnight, not 2 AM.

441
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:54,030
Scott: So I think, really, it's like kickoff PAX with a PAX's worth of tabletop gaming.

442
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:58,219
Rym: Yup Sign me the fuck up In a private lounge with a cash bar and only cool people And dinner.

443
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:02,889
Scott: It covers... I was gonna spend how much money on dinner, you know, that night anyway, right?

444
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,890
Scott: I was gonna be in Seattle buying dinner anyway.

445
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:11,327
Scott: So now I'm buying the dinner and getting a table And giving all that dinner money to charity.

446
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:12,769
Scott: anyway It's a great deal.

447
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:22,970
Rym: Now, if you want to go to it, buy tickets right the fuck now Because general admission, the early bird cheapie and the sort of tier 1 are sold out.

448
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,450
Scott: Oh, when I last looked the tier 1 was not sold out.

449
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:27,729
Scott: So already this thing is filling up.

450
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:33,990
Rym: Yes, so there are $45 tickets left for tier 2 Which is the same as tier 1, just more expensive.

451
00:30:34,475 --> 00:30:36,970
Rym: The money all goes to charity, so whatever It's a good charity too.

452
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:44,230
Scott: It's like a highly rated charity that gives money to like homeless people Or food to homeless people and starving people in the Seattle area.

453
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:48,190
Rym: But seriously, if you want to go to this One, me, Scott and Emily will be there.

454
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:53,470
Scott: If no one else is there, you'll play games with us Except tier 1 and tier 2 sold out, so yeah, there'll be people there.

455
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:55,289
Rym: We will hang out with you and play some games.

456
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:57,359
Rym: This is probably the only chance.

457
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,810
Rym: you'll have to see us for any length of time.

458
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,789
Scott: Well, it is a four-day pecs, you might have better chances than any other pecs.

459
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,930
Rym: Maybe, maybe, but at the same time we'll see how much we're doing, we pop around a lot.

460
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:09,390
Rym: This will be in one place for a long period of time with guaranteed tables.

461
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:13,990
Rym: True And if you're a VIP, you get a plated dinner instead of the buffet.

462
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:24,670
Scott: Whoa, snap Okay, so we've been going to packs for many years And there's always those certain games you see about And you see them constantly, but you don't play them for whatever reason.

463
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,430
Rym: Yep, like Shaggy not gonna play, Munchkin not gonna play.

464
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:29,810
Scott: Well, I've played Munchkin, but I haven't, you know Not gonna play it again.

465
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,350
Rym: I only played Shaggy once, right Not gonna play it out of packs.

466
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,190
Scott: Innovation is a game I saw constantly, I saw it everywhere.

467
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:37,010
Scott: I've seen it not just at packs, but at board game nights.

468
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:39,708
Scott: I just kept seeing the same box over and over and over again.

469
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:48,710
Scott: So Asmadi Games, who publishes that as well as We Didn't Playtest This series, right Had a super sale, buy direct from them, huge discount.

470
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:52,157
Scott: So I went to their website, just check out the sale And I bought the full.

471
00:31:52,197 --> 00:31:55,137
Scott: We Didn't Playtest This series just because it was so cheap And it included.

472
00:31:55,177 --> 00:31:58,710
Scott: We Didn't Playtest This Legacies Which is right on the cards like Risk Legacy.

473
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,430
Scott: We're gonna bust that at packs so hard.

474
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:01,129
Rym: Oh yeah, we are.

475
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:02,550
Scott: I think we should make it packs only.

476
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,710
Rym: Yes, we play it at packses, maybe packses and magfests.

477
00:32:06,172 --> 00:32:16,329
Scott: Anyway, and I bought the full set of innovation All the original and both expansions because again, so cheap And I was like, well, I've seen that game everywhere, I should play it.

478
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:23,870
Scott: So we started off with just, without even opening expansions Just playing that first box and we still haven't opened the expansions.

479
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:29,330
Rym: So we're gonna review this game, but it's more like an, I don't know, an overview.

480
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,850
Scott: Yeah, we haven't even completed one full game of innovation.

481
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:42,190
Rym: We played like a third of one game of it And, you know, we play a lot of games And it used to be a time when we would force ourselves to play every game.

482
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:54,828
Scott: Yeah, and it's like, yeah, if you want to say you guys are discussing this game And judging it having only played it a third of a session And not even finishing it once, not even seeing all the cards Perfectly accurate statement by you.

483
00:32:55,117 --> 00:32:56,247
Scott: Yes Just pin that on us.

484
00:32:56,652 --> 00:32:59,350
Rym: However, I played a lot of games in my time.

485
00:32:59,596 --> 00:33:03,970
Scott: I have And I can judge a game pretty quickly Just like I can judge a book in the first chapter.

486
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:09,450
Rym: It is rare that I have played a game where my initial impression was not the correct one.

487
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:12,990
Rym: I have played many games where I doubted my initial impression.

488
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:17,770
Rym: Like Twilight Struggle, I kept trying to play it Like there's got to be something to this.

489
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:18,830
Rym: Everyone says this game is so great.

490
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,849
Scott: Maybe we should play it again.

491
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:23,670
Rym: Yeah, every time we've said that it's ended in misery Well, maybe we should play it again.

492
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,989
Scott: It's still BoardGameGeek number one.

493
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:30,530
Rym: Yeah, because BoardGameGeek's ranking system is kind of broken Is tilted toward the grognards.

494
00:33:30,672 --> 00:33:35,710
Rym: Okay, so continue Innovation, I've no desire to ever play this game again.

495
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:37,769
Rym: I think it's kind of a bad game.

496
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:43,410
Scott: So the way it works, I don't even, you know, is There's all these cards, right?

497
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:47,070
Scott: And the cards go basically get laid out into this circle, right?

498
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,147
Scott: Of like ages, right?

499
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,790
Scott: So you're basically going through time developing more and more technologies.

500
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:54,448
Rym: Don't even try to link it to the theme Point number one.

501
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:57,964
Rym: The theme of this game means jack.

502
00:33:58,225 --> 00:34:03,729
Rym: all compared to the mechanics It might as well just be clubs and diamonds and spades Right.

503
00:34:04,272 --> 00:34:08,250
Scott: So basically you can get cards in the different colors.

504
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,789
Scott: And when you play a card, right?

505
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,530
Scott: It goes onto the top of the stack of that color, right?

506
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:16,790
Scott: And each card has these symbols visible.

507
00:34:17,454 --> 00:34:27,030
Scott: And when certain people activate abilities on cards If you have more or less symbols of the appropriate type Of the matching the ability that was activated.

508
00:34:27,553 --> 00:34:34,449
Scott: Then you can maybe team up and also do that ability Or maybe even be forced to do an ability or be the victim of an ability.

509
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:40,810
Rym: Ah, now already the game has trouble because the way that was all worded Took a couple of readings to get right.

510
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:43,878
Scott: The wording of everything is very poor And confused.

511
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:50,070
Scott: everyone at the table Seasoned gamers were confused by the wording of the rules in this game.

512
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:59,708
Rym: Now we were able to figure it out, but already it's a strike against your game If I have any question about the rules while I'm reading them Other than things that I haven't read yet Right?

513
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:04,170
Scott: The other thing about the game is you have these splays So you're piling up, say the red cards.

514
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:07,810
Scott: Every time I get a red card played it goes on top of all the other red cards.

515
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:15,710
Scott: But I could perhaps splay the red cards upwards, leftwards, rightwards, or downwards Only one direction at a time To make additional symbols appear.

516
00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:22,170
Scott: Yeah, that would reveal the symbols on the red cards beneath the currently active red card Right?

517
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:50,962
Scott: So the red card on top is gonna be the highest level, most modern one In terms of technology, right, the best But below it are many other ones And making those symbols appear on the red cards below that top one Will greatly increase the likelihood of me not being the victim of abilities Activated by other people And also being able to make other people the victim of abilities I activate And also being able to team up and take advantage of abilities other people intentionally activate Like, "Oh, you're doing something?

518
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,570
Scott: I'll get in on that.

519
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,170
Scott: Look how many symbols I have that match that.

520
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,088
Scott: Yeah, I'm doing that too".

521
00:35:54,411 --> 00:35:58,770
Rym: So, the problem with all of this is that these mechanics are not intuitive.

522
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,590
Rym: Don't analogize to anything at all in the real world or anything even close to the theme.

523
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:13,049
Rym: And they're all so varied And there's so much text of all this crazy bullshit and so many cards And so many bonuses.

524
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:16,310
Scott: And there's these bonuses that get triggered And this is the not expanded version.

525
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:17,688
Rym: There are these bonuses that get triggered.

526
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,250
Scott: We didn't open either of the two expansions.

527
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:23,370
Rym: Like, if all these conditions are true then don't forget to take the bonus card that you earned.

528
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:25,850
Scott: How can you remember all those fucking possible conditions?

529
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,269
Scott: Like, every time someone takes a turn you have to fucking check all these things To see if you got one of the bonuses.

530
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:36,088
Rym: It is literally not worth playing the game unless you have read every single card in the deck And remember them all.

531
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:39,310
Scott: Yep And, you know, it's like in most card games.

532
00:36:39,411 --> 00:36:48,730
Scott: You sort of have things that go together In board games even Things that go together Like, we played Sulken at PAXOS And it's like, "Oh, you can go the crystal skull route All these things sort of go together.

533
00:36:48,892 --> 00:36:50,630
Scott: Oh, the food, all these things go together.

534
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:53,670
Scott: In innovation, it didn't seem like anything went together.

535
00:36:53,751 --> 00:37:00,990
Scott: Like, every card had basically these random abilities Some of which would seem beneficial But you couldn't find any way to combo anything.

536
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:03,710
Scott: Because, like, what came up was so random.

537
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:09,190
Scott: And it's like, you know, Rym played this card that was like "Oh, draw until there's no castles".

538
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,270
Rym: And Scott got to do it before me.

539
00:37:11,451 --> 00:37:14,470
Scott: I had more castles or I had more symbols basically already out.

540
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:15,630
Scott: I think it was the castle symbol.

541
00:37:16,473 --> 00:37:19,790
Scott: So I also got to do the ability And I got to do it first.

542
00:37:20,313 --> 00:37:29,189
Scott: So basically, I drew, Rym activated this thing But I basically got lucky And it was just tons of castles And I had all these free cards And I was able to score all of them.

543
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,250
Scott: And Rym drew the first card And it was like, "No castle".

544
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:34,367
Scott: And it's like, "Well, what the

545
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:34,610
Scott: fuck?"?

546
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:36,750
Scott: Yeah, that was random bullshit.

547
00:37:37,194 --> 00:37:40,730
Rym: And also different symbols don't appear In, or different abilities.

548
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:45,830
Scott: Castles only appear in levels one through three And certain other ones only appear at the end.

549
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:56,270
Rym: The game, basically, for an early player Or a noobish player Has minimal and often counter-intuitive directional heuristics And zero positional heuristics.

550
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,530
Scott: No positional heuristic, whatever.

551
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:06,109
Rym: You could not tell who was winning, who was losing, or whatever You couldn't, but directionally You couldn't tell if doing something was a good or a bad idea Unless you'd read all the cards.

552
00:38:06,454 --> 00:38:11,129
Rym: And even if you've read all the cards You would have, the game would take forever to play If you were actually trying to win.

553
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:16,790
Rym: So I think the people who play this game and like it Are not trying to win with all of their abilities.

554
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,619
Scott: They're just like, "Oh my god, look at all this random stuff Because if

555
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:26,705
Rym: you're trying to win this game You have to check on conditions And read everything on the board regularly And the game is not-

556
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,575
Scott: You have to count everyone's number of exposed symbols Every time you're about to make an action And there's

557
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:31,529
Rym: a lot of symbols.

558
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:37,030
Scott: Yeah, there's no way you could decide what to do During other people's turns either Because during their turns they get symbols.

559
00:38:37,294 --> 00:38:38,270
Scott: So it gets to your turn.

560
00:38:38,331 --> 00:38:41,150
Scott: The guy to your right just played some cards Giving him more symbols.

561
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,970
Scott: And so did other people too Because they maybe joined in on the action.

562
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,750
Scott: And now you have to count again Like, "Hey, if I do this action Rym will be able to join in on it.

563
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,026
Scott: If I do this action Jess will be the victim of it,

564
00:38:52,107 --> 00:38:52,269
Scott: right?".

565
00:38:52,431 --> 00:39:02,730
Rym: It's like there's no- You have to- So it takes forever Forever And different cards have different sets of actions That go in order And the order that you do things is really important.

566
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:03,890
Rym: But it's also confusing.

567
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,350
Rym: Like I'll read a card right now Invention.

568
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,869
Rym: It has a four on it.

569
00:39:09,236 --> 00:39:14,370
Rym: Action You may splay right any one color of your cards Currently splayed left.

570
00:39:14,873 --> 00:39:17,429
Rym: If you do, draw and score a four.

571
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:19,170
Rym: And then there's the second action.

572
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:25,390
Rym: If you have five colors splayed Each in any direction Claim the wonder achievement.

573
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:27,749
Scott: Fuck that.

574
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:34,810
Scott: So that's an additional way to claim the wonder achievement In addition to- May also be claimed by invention from age four Renaissance.

575
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:38,670
Rym: So it says that on the wonder And wonder can also be claimed.

576
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:40,810
Rym: Claim the special achievement immediately.

577
00:39:41,073 --> 00:39:44,570
Rym: If you have five colors on the board Each is splayed either up or right.

578
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:53,009
Scott: How could anyone possibly have like play tested or like Chest and balanced every freaking thing in this game?

579
00:39:53,454 --> 00:39:56,950
Rym: If this is your game If you play this game the way we played Puerto Rico?

580
00:39:57,091 --> 00:39:59,389
Scott: Hey that guy on the left I think is a guy I play netrunner with.

581
00:39:59,573 --> 00:39:59,966
Scott: It might be.

582
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:01,770
Rym: These are all board game geek pictures.

583
00:40:02,282 --> 00:40:03,870
Rym: Yeah I can't get back to that picture.

584
00:40:03,974 --> 00:40:10,487
Rym: Okay Anyway Oh and uh Scott we were playing the game wrong Were we?

585
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:12,650
Rym: So here's a screenshot from the rules.

586
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:14,550
Rym: Fun a mandatory rule.

587
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:15,408
Rym: You must have it.

588
00:40:15,554 --> 00:40:17,010
Rym: Oh So yeah we were cheating.

589
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:17,490
Scott: We're cheating.

590
00:40:18,313 --> 00:40:19,346
Rym: Maybe that's why we didn't like it.

591
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:20,506
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

592
00:40:21,776 --> 00:40:23,050
Scott: It's a game you see everywhere.

593
00:40:23,252 --> 00:40:28,590
Scott: If everyone wants a full set including expansions Let me know because I got them The game.

594
00:40:29,238 --> 00:40:30,169
Rym: I want to make one more point.

595
00:40:30,632 --> 00:40:40,290
Rym: It introduces a ton of its own terminology Which further makes the game difficult for a noob to play Because noobs can play games like seven wonders.

596
00:40:40,914 --> 00:40:43,029
Rym: They usually understand what a draft is.

597
00:40:43,754 --> 00:40:45,569
Rym: They understand what draw a card is.

598
00:40:46,012 --> 00:40:47,990
Rym: But this game doesn't use words like draw.

599
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:49,190
Scott: It uses words like splay.

600
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,849
Scott: Yeah What the fuck is a splay?

601
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:54,390
Rym: And the terminology doesn't really fit.

602
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:56,609
Scott: The instruction manual has a glossary in it.

603
00:40:56,711 --> 00:41:00,750
Rym: Yes It has a glossary for things that really could have been described more simply.

604
00:41:01,352 --> 00:41:10,870
Rym: And this is all a consequence of the fact that the game tries to do the glory to Rome thing Where the cards are the economy and are all the actions.

605
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:13,250
Rym: But they tried to do too much with it.

606
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,550
Scott: Glory to Rome is much better than this game by a lot.

607
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,469
Rym: I played glory to Rome again after trying to play this just to see.

608
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,142
Rym: And no glory to Rome is the.

609
00:41:21,302 --> 00:41:23,810
Rym: it does a lot of the same kind of things But so much more.

610
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,338
Scott: And here's the thing you know.

611
00:41:25,478 --> 00:41:38,110
Scott: even though the games may not be similar mechanically Right even though they're dissimilar physically They fill the same niche as what you need in your board gaming library A. you know moderately complex mid-length you know small package.

612
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:40,909
Rym: There's no way this game is mid-length if you're trying to win.

613
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:42,018
Scott: That's true.

614
00:41:42,642 --> 00:41:45,010
Scott: but I'm just saying is you know Can you imagine playing this?

615
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,650
Scott: It fills the same niche in a board gamer's library of owned games.

616
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:52,410
Scott: So if you have glory to Rome or I guess Euchronia is right you don't need this.

617
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,870
Rym: Can you imagine playing this game with someone who doesn't take the turn?

618
00:41:56,752 --> 00:41:58,509
Scott: Yeah I imagine stabbing.

619
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:03,877
Rym: So I'm gonna say don't bother with innovation If you like it.

620
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,349
Rym: I'd really like to hear why.

621
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:08,490
Scott: Yeah uh maybe we just misunderstand this game.

622
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:18,269
Rym: Yeah tell us tell us I implore you tell us why we're wrong Tell us why we should play this game again rather than just immediately getting rid of it Having not even finished one game.

623
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:20,569
Scott: Okay let's talk about a different game now.

624
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:23,068
Scott: This village is much better than innovation.

625
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,029
Scott: Village is the game Not perfect.

626
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:32,278
Rym: Village is the game you might have seen it where there's a bunch of graveyards And you basically put peasants out to work in the fields and then they die Thematically.

627
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:33,470
Scott: this game is incredible.

628
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:39,890
Scott: This game had the best like mechanic theme uh synergy that I've seen in a long ass time.

629
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:46,510
Rym: Yep send peasants into the field to do work And then the plague comes and kills some of them and they go into graves.

630
00:42:46,771 --> 00:42:47,033
Scott: Right.

631
00:42:47,094 --> 00:42:49,290
Scott: so basically there's a village.

632
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:55,853
Scott: You are a family of people who work and live in the village Sort of like Agricola but you're you know right You're.

633
00:42:56,235 --> 00:42:58,610
Scott: it's a more of a shared space than Agricola right?

634
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:05,550
Scott: Then you know right and on your turn you sort of you know you put your guys out there to work The different places in the village.

635
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:10,070
Scott: It's like oh you go visit church You go work in the craftsman's workshop.

636
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:13,349
Scott: You go traveling around to other villages and see what's there.

637
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:18,490
Scott: You go try to you know grow in politics maybe become the mayor or some shit right.

638
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,670
Scott: You tell your go farm we need food go to the marketplace and sell some shit.

639
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:23,197
Scott: We got shit.

640
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:23,764
Scott: we got to sell.

641
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:25,055
Scott: right We just made some shit.

642
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:25,559
Scott: let's sell it.

643
00:43:26,102 --> 00:43:27,169
Scott: and you tell your people what to do.

644
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:32,341
Scott: But over time your family gets fucking old Because they're old ass you know.

645
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:34,050
Scott: and you make babies of course And plague.

646
00:43:34,372 --> 00:43:37,610
Scott: Yeah but this plague and people get old and die.

647
00:43:38,153 --> 00:43:48,409
Scott: So when they die they sort of if they're awesome enough They go into the history book of the village to be remembered by the villagers for you know And there's actually a little book and you put the dead people into the book.

648
00:43:48,872 --> 00:43:53,700
Rym: And if they if the book is full then they go to unmarked graves Unmarked graves.

649
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,549
Scott: or if they're not worthy of being in the book They go in unmarked graves.

650
00:43:58,152 --> 00:44:03,779
Rym: Now the game has a sort of economy kind of like Agricola and all these other games Where you're placing workers.

651
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:05,050
Rym: they're getting cubes.

652
00:44:05,332 --> 00:44:07,570
Rym: You're spending those cubes in other places to do stuff.

653
00:44:07,873 --> 00:44:16,429
Rym: You've got a bunch of places you can level people up Each of the areas of the game is really well self-contained Really well explained makes sense.

654
00:44:17,773 --> 00:44:20,469
Rym: The game's just kind of simple after you actually play it.

655
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:27,829
Scott: Yeah basically when you put your workers out Each space you can put a worker has cubes allotted there And when you put a worker you get a cube.

656
00:44:28,452 --> 00:44:32,330
Scott: So what'll happen is a place will have like an orange cube and a black cube.

657
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,305
Scott: So it's like oh I put my guy here I do the action for that space.

658
00:44:35,365 --> 00:44:36,230
Scott: I take the orange cube.

659
00:44:36,854 --> 00:44:39,070
Scott: Now only one more person can go there this round.

660
00:44:39,191 --> 00:44:40,969
Scott: If they go there they must take the black cubes.

661
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,596
Rym: Black cubes bad Which is a bad.

662
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:43,440
Scott: it's a plague cube.

663
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:45,170
Scott: it's not a useful cube like the orange one.

664
00:44:45,592 --> 00:44:51,829
Scott: So it's like you sort of have to decide well I want a pink cube But I don't want to do the action that the where the pink cubes are right.

665
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,989
Scott: now I want to do the action where the orange cubes are.

666
00:44:54,412 --> 00:44:58,110
Scott: So it forces you to make some you know slightly tricky normal board game decisions.

667
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,029
Rym: Now interestingly you have to keep going until all the cubes get picked up.

668
00:45:01,352 --> 00:45:06,590
Scott: So eventually it's all black cubes and people are like ah Well you also sort of want to take the black cubes right.

669
00:45:07,092 --> 00:45:12,850
Scott: It's not necessarily bad to have your people die off Because then you can get into the book first.

670
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:15,670
Scott: That is a way of scoring points and legitimate strategy.

671
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:18,531
Scott: Also I think the game ends when the book fills right Now.

672
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:24,629
Rym: that is actually a problem I had with the game's theme The game the way it's mechanically set up.

673
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:27,990
Rym: You feel like you want to delay and avoid death.

674
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:29,515
Scott: That yeah you want.

675
00:45:29,555 --> 00:45:38,130
Scott: the less you die the more people you have on the board doing things The more time you have to spend actions collecting victory points from the board.

676
00:45:38,891 --> 00:45:46,910
Scott: But if people die sooner you get more victory points by being more prominent Well-known ancestors in the history of the village.

677
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,217
Scott: So how do you balance that?

678
00:45:48,277 --> 00:45:53,113
Scott: this person if they keep working can get five more points But if they die now I can get four points Now.

679
00:45:53,154 --> 00:45:55,062
Rym: that's my problem with the game Blocking someone.

680
00:45:55,103 --> 00:45:56,897
Scott: if I do that The game on your turn.

681
00:45:56,937 --> 00:46:01,529
Rym: like you can spend actions you move this clock around And someone dies every time it goes around.

682
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:14,389
Rym: The problem is that all the mechanics of the game feel like you're avoiding death But intentionally spending actions to kill your guys is a huge part of the strategy A huge part.

683
00:46:14,811 --> 00:46:19,970
Rym: I was regularly intentionally trying to die as fast as possible to beat Scott into the graveyard.

684
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:21,156
Scott: Early in the game.

685
00:46:21,176 --> 00:46:23,910
Scott: I was trying not to die because I basically wanted to get a setup.

686
00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:25,587
Rym: Yeah and I said fuck that die die die.

687
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,877
Scott: And I basically picked.

688
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:29,535
Scott: you know I was like which part of the game Should I?

689
00:46:29,555 --> 00:46:32,692
Scott: I was like I'm gonna focus on getting points from like a single source Because they.

690
00:46:33,135 --> 00:46:38,310
Scott: it's one of those games where if you keep focusing on one area You get more and more stuff from that area.

691
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,424
Scott: It doesn't encourage diversification like Agricola.

692
00:46:41,444 --> 00:46:42,770
Scott: it encourages specification.

693
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,692
Rym: There's very little reason to diversify and you're pretty much punished for doing it Right.

694
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:51,343
Scott: so it's like I basically did the bare minimum in every place And I maximized traveling.

695
00:46:51,403 --> 00:46:52,530
Scott: why did I choose traveling?

696
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:57,469
Scott: I didn't calculate how much points things are worth And you know which area would be the best to specialize in.

697
00:46:58,012 --> 00:47:02,890
Scott: I philosophically like the theme of traveling like yeah get out of this peasant ass village And make something of yourself.

698
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:06,739
Rym: Yeah I saw you go in there and I ignored that entire part of the game Which made it easy.

699
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:14,410
Rym: I almost maxed it out Yeah and I counted and I realized if you had maxed it out It wouldn't account for even half the points I would get just doing the trading.

700
00:47:14,591 --> 00:47:21,929
Scott: Yeah you were doing the marketplace which I could have specialized in as well And the marketplace way more points way better than freaking traveling.

701
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:23,429
Rym: Also I maxed out the church.

702
00:47:24,397 --> 00:47:25,128
Scott: I did some church too.

703
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:26,070
Scott: You tried the church.

704
00:47:26,272 --> 00:47:26,716
Scott: I also.

705
00:47:26,757 --> 00:47:27,625
Scott: I did more town hall.

706
00:47:27,787 --> 00:47:29,390
Rym: also I ignored the town hall mostly.

707
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,557
Scott: Town hall was pretty good actually.

708
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:37,650
Scott: but yeah if I played it again I would basically Fight for the freaking workshops and the marketplace and fuck and only do the other shit.

709
00:47:37,951 --> 00:47:41,810
Scott: Also keep in mind the workplace and the workshops and the marketplace.

710
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,343
Scott: Sort of grease the wheels of everything else.

711
00:47:44,404 --> 00:47:50,701
Scott: so if you focus on those Doing the other things becomes a little bit easier If you have wagons from doing all that shit.

712
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,950
Scott: it's just way easier to travel because you have wagons.

713
00:47:53,472 --> 00:47:56,808
Rym: The game's fun and I would actually recommend it for most board game people.

714
00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:03,150
Rym: I know I don't want to buy it and I don't really want to play it again because it feels too simple.

715
00:48:03,231 --> 00:48:04,490
Rym: I feel like if I played it.

716
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:09,209
Scott: It's one of those lower level board games like in the settlers level And it's like we personally have moved beyond that.

717
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:13,129
Scott: But if you're still down there in settlers land where like settlers is a good game for you.

718
00:48:13,632 --> 00:48:16,710
Scott: I think this might actually be a better intro to euro game.

719
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:19,410
Rym: This is a better intro to games like Calus.

720
00:48:19,994 --> 00:48:22,470
Scott: This goes in between I think Carcassonne and Calus.

721
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,137
Scott: Like you play Carcassonne you play settlers.

722
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:26,547
Scott: you're not ready to jump to Calus.

723
00:48:26,587 --> 00:48:29,017
Scott: Puerto Rico Village goes right in the middle.

724
00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:31,990
Scott: perfect game for the people at that level of euro gaming.

725
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:34,481
Scott: You know it's clean it's fun.

726
00:48:34,522 --> 00:48:36,350
Scott: the theme is amazing with the dead people

727
00:48:36,611 --> 00:48:51,464
Rym: And also like here's an example the game limits you like you can go get grain but you can only Get so much but you can buy a thing that'll let you get more grain and the game does not punish You heavily for not being crazily optimized like in Agricola.

728
00:48:52,006 --> 00:48:59,250
Rym: if you fuck up with your food You're fucked it's true and this game fucking up is not nearly as directly bad.

729
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,737
Scott: Yeah it's like what's the worst you can do?

730
00:49:00,878 --> 00:49:03,954
Scott: some of your people die sooner like a guy who would Have been useful.

731
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:06,089
Scott: who was maybe you're maybe a guy who's hanging out in a workshop.

732
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:13,810
Scott: he was Living there and he was gonna help you produce wagons really fast but he died because he was The oldest person and you accidentally had to take plague cubes because you miscalculated.

733
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:18,044
Scott: Okay now he's in the craftsmanship book and he got a lot of points.

734
00:49:18,325 --> 00:49:20,052
Rym: but it's like send a guy to get Some grain.

735
00:49:20,072 --> 00:49:21,419
Rym: you've got some grain now you can.

736
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,870
Rym: you can get two grain at a time you can only hold five.

737
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:32,213
Rym: Anyway so it limits the amount of calculation you need to do for moderately successful directional Heuristics.

738
00:49:32,294 --> 00:49:34,646
Scott: yep and a lot of times there just aren't that many choices.

739
00:49:34,666 --> 00:49:43,497
Scott: because as the cubes Disappear it's like okay you have to put a guy you have one you have a guy you can put him either in The traveling or in the church.

740
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:45,142
Scott: I guess it's the church.

741
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,710
Scott: okay you know a lot of simple decisions.

742
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,660
Scott: It's not a lot of tough decisions like Agricola has.

743
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,883
Rym: so yeah super fun.

744
00:49:51,944 --> 00:49:57,146
Rym: but I probably won't ever Play it again except maybe in polite company if someone else busted out.

745
00:49:57,226 --> 00:49:59,535
Scott: yeah it's just sort of you Know fun sort of simple.

746
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:07,221
Scott: uh you know I wouldn't like seek it out I wouldn't pull it out of a library But it's cute not bad not you know?

747
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:07,963
Scott: it's not like.

748
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,110
Scott: I wouldn't avoid it like I would say innovation.

749
00:50:10,351 --> 00:50:17,911
Rym: Or uh skyline uh no or ground floor ground floor skylines the dice one which is also meh but ground Floor was awful.

750
