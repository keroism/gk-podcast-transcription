00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,549
Rym: It's Thursday, February 21st, 2013.

2
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:18,344
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight on the GeekNights Book Club.

3
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:21,653
Rym: It's The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

4
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:23,980
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:36,422
Rym: So for once I'm sitting down to do GeekNights and I have a plethora of things I could say, an opening bit perhaps, some anecdote from my life.

6
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:37,787
Scott: I got one of those.

7
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:40,279
Rym: I had the thought I realized, you know what I should do?

8
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:42,230
Rym: And we've had this thought often on the show.

9
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:48,150
Rym: I should tell one of them and save the rest for some dry time in the future.

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,752
Scott: You'll forget it.

11
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:54,153
Rym: And then I was going to instead make my bit about how I forgot about all these things.

12
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:59,940
Rym: And then I actually, in the last few minutes, legit forgot one of the three things I wanted to talk about.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,550
Rym: Like I literally cannot remember it.

14
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,957
Scott: That makes room for mine, which I remembered.

15
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:05,931
Rym: So instead I want to talk about centaur bondage porn.

16
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:09,037
Scott: Okay, let's not talk about that either.

17
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:11,702
Rym: So I swear this all links together.

18
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:20,402
Rym: So let's back up a bit to February 20th.

19
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:21,004
Rym: Yesterday.

20
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:23,130
Scott: Why are you backing up with your centaur bondage?

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,031
Rym: So my friend.

22
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,934
Rym: Your friend, the centaur.

23
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:27,597
Scott: That's backing up.

24
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:37,075
Rym: If I knew a centaur, that'd be the chill ones like in a bleach.

25
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:37,476
Rym: That's okay.

26
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:38,459
Rym: All right.

27
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,502
Scott: Everyone just fast forward.

28
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:43,034
Rym: Heels are our good friend.

29
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:44,681
Scott: Heels on the centaur.

30
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,288
Scott: I thought they have hooves, not heels.

31
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:48,116
Rym: And the quote is conversation.

32
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:48,839
Rym: I just had at work.

33
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:52,052
Rym: Is that a horse hanging from the ceiling in your area?

34
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:52,634
Rym: Yes.

35
00:01:52,674 --> 00:01:53,176
Rym: Yes it is.

36
00:01:53,196 --> 00:02:00,275
Rym: And he tweets a picture and it's looks like it's a horse suspended from the ceiling in like their office.

37
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:01,197
Rym: Okay.

38
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,545
Rym: So let's go back like a month.

39
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:11,550
Rym: I was unrelatedly because I had found a, a little mashup of all the, my little pony characters, the centaurs.

40
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,514
Rym: that was really well drawn.

41
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:17,276
Rym: I thought it was funny because Applejack was carrying a kind of fan shit.

42
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:20,309
Rym: So Applejack's here in like this X, X, X jug and like a NASCAR thing.

43
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:21,032
Rym: It was just, it was fun.

44
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:26,471
Scott: Triple X porn pony, my little pony centaurs that are backing up with your friend.

45
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:29,059
Rym: I didn't say anything about backing up anyway.

46
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:36,098
Rym: So I was looking for a, I wanted to find a frumpy centaur.

47
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:42,395
Scott: Like I needed like, the fact that it was centaur, my little ponies wasn't good enough for you.

48
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:43,521
Scott: They had to be frumpy.

49
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:49,120
Rym: So I had this idea to make a little mashup, like one of those like fantasy reality things.

50
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:56,990
Rym: So I wanted a dog headed girl, badly drawn equivalent of a centaur where spooky goes helping you with these internet searches.

51
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,417
Rym: And in the course of looking for that, I saw what could only be described spooky ghost as a centaur in bondage.

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,601
Scott: Okay.

53
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:08,556
Rym: So that would, that just got filed away as, yeah, that's the thing that exists.

54
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:10,248
Rym: Probably should have expected that that exists.

55
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:13,259
Rym: Probably should have expected that for right there.

56
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:13,660
Rym: Yeah.

57
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,733
Rym: I mean, uh, there's probably porn of, let's see everything.

58
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:22,007
Rym: Let's go with a Chain Chomp and Sonic the Hedgehog.

59
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:22,448
Rym: Okay.

60
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:22,749
Rym: Here we go.

61
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,378
Rym: Oh, you're actually going to Google it.

62
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:24,901
Scott: Why not?

63
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:25,263
Rym: All right.

64
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:26,872
Rym: Chain Chomps and Sonic the Hedgehog.

65
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:28,220
Scott: I searched for Chain Chomp porn.

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,944
Rym: All right.

67
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:31,977
Rym: Let's go with just Chain Chomp because the Sonic part might be.

68
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:32,679
Scott: Yup.

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,081
Scott: Okay.

70
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:37,582
Scott: So here's actually princess Toadstool getting all porny and there's a Chain Chomp there.

71
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:38,528
Scott: that's looking pretty angry.

72
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:39,612
Scott: She's sort of holding its chain.

73
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:42,822
Scott: I guess she's using it in a dominatrix fashion.

74
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:46,715
Scott: Like it's her dominatrix tool is this Chain Chomp.

75
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:47,337
Rym: All right.

76
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,662
Rym: I'm glad we know that exists.

77
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:52,113
Scott: Oh, here is a womanized Chain Chomp.

78
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:53,739
Scott: that is all sexy.

79
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:53,820
Scott: Yup.

80
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:54,562
Scott: Rule.

81
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,951
Scott: And in fact it says right here, rule number 34.

82
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:59,299
Scott: If it exists, there is porn of it and Chain Chomp.

83
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:02,630
Rym: So yes, should have expected that.

84
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,325
Rym: And in general, point of advice, you look for anything related to centaurs.

85
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:07,932
Rym: is stuff out there.

86
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:13,252
Rym: So anyway, I didn't find a frumpy enough centaur and I gave up on this gif I wanted to make.

87
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:22,641
Rym: And in the course of that, I saw this like a centaur hanging upside down, like suspension style, like ready to be in porn.

88
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:24,026
Scott: Ah, Rym.

89
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:25,410
Scott: This is a great opening video.

90
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,480
Rym: So I remember this and then I see this tweet.

91
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:31,610
Rym: So I'm like, I basically tell the tale of that.

92
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,757
Rym: if I found this picture, I can't believe true facts.

93
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:36,981
Rym: So he responded link please.

94
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:42,513
Rym: I have a conundrum.

95
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:44,779
Rym: You see, I saw this one.

96
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:48,589
Rym: I can't, I don't, I can't find it again.

97
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:50,076
Rym: I don't want to search for it.

98
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:52,208
Rym: Cause remember I was searching for frumpy centaurs.

99
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:55,019
Rym: I was not searching for like bondage centaur.

100
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,585
Rym: Do not want to search for that.

101
00:04:57,368 --> 00:05:08,990
Rym: So if anyone has a picture of a centaur hanging upside down and what can be described as something like could be described as bondage gear, I need you to send that to our friend heels.

102
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,975
Scott: Why don't you just make one?

103
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:13,654
Rym: Because it'll be just as good as the drawings of Lamy as we did the other night.

104
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:14,116
Scott: Sure.

105
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:14,598
Scott: All right.

106
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:18,598
Scott: Anyone who is fast forwarding as instructed, now is the time to stop fast forwarding.

107
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,711
Rym: You realize you have to say that really, really slowly or they won't hear you.

108
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:34,500
Scott: If you are fast forwarding as instructed, this is the time to stop and return to the normal playing speed.

109
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:34,721
Scott: Right.

110
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,288
Rym: I remembered my other two opening bits.

111
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:38,882
Rym: One of them is I ate at a restaurant that's really good called Benoit.

112
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:40,008
Rym: It's French place.

113
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:41,133
Scott: I know about that place.

114
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:41,374
Scott: Yeah.

115
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:42,299
Rym: I liked that place a lot.

116
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:43,223
Rym: I went there last night.

117
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:48,231
Rym: So I had a dessert that can only be described as one of those ridiculous things that rich people eat.

118
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,382
Rym: It was bread, like angel food.

119
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:53,450
Rym: It was almost like angel food cake, but like a bread.

120
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:56,162
Rym: And they brought it to me in this huge silver platter.

121
00:05:56,182 --> 00:06:03,009
Rym: And then they opened the top and just sit in there and then they poured Armagnac over it, which seems to be the bread.

122
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:03,290
Rym: Yeah.

123
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,841
Rym: And then they covered it in this like whipped creme fraiche.

124
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:07,623
Scott: So the king's poo.

125
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:14,000
Rym: And I can't say that it was necessarily good, but it was weird.

126
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:20,184
Scott: Well, creme fraiche sort of unadulterated like that is a little, uh, it's got a weird taste to it.

127
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:22,358
Rym: I think it was creme fraiche whipped with sugar or something.

128
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:22,579
Scott: Yeah.

129
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,806
Scott: But creme fraiche, you know, is basically sour cream, but it has this extra sort of little aftertaste.

130
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:31,346
Scott: It's sort of, you don't want to go straight with it, but if you cook it into something, it disappears.

131
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:33,576
Rym: But sour cream, like I'll just eat a whole spoonful of that.

132
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,484
Rym: Yeah.

133
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:36,367
Scott: Sour cream is the best.

134
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:38,637
Rym: The third thing I've been updating my tumbler.

135
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:40,768
Rym: I think I've updated my tumbler in last week.

136
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:45,688
Rym: More times than I've updated any blog I've ever had a moment now because it's not GeekNights.

137
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:48,299
Rym: Anyway, this is like the stuff that doesn't make the GeekNights cut.

138
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:48,822
Scott: Okay.

139
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:57,933
Scott: So my opening bit is, uh, you know, we did an episode a long time on battle lore, which, you know, Rym hated a lot more than I hated.

140
00:06:57,993 --> 00:06:58,796
Rym: terrible game.

141
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:02,507
Scott: Uh, but of course it's a two player war game.

142
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,706
Scott: That's not so complex, but then again, not completely simple.

143
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:13,904
Scott: It's, you know, sort of a middle of the road war game and I paid a lot of money for it and it was hot for a few minutes and they made a bunch of expansions and it disappeared.

144
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:19,413
Scott: And the only game in that series that seems to still be around is memoir 44, which is basically the same game with a different theme.

145
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:23,712
Rym: Uh, however, having read the rules to both, I think memoir 44 would be fun.

146
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:25,079
Rym: I'm thinking about getting a copy of it.

147
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,983
Scott: It's the same game.

148
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,672
Rym: Not quite what's different.

149
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:30,284
Rym: The core mechanic is not the problem with battle lore.

150
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:35,050
Rym: The problem with battle lore is that the magic system and all that stuff they put on top of that magic system.

151
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:35,633
Rym: we did.

152
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:36,256
Rym: We didn't.

153
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:36,657
Rym: Yeah.

154
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:39,290
Rym: We played the base game and the scenarios were so simple.

155
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:39,912
Rym: It was pointless.

156
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:45,809
Rym: We did play two games of it with the magic and it was just stupid.

157
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:47,476
Scott: I don't remember playing with the magic.

158
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:52,276
Scott: Anyway, so the game got was not played even if I wanted to play it and it takes it.

159
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:56,756
Scott: Even if I did want to play it, the setup takes a long time so it wasn't really worth it.

160
00:07:57,118 --> 00:07:58,384
Scott: Uh, so I tried to sell it.

161
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:08,084
Scott: Finally I got off my ass and tried to sell it and someone in New Zealand wanted it and I was like, but then they said they, I was like, are you sure the shipping's going to be like a fortune?

162
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:08,990
Scott: And they said, okay.

163
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:10,597
Scott: And they PayPal'd me a fortune.

164
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,203
Scott: So I said, okay.

165
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:17,985
Scott: And I went to the post office to mail it and I expected to go to the post office and have this be a pain in the ass.

166
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:21,478
Scott: And of course it was a pain in the ass.

167
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,269
Rym: Ah, you set that up like, and it wasn't.

168
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:25,273
Rym: And everything was awesome.

169
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:28,667
Scott: It was, I went there, I needed a box to put this in.

170
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:29,611
Rym: You didn't already have a box.

171
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:32,121
Scott: They didn't have a box of appropriate size.

172
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,008
Rym: Wait, here's your problem.

173
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:37,724
Rym: You went to the post office expecting them to have the box for you.

174
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:38,990
Rym: You should have, you go to.

175
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,135
Scott: the box is there.

176
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:40,578
Rym: Yes.

177
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:45,102
Rym: God, you go to the post office with just like a fucking letter and you're like, Hey, can I get an envelope for this shit?

178
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:45,987
Scott: They have envelopes.

179
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:46,932
Rym: You don't do that.

180
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:49,683
Rym: You, you package up ahead of time and you show up anyway.

181
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:51,470
Scott: So they had boxes.

182
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,501
Rym: You're the reason there's lines at the post office.

183
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:54,769
Scott: They were not out there.

184
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:55,875
Scott: They were out behind.

185
00:08:55,915 --> 00:09:00,118
Scott: They, I had to wait like, and this other guy was also, he was trying to mail camera equipment to Brazil.

186
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,827
Scott: He bought like a Canon EOS.

187
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:03,314
Scott: He was trying to send to his friend in Brazil.

188
00:09:03,615 --> 00:09:05,485
Scott: We had to wait for them to go and find boxes.

189
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,208
Scott: It took like 15 minutes.

190
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,956
Rym: Bring your own goddamn box.

191
00:09:08,036 --> 00:09:08,116
Scott: Okay.

192
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:08,920
Scott: Where's he going to get one?

193
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:14,080
Rym: The box store, which is UPS stores have box.

194
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,063
Scott: I go to UPS.

195
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,130
Scott: They're going to want me to mail my shit from UPS.

196
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,293
Rym: You can just buy boxes.

197
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:19,659
Rym: There's staples has boxes.

198
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,402
Rym: Office Depot.

199
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:23,255
Scott: Anyways, there's one next to my office.

200
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:24,823
Scott: That's far away from my office.

201
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,311
Rym: There's probably one near your office too.

202
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:27,574
Scott: There's one here in Queens.

203
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:30,001
Scott: Anyway, then right.

204
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,265
Scott: I had to fill out these forms.

205
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:35,581
Scott: No pens, no pens to fill out the customs form anywhere.

206
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:36,385
Scott: Not one pen.

207
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:40,529
Scott: I felt like doing that thing where you go to the bank and grab a fistful of pens and bring it in the post office.

208
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:41,011
Rym: So you know what?

209
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:43,482
Rym: The chase mag near me doesn't have any accessible pens for people.

210
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:44,345
Rym: Any.

211
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:48,445
Scott: then they make you buy some tape because they don't just give you tape.

212
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:51,518
Rym: And then I got to have four friends to play the D the DS game.

213
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,040
Scott: Exactly.

214
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,830
Scott: And then had to wait in this incredible line.

215
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:55,814
Scott: That was ridiculous.

216
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:56,737
Rym: You know what?

217
00:09:56,898 --> 00:09:57,360
Rym: You know what?

218
00:09:57,741 --> 00:10:00,572
Rym: If you already have it boxed, there's machines.

219
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:02,398
Scott: No, the machine was out of order.

220
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:07,396
Rym: If that machine's out of order, whatever I'm attempting to mail doesn't get mailed.

221
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:09,183
Scott: And I was mailing internationally.

222
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:18,744
Scott: And when I finally got up to the counter, the person really had a hard time figuring out what to type into the computer to make this thing send and such.

223
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,014
Scott: And I was like, this is all you do all day.

224
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:26,377
Scott: It's like there's 20, there's 10 people here now who are sending international things and you don't know what to do.

225
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:27,420
Rym: Not your first day here.

226
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:30,892
Scott: One employee of post office.

227
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:39,884
Rym: that at a post office, the only people who are in that line are people who are there doing something complicated or need help dressing themselves.

228
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,248
Rym: One of the two.

229
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:44,941
Rym: There is no person in that line with an easy trends.

230
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:48,254
Scott: I was just sending a standard international package.

231
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:48,636
Rym: Yeah.

232
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:49,500
Rym: That's already crazy.

233
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,485
Scott: Which costs how much?

234
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:52,535
Scott: Guess how much it costs to send the package to.

235
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:57,053
Rym: So is it just battle or were they expansions or with the Epic board in a box?

236
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:59,104
Scott: I didn't even put peanuts and shit in there.

237
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:01,014
Scott: I was just like, I'm assuming you said customs.

238
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:01,516
Rym: It's a gift.

239
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:02,260
Scott: Yup.

240
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,849
Rym: Did you, you're not going to pay a duty though.

241
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:05,577
Rym: You're going to pass that through to who you're sending it to.

242
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,654
Scott: I didn't, I, they stay accepted it and they're mailing it.

243
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:09,781
Scott: I don't give a fuck what happens.

244
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:10,104
Scott: Okay.

245
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:11,090
Rym: But you said gift, right?

246
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:11,310
Rym: Yup.

247
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:11,812
Rym: All right.

248
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,237
Rym: I'm going to say $74.

249
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,244
Scott: You're pretty close.

250
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:20,748
Rym: It was like, remember when we had for sale, I shipped them and I learned a lot about how to ship shit.

251
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:21,833
Scott: It was like 70 something.

252
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:23,098
Scott: Yeah.

253
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,564
Scott: Cause a lot of money.

254
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:25,166
Rym: I know what's up.

255
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:27,113
Rym: I FedEx shit around the world all the time for work.

256
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,639
Scott: FedEx is way more than post office.

257
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,241
Rym: Yeah.

258
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:34,171
Rym: But you get a lot of things.

259
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:45,863
Scott: The price is actually all even out in the end, but yeah, there are international flat rate boxes, but, and battle or meets the weight requirement, but they don't have a flat rate international box that battle oral fit in.

260
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:46,224
Rym: Yeah.

261
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:56,329
Rym: The point of the flat rate box is that you can only fit so much into it, but if the board gate, I could probably fit fucking Puerto Rico and one of those motherfuckers fit just a bunch of polonium in there.

262
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:56,912
Rym: Just fill it up.

263
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,162
Scott: Well, that would exceed the weight limit.

264
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:00,950
Scott: There's a weight limit and a size limit.

265
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,643
Scott: The size limit is the box and the weight limit is a number.

266
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:09,809
Scott: They actually did have a scale there that was surprisingly easy to figure out, to calculate the price.

267
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,135
Rym: Scales are not generally complicated.

268
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:19,258
Rym: You need no, but the two buttons, maybe tar and calibrate they all the scale.

269
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:23,375
Scott: Also you could type things in and it would tell you how much money it costs to send to different places.

270
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:28,618
Scott: So, and that was pretty, it wasn't exactly accurate, but it was pretty accurate.

271
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:29,322
Scott: You could choose it.

272
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:36,681
Scott: They had a little piece of paper that told you all the country codes in case you didn't know, and you type it in and you choose the kind of postage you want and then it tells you the number.

273
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:41,061
Rym: You know, this is an aside when it comes, you know, there's country codes for phone numbers too, right?

274
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:41,844
Rym: Yep.

275
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:47,383
Rym: In my experience, people in the entire rest of the world know that country codes exist.

276
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:51,540
Rym: Most people in the U S have no idea that country code is one.

277
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:54,150
Rym: No, they don't realize that's a country code.

278
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,278
Scott: They think Alexander Graham Bell's an American.

279
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:57,966
Scott: Therefore America is number one.

280
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:08,120
Rym: They think either that the one is just something you type when you dial long distance, because they don't realize long distance isn't a thing anymore.

281
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:08,542
Scott: Nope.

282
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:09,949
Rym: Or, but that's it.

283
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,815
Rym: They have no idea why that one is there.

284
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:21,184
Scott: It's phone numbers are, uh, they're the way DNS is supposed to be calm dot country dot kind of lore low area.

285
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:22,508
Rym: Well, you saw that XKCD.

286
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:25,658
Rym: nowadays it's country dot where you lived in the year 2000.

287
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:26,500
Rym: Exactly.

288
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:32,781
Scott: But it's, you know, it's, it's DNS calm dot whatever, you know, well.com dot, right?

289
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:33,623
Rym: Yeah.

290
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:39,182
Scott: It goes from, but the thing is addresses go from most specific to least specific.

291
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:44,101
Scott: We should Scott Rubin, no, no, no, no, no USA as opposed to USA.

292
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:44,423
Scott: No, no, no.

293
00:13:44,503 --> 00:13:44,925
Scott: It's got Ruben.

294
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:45,728
Scott: You know what I'm going to say?

295
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:46,271
Rym: You know what?

296
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:49,826
Rym: My phone number is really Rym at frontrowcrew.com.

297
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:52,536
Scott: Cause if you're going to call me, what the fuck?

298
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,009
Rym: I mean, seriously, what are you going to send me a fax?

299
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,611
Rym: What year?

300
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:57,536
Scott: What year is it?

301
00:13:57,596 --> 00:13:59,164
Rym: Are you going to send the pony express?

302
00:13:59,224 --> 00:13:59,787
Rym: Or I guess the center.

303
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:06,798
Scott: If I go to an old school fax machine and I faxed to your Google voice number, will it show up as a PDF or something in your Google voice?

304
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:07,159
Scott: Fuck.

305
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,648
Rym: If I know what the fuck is a fax.

306
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:10,611
Scott: Try it.

307
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,616
Rym: The last time I faxed something was in 2006.

308
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:14,979
Rym: I faxed one thing.

309
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:23,458
Rym: Sometimes I will use a fax to purchase order.

310
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:28,713
Scott: in like 2008, a few years ago, I basically used, I didn't actually send a fax.

311
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:37,815
Scott: I use sort of a fake fax work around as a way to scan from a scan from a fax machine.

312
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:47,422
Scott: Well, from a copier, which then sent an email to a fax number, which then went through a fax system and ended up in my work email box as a PDF.

313
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:55,165
Scott: So it's sort of a scan from a copy machine and it turned into a PDF in my outlook.

314
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:57,151
Scott: So yeah, that's all I got.

315
00:14:57,571 --> 00:14:57,912
Rym: All right.

316
00:14:58,613 --> 00:15:08,368
Rym: So at any rate, it's time for things of the day.

317
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:12,444
Rym: I've been looking around the internet looking for the best anime music videos.

318
00:15:12,464 --> 00:15:14,396
Rym: If you're not an anime fan, you don't care about that stuff.

319
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:20,027
Scott: And you're pretty much just picking the ones that we already knew from back in the day and you're reliving the nostalgia.

320
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:22,818
Scott: You haven't seen any good ones since we left college.

321
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:29,482
Rym: Actually, I've added a good portion of ones that I've seen in the last week that are relatively new.

322
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,626
Scott: Since you started looking.

323
00:15:31,308 --> 00:15:31,589
Rym: Yeah.

324
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:32,432
Rym: Since I started looking.

325
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:36,246
Scott: So you got a few, you got a big gap between say '05 and '12.

326
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:40,507
Rym: Actually, one of the ones that I found that was good was a contest winner from like '08.

327
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:44,724
Rym: But anyway, I do this in this episode because guys, it's GeekNights.

328
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:50,330
Rym: The whole point is to get the anime geeks into the video games, the video game geeks into the neckbeards and cross pollinate.

329
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:54,963
Rym: This anime music video is to a show called Panty and Stocking.

330
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:56,850
Rym: Just watched the video.

331
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,379
Rym: Imagine a dirty adult Powerpuff Girls.

332
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:03,579
Rym: and this video just makes the show look probably more awesome than it is, but the video is awesome.

333
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,490
Scott: It's more of a dirty adult Powerpuff Girls.

334
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,655
Scott: Gatekeepers, really.

335
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:10,712
Rym: Yeah, but I didn't think anyone listening to this show would know what Gatekeepers is.

336
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:11,535
Scott: No one probably does.

337
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:13,301
Rym: Dude, anime fans don't know that show.

338
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:15,148
Rym: Get open!

339
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:17,758
Rym: That was the biggest show for like a month and a half.

340
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:25,087
Scott: It was a big show for three weeks because it was the first DigiSub that you could just download from that one website.

341
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,874
Scott: Anime Keep or Anime Factory?

342
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:27,758
Scott: AnimeFactory.net.

343
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:32,135
Rym: Meanwhile, the first big DigiSub before that was the Escaflowne movie.

344
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:35,869
Scott: Those are pretty much the first two digital fansubs that were like...

345
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:40,619
Rym: Scott and I almost got kicked out of the RIT Anime Club because we told people they could go download the Escaflowne movie.

346
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:41,444
Scott: I don't remember that.

347
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:42,168
Rym: You don't remember that?

348
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:42,228
Rym: No.

349
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,536
Rym: That's Scott Johnson about that.

350
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:46,694
Rym: They saw we had that DVD and they talked about kicking all of us out of the club.

351
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:47,800
Scott: Okay.

352
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,885
Scott: They had an e-board meeting about it.

353
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:49,769
Scott: Okay.

354
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:52,017
Rym: That was with Tape Nazi.

355
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:53,923
Rym: I didn't want to say his full name on the show, but I almost did.

356
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:56,493
Rym: The first Tape Nazi.

357
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:57,801
Rym: The original Tape Nazi.

358
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:00,152
Scott: I don't know how it's any different from the fansubs they had already.

359
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:04,104
Rym: Because it was digital and that's how anime types are.

360
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:05,127
Rym: Anyway.

361
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:07,435
Scott: Anyway, so check this out.

362
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:17,670
Scott: There are a lot of things in the world that people think are impossible, but if you go to Zombocom, we know that the impossible becomes possible at Zombocom.

363
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,334
Rym: Before we go any further, as soon as you watch this, you're going to try to make noises with your throat.

364
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:25,108
Rym: You're going to be sitting there after you watch that scene today.

365
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:27,180
Scott: Don't hurt yourself unless you go to Zombocom first.

366
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,401
Rym: Yeah.

367
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,266
Rym: I already hurt myself.

368
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:29,872
Rym: We didn't go to Zombocom first.

369
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:32,437
Scott: It was a big mistake not visiting Zombocom.

370
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:32,918
Scott: I didn't clip.

371
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:38,831
Rym: The limiter kicked in.

372
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:39,173
Rym: Anyway.

373
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:43,829
Scott: Anyway, so this girl, her YouTube account is Disney Diva Seven.

374
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:44,973
Scott: I guess she's an opera singer.

375
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,056
Rym: She's the seventh one.

376
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:46,557
Scott: Sure.

377
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:56,686
Scott: She made this YouTube video of her singing the opera song from the fifth element, which is supposedly impossible.

378
00:17:56,767 --> 00:18:00,581
Scott: I mean, the original was sung by some opera person.

379
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:03,532
Scott: You can look it up on the internet with what I assume is a vocoder.

380
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:08,547
Scott: Oh, the original singer's voice is sung by Albanian soprano Inva Mula.

381
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:09,410
Scott: Right.

382
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:14,766
Scott: But Laura in this YouTube video sings it without any digital enhancements.

383
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:19,604
Rym: I've not tried to verify how 100% that is, but it looks legit to me.

384
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:20,388
Scott: It's pretty legit.

385
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:23,863
Scott: And you can hear her singing over the originals playing like on the track.

386
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:31,554
Rym: She didn't get like, she didn't get a karaoke track to be able to hit those notes and know you're hitting them because it's crazy.

387
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:35,411
Rym: Wait, there's a whole bunch of videos of people trying to sing it that are linked.

388
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:40,311
Scott: Well, only this one, which is actually successful because of Zombocom is the thing of the day.

389
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:42,441
Scott: The other ones watch at your own risk.

390
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:47,303
Rym: After this episode, I'm going to watch this one called me trying to sing the diva dance from the fifth element.

391
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:48,849
Rym: And it's uploaded by some dude.

392
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,476
Rym: And it's the picture of a dude trying to sing.

393
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,348
Rym: He's got the same pop filter that I have.

394
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:59,790
Scott: I wonder if anyone does it like pretending to shoot themselves at the end, pretending to get shot at the end.

395
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:02,153
Rym: All right.

396
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:02,314
Rym: Okay.

397
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,838
Rym: I'm done making stupid noises.

398
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,690
Scott: So the great Gatsby, I hope you guys met a moment.

399
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,694
Rym: Oh, you want to do a meta moment?

400
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:09,941
Scott: Well, we got to do a meta moment.

401
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:20,439
Rym: Well, maybe because we're going to be at PAX doing practical game theory, doing, uh, mastering game mechanics, doing possibly a third event and also enforcing.

402
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,866
Rym: So we're going to be all over the fuck place.

403
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:24,215
Rym: This is PAX East, by the way, 2013.

404
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:26,121
Scott: It's actually in a few fucking weeks.

405
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,145
Rym: Yeah.

406
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:27,466
Rym: Yeah.

407
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:28,590
Rym: We got to finish those panels.

408
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:29,592
Scott: Yeah.

409
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:30,555
Scott: I'll get to mine this weekend.

410
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,344
Scott: Um, other meta moments.

411
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:43,198
Scott: If you did not listen to the last episode, we, I am holding personally, this event that I came up with and decided not to shit talk, it's going to be pretty easy for me, but probably hard for you.

412
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:50,580
Scott: The front row crew official GeekNights game grand Prix 2013.

413
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,523
Scott: Here's how it works.

414
00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:57,720
Scott: We are going to compete and Sue see who is the best gamer amongst the listeners and forum people.

415
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:04,201
Scott: If you want to sign up, all you have to do is join the forum or sign into the forum, go to the thread.

416
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,164
Scott: It's the top thread.

417
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:10,484
Scott: post a comment before March 1st that says you're in, I will add your name to the Google doc.

418
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:12,572
Scott: We have almost 40 people on this thing.

419
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:13,916
Scott: It is going to be fierce.

420
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,547
Scott: Uh, we are using an F1 scoring system.

421
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:23,987
Scott: The top 10 positions in any particular round or Grand Prix, uh, will score championship points.

422
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:26,196
Scott: Uh, whoever has the most points.

423
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:29,050
Scott: after however, number of rounds I'm thinking four or five.

424
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:35,126
Rym: now guys, things like this champion, even super aguri is awesome in F1.

425
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:43,474
Rym: So even if you suck at games, if you want to try for this, the right around for so long, I know I've watched F1 since super aguri was around.

426
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:44,177
Rym: It's the longest.

427
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:53,175
Rym: I know if you get even one championship point in this thing, you'll have a lot of bragging rights over everyone who didn't participate and the majority of people in this thing.

428
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:53,476
Scott: Right.

429
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:57,514
Scott: So, and don't worry about, I mean, every round is going to be skill games.

430
00:20:57,554 --> 00:21:01,448
Scott: I'm never going to pick a rent, you know, a luck game or coin flip game.

431
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:01,549
Scott: Yeah.

432
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,832
Scott: I never, and if there is some luck in the game, which there could be, there will be luck mitigation rules.

433
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,357
Scott: The rules for each round.

434
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:16,881
Scott: I will be determined by me, judged by me, proved by me, everything master and may the odds be ever in your favor.

435
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:19,870
Scott: You can, you're going to need to do this.

436
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:25,868
Scott: probably a computer, uh, probably some sort of camera or other evidence gatherers.

437
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,764
Scott: So you can prove to the best of your abilities that your score is legit.

438
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:32,277
Scott: And then we might have some sort of challenge system.

439
00:21:32,297 --> 00:21:35,293
Scott: If someone thinks you cheated, which I don't think will be really foresee this.

440
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:41,896
Rym: The first task is like some Mario three thing and you get 40 identical stolen from YouTube machine assisted plays.

441
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:42,277
Scott: Yeah.

442
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:43,561
Scott: I think we'll be able to tell.

443
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:57,297
Scott: Um, and yeah, you just, you know, if you don't want to participate in a round or can't, you just don't and you get a zero, which you're probably going to get even if you do participate because even with the current number of entrance, 75% of people are going to get zeros.

444
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,320
Scott: Um, and oh, I'm going to try to make every round will be as accessible as possible.

445
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:15,146
Rym: I'm not going to do things which will, like, for example, if one of them is a feat of, you know, physical, like a running thing or something crazy out in the real world, it wouldn't be because some people don't have fucking legs.

446
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:19,286
Rym: I was about to say, but that, but are you going to go, how much are you going to include?

447
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,070
Rym: What if someone's blind?

448
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:24,372
Scott: Uh, well, I mean, if they're playing video games and reading the forum, they have something, right?

449
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:24,934
Scott: I mean, yeah.

450
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:31,825
Rym: So by not having legs, you're just counting a huge swath of games, many of which are actually eminently accessible to a lot of people.

451
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:32,187
Scott: Yeah.

452
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:40,228
Scott: But for example, DDR would require people to buy equipment, which they may not have a, you know, I wouldn't pick like a PlayStation three exclusive cause not everyone has a PlayStation three.

453
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:44,568
Scott: I wouldn't pick a game that requires a bad ass PC cause most people don't have a bad ass PC.

454
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:47,397
Rym: But you could, for example, do a hundred meter dash.

455
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:49,704
Scott: Uh, we could.

456
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:51,309
Rym: I'm not saying that should be one.

457
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,699
Rym: I'm just saying it could be some sort of physical thing.

458
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,269
Rym: Like how many fucking pushups can you do?

459
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,373
Scott: You're not doing that.

460
00:22:57,634 --> 00:23:01,489
Scott: Um, it's, it's definitely going to be bored and video game related.

461
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:05,244
Scott: It is not going to be, you know, though there may be dexterity games.

462
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:05,646
Scott: Who knows?

463
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:06,389
Scott: We'll see.

464
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:08,976
Scott: But yeah, sign up and we'll.

465
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:11,385
Scott: March 1st is when I will announce around one.

466
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:14,733
Scott: I've already planned four rounds.

467
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:18,633
Rym: Also, Connecticut panels submissions are not only open, but we are currently scheduling.

468
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:27,554
Rym: So if you want to do something at Connecticut, submit sooner rather than later, good spots are disappearing in our private schedule that we're going to start sharing relatively soon.

469
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:27,917
Scott: Oh yeah.

470
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:28,923
Scott: I should do something about that.

471
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:29,083
Rym: Yeah.

472
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:29,305
Rym: Yeah.

473
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:33,826
Rym: You still need to send me your, the info so I can make your fucking account for the backend.

474
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:34,911
Scott: What's different than you?

475
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:35,995
Scott: What info do you need to know?

476
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,585
Rym: Uh, I sent you an email asking for some stuff.

477
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:39,548
Scott: Okay.

478
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:40,070
Scott: I didn't do it.

479
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:41,457
Scott: What do you not know about me?

480
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:45,936
Rym: I need you to make an account on the regular Connecticut website and send me the username you used.

481
00:23:46,277 --> 00:23:49,087
Rym: Uh, you couldn't, you couldn't manage that.

482
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:54,663
Rym: You couldn't Connecticut websites really bad before you say yes, it is.

483
00:23:55,906 --> 00:23:58,836
Rym: There is, depending on whether or talking absolutely or relative.

484
00:23:58,856 --> 00:23:59,639
Rym: Yes.

485
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:06,339
Rym: Regardless, we're here tonight, 25 minutes into the episode to talk about the great Gatsby.

486
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:07,021
Scott: All right.

487
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,532
Rym: The best thing about this book.

488
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:11,938
Rym: This is the book club one.

489
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,665
Rym: We're not going to summarize the plot.

490
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:15,413
Rym: We assume you've already read it.

491
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,025
Rym: We're just talking about it as though we're a bunch of friends.

492
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:19,290
Rym: We've all read it.

493
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:26,379
Rym: Way to repeat this every time because people don't seem to get it, especially you who insist on summarizing the entire plot of the, of the book.

494
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,463
Scott: Only to piss you off.

495
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:31,839
Rym: The best part about this book is that cover from the first edition.

496
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,907
Rym: That art is one of that art.

497
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:39,404
Rym: is that art is so famous that that art is such a famous and iconic.

498
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:42,536
Scott: I even see that if you go to a Barnes and Noble, they got that shit on the wall.

499
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:45,229
Rym: I kind of want to get a nice poster of this and stick it out.

500
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,877
Scott: It's trivial to do because it's so famous.

501
00:24:46,937 --> 00:24:48,544
Rym: I know it's just it.

502
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:50,594
Rym: The thing is, it's not just this great art.

503
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:55,956
Rym: It actually really well encapsulates kind of the feel of the book and the feel of the era.

504
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,283
Rym: The book was written in and about.

505
00:24:59,086 --> 00:24:59,266
Scott: Yes.

506
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:06,535
Scott: You know, before reading this, I had no idea what it was about other than there was clearly a character named Gatsby who was either great or sarcastically great.

507
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:15,810
Scott: So I had a, and I didn't know that it was about the twenties written in the twenties and they start going in long Island and I'm like, Whoa, I really, I love this.

508
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:16,333
Scott: I don't know.

509
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:20,493
Scott: You know, I wasn't alive in the twenties, but I totally under, you know, New York hasn't changed.

510
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:23,385
Rym: There are things about the thing about this book that haven't changed.

511
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:33,010
Rym: Like there's the scene with when they're driving the cars really fast, like right before the shit goes down in the end and they're going from long Island, like, Oh, let's go to Manhattan.

512
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:38,897
Rym: You know, as they're driving into the city and they like drive through Astoria and then they stop their cars to talk to each other.

513
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:39,118
Rym: Right.

514
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:48,533
Scott: You know where the mechanic is with the sign, the glasses, that's all the mechanic shops out behind Shea state wall, city field, you know, in the Rover there.

515
00:25:48,553 --> 00:25:50,399
Scott: I know exactly where that is.

516
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:57,609
Rym: It was startling almost to read a book like this, not really knowing what to expect because I didn't know a lot about the book 90 years ago.

517
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:05,218
Rym: The geography was pretty similar, but not just the geography, but the culture of like commuters and what different neighborhoods are like.

518
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:12,129
Rym: in some senses, though, in other senses, they changed a lot, but like going to grand central, the scenes written about going to the hotel.

519
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:12,892
Scott: It's still there.

520
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:21,491
Rym: Not only is that hope that hotel is still there, but past the hotel all the time in the summer, that scene could happen today and it would be the exact same scene except everyone has a cell phone.

521
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:22,956
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

522
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:23,358
Rym: Yeah.

523
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:26,328
Scott: So, but they were using regular telephones all the time.

524
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:27,973
Rym: They were, but at the same time, I think.

525
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:35,539
Rym: as a result, I think this book resonated with me a lot more having read it now than it would have had.

526
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:37,267
Rym: I read it as a kid because I was a Michigander.

527
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:42,424
Rym: I'd never been to New York city, let alone New York state until I was like 16 or 17.

528
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:42,705
Rym: Yup.

529
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:50,290
Rym: So I had never like, I had no idea other than from watching Seinfeld, what New York was like being in New York person.

530
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:50,852
Scott: Really?

531
00:26:50,892 --> 00:26:53,923
Scott: This book was like, whoa, I know exactly what's going on here.

532
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:56,573
Rym: And people here are still kind of like that.

533
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,984
Rym: Like this book is pretty relevant.

534
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:01,649
Rym: People are kind of like that.

535
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:12,302
Rym: I, what bothers me about this episode is that this is whether or not you like the characters, whether or not you're not supposed to like any of them.

536
00:27:12,322 --> 00:27:12,969
Scott: None of them are likable.

537
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,056
Rym: I kind of like Gatsby.

538
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:17,085
Scott: I kind of like the main guy a little bit.

539
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:20,782
Scott: I like the main guy because aspects of the main guy, but not other aspects.

540
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:22,630
Rym: Uh, what aspect of the main guy don't you like?

541
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:27,710
Rym: Because what I, what I, when I see about him, why I liked him is that he was in a way kind of like.

542
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:33,218
Rym: he's like the, like he moves here and he's like working like in a, like in financial, he's basically doing the kind of work that I would do.

543
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:33,761
Scott: I liked that.

544
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:34,546
Scott: he was a re.

545
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:38,362
Scott: he's reasonable, you know, not crazy, not stupid person.

546
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:48,038
Scott: He's from a rich family, but he's trying to like, just go on his own and he has the admirable, you know, his main thing is his admirable ability to, you know, forgive and put up with people.

547
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:53,979
Scott: But what I don't like about him is it's like, all right dude, you have basically no balls.

548
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,430
Scott: You're just sort of like, so in the same time where he's putting up with people, he also just takes all shit from people and just isn't see,

549
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,055
Rym: but that was already

550
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:04,460
Scott: shit because he makes

551
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:20,036
Rym: a point pretty early on in the book where he starts talking about that crazy party you went to, you know, the first one where all this other stuff is going on in his life and that the, the events of this book are a tiny percentage of what's actually going on and how

552
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,749
Scott: most of his day is spent doing his bond selling and going to

553
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,777
Rym: dinner, cooking, they just go, whatever.

554
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,593
Rym: But he makes the point that this book is just about that crazy bullshit.

555
00:28:30,196 --> 00:28:35,062
Rym: So it's, I wouldn't really say he doesn't have balls and these people are putting upon him so much as more than he's living his normal life.

556
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:49,085
Rym: It's like if we're living our normal lives and then once every week or so we end up at a party with just crazy people with crazy drama and he's kind of just watching it like, wow, wow.

557
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,652
Scott: So it's just a story of his once a week crazy parties.

558
00:28:51,673 --> 00:28:55,002
Scott: Also, he didn't handle a hot tennis girl very well.

559
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:57,428
Rym: I like her a lot.

560
00:28:57,449 --> 00:29:04,416
Rym: I also, yeah, she's pretty cool because she is, she knows she's cool in the literal, not the literal sense, but in the sense of cool.

561
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:08,930
Rym: She is calculated, sophisticated, calm, nonplussed about everything.

562
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,084
Scott: She's cool and probably way hot that that word is not.

563
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:13,269
Scott: tennis girls are way higher.

564
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:20,273
Rym: Well, she's described as being incredibly attractive and the way she dresses tennis skirts way hot when she's wearing those like riding boots.

565
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:21,817
Rym: That is ace also ace.

566
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:22,137
Scott: Yeah.

567
00:29:22,298 --> 00:29:22,478
Scott: Yeah.

568
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:28,267
Rym: She is, if anything, the only problem with her is that she's too cool for school.

569
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:31,280
Rym: And in fact, our main character really couldn't deal with her.

570
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,888
Rym: And I like how she's.

571
00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:40,227
Rym: a matter of fact, she's like, you know, actually I could've, I could've done a thing with you, but, uh, you didn't really follow up.

572
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:42,174
Scott: So yeah, that's the problem with him.

573
00:29:42,195 --> 00:29:42,757
Scott: Yeah.

574
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:45,089
Rym: But whatever, this was a tiny part of his life.

575
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,016
Rym: At least he made out with her.

576
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:46,439
Scott: Yeah.

577
00:29:49,341 --> 00:29:58,437
Rym: But this is a simple story about a bunch of shitty people doing their shitty thing and a few cool headed people just kind of watching the train wreck.

578
00:29:58,477 --> 00:29:58,617
Scott: Right.

579
00:29:58,878 --> 00:30:01,488
Scott: Well, I mean, what the story, the real car wreck?

580
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:05,021
Scott: in this case, obviously as with any great, you know, work, right?

581
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:10,365
Rym: There are many messages, but the core number one message, I'm curious what you think the number one messages, right?

582
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:13,256
Scott: It's it's the East egg and the West egg.

583
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:21,020
Scott: And it is comparing the old money and the new money, the old money of the East egg and the new money of the West egg.

584
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,632
Scott: You have, you know, Tom and what's her face, right?

585
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:25,876
Scott: Are the old money.

586
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:30,533
Scott: And on the one hand, the old money, it's like, did they really earn their money?

587
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:32,801
Scott: Oh, they kind of inherited it, right?

588
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:37,939
Scott: But they sort of, you know, act at least outwardly, respectively.

589
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:38,200
Scott: Right.

590
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,559
Scott: They sort of have all these airs and ways about them and, you know, things they do.

591
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:42,840
Scott: Right.

592
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,300
Scott: Yep.

593
00:30:43,381 --> 00:30:47,273
Scott: You know, they have a veneer over the reality.

594
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:56,150
Rym: They have the same crazy childish drama that normal people have, but they, but they put it all, they cast it in this completely different light in their, in their personal lives.

595
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,180
Scott: They're sort of shitty and evil, right?

596
00:30:58,561 --> 00:30:59,747
Rym: Not evil, just shitty.

597
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:00,470
Scott: Well, yeah.

598
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,325
Scott: I mean, not super evil, like Hitler evil, but you know, not exactly nice.

599
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:04,728
Scott: Right?

600
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:06,015
Rym: Well, like, yeah, she's cheating on her.

601
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:09,028
Scott: I mean, the dude is mad racist, but he wasn't right.

602
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:12,040
Rym: So he was racist in that really derpy way.

603
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,500
Scott: Right.

604
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:16,034
Scott: But then on the other hand, you have the Gatsby new monies, right?

605
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:19,566
Scott: These people who, you know, how did they earn their money?

606
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,797
Scott: Crime and stealing and not good things.

607
00:31:22,938 --> 00:31:25,367
Rym: But it was, it was relatively cool crime.

608
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:28,177
Rym: I mean, world series and bootlegging.

609
00:31:28,217 --> 00:31:28,759
Scott: Yeah, of course.

610
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:28,980
Scott: Right.

611
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,280
Scott: Yeah.

612
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,527
Scott: He earned his money illegitimately.

613
00:31:31,547 --> 00:31:32,049
Scott: Right.

614
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:42,749
Scott: But, you know, in terms of his ideals and, you know, the way he conducted himself in his personal life was actually, you know, kind of a good standup person.

615
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:49,031
Rym: It's like, if I had to say anything about Gatsby, it's that he was incredibly naive and entirely too genuine.

616
00:31:49,392 --> 00:31:54,930
Scott: It's sort of, in fact mirrors, uh, you're going to love this sanctuary, right?

617
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,488
Scott: You have these people, it's like, you know, these, these two young good guys, these new monies, right.

618
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:06,470
Scott: And, you know, they want to come and fix the government and make the world better and create a sanctuary.

619
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,644
Scott: And they're all idealistic and young and spirited, but how did they get there?

620
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:15,244
Scott: Yuck is a crime in, well, what about those old guys who are already in charge, right?

621
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:16,551
Scott: There's the quote in sanctuary.

622
00:32:16,752 --> 00:32:20,730
Rym: I joined the Yakuza because I can do in a week, what a normal man takes 10 years to accomplish.

623
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,232
Scott: That's right.

624
00:32:21,614 --> 00:32:29,925
Scott: Is, you know, well in sanctuary, at least those guys were Yakuza also, but some, you know, then they were corrupt also, but some of them weren't.

625
00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:38,732
Scott: and they got there, you know, the legit non-crime takes 10 years away, but you know, of course they were up to no good.

626
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:40,559
Scott: Their ideals were not right.

627
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:41,683
Rym: Oh, here's the random aside.

628
00:32:41,703 --> 00:32:45,240
Rym: Apparently Ernest Hemingway hated the cover of the great Gatsby.

629
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:47,065
Scott: Ernest Hemingway hated it.

630
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:47,727
Scott: Okay.

631
00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:56,716
Rym: When Fitzgerald lent him a copy of the great Gatsby that he read, he immediately disliked the cover and Scott told him not to be put off by it.

632
00:32:57,238 --> 00:32:59,611
Rym: And that it had to do with a billboard along the highway in Long Island.

633
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:02,845
Scott: It does have to do with the billboard along the highway in Long Island.

634
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:12,615
Rym: But Gatsby was just, he was too naive and genuine that he, it's like he held onto this pure image of the past.

635
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:18,043
Rym: I'm not going to allude to all the tennis stuff I would reference because no one listening to this episode will get that, but same thing.

636
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:27,073
Rym: We just talked about that, but again, he carried that naive sort of innocence, like he's doing all these things to make right and get with that girl.

637
00:33:27,314 --> 00:33:37,433
Rym: And he has this sort of fairytale idea that if he just gets noticed by her, she's going to leave her husband and get back with him and everything's going to be awesome because her husband's a putz.

638
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:40,327
Rym: How many nice guys do you know who think that exact same thing?

639
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:44,946
Rym: If I'm just around, she's going to ditch that biker asshole and date me in the end.

640
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:52,820
Rym: And she wanted to have an affair with him because she's, you know, she, I think she probably had designs on our main character.

641
00:33:53,983 --> 00:33:55,051
Rym: If that wasn't obvious to all of you.

642
00:33:55,072 --> 00:33:56,080
Scott: But weren't they cousins though?

643
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,081
Rym: Yeah.

644
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,093
Rym: But the way she interacted with him was creepy.

645
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:01,464
Scott: And it was a cousin that she didn't see often until then.

646
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:03,190
Rym: And read it again.

647
00:34:03,331 --> 00:34:05,680
Rym: She flirts with him and it's kind of creepy actually.

648
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,222
Scott: It was pretty creepy.

649
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:06,503
Rym: Yeah.

650
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:10,518
Rym: But so he, she probably wouldn't like seeing Gatsby again.

651
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:12,043
Rym: She was all about having an affair.

652
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:17,400
Rym: But then when he was like, come run away with me for real, let's do this.

653
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,507
Rym: She refused to do it.

654
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:21,576
Rym: She refused to back away completely.

655
00:34:21,596 --> 00:34:26,179
Rym: And she basically just became a passive character and stood there doing nothing until catastrophe happened.

656
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:26,639
Scott: Yep.

657
00:34:27,303 --> 00:34:33,109
Scott: The other thing is I can really relate to this sort of, you know, old money, new money, East egg, West egg contrast.

658
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:39,699
Scott: That is the core of this book because it's something I see, you know, in everyday life, not just in New York, but just sort of everywhere.

659
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:39,980
Scott: Right.

660
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,286
Rym: If anything, it's getting worse.

661
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:41,648
Scott: Yeah.

662
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:50,385
Scott: I mean, look at like, you know, in terms of, you know, internet generation versus not, you know, in terms of thinking on different issues like copyright, it's like old people think this.

663
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:58,999
Scott: new young people think that, you know, and it's just, that's just, you know, young people like the rap music and old people say the rap music is the devil.

664
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:04,338
Scott: And it's all that kind of stuff that we see everywhere in, uh, in our lives every day.

665
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:11,583
Rym: And this book really sort of shows it to you, but it also really hits that aspect of the main characters about our age.

666
00:35:11,703 --> 00:35:14,975
Rym: Like he's going, he's actually similar to us.

667
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:15,938
Rym: He's similar to us.

668
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:22,883
Rym: And especially because the book pointedly avoids the details of his personal life and just shows him interacting with these people.

669
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:38,882
Rym: I find that I actually identify with him to a surprising degree because I picture myself in his situations, reacting in many ways, similarly, not in all ways, because I am much more willing to interject in someone's bullshit.

670
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:39,825
Scott: Yes you are.

671
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:49,338
Scott: But at the other, at the other hand, also the guy who will smile and chuckle and pretend to be paying attention to what some creepy fan boy is saying.

672
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:49,880
Scott: Exactly.

673
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,301
Scott: Right.

674
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:52,651
Scott: Which is what this guy will do, which I do not do.

675
00:35:52,932 --> 00:36:02,485
Rym: But in a way, that's how I also identify with Gatsby because I like Gatsby, but then when I realized that he was really just a naive man-child, I liked him a lot less.

676
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:10,205
Rym: But if his internal drive had matched the surface, he would have been the most awesome dude ever.

677
00:36:10,808 --> 00:36:15,263
Scott: Well, that's why the title of the Great Gatsby is, you know, this title, right?

678
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:26,934
Scott: It's like on the one hand you see the Great Gatsby and in many ways he was not great, which makes it like, oh, the Great Gatsby derp.

679
00:36:27,295 --> 00:36:27,495
Rym: Yep.

680
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:31,133
Rym: Well, he was great except no one went to his funeral because no one even knew who he was.

681
00:36:31,153 --> 00:36:32,160
Rym: They just showed up at his house.

682
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:32,902
Scott: Exactly.

683
00:36:33,203 --> 00:36:38,060
Rym: I mean, at least if I have a party, I know every single person at that party mostly.

684
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,321
Scott: Yeah.

685
00:36:38,381 --> 00:36:49,358
Scott: I mean, I hate it when, you know, like you'll go to like weddings and it's like the people who are getting married don't even know all the people there because like their parents invited somebody and it's like, I will never have that shit ever in my life again.

686
00:36:49,378 --> 00:36:53,640
Scott: It's like, if I, if it is a party for me, I will know every single person there.

687
00:36:54,082 --> 00:37:00,592
Rym: The little touch that the owl looking guy, owl looking guy is the best guy in the whole actually liked Gatsby and was actually missed the funeral.

688
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:03,645
Rym: Like he'd be like, he wanted to go and he just had something come up for real.

689
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:07,281
Rym: The fact that he actually missed Gatsby and actually cared about him.

690
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:10,259
Rym: I thought that was a really nice touch because I remember that character, the whole book.

691
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,263
Scott: That was my favorite guy.

692
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:12,808
Rym: I like the beginning.

693
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:17,485
Rym: I've Scott Fitzgerald guys is one of the better authors in English ever.

694
00:37:18,048 --> 00:37:19,736
Rym: There's a reason why people talk about him.

695
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:21,262
Scott: Well, this is what I think, right?

696
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:22,447
Rym: Well, I want to make a point.

697
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:23,411
Rym: Look at what he did.

698
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:25,560
Rym: The book is titled the great Gatsby.

699
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,404
Rym: We don't meet Gatsby.

700
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:32,360
Scott: If you read on Wikipedia, there was a, he had a hard time picking the title.

701
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,643
Rym: I'm reading the same paragraph.

702
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:35,870
Rym: Those other titles are all stupid.

703
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:36,371
Scott: Yeah.

704
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:40,806
Rym: But anyway, under the red, white and blue, really?

705
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:41,569
Rym: Yeah.

706
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:46,084
Rym: Gold-headed Gatsby, the high bouncing lover Tramocchio in West egg.

707
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:50,676
Scott: Well, actually when I read that Wikipedia, I read what Tramocchio was.

708
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,633
Scott: I forget, but it was once you see what Tramocchio is, you're like, Oh, of course.

709
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:56,556
Scott: Yeah.

710
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:59,026
Rym: Gatsby among Ash heaps and millionaires.

711
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:01,897
Rym: That's, that's the worst title of the bunch.

712
00:38:01,937 --> 00:38:06,316
Scott: So there was apparently some great controversy in our forum about whether this was book was good or not.

713
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,508
Rym: I want to get to everyone who said this book was bad.

714
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:16,590
Rym: If I read between the lines of what you said was bad about it, you didn't, I like the characters.

715
00:38:16,991 --> 00:38:18,796
Rym: You didn't identify with the characters.

716
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:26,303
Rym: You were mad at the decisions the characters made and you couldn't identify with the setting and you couldn't glean the morals and messages.

717
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:34,407
Rym: No one had any criticism of the style, the presentation, you know, the things that literary criticism is about.

718
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:35,410
Scott: Exactly.

719
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:39,304
Scott: So the thing is with this book is that, you know, why is it great?

720
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:40,028
Scott: I'll be honest.

721
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:42,562
Scott: You know, there are many things, you know, it's not a bad book, right?

722
00:38:42,622 --> 00:38:46,519
Scott: But in terms of my personal enjoyment of it, it was slightly above me, right?

723
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:47,322
Scott: I really enjoyed it.

724
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:48,910
Scott: I didn't have a ton of fun reading it.

725
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,975
Scott: It wasn't thrilling.

726
00:38:50,075 --> 00:38:59,425
Scott: I wouldn't like go and read it again, you know, enjoyment wise, but in terms of recognition of quality, it's like, ah, ah, well, right.

727
00:38:59,465 --> 00:39:08,093
Scott: If someone was going to write a textbook with instructions on like how to write good novel, this is like a plus.

728
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:11,886
Rym: Finally, our character goes to the party and he's like, I wonder what's up with the Gatsby.

729
00:39:11,926 --> 00:39:14,098
Rym: Like he's actually like, they set the stage.

730
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:16,328
Rym: You're really wondering like, what's the deal with Gatsby?

731
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,818
Rym: And you get all, first you get all these rumors.

732
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,850
Rym: He hears what other people say about Gatsby and it's all over the place.

733
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:33,080
Rym: And then he goes around and he runs into a few characters in a row where you, as the reader think, I'll bet that's Gatsby.

734
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,667
Rym: You expect it to be Gatsby and it's never Gatsby.

735
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:38,716
Rym: You, everyone thought the guy was Gatsby.

736
00:39:38,757 --> 00:39:44,694
Rym: And then Gatsby talks to him for like five minutes and then he's like, oh, uh, I'm Gatsby.

737
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:45,617
Scott: Yeah.

738
00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:45,998
Scott: Sorry.

739
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,204
Rym: I guess I should have introduced myself.

740
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:53,342
Rym: The way that was executed was brilliant and perfectly constructed.

741
00:39:53,623 --> 00:40:04,227
Rym: If you do not recognize how well that was all put together from a constructive construction standpoint of a novel, you haven't read enough novels and pretty much the whole, everything in the book is like that.

742
00:40:04,307 --> 00:40:08,287
Scott: You know, the, the coincidence of the, the big scene, which is the car accident, right?

743
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:16,679
Scott: And how he, he goes back and forth between the different people and the different cars and the timing of coming back and how they stopped on the way there.

744
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,186
Scott: And the, the timing is getting dark.

745
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:29,347
Rym: Tom is interacting and he pretty much is going to send the crazy, the old sad guy off to murder Gatsby.

746
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:30,812
Rym: Like he, he's going to make that happen.

747
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:34,829
Rym: And he basically starts to get animated with a guy.

748
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:44,650
Rym: And then there's a scene where the cop who's interviewing someone unrelated sort of notices that there's a little bit of commotion and how Tom like tries to back that back off to let his plot happen.

749
00:40:44,671 --> 00:40:45,635
Rym: But it's subtle.

750
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:50,172
Rym: And I think a lot of people miss it, but Tom was premeditating the murder of Gatsby from that point onward.

751
00:40:50,393 --> 00:40:50,553
Rym: Yep.

752
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:56,296
Scott: But anyway, it's just in terms of if someone was going to, you know, it's usually right.

753
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:58,043
Scott: Things that get a lot of attention, right.

754
00:40:58,084 --> 00:41:06,317
Scott: Are things that, you know, don't follow, you know, the textbook, they do something weird or they throw in the twist or they do something clever.

755
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:06,618
Scott: Right.

756
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:08,970
Scott: And it's like, Ooh, look at that clever thing they did in this book.

757
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,603
Scott: Like for example, Hyperion does a clever thing, right?

758
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:13,812
Rym: But this does a lot of clever things too.

759
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,679
Scott: It does, but it does a clever thing.

760
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:16,642
Scott: So it stands out.

761
00:41:17,023 --> 00:41:22,257
Scott: This book is pretty much how to write good novel by the book, right?

762
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:23,661
Scott: Textbook straight down.

763
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,432
Scott: And that's why it's considered like great American novel.

764
00:41:26,472 --> 00:41:28,922
Scott: It doesn't do anything fancy or special.

765
00:41:28,982 --> 00:41:33,539
Scott: It does everything you're supposed to do at an extremely high level of execution.

766
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:41,946
Rym: Now, case in point, the little bit at the end where Tom is confronted with you fucking murdered Gatsby, basically don't pretend you didn't.

767
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:53,561
Rym: And his response, that little scene, and it's not even said explicitly, but what he says translates to, I found that dog dead because no one went to check on it.

768
00:41:54,845 --> 00:42:01,867
Rym: The little subtle bits like that and how that counterbalances the fact that Gatsby was murdered and someone else died.

769
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:06,806
Rym: And yet the fact that the main character knows that Gatsby didn't even do it, that it was Daisy's fault.

770
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:12,604
Rym: It's just, it's also delicately interwoven and brilliant for such a short little book.

771
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:14,151
Rym: It's just perfectly constructed.

772
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:17,386
Rym: It's like a symphony that's just written by the book.

773
00:42:17,446 --> 00:42:18,470
Rym: It's a perfect symphony.

774
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:22,004
Rym: You have no complaint about it, except perhaps that it's not avant-garde.

775
00:42:22,145 --> 00:42:22,365
Rym: Yep.

776
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,416
Scott: But in a way, right, that can actually come out.

777
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:30,097
Scott: kind of boring is, you know, that, that, you know, you did something so plainly, like imagine a bat.

778
00:42:30,137 --> 00:42:33,412
Rym: Well, in the same way that Citizen Kane seems really boring to most people.

779
00:42:33,472 --> 00:42:40,841
Scott: Imagine if you had a basketball game and you won by a zillion points because you played so well, but all you did was just take shots and make layups.

780
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:45,176
Scott: No fancy dunks, no fancy trick plays or behind the back passes.

781
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:47,985
Scott: Just, you know, take it the whole layup every time.

782
00:42:48,005 --> 00:42:55,009
Rym: The most boring football game is run, pass, run, march up the field, touchdown, run, pass, run, march up the field.

783
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:58,239
Scott: No Hail Marys, no onside kicks.

784
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:02,799
Rym: You want to see the onside kick, the two-point conversion, but there's nothing fancy going on here.

785
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:07,521
Scott: It's straightforward, but it scores a zillion points and runs up the score and the opponent's got nothing.

786
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:16,787
Rym: But meanwhile, our listeners had none of this umbrage with the King Killer Chronicle, both sexy Rops through the world.

787
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:18,691
Rym: That's the XFL.

788
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:24,144
Rym: You're going to tell me that you prefer the XFL because it's so exciting.

789
00:43:24,164 --> 00:43:28,620
Scott: No, it's because, you know, like I, I keep bringing this argument up.

790
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,295
Scott: It's the same thing we've been discussing since the beginning of internets.

791
00:43:32,557 --> 00:43:38,860
Scott: And, you know, time really is that most people, they read, they have a piece of entertainment media.

792
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:42,374
Scott: They have a feeling, a reaction to it as all people do.

793
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:48,236
Scott: If that feeling is positive, they rate it as good and they like it or their favorite or whatever.

794
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:52,555
Scott: And if they get a bad feeling from it personally, they say, that's not to my taste.

795
00:43:52,615 --> 00:43:53,198
Scott: I don't like it.

796
00:43:53,278 --> 00:43:53,700
Scott: It's bad.

797
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:54,424
Scott: And that's there.

798
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,537
Scott: That's the limit of their critique abilities.

799
00:43:56,798 --> 00:43:59,029
Scott: I, you know, I think it's more subtle than that.

800
00:43:59,049 --> 00:43:59,994
Rym: I think it's more specific.

801
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:08,566
Rym: I think there's a very, very specific problem that I see among, not to stereotype, but younger people who happen to be our listeners or nerdy like this.

802
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,039
Rym: You don't identify with a character or a setting.

803
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:16,414
Rym: And therefore you somehow translate that into saying the work is bad.

804
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:18,260
Scott: I don't identify.

805
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:18,964
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

806
00:44:18,984 --> 00:44:20,496
Scott: is they had a negative feeling towards it.

807
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:23,313
Scott: And like I said, my feelings toward it, weren't extremely positive.

808
00:44:23,354 --> 00:44:24,380
Scott: They're only slightly positive.

809
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,313
Rym: I cannot identify with the in the Prince of nothing.

810
00:44:27,413 --> 00:44:31,771
Rym: I'm not a fat old sad wizard, but I can still recognize the work.

811
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:33,256
Scott: as look at this craftsmanship.

812
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:34,240
Scott: It's a miracle.

813
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:37,691
Rym: It's like all things considered, but you know what?

814
00:44:38,173 --> 00:44:41,908
Rym: I don't identify with Katniss, a teenage girl with teenage girl thoughts.

815
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:49,922
Rym: But when you tell me it's a bad book, because you can't identify with the teenage girl, because you're a 30 year old dude, that's not a criticism of the work.

816
00:44:49,942 --> 00:44:53,996
Rym: That's a criticism of you as a person who would enjoy that work.

817
00:44:54,197 --> 00:44:54,457
Scott: Yeah.

818
00:44:54,738 --> 00:45:01,446
Scott: It's like, yeah, it's not for you, but you should still be able to recognize whether it's good or bad, regardless of whether it's for you or not.

819
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:09,935
Scott: I mean, see, you know, uh, Reagan C spot run isn't for me, but I can tell whether it's a good kids book or not by reading it and checking it out.

820
00:45:09,955 --> 00:45:19,879
Scott: Uh, I mean, I can go to the museum and I can look at a statue and I can, you know, I don't know that much about sculpture, but I know a little, and I can tell, oh, look at how well this was crafted.

821
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:25,658
Scott: This was made by a freaking Greek dude centuries ago with a chisel and a hammer and only shit.

822
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:27,466
Scott: It looks like fucking real person.

823
00:45:27,747 --> 00:45:29,053
Scott: That is fucking unbelievable.

824
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:29,254
Scott: What?

825
00:45:29,274 --> 00:45:30,278
Scott: I want to put it in my house.

826
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:35,778
Scott: No, I don't really like it, but I can recognize the, basically the miracle of craftsmanship.

827
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,102
Scott: And that is what this book is.

828
00:45:37,122 --> 00:45:49,308
Rym: Uh, like remember when he goes, uh, the main character goes home for me to hang out with his family for a little bit, that whole description of like the train ride and every description of everything is, is off the chart.

829
00:45:49,809 --> 00:46:16,825
Rym: It's just, and I think the reason this book has endured so well and is remembered separately and above other works that describe a similar time in a similar place or have similar motifs or similar sort of morals and themes is that this one in particular really spoke to this sort of generation of 25 to 35 year olds from major cities or who have lived in major cities.

830
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,900
Rym: It also really spoke to a generation coming out of world war one.

831
00:46:22,142 --> 00:46:27,709
Rym: And I think that just kind of cemented it in American culture, but also the fact that it really is timeless piece.

832
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:32,091
Rym: I mean, I live in the place where this book supposedly takes place, like parts of it.

833
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:33,920
Rym: I mean, long islands, not too far away.

834
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:38,657
Rym: They drove right through where Scott and I live and it's still like that here.

835
00:46:38,717 --> 00:46:53,228
Rym: Like I can see those places and I can see people who are just like these characters, people commuting on the exact same mistakes in their real life.

836
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:54,533
Rym: They're only different.

837
00:46:55,015 --> 00:47:02,711
Rym: I think a lot of people are making these mistakes that might be made uncomfortable by the book because they don't recognize that because the, you know, the book is kind of saying whenever

838
00:47:02,772 --> 00:47:07,619
Scott: a book has something to say to a person and that person is reading the book, that person never recognized that it's them.

839
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:12,612
Rym: How many fedora fedora wearing brony?

840
00:47:12,632 --> 00:47:16,362
Rym: nice guys don't realize that they're just a sad sack version of Gatsby.

841
00:47:16,523 --> 00:47:16,763
Scott: Yeah.

842
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:21,257
Rym: I mean, literally you are a sad sack version of Gatsby.

843
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:25,430
Rym: If you're that fedora, nice guy, because Gatsby is the fedora nice guy.

844
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,440
Rym: The fedora is his mansion, his affectations.

845
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:37,252
Rym: The nice guy is just his weird unrealistic expectations about this girl and her relationship with him and her relationship with the people around her.

846
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:38,960
Rym: She's dating that biker asshole.

847
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,710
Rym: And that biker assholes racism is.

848
00:47:44,232 --> 00:47:48,405
Rym: there are people like that today who are exactly the same kind of racist.

849
00:47:48,545 --> 00:47:49,690
Rym: Like that is not changed.

850
00:47:50,011 --> 00:47:50,895
Rym: I know people like that.

851
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:53,385
Scott: You want to hear a funny racist story from today?

852
00:47:54,229 --> 00:47:56,016
Scott: What is one of those guys outside my work?

853
00:47:56,057 --> 00:47:57,843
Scott: He's trying to, you know, give CDs out.

854
00:47:58,284 --> 00:47:58,545
Rym: Right.

855
00:47:58,685 --> 00:47:59,227
Rym: The typical.

856
00:47:59,468 --> 00:47:59,769
Scott: Right.

857
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,237
Scott: And he himself is a black person.

858
00:48:02,397 --> 00:48:02,618
Scott: Right.

859
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:08,987
Scott: And he's obviously trying to get tourists to, to trap them and give him money in exchange for his bad rap CD that you do that he made.

860
00:48:09,008 --> 00:48:13,305
Scott: And he calls out to this one tourist and he's like, Hey man, where are you from?

861
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:15,677
Scott: And the guy was a tourist, so he couldn't resist.

862
00:48:15,757 --> 00:48:16,802
Scott: And he said, Norway.

863
00:48:17,284 --> 00:48:19,593
Scott: So the guy says they got Negroes in Norway.

864
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:21,320
Scott: That's the end of the story.

865
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:23,702
Scott: Wow.

866
00:48:23,722 --> 00:48:23,862
Scott: Yeah.

867
00:48:24,043 --> 00:48:24,584
Rym: That's great.

868
00:48:24,805 --> 00:48:24,965
Scott: Yep.

869
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:27,392
Rym: There's people like that.

870
00:48:27,412 --> 00:48:27,813
Rym: Yep.

871
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:30,159
Rym: So I don't know.

872
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:38,073
Rym: Well, I mean, not to get into a deep, literally literary analysis of the themes and maybe I could summarize the plot for you, but I don't know.

873
00:48:38,093 --> 00:48:39,198
Rym: The book really spoke to me.

874
00:48:39,258 --> 00:48:50,099
Rym: It did get, I think it really speaks to, you know, people in their late twenties, early thirties who have gone beyond the point where they can do anything to having to pick something and actually do it.

875
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:53,232
Rym: And there's a little bit of ennui there.

876
00:48:53,313 --> 00:49:00,705
Rym: I don't think we're at the point of, it's not that the, you know, a lot of people say this is the book about like the American dream collapsing in that era.

877
00:49:00,725 --> 00:49:04,784
Scott: There's clearly the ennui of like, Hey, you know, we should probably hang out and do something.

878
00:49:04,804 --> 00:49:05,528
Scott: What do you want to do?

879
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:05,870
Scott: I don't know.

880
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:07,580
Scott: Let's go to the hotel and get drunk.

881
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,041
Scott: All right.

882
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:11,154
Scott: Maybe you should put on some music and dance.

883
00:49:11,194 --> 00:49:12,620
Scott: No one really knows what the fuck to do.

884
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:17,697
Scott: Or board games or anything, but we do the same thing today.

885
00:49:17,717 --> 00:49:20,636
Scott: It's like, Hey, let's go to Manhattan and do, we should go to Manhattan and do something.

886
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:20,978
Scott: Okay.

887
00:49:20,998 --> 00:49:21,882
Scott: What should we do?

888
00:49:22,444 --> 00:49:22,645
Rym: Yeah.

889
00:49:22,905 --> 00:49:32,462
Rym: I mean that drama of they're all in the uncomfortable situation toward the end and they all decide to go to the hotel and the girl basically, uh, Tom's like, wait, why are we going to the city?

890
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:34,834
Rym: And Daisy's like, yeah, let's go into the city.

891
00:49:34,974 --> 00:49:35,698
Rym: He's like, fine.

892
00:49:35,758 --> 00:49:38,710
Rym: And he does all the bullshit to organize them going into the city.

893
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:42,464
Rym: And then at the end of all that, when she's like, well, there's your idea anyway.

894
00:49:42,484 --> 00:49:45,633
Rym: And his reaction to that, I have lived that.

895
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:48,662
Rym: I have lived that exact reality.

896
00:49:48,742 --> 00:49:51,229
Rym: In fact, Scott, you and I have been in situations like that.

897
00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:59,698
Scott: There is an unstated drama, not a hundred years after this book is written the same thing is still going on.

898
00:49:59,718 --> 00:50:01,285
Rym: In fact, I recall a specific time.

899
00:50:01,325 --> 00:50:05,927
Rym: We all ended up at a restaurant, a whole bunch of us with a person that would be a source of drama.

900
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:07,033
Rym: Everyone's uncomfortable.

901
00:50:07,114 --> 00:50:07,777
Rym: No one will account.

902
00:50:07,998 --> 00:50:08,882
Rym: We'll do it directly.

903
00:50:09,403 --> 00:50:22,840
Rym: One of our friends got speed and we lived through everything but the death, including the drive home, the separate cars, who goes in what car, the two people who aren't dating.

904
00:50:24,002 --> 00:50:24,585
Rym: Oh my God.

905
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:37,975
Rym: Uh, I won't name names on the show because some of these people might listen, but we know two people who each were dating other people who ended up with each other later, who had that situation of they rode in the car together, home from the thing.

906
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:41,185
Rym: This book is a hundred years after the book.

907
00:50:41,225 --> 00:50:44,636
Rym: It's exactly what happens in American relationships today.

908
00:50:44,656 --> 00:50:45,117
Scott: Yep.

909
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:51,501
Rym: So if you can't identify with this book, read it again when you turn 29 and you still can't identify with it.

910
00:50:51,521 --> 00:50:54,893
Scott: Move to a city and stop being a provincial stick liver.

911
00:50:54,913 --> 00:51:02,799
Rym: I defy anyone to live in a major city like New York, hit the age of 35 and not be able to identify with this book.

912
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:04,385
Scott: And not be, you can't be a shut-in either.

913
00:51:04,445 --> 00:51:05,530
Scott: Shut-in won't understand it.

914
00:51:06,012 --> 00:51:08,344
Scott: It's hard to have some social life to understand.

915
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:10,476
Rym: It is hard to move to New York and still be a shut-in.

916
00:51:10,496 --> 00:51:11,260
Scott: There are shut-ins here.

917
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,485
Scott: They get delivery for everything.

918
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:17,164
Rym: Ah, but then you have to be independently wealthy or have a sugar daddy.

919
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:19,652
Rym: In which case, but you still feel to afford rent.

920
00:51:19,692 --> 00:51:20,434
Scott: Telecommute living.

921
00:51:21,738 --> 00:51:23,084
Rym: But then you're not living in the city.

922
00:51:23,466 --> 00:51:25,114
Scott: No, they telecommute and they live in the city.

923
00:51:25,435 --> 00:51:26,641
Rym: Where do they live in the city then?

924
00:51:26,963 --> 00:51:27,747
Scott: In some shitty apartment.

925
00:51:28,068 --> 00:51:31,749
Rym: Yeah, some shitty apartment, probably far enough away to where they're not going to be interacting with all this.

926
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:33,440
Scott: Yeah, they're not long island taking the train.

927
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:45,449
Rym: It's a rare person who is going to be able to live in a city, be 35 and not realize how directly relevant everything that happens in this book is to real life.

928
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:49,700
Rym: I don't know what else I have to say.

929
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,215
Scott: I mean, I know there's a whole bunch of symbolism you can talk about.

930
00:51:52,256 --> 00:51:56,153
Scott: Like if you were going to give an exam on this book, you would talk about like, what's the green light?

931
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:57,941
Rym: Why does it symbolize what it does?

932
00:51:57,961 --> 00:51:59,125
Scott: You're talking about the green light.

933
00:51:59,146 --> 00:52:01,515
Rym: The unattainable dream versus the reality.

934
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:07,937
Rym: His desire for her was only pure when she was an unattainable thing in the distance.

935
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:10,085
Rym: The reality actually destroyed the dream.

936
00:52:10,246 --> 00:52:17,657
Scott: Or you can talk about the eyeglasses on the billboard across from the mechanic shop being like the eyes of God and watching everybody.

937
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:18,942
Rym: If we wrote The Great Gatsby today.

938
00:52:18,962 --> 00:52:23,739
Scott: And how the owl-eyed guy matches with the owl-eyed doctor optician poster.

939
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:27,268
Rym: Scott, if we wrote this book today, you know what those eyes are?

940
00:52:27,288 --> 00:52:27,328
Rym: Dr.

941
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:29,093
Rym: Zizemore.

942
00:52:29,554 --> 00:52:29,795
Scott: It's Dr.

943
00:52:29,815 --> 00:52:30,196
Scott: Zizemore.

944
00:52:30,216 --> 00:52:33,083
Scott: That would be skin and not eyes.

945
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:41,855
Rym: That is the thing I would use if I was writing The Great Gatsby today as something that if you live in New York, it's like, yeah, everyone knows.

946
00:52:41,976 --> 00:52:44,966
Scott: But I think this is a made up optician and not a real one.

947
00:52:44,987 --> 00:52:47,514
Rym: But you need that kind of detail.

948
00:52:47,815 --> 00:52:54,700
Rym: Because when I read this book and he described that, I can picture a thing like that because there are things like that.

949
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,868
Rym: People who live here know those things.

950
00:52:57,129 --> 00:52:58,716
Rym: The thing doesn't actually need to exist.

951
00:52:58,756 --> 00:53:01,146
Rym: The idea of that kind of thing needs to exist.

952
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:08,513
Scott: But I mean, and I can totally get that feel of, you know, the feeling of billboard sort of watching, even if it doesn't have eyes at work.

953
00:53:08,754 --> 00:53:09,657
Scott: I'm in Times Square.

954
00:53:09,677 --> 00:53:11,143
Scott: I'm on the seventh floor.

955
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:13,113
Scott: It's friggin billboards right outside the window.

956
00:53:13,133 --> 00:53:17,170
Scott: And it's like, when you sit near one of those windows, it's like friggin.

957
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:20,222
Scott: whatever's out there is like upon you all the time.

958
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,146
Scott: You know, so it's like.

959
00:53:21,186 --> 00:53:26,671
Scott: I bet this mechanic looking out his window was a lot like me looking out the window at work on my desk was in the other position.

960
00:53:27,174 --> 00:53:38,100
Scott: You know, seeing that billboard sort of imposing on your space all the time, you know, sort of watching him and the way he treated his, you know, wife, I guess technically wife, right, and all the things that went on there.

961
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,609
Scott: And anyone who came across, you know, but yeah.

962
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,401
Scott: All right, do you have anything else to say about this book?

963
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:46,504
Rym: No, so what's the next book?

964
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:47,828
Scott: What is the next book?

965
00:53:47,868 --> 00:53:49,192
Scott: So here we go.

966
00:53:50,696 --> 00:54:03,084
Scott: Usually and recently I had a policy of pick a book that I own that is on my shelf that I have not read so that I can read it and get it and eventually have read all the books that are already on my shelf and not buy any new books made of paper.

967
00:54:03,225 --> 00:54:04,208
Rym: So did you do just that?

968
00:54:04,228 --> 00:54:04,248
Rym: I

969
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:11,409
Scott: was about to do just that and then I had selected a book from the shelf that I had not read yet,

970
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:12,532
Rym: but

971
00:54:12,973 --> 00:54:21,433
Scott: I discovered the existence of a previously unknown to me book that is such a I swear

972
00:54:21,453 --> 00:54:25,261
Rym: to god if you say some book that everyone's read

973
00:54:25,401 --> 00:54:28,309
Scott: now that is such a GeekNights' book.

974
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:31,538
Scott: there could not be a more GeekNights.

975
00:54:31,578 --> 00:54:32,420
Scott: scott rubin book.

976
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,525
Scott: i've only started reading it.

977
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:35,674
Scott: i'm like in the second very early on.

978
00:54:35,735 --> 00:54:38,564
Scott: my kindle is only less than 20. so far nothing.

979
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:39,165
Scott: no.

980
00:54:40,048 --> 00:54:43,055
Scott: uh it might even be more GeekNights than prince of nothing.

981
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:49,253
Scott: huh i haven't finished it i don't know yet but here you you're gonna you know okay.

982
00:54:49,274 --> 00:54:54,449
Scott: so anyway i was told of a series of books uh by our friend alex.

983
00:54:54,489 --> 00:54:54,931
Scott: do you know this?

984
00:54:54,951 --> 00:54:55,131
Scott: yet?

985
00:54:55,151 --> 00:55:01,611
Scott: uh we mentioned it maybe the last book club a little bit or maybe in a recent episode i forget.

986
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:11,761
Scott: there is a series of books written by a person named ian m banks about a thing called the culture which is apparently i don't know too much about it.

987
00:55:11,781 --> 00:55:15,090
Scott: uh because i'm only partially through one book.

988
00:55:15,992 --> 00:55:22,791
Scott: uh that is some sort of far futuristic utopia of awesomeness and high technology.

989
00:55:22,811 --> 00:55:26,623
Scott: that is exactly the kind of place we would want to live to be awesome for us.

990
00:55:28,087 --> 00:55:34,547
Scott: and the second book in this series we're skipping over the first book which is called flavors.

991
00:55:34,587 --> 00:55:36,433
Scott: consider i forget what it's called something like that.

992
00:55:36,835 --> 00:55:50,860
Scott: the second book in this series which i've been told you can read without having read the first one is called player of games and it is about a guy who is pretty much the best game player there is in this utopian society.

993
00:55:52,540 --> 00:56:01,215
Rym: and according to the small the text on the back of the book i could search through my email and find how many listeners have emailed me to say wait i should read this book over the last.

994
00:56:01,296 --> 00:56:12,078
Scott: yeah according to the back of the book it's about how he supposedly gets entangled into some civilization where you play games to become the emperor or something like that.

995
00:56:12,158 --> 00:56:19,503
Scott: so i could not imagine just based on that summary alone and the partial bits i the beginning that i've read so far.

996
00:56:19,523 --> 00:56:30,618
Scott: this is like someone wrote this book thinking like oh let me write a book for Rym and Scott here those those nerdy cyberpunk progressive utopian game player guys.

997
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:32,825
Scott: let's write a book for them and that is this book.

998
00:56:33,207 --> 00:56:35,635
Rym: so no benjuka there's.

999
00:56:36,116 --> 00:56:37,822
Scott: they play other games besides benjuka.

1000
00:56:37,842 --> 00:56:41,817
Scott: that might as well be fucking benjuka already been like three or four of them.

1001
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:45,608
Scott: um yeah so that is the book club book.

1002
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:48,797
Scott: it is player of games by ian m banks.

1003
00:56:48,857 --> 00:56:50,642
Scott: you can just get it almost anywhere.

1004
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:53,089
Scott: it is the second book in the culture series.

1005
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:57,102
Scott: so if you want emily is very excited about this book.

1006
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,011
Rym: if you want to read it you can.

1007
00:56:59,051 --> 00:57:01,381
Scott: maybe you can read the first culture series book if you want.

1008
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:13,546
Scott: i'm probably gonna go back and read that too because i can't because the the only thing i tell you so far is that not having read the first book in the culture series i'm not sure how much i'm supposed to know about the culture.

1009
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:18,021
Scott: a lot of it you can just pick up on as you go along but it's like.

1010
00:57:18,443 --> 00:57:18,644
Scott: you know.

1011
00:57:18,684 --> 00:57:20,291
Scott: they just sort of have an.

1012
00:57:20,352 --> 00:57:22,963
Scott: it's sort of like reading a marvel comic not knowing the marvel universe.

1013
00:57:23,204 --> 00:57:25,452
Scott: right it's like yeah okay who's you know?

1014
00:57:25,553 --> 00:57:27,058
Scott: daredevil he's a lawyer.

1015
00:57:27,099 --> 00:57:28,383
Scott: i didn't know that you know.

1016
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,791
Scott: and it's like oh the culture there's.

1017
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:36,995
Scott: no you know there's a thing called contact that finds alien civilizations and it's sort of secret and awesome.

1018
00:57:37,076 --> 00:57:39,968
Scott: okay i didn't know that you know but you pick up on it anyway.

1019
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:41,776
Scott: that's the book all right.

1020
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,803
Scott: then i will go back to my other policy.

1021
00:57:44,064 --> 00:57:50,604
Rym: watch our watch our videos read the book join the forum join scott's grand prix join the grand prix.

1022
00:57:50,644 --> 00:57:53,759
Scott: if you have balls or want to measure them come see us at pax.

1023
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:55,701
Scott: that's it.

1024
00:58:01,266 --> 00:58:03,508
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1025
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:08,721
Rym: special thanks to dj pretzel for the opening cat lee for web design and brando k for the logos.
