00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,691
Rym: It's Monday, October 7th, 2013.

2
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:13,233
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:13,955
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:16,079
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,660
Rym: Cooling small rooms filled with servers.

6
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:21,320
Scott: Answer, wait till winter.

7
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:23,298
Rym: Actually it's worse than winter.

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,938
Rym: Let's do this.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,800
Rym: So I'm starting to realize something when it comes to this consumer level media equipment.

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:39,787
Rym: Because remember when podcasting got really big in like 2005?

11
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:41,199
Scott: When the iPod Nano came out.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,294
Scott: And they added podcasts to iTunes.

13
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,080
Scott: That's when it got big.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,260
Rym: But then there were all these consumer level mixers started appearing.

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,460
Rym: But they at least had mostly the trappings of real mixers.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,120
Rym: Like they had the same kinds of features, just much cheaper and not as well put together.

17
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:57,777
Rym: But they were there.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,319
Rym: But there were also those sort of podcasting appliances and podcasts for USB.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,123
Scott: There were a lot of podcasts.

20
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:06,500
Scott: It was mostly a lot of things like, what was that company?

21
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:07,764
Scott: M-Audio.

22
00:01:07,824 --> 00:01:09,609
Scott: They just made these interfaces.

23
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:13,500
Scott: It was like, plug an XLR microphone into this interface and into your computer with a USB.

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,866
Scott: Or, here's a microphone.

25
00:01:15,886 --> 00:01:20,560
Scott: that's a big fancy microphone that's good for podcasting, but is just USB microphone.

26
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:21,799
Scott: You plug it into your computer and talk.

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,800
Rym: But basically, because I knew audio, I kind of ignored all that stuff and used real equipment from the beginning.

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,820
Rym: And I know Scott knows a lot about computer audio as it pertains to surround sound and receivers and making all that work.

29
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:37,039
Scott: He has talked about it.

30
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,120
Scott: It's home theater knowledges, mostly.

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,240
Rym: But also the computer side of it.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,700
Scott: But I know how to get a PC into a home theater, yes.

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,360
Rym: And then I know the production, routing, mixers, aux whatevers, insert, TRS.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,760
Scott: If you want me to set up your home theater in the most perfect way, I can do it as good as anyone on Earth can do it with any equipment.

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,300
Scott: As long as you have the right shit and the right cables for mono price, I will charge, I don't know, a lot for that service.

36
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:02,820
Rym: An unreasonable amount.

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,199
Scott: Yeah, and you have to pay to get me to your house.

38
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:12,539
Rym: But I've noticed something because Scott and I both bought the Elgato, which is this little device that you plug it into USB.

39
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,899
Rym: I bought it for $10 more than you paid at PAX.

40
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,260
Rym: No, actually $10 because it was still on sale on Amazon.

41
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:24,880
Rym: It was cheaper on Amazon when I bought it than it was when you looked it up from the floor at PAX.

42
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:27,860
Rym: But it was still more expensive than what you paid on the floor at PAX.

43
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,300
Rym: And I did not get the free T-shirt and poster that you gave away to that kid.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,260
Scott: That I did not need filling up my house into my garbage can.

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,700
Rym: You gave one away to the kid and then the kid was a greedy little shit and wanted the other one too, so you gave it to his friend.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,300
Rym: But anyway, Elgato works pretty well, but then we got this rig as well, which is a headset that we'll talk about later.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,279
Rym: And looking at how both of these things work, I realized something kind of profound that should have been obvious, but I hadn't really thought about it until just now.

48
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,560
Rym: Most people, because now there's a big push, kind of like how podcasts had this push, streaming video games seems to be the thing now.

49
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:03,937
Scott: Well, Twitch.

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,800
Scott: It's been the thing for a while.

51
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,060
Rym: But it's starting to ramp up in that people who weren't doing it before are starting to do it.

52
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:13,720
Rym: Yeah, exactly, and there's a lot of interest in it.

53
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,140
Scott: As soon as you do it, then it's a trend, you trendsetter you.

54
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:16,654
Scott: No, no.

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,720
Scott: It wasn't a trend already and you're bandwagoning.

56
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,140
Scott: You're not, you're always leading the bandwagon, you're not getting on the bandwagon.

57
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,060
Rym: I'm definitely on the trailing edge of this bandwagon.

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,380
Scott: You are soundly in the middle of the bandwagon.

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,860
Rym: Middle, I'm on the back end of it.

60
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,340
Scott: Four wheels are surrounding your butt.

61
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,120
Rym: I'm not saying on the trendsetter, I'm saying the opposite.

62
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,339
Rym: I'm saying this trend was going and it's starting to get bigger, and what's happened...

63
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,479
Scott: Too many people in the wagon with you now, hipster.

64
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:39,926
Scott: Nah.

65
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:40,579
Scott: Gotta get out.

66
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:47,700
Rym: My problem is this, the technology that people are using to do this stuff is by and large

67
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:48,843
Scott: pretty

68
00:03:48,983 --> 00:04:09,900
Rym: poorly designed with terrible use cases, and it's almost like people who are into gaming wanted things to support their gaming streaming, but don't know the right way to do any of these things and solve the problems as they perceive them rather than doing what, I don't know, real video and audio professionals have been doing for decades.

69
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:23,340
Scott: Right, well it's like, look, most people use OBS, which is Open Broadcaster Software, which is this free open source thing that basically you run it, it looks at your screen, right, takes those images, encodes them, and streams them.

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,299
Scott: That's what it does.

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,719
Scott: And XSplit does a similar thing, but XSplit costs money.

72
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:31,160
Scott: OBS is free, open source, whatever.

73
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,140
Scott: But it's kind of buggy, sometimes it doesn't work.

74
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,319
Scott: Sometimes XSplit is buggy and crashes, right?

75
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:40,260
Scott: And that seems to be the method the vast majority of people use for streaming.

76
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:51,516
Scott: When people, and people really mostly only stream PC games or emulated games on their PC using this method, and there's really no other method available to 99% of people.

77
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,099
Scott: I mean, friggin' even SaltyBet uses this kind of thing.

78
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:03,059
Rym: Like here's my example, the Elgato has HDMI in, HDMI out, so you put it in stream, and then like in your video stream.

79
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:16,340
Scott: Elgato is the only way that somebody, the only way I know of, consumer product wise, that someone can stream their Xbox or PS3 or Wii or something like that directly without having fancy equipment that they won't have.

80
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,560
Scott: It's like the affordable, consumer-friendly solution to that problem, which is why I have it.

81
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:29,220
Rym: But the kinds of issues it has, like it just doesn't recognize all the interfaces on professional audio equipment, so you have to use ghetto audio equipment with it.

82
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,079
Scott: Well that's the problem in the software, actually.

83
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:40,700
Rym: Exactly, because the kinds of people who are using these things by and large don't know a lot about this stuff, and it's really geared toward them.

84
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:43,380
Rym: And if you have a complex use case, that has a lot of issues.

85
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,220
Rym: And also, basic stuff, like if you unplug it, it just stops displaying your stream.

86
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:50,107
Rym: Like it blocks your TV.

87
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,160
Rym: Not even just the local device, it also blocks the TV itself.

88
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:06,731
Rym: But it's the same way with the rig, this headset, because as Scott pointed out, it has two interfaces, a USB interface, and then an eighth-inch stereo interface, so it can receive audio from two sources, and send audio from one.

89
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:21,115
Scott: Right, the whole point of that is so that you can go into the Skype options, or the Ventrilo options, or the TeamSpeak options, and say, "Hey, you take your microphone input from USB, and your audio output to

90
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:21,235
Scott: USB.".

91
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:27,737
Scott: And then you go to the game you're playing, and you say, "Hey game, send your audio output of this game to the

92
00:06:27,777 --> 00:06:28,160
Scott: speakers.".

93
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:41,580
Scott: That way, you could use the hardware slider on the rig to basically make your friends on Skype louder, or TeamSpeak louder, and the game quieter, or vice versa, and sort of mix between the two, and that's why there's two interfaces.

94
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,660
Rym: But why the eighth-inch stereo to plug into your other sound card?

95
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,360
Rym: Why isn't it just one USB with two interfaces in it?

96
00:06:49,780 --> 00:07:06,500
Scott: Because that would cost more, and then the mixer wouldn't be this sort of, you know, that mixer that they're using is probably a cheap analog thing inside that hockey puck, whereas if it was two interfaces, that mixing would have to happen digitally, which means there would have to be more processing power in the rig itself to do that.

97
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:18,540
Rym: But also, looking at the way it interfaces with Xboxes, with these pass-throughs and things, the kinds of cables that it wants you to connect to things really just make it look kind of pathetic next to any real equipment.

98
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:19,260
Scott: Of course.

99
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:21,479
Rym: So I've been having this issue lately.

100
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,100
Scott: Buy real equipment.

101
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:32,720
Rym: Yeah, but at the high end, a lot of the higher-end equipment, the software in games just doesn't deal with it well.

102
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:33,359
Scott: Of course not.

103
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:41,614
Rym: Try to use a FireWire interface 8 out of 17 as your microphone input for a game, and a lot of games will be like,

104
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:41,919
Rym: "What?".

105
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:50,039
Scott: And now you know this is even the most basic thing that people go through when they set up those booths at conventions that have all those game systems, right?

106
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,239
Scott: Think about the people that have the giant video screens or the video walls or the multi-monitor setups.

107
00:07:57,022 --> 00:08:04,100
Scott: Every booth you've seen at PAX where tons of crazy computers set up in all these weird ways, playing demos, it's crazy.

108
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,719
Scott: And then they have little servers for the LAN inside the little booth.

109
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:13,180
Scott: This is the entry level of the kind of problems those people face.

110
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,421
Scott: But it's

111
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:26,239
Rym: one of those things where a lot of the people who try to do audio production or podcasts or a little studio, they set up their mixers and everything, and I was looking at forums for both the rig and the Elgato to answer some questions, because the documentation is kind of sparse.

112
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:30,300
Rym: And I saw the kinds of questions the average users of these are asking.

113
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,039
Scott: They have no clue of anything that's going on.

114
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:35,039
Rym: And it really makes it clear why the software is the way it is.

115
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:49,980
Rym: But I see a lot of people, they'll rig up all these cables plugged in all over the place to do some sort of audio thing that could have been done entirely in their software they already have if they just knew to right-click on the mixer in Windows.

116
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:51,408
Scott: Yep.

117
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:52,500
Scott: People don't know how to use that shit.

118
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:52,880
Rym: Yep.

119
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,572
Rym: Which has been a theme in GeekNights since about 2002, 20 out of five.

120
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,708
Rym: So you got any news?

121
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,820
Rym: It's a Monday.

122
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:02,820
Scott: Why don't we talk about-- It's not the lounge.

123
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,860
Scott: Yeah, why don't we talk about Adobe losing all their passwords and shit.

124
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,744
Rym: Oh, Adobe.

125
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:08,575
Rym: Usually I make fun of this.

126
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:09,500
Rym: We both make fun of this.

127
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:12,694
Scott: This happens a lot, and it never happens to anywhere.

128
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:13,900
Scott: I have a username and password.

129
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:17,959
Rym: So now it happened to something we use, and our friend Conrad pointed this out.

130
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:24,200
Rym: The reason this one sucks in particular is because it's not like there's another option.

131
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,659
Rym: It's not like there's another company that makes software like this.

132
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,580
Rym: Like what am I going to do if I don't like the fact that they have kind of bad security?

133
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:34,791
Rym: Stop doing things?

134
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:36,300
Rym: Stop doing my job?

135
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:37,343
Scott: Yeah.

136
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:39,840
Scott: You're sort of stuck with Adobe no matter what.

137
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,400
Scott: They got Ye Olde Monopoly, sort of like the cable company on South Park.

138
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,140
Rym: An old, poorly secured database.

139
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,212
Rym: I don't understand how this keeps happening.

140
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:52,620
Scott: How is your database-- I mean, we have at work, we got MySQL databases.

141
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,839
Scott: I'm pretty sure no one can get into them.

142
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,140
Scott: Unless it was an inside job, how would you get in there?

143
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,249
Rym: Yeah, but then again, this is databases--.

144
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:07,360
Rym: Remember, these systems are accessible to the outside with their Adobe updaters and their account management.

145
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,940
Scott: Why is your database directly accessible without some sort of layer of application between it and the world?

146
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:15,100
Rym: That application itself is probably what was compromised.

147
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,698
Rym: A lot of times there'll be a customer portal and someone does some sort of attack to get that portal to start dumping records one by one.

148
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,400
Scott: Why did you write your portals so shittily?

149
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,919
Rym: Because there's literally no incentive to write them better.

150
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:31,440
Rym: This in no way affects Adobe.

151
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:33,739
Scott: Only if they didn't have Monopoly it would.

152
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:39,320
Rym: Even if they had Monopoly, the average user of these things does not care at all.

153
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,955
Scott: They probably just go, "Damn it, I gotta change my

154
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:41,460
Scott: password.".

155
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,640
Rym: I mentioned this at work, and nobody even knew it happened.

156
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,859
Rym: People who pay for Adobe.

157
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,219
Scott: People don't read the internet.

158
00:10:48,923 --> 00:10:51,880
Rym: I did not get an email from Adobe, so my account wasn't compromised.

159
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,940
Rym: I don't know what you're doing wrong, Scott.

160
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:57,360
Scott: We talked last time, I think, about the Google Glass.

161
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:58,860
Scott: Is that Google Glass?

162
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:04,520
Scott: People have been saying that more lately, and my response is-- Wait, they've stepped up their game.

163
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,199
Rym: They've gone from, "Ugh," to, "They recognize that Google Glass is a

164
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:08,360
Rym: thing.".

165
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,736
Scott: They say, "Is that Google

166
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:09,978
Scott: Glass?".

167
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,979
Rym: No, so they know the term, "Google

168
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:13,180
Rym: Glass.".

169
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,018
Scott: Sure, and my response lately has been, "What else could it

170
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:16,239
Scott: be?".

171
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:17,907
Scott: And they're sort of like,

172
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:19,217
Scott: "Oh.".

173
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:23,040
Scott: It's like, "I don't know, maybe some other company was making a thing.

174
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,470
Scott: I don't know what Google Glass looks

175
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:24,813
Scott: like.".

176
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,859
Scott: You said that people don't read internet.

177
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,471
Scott: Read internet.

178
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:30,120
Scott: Join.

179
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:37,680
Scott: Otherwise, basically, as soon as you confirm to me that you don't read internet, I now view you as a 20th century person.

180
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,179
Scott: I'm a 21st century person, and you don't fit in with me.

181
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,639
Rym: Oh, look at all the provincial plebs.

182
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,380
Scott: Look at all the old people.

183
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,453
Scott: "Oh, you're only 18, you don't read

184
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:47,775
Scott: internet?".

185
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:48,360
Scott: Old person.

186
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:50,225
Scott: Read internet.

187
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:52,139
Scott: That way you'll know what the fuck is going on.

188
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,640
Rym: Thing is, you didn't know about what does the fox say.

189
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:58,540
Scott: That is not as important.

190
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,509
Rym: Not as important?

191
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,280
Rym: Who are you to judge?

192
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,340
Scott: There are plenty of things I know about that you don't know about on internet.

193
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:04,168
Rym: Alright.

194
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:05,239
Rym: Name one.

195
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:07,419
Rym: Alright, let's go.

196
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,280
Rym: We need to play some sort of game of back and forth until someone fails.

197
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:13,536
Rym: So there's a mutual fail.

198
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,960
Rym: Maybe we should do that as its own episode.

199
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,240
Scott: Did you know about the pink flags in the NFL?

200
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:23,160
Rym: I imagine it has something to do with breast cancer.

201
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:24,325
Scott: Yeah.

202
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:26,319
Scott: But you don't know what the deal is.

203
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:30,780
Rym: Do they just throw a pink flag every time someone goes to second base on the field?

204
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:31,791
Scott: Second base?

205
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:32,520
Scott: It's not baseball.

206
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:36,195
Rym: So there's something you don't know.

207
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:40,957
Scott: Second base on the field?

208
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:41,140
Scott: Okay.

209
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:42,696
Scott: Let's move on.

210
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:45,110
Rym: Gonna try to steal home?

211
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:46,160
Rym: Is that what you're going for now?

212
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:48,776
Rym: We made Emily laugh.

213
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:49,019
Rym: I win.

214
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,260
Rym: So, unrelatedly, there's a lot of NSA news and you guys really should be reading that stuff too.

215
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,046
Scott: Haven't we gone over that?

216
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:58,860
Scott: We went over that news before it even happened.

217
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:01,940
Rym: When I was in high school...

218
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,225
Scott: Go look to the GeekNights Archive.

219
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:06,680
Scott: How many episodes can you find where we talk about that sort of shit?

220
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:16,180
Rym: Dude, if you know the kinds of BBS's I used to post to when I was in middle school, and you go to them, you'll see me complaining about basically what the NSA is doing today.

221
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:25,299
Rym: So, one of these secret court orders, this is a specific tiny thing related to the NSA that I think you should all be really aware of.

222
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,523
Rym: LavaBit.

223
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:29,059
Rym: A lot of people don't even know what LavaBit is.

224
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,054
Rym: LavaBit does secure communication stuff.

225
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:32,820
Rym: Cool, but it did.

226
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,600
Scott: It was a place where you could get a super secure email account where everything was encrypted and it was awesome.

227
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:38,871
Scott: And anonymous.

228
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:39,700
Rym: Run by cool people.

229
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,640
Scott: You can't get it anymore.

230
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,560
Rym: So, they got one of those secret court orders where they had to do stuff and if they said anything, jail.

231
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,300
Scott: So what he did is he just shut it down and he said "I'm shutting it down" and he didn't say anything else.

232
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:57,740
Rym: So, eventually, he won a victory in court and he was able to, and it's complicated how he did this.

233
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,754
Scott: Didn't the EFF help him or something?

234
00:13:58,795 --> 00:13:59,059
Rym: I don't know.

235
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,804
Rym: Someone helped him.

236
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:02,139
Rym: I'm skipping all the political stuff and just get to the tech part.

237
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,929
Rym: So, basically, he won disclosure.

238
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:07,660
Rym: The ACLU did straight up help him here.

239
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:16,260
Rym: So, apparently, the FBI had demanded that they turn over their root SSL certificate.

240
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:23,300
Rym: That has serious implications if that's the kind of thing that these secret court orders are demanding.

241
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,812
Rym: Because the people who are served them have basically no way to fight back.

242
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:41,640
Rym: and I won't blame anyone who, if their choice is "my life is fucked forever" or "I give the encryption keys for all of my users over to the government secretly", I'm not going to fault anyone who does the latter.

243
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,857
Scott: Okay, so here's the thing.

244
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:47,340
Rym: But I will not blame you that much if you buckle down.

245
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,658
Scott: I do not fault someone for complying with the court order and not having their life fucked.

246
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:52,100
Scott: I agree.

247
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:54,279
Scott: But I do fault him in another way.

248
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,480
Rym: The fact that he was going to hand it over anyway?

249
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:57,116
Rym: No.

250
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,420
Rym: Okay, because there's a lot more to the story.

251
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:08,300
Scott: When you make an SSL certificate or when you make an SSH key, you can encrypt it with a passphrase.

252
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:13,119
Scott: If it is encrypted with a passphrase, this is known law, even I know this law, right?

253
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,680
Scott: That if the government has warrants and all that stuff that they need, they can say "give us the key to your house" and you give them the key.

254
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,100
Scott: But if it's a combination safe and they say "give us the combination", you say "Fifth Amendment" and give them the finger, right?

255
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:26,205
Scott: Same thing.

256
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:27,515
Scott: They say "give us the SSL key".

257
00:15:27,736 --> 00:15:28,139
Scott: Here you go.

258
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,731
Scott: "Tell us the password to decrypt the SSL key".

259
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:32,200
Scott: Fifth Amendment, give them the finger.

260
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:36,940
Scott: If you didn't put a password on your SSL, then house secure was lava bit, really, to begin with.

261
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,232
Scott: So they didn't do something so basic.

262
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:39,080
Scott: So basic.

263
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:47,680
Rym: So the more sad implication is that with secret court orders, what if they say "also give us the password or we'll fuck you"?

264
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,440
Scott: I say Fifth Amendment, here's my fingers.

265
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,187
Rym: Yeah, so what if they just arrest you?

266
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:51,589
Rym: What do you do?

267
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:52,595
Rym: You can't fight it legally.

268
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:53,380
Scott: If you speak up?

269
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,688
Scott: If I have my Fifth Amendment, I'm going to keep using it.

270
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,900
Scott: Once I've gone down that road, I can't not go down that road.

271
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,368
Rym: Now he did a bunch of awesome things along the way.

272
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:04,340
Rym: He complied by printing it out.

273
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:05,899
Scott: That's also cool.

274
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:07,679
Rym: He printed it out and he handed it to them.

275
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,200
Scott: Yeah, I printed it out, handed it to them, and don't tell them the passphrase at the same time.

276
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,060
Rym: Yep, and the FBI complained.

277
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:19,780
Rym: "To make use of these keys, the FBI would have had to manually input all 2,560 characters..." Without error.

278
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,779
Rym: "Yes, and one incorrect keystroke in this laborious process would render the MVI system incapable of collecting decrypted

279
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:28,080
Rym: data.".

280
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:30,234
Scott: I would use OCR to get it in there.

281
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:32,384
Rym: I didn't read it fully.

282
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:36,380
Rym: The court order didn't necessarily say, specifically hand over the keys.

283
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:40,538
Rym: It said, "Give us the capability to read all your users'

284
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:40,980
Rym: traffic.".

285
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,247
Scott: Fifth Amendment, here's my fingers.

286
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,272
Scott: Why don't you smell them?

287
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:44,580
Scott: Why don't you pull them?

288
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,990
Rym: You're not incriminating yourself.

289
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:48,720
Rym: You're giving data on other people.

290
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:49,959
Scott: Oh, shit.

291
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,310
Scott: Yeah.

292
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:54,560
Rym: Now, here's the implication.

293
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,160
Scott: But what if I can be convicted of aiding and abetting them by providing this system?

294
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,179
Scott: Then I would be implicating myself, at least based on just logic and not based on necessarily law that I don't know.

295
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,520
Scott: No.

296
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,606
Rym: We're not lawyers.

297
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,008
Rym: We're just.

298
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,675
Scott: If someone listening to this thinks that I'm a lawyer...

299
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,939
Rym: Godspeed to you, good sir.

300
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,877
Scott: Here is my legal advice to you.

301
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:34,540
Scott: Rob a bank once in a town far away from where you live, tell someone you're going on vacation like Europe, go to Kansas, rob a bank in a complete covering your entire body head to toe in black, and then never go back, launder the money through bitcoins or some shit like that.

302
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:43,380
Rym: Scott, as your lawyer, I'm going to advise you that that is a terrible option because, one, advice my dad gave me is when I was young, never rob a goddamn bank.

303
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,878
Scott: Rob a restaurant when...

304
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,189
Rym: You'll do it once in a federal prison.

305
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:47,640
Scott: Two, there's not any money in there.

306
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,900
Scott: Rob a restaurant when the armored car is about to pick up the money.

307
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,511
Rym: Not a restaurant.

308
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:53,600
Rym: Not a sit-down restaurant.

309
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,378
Scott: A big time, yeah.

310
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,140
Rym: Because sit-down restaurants all get paid in credit cards and charge cards.

311
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:04,240
Rym: You want to rob a submarine shop or a burger joint or a place that deals mostly...

312
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,240
Scott: A popular place like a Shake Shack.

313
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:11,420
Rym: That deals mostly in cash, lunch crowd, and you want to figure out when their armored car comes and come the day before.

314
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,381
Scott: Yep.

315
00:18:12,402 --> 00:18:21,293
Scott: Also, if the armored car comes and he's got like four boxes on a trolley of cash, take one of the boxes and run, he won't abandon four boxes to go rescue one of them.

316
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,740
Scott: He's got to stay with those four.

317
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,240
Scott: And make sure you have a friend nearby...

318
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:25,780
Rym: Who grabs the other one?

319
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:32,400
Scott: If he's stupid and it bans those four boxes, he grabs the whole trolley, you drop the one box that you had and keep running.

320
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:34,136
Rym: Okay, that's our legal advice, but...

321
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:34,620
Scott: Yes.

322
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:39,740
Scott: And then live your whole rest of your life on that money and never commit a crime again because once there's a pattern, they'll get you.

323
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:46,880
Rym: The point of this is that this is why you should really think about your encryption workflows if you're the kind of person who cares about encryption.

324
00:18:47,120 --> 00:19:01,013
Scott: If you actually care about encryption, we've talked about it a lot on the show before, the one thing I'll just say, which is always the rule, is if you want the encryption to actually work and keep the feds out and keep other people out, it's going to be at least a little bit, probably a lot of hassle.

325
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:03,060
Scott: You have to be willing to deal with that hassle.

326
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:05,162
Rym: Pretty much.

327
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:10,740
Rym: But in this case, the worrying part is that the government is actually going after private keys...

328
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,759
Scott: Then they can ask for whatever they want.

329
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,080
Rym: Yeah, and they're probably going to get it because of these secret bullshit court orders.

330
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:26,958
Rym: Anyway, things of the day!

331
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:30,186
Rym: I'm a fan of a few Robin Hood movies.

332
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:31,830
Rym: I like Men in Tights.

333
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,889
Scott: Your favorite one's a Disney one, isn't it?

334
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:37,221
Rym: I really like the Fox Disney one.

335
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:38,886
Rym: Well, literally, he's a fox.

336
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:39,950
Rym: You're all furry.

337
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,642
Rym: I like that one, but I don't know if it holds up.

338
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,050
Rym: I've not seen it since I was very young.

339
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:51,930
Rym: I liked, when I was younger, the Robin of Locksley Robin Hood Men of Thieves one with Kevin Costner.

340
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,209
Rym: I don't know if that one holds up, though.

341
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,094
Scott: I don't know.

342
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:57,630
Scott: There's so many of them, I can't even separate them in my mind anymore.

343
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,058
Rym: That was the one that made Robin Hood popular again.

344
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:01,604
Rym: That was a big deal.

345
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,350
Rym: That movie was huge when it came out.

346
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,993
Rym: But I don't know if it holds up.

347
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:09,790
Rym: There's one Robin Hood that I don't think many of you have watched, and it turns out the entire thing is on YouTube.

348
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:11,699
Rym: This is the 1922 Silent Robin Hood.

349
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,564
Scott: Well, isn't that Public Domain?

350
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:16,537
Scott: 1922?

351
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:16,925
Rym: I think so.

352
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,653
Scott: 1922.

353
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:20,921
Rym: It's online, remastered.

354
00:20:21,182 --> 00:20:23,210
Rym: The quality is better than you would expect.

355
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:25,749
Scott: It looks really good.

356
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,243
Scott: A lot of films from that era were lost, but not that one.

357
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:29,330
Scott: That one was a big deal.

358
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:34,318
Rym: The first comment on YouTube is "Made Mary and His

359
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:34,679
Rym: Butters.".

360
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,970
Rym: So, now I gotta watch this and see what they're talking about.

361
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:38,608
Scott: Okay.

362
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:41,730
Rym: Wow, the comments are actually all-.

363
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,930
Scott: That could mean so many things, there's so many Butters episodes.

364
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:44,441
Rym: I know.

365
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:50,450
Rym: $5 says that everybody that was in this film, along with the production team and the directors, are probably dead by now.

366
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,630
Scott: Maybe when that guy says Butters, he doesn't mean the South Park character, he means something else.

367
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:56,248
Rym: I can't imagine anything else.

368
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:58,070
Scott: Urban Dictionary for Butters.

369
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:00,430
Rym: I don't want to look at Urban Dictionary for Butters.

370
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:01,069
Scott: I'm going to.

371
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,669
Rym: You're going to, because I'm not going to.

372
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:03,395
Scott: Okay.

373
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,410
Scott: You just keep talking.

374
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:05,870
Rym: Now, you can watch this movie.

375
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:07,730
Rym: I have not watched it yet.

376
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,089
Rym: I would like to watch it, but I will warn you.

377
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,910
Rym: It is 2 hours, 12 minutes, and 56 seconds long.

378
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,908
Rym: And it is a silent film.

379
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,019
Scott: Okay, so.

380
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,821
Scott: Urban Dictionary #1, Butters.

381
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,910
Scott: A sweet little boy from South Park.

382
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,129
Scott: He's so stupid and cute, don't you just want to hug him?

383
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:24,706
Rym: I do.

384
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:28,430
Scott: #2 for Butters on Urban Dictionary.

385
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:29,590
Scott: Ugly.

386
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,060
Scott: Don't fancy yours much.

387
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:32,209
Scott: She's well Butters.

388
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:34,450
Rym: I guess it's short for Butterface.

389
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,950
Scott: This means ugly when used to describe a person.

390
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,810
Scott: I think it comes from Butterface.

391
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:38,968
Rym: That's what I would assume.

392
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,782
Rym: Alright, I'm looking for Maid Marian in here.

393
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:41,669
Rym: now, I can't find her.

394
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:43,530
Rym: Oh, she's cute if that's Maid Marian.

395
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:45,550
Rym: I assume that's Maid Marian.

396
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,710
Rym: No, no, that's her stoop- yep, that's not her.

397
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,030
Rym: That's the woman who was the chicken in the Disney one.

398
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:53,532
Scott: Oh.

399
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,309
Rym: I know them by their animal type.

400
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:56,949
Scott: Sure.

401
00:21:57,471 --> 00:21:58,929
Rym: Anyway, what do you got for me?

402
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:03,410
Scott: So, uh, it's Monday, we like programming, we like games.

403
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,190
Scott: Here's this website, Puzzlescript.net.

404
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,870
Scott: And what Puzzlescript.net lets you do is on the left side, you can code.

405
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,530
Scott: And on the right, it makes a puzzle game from your code.

406
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:20,509
Scott: And it basically lets you code puzzle games, straight in the browser, and share the puzzles with people.

407
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:26,950
Scott: And it's actually kind of really cool and pretty easy, but also for reals programming, not some bullshit.

408
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:29,390
Scott: where like, you know, there's a GUI and you program in the GUI.

409
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,950
Scott: And it sort of makes those kind of puzzles that are like Lolo-ish.

410
00:22:33,231 --> 00:22:35,009
Scott: You know, where you walk around and push things.

411
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:37,490
Scott: It basically makes that kind of puzzle, like a Lolo style.

412
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,810
Rym: Lolo one was good, two was good, three's kind of shit.

413
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,430
Scott: Hey, if you don't know Lolo, go grab your NES emulator.

414
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,189
Rym: Just play Lolo.

415
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,630
Scott: Play Lolo, you can just figure it out, you don't need instructions.

416
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,169
Scott: You can read instructions online if you really need help.

417
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:53,850
Scott: That is a puzzle game that holds up big time.

418
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,790
Rym: That was a puzzle game for all time.

419
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,750
Rym: Lolo in Lolo 2, Lolo 3 is some bullshit because there's some timing-based puzzles.

420
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:01,790
Scott: Dude, that shit is crazy hard.

421
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,930
Scott: I mean... Two Two Rockets got nothing on Lolo.

422
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,230
Rym: Well, Two Two Rockets was more of a Twitch game.

423
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,189
Scott: Yeah, but it also had puzzle factor of knowing what the fuck to do.

424
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,350
Rym: Yeah, but I only ever played Two Two Rockets in four player multiplayer.

425
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,470
Rym: Because that is the only way to play that game.

426
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,530
Scott: The single player's kind of puzzling.

427
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,458
Scott: Yeah, forget that.

428
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:19,530
Rym: Four player multiplayer.

429
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,200
Rym: That shit is bananas.

430
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:22,530
Rym: B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

431
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:22,802
Scott: Sure.

432
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:25,810
Rym: So, in the meta moment, the Book Club book is Stazzyland.

433
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,329
Rym: I assume Scott is going to finish it soon.

434
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,209
Rym: It's kind of short.

435
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,800
Scott: I haven't read it since that.

436
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:31,529
Scott: one time I read it.

437
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:36,350
Rym: In the time that you have not read it, I've read like four more E&M Banks books.

438
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:39,290
Rym: For real.

439
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,710
Rym: I also read Catching Fire.

440
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:46,190
Scott: Not that I couldn't have read them, but I've just been doing all these other things instead.

441
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,570
Rym: Yeah, well, what's the whole point of this?

442
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:48,367
Rym: Read a book?

443
00:23:49,451 --> 00:23:49,802
Rym: Kids read?

444
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:51,910
Scott: If you would pick a book, I felt like reading.

445
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,810
Rym: So you don't care about overreach of government surveillance?

446
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:57,543
Scott: I do, I just don't.

447
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,230
Scott: Not motivated to read non-fiction, really.

448
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,670
Rym: Okay, well, you realize it's going to be all non-fiction.

449
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,730
Scott: Fine, I'm going to get the most possible fiction.

450
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:08,610
Rym: What could you possibly pick that I would not enjoy?

451
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,358
Scott: Super fiction.

452
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:10,250
Scott: It's like double fiction.

453
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:11,530
Scott: It's as fiction, you know.

454
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:18,390
Rym: There's only one book in the world you could pick that I probably would not enjoy, but I would read anyway, read quickly, and then give you shit about it.

455
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:22,636
Rym: That would be the third book in the Mr.

456
00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:23,790
Rym: Nice Guy's Penis Adventures.

457
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:28,470
Rym: We should just read The Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss.

458
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,410
Scott: Berenstain Bears.

459
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:35,668
Rym: So get this, the CTO of my company totally is reading The Kingkiller Chronicle and likes it.

460
00:24:36,696 --> 00:24:40,797
Rym: I know this because he told me about tabletop and all this PAX stuff.

461
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:41,929
Rym: He's like, "Yeah, you go to PAX, right?

462
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:44,370
Rym: I heard Patrick Rothfuss was there.

463
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:44,634
Rym: Holy

464
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:44,961
Rym: shit.".

465
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:48,119
Rym: And I was like, "Oh yeah, Mr.

466
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,363
Rym: Nice

467
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:48,707
Rym: Guy.".

468
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:50,349
Scott: Some people seem to really like him.

469
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,790
Scott: And his penis adventure.

470
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:57,069
Rym: If you haven't read that book club book, seriously, it's a nice guy going around with his dick.

471
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:00,149
Rym: That's pretty much the plot.

472
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,550
Rym: And I guess there's a king who gets killed.

473
00:25:03,653 --> 00:25:06,609
Scott: It's a book where the fedora is the most powerful guy in all the land.

474
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:07,635
Rym: Oh my god.

475
00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:10,169
Rym: He was born in a fedora.

476
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:11,026
Scott: Pretty much.

477
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:14,561
Rym: We've got video on the internet.

478
00:25:14,743 --> 00:25:15,430
Rym: We've got our forum.

479
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,210
Rym: If you want to join the forum, email us because we turned off.

480
00:25:19,473 --> 00:25:20,483
Scott: Even that's not working.

481
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:22,888
Scott: I sent someone an invite who asked for it.

482
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:24,850
Scott: Only one person has asked in that time period.

483
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:28,970
Scott: And I sent them the invite and they clicked on the link in the invite and there was a server error.

484
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,059
Rym: Dude, we had the vanilla guy on the show once.

485
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,109
Rym: Why don't we call him and be like, "Yo,

486
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,553
Rym: dog."

487
00:25:33,694 --> 00:25:35,290
Rym: He won't help us because they're not paying money.

488
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:41,349
Scott: So to get this problem solved, basically, we had to give vanilla a lot of monies.

489
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,614
Scott: Which is why I asked on the forum if anyone wants to pay.

490
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:46,368
Scott: We'll figure it out.

491
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:48,440
Scott: Give us time.

492
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,230
Scott: It's becoming more of an issue slowly.

493
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,623
Scott: It wasn't a big deal before.

494
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:53,310
Scott: It's entropy.

495
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,300
Rym: But give us time.

496
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,089
Rym: The reason we're slow on fixing that is that we've been doing a ton of video.

497
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,278
Rym: We're streaming stuff.

498
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:00,710
Rym: We have resumed production of GeekNights Presents.

499
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,723
Rym: In fact, I've got an episode.

500
00:26:02,986 --> 00:26:05,529
Rym: I've got Premiere open right now.

501
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,654
Rym: And I see I'm making a funny face.

502
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:11,453
Rym: Scott's got his ring finger out and he's kind of stroking it.

503
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:12,368
Rym: There's the Sea King.

504
00:26:13,412 --> 00:26:15,550
Scott: Let's check the calendar this weekend.

505
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,995
Scott: New York Comic Con, we're not going?

506
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:21,369
Rym: Yeah, not only are we not going, I kind of want to do a show on why we're not going.

507
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,034
Scott: Oh, whatever.

508
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,270
Scott: Next weekend after that, Burning Con 2013.

509
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,569
Rym: I'm running the most creatively titled session ever.

510
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,640
Scott: The Pentaclegon.

511
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:32,490
Rym: Let Sleeping Dogs Die.

512
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:35,129
Scott: Also, a ton of Netrunner tournaments in New York.

513
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:41,710
Scott: Then nothing else really on the calendar until Magfest.

514
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,804
Scott: In New Year's.

515
00:26:47,197 --> 00:26:47,926
Rym: Oh, it didn't clip.

516
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:48,189
Rym: Yes.

517
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,149
Rym: This picture is so great.

518
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,917
Rym: That was a raw... That did not clip and yet it was raw.

519
00:26:54,937 --> 00:26:57,389
Rym: I'm not compressing the signal at all on the inserts.

520
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:00,290
Rym: Anyway, so yeah, follow all our stuff.

521
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:07,018
Rym: If you like our videos and want us to make more of them faster, get them linked to on things and popular.

522
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:12,734
Scott: If suddenly we become really popular and someone gives us money or something, maybe we could even host the forum somewhere better.

523
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:29,628
Rym: I mean, one of you kids linked to our anime... Oh, we reviewed all that anime before it came out and one of you linked to it on Reddit and it got like 10,000 views immediately and there was a great thread of a few fanboys mad about it and the silent majority very happy about it.

524
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:33,730
Rym: Get that to happen to a few more videos and we might start doing video a little bit faster.

525
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:36,289
Rym: We might fix the forum a little bit faster.

526
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,828
Scott: Is there anything else to discuss?

527
00:27:38,414 --> 00:27:38,825
Rym: Not really.

528
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:47,630
Rym: GeekNights should be going pretty solidly for a while, though the first week of November I might be back in Istanbul and out of the way.

529
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,770
Scott: Why don't you just move there already?

530
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,670
Rym: Kind of Islamic in the government.

531
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,140
Scott: Oh, is that a problem?

532
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:54,778
Rym: Not a lot of free speech because of that.

533
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:55,930
Scott: Oh, is that a problem?

534
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,375
Rym: Yeah, it's a problem in a lot of places in the world.

535
00:27:58,395 --> 00:27:59,267
Rym: It's also a problem there.

536
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:00,609
Rym: That's a shame.

537
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,503
Rym: Can't really bike there.

538
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:03,150
Rym: No biking.

539
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,989
Rym: Biking just doesn't happen there.

540
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:07,009
Rym: Weather's nice, though.

541
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:09,130
Scott: If there's nice weather, why can't you bike?

542
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:11,549
Rym: You can't bike there.

543
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,490
Rym: The roads are unbikable.

544
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:14,970
Rym: No one bikes.

545
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,350
Rym: In fact, I mentioned that I bike as a hobby and someone said that I couldn't even have.

546
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,649
Scott: they must have bicycles.

547
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:23,189
Rym: They know of bicycles.

548
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:26,741
Scott: There has to be a bike shop in Istanbul.

549
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:31,750
Rym: Yes, people will mountain bike, but nobody uses bikes to transport themselves in Istanbul.

550
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:33,410
Scott: Istanbul on bike.

551
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,802
Scott: Two tires, two continents.

552
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:36,033
Scott: Let me read about this website.

553
00:28:36,094 --> 00:28:38,721
Rym: Basically, the roads are death traps for bikes.

554
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:42,518
Rym: There's no bike pads and the sidewalks are pretty much all cobblestone.

555
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:44,155
Scott: This is all off-road type biking.

556
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:44,378
Rym: Yes.

557
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,790
Rym: If you want to bike in a city, one, you have to have a death wish.

558
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,710
Scott: Bike tour of Istanbul.

559
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,329
Rym: Yes, that would be not fun at all.

560
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:55,290
Scott: Are there any companies?

561
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:56,630
Scott: Okay, okay.

562
00:28:57,191 --> 00:29:00,098
Scott: Are there any companies that do bicycle-led guided tours of Istanbul?

563
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:03,429
Scott: I've done these in Amsterdam and Berlin with companies like this one.

564
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,794
Rym: Okay, two of the most bikeable cities in the world.

565
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:10,279
Scott: Answer number one, if I'm honest, I wouldn't feel like biking across Istanbul.

566
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:15,667
Scott: It's a very hilly city with steep cobblestone streets in the older parts and a terrible traffic.

567
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,675
Scott: Response two, I agree with Patara.

568
00:29:19,755 --> 00:29:22,626
Scott: Even if someone is offering such a tour, I wouldn't do it.

569
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:28,010
Scott: Answer number three, like others well said, Istanbul is a very hilly city.

570
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,210
Scott: It would be very difficult to ride unless you're a good biker.

571
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,710
Scott: There was no such service.

572
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,670
Rym: What my friend said to me, and I'm going to quote them pretty directly, "Biking in Istanbul?

573
00:29:36,153 --> 00:29:36,560
Rym: You would

574
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,946
Rym: die.".

575
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:39,629
Rym: That is exactly what he said.

576
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:42,647
Rym: And then, "How do you bike in New

577
00:29:42,668 --> 00:29:42,870
Rym: York?".

578
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,943
Rym: And I was like, "We have bike

579
00:29:43,963 --> 00:29:44,226
Rym: lanes.".

580
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:46,769
Rym: He was like, "Hahahaha, a bike lane.

581
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:48,850
Rym: You mean a lane that's just for bikes?

582
00:29:51,016 --> 00:29:51,290
Scott: Hahahaha.".

583
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:51,981
Scott: Anyway.

584
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:52,550
Rym: Anyway.

585
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:53,508
Scott: So, yeah.

586
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,622
Rym: A while ago, we did a show.

587
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,864
Rym: We talked about HVAC and cooling and servers and things.

588
00:29:58,884 --> 00:29:59,693
Scott: That was a long time ago.

589
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:00,946
Rym: But I realized something.

590
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:01,855
Rym: I realized a couple of things.

591
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:04,784
Rym: One, I didn't learn any of this at RIT, really.

592
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:05,835
Rym: Like, RIT kind of...

593
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:06,542
Scott: You have to take it.

594
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:08,825
Scott: You don't learn that in technology classes, right?

595
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:13,350
Scott: You learn that in like, you know, vocational school or engineers, you learn it, right?

596
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,828
Scott: Because engineers learn about heating and cooling.

597
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,525
Rym: But yet, IT people need to know this stuff.

598
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:16,930
Scott: Yeah.

599
00:30:17,744 --> 00:30:24,408
Rym: And I learned other similar things, like cable management, wiring houses...

600
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,434
Scott: It's not an architect would learn, right?

601
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:30,314
Scott: There's like a crossover there between architects, engineers, you know, that sort of thing.

602
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:40,295
Rym: Yeah, but like in IT, at RIT, I took classes where there were drywall walls and we had to cut for panels and run cables through them and do everything like you would in a residential building.

603
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,709
Rym: Like, we did all that stuff.

604
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,716
Rym: But for whatever reason, we didn't learn anything other than the bare-bone basis of HVAC.

605
00:30:46,736 --> 00:31:04,533
Rym: So, I want to kind of take a page from some of the older how-to episodes we did and talk about a very specific problem in cooling that many of you young kids might run into going out into the industry out there like your first job in IT and how to solve it without fucking everything

606
00:31:04,553 --> 00:31:04,594
Scott: up.

607
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:07,462
Scott: Yeah, because you're not going to go from nothing to big data center.

608
00:31:07,503 --> 00:31:08,877
Scott: And big data centers are all weird.

609
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:11,060
Scott: They all do different things for the heating and cooling.

610
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:11,383
Rym: Yep.

611
00:31:11,484 --> 00:31:13,364
Rym: And they already have something in place.

612
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:13,728
Rym: Yeah.

613
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:14,879
Rym: You just have to use it.

614
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:15,606
Scott: Exactly.

615
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:17,204
Scott: Like, look at what Facebook has in place.

616
00:31:17,224 --> 00:31:21,830
Scott: They have like these ridiculous, like, giant, slow fans with this water.

617
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:23,668
Scott: You can see a video on YouTube about it.

618
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,837
Rym: But Scott's right.

619
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,577
Rym: If you're in the job of designing the data center, you already know this stuff.

620
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:28,941
Rym: Exactly.

621
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:39,485
Rym: If you just get a job working at the data center, even if no one tells you anything, you can go there for the first time, go to your rack, look to the left and to the right, and there's two other racks that are set up correctly.

622
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:40,718
Rym: Just do what they did.

623
00:31:41,002 --> 00:31:41,204
Scott: Yep.

624
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:44,318
Rym: Look at their rack and buy the same parts if you have to.

625
00:31:45,108 --> 00:31:59,264
Rym: But the other reason I bring this up is that if you're an intern or a co-op or it's your first IT job, this is the kind of job that the people who already work at the company will give to you to fix because they don't want to deal with it and they don't care.

626
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:07,103
Scott: Yeah, usually any company, right, no matter how big the company is, even if their stuff is in a data center, the office, every office has a server closet.

627
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:20,090
Scott: Even if there's nothing in that server closet besides, like, the connection to the internet, the router, and a bunch of switches, there's still a closet, and most likely, I've never seen a case in my life where it was literally just the routers and switches.

628
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,826
Scott: There's other stuff in there, right?

629
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:29,786
Scott: Yep, it might be your phone system, it might be your Outlook cache, it could be, it could actually often be, like, the actual active domain servers.

630
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:31,260
Rym: Or at least a copy of it.

631
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:31,604
Rym: Right.

632
00:32:31,664 --> 00:32:36,009
Scott: Or there'll be some sort of firewall things, like those Barracuda things, or all kinds of...

633
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:37,059
Rym: Don't buy those things, but I digress.

634
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,150
Scott: I know, but there'll be lots of things.

635
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:44,938
Scott: The things that are computers that are generating heat on a rack, right, that aren't just switches, not that switches don't make heat either.

636
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:50,510
Rym: Now, also, many of you will be in the situation I'm in, I'm just gonna go through this exact situation.

637
00:32:50,994 --> 00:33:07,848
Rym: You are pointed at a small server room that's in the office, it's got, I don't know, maybe ten or so servers in it, some telco equipment, maybe your, like, Fios business thing is in there, maybe there's some other equipment laying around, it's a little room, and you're in a building where it doesn't really have the best AC.

638
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:11,482
Rym: So you've got this room with servers in it, and there's some matter...

639
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:14,612
Scott: Yeah, no one puts the closet in, like, a really well air-conditioned room.

640
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:15,461
Scott: It's a closet.

641
00:33:15,481 --> 00:33:18,050
Scott: They cram it in the tiniest space possible to save money.

642
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,279
Rym: Often without the permission of the building itself.

643
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,280
Scott: Yeah, a lot of these buildings, especially in New York, are old before the time of computers.

644
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:27,119
Scott: There wasn't a room made for this stuff, right?

645
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:40,795
Scott: You're just basically finding a closet, or even in a lot of cases, you'll just have, like, the person who's renovating the office just make two walls in a corner to create a box, and then they'll install a rack by screwing it into the floor, and there you go, it's a rack.

646
00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:48,835
Rym: Now the final point, the room I'm gonna talk about is the kind of room where the servers in it are kind of important, but not that important.

647
00:33:49,118 --> 00:33:52,268
Scott: Right, you're not, if your company is so dumb, they've put their, like,

648
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,158
Rym: a lot of them

649
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,067
Scott: are that dumb, yes, most, in fact,

650
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:56,370
Rym: but

651
00:33:56,875 --> 00:34:02,210
Scott: if your company's that dumb that your super essential data is pretty much in this room, and only in that room, you're in big trouble already.

652
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:04,529
Scott: See episodes about backups and such.

653
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:17,420
Scott: But, you know, you still, that room, it might not be the most important thing, like the end of the world if it fails, but it's still bad, if something happens to just routers and switches, no one in the office has internet.

654
00:34:18,085 --> 00:34:19,261
Scott: Good job, now no one can work.

655
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:19,688
Rym: Yup.

656
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:23,119
Rym: You know, imagine, there are jobs where that wouldn't stop you.

657
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,009
Rym: Sure.

658
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,329
Rym: I can't imagine having a job like that.

659
00:34:26,712 --> 00:34:29,684
Scott: But in my office, if the internet goes out for too long, people just go home.

660
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:38,190
Rym: If I lost internet connectivity, I would pretty much take my laptop down to Starbucks, and if it didn't get fixed within like an hour, I'd just go home.

661
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:38,958
Scott: That's what we do.

662
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:44,170
Scott: So, the situation, but I guess if your job is to fix that, you have something to do and you can't go home.

663
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,889
Rym: So here's the situation I was confronted with.

664
00:34:46,190 --> 00:35:00,849
Rym: Shitty old building, get to a new company, there's the system administrator leaves or whatever, but doesn't really matter, because everything's kind of going fine, and you have, all your stuff is not on those, no, you have system administrators dealing with the real servers that matter everywhere else.

665
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,913
Scott: Yeah, the clouds, you know, data centers.

666
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:04,370
Rym: But I'm confronted with a closet.

667
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:10,999
Rym: The closet has a sign on it that says, and I quote, "Do not close this door ever under any

668
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,868
Rym: circumstances.".

669
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:13,946
Rym: It's printed and taped to the door.

670
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:14,370
Scott: Uh oh.

671
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:15,924
Rym: And it's loud in that room.

672
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:17,524
Rym: It's loud and you hear it in the office.

673
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:18,010
Scott: Uh oh.

674
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:23,080
Rym: I peek my head in this room, and I see a rack with ten or so servers on it.

675
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,850
Scott: Is the wiring nice?

676
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:25,426
Rym: Oh, the wiring's acceptable.

677
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:25,770
Rym: Okay.

678
00:35:25,932 --> 00:35:28,921
Rym: It is, it is, it is not how I would wire things.

679
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:30,990
Scott: That's usually the first sign though, right?

680
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:32,780
Rym: It's the sign of competence.

681
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:44,899
Rym: If you see a rack, and it's a rat's nest, back away slowly, or make it your job to fix it, because once you fix it, no one else will ever be able to touch it again.

682
00:35:45,485 --> 00:35:46,477
Scott: Get a fluke first.

683
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:47,310
Scott: Yeah.

684
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,940
Rym: That was my job many years ago, and I am, it was except, kind of like with authors or writing.

685
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,438
Rym: Like, there are books that are well written enough to be enjoyable.

686
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,598
Rym: Like, uh, The Hunger Games.

687
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:01,850
Rym: Perfectly well written.

688
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,608
Rym: But, they don't, I do not appreciate their writing.

689
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:06,762
Rym: They're merely functional.

690
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:07,409
Rym: They are not good.

691
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,370
Rym: This is wired functionally.

692
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,709
Rym: It's fine, but it's no Hawthorne.

693
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:16,477
Rym: It's no cavalier and clay.

694
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:17,610
Rym: It's no prince of nothing.

695
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:19,347
Rym: So, whatever.

696
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,618
Rym: The wiring's fine.

697
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:32,718
Rym: The room's fine, but it's got this huge black AC unit, just churning, and there's two rabbit ear sort of tubes coming out of the top of it, just going into the room.

698
00:36:32,778 --> 00:36:34,717
Rym: Not going into the ceiling or anything, just going into the room.

699
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:35,970
Scott: So, the air conditioner's doing nothing.

700
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:37,488
Rym: Kind of, yeah.

701
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:39,869
Scott: It's actually making the room hotter, in fact.

702
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:41,690
Scott: So, despite the laws of physics.

703
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,942
Rym: There's another consumer level air conditioner.

704
00:36:44,962 --> 00:36:45,548
Rym: Okay.

705
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,101
Rym: That also has two.

706
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,960
Scott: Does people not know how air conditioners work?

707
00:36:49,445 --> 00:36:50,517
Rym: Uh, I don't think most people do.

708
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:57,289
Rym: That also has two of these rabbit ear tubes out of the top, running, and that one is running all the time.

709
00:36:59,132 --> 00:36:59,606
Rym: All the time.

710
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:01,510
Rym: And the door is held open.

711
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:07,389
Rym: And I hear a story that one time, a long time ago, someone closed the door, and then the room overheated and the servers all crashed.

712
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:08,154
Scott: Yeah.

713
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:12,568
Rym: So, they have to leave the door open because the magic swirls make everything work.

714
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:14,638
Rym: And I ignored it.

715
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:15,546
Rym: Wasn't my job.

716
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:15,970
Rym: Didn't care.

717
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:21,969
Scott: You didn't just take one of the hoses on the black one and stick it, the hot hose, and send it out to where?

718
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:22,859
Scott: To where?

719
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,489
Rym: There's no window.

720
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,308
Rym: Completely interior room.

721
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:26,614
Scott: Oh.

722
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,109
Scott: There's not like a duct you can cut a hole in?

723
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,140
Rym: Uh, there could've been, but it hadn't been cut.

724
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,675
Scott: You could've at least drag it so it's coming out the door.

725
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:39,040
Rym: This is the first rule of IT.

726
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:41,361
Rym: If it is not your job, don't fucking touch it.

727
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:44,494
Scott: Just drag the hot hose so it shoots directly out the front door.

728
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:45,808
Scott: Uh, yeah.

729
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,433
Rym: I could do something like that, but you touch it, you own it.

730
00:37:48,534 --> 00:38:00,030
Rym: If you get a job, if you're an intern, and you get hired at a company and they hire you for real, and you once set up their phone system, that is your job no matter what you do for the rest of your time at that company.

731
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:01,625
Rym: You touch it, you own it.

732
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:04,416
Rym: At least in small to mid-sized companies.

733
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,063
Scott: Okay.

734
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:05,124
Scott: So,

735
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:29,207
Rym: if you're hired to do X, and you see problem Y, and it took me a long time in my own professional career to learn this, unless you really, really are invested in this company, and you have the clout to be able to disentangle yourself from it later, don't touch Y. Let whoever's doing Y do Y, and unless you were asked by the people who are your bosses to touch Y, just ignore it.

736
00:38:30,213 --> 00:38:31,769
Rym: So, I ignored this.

737
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:42,233
Rym: And then the guy who had set it up, who apparently had just sort of inherited from another guy from another, you know, distant past, no one in the office currently really knew why it was set up the way it was.

738
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,940
Scott: And no one knew how an air conditioner worked.

739
00:38:45,142 --> 00:38:48,069
Rym: So, one day, it, uh, smelled smoke.

740
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:49,630
Rym: There was some smoke.

741
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:51,022
Scott: Of course.

742
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:56,781
Rym: So, hello over there, and I see that the mini air conditioner, the outlet had caught fire.

743
00:38:57,025 --> 00:38:57,410
Scott: Of course.

744
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,821
Rym: So, I put the fire out.

745
00:38:59,002 --> 00:38:59,770
Scott: With a fire extinguisher?

746
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:00,596
Rym: Uh, no.

747
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:02,455
Rym: I just kind of hit it, and then I unplugged it.

748
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:02,758
Rym: Okay.

749
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,050
Rym: It was like this smoldering fire.

750
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,220
Rym: I stepped on it.

751
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,963
Scott: So, that was the air conditioner that was actually doing something.

752
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:07,429
Scott: Yeah.

753
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:09,830
Rym: So, I decided I had to fix this.

754
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:21,449
Rym: So, the first thing you need to know about air conditioners is that for a sealed room like this, which is usually where the server rooms go, you're not going to waste your corner office for servers, especially in New York.

755
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:28,462
Rym: So, this server room is always going to be some interior room with probably no actual ventilation of any kind.

756
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:29,070
Scott: That's a problem.

757
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,438
Rym: There are two kinds of sealed room air conditioners.

758
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,469
Rym: One of them has a single hose.

759
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,849
Rym: Hot air blows out of this hose.

760
00:39:38,031 --> 00:39:38,395
Rym: Yes.

761
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:41,203
Rym: Those are bullshit air conditioners.

762
00:39:41,264 --> 00:39:43,405
Rym: If you buy an air conditioner like that, you're fucked up.

763
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:43,850
Scott: Yep.

764
00:39:44,191 --> 00:39:46,090
Rym: Because they cause a negative pressure situation.

765
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:51,304
Rym: If you put that in this room, just put it in the room, it's just going to slowly heat the room up.

766
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:55,102
Scott: Yeah, the hot air will come out of that hose and heat up the room because it's an interior room.

767
00:39:55,364 --> 00:40:01,446
Scott: You're supposed to use that one as a window, and you can throw that hose out the window, and thus sending the hot from the room out the window.

768
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:07,970
Rym: Now, those systems still suck anyway, because let's say, let's assume, that I vent the hot air into the ceiling.

769
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:08,373
Rym: Okay.

770
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:09,100
Rym: I get rid of it.

771
00:40:09,464 --> 00:40:11,228
Scott: And it's not going to come down, because hot air goes up.

772
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:12,735
Rym: Wouldn't matter.

773
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:19,569
Rym: I'd still be fucked, because this system, one, is now pressurizing the ceiling, unless it can get out somewhere, but let's ignore that for now.

774
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,888
Rym: It's also depressurizing the room.

775
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:25,787
Scott: Wouldn't it be depressurizing the ceiling and pressurizing the room?

776
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:25,889
Rym: No.

777
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,624
Rym: So it's exhausting.

778
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:28,696
Scott: The room is cold?

779
00:40:28,898 --> 00:40:31,606
Rym: Air is being forced out that exhaust tube into the ceiling.

780
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,432
Scott: Oh, yeah, but hot air is lower pressure than the...

781
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:37,119
Rym: No, no, it's air pressure from the fan, not the heat.

782
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:40,735
Scott: But, yeah, you have a fan basically blowing out without any fans blowing in, right?

783
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:40,937
Scott: Yes.

784
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:46,150
Rym: So, much like a negative pressure case, the room you're air conditioning now, let's ignore the ceiling for a minute.

785
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,989
Scott: Is sucking in the air from the outside room.

786
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,624
Rym: From wherever it can get it.

787
00:40:49,745 --> 00:40:51,746
Scott: Which is gonna be the hot air you just blew out.

788
00:40:51,806 --> 00:40:56,350
Rym: So if you shut the door, it's gonna pull it through the cracks and pull that hot air right the fuck back into the room.

789
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:56,754
Scott: That's right.

790
00:40:56,977 --> 00:41:01,505
Rym: And if you leave the door open, you're basically trying to air condition your entire office now.

791
00:41:01,687 --> 00:41:01,910
Scott: Yep.

792
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:03,262
Rym: Instead of just that room.

793
00:41:03,343 --> 00:41:06,254
Rym: And, yeah, that doesn't work because your office is probably big.

794
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:07,002
Rym: Of course.

795
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:13,080
Rym: Single hose air conditioners are useless in 95% of situations.

796
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:14,981
Rym: Never ever buy them.

797
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:17,849
Scott: It's good for your house if you want to air condition your whole house.

798
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:18,818
Rym: It's terrible for your house.

799
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:19,689
Rym: Well, yeah, your whole house.

800
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:20,312
Scott: Right.

801
00:41:20,332 --> 00:41:20,959
Scott: Your whole house.

802
00:41:21,302 --> 00:41:23,382
Rym: But then how many of these units are you gonna need?

803
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:24,332
Rym: Because one of those units...

804
00:41:24,352 --> 00:41:26,634
Scott: Well, remember Alex had that one monster one.

805
00:41:26,796 --> 00:41:28,515
Rym: Yeah, that would not cool this apartment.

806
00:41:29,061 --> 00:41:29,950
Scott: No, not this apartment.

807
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:30,556
Scott: Maybe mine.

808
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:31,182
Scott: Work on mine.

809
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:33,101
Rym: Maybe yours if you close the bedroom door.

810
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:35,445
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, I basically have two monster ones.

811
00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:39,041
Rym: You can go to websites and calculate how many BTU of cooling you need and all that.

812
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:39,850
Rym: I'm not getting into that stuff.

813
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,700
Rym: You can figure that out later.

814
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:44,555
Rym: So I had to fix this now because I have a vested interest...

815
00:41:44,575 --> 00:41:46,169
Scott: So you went to the internet to buy an air conditioner.

816
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,753
Rym: Yeah.

817
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:50,717
Rym: So first thing I did is I looked around the room and I looked at the big air conditioner that wasn't doing anything.

818
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:53,061
Scott: That was just blowing both hoses into the room?

819
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:53,324
Rym: Yep.

820
00:41:53,445 --> 00:42:01,103
Rym: It was basically just a big fan circulating in the room and then the other air conditioner was blowing cold air into the servers and then hot air was coming out.

821
00:42:01,124 --> 00:42:05,768
Rym: So it was keeping the servers kind of cool at the expense of everything else in the room, which is why it burned out.

822
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,303
Rym: So here's how I fixed this situation.

823
00:42:09,464 --> 00:42:11,060
Rym: One, I threw away the busted air conditioner.

824
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:11,970
Scott: The one that was on fire?

825
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,171
Rym: Yes.

826
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:13,303
Rym: So now you have a room.

827
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:22,029
Rym: Let's assume you bought or somehow got a two hose air conditioner, meaning one hose sucks air in, the other hose pushes air out.

828
00:42:22,955 --> 00:42:30,899
Rym: And then independent of that, there's a filtered intake that takes air from the room in, cools it, and puts the cool air back out into the room.

829
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:33,889
Rym: Two completely independent cycles of air.

830
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,302
Rym: Yep.

831
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:41,062
Rym: So I found the interface for a drop ceiling for these hoses.

832
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:42,113
Rym: I put it in the ceiling.

833
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:44,133
Scott: Those are some long hoses.

834
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:46,618
Rym: Yeah, the hoses are like 10 feet long.

835
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:47,184
Scott: Oh, pretty good.

836
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:52,658
Rym: So I route them to the ceiling and the top of this has a nice deflector unit.

837
00:42:52,982 --> 00:42:55,448
Rym: So the intake is coming from one side, like eh?

838
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:58,538
Rym: And then it's exhausting to the other side, the other direction.

839
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:03,470
Rym: So it's going to heat up that area, but I don't know the pressure situation in this ceiling.

840
00:43:04,112 --> 00:43:05,470
Rym: I poke my head up there.

841
00:43:05,892 --> 00:43:09,188
Rym: It's pretty big and I feel I can get away with this.

842
00:43:10,112 --> 00:43:14,234
Rym: So I set this up, I set the unit to cool, and I closed the door.

843
00:43:14,254 --> 00:43:15,810
Scott: Closed the door?

844
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,269
Scott: Did people freak out when you closed the door?

845
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:19,305
Rym: Yes, people freaked out.

846
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:22,690
Rym: So I took the sign and I put it on the fridge instead because I thought that was kind of funny.

847
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:28,076
Rym: Later we got an intern who saw him.

848
00:43:28,418 --> 00:43:37,770
Rym: He went over to the fridge, he opened it, he closed the fridge after he got his drink, then he looked at the sign, then he kind of looked around like he wasn't quite sure what the deal was with the sign.

849
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:38,990
Scott: Should I leave the fridge open?

850
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:43,874
Rym: And then he walked away from it, so I considered that.

851
00:43:43,935 --> 00:43:44,888
Scott: That sounds like it's a good one.

852
00:43:45,988 --> 00:43:50,848
Rym: So eventually, the unit shut itself down.

853
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:51,492
Scott: What?

854
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:52,789
Scott: Why?

855
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:57,089
Scott: Oh, because it was cold enough and it has a thermostat.

856
00:43:57,854 --> 00:44:00,490
Rym: So I got an SNMP trap because I set all that up too, duh.

857
00:44:01,694 --> 00:44:04,490
Rym: So I go in there and I look because it said head pressure high.

858
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:09,249
Rym: So sure enough, there's two things going on here.

859
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,277
Rym: The ceiling is a closed pressure system.

860
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,769
Rym: That full ceiling doesn't actually go anywhere.

861
00:44:16,392 --> 00:44:20,730
Rym: Except it goes a little bit into the drop ceiling of a neighbor's office.

862
00:44:22,274 --> 00:44:26,770
Rym: So I learned later, he just kept turning his AC down because it kept getting really hot over there for some reason.

863
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,646
Rym: He couldn't figure out why.

864
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:29,710
Rym: But that's a separate thing.

865
00:44:31,274 --> 00:44:33,903
Rym: The reason I had a high head pressure was for two reasons.

866
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:36,385
Rym: One, the system was set up wrong.

867
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:38,062
Rym: I should have looked at what the other people had set it to.

868
00:44:38,082 --> 00:44:43,790
Rym: They set the temperature that the AC unit was striving for to be 60 fucking degrees Fahrenheit.

869
00:44:44,113 --> 00:44:44,537
Scott: Okay.

870
00:44:44,861 --> 00:44:46,780
Rym: So rookie mistake number one.

871
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,599
Rym: If you ever set up an air conditioner for cool servers, you might think colder is better.

872
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:51,470
Rym: That is not true.

873
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:52,759
Scott: No.

874
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:53,810
Rym: Cold enough is better.

875
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:54,392
Scott: Yes.

876
00:44:54,412 --> 00:44:58,130
Scott: It doesn't matter if the servers are, like, look at your computer's temperature.

877
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,970
Scott: Is it 75?

878
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:00,557
Scott: Is it 80?

879
00:45:00,557 --> 00:45:03,109
Scott: Well, what temperature does the computer overheat?

880
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:05,831
Scott: 100? 120?

881
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,719
Scott: So if it's 90, the computer still works, right?

882
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:09,082
Scott: Right?

883
00:45:09,163 --> 00:45:12,254
Scott: Will the computer shorten its life or become damaged at 90?

884
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:12,557
Scott: Well, no.

885
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:15,810
Scott: Then why not 90?

886
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:19,164
Scott: Why spend more energy to go down to 80 for no benefit whatsoever?

887
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:24,010
Rym: So if you set an air conditioner too low, I've seen a lot of people do this in their houses.

888
00:45:24,533 --> 00:45:25,489
Rym: Oh, it's too hot in here.

889
00:45:25,952 --> 00:45:27,244
Rym: And the air conditioner's already running.

890
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:29,770
Rym: They'll turn the temperature all the way down on the air conditioner.

891
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,658
Rym: That doesn't do anything.

892
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:31,062
Scott: It does nothing.

893
00:45:31,203 --> 00:45:32,475
Rym: Except eventually ruin your air conditioner.

894
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:33,989
Scott: The air conditioner's either on or off.

895
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:37,690
Rym: Well, the compressor, the condenser is on or off, independent of that anyway.

896
00:45:38,411 --> 00:45:46,816
Rym: So I set that to a reasonable temperature, which for a server room like this, set it to somewhere between 76 and 78 degrees.

897
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:47,344
Scott: Sounds good.

898
00:45:47,465 --> 00:45:48,523
Rym: That is fine.

899
00:45:48,727 --> 00:45:48,890
Rym: Yeah.

900
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:50,798
Scott: So it was running all the time.

901
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:51,465
Scott: That's what my computer is.

902
00:45:51,546 --> 00:45:52,354
Rym: That was one problem.

903
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:57,181
Rym: The second problem was that the hoses were directional.

904
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:01,323
Rym: And whoever had put the hoses on, just put them on backwards when they set it up.

905
00:46:01,465 --> 00:46:02,334
Rym: I didn't even look at that.

906
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:03,549
Scott: They're not just plastic tubes?

907
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:05,790
Rym: They're plastic expanding tubes, right?

908
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:07,260
Scott: How could they be directional?

909
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,067
Scott: They're just empty tubes.

910
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:11,015
Rym: This is why I'm doing this show, because this shit isn't obvious.

911
00:46:11,055 --> 00:46:11,783
Scott: I didn't know this.

912
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:15,015
Rym: I only knew this because I dealt with this shit when I worked at that hospital.

913
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:19,850
Rym: So a lot of those tubes are directional, because if you have a kinky tube that expands and contracts, right?

914
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:21,198
Rym: You know those tubes.

915
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:21,460
Rym: Yeah.

916
00:46:21,742 --> 00:46:22,912
Rym: If you collapse part of it...

917
00:46:22,933 --> 00:46:25,077
Scott: It was already the tube I was imagining before you said anything.

918
00:46:25,097 --> 00:46:28,470
Rym: So if you collapse it, what shape is that collapse thing on the inside?

919
00:46:29,471 --> 00:46:31,858
Scott: Just a smaller circle than...

920
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,389
Rym: Not quite, because it folds over on itself.

921
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:40,287
Rym: So in one direction, it'll fold where the things... Say the air is blowing upward, right?

922
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:41,849
Rym: And I put this thing on top.

923
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:46,050
Rym: The folds, if you have it folded, will be aiming upward as well.

924
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,710
Scott: So I'm imagining one that's just sort of like an accordion, and when you just squeeze it, it just gets narrower, basically.

925
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,230
Rym: Yeah, that's not how any of those things are like.

926
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,199
Scott: Oh, they're not accordion-shaped?

927
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,390
Rym: They're not just accordion-shaped.

928
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,389
Rym: Because then, how would it kink and hold its shape?

929
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:02,010
Scott: Oh, that kind!

930
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:02,714
Rym: Oh!

931
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,940
Rym: So, let's imagine I reverse this.

932
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:06,870
Rym: I put the wrong tube on.

933
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:19,679
Rym: So air is trying to blow out, and all the baffles from where it's folded are pointing down, and there's little... Basically, it causes these little crevices that will ridiculously reduce the amount of air that can be pumped through them at any given time.

934
00:47:20,164 --> 00:47:21,760
Rym: Your efficiency will go to shit.

935
00:47:22,123 --> 00:47:24,890
Rym: So if you buy an air conditioner, read the manual.

936
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:27,798
Rym: It'll say something like, "This one goes out.

937
00:47:28,101 --> 00:47:28,808
Rym: This one goes

938
00:47:28,909 --> 00:47:28,949
Rym: in.".

939
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,349
Scott: There weren't little arrows on the tubes?

940
00:47:30,636 --> 00:47:31,108
Scott: There weren't.

941
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:33,867
Rym: But you can tell by the shape.

942
00:47:33,907 --> 00:47:39,604
Rym: If you don't have the documentation, just kink one, and then look at it and think, "What does this look like on the

943
00:47:39,644 --> 00:47:40,070
Rym: inside?".

944
00:47:40,332 --> 00:47:43,248
Rym: And you will figure out which was the right one and which one's the wrong one.

945
00:47:44,211 --> 00:47:46,894
Rym: So, I did that, and everything was 100% fine.

946
00:47:47,137 --> 00:47:47,440
Scott: The end.

947
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,140
Rym: That's all I had to do.

948
00:47:49,281 --> 00:47:49,950
Scott: And you closed the door?

949
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,423
Rym: I closed the door and left it closed.

950
00:47:51,443 --> 00:47:51,969
Scott: And now you own it?

951
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:53,218
Rym: Yeah, now I own it.

952
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:56,852
Scott: What did people in the office... I guess all of them are dumber than you, 100% of them?

953
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,881
Rym: No, they ignored it because it had been working fine.

954
00:47:59,349 --> 00:47:59,389
Scott: Oh.

955
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:01,429
Rym: No one touched it until it broke.

956
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:06,430
Scott: But they didn't realize there was something wrong with just simply the fact that you couldn't close the door?

957
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,694
Rym: Whoever originally set it up didn't know how this shit worked.

958
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,090
Scott: And no one else even looked?

959
00:48:10,251 --> 00:48:11,490
Rym: No one else even looked in the room, because who cares?

960
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:16,857
Scott: And there was a door that said, "Do not close ever," and it was making noise and bothering everyone?

961
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:17,970
Scott: I consider that to be broken.

962
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,329
Rym: It wasn't enough noise to really bother anyone, it's just I noticed it because I noticed that stuff.

963
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,667
Rym: But, so I own it.

964
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,344
Rym: So another problem happened.

965
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:28,582
Rym: One day, I got a sensor warning that said humidity too high.

966
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:29,170
Scott: Uh oh.

967
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,618
Rym: So I go in there.

968
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,358
Scott: The air conditioner doesn't dehumidify?

969
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:33,450
Rym: Uh, it does.

970
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,310
Scott: I mean, I've never seen an air conditioner that doesn't.

971
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:38,718
Rym: Yeah, so what do air conditioners do with the water?

972
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:40,397
Scott: They have a little hose that drops it outside.

973
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,126
Scott: Not all.

974
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,910
Scott: Onto passersby on the sidewalk.

975
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:47,021
Rym: So, most of these dual hose conditioners don't do that.

976
00:48:47,082 --> 00:48:48,113
Scott: Do they keep it in a little bucket?

977
00:48:48,397 --> 00:48:49,004
Rym: No, they have a bucket.

978
00:48:49,024 --> 00:48:49,450
Scott: And you empty it?

979
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,035
Rym: They have a bucket.

980
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:52,397
Rym: in case that has to be emptied sometimes, maybe.

981
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:55,308
Rym: But what they actually do is use that hot air going out.

982
00:48:55,772 --> 00:48:57,249
Rym: They evaporate it into that.

983
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:58,217
Scott: Oh, okay.

984
00:48:58,237 --> 00:48:58,925
Rym: It's really nice.

985
00:48:59,106 --> 00:48:59,410
Scott: Not bad.

986
00:48:59,751 --> 00:49:10,702
Rym: The main big unit, however, removes so much humidity that it also has a pump that'll pump it out of this little tube and it'll pump it, you know, you can put it up into the ceiling over and down.

987
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:11,310
Scott: Into a drain?

988
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:11,857
Rym: Into a drain.

989
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:12,510
Scott: Yeah, okay.

990
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,238
Scott: Yeah, drain is good.

991
00:49:14,258 --> 00:49:16,070
Scott: You send like a tiny hose to the bathroom.

992
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:16,735
Rym: Exactly.

993
00:49:16,816 --> 00:49:17,302
Rym: So we did that.

994
00:49:17,343 --> 00:49:18,255
Rym: That was already set up.

995
00:49:18,315 --> 00:49:19,430
Rym: It went through the ceiling, it was fine.

996
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,369
Rym: So I got another S&P trap one day.

997
00:49:22,653 --> 00:49:26,358
Rym: Water pan full and I go in there and the floor is just fucking flooded.

998
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:27,609
Scott: How could that be?

999
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:29,813
Scott: Where did the humidity come from?

1000
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:31,149
Scott: Did someone like pee in it?

1001
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,850
Rym: Well, this was during the height of summer.

1002
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:37,750
Rym: So, basically, I do a little experimentation.

1003
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:38,781
Rym: I look at this tube and I'm like,

1004
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:39,064
Rym: "Huh.".

1005
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,170
Rym: This tube goes into the ceiling and comes down.

1006
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:46,945
Rym: I found an air duster and I stuck it into the tube and I blew and it was 100% clogged.

1007
00:49:47,227 --> 00:49:48,681
Scott: Oh, that little hose got clogged.

1008
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:50,055
Rym: So I ripped it out of the ceiling.

1009
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:52,649
Rym: It was full of the most mold.

1010
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:54,539
Rym: All the mold.

1011
00:49:55,064 --> 00:49:55,893
Scott: So you got a new hose?

1012
00:49:55,933 --> 00:49:57,790
Rym: So I ordered a new hose on Amazon.

1013
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:58,897
Rym: It came the next day.

1014
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:00,257
Scott: What did you do before the hose showed up?

1015
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,702
Scott: Was it just more water everywhere or did you turn the servers off?

1016
00:50:02,843 --> 00:50:06,439
Rym: Oh, so if you unplug the thing, it knows "Oh, I can't

1017
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:06,681
Rym: pump.".

1018
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,570
Rym: So it just holds it until it gets full while evaporating.

1019
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:10,842
Scott: So you just emptied the bucket by hand?

1020
00:50:11,226 --> 00:50:14,580
Rym: So I emptied it once and then it was fine until I got a new hose.

1021
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:14,943
Rym: Okay.

1022
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:17,267
Rym: And then I put a new hose on and it was fine.

1023
00:50:17,428 --> 00:50:17,610
Rym: Cool.

1024
00:50:18,196 --> 00:50:20,599
Rym: But most people wouldn't think to actually check the hose.

1025
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,740
Scott: I would not have checked the hose for clogs.

1026
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:23,750
Rym: That's the first thing you do.

1027
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:31,310
Scott: I would have gone to the other end of the hose and if I saw nothing coming out, maybe because I would have definitely checked the end of the hose to make sure water was coming out.

1028
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:39,067
Rym: Now, had the connector been broken or something, or the hose had been clogged in a certain way, it would have detected it.

1029
00:50:39,671 --> 00:50:43,730
Rym: But it basically pumped the water out but then the hose was busted.

1030
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:47,190
Rym: so then it would squeeze its way back out the bottom of the hose and leak.

1031
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:49,689
Rym: So learn how those hoses work.

1032
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:50,878
Rym: Read the manual.

1033
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:57,366
Rym: The manual will say something like, "The hose has a maximum lift of x and the hose diameter has to be...".

1034
00:50:57,386 --> 00:50:59,083
Rym: It'll tell you all this stuff in the manual.

1035
00:50:59,124 --> 00:50:59,710
Rym: Read that manual.

1036
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,599
Scott: It's like a garden hose?

1037
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:01,831
Rym: No, like a tiny hose.

1038
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:04,700
Rym: The hose is like two or three millimeters.

1039
00:51:05,305 --> 00:51:05,790
Rym: Oh my god.

1040
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,328
Rym: If it was a garden hose that was clogged, what the fuck?

1041
00:51:10,594 --> 00:51:11,504
Rym: So here's my problem.

1042
00:51:11,565 --> 00:51:13,689
Rym: The unit, that unit eventually died.

1043
00:51:14,774 --> 00:51:16,964
Scott: So you had to just turn all the servers off until you got a new one?

1044
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:20,196
Rym: No, because I had bought a backup unit a long time ago.

1045
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:21,369
Rym: Nah, there you go.

1046
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:26,135
Rym: The backup unit is just a two-hose like what Alex has, a normal air conditioner.

1047
00:51:26,155 --> 00:51:28,035
Scott: Oh, so you basically got a crappy one.

1048
00:51:28,197 --> 00:51:35,289
Rym: And I put it in the room and I set its temperature to like 80 with the fan always going and I put it in front of the rack.

1049
00:51:36,213 --> 00:51:41,529
Rym: So that if anything went wrong, it'll at least be blowing cold air directly over the servers to keep them fine.

1050
00:51:42,398 --> 00:51:52,598
Rym: And it turns out, because that old unit had been a legacy unit, that this backup unit was more than capable of keeping the entire room and all the servers cool on its own.

1051
00:51:53,285 --> 00:51:55,024
Rym: That other unit was way over provisioned.

1052
00:51:55,085 --> 00:51:56,055
Rym: So I just didn't replace it.

1053
00:51:56,357 --> 00:51:56,660
Scott: Okay.

1054
00:51:57,407 --> 00:52:00,074
Rym: The moral is learn this stuff and kind of just wing it.

1055
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:07,772
Rym: And I think if you remember all the problems I ran into from this episode, you're unlikely to run into different problems from that.

1056
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,230
Scott: You will definitely run into a different problem.

1057
00:52:09,432 --> 00:52:20,178
Scott: But one thing you can do that's an option for the small server room that is often unexplored is to completely seal the server rack in and air condition just that box.

1058
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:20,703
Rym: Yup.

1059
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:22,665
Rym: And do it all ghetto with cardboard boxes.

1060
00:52:22,746 --> 00:52:23,150
Rym: Exactly.

1061
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:28,501
Scott: If your room is no good and you can't get a good room, just seal the servers in somehow.

1062
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,390
Scott: Make it an airtight.

1063
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:29,997
Scott: seal around.

1064
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:31,090
Scott: Doesn't need to be super airtight.

1065
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,988
Scott: Just as airtight as your PC case is.

1066
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:33,672
Scott: Right?

1067
00:52:33,854 --> 00:52:35,350
Scott: Just around all the servers.

1068
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,098
Scott: Even just a door on the front and back of the rack or something.

1069
00:52:38,563 --> 00:52:42,989
Scott: And then you can just use fans and just maybe an air conditioner connected just to that.

1070
00:52:43,554 --> 00:52:44,888
Scott: And that'll just take care of everything.

1071
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:50,970
Scott: And though the room might be hot or the office or whatever, but at least the servers will never screw up or anything.

1072
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:57,109
Rym: But if you run into a problem that I didn't cover, really if your job is to fix this kind of thing.

1073
00:52:57,352 --> 00:52:59,897
Scott: A rat bit the hose that the water was going through.

1074
00:52:59,917 --> 00:53:07,918
Rym: Just go look and apply the same problem solving skills you apply to software and networks to the physical device.

1075
00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:10,628
Rym: Being a handyman, it's not like it's magic knowledge or being an HVAC.

1076
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:11,636
Rym: It's not magic.

1077
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,333
Rym: It's just look at the problem.

1078
00:53:13,636 --> 00:53:14,181
Rym: Huh?

1079
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:18,404
Scott: Yeah, HVAC guy unless he owns his own HVAC business makes less money than we do.

1080
00:53:18,424 --> 00:53:20,830
Scott: It's because his skills are not that special.

1081
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,283
Scott: It's something you can learn.

1082
00:53:22,344 --> 00:53:26,808
Rym: Well, the skill so the higher order skills are special, like figuring out the air pressure differentials.

1083
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:30,507
Scott: I'm talking about HVAC guy who like, you know, installs your central air conditioner outside your house.

1084
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:30,729
Scott: Yeah.

1085
00:53:30,971 --> 00:53:31,233
Scott: Right?

1086
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,555
Scott: It's like I could learn to do that if I pick one up.

1087
00:53:34,686 --> 00:53:36,969
Rym: But just apply basic problem solving skills.

1088
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:38,381
Rym: This stuff's easy to fix.

1089
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:49,513
Rym: And if you're an IT guy and you just fix these problems as the intern and it all just starts working perfectly, people will think that you're the most ridiculously competent IT guy ever.

1090
00:53:49,554 --> 00:53:50,079
Rym: And you're set.

1091
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:56,040
Scott: Well, also, even if they don't think highly of you, they will might hate you because you have shamed them.

1092
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,678
Scott: It's like they had that door open all that time and you're like, Look, I shut the door.

1093
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,182
Rym: Yeah.

1094
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:00,950
Rym: Don't call attention.

1095
00:54:02,257 --> 00:54:02,908
Scott: Oh, you're stupid.

1096
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,140
Rym: Don't be stupid.

1097
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,323
Rym: Don't be like a closed motherfucking door.

1098
00:54:06,363 --> 00:54:08,262
Rym: Just be like, I fixed it and don't say anything else.

1099
00:54:08,626 --> 00:54:09,919
Rym: It's like I got the rooms fine.

1100
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:10,827
Rym: It's all taken care of.

1101
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:17,415
Rym: And that's the kind of stuff you have to be able to do, especially if you someday work for a small company or a non tech company.

1102
00:54:17,435 --> 00:54:18,268
Rym: But you're the tech guy.

1103
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:21,636
Rym: Tech guy also has to deal with electrical problems.

1104
00:54:21,879 --> 00:54:26,730
Rym: Tech guy also has to deal with air conditioners and water pipes and all that stuff.

1105
00:54:27,191 --> 00:54:28,161
Scott: Everything tech guy.

1106
00:54:28,262 --> 00:54:32,449
Rym: If you're the tech guy for a non tech company, you're gonna have to deal with all that stuff.

1107
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,007
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1108
00:54:39,048 --> 00:54:44,020
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1109
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:49,470

1110
00:54:49,712 --> 00:54:52,359
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1111
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,620

00:55:00,442 --> 00:55:04,987
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1114
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:08,060
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
