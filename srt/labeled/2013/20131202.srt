1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,926
Rym: It's Monday December 2nd 2013.

2
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:12,350
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:15,057
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:16,059
Rym: We're back tonight.

5
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:19,478
Rym: We're talking about that penny arcade job posting rims.

6
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:19,719
Scott: I did.

7
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:27,905
Rym: Let's do this Now.

8
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:33,290
Rym: I should note we're gonna try to avoid talking about any of the non tech aspects of because they're obvious.

9
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:34,716
Rym: Yeah, they're obvious.

10
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:37,989
Scott: the way you shouldn't work zillion hours a week.

11
00:00:38,692 --> 00:00:45,713
Rym: Yeah, well the only exception would be if work is also life, but That's a sad person.

12
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:46,234
Rym: Well.

13
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:46,716
Rym: Well.

14
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:46,996
Rym: What if?

15
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:47,237
Rym: what?

16
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:55,602
Rym: if my job Scott mm-hmm is to hang out on the beach and relax I'm putting in extra hours for that job.

17
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,950
Scott: I'm gonna murder you and take your job.

18
00:00:57,171 --> 00:01:02,070
Scott: Yeah, so but in that case or you're gonna put in a good word for me And I'll get hired and you'll get as high signing bonus.

19
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:11,770
Rym: I mean I spent a lot of late nights working on GeekNights when I could have been asleep Back in the day when it would take us a couple hours to actually put a show together after we recorded it.

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:21,222
Rym: But I digress that's in the second part of the show, but yeah, I was in Istanbul all last week Ironically in Turkey over Thanksgiving, so I did not have any turkey.

21
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:22,506
Scott: is that really ironic?

22
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:24,634
Rym: uh no It's ironic.

23
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:42,550
Rym: That's why I said ironic with an ironic lilt perhaps but Nobody who everyone I talked to who knew that I was gonna be in Turkey over Thanksgiving Had to basically make some Observation along those lines of ah you're gonna be what?

24
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,286
Scott: Instead of having been the turkey what three times now?

25
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:47,653
Scott: more than that I mean the turkey.

26
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:51,910
Scott: the Turkish people know that the name of their country in English is the name of a bird.

27
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:55,164
Rym: I so so right let us know that they do.

28
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:56,590
Scott: and what do they think about that?

29
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:58,434
Rym: They don't think about it.

30
00:01:58,735 --> 00:01:58,996
Scott: Okay.

31
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:03,790
Rym: They do eat turkeys on Christmas, which they celebrate even though they call it turkey.

32
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:07,041
Rym: I don't know because everyone I do business where.

33
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:08,366
Scott: what is the Arabic word for Turkey?

34
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:09,630
Rym: so they don't speak Arabic.

35
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,693
Scott: I thought they speak it up.

36
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:12,261
Rym: They speak Turkish.

37
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:12,682
Scott: I didn't know.

38
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:13,787
Scott: Turkish is a different language.

39
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:15,411
Scott: Wow What's that?

40
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:16,032
Scott: was it different?

41
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:18,095
Rym: It's completely different.

42
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:22,614
Rym: It's more based on Greek than it is based on Anything else.

43
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:23,537
Scott: did not know this?

44
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,284
Rym: Wow really okay?

45
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:26,950
Rym: You listen to 12 Byzantine rulers.

46
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,837
Rym: Yeah, you don't know.

47
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:30,242
Scott: how much do you think I remember?

48
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,025
Scott: I can't remember.

49
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:32,190
Scott: I can't remember anything all right.

50
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,220
Rym: So so a few highlights.

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:45,981
Rym: then I saw the chain As in that chain from that podcast the one that hung across the Bosphorus that kept the Ottomans at bay Until they eventually took the tower and took it down.

52
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:51,226
Rym: the chain is just there in the museum Mm-hmm, and I think the funniest thing was.

53
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:55,294
Rym: I saw all these Egyptian Artifacts and for a second.

54
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:55,956
Rym: I'm like what?

55
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:57,460
Rym: why is there so much Egypt?

56
00:02:57,862 --> 00:03:02,569
Rym: Oh right Romans conquered Egypt Greeks conquered Egypt, this is all

57
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,634
Scott: Cleopatra

58
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:20,038
Rym: yeah, and I think older stuff yeah lot a lot of the artifacts that Rome and Parts of Rome have laying around like in their museums today are things that the Romans themselves looted from places They conquered more than a thousand years ago.

59
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:36,624
Rym: These are things that were conquered taken looted and put in museums Before so-called Jesus wasn't born mm-hmm I just find that awesome and interesting, but now that my trouble with Turkey is that I Would like to learn Turkish because I go there enough and the business is big, but

60
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:37,828
Scott: they mostly speak English.

61
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,041
Rym: well Let's be everyone in the industry.

62
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:44,886
Rym: I engage with speaks English Pretty well too very well too better than a lot of Americans.

63
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:45,589
Scott: hello my friend.

64
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:49,470
Rym: I want a lot of people in the street at least in the urban centers also speak English.

65
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,096
Rym: So as a result I don't have any chance to really use.

66
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,863
Scott: do they speak English even to each other?

67
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:57,499
Scott: or only they are able to speak English But don't speak it as their primary language.

68
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,730
Rym: They will never speak English to each other, okay?

69
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,349
Rym: But they speak it very well when they're speaking with me or when I'm in the room.

70
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,686
Rym: but All the books I can find to teach myself Turkish are ancient and teach like Turkish from the 1920s like no one.

71
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,601
Scott: Why don't you get ripoff Rosetta Stone?

72
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:17,870
Rym: Yeah, so I'm probably going to pirate Rosetta Stone.

73
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:24,030
Scott: Why don't you do the thing that Emily does with the Skype and with the Turkish person because that service did not have Turkish?

74
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:31,892
Rym: Really there are not a lot of English to Turkish language resources because there's not a lot of interest in the English-speaking world and learning Turkish.

75
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:34,869
Scott: sadly why don't you find the person who is like?

76
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,408
Scott: Translating Turkish books or something and ask them if there's something you can do?

77
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,690
Rym: yeah I'll just pay them to come over and teach me Turkish.

78
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:52,308
Scott: I mean like go to the Turkish bookstore right and find like the most popular fucking book right and it's probably gonna be have an English translation look up in the credits who did the translation and then find the person on the internet and call them.

79
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,210
Rym: well I think I'm gonna probably start by pirating Rosetta Stone, and I'm still doing some research.

80
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:58,420
Rym: I found a couple of books.

81
00:04:58,582 --> 00:04:59,510
Rym: the problem is the books.

82
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,064
Scott: Why don't you look at the person in the credits of the Turkish Rosetta Stone who made it?

83
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:04,429
Rym: Oh?

84
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,189
Scott: maybe Those people may probably just tell you to use Turkish Rosetta Stone, but still.

85
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:19,352
Rym: But I I only learn words related to food and coffee because they have coffee and tea and stuff like that Constantly.

86
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:20,235
Rym: it's awesome.

87
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:23,063
Scott: usually the first thing people learn is when they're learning a new language.

88
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,090
Scott: late in life is swear words.

89
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,579
Scott: Yeah, but you probably haven't learned any.

90
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,543
Rym: nope I haven't learned any.

91
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,145
Rym: I've overheard.

92
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:31,575
Rym: I think what you say We're lucky in Turkey.

93
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:32,721
Rym: nope I can.

94
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:37,784
Rym: I can order a Black Turkish coffee by getting saute coffee.

95
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:39,270
Rym: okay as opposed to art.

96
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,810
Rym: Oh coffee, which is Turkish coffee with a little bit of sugar in it and the word for tea is chai.

97
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:45,623
Scott: Oh, that's a hard word.

98
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:46,510
Rym: It's spelled differently.

99
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,299
Rym: It's spelled C a y but I can read Turkish.

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:57,256
Rym: I can read Turkish words and know how to pronounce them Which actually took me a little while to figure out I could do that with Hebrew and I was like in kindergarten.

101
00:05:57,276 --> 00:06:04,012
Rym: they use a lot of Diocratics like way more than I'm used to and they have a much bigger impact on the words Like.

102
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:09,350
Rym: also the most vexing thing is that there's I with a dot and without a dot and they're different.

103
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:12,909
Rym: So they're gonna be an uppercase I with a dot and uppercase I without a dot.

104
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:18,570
Rym: All right, yeah that also causes problems in Java and other languages if you don't handle it properly.

105
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:19,413
Rym: Mm-hmm.

106
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:28,149
Rym: because there's a lowercase I with the dot so it gets uppercase to do an uppercase Dotted I. that doesn't display in most Western character sets.

107
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:29,758
Rym: Thus problems.

108
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:33,475
Rym: text editor you TFA yeah But even then which character?

109
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:33,857
Rym: if you have?

110
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:39,608
Rym: if you type an I that's a lowercase I in English It'll have the dot by default mm-hmm.

111
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:56,870
Rym: So if you if you take that in Turkish and then uppercase it it'll still have the dot Mm-hmm, but you don't want the dotted uppercase I. in that case most likely You want the non dotted uppercase I especially if it's English just being typed in Turkish.

112
00:06:58,396 --> 00:06:59,009
Rym: There's also issues.

113
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,615
Scott: That's the problem.

114
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:07,746
Scott: is someone on a Turkish keyboard put in their Turkish lowercase I when they meant to put in an English lowercase I yep, or the other way around.

115
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:14,930
Rym: you put in English lowercase I. that gets uppercase to a uppercase I with a dot which doesn't exist in English.

116
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,196
Scott: It's a different letter right.

117
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:21,818
Scott: you just pretend it like that lowercase Turkish I ah but this is the problem in English.

118
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:22,379
Rym: we have.

119
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,009
Rym: we have lowercase I with a dot and uppercase I without a dot.

120
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:27,255
Rym: So we have.

121
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:30,270
Rym: we have like half and a half is our problem anyway.

122
00:07:31,313 --> 00:07:32,723
Rym: but yeah, that that's how I was in Turkey.

123
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:39,295
Rym: it was awesome and Lions won the Thanksgiving Day game The first time.

124
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:42,244
Rym: it doesn't my life that I can remember that I cared.

125
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:45,174
Rym: it doesn't matter matters a lot Matters a lot.

126
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:49,589
Rym: if I if you're you know if you've ever lived in Detroit it matters a lot doesn't matter.

127
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:53,844
Rym: Anyway, so we got some news got a news got news.

128
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:54,326
Rym: We're back.

129
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:55,209
Rym: It's GeekNights news.

130
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:58,199
Scott: I think I closed my tab with my news.

131
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:05,029
Scott: Let me remember was all right, so RMS as In Richard Stallman why are we talking about him?

132
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:12,975
Rym: So I decided that he's the opposite of relevant has proven that Bitcoin has made it and you know how we know.

133
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:18,810
Rym: Bitcoin has made it because Richard Stallman is calling for an anonymous alternative to Bitcoin.

134
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:24,382
Rym: Okay He doesn't tell anyone how or doesn't know how?

135
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:42,089
Rym: of course not but basically Bitcoin has become useful enough to where he is calling for an alternative to it Because of its flaw the flaw being that it's not actually anonymous Which is funny because most people who talk about Bitcoin seem to laud how anonymous it is not knowing that it's actually the opposite of that.

136
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:45,470
Rym: And the point of it is not that it's anonymous, but that it's intrinsic.

137
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:54,511
Rym: This article just if you want to see what slash shot looked like in 1994 this article from today is basically slashed out in 1994.

138
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:59,294
Rym: It's got all the keywords RMS alternative to whatever hot technology They take.

139
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:01,009
Scott: your Bill Gates face with the Borg on it.

140
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:07,735
Rym: It's actually got a picture of a Bitcoin because they have a Bitcoin category because there's so many articles about Now.

141
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:31,538
Rym: Maybe we do need an anonymous equivalent of Bitcoin because cash is increasingly difficult to use by tech nerdy people and And Intrinsic currencies are useful for the segment of the population that can't use credit cards aka Teenagers who are increasingly spending a lot of money online and have no good way to do that.

142
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:39,280
Rym: Mm-hmm Anonymous ones would be good for the black market the internet underground buying drugs.

143
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:49,999
Rym: Bitcoin is kind of good for that too, but you have to be technologically savvy Mm-hmm, but now my real news is that Amazon announced the kind of thing that's usually a Don't know April Fool's joke.

144
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:53,975
Scott: I thought it was an April Fool's joke at first or a parody and I had heard.

145
00:09:54,015 --> 00:10:21,479
Rym: I mean there have been rumors about this For a long time and I assume this is the kind of thing that you'd see on One of those TV shows back when they were like what's new in tech with Soledad O'Brien on TV back in the day like square Whatever TV, but I forget what all those channels were called but Amazon actually announced that they're gonna have little drones that will deliver packages and They actually have come a long way and they've got working prototypes like this is not as far away as people think it is.

146
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:24,168
Scott: I just see like two things.

147
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,955
Scott: I'm seeing really often lately, right?

148
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:35,100
Scott: The one thing is Where people like they misunderstand where technology currently is in both directions, right?

149
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:44,126
Scott: It's like they'll underestimate what they're capable of doing right now realistically and they'll also overestimate in different areas Point Google Glass.

150
00:10:44,468 --> 00:11:01,640
Rym: people think it's like this real-world overlay Device that shows you this heads-up display that fully fills your vision like yeah people do have no under no realistic Understanding of what it actually does right, but then they don't realize that robot cars already work like they already work.

151
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,526
Rym: Yeah, they exist.

152
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:16,793
Scott: they work for real in real cities but and and the thing is in either direction right the over or underestimating people have a completely unrealistic Expectation about timeframes as well, right?

153
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:21,691
Scott: It's like when they underestimate They think you know, the thing is actually way old.

154
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:23,520
Scott: It's like yeah, I've been doing that for like a hundred years.

155
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,664
Scott: Where have you been right?

156
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:28,720
Rym: Well, like when Facebook come up, you're like, wow, this is the first thing like that ever.

157
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,747
Rym: It's like yeah Never mind ICQ and orca.

158
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:37,000
Scott: and then when they overestimate it's like, you know, they think it's gonna be right around the corner.

159
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,912
Scott: It's like no, that's you're not, you know, we've been talking cars, right?

160
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:40,836
Scott: It's like we've been talking about.

161
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:41,940
Scott: it's like Google Glass, right?

162
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,096
Scott: Yeah, it's here, right?

163
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,444
Scott: You're overestimating what it's capable of But you think it's.

164
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,954
Scott: you know, even if you get that right you think it's good.

165
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,540
Scott: You're gonna be capable of it like really soon.

166
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,442
Rym: It's like no not anytime soon, but at the same time they really underestimate that what glass is Right.

167
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:58,326
Rym: He much already exists.

168
00:11:58,346 --> 00:11:59,230
Rym: They say be out soon.

169
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:09,693
Scott: the whole world just has this, you know Anyone who's not in technology has a completely Wrong understanding of where we are at and what things can do and including right.

170
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:17,815
Scott: this news story is the perfect example because even 60 minutes a very reputable news program right is acting all like this.

171
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,379
Scott: shits like around the corner.

172
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:23,360
Rym: no nerds We're talking about this back when Amazon started sure.

173
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,667
Scott: But the other thing is like when is this actually?

174
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:29,720
Scott: realistically when I'm what day am I going to receive a package by Amazon?

175
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,613
Scott: by air like this.

176
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:35,973
Scott: Five years minimum more like ten.

177
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:40,189
Rym: I think this brings up the Fundamental underlying point.

178
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:50,780
Rym: I'm glad that you went in this direction The biggest problem in technology, but they have a news story like if we're gonna have this today just because we can theoretically Yeah, well, I mean that's the people are acting like this is some crazy thing.

179
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,249
Rym: No, this is this.

180
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:54,020
Rym: technology has existed for a while.

181
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:58,016
Rym: It's not new Amazon saying they're going to do and then they go.

182
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,443
Scott: Oh my god U.m.

183
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:00,207
Scott: Play gods.

184
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:01,896
Scott: a package is gonna fall on someone and kill him.

185
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:07,051
Rym: Yeah But the it's the same thing is with robot cars.

186
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:09,116
Rym: that technology exists today.

187
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:14,892
Rym: It is not Technologically infeasible to roll it out assuming no concerns.

188
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:15,333
Scott: It might.

189
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:19,624
Scott: I can be economically infeasible In mass.

190
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:22,817
Scott: in mass you can definitely deliver one package for sure.

191
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:30,291
Rym: No problem It would depend on where this would be the most feasible in a place like New York City Sure, where it could just deliver.

192
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:37,936
Rym: It doesn't have to go very far But there's a lot of people that can deliver to Exactly and you could get to the places that are difficult to get delivery trucks to.

193
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:38,920
Scott: but how is it gonna?

194
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,399
Scott: How are you gonna for anyone from robbing it?

195
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:47,227
Scott: I'm not worried about that because those are the kinds of things I would just stand look around for them Shoot them down and take whatever they got.

196
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:58,320
Scott: especially I would use my binoculars a scope and if it's a new egg, boom If it's right if it can that hard drive will make the it'll survive the descent fireman person catching that.

197
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:00,718
Rym: I have a feeling that that is.

198
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:03,611
Rym: you know This is something you're doing the thing that people on slashdot did.

199
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:07,759
Rym: they do all the time whenever there's an article about hey We're gonna make a subway that goes in space.

200
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:15,060
Rym: The first comments are armchair engineers saying yeah, but because of the whatever radiation it couldn't actually work.

201
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,159
Rym: It's like dumb shits if the engineers are working on it.

202
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:24,076
Rym: They probably thought of the most low hanging fruit dangers that you think of my gogo 13 attack.

203
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:28,327
Rym: You know what if gogo 13 attacks that it's fucked.

204
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:33,260
Rym: that's what I'm saying, that's fine if gogo 13 attacks a tank tanks fucked.

205
00:14:33,463 --> 00:14:34,219
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

206
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:47,786
Rym: but in terms of this the biggest problem with technology today in terms of rolling it out is the gap between government regulation and technological availability and Fear of people.

207
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:52,205
Rym: Yeah, but the fear of people kind of ties in that Technology exists today to do this.

208
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:55,956
Rym: Amazon could start doing this on a small scale today.

209
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:59,986
Rym: There is literally no Technological limitation preventing them from doing so.

210
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:03,255
Rym: just like we could have robot cars give you windy driving.

211
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:04,940
Rym: Well, then it doesn't go until the next day.

212
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:08,839
Rym: So yes today or tomorrow, you're never getting deliveries.

213
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:17,569
Rym: Well, then they do some sort of blimp thing instead where a blimp goes up rides the wind and then lands and then someone just Goes around later and picks up all the blimps like once a month.

214
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:23,751
Scott: I Military's been doing that for like as long as we've had planes.

215
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:24,274
Rym: Yep.

216
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:25,620
Rym: You think the military doesn't.

217
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:29,802
Scott: They can deliver stuff wouldn't create with a parachute old Invention.

218
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:38,749
Rym: if the military can deliver a Hellfire missile into someone's living room whenever they want via a drone They can deliver a package with some hard drives and a USB cable.

219
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,419
Rym: Yep, if they did it via missile, that'd be pretty cool, dude.

220
00:15:44,381 --> 00:16:02,740
Rym: But seriously the only reason we don't have limited trials of Commercially available robot cars or things like this is simply that our government is and on any level on the local level the national level The federal level state level town level old people 100% incapable of even discussing these issues.

221
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:10,280
Rym: Do you know how will New York City as a specific example even get to the point where anyone involved in our government?

222
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:17,300
Rym: Even begins to understand how to go about regulating private drones using New York City's airspace?

223
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:23,980
Scott: They're still discussing whether to put like a traffic slowing curb in my neighborhood.

224
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:31,838
Rym: They're already fighting whether they're already realizing that because of state laws They can't reduce the speed limit to 20 miles an hour because there's state laws that prevent it.

225
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:39,504
Rym: So we have a problem where increasingly and I think this is going to happen more and more within the next 10 years We're gonna hit a crisis point with this.

226
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:44,740
Rym: technology is advancing so fast that we will have things that are so just start.

227
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:59,849
Scott: I think that right and this is why what you see in Silicon Valley so much is These companies sort of jerkily right in most cases just start deploying their technology in direct Scoffing and violation of any laws and regulations.

228
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,756
Rym: a crunchy roll did that back in the day, right?

229
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,000
Scott: Exactly like uber.

230
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:04,440
Scott: They're just like fuck your taxi laws.

231
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,711
Scott: We're doing it and they just do it and it's like what do you do?

232
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,146
Scott: stop us and they do try to stop them By forcing the battle.

233
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:15,300
Scott: that's the only way to actually make anything happen is by just starting to do it.

234
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,146
Scott: So if I was Amazon They have plenty of fucking money.

235
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:25,000
Scott: if you got this shit to the point where it worked and you were ready to make it happen Just start doing it, right?

236
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,620
Scott: Just do it and make the guard and force the government to discuss it and do something about it.

237
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,703
Scott: Force them to shoot down your little drones or do whatever because this is the only way you're actually gonna be able to get it Set up.

238
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:38,946
Rym: I do a little more subtle and a little more 80s movie villain.

239
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:44,134
Rym: I would find a small town that Really needed it that really needed me.

240
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:45,360
Scott: the post office never goes there.

241
00:17:45,551 --> 00:18:00,225
Rym: Yeah like one of those small towns and I would work with them and get them to pass all the local laws that would make it Work and tell them don't worry about federal and state bullshit because we got your back and then just deploy in that town and then as soon as there's trouble and the government gets involved.

242
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:09,813
Rym: suddenly you've got a government fighting with you not just individual people and Neighboring towns, there'll be people who want these things and you could.

243
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:11,840
Rym: you could just dump lobbying money into.

244
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:13,128
Scott: You think people would.

245
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,000
Scott: actually the problem is in the small town.

246
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,703
Scott: No one will want them.

247
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:17,230
Scott: you have to do in the city where people.

248
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,860
Rym: you gotta find the small city like this like the Silicon Valley like mini like these little cities that have a bunch of tech workers.

249
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:26,940
Rym: Anyway, like Raleigh would be possibly a good place for something like that.

250
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,017
Rym: A lot of tech workers despite being a relatively small city on the grand scheme of things.

251
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,622
Scott: All right News.

252
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:35,532
Scott: so this isn't really news, right?

253
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,100
Scott: It's just something I always had troubles with.

254
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,234
Scott: Alright, you know, I'm pretty good at setting up computers and whatnot.

255
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:51,472
Rym: Yep, but mail servers Nope, you know, nope, you know the last time I set up a mail server Well one Scott and I try to get squirrel mail working at RIT.

256
00:18:51,873 --> 00:18:52,175
Scott: I did.

257
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:53,400
Scott: Yeah some point it did.

258
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:54,606
Rym: It technically works.

259
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:57,198
Scott: Who knows if I was spamming or whatever, but yeah.

260
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:05,400
Scott: So anyway There's a website here at flirty calm and it's how do you set up a mail server on a new slash Linux system?

261
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,850
Scott: Step by step guide you install post fix.

262
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,740
Scott: it would do plus post fix plus courier.

263
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:13,752
Scott: I'm at plus my SQL plus mf as the new plus spam assassin.

264
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:21,505
Scott: plus clamor plus sazzle plus telus plus around cube plus post gray, it tells you how to set up every Single piece.

265
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:27,525
Scott: I wish they would just give you a fucking CD where it was set up already and when the CD turns on You type in your domain.

266
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:31,299
Scott: it gives you the MX records you paste them and you push go and it's set up.

267
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:35,540
Scott: That's what they should make and maybe I can make that from these instructions.

268
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:37,516
Rym: Maybe and then make it a virtual image.

269
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:37,980
Scott: just make it.

270
00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:45,412
Rym: Make it an AMI so you can just boom your email on Amazon with a little back door to where years from now You can use it to take over all these networks.

271
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:48,466
Scott: Yeah, great Take over your emails.

272
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,270
Rym: No, seriously.

273
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:51,100
Rym: I mean your job at least is programming.

274
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,335
Rym: So it's understandable that you would not have deep expertise on email server administration.

275
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:57,920
Scott: I can administer any other kind of sir.

276
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,410
Rym: Yeah, my job was IT.

277
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:01,716
Rym: My career was IT.

278
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:02,660
Rym: My degree is in IT.

279
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,236
Rym: I am no more capable of getting email servers working than Scott is.

280
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:06,980
Scott: I'm very capable.

281
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:08,080
Scott: I read these instructions.

282
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:22,819
Rym: Yeah but the last time I set up email to work was like one of my capstone projects at RIT in system administration - Hmm I had to set up an email server a Wins server which already is starting to date me.

283
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:33,019
Rym: So anyway things of the day Little video game thing of the day here.

284
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:34,990
Rym: Uh, Scott was not aware of these differences.

285
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:36,238
Scott: I was not aware at all.

286
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:36,520
Rym: Now.

287
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,010
Scott: I don't know what to do with my life.

288
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:40,521
Rym: I was aware of some of the everything I knew is wrong.

289
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:42,710
Rym: My worldview is shattered, but not all of them.

290
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:56,365
Rym: So there's a history of Japanese Nintendo games being way harder than the American equivalents because Japan has a Final Fantasy 4 1 Mega Man 2 having the easy mode which doesn't exist.

291
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,390
Rym: Final Fantasy 6 Yeah.

292
00:20:59,012 --> 00:21:00,155
Scott: So every game.

293
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:05,289
Rym: pretty much Japan had a very low opinion of the intelligence of the average American gamer.

294
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,792
Rym: not Unfounded.

295
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:09,503
Rym: they also had a very low opinion.

296
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:11,230
Scott: or was it a self-fulfilling prophecy?

297
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:15,370
Scott: Maybe if they had given us the real Mario 3 and such then we would be better at games.

298
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:16,272
Rym: Maybe.

299
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:23,007
Rym: but at the same time maybe they rightfully assumed that Americans would give up in frustration rather than rising to the challenge.

300
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,567
Rym: I Don't know because I played Final Fantasy 4j and I came as fucking hard.

301
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:40,174
Rym: Yeah Anyway, so this is a complete enumeration to the best of my knowledge of all the differences between the United States release and the Japanese release of Super Mario Brothers 3.

302
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,370
Scott: Some I thought they were identical.

303
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:43,155
Rym: Yeah, some of the differences are subtle.

304
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:45,322
Rym: like there's some graphical changes.

305
00:21:45,342 --> 00:21:48,010
Rym: like the throne rooms are just different for no reason.

306
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:49,764
Scott: Yeah, probably for memory reasons.

307
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:50,350
Scott: It's an NES.

308
00:21:50,691 --> 00:22:05,516
Rym: Uh, there's a door that's in a different place because it's harder if the doors in that's play in that place in Japanese only slightly and I wouldn't die there in American Mario 3. if you have say the fire flower and you get hit you turn into big Mario You get hit again.

309
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:07,005
Rym: turn into small Mario get hit again.

310
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:11,880
Rym: you die in Japanese Mario 3 just like every other Mario.

311
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,270
Rym: if you're fire flower and you get hit small Mario hit again dead.

312
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,364
Scott: It's Super Mario world different between Japan and us.

313
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:20,894
Rym: I'm Not sure.

314
00:22:20,914 --> 00:22:22,442
Rym: I don't know.

315
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:28,250
Rym: actually I Only knew about Mario 3 because of Nintendo power features and a lot of research as a kid.

316
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:30,841
Rym: Okay, but there were some things like this crazy glitch.

317
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,870
Rym: I did not know about with a fourth warp whistle.

318
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:35,162
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what the hell that is.

319
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:39,109
Rym: Yeah It's weird that they changed like that end to like.

320
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,324
Rym: Maybe they just realized at the end of this cuz level 5 was kind of glitchy.

321
00:22:43,344 --> 00:22:47,762
Rym: in general you get the impression that it was The rushed one and they cut a lot out at the last minute.

322
00:22:48,123 --> 00:22:51,353
Rym: and I feel like oh, yeah I don't know.

323
00:22:52,015 --> 00:22:55,289
Rym: sky world had the most weird glitches that currybows shoe just kind of hanging out.

324
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:58,406
Scott: That's not doesn't sound like something that you just sort of you know.

325
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,035
Scott: Spit out quickly, right?

326
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:04,290
Scott: They put a lot of work in a curry bow shoe and also that tower where you go up and down.

327
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:10,995
Rym: They did but I feel like because that's our sky world always felt kind of different from all the other parts of Mario 3.

328
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:12,486
Rym: Anyway, we can talk about that on a Tuesday.

329
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:16,537
Scott: Yeah Alright, so another thing of the day.

330
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:18,082
Scott: This is just a YouTube channel.

331
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:19,505
Scott: Not a specific YouTube video.

332
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,210
Scott: I found out about this.

333
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:33,949
Scott: There's a YouTube channel KBS world TV and KBS is just a Korean TV stations one of the biggest ones and They just put a whole bunch of shit on YouTube with subtitles legit totally legit full HD.

334
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,527
Scott: Whatever who like constantly like all like you just watch their dramas.

335
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:39,410
Scott: You can watch your whatever.

336
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:45,050
Scott: It's just all on there and it's like whoa, how come like other TV channels don't do this.

337
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,514
Scott: How come I?

338
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:52,830
Scott: you know, it's like yeah, obviously You know the Koreans pretty good at spreading their culture on the Internet's better than the other countries.

339
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:54,842
Scott: But you know, how come there isn't like.

340
00:23:54,903 --> 00:24:01,030
Scott: I don't know the French Broadcast network putting their shows up on it, you know, the BBC does it with their stupid?

341
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:05,190
Scott: I player you can only watch if you have a VPN or live there or what, right?

342
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,181
Scott: It's like everyone is getting this wrong here.

343
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:10,549
Scott: is there is a real TV station getting it, right?

344
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:19,082
Scott: I hope other people follow suit because if you look even the unpopular videos They post are getting like hundreds of thousands of views.

345
00:24:19,102 --> 00:24:32,583
Scott: It is not unpopular All right, so I want to see a day We're pretty much just every TV station just puts all their shows on YouTube with subtitles to spread them around the world Perhaps with a pre-funding model.

346
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:33,910
Rym: Yeah being puppy care.

347
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,966
Scott: Yeah, so you don't need some shady fucking fansubbers posting it on weird websites and whatnot.

348
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:39,950
Scott: They just post legit.

349
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:47,089
Rym: So yeah in the meta moment the book club book is I do by William Gibson.

350
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:50,207
Rym: now I started reading it again because I had a lot a bunch of long flights.

351
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:50,569
Rym: I didn't.

354
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:00,767
Scott: That's my time.

355
00:25:00,787 --> 00:25:03,859
Rym: So I started reading it.

356
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:14,990
Rym: I read just like the first chapter and with all the cyberpunk jargon and awesome just Stereotypical cliched cyberpunk crap that happens in the beginning.

357
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:19,448
Rym: It's easy to forget that it wasn't cliche when this book was written.

358
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:23,320
Rym: guys This book was written in 1996.

359
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,770
Scott: yep 1996.

00:25:36,671 --> 00:25:38,237
Rym: There's cyber the.

364
00:25:38,358 --> 00:25:41,250
Rym: the ideas and books like this were not common.

365
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:47,390
Rym: It's the one of those situations where something seems cliche and you forget that it came about before that thing was cliche.

366
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,258
Rym: This book is kind kind of awesome.

367
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:52,547
Rym: So I actually I'm really looking forward to reading the rest of it again.

368

Rym: Scott and I are gonna split up and each sit on a different panel about a different topic.

373
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:19,268
Rym: I think Scott's on something about Video game controllers and I'm on something about privacy and games.

374
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:30,309
Rym: and We're both going to be on one about Games of the future like gaming 30 years from now kind of kind of like y plus 30 But without any trademark infringement whatsoever on that name.

426
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:40,796
Rym: I want to watch more badly than ponies But not well because your time is doing the things that if ponies did similar kinds of things They'd be both a tier shows.

427
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:43,265
Scott: The only thing I really want to watch badly.

Scott: This is a good guy.

434
00:29:58,152 --> 00:30:03,470
Rym: I like how both ponies and and adventure time have had the direct continuity episodes.

435
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,340
Scott: You notice James had the brack voice actor.

436
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:12,060

437
00:30:14,332 --> 00:30:17,890
Rym: She brought him to be used for that purpose if things went wrong.

438
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:24,169
Rym: Okay, yeah sure I would do radio for you but Scott doesn't wanna you can do your own radio for you.

439
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,965

Scott: What why?

443
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:37,341
Rym: Let's let's do it let's do it radio for you.

444
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:43,750
Rym: Okay anyway So there is a little bit of a brouhaha on the internet.

445
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:49,169
Rym: This is all you a little bit hubbub about a job posting from one penny arcade incorporated.

446
00:30:49,189 --> 00:31:00,470
Rym: I Don't want to talk about the social side of this because it's obvious I don't want to talk about the the all the issues except the actual job posting because a lot of the complaints.

447
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:01,148
Rym: Here's the deal.

448
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:08,393
Rym: They posted a pretty accurate job posting for the kind of tech guy they wanted because the tech guy they have is leaving to do something else.

449
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:19,279
Rym: so the internet went crazy about it and About a third of the people maybe half the people who are complaining about this We're complaining about the wrong thing.

450
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:22,710
Rym: and the people who are complaining in the manner that we're about to talk about.

451
00:31:23,671 --> 00:31:26,989
Rym: There's a reason those people do not have high paying jobs.

452
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:29,742
Rym: So a complaint.

453
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:29,964
Rym: well here.

454
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:30,570
Rym: I'm gonna read the job.

455
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:34,830
Scott: Well, I mean a lot of people are complaining simply because they're penny arcade haters.

456
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,657
Scott: They'll hate on anything penny arcade does ever.

457
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:45,153
Scott: they'll find a reason to make it like a huge, you know Catastrophe where it's like this 10,000 job postings just like this every day about companies You don't care about.

458
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:46,459
Scott: so you're not making a hullabaloo.

459
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,283
Rym: now there have been.

460
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:47,926
Rym: don't get us wrong.

461
00:31:47,946 --> 00:31:49,892
Rym: there are penny arcade Catastrophes.

462
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:52,665
Scott: my crew lick like this one also.

463
00:31:52,685 --> 00:31:53,770
Scott: Yeah, but this is it.

464
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,805
Scott: This is yeah the I mean asking someone to work a zillion hours is awful.

465
00:31:57,926 --> 00:31:58,327
Scott: the end.

466
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,080
Rym: well I'm not sure how many hours they actually work.

467
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:06,315
Scott: the guy said he there was a posting by the guy who had That post up.

468
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:06,877
Rym: I read that.

469
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,650
Scott: he said yeah, basically you can't go anywhere because you're on a call.

470
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:12,800
Scott: You're the only guy.

471
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,623
Rym: there's two separate things There's the on-call thing and then there's the actual working hours thing.

472
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:27,024
Rym: because not to disparage him But based on reading that and seeing just kind of how this all evolved I don't think other than the on-call aspect the amount of work.

473
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:27,747
Rym: It would take to do.

474
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:32,556
Rym: what they need is Maybe Maybe 20 hours of work a week.

475
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:39,629
Scott: right but if you work at penny arcade who's gonna make you stay there for a zillion hours A week, and it'll look down on you if you leave at 5 every day?

476
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:40,915
Rym: Maybe maybe not.

477
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:41,839
Rym: maybe what have you got everything?

478
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:46,565
Rym: what if you came to the office just fucking hung out and play games cuz there Was no work to do cuz you did it all who would fire you?

479
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:47,189
Rym: maybe I?

480
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:48,671
Rym: Don't know.

481
00:32:48,812 --> 00:32:51,003
Rym: if he's smart you definitely give you a talking to?

482
00:32:51,224 --> 00:32:51,545
Scott: I don't know.

483
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:52,490
Rym: not because there's there.

484
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,320
Rym: It's that that's one of the biggest problems with tech.

485
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:55,661
Rym: is the?

486
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:56,424
Rym: you know what?

487
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:59,882
Rym: it's the same thing that managers of Terrible fast-food jobs will say.

488
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:00,969
Rym: you'll hear this phrase a lot.

489
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:15,029
Rym: They'll say if you got time to lean you got time to clean Meaning they're paying you for your time, so if you if you finish all the work It's your responsibility to find more work to do and to work more because otherwise why are they paying you?

490
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,493
Scott: Why are you?

491
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:19,930
Scott: maybe you should have hired paid hired me for half the time that you hired before?

492
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:27,890
Rym: My fault that you mis-hired me, but the problem is they'll hire you for half the time But then pay you half as much, and then you don't have enough money to live.

493
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:33,590
Rym: We kind of have this messed up to pay me twice pay me more per hour And then we have this messed up situation in America.

494
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:38,270
Rym: This is why you're expected to have a full-time job of 40.

495
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,423
Scott: Technology which is why we're not talking about this part.

496
00:33:40,443 --> 00:33:41,650
Scott: We're talking about the technology part.

497
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,370
Rym: Yeah, but I feel you itching to talk about it.

498
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,454
Scott: No, that was all I just said.

499
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:45,276
Scott: the end now.

500
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:48,708
Rym: so here are the requirements of the job.

501
00:33:48,728 --> 00:33:56,555
Rym: mm-hmm You need to have an attention level of attention to detail that everyone writes that in every job description ever it means nothing I know except it.

502
00:33:56,595 --> 00:33:56,736
Rym: Well.

503
00:33:56,756 --> 00:34:00,030
Rym: It doesn't mean it means nothing except that anyone who doesn't I would not hire.

504
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:05,389
Rym: Sure, I mean if I get an email from someone that has a how do you measure someone's attention to detail?

505
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:13,190
Rym: Simple if they follow the instructions that I put on the job posting and there are no misspellings in their resume or the email they Sent me

506
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,512
Scott: done

507
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:18,893
Rym: if they don't meet that record that they basically if they don't have that then There's

508
00:34:18,913 --> 00:34:21,362
Scott: no reason to write that on the res on the job posting.

509
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:23,250
Rym: yeah, maybe I don't know.

510
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,681
Rym: Maybe you need to write things like not creeper.

00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:27,188

Scott: yeah.

513
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,862
Rym: Strong project management skills okay, which is something most people who say they have do not have.

514
00:34:33,445 --> 00:34:35,389
Scott: it's such a subjective not you know?

515
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:47,187
Rym: Measurable yeah, so whatever motivated self-starter who can overcome and work around issues independently Yeah, okay flexibility to travel 30% of the time Not uncommon in tech.

516
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,237
Rym: I Travel almost that person.

517
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:52,489
Scott: I mean you got to be going to PAX is you're gonna be good right?

518
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,739

00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,828
Rym: I go to Turkey I go I travel overseas.

520
00:34:56,868 --> 00:35:03,490
Rym: so much for Work that I had two sets of extra pages added to my passport, and I will still probably fill it before it expires.

521
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:08,643
Rym: You have no problems working in a creative and potentially offensive environment.

522
00:35:08,863 --> 00:35:10,087
Scott: Yeah, definitely not a problem.

523
00:35:10,227 --> 00:35:11,210
Scott: Yeah, it's penny arcade.

524
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:14,642
Rym: Flexibility adapting to deadlines changing schedules priorities.

525
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:19,919
Rym: You know the same old work well under pressure Ability to communicate and work in a team environment.

526
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,003
Rym: Yeah again.

527
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:22,629
Scott: I can't work with people you can't work.

528
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:27,830
Scott: Go work on go be an author right woods have no problem appearing on camera.

529
00:35:28,331 --> 00:35:31,020
Rym: Yeah, okay, what's for a lot of people?

530
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:34,229
Rym: tech people even complain about that one they?

531
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,244
Rym: People we know okay said things like they would have.

532
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,470
Rym: someone would have to pay me extra.

533
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:45,422
Rym: I feel like that's a huge negative of being on camera Which I guess is just the different kinds of jobs don't go out in public ever.

534
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:49,368
Rym: like I never leave I have tech job clothes on your blinds.

535
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,847
Rym: I worked for one financial company where I was basically the guy in the back room making everything work.

536
00:35:54,369 --> 00:36:00,917
Rym: now I work for a tech company where I do private lectures that are videoed for Gigantic audiences on a regular basis.

537
00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:05,855
Rym: like that shit comes with the territory I consider being on camera a perk Not a negative.

538
00:36:06,176 --> 00:36:18,683
Rym: you could pay me less if I get to be on camera and get some personal Legend of Krauser not just the back end credited Legend of Krauser, yeah Okay, the messed up one because this is kind of relevant to the tech world.

539
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:23,612
Rym: if anything breaks in the middle of the night You were expected to be on call 24/7.

540
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:29,647
Scott: No, you're supposed to have multiple people in on call shifts so that people can have lives or not?

541
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:33,335
Rym: everything is production critical 24/7.

542
00:36:33,335 --> 00:36:36,144
Scott: obviously I mean Seriously know what you can't.

543
00:36:36,284 --> 00:36:39,053
Scott: I mean you know it is penny arcade is?

544
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:39,314
Scott: you know?

545
00:36:39,354 --> 00:36:46,560
Scott: this website and all these people are living off Of it, so if it goes down you're losing money, and that feeds the people who work there, right?

546
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,652
Scott: But if people can't read a webcomic until I get in in the morning And then at nine o'clock in the morning they can read the webcomic again.

547
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:55,520
Scott: That's not a big fucking deal.

548
00:36:56,022 --> 00:36:57,428
Scott: That is a very very small deal.

549
00:36:57,669 --> 00:36:58,413
Scott: It's not a bank.

550
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:00,040
Scott: It's not a hospital.

551
00:37:00,622 --> 00:37:03,610
Scott: It's not you know fucking military systems.

552
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:05,596
Scott: It's not the stock market.

553
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:06,358
Scott: It's not something.

554
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:07,160
Scott: That's so disastrous.

555
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:07,441
Scott: It's.

556
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:09,632
Scott: you can't read a webcomic for six hours.

557
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:11,260
Scott: I can fix that in the morning.

558
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:15,294
Scott: You don't have to wake me up for that right just because you care about it that much.

559
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:17,588
Scott: the rest of the world doesn't care About it that much.

560
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:17,992
Rym: Yep.

Rym: I have met very few Competent tech people who don't have one of those.

576
00:37:56,902 --> 00:38:02,179
Rym: I'm sorry But a lot of people know how to code or they know how to set up a server.

577
00:38:02,703 --> 00:38:05,260
Scott: But the diff I know people who do have that and don't know how to cook.

578
00:38:05,345 --> 00:38:14,676
Rym: Yeah the people who have the degrees at least from a reasonably good school tend to have all of the skills they can set up a server and write code.

579
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:15,462
Scott: Mm-hmm.

580
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:19,232

00:38:22,222 --> 00:38:23,920
Scott: Basically, they don't want someone fresh out of college.

584
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:29,620
Scott: They want someone who has been able to do this before because you are going to be responsible for their livelihoods effectively.

585
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,618
Scott: So they want you to at least know what you're doing.

586
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,660
Rym: some Yeah, but also not just someone who can write code but also someone who can manage the code itself.

587
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,367
Rym: Mm-hmm, and those are two different jobs.

588
00:38:39,387 --> 00:38:42,399
Rym: That's why RIT had computer science and software engineering.

589
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:52,705
Rym: Strong experience in PHP MySQL JavaScript CSS Apache jQuery Ajax, duh modern technologies Relatively speaking.

590
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:56,780
Rym: Yeah, if you're a web person of any kind those things should all be on your resume already.

591
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:02,437
Rym: Strong experience in one of Java Python Ruby or any other object-oriented language.

592

Scott: Yeah, it doesn't really matter.

593
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,679
Scott: You just gotta be able to write code.

594
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,910
Rym: Yeah If you if you know Python and you do web development and you have to do something that's Java instead You can just do it.

595
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,391
Rym: if you're a good programmer, of course Maybe you'll have to look up a few keywords and things along the way.

596
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:18,900
Rym: change an IDE setup, but it's not hard.

597
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:26,380
Rym: a history of running running and configuring multiple server environments including load balancers web accelerators caching systems databases.

598
00:39:26,862 --> 00:39:27,324
Scott: Not hard.

599
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:31,339
Rym: a history of running multiple server environments load balancers varnish.

600
00:39:32,243 --> 00:39:33,286
Rym: So I do that.

601
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:42,960
Rym: the complaint I saw from a lot of people on the internet Was that that set of requirements does not describe one person it describes a number of people.

602
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:58,500
Rym: That no, well the hours of all those skills the hours describes a number of people but these skills describe If you ignore the 24/7 support thing Well for a shop like penny arcade the number of hours of someone competent.

603
00:39:58,881 --> 00:40:01,048
Rym: Well, yeah a 40-hour can we work?

604
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:02,252
Rym: week would cover all of that?

605
00:40:02,553 --> 00:40:03,054
Scott: Absolutely.

606
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:04,760
Scott: I mean that's I do all that.

607
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:20,196
Rym: So most of the night working less than 20 hours 40 hours a week who are complaining that Nobody has all those skills Including also being I have all those skills Basic IT in the office like configure the office firewall cuz something changed.

608
00:40:20,456 --> 00:40:21,540
Scott: all those skills and more.

609
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:27,418
Rym: Yeah, anyone with competence in tech could do all those things and and could learn the few things.

610
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:28,020
Rym: They don't know, right?

611
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:39,492
Scott: There's a lot there's a lot of people out there I noticed because I hire people and I interview people and they have Instead of being generally knowledgeable with computers They know one thing like.

612
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:49,486
Scott: they did Ruby on Rails Tutorials and they made web apps with Ruby on Rails and all they did was write Ruby on Rails code and they learned Ruby on Rails But they didn't learn anything else.

613
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,149
Scott: so they can't.

614
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:56,951
Scott: if you ask them to do something the same exact thing and something else they can't Do it because they didn't learn HTTP or how the web works.

615
00:40:57,152 --> 00:41:02,653
Rym: they just learned Ruby on Rails Ruby on Rails and they don't know how to type app get install Ruby.

616
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:09,100
Scott: They hosted it on Heroku right which did all the hosting work for them, so they never learned how to set up a Linux server.

617
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,560
Scott: They did everything on their Mac right following a tutorial to set it up once right the development environment.

618
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,880
Scott: They don't know how to set up the server environment at all because Heroku did it for them.

619
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:24,006
Scott: They paid a bunch of money extra to Heroku for the more expensive hosting And that's pretty much it right.

620
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:27,820
Scott: It's like they know exactly one thing and they don't know any other things.

621
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:34,040
Scott: They don't understand how computers work or anything about that and they probably don't have the BS in computer science.

622
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:37,980
Scott: So they're not good for having any sort of real job.

623
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,516
Scott: I would never hire you for anything unless I really just needed like an army of Ruby on Rails.

624
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:54,300
Rym: guys who only know one Thing and now yeah, so guys aside from the 24/7 work-life balance thing for support Yeah, the the technical requirements of this job are very minimal actually.

625
00:41:54,801 --> 00:42:04,520
Rym: Yeah, like that's a baby like really really low-hanging fruit like anyone fresh out of college Would probably should be able to do these things.

626
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,423
Rym: Yeah, so they want.

627
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:08,775
Scott: they just want someone who's they're sure can do those things and isn't?

628
00:42:08,855 --> 00:42:10,824
Scott: probably I could have done that job Out of college.

629
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:11,792
Rym: Oh easily easily.

630
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:21,775
Rym: I Could not have just I'm not really a developer like it would have If I did it, it would have taken me 80 hour weeks just to learn They should have posted a job when I was coming out of college.

631
00:42:21,815 --> 00:42:22,459
Scott: They would have gotten me.

632
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:31,193
Rym: I've been too naive and dumb and take like like when I saw that other posting they had before for packs event manager And I read it and it literally was this is a list of everything.

633
00:42:31,234 --> 00:42:32,258
Rym: rims good at mm-hmm.

634
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,647
Rym: Just write down the list.

635
00:42:34,212 --> 00:42:38,230
Rym: Rym Rym Rym Rym Rym Sure, of course then I would have.

636
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,658
Rym: I would have I don't know.

637
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:42,007
Rym: Imagine a weird alternate reality.

638
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,011
Rym: We're fresh out of college.

639
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:44,999
Rym: Those two jobs got posted and we applied for them.

640
00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:48,600
Scott: I mean, I'm sure this happens in lots of other fields too, right?

641
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:54,586
Scott: It's like you never passed by a car dealer and it's like they specialize in one kind of car and it's like dude You know how cars work.

642
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:56,720
Scott: shouldn't you be able to repair any car, right?

643
00:42:57,203 --> 00:42:59,660
Scott: But no, it's like it's not just the ones that are on the dealership, right?

644
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:05,060
Scott: It'll be like it's like some, you know independent mechanic, but it's like the whole parking lot is all Benz's.

645
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,964
Scott: It's like we fix Benz's.

646
00:43:06,346 --> 00:43:06,668
Scott: that's it.

647
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:08,919
Scott: And it's like if you brought him a Ford, I'd bet they'd fuck it up.

648
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:09,964
Scott: It's like.

649
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,400
Scott: shouldn't you understand cars fundamentally on some fundamental level mechanics?

650
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,340
Rym: Well, it might be the expertise of you know, they're good at working with these cars don't want to work on cars.

651
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:27,020
Scott: They're not good at working with I'm sure but it's like I feel like if I knew mechanics and I was a mechanic I would be able to fix any car.

652
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,065
Rym: Oh Scott, I'll put it this way.

653
00:43:28,346 --> 00:43:32,798
Rym: If you brought me an HP UX server and something wasn't working I could probably fix it.

654
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:33,684
Scott: I could definitely fix it.

655
00:43:33,704 --> 00:43:37,402
Rym: But it would take me twice as long and I'd be pissed off the whole time because it's HP UX.

656
00:43:37,463 --> 00:43:41,080
Scott: It takes me just as long to Google HP UX as it takes me to Google.

657
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:46,853
Scott: It actually takes me slightly longer to Google HP UX than it takes me to Google BSD because it's one more character to type.

658
00:43:47,235 --> 00:43:48,661
Rym: Ah, here's the trouble HP UX.

659
00:43:48,701 --> 00:43:53,395
Rym: you won't find as much up-to-date modern useful information because it's not commonly used.

660
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:53,977
Rym: It's old.

661
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:54,820
Scott: I could still do it.

662
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,853
Rym: Yeah, you could but it'd take you longer than someone whose thing was HP UX.

663
00:43:57,873 --> 00:43:58,958
Scott: Yeah, we'll see you would?

664
00:43:59,219 --> 00:43:59,480
Rym: we got it?

665
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,103
Rym: Whatever race.

666
00:44:00,163 --> 00:44:03,800
Rym: Well, I'll set up an HP UX server and then I'll break something on it.

667
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,191
Rym: I'll find some old surprises.

668
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:07,055
Scott: break NTP.

669
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:08,040
Scott: That's what you do.

670
00:44:09,581 --> 00:44:11,739
Scott: You'd be like out the clocks off by like a millisecond.

671
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:14,288
Scott: So I'm like, yeah, it's working.

672
00:44:14,328 --> 00:44:15,475
Scott: who gives a shit about a millisecond.

673
00:44:15,496 --> 00:44:16,119
Scott: It's a webcomic.

674
00:44:16,381 --> 00:44:17,752
Rym: So funny story.

675
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:35,757
Rym: back at RIT one of my capstone classes was this sort of like holistic class of all the aspects of IT and system administration together into one and One of the final labs was we had a team and me and Katsu were on this team with some people and we had this complex environment with some servers some clients a wireless access point that they connected through and a router.

676
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:40,655
Rym: and we had this whole lab Set up and we got it all working and we had to make it secure and all that BS.

677
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:46,374
Rym: and then for one of Our lab practicals we had to leave the room and the professor's broke six things.

678
00:44:46,655 --> 00:44:51,260
Rym: Mm-hmm and we had to Bring them back up as quickly as possible and document what we did.

679
00:44:51,962 --> 00:44:52,658
Scott: reimage done.

680
00:44:53,621 --> 00:45:00,932
Rym: Yeah, so we came back in and we look at oh sure enough, you know our clients can't connect to the servers and one of the server demons had crashed.

681
00:45:00,952 --> 00:45:04,944
Rym: here we did we rebooted everything and Then it still didn't work.

682
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:08,900
Rym: and then we looked and the firewall like the config file was corrupt because of our log message.

683
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,067
Rym: So we fixed that and then it was fine.

684
00:45:10,631 --> 00:45:13,040
Rym: then we came back and we were like, yeah We fixed it all immediately.

685
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:21,160
Rym: There was only one problem and they got really mad at us and it turned out that all the changes they had made Like they did all this really complex crap.

686
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:29,170
Rym: One of the things they did is they put dummy records in the ARP table of the router So that traffic would only flow one way from certain hosts.

687
00:45:29,631 --> 00:45:31,015
Rym: Okay, the ARP tables wiped out.

688
00:45:31,036 --> 00:45:34,987
Rym: if you just recycle the device There was no point in troubleshooting it.

689
00:45:35,328 --> 00:45:35,549
Rym: Right?

690
00:45:35,709 --> 00:45:36,633
Rym: We saw it wasn't working.

691
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:38,138
Rym: We just recycled it and it was fixed.

692
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:41,136
Rym: Sure They ended up having to give us an A but they were not happy.

693
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:44,399
Scott: No I would be a lot smarter than that.

694
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:46,043
Scott: Let's see.

695
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:49,139
Scott: What would I do to a computer to make that would break it?

696
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,260
Scott: But you would have a hard time finding that anything was broken.

697
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,010
Scott: Well, I still there has to be a bug report or it's unfair.

698
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,386
Scott: Yeah, there has to be a description of a behavior That's incorrect.

699
00:45:58,446 --> 00:45:58,667
Scott: Right?

700
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,700
Scott: Yep, like can't log in.

701
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:06,260
Rym: It says password incorrect or I run the application in the web browser and it works except it doesn't display any of the images.

702
00:46:06,623 --> 00:46:09,343
Scott: Yeah, like what I could do is I could be like, okay No one can log in.

703
00:46:09,363 --> 00:46:14,200
Scott: and then I would like the Etsy password file and the shadow file would still be correct.

704
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:25,660
Scott: But actually I would find I would reconfigure it to actually be using some shadow file that's hidden somewhere So that you wouldn't even you have to find the config file that points to which shadow file is being used.

705
00:46:25,963 --> 00:46:33,120
Rym: I just said yeah I'd set the total number of file handles that you can have open to something really small so stuff would break or I would be.

706
00:46:33,722 --> 00:46:41,677
Scott: The sound isn't only working in some apps and I like what I did to you is I like swapped out your kernel modules To change the sound driver or something.

707
00:46:43,062 --> 00:46:45,319
Scott: It'd be like, yeah, you'll never see that in a million years.

708
00:46:46,702 --> 00:46:51,380
Rym: But yeah again not talking about the 24/7 support stuff the work-life balance all those things.

709
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,804
Rym: There's a discussion to be had there.

710
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:53,627
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

711
00:46:54,128 --> 00:46:57,800
Rym: I think the 24/7 support requirement is ridiculous bullshit.

712
00:46:58,468 --> 00:47:01,086
Rym: I Refused to be on call.

713
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:04,702
Rym: the part of the reason I have the care I have is that I was done with being on call Ever.

714
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:14,960
Scott: Yeah, the other thing with this right is like not only are these people sort of ridiculous saying Oh one person can't have all these skills It's bad if you don't have all of them, right?

715
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,120
Scott: Like what is someone I know in people who are like system administration skills and development skills?

716
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:29,540
Scott: They set up a web server and it would be the most insecure Wrongly network configured thing in the universe and then the thing would just get taken down as soon as anyone tried to attack it ever.

717
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:32,612
Scott: Yep, and it's like why did I just get taken down?

718
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:34,199
Scott: Well, you didn't do any IP tables at all.

719
00:47:34,701 --> 00:47:36,648
Scott: You did SSH with passwords.

720
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:39,459
Rym: Oh most people in the world turn off IP tables the first thing they do.

721
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:40,804
Scott: Why does it should?

722
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:42,431
Scott: it's turned off usually by default.

723
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:45,467
Scott: You have to set it up to actually add things to it Oh, and then they'll turn off.

724
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:49,875
Rym: Oh, you know what I would do if I was gonna fuck up your server I would just turn on se Linux and not tell you.

725
00:47:50,157 --> 00:47:55,449
Scott: Yeah But yeah, it's like, you know, it's like.

726
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,318
Scott: there's things that you have to do, you know.

727
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,840
Scott: They didn't turn on automatic security updates and then they didn't constantly maintain the server every single day with the new security update.

728
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,727
Scott: So this no, this is zero day.

729
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:07,313
Scott: wouldn't you just put out a patch?

730
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:08,919
Scott: I read the patch, you know.

731
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:11,195
Scott: Yeah, I know you haven't installed that patch yet.

732
00:48:11,275 --> 00:48:17,183
Scott: I nail you with it Whatever it is, right because you haven't done it yet because you didn't set up auto update to install as soon as it would do Pushed it out.

733
00:48:17,324 --> 00:48:17,525
Rym: Yep.

734
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:20,060
Scott: Good job because that's not something that's on by default.

735
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:27,680
Rym: Now the other hilarious thing was the speculation about salaries because they make this point in the thing about salaries negotiable quotes.

736
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:28,989
Rym: But you should know up front.

737
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:30,620
Rym: We're not terribly money motivated group.

738
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:32,710
Rym: We're more likely to spend less money on salary.

739
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,522
Rym: invest that in making your day-to-day work life better Sure.

740
00:48:35,923 --> 00:48:40,599
Rym: Now that could reek of startup culture of hey you work somewhere cool, but we don't pay you.

741
00:48:41,563 --> 00:48:42,046
Rym: We don't know.

742
00:48:42,427 --> 00:48:44,900
Scott: but I'm not motivated by money either.

743
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:45,904
Scott: But there's still had.

744
00:48:46,145 --> 00:48:49,980
Scott: I am motivated almost entirely by money, but you still have to pay me a lot of money.

745
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:52,200
Scott: You can't not pay me a lot of money.

746
00:48:52,342 --> 00:48:57,340
Scott: So I saw someone Someone who actually someone who's competent and has all those skills.

747
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,631
Scott: They obviously didn't put any numbers so we can't judge.

748
00:48:59,852 --> 00:49:03,193
Scott: they might you know, because they're so rich They might be like, yeah, not a lot of money 300k, right?

749
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,892
Rym: Yeah, whatever I was going to apply for this job.

750
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,920
Scott: I Would ask oh if they first of all they had absolutely they must get rid of the on-call, right?

751
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:21,500
Scott: So if they agree to get rid of the on-call nonsense Then you'd probably had to pay me like 150 to 200,000.

752
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:29,891
Scott: I was gonna say I would ask for 150 because I think the fringe benefit someone with those Someone with those skills is rare and that's the market value.

753
00:49:29,972 --> 00:49:32,119
Rym: I would argue that someone of those skills is not that rare.

754
00:49:33,382 --> 00:49:34,569
Scott: It's more rare than you think.

755
00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:34,911
Rym: Yeah.

756
00:49:35,092 --> 00:49:42,314
Rym: Well, I guess go try to hire someone Those tech skills and the social skills required for a job like this.

757
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,360
Scott: Yeah find someone who has all that whole package.

758
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,500
Scott: Yeah, kind of rare and especially they're geographically limiting me.

759
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,999
Rym: I was gonna say I would only ask for 150k because the fringe benefits of a job like this actually would be pretty sweet.

760
00:49:54,179 --> 00:50:06,833
Rym: Yeah But if that was at borrowing Oh I saw a post on Twitter a tweet that said something to the effect of Wow Anyone who applies to this should better at least ask for 50k.

761
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:08,760
Rym: Jesus like what?

762
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,140
Rym: I got paid that at my internship.

763
00:50:13,822 --> 00:50:16,719
Rym: Like do you people have no conception of what the tech world is like?

764
00:50:19,704 --> 00:50:20,896
Rym: 50k is what teachers make.

765
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:24,125
Scott: It's not enough money.

766
00:50:24,145 --> 00:50:26,315
Rym: that's close to the poverty line in New York City.

767
00:50:26,335 --> 00:50:29,534
Scott: that is not yeah And Seattle's not much better right now.

768
00:50:29,554 --> 00:50:30,319
Scott: Where are you gonna live?

769
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,744
Scott: And the hostel the other?

770
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:35,654
Rym: a lot of people because there's the no salary number is listed here.

771
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:36,717
Rym: that that is tip.

772
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:41,380
Rym: people seem to Just really think that this job means that they don't pay anything.

773
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,090
Rym: I get the impression they're gonna pay a reasonable amount of money.

774
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,640
Rym: They're just not gonna pay some ridiculous amount of money.

775
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:47,644
Rym: Yeah, I might be wrong.

776
00:50:47,665 --> 00:50:50,900
Scott: I don't know but probably gonna play slightly less than the market rate.

777
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:51,984
Scott: I mean no one.

778
00:50:52,024 --> 00:50:54,412
Rym: they'll probably shoot for like 80 or 90.

779
00:50:54,412 --> 00:50:57,904
Scott: anyone who has these social and technical skills to be Considered for the job.

780
00:50:57,984 --> 00:50:58,928
Scott: right you're in Seattle.

781
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:00,694
Scott: It's probably gonna be like an ex Amazon employee.

782
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:06,320
Scott: They said don't relocate you Yeah to Seattle, but it's like it's someone who's willing to live in Seattle.

783
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:10,020
Rym: So it's well, they're obviously going after the single nerd demographic.

784
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:19,152
Scott: It's an intelligent city person is gonna know what their own market value is exactly and is only gonna mark my noble Smartly negotiate it down a little bit.

785
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:23,231
Scott: if you're not smart enough to do that You're probably not smart enough to be considered for the job in the first place.

786
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:27,540
Rym: now the well Yeah, I don't want to get into the 24-7 any of the social stuff.

787
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,654
Rym: But if you out there some tech nerd and you're gonna try to apply for this job.

788
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:37,496
Rym: Here's my advice to you one Don't list me as a reference unless you've talked to me at least once before now.

789
00:51:37,777 --> 00:51:41,420
Rym: Okay kids I Yes, people have done that.

790
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:52,152
Rym: I've written a lot of college recommendation letters and reference letters in the last couple of years and I Only actually write them for people who I can actually vouch for.

791
00:51:52,273 --> 00:51:56,769
Rym: so those of you who got letters from me It's because I actually have some respect for you.

792
00:51:58,002 --> 00:52:00,719
Rym: Those of you who I didn't write them for it's because I had no idea who you were.

793
00:52:01,781 --> 00:52:09,604
Rym: So if you think that you can list people like us because we lecture at penny arcade, you know at the packs penny arcade expo Unless we know who you are.

794
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:10,347
Rym: That's not gonna help.

795
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:11,571
Scott: Yeah, I can't.

796
00:52:11,612 --> 00:52:12,575
Scott: I'm gonna recommend you.

797
00:52:12,595 --> 00:52:13,278
Scott: I don't know who you are.

798
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:18,760
Rym: do Ask for the salary you think you need notice how they didn't say what a salary is.

799
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,384
Rym: That's common in tech jobs.

800
00:52:20,725 --> 00:52:21,708
Scott: ask for more.

801
00:52:22,009 --> 00:52:29,813
Rym: ask for what you think you need plus plus 10 or 15 K. I mean I made a big mistake when I applied to my first job in the.

802
00:52:29,893 --> 00:52:34,019
Scott: I could have made a lot more money if I Would have asked for more monies in the olden days.

803
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:42,138
Rym: I asked when I when I got that first job for that broker dealer I asked for 60 K. I was like, yeah, I need at least 60 K and they were like sure done.

804
00:52:42,218 --> 00:52:44,549

810
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:53,519
Rym: They're like, yeah, you really asked for the wrong amount of money kid.

811
00:52:54,701 --> 00:52:56,651
