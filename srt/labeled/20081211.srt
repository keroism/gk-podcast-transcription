Scott: It's Thursday December 11th.

2
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:12,369
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:19,119
Scott: I'm Rick and this is the GeekNights book club and tonight We discuss a wizard of Earthsea.

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:32,734
Rym: Let's do this as I said on the show last night.

5
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:35,380
Rym: I took Wednesday off to go skiing.

6
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:37,430
Rym: I'd planned this for quite some time.

7
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,616
Rym: I was looking forward to it.

8
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,057
Rym: I figured on a Wednesday No one would be out there and it had been beautiful weather like this.

9
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:44,800
Rym: according to the mountain.

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,688
Rym: They even had a half a foot of powder up there.

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,275
Rym: so Tuesday night.

12
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:49,400
Rym: I'm getting all my stuff together.

13
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:50,163
Scott: That's enough.

14
00:00:50,203 --> 00:00:54,860
Scott: like six inches doesn't seem that much well and like two or three feet of other snow, okay?

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,547
Rym: But no, I mean they're basically anytime you ski.

16
00:00:57,587 --> 00:00:58,791
Rym: There's two surfaces.

17
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:01,619
Rym: There's like the underneath, and then there's what's on top.

18
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:05,654
Rym: Uh-huh like you'll have the pack down underneath dirt.

19
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:07,139
Rym: well that I guess.

20
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:13,116
Rym: yeah There's rocks, and then there's the mantle and then there's the magma and then there's the bitter horrible core.

21
00:01:13,297 --> 00:01:14,460
Scott: you go to the skiing website.

22
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,572
Scott: What are the conditions today?

23
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:16,240
Scott: bedrock?

24
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:18,210
Scott: It's really.

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,060
Scott: it's not looking too good.

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:33,720
Rym: Well, I do recall last year when I went skiing in for the first time with scojo that it was in spring basically And there was this path of snow and then either side was green grass Man, I could imagine like pretty snow skiing in this an earthquake.

27
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:40,149
Rym: Anyway, so you know I'm all set for this.

28
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:41,475
Rym: I packed all my stuff together.

29
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:42,740
Rym: I'm getting ready to go.

30
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:48,680
Rym: Look in the weather And it's gonna be like 50 degrees and it's gonna rain.

31
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:52,995
Scott: It's gonna rain and sure enough it rain, and it was 50 degrees.

32
00:01:53,075 --> 00:02:02,540
Rym: the conditions went from packed powder with a first layer of powder to Loose granular, which is a code word for crap.

33
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,809
Rym: Okay, so uh I basically see.

34
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:10,419
Scott: why do they even say like you know like loose girl?

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,601
Scott: I don't.

36
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:13,196
Scott: they just say good ski today or bad.

37
00:02:13,256 --> 00:02:13,940
Scott: Don't see today?

38
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:15,100
Rym: Well, they kind of do.

39
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,586
Rym: But there's different kinds of good ski.

40
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:20,380
Rym: like some people like to ski on packed powder because it's easy and you can go real fast.

41
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,120
Rym: But some people like powder powder because you can kind of float in it, and it's really cool.

42
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,404
Scott: And you may have a mess you know, but it's like they should just be like ski able unskiable You know.

43
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:31,189
Scott: and then you know.

44
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,880
Scott: put the details there for the people who care.

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,050
Scott: But you know most most people just care is ski able unskiable.

46
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,357
Rym: loose granular is perfectly ski able.

47
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:41,539
Rym: the only problem with it Is that it was also raining.

48
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:46,026
Rym: Uh-huh imagine skiing in the cold or rain Mmm.

49
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:50,835
Scott: Yeah imagine Maybe the mountains above the clouds and you'll be all right.

50
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:52,060
Rym: No I looked on the website.

51
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,225
Rym: I looked at the webcam.

52
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,490
Rym: It did not look happy.

53
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,679
Scott: webcam is a very good idea for the skiing.

54
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,726
Scott: yes You know what you see.

55
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:58,856
Scott: anyone skiing on the webcam.

56
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:01,848
Rym: No No one even the website.

57
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,939
Rym: They were like great skiing later in the week.

58
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:09,320
Scott: Okay, so god damn it that must see that's thing.

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,721
Scott: It's like.

60
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:10,323
Scott: you know.

61
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:16,580
Scott: farmers their you know livelihood is controlled by weather, but no they can irrigate and such ski mountains.

62
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:17,563
Scott: That's it.

63
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:18,125
Scott: That's money.

64
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,229
Scott: That's controlled by weather.

65
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,039
Rym: Yep, and you know what they haven't been doing well lately around here.

66
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:27,837
Scott: No, you gotta go go to someplace colder and northerner go to Canadian or Vermont or something.

67
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:29,181
Rym: yeah well pretty much I looked.

68
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:37,713
Rym: I would had to driven two and a half more hours north to properly ski, so I figured it wasn't worth it Especially in that Sunfire, which probably wouldn't make it back.

69
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,280
Scott: Yeah, you just ski back.

70
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,307
Rym: You know what the sad thing is.

71
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:47,990
Rym: ski technology being what it is the skis I have would be basically worthless for cross-country skiing.

72
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:54,008
Rym: uh-huh they can only go down and they can only go fast So they can't go up Kinda, but not so great.

73
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,940
Scott: Well fast is what you want for getting home, right?

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,905
Rym: Yeah, but only if I'm going downhill.

75
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:01,398
Rym: these are for going at an angle like that not so much like that mm-hmm.

76
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:06,098
Rym: So I took off Tuesday next week, I'm hoping I can ski.

77
00:04:06,118 --> 00:04:08,660
Scott: then Why don't you like look at the forecast before you pick the day?

78
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,343
Rym: You know what?

79
00:04:09,363 --> 00:04:12,520
Rym: when I pick the day the forecast would you look at the farmer's almond?

80
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,638
Rym: I think the forecast said it's gonna be cold.

81
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:19,673
Scott: You had a. the forecast isn't accurate so you get close.

82
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:22,563
Scott: Yes, but I don't For five days.

83
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,128
Rym: yeah, yeah, it doesn't matter.

84
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:27,078
Rym: I've already planned like two weeks of next year's vacation.

85
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:27,820
Rym: I'm taking good days.

86
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:31,199
Scott: You got the next year's farmers on the day.

87
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:33,635
Rym: Well, no other than skiing.

88
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:40,700
Rym: most of the stuff I'm doing next year is like go to Japan or go to a convention or go to see Barack Obama.

89
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:44,297
Scott: Waste your time all right.

90
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:47,080
Scott: So you want to do things of the day before we talk about the book?

91
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,519
Rym: We should probably do some things of the day.

92
00:04:48,941 --> 00:05:01,347
Rym: My ulterior motive is that it's actually easier when doing the show to do things of the day than to not do them because I never Really wrote my awesome make the granular granular The modular show script.

93
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:05,260
Rym: so it's basically the script's always gonna put the thing of the day music in the middle.

94
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:18,498
Rym: So if I don't do a thing of the day, it's actually much more difficult to not have that there alright, so um So check this out.

95
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,390
Scott: this dude drew a funny picture.

96
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:25,505
Rym: Funny in a haha way or funny in a slightly offensive way both.

97
00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:28,336
Scott: It's a too soon I don't know.

98
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:28,718
Scott: I don't know.

99
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:34,818
Scott: he drew the picture of the Twin towers, but they are cartoonish Twin towers.

100
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:45,295
Scott: one of them is like sort of got sad droopy eyes and sticking his tongue out And the other ones got like an o-mouth like oh, no Wait, you said oh mouth.

101
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:46,077
Rym: Yeah,

102
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:56,025
Scott: and his eyebrows are up in the air like he's surprised and dismayed and They have little you know cartoony arms and legs and they both have you know airplanes stuck in their heads

103
00:05:56,406 --> 00:05:57,289
Rym: as is expected

104
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:07,653
Scott: right and it Is soft 9/11 and his I guess it's what his wife yeah his wife based on this doodle Made plush Twin towers.

105
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:18,417
Scott: Oh my one of which looks like it has the flu and one of which is like oh, no They even got like little logos on the planes here And you know some people.

106
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:25,569
Scott: it's weird because if you forget about the fact that this references a horrible Event right they're really cute.

107
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:30,175
Rym: Just right you know that's kind of the The problem.

108
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:39,705
Rym: Emily's been having reading italia because it's adorable and hilarious But at the same time the jokes are all about horrible wars from the pre-world war one era.

109
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:40,568
Scott: Yeah.

110
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:44,160
Scott: Yeah, it's difficult and also, right.

111
00:06:45,552 --> 00:07:01,823
Scott: So all the people who post comments you know and all the various places that have been posted right some people are like oh, man it's but it's Like everyone's torn like everyone but boing boing actually it was did something pretty smart right.

112
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:04,049
Scott: they were like look at this right.

113
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:12,710
Scott: and Then they're like I know you might think that this is in poor taste But then they're like if you think that's in poor taste look at this.

114
00:07:14,972 --> 00:07:22,425
Scott: They the link went to one of those 9/11 Commemorative coins, and they're like yeah if you think this is tasteless look at that.

115
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:23,128
Scott: and like like.

116
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:33,484
Scott: this has hearts That's just you know money-grubbing Disgusting bullshit, so it's like okay, all right You know this this we can accept and that you know it's.

117
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:35,350
Scott: it's not making fun of anyone.

118
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,534
Scott: It's not saying like.

119
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:39,986
Scott: you know if you you know fuck you people who died in 9/11.

120
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:41,170
Scott: It's not saying anything like that.

121
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,595
Scott: It's not saying terrorism good.

122
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:48,895
Scott: It's just you know portraying an event in a Way that you know.

123
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:51,405
Scott: let's see think about it more easily.

124
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:57,182
Rym: I guess it helps that I'm generally actually very much a fan of tasteless humor.

125
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:59,008
Rym: if presented in a clever manner.

126
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:02,889
Scott: yes I just don't want to say something a hundred percent tasteless on my show.

127
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:06,164
Scott: well You know what because I'm not a big fan of producing having humor.

128
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:14,065
Rym: having seen these I Can't call it tasteless because it's it's it's in good taste It's what well played.

129
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:18,100
Scott: good, sir You can make a lot of money.

130
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,167
Scott: people don't want to buy them.

131
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:31,033
Scott: Yeah, I actually had an idea once to make a contest and the contest would be submit the most tasteless thing you can possibly make and See what you know.

132
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:34,426
Scott: people toss in there, but tell me the style project.

133
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:35,530
Rym: It's already been done.

134
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,722
Scott: No, no like like this is like you got to go for it.

135
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:41,412
Rym: I Don't know.

136
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:43,381
Rym: I think the style project went for it.

137
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:44,809
Scott: No no not really.

138
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:47,569
Scott: I Already thought of ideas that were worse.

139
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,370
Rym: Anyway my thing of the day that this is a college humor.

140
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,609
Rym: But I can't really pass this up and everyone you might have seen links to this and just ignored it.

141
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:58,590
Rym: No, watch it because it's so fantastically done.

142
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:08,070
Rym: It is 40 inspirational speeches from movies cut together into one Contiguous speech and let me tell you it is fantastic.

143
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:09,793
Scott: See what he did.

144
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,037
Scott: that was clever right is?

145
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:21,970
Scott: he took you know the inspirational speech slowly mounting music And instead of taking the music from the movies and having them go Right he put the one music behind the whole thing.

146
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:24,610
Rym: I think what helps is that it starts out kind of standard.

147
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,476
Rym: You know you got brave hard.

148
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:30,930
Rym: the Mighty Ducks are in there, but at the center Independence Day is in there.

149
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:38,609
Rym: But then there's a lot of really unexpected things in there that really really just add to it.

150
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:41,324
Rym: They make it brilliant as a result.

151
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:51,523
Scott: yeah Having seen most of them it really adds to it like if you have no idea what any of these are it's like Okay, but knowing what the majority of them are is like.

152
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:56,339
Scott: Oh, you've got to get mad Not gonna take it anymore.

153
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:58,229
Scott: say what again.

154
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:02,085
Rym: Sayeth what to my ears again.

155
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:11,410
Rym: good, sir No I don't at all Right?

156
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,609
Rym: So it's the geek guides book club.

157
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:16,202
Scott: Did you read read a book?

158
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:17,630
Rym: read a book see?

159
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:27,450
Scott: Because we're having trouble getting people to read the books because many people were I don't know illiterate I you know even though I think I'd like to think GeekNights is a show for smarter people's.

160
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,538
Scott: People who listen to GeekNights will be smart and read.

161
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:33,970
Rym: it takes four hours to read a Wizard of Earthsea.

162
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:40,170
Rym: This book in four hours talking for distracted hours, I started reading it on the train this morning.

163
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,418
Rym: I finished it just now.

164
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,143
Scott: I thought you've been here.

165
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,150
Scott: I started reading yesterday.

166
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:47,470
Rym: Well, I read like ten pages of it, and then I played NS.

167
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:49,114
Scott: Yeah, you suck.

168
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:52,163
Scott: I read two hours one day two hours the next day.

169
00:10:52,223 --> 00:10:53,266
Scott: boom done right.

170
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:54,730
Scott: so I knew this book.

171
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,174
Scott: This is the reason I chose this book.

172
00:10:56,255 --> 00:11:00,488
Scott: right number one easy to read, but not so easy to read.

173
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:01,190
Scott: It's insignificant.

174
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,390
Scott: I mean, I guess I could have chosen Cat in the Hat, but you know that's a little prince is easy to read.

175
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:06,873
Scott: That's a good.

176
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:07,738
Rym: doesn't make it bad.

177
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,765
Scott: Maybe I'll do it next time.

178
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:13,024
Scott: um yeah But this is you know be warned the shorter books you pick the longer ones.

179
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:21,310
Scott: I will pick in retaliation This is easier to read, but you know significant still enough book to be significant in quality.

180
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:25,986
Scott: Also, it's a fantasy book which nerds like right.

181
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:29,539
Scott: third It's sort of like one of those like forgot.

182
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:29,740
Scott: It's.

183
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,710
Scott: it's weird because it's sort of like the odd fantasy series out.

184
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:35,509
Scott: it's like you got the Lord of the Rings and you got your.

185
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:38,406
Scott: What's it called your what?

186
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:40,681
Scott: Narnia's.

187
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:47,835
Scott: And then the Earthsea is sort of like the in-between and it's not like totally forgotten like people know it But it's not super big.

188
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:50,124
Scott: you know it's definitely not Harry Potter big either.

189
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:59,557
Rym: I guess that's fantasy even though I'm gonna say it straight up Harry Potter I'm not gonna say it drew It's poop from this at all sucks.

190
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:05,577
Rym: if you want a story about a young boy going to wizard school and becoming a wizard Harry Potter is not the story.

191
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:09,249
Scott: I think I think actually you know if you do like the it.

192
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,790
Scott: It's sort of like a Naruto thing right Naruto.

193
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:22,050
Scott: They start out with ninja school, but the ninja school is gone after like five episodes right in Where Earthsea right at least in this first book the wizard school is there for a bit?

194
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,953
Scott: you know it's Mostly the whole.

195
00:12:24,973 --> 00:12:28,808
Scott: if you look at the whole series the wizard school is like nothing in Harry Potter at least.

196
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:32,758
Scott: I haven't read You know more than part of one book of it Which I can't.

197
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:37,454
Scott: I can't either, but I can watch the movies My understanding of it.

198
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:40,002
Scott: Is that the majority of it is wizard school.

199
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:42,430
Scott: You know it's like with the wizard school.

200
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,212
Scott: Is the setting?

201
00:12:43,252 --> 00:12:49,270
Scott: this is a world setting where a wizard school is one thing in the world setting oh?

202
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:52,130
Scott: Having trouble there hello little belt burping anyway.

203
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:59,469
Scott: The other reason I chose this book is because there was a terrible sci-fi miniseries based on it.

204
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:05,864
Scott: There were that was not the only bad No, no based on and there was a Studio Ghibli not a Miyazaki movie.

205
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:07,088
Scott: What wasn't a Miyazaki son.

206
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:11,627
Scott: Yes It was a Studio Ghibli movie based on this series.

207
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:23,029
Scott: We're not gonna talk I haven't seen no, but you know it's I think The author of the book Ursula K. Le Guin who is the amazing sci-fi fantasy author of all time.

208
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:29,914
Scott: She plain didn't like the sci-fi thing and and get I thank you I think ghetto thank you.

209
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:32,924
Scott: I think she said if I remember correctly.

210
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:34,650
Scott: She said she didn't say it was good or bad.

211
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,704
Scott: She's just said you know it's his it's not mine.

212
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:39,212
Scott: You know it's his store You know.

213
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:40,116
Scott: so I don't.

214
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:43,210
Scott: I don't get the feeling she wasn't like a huge fan of it either.

215
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,581
Scott: So you know this thing that people are trying to make works of.

216
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:51,989
Scott: I think people should be encouraged to read the real deal Lest they you know get bad ideas about it.

217
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:58,330
Scott: It's really the people trying to adapt this thing or the failed and it's not a matter of the original thing being failed.

218
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,049
Rym: Well, what has been said of ghetto Sankey primarily is that it?

219
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:02,250
Scott: Yeah?

220
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:08,930
Rym: I haven't seen it, but people have said that it has nothing to do with Earthsea except that they call the guy dead.

221
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:12,141
Scott: Well, I think let's to start right off the bat right.

222
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:20,075
Scott: the first thing that the miniseries And I'm pretty sure good Sankey get wrong is They make get white.

223
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:21,398
Scott: he's not white.

224
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:25,310
Scott: almost no one in this book is white except the jerk barbarian invaders.

225
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:30,690
Scott: The jerk barbarians invaders are basically just Vikings right there white and blonde and the bad people in the north who?

226
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:32,796
Rym: Knew where the stone is?

227
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:33,700
Scott: yeah, they were.

228
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,865
Scott: why is the stone right?

229
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:36,150
Scott: the enchantress chick right?

230
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:37,116
Scott: She was white or the?

231
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,425
Scott: no she was like the enchants his daughter I don't know, and I think the art the archmage was white.

232
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:44,690
Scott: ish mostly white.

233
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:49,150
Scott: But everyone else in this book is like black or like you know dark.

234
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:54,328
Rym: Well, they make the distinction between between the brown black and the red black.

235
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:56,074
Scott: yeah I sort of imagined it.

236
00:14:56,094 --> 00:15:00,069
Scott: my mind is like you know like the Native American color and then like an African color.

237
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:01,644
Scott: You know sort of like that.

238
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:06,530
Scott: Anyway, it's just really interesting because you don't think you know most fantasy stuff.

239
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,930
Scott: I mean look at the Lord of the Rings right everyone.

240
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,062
Scott: It's all I do all white dudes right and it's like the book isn't about.

241
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:13,624
Rym: think about it.

242
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,590
Rym: Scott Gandalf the white.

243
00:15:16,153 --> 00:15:17,966
Scott: Well, he's also getting up the gray.

244
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:25,809
Scott: No white Yeah, but I mean the only things that aren't white are like you know fucking orcs and elves and shit also.

245
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:26,779
Rym: I note that.

246
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:29,947
Rym: anyway I'm not gonna make all the jokes I could make.

247
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:37,199
Scott: no But I think what's really interesting about it right is norm like if you went to the movie theater And you watch like a medieval you know a fantasy movie.

248
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:44,219
Scott: We're like the powerful wizards were like you know African Americans Suddenly like race would be an issue in that.

249
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,870
Scott: but like in the book race is not an issue.

250
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:47,575
Scott: They just sort of.

251
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:48,360
Scott: it's just part.

252
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,743
Scott: It's just like.

253
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:49,568
Scott: yeah, the people aren't white.

254
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:52,783
Scott: well I think they don't make a deal out of it has no effect on the story.

255
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:55,176
Scott: race is not an issue at all It's just that's.

256
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:57,250
Scott: the people are different colors of course.

257
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:07,552
Rym: I think part of the reason we see this sort of thing is that most Western style fantasy is set in a generically Western medieval Medieval.

258
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:22,518
Scott: you know medieval times were in Europe where white people lived and so when you think of you know actual medieval stuff you think of you know European people and fantasy worlds tend to be you know Medieval European worlds plus magic, but at

259
00:16:22,538 --> 00:16:32,947
Rym: the same time I feel like someone who reads this book and doesn't pay attention Would just automatically assume that the characters were white or at least were the same color as them because it doesn't.

260
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:42,793
Scott: if you're a western Person probably it just don't read carefully and realize you know the two words that say his skin was dark red Because it only gets mentioned a couple of times course That's actually.

261
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:57,364
Rym: the thing I find most interesting about this book is because I'll admit Part of the reason I was looking forward to this is that despite all the wide reading I've done I'd never actually read any of the Earthsea books, and I was really not familiar with Ursula K Le Guin style of writing at all.

262
00:16:57,525 --> 00:17:04,371
Rym: and This book is I mean a lot of people would say it's at the level of a middle schooler and that anyone can read this Book.

263
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,233
Scott: well you know the.

264
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:07,119
Scott: the reading level is middle school.

265
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:16,252
Scott: a middle school kid could read it understand the story and possibly even You know read between the lines a bit, but at the same time part of that, and it's appropriate Subject material.

266
00:17:16,273 --> 00:17:31,689
Rym: it's not because it writes or I guess reads down to anyone and it doesn't even shy away from Difficult words or very very subtle interplay, but it's not like Harry Potter where the writing is simplistic and terrible.

267
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:37,100
Rym: I'm sorry, but those books are written so badly like it bothers me.

268
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:41,310
Rym: every pair every word just like burns into my soul.

269
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:47,630
Rym: But the style of this book is very terse very to the point and it's very descriptive.

270
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,976
Rym: but it's not descriptive of Ged it does.

271
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:59,550
Rym: it kind of is like you're being told the story of Ged From a far and from a far future.

272
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:01,556
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely.

273
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:02,078
Scott: you know how.

274
00:18:02,218 --> 00:18:12,266
Scott: in like the Hobbit right you know in the at the end of the Hobbit you sort of get Bilbo writing the Hobbit thing going on and it's like am I reading the book that Bilbo wrote?

275
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:13,810
Scott: or am I reading someone telling me?

276
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,575
Scott: About Bilbo writing the book?

277
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:19,507
Scott: get this you know that sort of situation, but this is clearly.

278
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:22,339
Scott: you know Someone who.

279
00:18:22,762 --> 00:18:23,204
Scott: it's weird.

280
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:31,076
Scott: It's almost like this omniscient narrator right who and They're telling you what really happened.

281
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:34,907
Scott: like they know right, but there are books in the.

282
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:39,661
Scott: you know in the history of the world in which this takes place in the history of the world of Earthsea.

283
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:40,805
Scott: you know Ged.

284
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:42,069
Scott: the main character here is.

285
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:46,686
Scott: You know like he is the Gandalf he is the big bad wizard.

286
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:47,730
Scott: This is not like a spoiler.

287
00:18:47,810 --> 00:19:00,321
Scott: They tell you this right up front right that you know Ged is like the ultimate Wizard in the history of this world like you know the major Historical figure and you're getting his story from the beginning here, and he's.

288
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:00,682
Scott: you know that.

289
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:10,078
Scott: so in that world where this is great wizard Obviously later on there become books in this world about the great wizard Just like we have books in our world about.

290
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:13,150
Scott: you know great generals and historical figures.

291
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:21,250
Scott: You know so this narrator will say things like oh yeah, and then this happened But you won't find that in the tales of Ged.

292
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,802
Scott: You know as if the tales of Ged are a book that exists in the world.

293
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:25,284
Scott: It's it's.

294
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:26,789
Scott: it's pretty cool.

295
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:37,032
Rym: Yes Well, I particularly like how many times there and this could be done to very poor effect and I'm sure there are a lot of authors who have done this poorly, but It'll always.

296
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:45,149
Rym: the book always gives little asides and says things like Ged sees a certain land in the distance from a ship and As an aside the narrator's informs you.

297
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:50,630
Rym: But it wouldn't be for many years that he actually set foot in those lands and saw the blah blah blahs of blah blah blah.

298
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:56,708
Scott: Yeah, most actually what they was talking about there was the tombs of Atuan which is the second book the second book he goes to.

299
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,723
Rym: the Mentioned that that's actually the second part.

300
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:04,867
Rym: That's with the Old people living on that shoal in the middle of nowhere.

301
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:07,199
Rym: Yeah now I was speaking of on the very beginning of the book.

302
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:08,567
Rym: There's a whole other thing they remember.

303
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:16,110
Rym: they reference Mm-hmm, but it happens often, and it's done very well into very good effect and you get you.

304
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:18,958
Rym: It's interesting how you a lot of books will.

305
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:23,230
Rym: you'll know how they end or at least you know that the main characters will succeed.

306
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:30,415
Rym: But yet at the same time you're full of suspense as to whether or not they will succeed, but this book I was never like.

307
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:36,209
Rym: I know they'll succeed and I know Absolutely, and I never doubt it, and I never have that suspense.

308
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:37,899
Rym: Instead I mostly.

309
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:48,519
Rym: I read it the same way I read a history book in that I'm desperate to find out how he succeeds and why and what happens and what the story was Mmm, but it was never a question of will he make it.

310
00:20:49,021 --> 00:20:49,683
Scott: Hey, he's good.

311
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:51,329
Scott: There's a bunch more books.

312
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:52,654
Scott: Yes He's gonna make it.

313
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:58,469
Rym: you know it says so straight up, but there are books where I know they make it But yet, I still fear for the characters.

314
00:20:58,711 --> 00:20:59,174
Scott: Yeah, there are.

315
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:01,327
Rym: this book does not do that, and I think it's a strong point.

316
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:02,372
Scott: for well I think it's.

317
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:06,869
Scott: I fear for some of the characters, but not you know they don't all make it.

318
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,309
Scott: No, they don't all make it.

319
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,462
Scott: But you know the ones you know that are gonna make it are gonna make it.

320
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:12,045
Scott: the others are.

321
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:13,350
Scott: you know more momentary.

322
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,685
Scott: But Rym what is the one thing I always complain about in?

323
00:21:16,745 --> 00:21:25,130
Rym: you know fantasy books god You always will read a fantasy book And there's the awesome old wizard and you hear the stories about the awesome old days when the awesome old wizard is an awesome.

324
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,445
Rym: That's right, but the book is always about today when everything sucks exactly right.

325
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:30,790
Scott: you read the fantasy book right?

326
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:37,870
Scott: And it's like the all these characters like the Knights and the Wizards will be saying Back in the day with the old powers.

327
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:41,463
Scott: You know the old powers are always stronger than the new powers.

328
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:43,430
Scott: back in the day there were dragons everywhere.

329
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:46,223
Scott: Nowadays if you find a dragon in a cave you're lucky.

330
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:50,286
Rym: you know of course There's the prince of nothing which takes the take of look.

331
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:54,822
Rym: Everything in the old days was great, and then everything went to crap and you know what.

332
00:21:55,204 --> 00:21:58,594
Rym: the old days are back right now This is the new old days.

333
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:01,082
Scott: That's true, but this book right.

334
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:03,850
Scott: there is some amount of old days in this book.

335
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:11,010
Scott: You know they used to be more dragons and such, but this book is the story of get who is the Gandalf.

336
00:22:11,191 --> 00:22:15,250
Scott: It's like you don't really hear them talking about like oh this great old wizard.

337
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:17,590
Scott: There aren't a lot of names of historical figures.

338
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,463
Scott: They don't talk about Kate great kings of the past or and when anything like that.

339
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:27,336
Rym: when they do that the interesting part is it's always Indirectly and you never get these.

340
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:28,721
Rym: it's not like it's hulkin book where

341
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:39,650
Scott: like you don't even know like you know you sort of get The idea that there's these islands in the middle sort of where there are great kingdoms or like you know the bellies the biggest kingdoms Around but they don't like really talk about them.

342
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,140
Scott: They don't really have an effect so much really.

343
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,338
Scott: you know it like maybe couple times They mentioned like oh, yeah, not like in.

344
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:50,910
Scott: you know a very civilized highly densely populated place like this island.

345
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:59,482
Rym: You know oh, but no what I'm saying is that when you hear about history in the context of this book You don't hear about it directly.

346
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:14,450
Rym: you hear about it indirectly through the times when it is noted that a character or a group of people were singing the tales of ancient days the Verbal unwritten stories that are not widely known throughout the entire world of Earthsea.

347
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:21,150
Rym: Yeah, and it's very you know burning wheel the songs of the elves the songs of the ages or Tolkien the songs of the ages.

348
00:23:21,256 --> 00:23:23,239
Rym: but What it really evokes?

349
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:33,584
Rym: maybe partly because I just finished reading that History of the Peloponnesian Wars as seen from the Persian side even though it totally copped out and just talks about the Greeks for like this all second half.

350
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:47,724
Rym: but It talks a lot about the idea that the Greeks during the Peloponnesian War period the history they had before that Was so steeped in myth that it wasn't even a history like what they looked at.

351
00:23:47,764 --> 00:23:49,950
Rym: his history was the Odyssey

352
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,013
Scott: Cyclope

353
00:23:51,174 --> 00:24:14,469
Rym: and the Iliad and the Trojan War and things that barely ever even existed The fact that their actual history was so new that it went back to purely Mythological origins or origins so lost a time that all you had left were these kind of fantastic stories of you know heroes from the age of heroes and the Trojan Wars and all that sort of thing.

354
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:17,297
Rym: and This world feels that old.

355
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:23,664
Rym: it feels like I mean most fantasy books are kind of Middle Ages But this one feels more like Greek Ages.

356
00:24:23,704 --> 00:24:24,770
Rym: You've got archipelagos.

357
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:30,610
Rym: You've got you know ord ships with barely a concept of how to truly use sails.

358
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:35,704
Scott: Yeah, boats are really really important and like you know they have sails, but they're not.

359
00:24:35,945 --> 00:24:39,990
Scott: you know good sails like in a British Navy, it's just mostly flat sheets.

360
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,395
Scott: And then Wizards do you know?

361
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:45,629
Scott: move the wind to keep the boats going sail wise rather than?

362
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:49,389
Scott: You know and mostly just to keep the boats from sinking not to make them go fast.

363
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:54,990
Rym: So they've definitely they've got trireme style technology here and their armor and weapons.

364
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:56,618
Rym: What little is known about them.

365
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:58,427
Rym: whenever you know things like that aren't brought up.

366
00:24:58,547 --> 00:24:58,849
Rym: often are?

367
00:24:59,592 --> 00:25:04,388
Rym: Clearly bronze made for the most part except for the few iron wielders And it's very much.

368
00:25:04,892 --> 00:25:12,869
Rym: This is more early Greek history than middle European history Which does really lend itself to the fact that not every peep there aren't really white people.

369
00:25:14,192 --> 00:25:17,728
Rym: Yeah, I just I like the fact that the setting is different like that.

370
00:25:19,492 --> 00:25:24,436
Scott: But anyway as I was saying I'm always looking for you know Where is the story of?

371
00:25:24,496 --> 00:25:28,430
Scott: you know the great times the Golden Age when you know there was the most?

372
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,694
Scott: Magic going around.

373
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:31,560
Scott: and you know the Silmarillion sort of offers that.

374
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,690
Scott: but the Silmarillion isn't really a character narrative.

375
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:38,550
Scott: It's more like you know a few separate short stories.

376
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:45,630
Scott: It reads almost like a you know like the Bible sort of disjointed and all these separate parts that don't really flow.

377
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:49,305
Rym: I'll be honest the what happens in the times of this?

378
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:52,195
Rym: what the Silmarillion Basically amount to?

379
00:25:52,657 --> 00:26:00,830
Rym: epic level characters with a million balrogs and dragons And we're all playing 10th level characters, we're all like Gandalf the Grey.

380
00:26:01,051 --> 00:26:04,225
Rym: We're going around and then the DM says this is boring.

381
00:26:04,506 --> 00:26:08,540
Rym: Let's play epic level Let's all be 40th level badasses fighting other 40th level.

382
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:08,961
Rym: Well.

383
00:26:09,222 --> 00:26:11,750
Scott: I forged the greatest artifacts of all time.

384
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:13,318
Scott: So great.

385
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:14,609
Scott: They'll be in the players handbook.

386
00:26:15,154 --> 00:26:17,210
Rym: No, but that's what I got from the Silmarillion.

387
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:22,414
Scott: Yeah, but Earthsea tells you the story of the wizard I mean get.

388
00:26:22,474 --> 00:26:28,642
Scott: is the wizard the number one you know I mean He's got people who are above him at least during the story.

389
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:30,750
Scott: right you've got og on who's fucking awesome?

390
00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:31,957
Rym: Hey, he's the man.

391
00:26:31,977 --> 00:26:32,681
Scott: Oh John is.

392
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:33,245
Scott: oh John.

393
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:34,070
Scott: I think is my favorite.

394
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,940
Rym: He reminds me of Odin so much.

395
00:26:37,342 --> 00:26:39,590
Scott: kind of he's definitely my favorite character in the whole book.

396
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,495
Scott: Yeah, yeah, so he's all quiet But like he's super.

397
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:47,270
Scott: well anyone who's super wise like that always gets you like the quiet wise one.

398
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:50,409
Scott: I like the quiet wise ones a lot because you're another quiet nor wise.

399
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:52,889
Scott: No, I'm wise.

400
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:58,190
Scott: And You got the guys at the wizard school right who run it.

401
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:01,923
Scott: And I think you know the best of which is probably my second favorite character the doorkeeper.

402
00:27:02,345 --> 00:27:06,795
Scott: ah the doorkeeper right And you know they're.

403
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:10,250
Scott: they're you know great wizards at all greater than get is at the moment.

404
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:16,009
Scott: but it's like they all recognize that get is like either gonna be like the worst thing ever or the best thing ever.

405
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:18,598
Scott: and You know while they're great wizards.

406
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:21,330
Scott: They're not like all-powerful can't stop me now.

407
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:31,830
Scott: They're just strong wizards and magic while it can do a lot isn't Super strong and it usually has a high price and requires a great deal of knowledge.

408
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,657
Rym: But they don't do it.

409
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:50,839
Rym: the feeling of that and like the sense you get of The state of the world and the fact that these wizards as powerful as they are are not super powerful I think also harkens back to the the setting in the time period and that the whole feel of the book is much Older than almost all fantasy books I read.

410
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,423
Rym: it's set in a tie.

411
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:59,710
Rym: it feels so ancient like very little came before it Mmm, and then like that more than anything defines this book.

412
00:28:03,094 --> 00:28:06,470
Rym: Of course that might just be the fact that I've been reading a lot of Greek history lately.

413
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:07,253
Scott: It could be.

414
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:09,422
Scott: you always seem to whatever you read lately.

415
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:11,289
Scott: you always tie into everything else you do.

416
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:17,575
Rym: But at the same time it is true that the setting is very Greek like early Like other books.

417
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:27,099
Scott: right they like they'll talk about the time of a billion dragons, right and when they talk about it it feels like there was a civilization then and That you know, it's now.

418
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,710
Scott: we're just farther on in the civilization.

419
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:46,910
Scott: Yes You look you really feels like in the times that are older than this book when there were a lot of dragons there wasn't really civilization as much and even now a lot of places like you know that he goes to that place for a time near the Dragon Mountain whatever where it's really not that civilized.

420
00:28:47,972 --> 00:28:59,630
Scott: It's like a bunch of little separate islands and each person lives on one island and you know They're they're not doing too well and it's very sort of you know, it's like once one or two steps past cave people.

421
00:29:00,432 --> 00:29:05,344
Scott: Yeah, and the only place that really has civilization at all is is the Magic School.

422
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,309
Scott: every other place is sort of like, you know

423
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:24,384
Rym: It's kind of like when you look at the the same setting well setting the same time period of the real world where there were civilizations that came before but there were a few far between and are so lost to history and shrouded that they're already Barely legends to the people who live.

424
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:30,749
Scott: Mm-hmm And it almost feels like you know, the time of the a lot of dragons in this book is almost like the time of dinosaurs.

425
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:38,117
Scott: You know in the real world, it's like yeah, there used to be a bunch of dinosaurs or dragons or whatever But there was no one around then.

426
00:29:38,197 --> 00:29:41,450
Scott: so it's not really an interesting time to talk about as much.

427
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:54,188
Rym: I just I definitely get the sense that reading because I haven't read nothing else this is the book that talks about kind of the dawn of civilization on a true scale and like that's the point where the world really starts changing.

428
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:58,744
Rym: and then If it were a standard fantasy book, it takes place like a hundred years after this book.

429
00:29:58,964 --> 00:29:59,245
Scott: Yep.

430
00:29:59,265 --> 00:29:59,466
Scott: Yep.

431
00:29:59,486 --> 00:30:02,497
Scott: Yep All right, let's talk about.

432
00:30:02,537 --> 00:30:04,348
Scott: let's talk about some interesting scenes, right.

433
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:14,378
Rym: So one stuff was could anyone but a middle schooler be surprised that all he had to do the beat the shadow Spoilers, by the way Was say his own name.

434
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,630
Scott: Well, no, they sorta it's it's alright.

435
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:24,790
Rym: So let's talk about the main plot thread here Which I just want to say was obvious the moment the dragon said he knew what the thing's name was.

436
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:28,030
Scott: I knew I knew before then but maybe that's because it's the second time I've read.

437
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:31,058
Scott: No, so check this out, right?

438
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,390
Scott: So normally when you have like a hero character Especially someone who's like try to think for a second, right?

439
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,150
Scott: You only ever see Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings when he's old and already powerful, right?

440
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:44,521
Scott: Do you ever try to think about like what the history of Gandalf was?

441
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:45,786
Scott: Like what was Gandalf growing up?

442
00:30:46,288 --> 00:30:46,810
Scott: How about Merlin?

443
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,350
Scott: What was Merlin like I guess growing down, right?

444
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:51,322
Scott: What was it like?

445
00:30:51,362 --> 00:30:51,686
Scott: was he?

446
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:58,513
Rym: well I have read Elminster making of a mage and by the way if any of you have seen this book burn it Burn it.

447
00:30:58,674 --> 00:30:59,016
Scott: All right.

448
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:00,744
Scott: So what was Elminster like when he grew up?

449
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:01,990
Scott: Did he go to like a little wizard school?

450
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,149
Scott: Was he a punk?

451
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,054
Rym: Yes, you know what?

452
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:15,710
Rym: I'm pretty sure that Elminster making of mage was stolen Wholesale from a wizard of Earthsea really and in fact, I feel cheapened for having read that book.

453
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:17,515
Scott: See cuz that's one thing.

454
00:31:17,535 --> 00:31:27,230
Scott: you when you try to if you see someone who's wise and great right someone who's like the mage Right you think about their history and you can only fill it with like wiseness and greatness.

455
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,323
Scott: But I can't you can't imagine.

456
00:31:29,384 --> 00:31:44,030
Scott: possibly look at this You're the greatest wizard in this entire world ever like the most major historical figure and in his early days Just some like country bumpkin kid right who furthermore and then when he went to cuz it done fucked up, right?

457
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,756
Scott: And then he fucks up twice.

458
00:31:45,957 --> 00:32:00,264
Scott: He gets fooled a bunch of times right and when he goes to wizard school He's totally prideful and ass ish, you know, even though and they give you that other character Jasper Right, who is like it's to show you this contrast of like look.

459
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,535
Scott: Here's the typical Prideful asshole guy.

460
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:06,804
Scott: what normally happens when there's a prideful asshole guy in a book?

461
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:11,978
Scott: Well, he ends up failing in the end He didn't get his wizard staff and he is the lose right.

462
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:23,089
Scott: but here they competing with him is the other prideful guy again, which is so atypical for you know, some a character like that, especially the main good guy character to be all prideful and whatever.

463
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,696
Scott: and What happens to him?

464
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:27,744
Scott: Oh, he totally makes it in the end.

465
00:32:27,764 --> 00:32:28,467
Scott: Yeah, it's all good.

466
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:30,816
Scott: All right Where else do you see the story like that?

467
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:31,438
Scott: I don't see one.

468
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,298
Rym: Well in Al Minster making of a man No, but what happens?

469
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:36,539
Scott: right?

470
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,866
Scott: the main plot thread right?

471
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,855
Scott: He Cast this spell.

472
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,465
Scott: he shouldn't be doing so, you know, he's up to no good right.

473
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:45,736
Scott: a bad monster shows up But oh John saves him right and warns him.

474
00:32:45,776 --> 00:32:46,639
Scott: so he's right.

475
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:53,302
Scott: then later on right probably still he's get you know Half of him is all nice and cool, right?

476
00:32:53,342 --> 00:32:55,470
Scott: And that's you know, he's got the two friends at wizards.

477
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,373
Scott: Go on out friends.

478
00:32:56,454 --> 00:33:04,057
Scott: One of Jasper is not his friend, but you got Jasper and you know vetch Australian or yeah Whatever.

479
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:05,385
Rym: You shouldn't say his true name.

480
00:33:05,587 --> 00:33:06,130
Scott: I know right?

481
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:12,392
Scott: Yes, we'll talk about that in a minute, right and that's sort of like you combine them and you get get at that point Right.

482
00:33:12,452 --> 00:33:14,364
Scott: half of him is like the wise awesome.

483
00:33:14,445 --> 00:33:14,787
Scott: Cool.

484
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:18,790
Scott: Good Friendly loving dude and half of him is the prideful asshole, dude.

485
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:22,699
Scott: And then you know He cast the spell and the black monster.

486
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:25,027
Scott: he comes out when he's doing something you shouldn't do.

487
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:25,689
Scott: and what?

488
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,614
Scott: Obviously the metaphor.

489
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:31,149
Scott: and as soon as from that point on he does learn his lesson.

490
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,570
Scott: now He's just you know good and smart and not prideful or assholes anymore.

491
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:42,630
Scott: Obviously all that pridefulness and ash holiness went into the black monstery shadow thing, which is now separate from him.

492
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:45,669
Rym: You know, and of course they keep bringing up to the whole book.

493
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:51,910
Rym: Well, they Ursula K Le Guin keeps bringing up through the whole book that there can't be darkness without light and light without darkness.

494
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,417
Rym: You can't have words without silence and silence without words.

495
00:33:54,878 --> 00:33:57,605
Rym: both sides needed come together whole.

496
00:33:57,886 --> 00:34:10,290
Scott: it's the typical Adam warlock You know from Marvel Comics story where all the magus comes out and it's the good side and the bad side Are split up into two separate beings and and in the end they had to combine and whatever, you know, it's funny.

497
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:18,746
Rym: I just watched an old episode of South Park that I just must have never watched Where Cartman has that exact same thing happened to him as evil Cartman and good Cartman.

498
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:24,487
Rym: they split up and those They they don't actually split into two, but there's the inner battle and it's hilarious.

499
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:30,250
Rym: the inner battle Ah, but the inner battle spills out into the real world in a hilarious way away, right?

500
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,815
Scott: This is an inner battle.

501
00:34:31,855 --> 00:34:36,509
Scott: the shadow while it sort of has a manifestation isn't really a being.

502
00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:39,550
Scott: you know As soon as he decides I'm gonna go and get this shadow.

503
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,597
Scott: Yeah, the shadows on the run.

504
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:44,107
Scott: Well, why would the shadows suddenly be on the run?

505
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:48,770
Scott: it if it was, you know It was much more powerful than he was because it's actually inside of him.

506
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,563
Scott: It's not really, you know, this this outside being.

507
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:57,730
Scott: that's why he just sort of you know He's following his gut feeling when he's chasing it down because he's chasing it down inside of himself.

508
00:34:57,811 --> 00:34:59,147
Scott: He's not actually chasing that.

509
00:34:59,188 --> 00:35:06,936
Scott: well He is and he isn't actually chasing down a physical magical thing to because I don't think to chase it down He leaves all magic.

510
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:11,895
Rym: he gets to the edge of the world to where there's all pretty much no magic or anything He's known before.

511
00:35:11,915 --> 00:35:13,686
Scott: Yeah, there's more about the edge of the world later.

512
00:35:13,706 --> 00:35:21,910
Scott: Yeah I figured and I mean he even goes to like, you know death's door to I guess You know chase down slash get away from this thing.

513
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,430
Scott: Like when he's saving like he's trying to save that kid's life and he pretty much goes all the way.

514
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:26,611
Scott: It's.

515
00:35:26,711 --> 00:35:31,230
Scott: it's sort of like a Fullmetal Alchemist you go all the way to the evil door and then you call that evil door.

516
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:34,018
Rym: I was disappointed with what that evil door was when.

517
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,603
Scott: well in Fullmetal Alchemist.

518
00:35:35,623 --> 00:35:37,809
Scott: I was disappointed but in Earthsea I was not.

519
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:44,319
Scott: now it's like when he's you know going down and like, you know, the kids getting away and he's like And then he does that whole.

520
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,670
Scott: it like getting there is real quick.

521
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:57,130
Scott: But then like there's that law it's like a couple pages Describing how he gets back from like the land of death where he's like It's like he's walking uphill in sand and every step is harder than the last.

522
00:35:57,654 --> 00:36:05,936
Scott: It really it reminds me of like a lot of those D&D worlds were like, you know, the demons are trying to escape from you know Whatever demon world it is in the farther away.

523
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:14,090
Scott: They get this more gravity pulling him back and it's you know, it's it's it's pretty good And I think that the and it's sort of like the same thing.

524
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,505
Scott: It's like when he goes to the end of the world.

525
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:21,944
Scott: at the end of the book It really feels like he's going to the death's door that he was at before like it's.

526
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:27,610
Scott: you could imagine it being the same place But I'm not quite sure because I don't remember the other books as much.

527
00:36:30,412 --> 00:36:38,104
Rym: So so it's well I can say this and I can say this openly It's a fantastic book and anyone.

528
00:36:38,366 --> 00:36:42,167
Rym: of course you've all read it But you should convince other people to read and you should if you like.

529
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,015
Scott: the book There's like a whole bunch more.

530
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:46,203
Scott: There's like tombs of ahtuan and tahanu.

531
00:36:46,263 --> 00:36:47,950
Scott: It takes four hours to read.

532
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:50,264
Scott: Yeah, it's I mean and it's cheap too.

533
00:36:50,284 --> 00:36:51,170
Scott: What was it on Amazon?

534
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,580
Scott: I mean I bought it at the bookstore for like eight dollars.

535
00:36:53,741 --> 00:36:56,292
Scott: All right, that was the bookstore price Amazon price Course.

536
00:36:56,333 --> 00:37:06,110
Scott: I know that the book you bought Earthsea now an original miniseries event More expensive one there and I felt like thing is I already owned all the books, but someone has them.

537
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:12,715
Scott: I don't know who has them and So I had to go and buy another one real quick cuz I was like, oh shit The show was on Thursday crap.

538
00:37:12,756 --> 00:37:17,966
Scott: So on one day I went to get it and then I read it Monday Tuesday room What Wednesday Thursday and that was that?

539
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,997
Rym: Do we have anything else more to say about this book?

540
00:37:22,057 --> 00:37:25,650
Rym: I mean it's short enough to where other than saying man that scene was awesome.

541
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:28,280
Scott: I got a few that scenes was awesome.

542
00:37:28,802 --> 00:37:35,300
Scott: one right when he's in the wizard school, right and That like the master patterner right and they don't tell you what goes on.

543
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,283
Scott: that a lot.

544
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:38,930
Scott: It's like yeah, there's that Grove, right?

545
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,797
Scott: Chekhov's gun with the Grove right?

546
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:44,128
Scott: You can't get to the Grove of Illidan, you know.

547
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:47,890
Scott: You can go there later and then later he finally gets to go to the Grove of Illidan.

548
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:52,190
Rym: And it's literally like he went to the Grove and learned many things and came out of the Grove.

549
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:54,458
Scott: Yeah, it's like oh the master patterner was there.

550
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:56,566
Scott: the things he teaches you they're sort of crazy.

551
00:37:56,586 --> 00:38:02,850
Scott: and in one way I felt like it was a cop-out like didn't want to describe what the master patterner does and never you know.

552
00:38:03,233 --> 00:38:04,830
Scott: But on the other hand, it's like whoa.

553
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:07,735
Scott: They still kept it a secret from us.

554
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:13,130
Scott: this omniscient narrator kept a secret from us what goes on in the Grove of Illidan.

555
00:38:13,331 --> 00:38:13,975
Scott: It's like that's.

556
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:14,739
Scott: that's some pretty rough.

557
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,166
Rym: There are things you shouldn't know.

558
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:20,070
Scott: now I guess there are also the whole thing with the doorkeeper, right?

559
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,956
Scott: It's like you think about.

560
00:38:21,976 --> 00:38:24,625
Scott: if you think about what the doorkeeper does even more.

561
00:38:24,645 --> 00:38:27,933
Scott: It's like he really is The doorkeeper.

562
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,097
Scott: cuz think right in this world.

563
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:31,244
Scott: We got to talk about you know, the true names of things.

564
00:38:31,324 --> 00:38:35,077
Scott: right to have security Right, especially at a wizard school.

565
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:38,490
Scott: They got to know the names of all these wizard kids, right?

566
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,729
Scott: Otherwise they you know, the wizard kids can go nuts and they got nothing on them.

567
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:45,590
Scott: So to get into the wizard school, he's got to tell the doorkeepers real name.

568
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:48,988
Rym: But you can only get your true name if someone tells it to you.

569
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:51,710
Scott: Well that you get it, you know earlier in life.

570
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,995
Scott: It's like you know bar mitzvah.

571
00:38:53,015 --> 00:38:54,320
Rym: someone tells it but you have to get me.

572
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,730
Rym: he was given his name by the Grey Wizard.

573
00:38:56,931 --> 00:38:57,332
Scott: That's true.

574
00:38:57,353 --> 00:38:57,714
Scott: That's true.

575
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:03,719
Scott: So, you know, he goes and when he goes into the wizard school He's got to give up his name to the wizard school.

576
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:06,310
Scott: That's in, you know, ensuring the security of the wizard school.

577
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,625
Rym: It's kind of like how our IT wouldn't give your transcript back if you still owe them money.

578
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,614
Scott: exactly exactly Right.

579
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,865
Scott: and then on the way out.

580
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:19,109
Scott: you got it, you know The doorkeeper won't let you out until you tell him his name.

581
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,098
Scott: You know, it's like you figured my name out.

582
00:39:21,138 --> 00:39:21,801
Scott: now you can leave.

583
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:31,537
Scott: and it's like as soon as you go in the wizard school You give up all your freedom in exchange for you know, the incredible learnings and power, you know It's like that's the price you pay.

584
00:39:31,557 --> 00:39:35,767
Scott: and then you can get your freedom back, you know sort of once you proved you're the real deal.

585
00:39:35,788 --> 00:39:43,690
Scott: and then you know how he when he just do any figure and he figures out the name of the doorkeeper to get out and he like he basically says like.

586
00:39:44,212 --> 00:39:45,277
Scott: He says the cleverest thing.

587
00:39:45,297 --> 00:39:46,803
Scott: He's like you keep an hour.

588
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:48,430
Scott: He's like you keep a narrow door.

589
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:50,123
Scott: Let me go sit and grow thinner.

590
00:39:50,164 --> 00:39:50,869
Scott: So may I pass?

591
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,109
Rym: Yeah, but then he comes back and says well, I can't figure it out.

592
00:39:54,290 --> 00:40:00,670
Scott: He's like I can guess and I can't kill you to get through but I'll leave if you'll answer one question for me.

593
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:01,828
Scott: Yeah, what's your name?

594
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,499
Scott: It's like oh so and it totally works.

595
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:06,710
Scott: and it's like they don't even tell you the dude's name.

596
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,132
Scott: They're just like.

597
00:40:07,213 --> 00:40:10,348
Scott: and he told him his name and he repeated it back to him and then he walked out.

598
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:12,413
Scott: I like that part.

599
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:17,550
Rym: Yeah, plus I like the way true names are taken kind of to an extra extent here.

600
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,558
Scott: Secondary like I don't know.

601
00:40:21,578 --> 00:40:30,450
Scott: I think it's maybe not even a secondary but like the other primary You know theme of the book the fact that the world itself is nothing more than the slowly spoken words of the stars.

602
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,200
Scott: Yeah, yeah pretty much.

603
00:40:32,502 --> 00:40:33,669
Scott: I mean and think about that, right?

604
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:43,723
Scott: So the true names of things like hold power, you know when you say any true names of things Right aren't just there is not like some objective name thing.

605
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:45,228
Scott: It's the names of things.

606
00:40:45,328 --> 00:40:47,377
Scott: as dragon It's the dragon language, right?

607
00:40:47,598 --> 00:40:50,090
Scott: Whatever dragons call things is what they are.

608
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:57,949
Rym: I really like the fact though that because dragons converse in the old tongue They are the only beings that know how to lie in it.

609
00:40:58,297 --> 00:41:04,530
Rym: Yeah Humans because because of their nature can only speak the truth in that tongue because it's the tongue that truly names things.

610
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:12,422
Scott: It's like if you're saying the true names of things you can't possibly lie But a dragon can because they're older and smarter than you.

611
00:41:12,643 --> 00:41:16,597
Scott: and by saying the true names of things That's where the magic comes from right.

612
00:41:16,617 --> 00:41:20,210
Scott: you say the name of a rock, you know to to get power over that rock.

613
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,350
Scott: It's just like a true name of the bird to have it come to him, you know and stuff like that.

614
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:32,415
Scott: But notice how when they get to like the end of the world, you know closer to the edge like magic works differently over there You know, it's like.

615
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:41,049
Scott: he's like, you know, he's like yeah and my island all the way over here So far from the center of the world, you know spells that used to work don't work or act strangely.

616
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:44,089
Scott: yet I see other people with different spells that are working.

617
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:51,778
Scott: So it's like they don't fully explain like, you know the science of the magic but it's it's really interesting how it's like.

618
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,085
Scott: maybe dragons over.

619
00:41:54,185 --> 00:41:54,406
Scott: is it?

620
00:41:54,787 --> 00:41:56,515
Scott: is it the dragon?

621
00:41:56,535 --> 00:42:03,164
Scott: the power comes from the dragons and you know Whatever they called things in that part of the world is where the power comes from.

622
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:04,529
Scott: or is it you know?

623
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,639
Scott: The power is somehow our power of belief.

624
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,061
Scott: Yes.

625
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:10,170
Rym: Oh, you know what actually would make a lot of words.

626
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:13,750
Scott: You know if there's enough power in those words where they're met.

627
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:19,370
Scott: They're spoken often here or they are known here that it's like there's a rock over on this side of the world.

628
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,322
Scott: Well, there were never dragons calling it this name over here.

629
00:42:22,382 --> 00:42:24,109
Scott: So it doesn't know that that's its name.

630
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:25,897
Scott: It doesn't have any power over.

631
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:32,969
Rym: it does point out several times in the book that you know They were so far from places that the things out here didn't even know their own name.

632
00:42:33,029 --> 00:42:35,019
Scott: Yeah It's like how does get get his true name?

633
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,124
Scott: Someone tells it to him.

634
00:42:36,144 --> 00:42:37,430
Scott: It's what he's called.

635
00:42:37,952 --> 00:42:39,298
Scott: Someone calls him that right.

636
00:42:39,499 --> 00:42:47,585
Scott: so in the middle of the world where the dragons were right Dragons called the rocks by that name and thus that name has power over those rocks.

637
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:49,931
Rym: But well, you know, it really makes once Mm-hmm.

638
00:42:50,794 --> 00:42:52,098
Rym: I can't spoil the other books.

639
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:54,687
Rym: Well the other books that aren't that you haven't read.

640
00:42:54,707 --> 00:42:58,409
Rym: but Think about how the magic and the prince of nothing works.

641
00:43:00,272 --> 00:43:09,264
Rym: if if you take it to be the exact same system the exact same way magic works on a Fundamental level then it kind of makes perfect sense.

642
00:43:09,746 --> 00:43:11,433
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of similar but it's just.

643
00:43:11,474 --> 00:43:28,028
Scott: it's a really interesting way for you know, the magic to work and Simultaneously get a message across about you know, the importance of names, you know It's not a shallow book Despite being short despite being sure short and deep.

644
00:43:28,893 --> 00:43:31,569
Scott: It's the way I like it nice and easy get a lot out of it.

645
00:43:33,251 --> 00:43:35,719
Scott: I'm trying to think of this anything else awesome going on here.

646
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,535
Rym: pretty much the most awesome part for me was when dragons can lie In that tongue, but humans can't.

647
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:41,498
Scott: yeah, that was pretty cool.

648
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:43,706
Scott: and how he totally how he gets the dragon.

649
00:43:43,726 --> 00:43:47,060
Rym: Yeah By the way, I know your name.

650
00:43:47,482 --> 00:43:49,130
Scott: Yeah, and it's like why did he know his name?

651
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:57,070
Scott: Well, because you know, yes Well, he guessed based on a story he heard and that's it's like all you know, the power of wizards isn't in this book.

652
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,304
Scott: I mean he had they.

653
00:43:58,384 --> 00:44:07,091
Scott: obviously He has some sort of natural affinity to you know magics, right but power in this book really is knowledge Right.

654
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:10,303
Scott: It's like he's a quick learner and that's why he's so powerful.

655
00:44:10,343 --> 00:44:12,210
Scott: It's he learned quicker than everyone else.

656
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,016
Scott: He knows more names of things.

657
00:44:14,077 --> 00:44:16,023
Scott: He's it came easily to him.

658
00:44:16,646 --> 00:44:17,730
Scott: It's not about you know.

659
00:44:18,152 --> 00:44:20,930
Scott: Oh, I have more midi chlorians or the forces drawn.

660
00:44:22,973 --> 00:44:27,230
Scott: It's not about you know, I have magic items or I have more levels.

661
00:44:27,551 --> 00:44:29,137
Scott: It's I know more.

662
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:40,497
Scott: I know more names of things and I am I learn these things easily and that's why I'm the most powerful because I am more knowledgeable and Knowledge is where magic comes from.

663
00:44:40,517 --> 00:44:44,010
Scott: whoever knows more knows more magic, you know, it's not you know.

664
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:49,030
Scott: Can you you know manipulate your hands in such a way or any you know sort of skill like that?

665
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:53,569
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time some people even if they're otherwise bright just don't have the gift.

666
00:44:54,334 --> 00:45:01,830
Scott: Well, yeah, you know that that's you know, the other part of it Yeah, yeah, I don't know they didn't go too deeply into that.

667
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,553
Rym: so Moving on.

668
00:45:04,573 --> 00:45:10,670
Rym: I mean we have to choose the next book and I So we're done with the earth sees you have anything more to say.

669
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:13,887
Scott: I'm kind of I feel like I have something more to say but none to come to mind.

670
00:45:14,229 --> 00:45:16,236
Scott: Yeah Well, I feel like we should conclude though.

671
00:45:16,276 --> 00:45:17,421
Scott: It's a great book.

672
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:22,150
Scott: There's other books in the series should all be read Yeah, but you didn't read any more except the first one.

673
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:22,993
Scott: No, but I will see.

674
00:45:23,013 --> 00:45:28,697
Scott: the thing is the second book actually, you know gets there right at least I. he's there in books Two and three as far as I remember.

675
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:31,310
Scott: I only read these things once way back and someone has my copies.

676
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:36,570
Scott: So, I don't know but I remember like at least in like tombs of Ottawa and he's there but he's not like the main character.

677
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,814
Scott: It's like it's about someone else.

678
00:45:37,854 --> 00:45:42,570
Scott: but like he's there, you know, and then you know, they sort of get into later on.

679
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:46,455
Scott: You know Kings and things like that Which is the way they do.

680
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:48,783
Scott: that is actually completely well the way she does.

681
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:52,801
Scott: that is actually completely different for the way Other books have handled it yet again.

682
00:45:53,304 --> 00:45:57,069
Scott: So it's like double whammies upcoming All right.

683
00:45:57,971 --> 00:46:06,943
Rym: So I actually had a lot of trouble trying to decide what book I want to choose because the deal was that Scott could pick Any book any book in the world and I picked.

684
00:46:07,003 --> 00:46:08,470
Scott: I picked what I gave it to you listeners.

685
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:10,486
Scott: I picked a book that was good for you.

686
00:46:10,546 --> 00:46:10,990
Scott: Not a book.

687
00:46:11,211 --> 00:46:15,047
Scott: Well, it was kind of good for me, but more good for you than Scott Scott.

688
00:46:15,087 --> 00:46:15,689
Rym: Was it good for you?

689
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:17,080
Rym: It was good because it was good for me.

690
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:17,928
Rym: I know real good.

691
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:22,164
Scott: But you know, I picked a book that would satisfy listeners and listeners.

692
00:46:22,204 --> 00:46:23,570
Scott: in mind that I made my selection.

693
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,100
Scott: Really I don't know if it's gonna be so generous.

694
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,550
Scott: he might you know, just be like, yeah, fuck you all Ulysses.

695
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:30,758
Rym: Hey, I don't like that book.

696
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:34,210
Scott: or you might just be like, yeah, fuck you all, you know war and peace.

697
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:35,855
Rym: Hey, I don't like that book either.

698
00:46:36,437 --> 00:46:37,019
Scott: I'm just saying.

699
00:46:37,581 --> 00:46:44,970
Rym: but my trouble is that well Scott Gives one to you in that he picks something that you will clearly enjoy and probably read.

700
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:53,190
Rym: My brand of giving one to you is forcing you to read something that you otherwise wouldn't read but yet is a fantastic work.

701
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:57,290
Scott: However, yeah, you might have a hard time reading because apparently you're all literate.

702
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:03,850
Rym: However, I'm not going to pick the Count of Monte Cristo because wallet is one of my favorite novels ever.

703
00:47:04,173 --> 00:47:09,340
Scott: actually, I just read an interview with Jason and You know the comic guy.

704
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:14,768
Scott: Yep, and he was like Yeah Dumas uses five words when he could use one.

705
00:47:15,652 --> 00:47:19,459
Scott: Cuz he you know why he was paid by the law I know but he you know easy cuz he wrote.

706
00:47:19,479 --> 00:47:23,056
Scott: he did the last musketeer and he's like, yeah I tried to read three musketeer seat.

707
00:47:23,116 --> 00:47:23,980
Scott: I didn't finish it.

708
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:33,449
Rym: I Remember in particular the the Count of Monte Cristo spends like three paragraphs describing the chain mail that he's wearing at one point.

709
00:47:35,093 --> 00:47:36,489
Rym: But so I'm not gonna pick something like that.

710
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:41,390
Rym: So I wanted to pick a book that I haven't read that I'm going to read soon.

711
00:47:41,431 --> 00:47:49,629
Rym: That's in my queue But I looked at my queue and it is 50% fantasy and I want to get away from fantasy because we've been talking a lot about fantasy, you know, prince of nothing.

712
00:47:49,709 --> 00:48:02,018
Rym: this And at the same time all the other books in my queue are nonfiction and I don't think you want to read a history of the Peloponnesian Wars or Contemporary Greek history like Xenophon or Herodotus.

713
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:03,603
Scott: I don't Herodotus.

714
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:05,087
Rym: No, it's Herodotus.

715
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:07,853
Scott: quiet you Captain Agricola.

716
00:48:08,498 --> 00:48:08,740
Scott: I don't know.

717
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,263
Scott: So what are you gonna?

718
00:48:09,283 --> 00:48:10,210
Scott: What are you gonna give the people?

719
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:14,143
Scott: Are you gonna throw the P people something that's like Roman?

720
00:48:14,163 --> 00:48:19,663
Scott: or maybe you're gonna give them like some of your Victor Hugo your French a file is ever gonna do?

721
00:48:19,683 --> 00:48:24,242
Rym: I don't like Victor Hugo Who says I'm even a Francophile?

722
00:48:24,262 --> 00:48:25,389
Scott: Oh, you know it.

723
00:48:28,112 --> 00:48:30,865
Rym: I'm more of a Greco-Roman a file if anything.

724
00:48:30,906 --> 00:48:38,481
Scott: Yeah, you're Europhile But only South or southern Southern Europe or France's north south east and west Europe.

725
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,130
Scott: In fact, it's in the middle except for Germany, which is more in the middle.

726
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:55,909
Rym: So I kind of narrowed it down to I. on one hand I might want to do a Farewell to arms because I really do like Hemingway and while the Sun Also Rises is a better book that meant more to me.

727
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,396
Rym: Everyone's read the Sun Also Rises.

728
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:01,086
Rym: At least I hope everyone's read the Sun Also Rises.

729
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,150
Scott: I've read the Sun All Rises.

730
00:49:02,351 --> 00:49:03,518
Scott: I've read Old Man in the Sea.

731
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:05,832
Scott: I did not read Farewell to Arms But you know what?

732
00:49:05,852 --> 00:49:08,983
Scott: That's one for the listeners because Hemingway is really easy.

733
00:49:09,605 --> 00:49:10,830
Rym: It is it was dark.

734
00:49:11,331 --> 00:49:13,777
Rym: I was drinking coffee.

735
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:15,521
Rym: The window was open.

736
00:49:15,742 --> 00:49:16,925
Rym: It was dark outside.

737
00:49:16,945 --> 00:49:18,689
Scott: It's like reading Cat in the Hat 20 times.

738
00:49:19,231 --> 00:49:20,328
Scott: You just read a Hemingway book.

739
00:49:20,931 --> 00:49:22,777
Rym: No, it's reading the Cat in the Hat.

740
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:27,130
Rym: if the cat was depressed and drank all the time to cover up his horrible.

741
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,114
Scott: That's that's what it's about.

742
00:49:29,295 --> 00:49:32,949
Scott: I mean if you want breaks into the house and molest children, it's it's pretty dark.

743
00:49:34,912 --> 00:49:45,690
Rym: If you want to get a taste of Hemingway without reading a full Hemingway Just read A Clean Well Lid Place because that Encapsulates pretty much everything that Hemingway ever wrote into one concise short story.

744
00:49:46,513 --> 00:49:53,338
Rym: but I don't feel like a lot of people have read Farewell to Arms and of All the books I've read in my life.

745
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:53,679
Scott: Oh god.

746
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:55,064
Scott: Oh god chainsaw juggling.

747
00:49:55,907 --> 00:50:02,727
Rym: Of all the books I have no idea how he died.

748
00:50:06,446 --> 00:50:20,393
Rym: When In Rome that book has perhaps the most cold depressing end I've ever seen because it hits you like a brick and then the book ends with not even so much as a Typical.

749
00:50:20,453 --> 00:50:21,698
Scott: everyone dies at the end.

750
00:50:21,758 --> 00:50:24,108
Rym: No, it's even worse than that the book basically.

751
00:50:24,128 --> 00:50:24,570
Scott: how could it be?

752
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:29,750
Scott: I mean, I've read you know, so many things that you know purposefully depressing endings.

753
00:50:29,953 --> 00:50:32,835
Scott: How could you possibly You know do worse?

754
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:38,110
Rym: because it it hits you in such a horrible cold ham-fisted manner.

755
00:50:38,231 --> 00:50:44,608
Rym: it's like you're reading and then Someone comes out and says something and the main character walks away in the at the end.

756
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,150
Rym: Like that's it.

757
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,977
Rym: It's like BAM done and it.

758
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,679
Rym: it really affected me because I read this book in middle school and it It was really sad.

759
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,930
Rym: It was perhaps the saddest thing I'd ever read up to that point.

760
00:50:57,316 --> 00:50:58,306
Rym: I have a couple copies of it.

761
00:50:58,326 --> 00:50:59,654
Scott: All right good I don't want to buy anything.

762
00:50:59,936 --> 00:51:00,217
Scott: I have a.

763
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,970
Rym: I have a small collection of first editions of books.

764
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,575
Scott: I really like you've decided on for.

765
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:08,026
Rym: maybe not though because I have a first edition of.

766
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,330
Rym: well anyway, skipping all that.

767
00:51:10,075 --> 00:51:26,950
Rym: but the other option which I Partly want to talk about because the book is very relevant to a lot of things going on in society right now And I have more social commentary to say than I do Commentary about the book and it would probably be a two-hour show and Scott and I both just read it recently.

768
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:28,450
Scott: Yeah, that's what this if you pick this one.

769
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:31,730
Scott: This is one for us because we just read it and we don't have to read it again.

770
00:51:31,951 --> 00:51:33,182
Scott: Oh, this one is farewell to arms.

771
00:51:33,202 --> 00:51:33,989
Scott: You have to go and read it.

772
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:38,190
Rym: But if you have to read it, I've read farewell to arms like four times you pick this book.

773
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,896
Scott: We don't have to read shit cuz we just read it.

774
00:51:39,976 --> 00:51:43,710
Rym: Hyperion is like one of the best books I've read.

775
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:50,570
Scott: Yeah, the thing is that's not one for the listeners who are all illiterate because it's long ish.

776
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,081
Scott: It took me a few days to read.

777
00:51:52,101 --> 00:51:55,353
Scott: Oh my god days and It's hard.

778
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:57,680
Scott: Like it's not a baby book.

779
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,806
Scott: Well plus middle school kid wouldn't get it.

780
00:51:59,886 --> 00:52:04,429
Rym: if you're not terribly literate You better know your Keats at least a little.

781
00:52:05,812 --> 00:52:22,647
Scott: if you don't have knowledge of like, you know art history at least a little bit and Keats and Poetry and and you know things you're not gonna get a lot of the book You have to know like you have to know like sci-fi.

782
00:52:22,687 --> 00:52:30,930
Scott: you have to know like detective Canterbury Tales, even though I'm going to say I haven't read the Canterbury Tales.

783
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:38,430
Rym: The Canterbury Tales are not entertaining and are not worth reading except as an exercise in literary frustration.

784
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:42,642
Scott: It's like I hate the everything there is to get from my period.

785
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:45,630
Scott: you have to be a smart and well-read person.

786
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:49,183
Scott: Otherwise it will do nothing for you and you'll just be like what the fuck.

787
00:52:49,284 --> 00:52:55,324
Rym: of course the other problem is You would all hate us because you get to the end of Hyperion and you look up.

788
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:56,950
Scott: You got to read Fall of Hyperion.

789
00:52:57,192 --> 00:52:58,043
Scott: Yes, you got nothing.

790
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:01,177
Rym: But not only that all the social commentary.

791
00:53:01,237 --> 00:53:14,060
Rym: I have all the relevant discussion about what we are doing to ourselves as a society now And the fact that reading Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion has changed in a few Not in substantial ways my political views.

792
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,030
Scott: the thing is there's also in Demian and rise of in Demian.

793
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:18,814
Scott: I didn't read.

794
00:53:18,914 --> 00:53:20,179
Scott: I know I sort of they give.

795
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:25,450
Scott: they tell you at the end of Fall of Hyperion Like what is gonna happen in in Demian?

796
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,860
Scott: But then I look at those two in Demian books and they're real big.

797
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,290
Scott: so I wonder like what the fuck is in those.

798
00:53:32,193 --> 00:53:34,450
Rym: But at the same time I don't feel like it matters.

799
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:34,972
Scott: It does.

800
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:41,940
Scott: it doesn't matter that much because there's really only one thing that is left a mystery and it's not a mystery that you Really need to know yeah

801
00:53:42,142 --> 00:53:44,313
Rym: as opposed to Hyperion Which doesn't leaves

802
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:47,421
Scott: every mystery that explains them all in Fall of Hyperion except

803
00:53:47,501 --> 00:53:47,822
Rym: for

804
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:48,143
Scott: one

805
00:53:48,263 --> 00:53:50,710
Rym: is it is such an incredibly satisfying book.

806
00:53:51,032 --> 00:53:52,141
Scott: It's real satisfying.

807
00:53:52,786 --> 00:53:53,752
Rym: and yeah I have a couple.

808
00:53:53,973 --> 00:54:00,577
Rym: the other option the third option that I get a third option that I really really want to do Because I don't feel like enough.

809
00:54:00,597 --> 00:54:03,850
Rym: people have read it and I have some interesting takes on it.

810
00:54:04,191 --> 00:54:09,150
Rym: I've read this a couple times in my life not contiguously, but the Odyssey.

811
00:54:10,252 --> 00:54:15,243
Scott: Okay Homer's I've read parts of the Odyssey a few times.

812
00:54:15,303 --> 00:54:17,410
Scott: I've never read the whole thing like all at once.

813
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:26,350
Rym: I'll admit I'm kind of ashamed to admit that I've never actually read the Iliad or Several other of these ancient of these great words need or whatever.

814
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:35,509
Rym: but I but I've read the Odyssey several times partly because I really dig Athena and I Don't like Odysseus that much, you know, my man is.

815
00:54:36,537 --> 00:54:42,519
Rym: Your man is probably precise Besides an ass and I'll say Fucking man.

816
00:54:42,922 --> 00:54:49,121
Rym: No one beats Poseidon cuz Athena beats Poseidon every time because wall Poseidon is strong.

817
00:54:49,362 --> 00:54:50,205
Rym: He's stupid.

818
00:54:50,486 --> 00:54:51,870
Rym: He's a stupid motherfucker.

819
00:54:52,134 --> 00:54:53,049
Scott: Yeah, but you know what?

820
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,101
Scott: Everyone's afraid of him because you know what.

821
00:54:55,121 --> 00:55:00,130
Scott: you can't get anywhere without a boat Can't get anywhere without a boat and every time everyone gets in a boat.

822
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:04,367
Scott: They're like, please Poseidon don't throw don't tip me over and drown me, please.

823
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:07,236
Scott: Oh my god Sometimes he goes.

824
00:55:07,256 --> 00:55:14,710
Scott: I will let you go and so and but I will actually even though I'll let you go and live I will Steer you to a horrible island with a monster.

825
00:55:15,332 --> 00:55:17,139
Scott: But other times Poseidon goes, you know what?

826
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,865
Scott: I'm just gonna fuck you you drown.

827
00:55:18,905 --> 00:55:19,206
Rym: Haha.

828
00:55:19,407 --> 00:55:23,669
Rym: See unlike you I will not prostrate myself before gods.

829
00:55:24,272 --> 00:55:25,596
Scott: Yeah, so what besides?

830
00:55:25,636 --> 00:55:26,820
Scott: just gonna tip your ass over?

831
00:55:26,841 --> 00:55:28,346
Scott: Yeah, you know Poseidon.

832
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,530
Scott: I'm so smart and you're so stupid.

833
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:30,909
Scott: It'll be like yeah, but you're so dead.

834
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:37,489
Rym: But at the same time all I have to do is be Odysseus like enough to where Athena will totally have my back.

835
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:40,922
Scott: Totally stupid.

836
00:55:43,044 --> 00:55:50,010
Scott: See How to beat Poseidon's and his stupid his stupidity, but anger be just as stupid.

837
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,678
Rym: See the thing is Odysseus isn't stupid.

838
00:55:51,698 --> 00:55:52,462
Scott: He's not that stupid.

839
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,210
Rym: He's clever really clever.

840
00:55:54,572 --> 00:55:57,407
Rym: It's just reading the Odyssey the most recent time.

841
00:55:57,468 --> 00:56:00,698
Rym: I read it I got a different perception from the other couple times.

842
00:56:00,738 --> 00:56:14,208
Rym: I'd read it and instead of seeing him as this clever amazing, man I kind of saw him as this Brute who just kept making things worse and then when things got bad enough He'd do something miraculous to get himself out of it and then make it lucky.

843
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:18,630
Rym: Lucky lucky lucky, but everything he does is of his own scale.

844
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:19,093
Rym: It's just.

845
00:56:19,475 --> 00:56:27,249
Rym: he could have avoided all that in the first place by not Continuing to yell insults back at the island after he escaped for one good job.

846
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:32,510
Rym: So should I do farewell to arms or the Odyssey or?

847
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:33,873
Rym: Hyperion?

848
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:34,737
Scott: you have to pick.

849
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:35,641
Scott: it's up to you.

850
00:56:35,662 --> 00:56:37,270
Scott: You know, it's not a don't put it out for a vote.

851
00:56:40,892 --> 00:56:42,135
Rym: You know what I'm doing.

852
00:56:42,176 --> 00:56:43,198
Rym: a farewell to arms.

853
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,645
Rym: that is my book Ernest Hemingway's.

854
00:56:45,765 --> 00:56:47,429
Rym: a farewell to arms.

855
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:49,435
Scott: I recommend it.

856
00:56:49,596 --> 00:56:50,482
Scott: hello to legs.

857
00:56:50,905 --> 00:57:05,838
Rym: if you've never If you've never read Hemingway before I really would recommend reading III believe it's called a clean well-lit place, but I might be mistaken and then from there read farewell to arms and Yeah, that's my book.

858
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:06,681
Rym: I think it's good.

859
00:57:06,741 --> 00:57:11,724
Rym: also for those of you who are worried that it'll be boring It's kind of an action story.

860
00:57:11,764 --> 00:57:16,300
Rym: There are several Surprising moments of harrowing heroic action.

861
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,470
Scott: I should pick old man in the sea just to continue making it even easier.

862
00:57:23,614 --> 00:57:24,461
Rym: So we're gonna end on what.

863
00:57:24,603 --> 00:57:26,711
Rym: where's Waldo Now?

864
00:57:26,731 --> 00:57:26,992
Scott: where's?

865
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:30,602
Scott: although I spy with my little eye something red.

866
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:31,845
Scott: Oh, there it is.

867
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:36,239
Scott: You say it here Did you spy the button on page five?

868
00:57:36,259 --> 00:57:37,403
Scott: Oh, no.

869
00:57:37,443 --> 00:57:38,968
Scott: Did you see the paper clip on page six?

870
00:57:39,068 --> 00:57:39,390
