3
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:25,713

Scott: I don't know the strong offense, but the other team.

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,820
Scott: they won their last five games, and they've been rested up for last week.

8
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:40,615
Rym: It's gonna be Kimi Raikkonen.

9
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:45,332
Scott: Yeah All right the point of this episode is two things.

00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:01,460
Rym: that might be interesting.

14
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:05,459
Scott: Yeah, kind of like a you know pre-con report like oh this panel looks good.

15
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,385
Scott: You might want to go to that.

16
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:08,015
Scott: you might want to stay away from this.

17
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:08,840
Scott: it looks scary.

18
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:10,546
Scott: You know here's a good idea.

19
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:11,410
Scott: you might want to.

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,782

00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,136
Rym: this will kick off our Otakon coverage.

25
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:22,478
Scott: yep.

26
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:25,450
Rym: So first off with the goods.

27
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:40,987
Rym: in case you're listening to this just before you go to the con Or you're trying to find us the places we can guarantee Garing fucking tea that you will be able to find us at this con on Friday the first day of the con at 11 a.m..

28
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,976
Scott: We are going to have an GeekNights' listener meetup thing kind of.

29
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:56,170
Scott: it's not official It's not on the con schedule, but if you go to the Baltimore Convention Center, and you go upstairs You know there's a place with the escalators.

30
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:56,974
Scott: You know the.

31
00:01:57,155 --> 00:01:59,826
Scott: it's not the Pratt Street Lobby It's the other one right the Otter bean.

32
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,214
Scott: no I forget which Lobby the name is.

33
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:05,180
Scott: if I had a BCC map I could tell you the name of the Lobby.

34
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:08,860
Scott: It's the lobby with the water and the escalators the cosplay Lobby.

35
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:26,114
Scott: Exactly you go up the escalators, and you turn right you go right, and you'll see this like BCC kind of directory kind of thing and there'll be a slight open area in front of some panel rooms And then there'll be some doors that go out to a patio on that patio.

36
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:29,046
Scott: We're gonna hang out at 11 a.m Yes, you will.

37
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,600
Rym: it will not be difficult to find us.

38
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,599
Rym: We may or may not have some small matter of equipment set up recording or something yep.

39
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:44,239
Scott: So at 11 a.m.. On Friday if you want to find us right away Especially if you should find us right away because you're gonna hang out with us a lot, then that's the place to go.

40
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:49,995
Rym: Yep, the only other place we will guarantee that we will show up is the concert on Friday at 8 p.m..

41
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:55,819
Scott: In the Concert arena the power plant the Rams head place at the power plant.

42
00:02:55,839 --> 00:03:03,020
Rym: yeah Yeah, the thing is if you want to meet us at that concert It's going to be nuts and you probably won't find us unless you found us ahead of time.

43
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:05,171
Scott: Yeah, there's going to the way.

44
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:15,002
Scott: the concerts working at Otakon this year Which is different from every place before is that there's actually a concert hall place near Otakon at the power plant Rams head whatever.

45
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:20,813
Scott: it's like a normal small concert joint where bands play and They've rented it out.

46
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:26,582
Scott: I guess Friday night and Saturday afternoon for the same concert But twice.

47
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:38,079
Scott: so the concert is not a katah day and muck which we've talked about in the past, so We're going to go to it on Friday because on Saturday it conflicts with something else that we have to do.

48
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:49,422
Rym: Yes now moving on to Saturday You can definitely without question find us at the anime club summit at 3 p.m.. In panel number 3.

49
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:59,000
Scott: Yes, Rym and Scott Johnson who is not me they run the anime club summit And it's an hour-long panel from 3 to 5 and I not to our long pen.

50
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,706
Rym: Yeah, it's we think.

51
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:03,812
Rym: well the panels been getting really popular so they made it bigger and they put it in a bigger room this year.

52
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:09,440
Rym: hmm and We have you know we have some industry on the panel in addition to us, and it's always a good panel.

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,120
Rym: I mean we really do know what we're talking about when it comes to running anime clubs.

54
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,474
Scott: Yeah, they gave you two hours.

55
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:14,979
Scott: It's pretty good.

56
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:23,230
Rym: Yeah Usually you get one hour because a lot of the higher-ups Otakon really liked the panel and the industry really likes the panel and the Always gets a lot of people.

57
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,152
Scott: mm-hmm see we are guaranteed to be at the anime club summit and a good place.

58
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:38,954
Scott: if you just want to see us and you don't care about the Anime club summit if you go outside of panel 3 at around 5 when it the panel gets out We'll be there, and there's a decent chance at that point.

59
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,080
Rym: We'll all go out and get some food.

60
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,340
Scott: There is a decent chance.

61
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,745
Scott: That's usually the strategy.

62
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:47,079
Scott: now if you look at your Otakon schedule you will note that at 10 a.m.

63
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,967
Scott: On Saturday in theater 1 which is I guess used to be main events There is a. it's called.

64
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,594
Scott: There's a panel called podcasting the right stuff.

65
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,684
Scott: that is not GeekNights That isn't.

66
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:05,991
Rym: I'm not going to say what my opinions of the right stuff podcast But suffice to say that is not our panel.

67
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:09,296
Rym: we may or may not be there to talk to them But don't count on it.

68
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:27,900
Scott: Yeah, the right stuff international is a company that you know distributes and sells anime in the United States And they have an official company podcast and they must have unbeknownst to us until now Asked Otakon for a panel for that podcast and they have it and that has nothing to do with us.

69
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,323
Scott: They're probably not even going to talk about podcasting in general I would guess.

70
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:34,074
Scott: I would guess they're mostly going to talk about their podcast.

71
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:54,414
Scott: you know for the right stuff at least That's the title of their panel implies Our panel is on Sunday at 10 a.m.. In panel 4 if you come Sunday 10 a.m.. Panel room number 4 GeekNights has an hour-long panel called podcasting internet radio.

72
00:05:55,237 --> 00:06:00,552
Rym: We are going to be talking about Podcasting and internet radio and GeekNights.

73
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:01,214
Rym: Yes.

74
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:02,740
Rym: It'll probably be a very good panel.

75
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,071
Rym: We did a similar thing at torque on.

76
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:04,877
Rym: it went over very well.

77
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:16,618
Rym: I expect it will be hilarious and awesome And I expect there will be much hijinks as we take everyone from the panel directly afterward to the con feedback session And then the closing ceremonies in one big blob.

78
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:16,859
Rym: yeah.

79
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:26,969
Scott: So if you come and see us at no other point in the convention come to our panel on Sunday at 10 a.m.. In panel room number 4.

80
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:34,638
Rym: not only is that the absolute guaranteed place to find us unless we get killed or Something ahead of time, but since we'll be recording the panel most likely live.

81
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:38,569
Rym: That's your chance to appear on GeekNights and ask us a question.

82
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:47,592
Scott: possibly yes that episode where of the recording of that panel Will likely air not next Monday, but a week from next Monday.

83
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:50,559
Rym: yep now aside from all those places you can see us.

84
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:54,775
Rym: The things I'm excited about this year other than the usual stuff.

85
00:06:55,176 --> 00:06:56,200
Rym: I mean I want to go to the dances.

86
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:58,213
Rym: I didn't get a chance to dance so much last year.

87
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:11,620
Rym: mm-hmm The FMA movie is being shown and while I've heard a lot of bad things about the movie if I can watch it in the Theater at Otakon for free yeah, it looks like it starts though as soon as the Friday night concert gets out.

88
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,768
Scott: That's it.

89
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:13,499
Scott: we're probably not gonna.

90
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:14,826
Rym: I kind of want to see.

91
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:16,573
Rym: remember we don't have descriptions of these panels.

92
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:19,003
Rym: the only things we have to go on right now are Their names.

93
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:23,000
Rym: yep that said I'm interested in your favorite anime sucks.

94
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:24,716
Scott: Hey, that sounds like a funny panel.

95
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:26,304
Rym: Science and anime.

96
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:34,320
Rym: only because we think it's possible that Mike Pfeffer might be running it just cuz it sounds like the kind of Well because last year he ran anime at politics in anime.

97
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:44,071
Scott: So if he if it's science and anime or anime and philosophy Which is another panel that is running at the same time as the concert now of course chance He might be running it.

98
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:44,720
Rym: every year.

99
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,960
Rym: We go to the con feedback session and closing ceremonies because they are without exception awesome.

100
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:56,840
Rym: Mm-hmm the opening ceremonies you can skip but closing ceremonies and con feedback are great because one Otakon is very well run.

101
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:02,879
Rym: But to the con feedback session is usually at most cons where people come and complain about the things that weren't run.

102
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,531
Rym: well The way Otakon runs it is so awesome and that one.

103
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:09,437
Rym: well I keep saying giving numbers to these things.

104
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:10,119
Rym: I'm gonna stop that.

105
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:22,587
Rym: when people have a complaint the Otakon staff always have had either a direct answer as in that happened because of X and it was out of the control out of our control because of why or That's a great idea.

106
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,759
Rym: talk to us, and we'll do it your way next year.

107
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:28,351
Scott: So basically no one comes up and puns them with questions.

108
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:31,080
Scott: They basically put anyone who comes up with negative.

109
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:39,071
Rym: I mean I remember one year some guy I think he was from cosplay.com came up And he was complaining about the way and Otakon runs their cosplay the masquerade.

110
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:48,251
Rym: they don't follow cosplay.com's rules some arbitrary non-binding organization and the staffers basically said This is our con and we run it the way.

111
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:55,420
Rym: the people who come to our con want it And we don't really care how other people say we should run our masquerade because everyone seems to really enjoy it.

112
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,567
Scott: Yeah I mean I didn't have a problem with it.

113
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,354
Scott: only crazy cosplay people had a problem.

114
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,639
Rym: not even crazy cosplay people.

115
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:04,759
Rym: crazy Cosplay people on cosplay.com who like to complain about things.

116
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,956
Scott: yep Another time, but the year that they had the the Larkin CL concert.

117
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:10,839
Scott: I don't know TMR.

118
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,672
Scott: Oh, I'm sorry the TMR can add TM revolution.

119
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,099
Scott: was it really yes?

120
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,548
Scott: Oh, I think no it had to be both.

121
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:23,530
Rym: No you could you it was specifically that one because the chairs It was the chairs both time.

122
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,000
Rym: no because the chairs in the arena can't be removed Scott.

123
00:09:27,722 --> 00:09:32,300
Scott: No the chairs in the arena were the chairs that we were on in the arena could be removed.

124
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,330
Rym: It was the chair yeah, but most of them couldn't.

125
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,420
Rym: and besides you asked the question during the TMR concert.

126
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,716
Rym: I'm 100% sure that that is what that is.

127
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:40,123
Rym: when this happened I don't know.

128
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:44,559
Rym: I am sure because they were two separate years, and you wouldn't ask the same question two years in a row.

129
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:47,193
Scott: But I don't think we went to the.

130
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:48,079
Rym: yes we did.

131
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,265
Scott: Anyway, I went to the.

132
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:58,840
Rym: in fact you asked about it specifically because people behind us at the TMR concert Yelled at us because we were standing up during the concert.

133
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,410
Scott: Anyway at one of the two concerts.

134
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:08,993
Scott: I had the closing feedback session I asked how come there wasn't any you know general admission standing area.

135
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:21,850
Scott: How come there are chairs from the front to the back and The guy was like yeah, we couldn't get that for security reasons, and I'm like well You know if you couldn't get it for security reasons Maybe you should just you know get more security or something.

136
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:27,180
Scott: uh and then they're like this big guy stood up And he's like ah I'm the security blah.

137
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:28,890
Scott: And then it was funny.

138
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:29,638
Scott: and then I sat down.

139
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:38,498
Scott: But then the guy who did who you know who was in charge of that for Otakon came over And he was like oh, I wanted general admission so bad, but I couldn't get it.

140
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:41,208
Scott: And I was like it's cool.

141
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:41,930
Scott: It's cool.

142
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,700
Rym: Yeah, I mean Otakon really has their stuff together.

143
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,021
Rym: They.

144
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:47,249
Rym: this is probably the best run convention ever

145
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:47,731
Scott: yep,

146
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:57,777
Rym: and also a really cool thing is the new thing They started doing recently is that they show The winning anime music videos at one of the two which means you don't have to sit at

147
00:10:57,797 --> 00:10:58,640
Scott: the closing ceremony You

148
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,789
Rym: don't have to sit through the anime music video contest.

149
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:08,618
Rym: yeah the anime music video contest if you really like AMVs go to it, but I do and I at other cons I always go to it, but I don't have time to go to it at Otakon.

150
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:12,894
Scott: yeah It's just it takes too long, and it's conflicts with the Friday concert.

151
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:14,560
Rym: it conflicts with everything.

152
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,208
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

153
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:18,118
Scott: it's not the greatest usage of time.

154
00:11:18,138 --> 00:11:21,156
Rym: now There's some things on the schedule that scare me this year.

155
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:33,115
Rym: one There is a 18 plus meaning you have to be 18 And they'll check ID to get into this panel called Let's get social Friday afternoon, and that can't be anything other than hookups.

156
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:36,211
Scott: as far as I can tell I know It has to be the hookup panel.

157
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:37,380
Scott: It's actually a workshop.

158
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:38,579
Scott: So it's a hookup workshop.

159
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:40,145
Rym: I guess it's got to be.

160
00:11:40,286 --> 00:11:47,679
Rym: as far as I can guess it's probably just people who want to get with other people at the Con which seems to be the primary goal of a lot of people who go to Otakon.

161
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,449
Scott: yeah But it's mostly the less than 18s who want to hook up But this is 18 plus only.

162
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:56,935
Rym: so this is people who want to hook up But it's guaranteed that no one they hook up with will be illegal and underage.

163
00:11:57,477 --> 00:11:58,380
Scott: Oh, I guess that's okay.

164
00:11:58,622 --> 00:12:03,014
Rym: I think that's great, but maybe we should go to it And I want to go to it just to interview some people about it.

165
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:10,580
Rym: Yeah One the 4chan panel is not 18 plus, but the panel both before it and after it are.

166
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:25,280
Scott: Yeah, I think the general gist is that the 4chan people agreed to follow some certain guidelines To prevent their panel from being 18 plus, but they put it late at night So the likelihood of under 18s going to it is kind of low.

167
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:33,472
Rym: I'm pretty sure that Otakon has a hammer hanging over the 4chan panel And if anything happens this year, they are never coming back.

168
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,797
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure

169
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:49,229
Rym: because last year They staged a fight between a guy who pretended to be a furry and a guy who pretended to be like a 4chan thug And they staged a fake Fight at the panel that almost got the police involved before they admitted that it was fake Mmm, and Otakon was like.

170
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,898
Rym: you can't pull that shit here.

171
00:12:52,462 --> 00:12:57,223
Rym: Now right before it is the hentai doujinshi panel Which no Great.

172
00:12:57,464 --> 00:13:03,687
Rym: right after it is a panel that if I'm not completely dead how to survive the zombie apocalypse Which is probably going to be hilarious

173
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:15,610
Scott: and at the same time as the 4chan panel In fact so long that it starts before and ends after the 4chan panel is a workshop 18 plus do-it-yourself bukkake this.

174
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,894
Rym: this scares the living hell out of me.

175
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:26,291
Rym: if you don't know what bukkake is good first What I want you to do is go to Google Images and turn off safe search then type the word bukkake B-U-K-K-A-K-E.

176
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:28,163
Rym: Into it.

177
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:31,734
Scott: hit enter, but then don't do this if you're under 18.

178
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:32,698
Rym: no no do this.

179
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:33,400
Rym: do this right now.

180
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,667
Scott: If you're under 18 don't do it.

181
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,095
Rym: Oh, yeah, cuz I we don't get in trouble now.

182
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:42,440
Rym: before you click enter Find everyone in your family if you're at work find every find your boss, and then it enter.

183
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:44,944
Rym: Don't actually do that.

184
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:47,250
Rym: No bukkake is a horrible thing.

185
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,800
Scott: So this is a frightening panel immensely frightening.

186
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:58,087
Rym: I am going to this because I want to see what kind of freaks go in and then I want to interview them and ask Them what the hell they're thinking.

187
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:01,120
Scott: yeah, I think that's about pretty much the only scary stuff.

188
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:08,533
Rym: Well the only other thing is that there is a yuri panel that not only does it not say 18 plus But it specifically says not 18 plus.

189
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:10,864
Scott: Maybe they.

190
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:11,888
Scott: you know they.

191
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,055
Scott: they fought hard to get it to be not you know.

192
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:17,160
Scott: what I wonder is that Shouldn't they just call to the shoujo eye pan?

193
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,660
Rym: That's what I was about to say because yuri is a much more specific word than a lot of American fans seem to think.

194
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,790
Rym: just Like yaoi yaoi doesn't mean boys liking each other.

195
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,938
Rym: yaoi means boys doing things to each other.

196
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,406
Scott: yeah Yeah, all right now.

197
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:46,200
Scott: as for our traditional incredibly violent late-night live-action movie You will note that video room 5 at Otakon is showing only live-action Asian cinema Which is awesome and a lot of the movies in there are awesome and a lot of the movies in there are.

198
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:49,835
Rym: Yeah, there's a half-hour movie.

199
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,473
Rym: That's just called South Asian horror.

200
00:14:52,917 --> 00:15:04,140
Scott: yep well I looked in at the what movies are playing late at night Friday and Saturday to figure out which one was ridiculously violent And I've checked out four of them that are look like good contenders.

201
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:13,100
Scott: IMDb and I have short summaries lady Terminator is at like 1030 in video 5. of course on Friday.

202
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:22,563
Scott: the only thing I have to say about this is She mates, and then she terminates After.

203
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:32,840
Scott: that is art of the devil 2 which is supposedly a movie That's kind of slow for 40 minutes But then after 40 minutes because it's no it's an hour and a half 90 minute movie.

204
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:35,360
Scott: So the second 50 minutes are ultra-violent.

205
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,130
Rym: Yep, so maybe we'll go.

206
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,740
Rym: we haven't decided which one we're going to yet.

207
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,878
Scott: Yeah, we are to the devil - looks like a good contender because it feels like one of those horrible horrible movies.

208
00:15:45,918 --> 00:16:08,479
Scott: It's not good Saturday night at 9 they're showing G goku which is there are like three movies and IMDb named G goku and G goku I'm pretty sure means hell in Japanese and They are all had to do with Japanese hell, so I'm not sure if it's gonna be ultra-violent if it's gonna be about you know learning a lesson or anything like that.

209
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,306
Rym: of course the One after it is called sex and fury.

210
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:16,940
Scott: yeah now sex and fury was described on IMDb as being a specific genre of pink violence.

211
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:24,900
Scott: Basically the movie is full of not ultra-violence, but just kind of normal over-the-top violence with lots of TNA.

212
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:27,327
Scott: So that's also a pretty good contender.

213
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:34,899
Scott: You know because you got the TNA combined with the better than American cinema violence It could be good that could be the one.

214
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:37,980
Rym: Yeah, we'll basically make the decision at the con.

215
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:44,685
Rym: So you'll have had to track us down at some point to figure out what the ultra-violent movie is that we are all going to Go to and yell about.

216
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:52,420
Scott: and of course you know if at any time There's a good chance that we randomly hang around video 5 when the con is at a low point.

217
00:16:52,701 --> 00:17:00,032
Rym: Yes, also if you don't go to the concert on Friday You must must go to video 4 at 7 30 p.m.

218
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,714
Rym: And watch Lupin the third strange psychokinetic strategy.

219
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,140
Scott: That's a live-action.

220
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:08,472
Scott: Lupin the third movie.

221
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:09,319
Scott: that's awesome.

222
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:21,460
Rym: It is badass And I even missed the first 15 minutes of it because I was asleep in the hotel room a little hungover and Scott Johnson Comes back from the movie wakes me up and forces me to get dressed to come down and watch it.

223
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,780
Scott: I think it might be available on DVD though.

224
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,223
Scott: I think that's why it's being shown at all these cons that someone's selling it and if I see in the dealers room I'm gonna get it.

225
00:17:28,304 --> 00:17:29,431
Rym: if the movie hadn't been good.

226
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:31,100
Rym: I would have killed him, but the movie was awesome.

227
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:39,820
Scott: Yeah, also at 2 o'clock and video 4 on Friday They're showing perfect your earth defense force, which is supposedly hilarious.

228
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,546
Scott: Anime world order bets their lives on it.

229
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,455
Scott: Yeah, we'll say and if I don't buy in the dealers room.

230
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:46,439
Scott: I'm gonna go watch it there.

231
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:50,150
Scott: All right, what else looks really interesting at this con?

232
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:50,611
Rym: I don't know.

233
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,820
Rym: everything else is pretty standard con fair.

234
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:54,320
Rym: I really need to read the descriptions.

235
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,400
Rym: I mean video 7 is gonna have a bunch of premieres Saturday from all the companies.

236
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,589
Scott: But yeah, there's a Voltron special in video 7 from media blasters.

237
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,794
Scott: Who's putting out all those Voltron DVDs.

238
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:12,200
Rym: at 9 o'clock on Saturday They're showing Cromartie the movie Which I missed at several other cons.

239
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:17,620
Rym: Maybe we'll have to go see that but overlapping that is animal treasure island and the transform.

240
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:18,342
Scott: Oh, I got.

241
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:20,028
Scott: I really want to see animal treasure island.

242
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:23,540
Rym: That's a classic old-school anime panel and the masquerade.

243
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:26,954
Scott: Yeah, I think mother animal treasure island might win.

244
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:29,222
Scott: That's an old-school Tezuka thing.

245
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:33,031
Rym: Yeah, but if you need a census to the scale of Otakon consider this.

246
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:38,179
Rym: most cons would never put major events Conflicting with each other at all.

247
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:49,480
Rym: Like to have the ANV contest at the same time as a concert would be crazy because everyone goes to every big event Otakon so big that they have to do it that way because there's so many people.

248
00:18:49,560 --> 00:19:00,234
Scott: yeah, imagine if you have like a your main the main events room at your convention is as holds 5,000 people and so at your Cosplay everyone shows up and you have an ANV contest.

249
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:01,559
Scott: That's where most people are gonna be.

250
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:10,419
Scott: so if you put them both at the same time You're gonna force people to choose between one and the other and you're basically gonna split your con in half And a lot of people are gonna be angry.

251
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,836
Rym: There is no room at Otakon that can hold all of Otakon.

252
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:18,060
Scott: well except for the arena Yeah, but even that which is why they got the arena for the cosplay.

253
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,176
Rym: Yes, if everyone wants to go to the cosplay they can arrange it.

254
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:21,498
Rym: Mm-hmm.

255
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:25,780
Scott: But other than that, there is nothing at Otakon that can accommodate everyone.

256
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:31,460
Scott: So they put as many awesome things simultaneous to each other to keep the people spread out.

257
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:35,874
Scott: You know fill up everything as opposed to having one overflowing bucket.

258
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,580
Scott: They have you know, so much water.

259
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:38,678
Scott: They get a lot of small buckets.

260
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:42,412
Rym: Yeah, Otakon does provide a lot of water which is very key.

261
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:43,134
Scott: Lots of what.

262
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:44,620
Scott: there's free water everywhere.

263
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:51,840
Scott: Make sure you take advantage of it or else you will dehydrate because you're being air-conditioned in the convention center and it's hot as hell outside.

264
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:53,465
Scott: You don't realize.

265
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:55,011
Scott: you're dehydrating in the air conditioning.

266
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:55,995
Scott: drink water a lot.

267
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:57,020
Scott: you're doing a lot of walking.

268
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:58,884
Rym: Yes Also, don't forget to eat.

269
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:00,149
Rym: eat a lot of food.

270
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:03,460
Rym: eat more food than you think you need because you go to eat.

271
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:06,285
Scott: You should become full After you eat.

272
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,497
Scott: every single time you eat lunch and dinner.

273
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,800
Rym: now We'll have a lot to say about the food because this year the food situation might be a little different.

274
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,253
Rym: But if you have at all any problems with food at the con.

275
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,940
Rym: go across the street to the mall.

276
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:21,419
Rym: They have amazing food and they give discounts to Otakon people they know.

277
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,527
Scott: Yeah remember when I talked about those escalators.

278
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:34,793
Scott: if you go up those escalators in the the water and The fountain room the big giant lobby the cosplay lobby Yeah, you turn left and you go out the con out those doors and keep going.

279
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,100
Scott: You'll eventually go across the sky walk.

280
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:43,272
Scott: You'll see everyone's going this way to a mall and a food court and that is the best place to get Normal kind of food.

281
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:46,389
Rym: be warned There is nowhere to sit there.

282
00:20:46,469 --> 00:20:56,919
Rym: that place will be as crowded as Otakon for the entire Convention and there'll be a lot of normal people who are just in the inner harbor for the weekend Just not knowing what to do and freaking out.

283
00:20:57,271 --> 00:21:02,474
Scott: Yeah If you don't show up there to eat at strange times, like if you don't want to eat at like 10 a.m.

284
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:10,054
Scott: And 3 p.m You're not gonna find a seat there and let without you a fight Especially if you bring a large crew with you.

285
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:14,617
Scott: if you go alone You'll probably might find a chair somewhere if you bring your friends.

286
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:15,019
Scott: give up.

287
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:18,500
Rym: Yeah, basically don't expect to eat lunch with the front row crew.

288
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:21,860
Rym: In fact, the front row crew does not eat lunch with the front row crew.

289
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:27,160
Rym: We go in groups of one to three at random times all day for breakfast and lunches.

290
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:31,738
Scott: Yeah, sometimes we just grab our breakfast before the con starts in a small breakfast nook.

291
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:34,027
Rym: Yep However, generally Saturday night.

292
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:38,183
Rym: at some point though, maybe this year because of all the stuff going on Saturday We'll do it Friday night.

293
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:42,717
Rym: We get the everyone involved and associated with us.

294
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:46,570
Rym: last year We had like 19 or 20 or maybe I'm more than that.

295
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:46,790
Rym: Mm-hmm.

296
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:49,640
Rym: Go to fud Rucker's in a giant blob.

297
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:56,660
Scott: Yes, if you walk down the road towards the ESPN Whatever it is, you know the power plant concert place is down that way.

298
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,408
Scott: Also, you will see a fud Rucker's eat there.

299
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,236
Scott: eat there at least once during the convention sometime.

300
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,444
Rym: don't order a milkshake Why not?

301
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:06,255
Rym: they will not be able to accommodate you.

302
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:10,819
Rym: that place Cannot accommodate the number of people from Otakon to try to eat at it.

303
00:22:11,222 --> 00:22:13,120
Scott: Well, if it's not crowded when you go you can get a milkshake.

304
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,626
Scott: It just takes a long time for them to make them.

305
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:18,500
Scott: Yeah, unless they forget your milkshake and also they have a one-pound hamburger, right?

306
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,145
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

307
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:20,707
Rym: Yeah.

308
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:23,440
Scott: Oh don't eat that unless your stomach's real big now.

309
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,960
Rym: The other thing we usually do is we go to a fancy restaurant one of the other days.

310
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,239
Scott: Don't come to us at the fancy restaurant if you don't know us.

311
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:34,567
Rym: Yeah, but well if you try to follow us to the fancy restaurant You'll know if we're going to the fancy restaurant one.

312
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:38,280
Rym: You probably won't have enough money because even our friends don't have enough money.

313
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,166
Rym: We barely squeak by every year.

314
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:44,140
Rym: Yeah, and two that is like the front row crew like private dinner.

315
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:46,128
Scott: Yeah, you don't you don't get to come.

316
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:47,454
Rym: Yeah, unless we invite you.

317
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:48,980
Scott: Yeah, if you're invited you can come.

318
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:55,239
Rym: I mean last year we had a good 18 or 19 people just at that one and we took up like the entire.

319
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:06,035
Rym: we took up an entire giant table to the point that Like we were separated at this one table into like eight groups that were each Individually talking in a small conversation unrelated to everyone else.

320
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:07,140
Rym: It was that many people.

321
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,060
Scott: Yeah, usually, you know you go to eat somewhere and the whole table is one conversation or two conversations.

322
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,708
Scott: this one was like six or seven conversations.

323
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:19,411
Rym: Yeah, like I was sitting on the end talking to Ido and Brian and Completely independent of that there were other conversations going on.

324
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:22,923
Scott: Yeah, it's crazy big table Let's see.

325
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:24,833
Scott: I'm sure there was something else on here.

326
00:23:24,893 --> 00:23:26,159
Scott: That was interesting and I missed it.

327
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:35,359
Rym: Yeah, I guess the thing is I I highlighted events I'm interested in going to and I have highlighted something at every single point in the entire convention.

328
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:44,240
Rym: and This does not even include The video game room the dealers room the artist alley the art show everything else we're doing at the con.

329
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:49,800
Scott: You're probably not gonna see us in the video game room more than maybe once just so we can look at the video game room.

330
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:53,700
Scott: Yeah, generally what we tend to do at Otakon is look at the video game room once and then leave it.

331
00:23:53,841 --> 00:24:00,653
Rym: I mean, I like to play DDR at cons But we're going to Wildwood to play on the brand new ninth mix machines that you

332
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:01,797
Scott: are supernova that

333
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:03,986
Rym: just came from Japan Recently, so it's

334
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:10,820
Scott: like I can play video games any time While I'm at Otakon, I have to do things that you know are awesome to Otakon.

335
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:20,589
Scott: So I'm not gonna spend my time playing video games or I would enter tournaments if they were interesting tournaments and not the same typical Halo Smash Brothers tournaments that you see everywhere

336
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:25,740
Rym: and also I guess one kind of final kind of warning to all of our fans Hang out with us at the con.

337
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:35,129
Rym: I definitely we want to hang out with you But if we all head back to our hotel room to plan something unless we specifically invite you to come We've had situations in the past with people.

338
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,919
Rym: We don't really know just trying to follow us back to the hotel room.

339
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:46,740
Rym: Yeah, but if we if you're invited to the hotel room You'll know it because we'll specifically invite you probably because we want to interview you or do something.

340
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:53,460
Scott: If no one says to you, hey you come with us then don't come with us to places.

341
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,424
Scott: But any place

342
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:55,829
Rym: any place outside of the con

343
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:01,699
Scott: exactly if we're at the convention, you can do whatever the hell you want Yeah, unless I say because then if you annoy me, I'll say go away

344
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:09,460
Rym: Yeah, and also you can try to hang out with us at lunch But we're not going to save you a seat because we don't even save each other seats.

345
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:12,956
Rym: It is definitely a fight to the death over food indeed indeed.

346
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:20,500
Rym: So this is the last normal episode of GeekNights until we get back from Wildwood and Otakon and everything.

347
00:25:21,283 --> 00:25:22,969
Scott: So after next week we will return.

Rym: of course there will still be episodes every day next week But there will be specials and such.

349
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:27,609
Rym: Mm-hmm.

350
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:28,995
Rym: So think about that work ethic.

351
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:31,565
Rym: even when we're on vacation There are still podcasts going up.

352
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:32,749
Scott: fear that.
