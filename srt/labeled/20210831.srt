1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,251
Rym: It's Tuesday August 31st 2021.

2
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:15,079
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:19,659
Rym: tonight We're talking about death matches usually associated with boomer shooters.

4
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,197
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:28,360
Rym: So yeah this past weekend Went on another long bike ride.

6
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,600
Rym: So for the second time I have biked all the way to Poughkeepsie from New York and took a Metro North home.

7
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:36,864
Rym: that's a real fun ride, but Doing it a second time.

8
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:49,232
Rym: just having biked a lot and exercised a lot over this over the summer so far and all of last Summer we did it way faster than last time And we literally only stopped once on the entire hundred mile ride.

9
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,179
Rym: to eat lunch didn't stop at any point.

10
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,872
Scott: otherwise I mean if you're eating a whole lunch, that's that this.

11
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:54,857
Scott: that's a pretty you know.

12
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:58,151
Rym: yeah, and You know got the camera when you do.

13
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:58,816
Scott: you know you do 100 miles.

14
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,820
Scott: You know if you have the rest stops on an organized ride You're stopping at the rest stops for like a few minutes and eating some just bars or waffles.

15
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,374
Rym: It's like when I would land in the Harlan Valley railroad.

16
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:09,500
Rym: I'd land in one of those rest stops.

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,600
Rym: I basically walk over just shove cheese balls and crackers.

18
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:20,628
Scott: Yeah one long stop.

19
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:26,096
Scott: that's like sitting down and eating food that is equal to several You know and as long as you refill your water.

20
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:26,580
Scott: It's all good.

21
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:36,023
Rym: Yeah but especially because and this is a thing that I've thought about more lately because More in terms of running, but biking it also applies, but I realize a lot of people don't realize this More.

22
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:45,239
Rym: for most people when you do some sort of physical activity, and you're tired if you take a rest You'll be re-energized or perform better after that rest.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:02:15,780
Rym: but if you're Skilled capable fit enough like you've trained hard and done a sport long enough Especially sports that rely on aerobics and you get to the point to where you're operating below your your anaerobic threshold Then the primary limiting factors on things like time distance like doing more with the sport are more around caloric intake injury Joints pain like things that are not resolved by the amount of rest you could do during the activity.

24
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:21,868
Rym: So like on our head when I run a half marathon if I stop for 10 minutes I won't be faster after those 10 minutes.

25
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:25,439
Rym: It just means it'll take me 10 minutes longer to do the exact same run.

26
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:27,565
Rym: Like resting does not know.

27
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,288
Scott: it all depends.

28
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:32,851
Scott: it depends, you know, there's always gonna be just like with your computer There's some sort of bottleneck.

29
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:33,840
Rym: Yeah, what's the bottleneck?

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,698
Scott: You know some people they go biking really far and it's like their legs give up for some people the lung.

31
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:42,469
Rym: some people It's your but like you have the butt sore.

32
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,357
Scott: Yeah, but hurts your butt hurts too much.

33
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:45,140
Scott: They got a stat, right?

34
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,820
Scott: There's always something that is the thing that makes you have to stop right?

35
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,202
Scott: It could.

36
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:51,080
Scott: it doesn't have to be some body thing either.

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,460
Scott: It could be like, you know a fly got in your eyeball or time out of water time.

38
00:02:57,641 --> 00:03:03,083
Rym: Like even if I feel like I could keep going these bike trails close at dusk and it's now Exactly.

39
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:04,551
Rym: I've already biked 100 miles.

40
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,118
Rym: There's nowhere else I can bike.

41
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:08,008
Rym: but so we get to.

42
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:15,155
Rym: we bike up to the Kipsy hundred-ish miles and We're gonna bike over that special pedestrian bridge like the bike path bridge.

43
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:16,380
Scott: the path goes right onto it.

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,240
Rym: Yeah to get to the middle of it and like that's where we'd stop the ride.

45
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:22,520
Rym: It was closed to the public on Sunday.

46
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:26,432
Rym: Okay for a private event that you had to buy tickets for.

47
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:29,543
Scott: well, it's I don't think it's a public Thing.

48
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:30,430
Rym: it normally is.

49
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,740
Rym: so basically there is a bike.

50
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:35,379
Scott: I mean, it's open to the public but I don't know if it's owned by the state?

51
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:35,942
Scott: of this I don't know.

52
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:38,880
Rym: I think it's owned by the state because it was built as part of that Empire project.

53
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:41,931
Scott: Well, I mean, I guess you're allowed to like you could.

54
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:43,680
Rym: I guess the what bothers me is faces.

55
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:46,010
Rym: I didn't realize this could be closed.

56
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,933
Rym: and what bothers me?

57
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:51,978
Rym: so we get there and there's other Bikers who needed to get over it to finish a ride and it was just closed to them.

58
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:53,147
Scott: I didn't need to get.

59
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:53,652
Scott: home is on.

60
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:54,660
Scott: their home was on the other side.

61
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,780
Rym: Yeah, they were planning long rides.

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:02,035
Rym: We actually met a guy who runs one of the like one of the bike activist Organizations that was instrumental in getting that thing built in the first place.

63
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:03,040
Rym: He was there.

64
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:05,120
Rym: He actually took a photo of us and talked to us.

65
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,374
Rym: He was talking to all the bikers who got fucked over by the fact that this thing was closed.

66
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:22,920
Rym: and the big part was if You live far enough away There's no way you'd know some random part of this bike route is just closed to you Especially a bridge where there aren't other good ways over that bridge like this aren't good ways over the Hudson for a bike up there.

67
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,851
Scott: So I could bike over the normal Poughkeepsie bridge.

68
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,700
Scott: right the can you bike over that thing?

69
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:28,944
Scott: I don't know.

70
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:29,950
Scott: You can bike over the new bird.

71
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,640
Rym: I know you can bike over the new brick beacon bridge.

72
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,954
Rym: I've done it, but I don't know if you can bike over that Poughkeepsie one.

73
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,528
Scott: I Don't know.

74
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:36,918
Scott: I never tried.

75
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:44,977
Rym: Yeah But so it was surprising that it was just closed and there was this private event you had to buy tickets for and there are cops Everywhere and it was a whole thing.

76
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,140
Rym: But otherwise, it was a pretty good bike ride.

77
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,055
Rym: I feel like if we do it again, we could do it.

78
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:51,910
Scott: I'd be like look I don't want to go to your private event.

79
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,100
Scott: I just want to go to the other side.

80
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,783
Scott: I'm not gonna help.

81
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:55,490
Rym: they specifically had signs.

82
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,800
Rym: no bikes even allowed on the bridge couldn't even walk him over.

83
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:01,419
Scott: I just I'd be like hey if you bought a ticket I go and fight with them.

84
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,155
Rym: Yeah, so there's no one sneak across.

85
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:05,020
Scott: I'd be like deal with it.

86
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,728
Rym: Yeah, so I'm actually gonna complain to the state.

87
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,193
Rym: my argument.

88
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:10,637
Scott: You're keeping me from going home.

89
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:11,460
Scott: I can't get home.

90
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:11,901
Scott: That's it.

91
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:16,376
Rym: My argument would be this this bridge is a part of the infrastructure.

92
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,640
Rym: now like a freeway.

93
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:25,780
Rym: You can't just close a freeway You have to have a valid like approved detour because people rely on it like the Queensborough Bridge here the bike path.

94
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:27,347
Rym: They can't just close that bike path.

95
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:27,749
Rym: It's open 24/7.

96
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:28,814
Rym: They literally run bus.

97
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,860
Scott: Well, they closed it sometimes but the problem is well when they close it they provide they always alternatives.

98
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:36,274
Scott: You can take the subway.

99
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:37,644
Rym: No, no, no It's not they net.

100
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:49,471
Rym: when they close the Queensborough bridge bike path the city is buses categorically provides a bus that will pick people up on either end with their bikes because bike that bridge is a Critical piece of the bike infrastructure.

101
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:50,840
Rym: They're not allowed to close it.

102
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,620
Scott: I've never seen them have a bus where they let people your bike Scott the fuck you talking about.

103
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:56,632
Rym: We talked about this on GeekNights multiple times.

104
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,020
Rym: Remember when they were doing all that construction.

105
00:05:58,402 --> 00:06:01,619
Rym: They wrote that bus has shown up many times over the years.

106
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,500
Scott: There's a there's frequently alternative shuttle buses for things.

107
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,079
Scott: I've never seen any bus that there's only like a couple pictures of it.

108
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:15,020
Rym: We talked about it on GeekNights because you asked me what was going on when you see if this happens again.

109
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,059
Scott: But I've never seen it happen.

110
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,960
Rym: They literally had a stop with a line and a queue and in front of like around the corner by our apartment.

111
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:28,660
Rym: Everyone who was trying to get over that bridge on a bike or a pedestrian Would queue up and the bus would come back and the trailer car would come back.

112
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:34,140
Rym: They load all the bikes into a trailer They put all the people on the bus and they drove it over the bridge dropped you off and let you pick up your bikes.

113
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:37,817
Rym: And they ran that overnight from like midnight to 6 a.m.

114
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:42,255
Rym: Every day that that pedestrian path was closed because they can't close it.

115
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:43,018
Rym: They're not allowed to.

116
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:45,889
Rym: Anyway, how do you not remember this?

117
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,940
Rym: We talked about this at length on GeekNights multiple times.

118
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:51,452
Scott: I don't remember seeing any bike trailer.

119
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:54,526
Scott: They've seen plenty of shuttle buses anyway.

120
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,105
Rym: in some gaming news This was surprising.

121
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:04,768
Rym: like I was surprised by this I heard like oh there's some update to quake one And I just didn't think anything of it.

122
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,000
Rym: and then Scott was like where I'm paying attention.

123
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:08,808
Scott: No, I wasn't making I was paying attention.

124
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:22,360
Rym: and then so the article I'm linking to was like hey The update happened to quick one like the og quake one, but what the update was Is not only does quake one just work on Steam, which it's always just worked on Steam.

125
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,574
Rym: It was literally the first thing I paid money for on Steam.

126
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:30,356
Rym: I Bought the ID pack that had every ID game up to that point which included quake one.

127
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,080
Rym: It just worked.

128
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:37,820
Rym: They updated it and what they made it do is You can just start a deathmatch game or a co-op game.

129
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:41,171
Rym: You can just click on people's names on Steam and invite them.

130
00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:42,295
Rym: It'll just work.

131
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:46,591
Rym: full cross play room codes matchmaking everything.

132
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:50,383
Rym: quake one now just works for Multiplayer.

133
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:53,175
Scott: Well, that's that's only one thing that was done.

134
00:07:53,235 --> 00:08:04,170
Scott: Yeah that you care about Really happened is that they came out right with a quake one HD remaster which is a thing that many games have been doing ever since.

135
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:08,006
Scott: by on a commando rearmed started that trend way back in the Mid 2000s, right?

136
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:18,405
Scott: So the difference here is that quake one has shown everyone the correct way to do the HD remaster Which is not to do it.

137
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:24,361
Scott: resident evil does where it released a completely new game or to do a Nintendo does release a completely new Game.

138
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:33,679
Scott: that is the same exact thing as the old game where you change some things and you try to correct your mistakes of the Past and you sell it for full price.

139
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:44,207
Scott: All they did was make it work and make it look good the quake one HD remaster is Literally just a patch to quake one.

140
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:46,735
Scott: the original quake one just has been patched.

141
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:53,200
Scott: this many years later 20 plus years later after its release they just patched it to a new version.

142
00:08:53,782 --> 00:09:00,125
Scott: This higher resolution textures support for 4k resolutions, you know But it's just the same.

143
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:04,800
Scott: goddamn game up like go to that updated to work on modern thing.

144
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:13,480
Scott: Go into that count, but obviously if you get it on the Nintendo switch or something instead of your computer There is no original quake one on there to patch.

145
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:18,416
Scott: So you just have to buy quake one and you're gonna get the newest version of it when you do.

146
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:21,512
Scott: So obviously, yeah they've also.

147
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:27,136
Scott: I Don't know if this was done earlier or just done now, but you know quake 64 is a thing.

148
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:34,700
Scott: And the deal with quake 64 is that it does have like different levels, you know, the single-player levels.

149
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:36,447
Scott: So those are now.

150
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:40,865
Scott: I don't know they might have added up as a new development or an old development But those are included.

151
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:43,858
Scott: like you can play the quake 64 levels on your PC.

152
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:50,180
Rym: Now when I have a quake one, the only thing I have not tested is can I get a mod to just work with this?

153
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,138
Scott: Absolutely, yes, you can you just get any get your wad file or whatever it is.

154
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:54,580
Scott: It'll just work.

155
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:56,349
Rym: So my car are you a hundred percent sure?

156
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:58,680
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's what we were doing yesterday.

157
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:01,179
Rym: Those weren't nothing we did yesterday was a mod.

158
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,631
Scott: Yeah was we played on those maps that came in a separate pack.

159
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:08,160
Rym: Nope map map mods are very different from these other mods.

160
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,447
Rym: I'm really what I'm curious to see.

161
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:10,512
Rym: I'm just gonna try to make it work.

162
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:11,960
Scott: I I to mods a mod.

163
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,486
Scott: A map is just a mod pay.

164
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:14,209
Rym: Mmm.

165
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:15,574
Rym: It's a little more complicated than that.

166
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:16,960
Rym: Did you ever mess with quake one mods?

167
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:18,211
Scott: It's gonna work.

168
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:19,260
Scott: it's just quake one.

169
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,324
Scott: It's gonna would you bet?

170
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:21,206
Scott: it's not any different.

171
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:25,079
Rym: would you bet money that I can make mega team fortress work in this quake one?

172
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,727
Scott: Sure, why not?

173
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:27,519
Scott: It will totally work.

174
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,485
Scott: Servers are gonna be.

175
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:35,123
Scott: I don't know if the servers will take because I you know Hedging hedging.

176
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:40,608
Scott: there's hedging detected Scott's not sure now, but if you just load if you load it up just locally It will absolutely work.

177
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:43,883
Scott: that I don't know how they're making the servers Invite.

178
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:48,760
Scott: if this if the server is running on my computer when it does the steam invite then yes, it will work.

179
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,875
Scott: But if the server is running on some third-party server, you know that they have.

180
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,320
Scott: I don't know how they were frustrated.

181
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:55,752
Rym: That means it doesn't work.

182
00:10:55,833 --> 00:11:00,632
Scott: if that's true It does mean it works because you don't have to use that.

183
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:01,959
Scott: you don't have to use the.

184
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:03,104
Scott: You know.

185
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:11,380
Scott: if for some reason the way they set up the networking is not gonna work You could use you could still use the old networking and make it work that way.

186
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,414
Rym: Did you ever install like multiplayer mods for quick water quake to like?

187
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,440
Scott: do you put if you put files in a folder the end?

188
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,526
Rym: More to it than that, but okay.

189
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,200
Scott: Anyway files in a folder, but that's all you got to do.

190
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,642
Scott: It's good.

191
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,669
Scott: You'd even quake three.

192
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:25,877
Scott: You just put files in a folder.

193
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,220
Rym: Anyway, I'm uh, I expect it'll probably just work.

194
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:35,160
Rym: I do also expect that there's no way to make the multiplayer work.

195
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,531
Rym: I expect it's gonna fall over in some way on that, but I'm curious.

196
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:44,748
Scott: the only you know, the issue could be that if It doesn't seem like they've made any change, right?

197
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:47,758
Scott: It's like, you know, I think mods in general will work, right?

198
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:54,177
Rym: But You were sure because I have not seen anyone report on the mods working or because no one's trying.

199
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:57,259
Scott: but yeah I'm gonna do general absolutely work.

200
00:11:57,621 --> 00:12:11,260
Scott: The question is there may be a situation where like a specific mod might have some incompatibility With some specific changes in the latest patch and there might be bugginess, right but Mods in general are gonna work cuz it's still just quake one.

201
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,120
Rym: Yes, we'll see though because all the mods that are interesting were extremely complex and made drastic changes.

202
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:20,540
Rym: I'm really curious to see if mega team fortress will work.

203
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:23,020
Rym: I'm gonna try this week coming weekend because I have a long weekend.

204
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:33,554
Rym: I'm going to earnestly try to make mega team fortress work and if I can make multiplayer work I'm not gonna promise I'll play it with any of you cuz I don't think we could get enough people.

205
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:36,398
Rym: but that'll be interesting to See, that's all I have to say about that.

206
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,223
Rym: If not, I am gonna try to make it work in DOS box anyway Because of a panel.

207
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:46,460
Scott: I feel as though some people get the impression of the kex engine port of quake is difficult or impossible to mod.

208
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,180
Scott: However, from my experience quake mods work just as well with the remaster as they would with other source ports.

209
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:53,270
Scott: It's very easy to install them as well here.

210
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:54,677
Scott: I'll be so.

211
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:56,409
Rym: here's the prize Mod.

212
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,502
Rym: so here's one problem I've run into.

213
00:12:59,064 --> 00:13:05,659
Rym: I did see that people who had tried to make mega TF work on just the quake source Previously had a lot of difficulties.

214
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,104
Rym: No, so we'll see.

215
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,530
Rym: Oh see if it works here.

216
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:09,791
Scott: It works.

217
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:10,494
Scott: Just fine.

218
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:11,357
Rym: Well, what it?

219
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,040
Rym: which mods?

220
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:13,545
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

221
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,200
Scott: But this person's playing some you know, so I don't know a mod they were playing.

222
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:19,576
Rym: Yeah, cuz a lot of mods didn't do much or like you said we're just a map.

223
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:21,711
Rym: That's not the kind of mod I'm even remotely interested in.

224
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:23,920
Scott: All right Play anyway.

225
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,411
Scott: Yes, check to see if arcane dimensions worked and it did.

226
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:29,137
Scott: what about smaller mods?

227
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:29,900
Scott: Yeah, it works.

228
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,320
Scott: Just drag the mod folder to the rerelease folder and type game mock.

229
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:36,050
Scott: You know square bracket mod in the in-game console.

230
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:38,500
Scott: It works pretty much the same as it would with quake spasm.

231
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:39,358
Rym: Yep, so we'll see.

232
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:44,139
Rym: I'm really curious to see if I can make a multiplayer work with one of those advanced mods like mega TF.

233
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:49,602
Scott: But every mod every mod ever people bring you up all kinds of mod names and all of them are saying yes It works.

234
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:55,865
Scott: just you open the console and type game space and the name of the mod folder and all you got to do is Drag the folder into the location.

235
00:13:55,925 --> 00:14:00,558
Rym: No, I've ever got what I will say very specifically if multiplayer doesn't work then the mod doesn't work.

236
00:14:01,946 --> 00:14:02,290
Scott: That's just.

237
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,400
Scott: you're making up some arbitrary.

238
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:11,540
Rym: The whole point of even I wouldn't even I like quake one mods honestly not worth revisiting in the single-player world.

239
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,599
Rym: I'm only interested in multiplayer mods.

240
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:17,047
Scott: Yeah, that's just that's just you only interested in.

241
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:17,589
Scott: but it's just me.

242
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,220
Scott: it works it loads it doesn't crash then it works.

243
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:26,158
Rym: That's a. I mean, I guess by a facile and pointless definition of the word works.

244
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:26,861
Scott: That's true All right.

245
00:14:26,881 --> 00:14:29,691
Scott: Well the next time that you say, oh technically it works.

246
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:32,260
Scott: I'll remember I'll be like, oh, but what about those quake mods?

247
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:33,863
Scott: Cuz you've made the.

248
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:40,569
Scott: you've taken the opposite stance that I am taking right now many times Where you'll just say oh technically it works.

249
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,500
Rym: Yeah, by one debt by one very narrow definition of works.

250
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:44,949
Scott: Hey, yeah, and that's what you do.

251
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:47,142
Scott: allies, you know, but there are definition It works.

252
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:50,175
Scott: what I'm really excited about are on the narrow definition side.

253
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:50,697
Scott: Watch out.

254
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,664
Rym: All right I just don't I'm.

255
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:55,412
Rym: I'll be surprised if the multiplayer works fully.

256
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:57,940
Scott: But anyway, I just don't know how they implemented it.

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,579
Scott: But the multiplayer work is great.

258
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:02,920
Rym: Yeah with regular old deathmatch, which we'll get to in the main bit.

259
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:12,396
Rym: but what I'm also excited about if they do this to quick to Quake 2 is an objectively better deathmatch experience.

260
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:28,940
Rym: like quake 2 just was like Early pinnacle like a peak for its time of game design of that kind of multiplayer and the mod scene for quake 2 Was where things really kicked off like quake 1 was good and important and we really enjoy playing quake 1.

261
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,499
Rym: But quake 2 is what I'm really interested in seeing get the same treatment.

262
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:36,500
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure that I'm telling you this is what that's the main news here right?

263
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,119
Scott: Yeah, like this is how you do an HD remaster, right?

264
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,960
Scott: Anyone who already owns the fucking game should just get the up get up just patch it, right?

265
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,933
Scott: It's like if I've got you know, friggin What's a they did Wind Waker remaster, right?

266
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:56,900
Scott: So I guess it's kind of hard to patch that It's a console game, but let's pretend it wasn't a kind of power of PC games.

267
00:15:57,302 --> 00:16:07,007
Rym: but I think the reason why a lot of people don't do what you describe is Almost and so almost every time I've seen inside info about a remake which hasn't been for many years They want to make money on.

268
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:08,400
Scott: you don't make money doing what they just did.

269
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,224
Rym: Oh, no, not just that.

270
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:12,120
Rym: a lot of companies don't even have the source code to their games anymore.

271
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:13,852
Scott: Everyone has the well quake.

272
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:14,900
Scott: one is open source that helps?

273
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:15,260
Scott: Oh, yeah.

274
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:23,194
Rym: but I'd say there are games that had to be re-implemented from scratch based on play and Reverse engineering of the binaries they release.

275
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:32,599
Rym: that has happened many times Mmm, like there's some public stories about it to have some official Bethesda fact our existing mods supported on PC.

276
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:39,020
Scott: The PC enhanced version will load any mod the original version supported when existing mods have been placed in the install directory.

277
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,815
Scott: It will not support some mods that require a different source port from the original game.

278
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:48,034
Rym: Yeah, that's that's the part I'm a little worried about with mega TF specifically, but we'll see.

279
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,220
Rym: like I said, I'm gonna try it.

280
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:50,385
Rym: I'm gonna try to make it work.

281
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:58,756
Scott: as long as it's a normal mod doesn't require like Where you just put files in a folder as opposed to like modifying the EXE type mod.

282
00:16:59,378 --> 00:16:59,980
Scott: It will function.

283
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,692
Rym: So yep, so we shall see if I can make that work.

284
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,394
Rym: It'll be exciting.

285
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:10,906
Rym: in some other news this was making the rounds and The story was actually for once.

286
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:16,304
Rym: usually when you see a story like this if you actually read the details, it's way less Specific.

287
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:18,680
Rym: but in this case, it was actually quite specific.

288
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:50,128
Rym: The Chinese government has mandated and there will be it looks like there there will be policies and punishments to enforce this that any Online game a game with online multiplayer of any kind or online single-player where someone plays the game online from a client locally Anyone all games must have real identity age verification and anyone who is on an account that is under the age of 18 will only be allowed to play for a total of Three hours per week between 8 p.m.

289
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:50,810
Rym: And 9 p.m.

290
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:51,472
Rym: Local time.

291
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:54,782
Rym: Friday Saturday and Sunday with right It's a little.

292
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:59,500
Scott: I think a lot of articles have written like you only play for three hours a week and that's technically correct.

293
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:07,075
Scott: Yeah It's where way of saying is saying there are only three Specific hours during the week in which play will be available.

294
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:08,280
Scott: three windows, right?

295
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,400
Scott: Yeah, eight to nine o'clock Friday eight to nine o'clock Saturday eight to nine o'clock Sunday.

296
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:14,534
Scott: It's not like oh you could play your three hours on Monday.

297
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:15,360
Scott: No, you can't do that.

298
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,460
Scott: It's like yeah, there are three specific hour time slots and that is when you can play, you know the end.

299
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,920
Rym: So imagine when you were in high school playing quake one.

300
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:29,798
Rym: You could only play the deathmatch between 8 and 9 p.m Friday Saturday and Sunday.

301
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:39,257
Scott: also Holidays, they're gonna put also if there's a holiday I guess like a Chinese national holiday then then between 8 and 9 holiday then between 8 and 9 p.m.

302
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:40,120
Rym: On those holidays.

303
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:41,919
Scott: Yes, exactly now.

304
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:57,931
Scott: So first of all, you know, I think people in the gaming space see this news But you know, I'm also in the the kpop space right and China is doing similar Crackdowns on things of this nature, right?

305
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:04,030
Rym: So online is osmonds online Socializing there like it's a there's a lot all sorts of there.

306
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:09,409
Scott: Yeah, there's all sorts of like these specific, you know I guess cultural restrictions.

307
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:23,880
Scott: They're like, okay, you can't have any of these, you know Competition shows and so, you know, there's like they're identifying things that they think are like, you know Bad for the youths sort of like how when we were in school, they banned Trapper Keepers and all that stuff, right?

308
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:41,477
Scott: So don't bring your Tamagotchi to school only, you know Those rules that we had in school were like really specifically targeting like, you know one thing and they also affected these rules are You know, they're more broad trying to like address the whole issue.

309
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,286
Rym: Well, there's another nuance there.

310
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:45,960
Rym: Those rules only affected us when we were on school property.

311
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,212
Rym: We could do whatever the fuck we wanted.

312
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:48,100
Scott: That's all right.

313
00:19:48,683 --> 00:19:49,527
Scott: But that's not the point.

314
00:19:49,548 --> 00:19:50,875
Scott: I'm trying to make the way I'm trying to make.

315
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:52,102
Scott: is you know The?

316
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:54,260
Scott: the difference is a specific rule, right?

317
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,426
Scott: They're not saying like China wasn't like.

318
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:59,516
Scott: ah that video game is a problem that fortnight.

319
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:00,960
Scott: They weren't like banned fortnight.

320
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:06,299
Scott: They were like, okay, we're gonna ban aiming anything like that because there's anything like that.

321
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,011
Rym: we didn't cover it on GeekNights partly because I like it.

322
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:21,760
Rym: if you don't necessarily want to take the Language and rhetoric in government press releases from foreign nations that face value There's a lot of reasons like think about what American government press releases look like to the outside world.

323
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:46,220
Rym: so a while ago the Chinese government issued a bunch of statements basically saying that Gaming social media and a bunch of other things were effectively quote spiritual opium and there was a lot of rhetoric coming around coming out around how those things are colonial artifacts that should be excised from Chinese society and I've treated that like I would any government rhetoric.

324
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:53,560
Rym: But it seems like with this no new news that the government is now acting on the that rhetoric directly and specifically.

325
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:59,645
Scott: Yeah, I mean this is you know the exact opposite of you know, the What you get.

326
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,980
Scott: in countries like this one this country we can't do anything.

327
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,215
Rym: The government is just like stuck like there should be a little ground like government.

328
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:06,400
Scott: it like China.

329
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,928
Scott: The government's the opposite of stuck.

330
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:08,852
Scott: They want to do something.

331
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,174
Scott: Boom.

332
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:10,420
Scott: They just fucking do it, right?

333
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,659
Scott: They're like just getting shit done.

334
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:18,036
Scott: The problem is half the shit they're getting done is evil and genocide and the other half of this shit They're getting done is actually yeah, maybe not the worst.

335
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,486
Scott: America Kind of cancels out.

336
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:24,720
Rym: America's genocide comes from the free market as opposed to from an authoritarian power.

337
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:27,352
Rym: So it's exactly I make a quote marks.

338
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:29,080
Rym: You can't see that if you're not watching the live stream.

339
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:34,359
Rym: But exactly this is obviously a problem partly for a lot of reasons.

340
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:46,120
Rym: but I wonder how this is actually going to affect the Chinese gaming ecosystem because Part of what's going on here that you there's other articles you can read if you want to read about what what like the index

341
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:48,568
Scott: There are some positives to it China,

342
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,239
Rym: I would argue there are no positives to this specific rule.

343
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:53,386
Rym: This is an egregious over.

344
00:21:53,426 --> 00:22:00,620
Scott: You're not gonna have kids, you know, they get less kids gambling away on some gotcha games But there's lots of non gotcha games that exist that are enriching.

345
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,449
Scott: You won't grow up paying.

346
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:02,499
Scott: you won't grow up paying to win.

347
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:04,167
Scott: I guess it less likely you'll grow up paying.

348
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:07,942
Rym: if I had not been able to play the non gotcha video games that I played Growing up.

349
00:22:08,023 --> 00:22:11,140
Rym: I would be a radically different person today and probably a worse person.

350
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,439
Scott: Yeah, no, I didn't I said but it's at least you if you grew up today.

351
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:24,548
Rym: We like we recognize that gotcha games and these gambling mechanics are harmful and I would welcome Nuanced carefully mandated restrictions.

352
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:27,937
Scott: They've thrown the baby out with the bathwater, but they did throw out the bathwater.

353
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:38,399
Rym: We're sitting in bathwater Yeah, but what all what's also going on is the Chinese government has increasingly been cracking down on Chinese large technology companies that they see as a threat to their own power.

354
00:22:39,263 --> 00:22:40,588
Scott: Yeah, and you know, that's it.

355
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:42,235
Scott: and the one again, it's like yeah.

356
00:22:42,557 --> 00:22:47,720
Scott: in the United States We let companies be as powerful as they want more powerful than the government and that's anti-democratic.

357
00:22:48,122 --> 00:22:56,016
Scott: China isn't democratic to begin with so they just shut down anything that Approaches their level of power to make sure the government is always the most powerful thing.

358
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,279
Scott: in the United States The government isn't powerful enough.

359
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:08,672
Rym: But I feel I feel like what's gonna happen here is the rest of the world's gaming is going to increasingly just like with the internet Basically cut itself off from the Chinese market.

360
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:10,179
Scott: because well, yeah, you're not why would you?

361
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:15,900
Scott: well You're not gonna unless you're making a game just for adults only, you know, you're not expecting children to play your game.

362
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,974
Scott: Then you're just not gonna even bother trying to sell in China.

363
00:23:19,994 --> 00:23:21,340
Scott: You're not gonna translate into Chinese.

364
00:23:21,662 --> 00:23:25,000
Scott: I would even less likely to considering the rhetoric out of the government.

365
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:28,079
Scott: I would be leery Chinese people outside of China that you might want to.

366
00:23:28,427 --> 00:23:34,552
Rym: Oh, yeah I'm saying going after the Chinese Market itself as in the market of people living in mainland China who may play your game.

367
00:23:34,572 --> 00:23:39,203
Rym: exactly that market is gonna come with so much Baggage like this.

368
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:45,361
Rym: like if you run a game there you have to do real ID age checks to enforce this rule or you get Fucked.

369
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:45,923
Scott: Yep.

370
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:52,183
Scott: Well, I mean companies already have their own separate Chinese servers example, like, you know battle net or you know Any of those right?

371
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:56,138
Rym: So like you can't just get on Tiananmen Square on those servers like for real.

372
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:56,740
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

373
00:23:56,941 --> 00:23:58,025
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, they're.

374
00:23:58,246 --> 00:23:59,331
Scott: they're probably just gonna.

375
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:04,812
Scott: the difference is like now I guess only Unless you're between those three hours, right?

376
00:24:04,852 --> 00:24:08,643
Scott: The battle net server will cut off all the kids from playing Diablo or over what.

377
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:09,868
Rym: here's some other things that are interesting.

378
00:24:09,888 --> 00:24:21,889
Rym: whatever this crackdown which seems not just to be aimed at controlling society But also at reining in the powerful companies many of which are making a lot of money from online gaming like 10-cent many of which Companies are not Chinese companies, right?

379
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:25,140
Scott: Basically taking money from Chinese kids and bringing it over to this side.

380
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:33,919
Rym: Yep, but there's been another side of this where Chinese companies were heavily investing in the gaming industry and sector Which was starting to drive?

381
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:54,820
Rym: the sensibilities of Online especially lower tier gacha style game design in countries outside of China because those companies Taking that investment also wanted to reach the Chinese market and would implement Without saying too much out loud Themselves a lot of Chinese censorship rules to not run afoul of problems in that market.

382
00:24:55,202 --> 00:25:13,700
Rym: I feel like if that economic ecosystem the investment ecosystem is under attack You're gonna see non Chinese government controlled gaming companies Increasingly start to back away from what they've been doing where they've been Following Chinese rules if they weren't required to to have access to that market if the markets gonna be destroyed.

383
00:25:13,861 --> 00:25:17,796
Rym: Anyway, why even bother following those rules that you didn't have to follow in the first place.

384
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:18,880
Scott: That's true.

385
00:25:19,022 --> 00:25:20,320
Rym: I think this is gonna be a positive.

386
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,900
Scott: I think it's also sort of a. you know how in Russia we see this sort of thing with the ransomware, right?

387
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:42,779
Scott: Well, we know it's mostly these Russian dudes are doing the ransomware But the rule the unspoken rule is that they don't ransomware other Russians right because they're trying to bring money into Russia Even if it's into the hands of a few evil dudes and not have money, you know, you're not ripping off your own country, right?

388
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,363
Scott: Damaging yourself.

389
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:52,847
Scott: So in this much in the same way here Chinese companies making all sorts of gacha games Taking money from kids around the world.

390
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,978
Scott: just hey, we're not gonna take money from Chinese kids.

391
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,231
Scott: Yeah But don't hurt.

392
00:25:58,271 --> 00:25:59,399
Scott: don't hurt your own people.

393
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:02,853
Scott: Yeah, take money from around the world and bring it to China.

394
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,480
Scott: don't hurt our own people though.

395
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:08,398
Rym: That's why my hope here is that what about what the side effect of this will be?

396
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,799
Rym: Non Chinese game companies start to back away from Chinese censorship rules because they can't?

397
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,582
Rym: well I think it's.

398
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:27,660
Scott: those two things make me think there might be a sort of you know, cultural slash economic Warfare thing going on where basically, you know Countries allow companies to engage and exploit.

399
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:33,780
Rym: Shadow run is real except without elves and sex bots, right?

400
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:53,710
Scott: It's like okay in every country is like allows itself to host Country companies and those companies are allowed to engage in you know Evil business practices that are exploitative as long as it only engages in the exploitative business practices against God Foreign consumers, but not local any local because everyone will.

401
00:26:54,010 --> 00:27:00,910
Scott: anyone who doesn't want to get exploited make sure to only consume local Because they're not allowed to rip off the locals.

402
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,147
Rym: This is just privateering in the digital era Pretty much.

403
00:27:05,228 --> 00:27:06,640
Rym: It's just literal privateering.

404
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:16,004
Scott: Anyway China's doing if you look if you look around China's been doing this more and more and more to mostly things kids are interested in.

405
00:27:16,572 --> 00:27:18,104
Scott: you know Music.

406
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:29,060
Rym: yeah now where I think this might backfire is because in many cases Often the Chinese government like the people in acting these policies do seem to earnestly believe in these ideological lines.

407
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:33,834
Scott: Well, I mean, I think to some extent they are gonna get some of what they ask.

408
00:27:33,894 --> 00:27:36,762
Scott: Oh, yeah, right is like, you know It's.

409
00:27:36,842 --> 00:27:44,900
Scott: obviously it's not it's not perfect like you would imagine it but it's like yeah without the video games The kids are probably gonna you know, do my work.

410
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,427
Rym: That is where I was.

411
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:54,285
Rym: so say that this is someone is my guess is that the mistake They have made in these policies.

412
00:27:54,787 --> 00:27:58,918
Rym: Is that the children who have more access to gaming as a whole?

413
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:08,377
Rym: Knowing that there is a harmful aspect of gaming with gacha games Will probably have better outcomes and the Jane McGonigal attack of gaming makes people better.

414
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:17,728
Scott: as long as the games are good I feel like well But you're only cut off from multiplayer games and your parents could still let you play in their account and you can play all The local non online games.

415
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:25,160
Scott: you reading what and if you're a really cool Chinese kid You'll set up a LAN party at your house to play multiplayer games that way.

416
00:28:25,481 --> 00:28:29,460
Scott: So there could be a market for games with LAN support in China for multi.

417
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,296
Rym: I do though suspect that this is a presses to further crackdowns on gaming in mainland China.

418
00:28:34,316 --> 00:28:36,418
Rym: I Think this is just the beginning.

419
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,569
Rym: This is far from over and it's going to get.

420
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:46,674
Scott: I think that based on the rhetoric that let Basically anything that becomes too popular with the kids that they see as harmful.

421
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:49,020
Scott: They've already, you know established this pattern.

422
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:59,247
Scott: They are going to restrict or crack down on it in some way Right either completely banning it or in this case in other cases just limiting the parts of it that they see that are like not Cool.

423
00:28:59,267 --> 00:28:59,615
Scott: Yeah, right.

424
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:01,480
Scott: So it's like with the kpop thing.

425
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:05,140
Scott: I don't know the details because I read the article a while ago and didn't read too closely.

426
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:10,460
Scott: But it's like they didn't ban like singing and dancing and music shows on TV, right?

427
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:17,440
Scott: They banned like this sort of competitive aspect that a lot of the shows have because they saw a lot of like fan culture.

428
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:21,840
Scott: Well, you know full of people, you know, like, you know attacking each other, right?

429
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,829
Scott: And that's the part that they thought was bad, right?

430
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:28,020
Scott: So it's like in Korea, you'll just see like these straight-up competition shows.

431
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,055
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, this group's better than that group and whatnot.

432
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:33,340
Scott: They're like they banned in China.

433
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,948
Scott: They banned like ranking type stuff, right?

434
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:36,209
Scott: You're not.

435
00:29:36,229 --> 00:29:43,680
Scott: no more rankings, you know, there was a lot of things where you know They would like have fans send in money or click on votes to like.

436
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,693
Scott: You know get their group their favorite group ranked higher than the other one.

437
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:48,300
Scott: Yeah, they crack down on that sort of thing.

438
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:49,525
Scott: All right, they're not like.

439
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:51,533
Scott: hey no more singing and dancing pop music.

440
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:52,758
Scott: They're they're keeping that.

441
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,246
Rym: so The part that they see is negative.

442
00:29:54,266 --> 00:30:04,446
Scott: in this case kids playing online games for too long instead of doing something else or That's they crack down on only that part.

443
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:08,498
Scott: right they didn't crack down on just no game no video games for any kid ever yet.

444
00:30:10,701 --> 00:30:20,727
Rym: Yeah, and you know, so well a telling point that we'll move on is I have some numbers here Nettie's which net ease Gaming company in Chinese gaming company.

445
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:24,299
Rym: Their stock was down 8% immediately after this news.

446
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,272
Rym: Oh, yeah, ten cent dropped but less.

447
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:29,100
Rym: but ten cent owns a lot of non gaming stuff.

448
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:39,000
Scott: Also, even though ten cents a Chinese company a lot of the customers are not Chinese children, yep Net ease has more invested in that specific.

449
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:42,199
Rym: And in one more news.

450
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:46,660
Rym: This is just a cloud link to a couple of Twitter threads that can sort of go more into this.

451
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:58,259
Rym: But if you like tabletop games and you're not paying attention to the tabletop industry Which frankly most tabletop gamers don't and that's fine Like most people most people like movies But don't pay attention to the movie industry.

452
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:05,739
Rym: Tabletop games are about to get like four to ten times more expensive and this is not gonna get better anytime.

453
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:07,566
Rym: soon Tabletop is entering.

454
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:09,013
Scott: There's a lot of reasons for it.

455
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:10,299
Scott: I actually I welcome it.

456
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:17,320
Rym: Yeah, I mean the tabletop has gotten to the point where there's definitely a bubble of too many games too many small publishers.

457
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:19,439
Rym: It's starting to contract again.

458
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:21,570
Scott: You can have too many.

459
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,465
Scott: I don't want to say there's too many games too many small Publishers.

460
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,599
Scott: right because I don't think you can have too many.

461
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:32,400
Rym: I would say I don't think I don't think you can and I think there should be a huge number of small independent publishers.

462
00:31:33,002 --> 00:31:37,340
Rym: I don't think the market can bear that many and most of these games right getting bought right in cat.

463
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,750
Scott: I think that there's too many.

464
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,260
Scott: there's not too many games.

465
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,040
Scott: There's too many people attempting to live off of those games.

466
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,424
Rym: Also live streaming.

467
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:55,131
Rym: like I don't there are way more hours of live stream content made than every human on earth could watch and that There's only so much money in tabletop to go around.

468
00:31:55,572 --> 00:31:58,140
Scott: So, you know, it's like it's great that I love.

469
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,017
Scott: I want more people to make more games all the time, you know as many as we can get.

470
00:32:02,077 --> 00:32:06,340
Scott: all the new ideas Just you know a flourishing ecosystem of new games all over the place.

471
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:14,793
Scott: But the people some people have to realize that like yeah, you know, even if you've got some you know players for your game That might not be enough to live on.

472
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:15,720
Scott: don't go, you know.

473
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:18,360
Scott: Don't go down that road and risk your livelihood on that.

474
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,735
Rym: So in a nutshell, but there's many more factors at play, but the biggest ones are one.

475
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:25,480
Rym: remember that Suez Canal problem.

476
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:26,164
Rym: There's.

477
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,900
Rym: the echoes of that are still affecting the global economy.

478
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,460
Scott: Well, it's not that specifically that one problem, but it's basically global shipping, right?

479
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,306
Scott: You have a situations where there are.

480
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,380
Scott: there are like docks where they're just boats sitting out there because it's not enough dock.

481
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:43,751
Rym: The first one is that that one incident had.

482
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:46,460
Rym: we have still not recovered from that one incident in it.

483
00:32:46,742 --> 00:32:49,700
Scott: That's that's small compared to some of the other shipping problems.

484
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,220
Scott: There's a lot of shipping problems that are all on top of each other.

485
00:32:53,280 --> 00:33:04,040
Rym: It's bigger than you'd think but the recovery from that was made harder because what you just brought up There aren't enough workers and any of the ports of call current in some places in the world is not enough containers.

486
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:06,280
Scott: Yeah, basically shipping is a problem, right?

487
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:17,619
Scott: So board games you usually most of them are printed in China and shipped on boats literal boats to the unit to do the rest Of the speaking of China between tariffs political issues and everything else going on.

488
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:21,613
Rym: It's getting harder to interact with Chinese manufacturers.

489
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:24,263
Rym: unless you are big so small Printing.

490
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:24,826
Scott: just.

491
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:26,755
Scott: there aren't a lot of other places to print.

492
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:27,680
Scott: They're more expensive.

493
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,029
Scott: Most people who are making tabletop games.

494
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:36,889
Scott: the trend these days is to make a big fancy game with lots of shit in it And not a nice little time.

495
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:38,980
Scott: you make a nice little tiny game like a deck of cards.

496
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,540
Scott: You can probably just have it printed in the u.s You know, no problem.

497
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:50,080
Scott: Well soon as you want components beyond a deck of cards some basic six-sided dice We get your big old box full of miniatures and boards and plastic shit.

498
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:56,800
Rym: It's like nope, even just cardboard like more complex shapes in cardboard hard to get in the u.s I'm actually gonna read it.

499
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:01,329
Rym: I'm gonna quote Restoration games because they were talking about this at length a while ago.

500
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:07,711
Rym: quote and before anyone asks about printing domestically It is literally not feasible for 90% of games.

501
00:34:07,732 --> 00:34:19,931
Rym: There are no domestic manufacturers Capable to the door able to do what most modern games require and definitely not enough to handle the current demand Like yeah most components that your game.

502
00:34:19,953 --> 00:34:21,300
Scott: if you want to print your game in the u.s.

503
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,196
Scott: It literally has to be like deck of cards.

504
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:24,302
Scott: That's it That kind of game.

505
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:29,034
Rym: or as soon as you get any have to build the capacity yourself and guess what.

506
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:31,080
Rym: that is not feasible.

507
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:40,976
Scott: or you can if you made your game out of just standard components You know, like just green meeple wooden cube, you know d6, right?

508
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:50,638
Rym: You could go you could then you can maybe make your game Maybe but even then those things are also in high demand because wood got very expensive.

509
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:58,100
Rym: the non Shipping supply chain is under extreme pressure not just from kovat but a lot of things are higher priority to ship than board games.

510
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:04,836
Rym: Yep Like the US housing market is struggling with the limited supply of lumber versus the demand which has.

511
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:08,527
Scott: if you're losing a bit I've heard it lumber is easing.

512
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:18,340
Rym: But if you look at the list of people to ship lumber to When there is limited supply board game manufacturing is near the bottom of that list, right?

513
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:18,956
Scott: Well, you got it.

514
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,842
Scott: you know the shipping.

515
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:27,189
Scott: the thing with the shipping is you see there'll be a boat right and the boat can hold so much stuff and You want to pay to get your stuff on that boat.

516
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:34,510
Scott: Well, the a lot of people want to get their stuff on that boat Not just people with board games other people and there's only so much space.

517
00:35:34,912 --> 00:35:36,599
Scott: So the price for that space goes up.

518
00:35:37,061 --> 00:35:45,890
Scott: and if the price of that space goes up too much Which it has then depending on your product it may or may not be worth it to even go on the boat at all.

519
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:46,238
Scott: Right.

520
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:57,537
Scott: It's like okay I could put my board game on that boat But the cost to do so would be so high That I would lose all my money and I would be like in the negative even if I sold every copy of the game I put on that boat at MSRP.

521
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:00,650
Scott: I would be like in the hole a zillion dollars now there.

522
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,650
Scott: So what am I gonna do?

523
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:07,708
Scott: Just let my board game sit on the other side of the world and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait.

524
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:08,913
Rym: now there Might be one.

525
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:11,223
Scott: I'm not making any money because I'm not selling any games.

526
00:36:11,263 --> 00:36:12,850
Scott: I don't have anything to sell my stores empty.

527
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:17,417
Rym: There might be one minor positive side effect in that because I had a news I was gonna talk about.

528
00:36:17,457 --> 00:36:24,930
Rym: we just didn't do a show about Counterfeit board games because they've been rampant and like Amazon's trying to crack down partly because they're not gonna come over either.

529
00:36:25,311 --> 00:36:26,094
Rym: Yeah, cuz guess what?

530
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:30,150
Rym: It's just as hard to make a counterfeit as the real thing in this current environment.

531
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:41,221
Scott: Well, I mean even if you made the counterfeit, you know, you can cut off your price with regards to the IP you can but He's yeah, the shipping cost the same for everybody.

532
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:41,442
Scott: So

533
00:36:41,905 --> 00:37:16,732
Rym: yep, so my Advice Like the basically if you're a tabletop designer and you don't have plans around this honestly, the best thing you can probably do is pause stuff try to shrink operations or now is the time to work on designs of games that will come out three or four years from now like the big ones or invest now in pivoting to digital because I think the future of Complex tabletop board gaming honestly, and I think this might be a catalyst to drive this more is you build digital first you release digital Play.

534
00:37:16,772 --> 00:37:21,610
Rym: testing at scale via digital is how you get your final version and the physical game.

535
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:23,400
Scott: It might even make the physical one.

536
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,559
Rym: then because a lot of people still like the physical one I still want to play a few people.

537
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,812
Scott: that'll be like a niche like bonus thing I would.

538
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,030
Rym: I still prefer to play physical route over a digital route.

539
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,524
Rym: I only play digital route because I can't easily play physical route right now.

540
00:37:35,906 --> 00:37:36,930
Scott: digital route is just way better.

541
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,794
Scott: It's so much faster.

542
00:37:37,814 --> 00:37:40,264
Scott: You don't have to get it takes so much less time.

543
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:41,850
Scott: You don't have to look up rules.

544
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,361
Rym: I'm saying just you design that what.

545
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:50,210
Rym: the one of the primary things that makes tabletop good We talked about this a lot on GeekNights Is that you designed around?

546
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,739
Rym: physical constraints and it forced your game to be more elegant.

547
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,988
Rym: even if you weren't trying to be elegant design your sure.

548
00:37:55,028 --> 00:37:57,798
Scott: design your Game as if it were physical and digital.

549
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:03,950
Rym: I think the future is you design for physical you deliver digital Then you get all the play testing feedback.

550
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:15,209
Rym: So you don't have to issue like version 1.1 of root with stickers to fix problems And then once the game is mature you release a special physical edition for the hardcore nutbags like us who want to own it.

551
00:38:15,892 --> 00:38:17,861
Scott: And I'm not I don't need to hard.

552
00:38:18,243 --> 00:38:21,293
Scott: I'm perfectly happy not to own Physical one.

553
00:38:21,453 --> 00:38:24,022
Rym: I do prefer playing tabletop games in person with people.

554
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:26,270
Rym: My only exception to that honestly is train games.

555
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,260
Rym: I will never play one of those in person again in my life.

556
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:31,315
Scott: I Got the one either.

557
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:33,044
Scott: There's the one train the New England when I ordered.

558
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:34,310
Scott: I think I'll play that one in person.

559
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:35,075
Rym: Good luck.

560
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:37,030
Rym: I will play it with you on 18xx games.

561
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:49,897
Rym: It goes on there But anyway things of the day.

562
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:50,818
Rym: so check this out.

563
00:38:50,858 --> 00:39:01,593
Rym: this is an academic paper Cornell University Under the economic theoretical economics category and it is titled fairer chess.

564
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:06,880
Rym: a reversal of two opening moves in chess creates balance between white and black.

565
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:15,240
Rym: The tldr is if you have the start of chess be a snake like how settlers starts.

566
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:23,480
Rym: It seems it might actually Eliminate the difference between black and white meaning the first turn first mover advantage.

567
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:32,048
Rym: That is huge if true and it looks plausible based on this paper And this is something fascinating that I'm surprised.

568
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:36,280
Rym: No one has positive this before or if they have why no one noticed.

569
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:49,236
Scott: Well, I think you know it's that we have settlers is a good example right and settlers they recognize this sort of this first mover advantage when you're setting up and putting out Your initial settlements and then as soon as the game starts you go around in a circle.

570
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:50,823
Scott: Yep, right It's like.

571
00:39:50,843 --> 00:39:52,831
Scott: well, why don't you just keep sneaking the whole damn game?

572
00:39:53,052 --> 00:39:55,121
Scott: if you recognize that that's fairer Why not?

573
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:55,744
Scott: Just keep it up.

574
00:39:56,066 --> 00:39:58,900
Scott: Why do you have to and then you think other games?

575
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:16,392
Scott: I think what happens is that games tend to either be simultaneous play just go in a circle or they have some other turn mechanism like there's an action to become the first player or you bid to be the first player or in Power grid you arrange the turn order based on how many cities.

576
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:18,560
Scott: you have all these sorts of other mechanisms, right?

577
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,353
Scott: Once you need a better turn order there you invent a new turn order mechanism.

578
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:25,679
Scott: That's better than a snake that goes back and forth.

579
00:40:28,081 --> 00:40:39,680
Scott: Yeah, I guess there are a lot of games out there even two-player games that are still just take turns in a circle and There's often, you know backgammon chess checkers.

580
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:45,380
Scott: It's like even if you just start the game with a snake like player one goes first then player two goes twice.

581
00:40:45,884 --> 00:40:47,477
Scott: Yeah, right and then you know.

582
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,820
Rym: Well, this is back to something we've talked about a lot in convention panels Like we talked about the lot and play to win a bunch of game mechanics.

583
00:40:54,081 --> 00:41:01,200
Rym: We've brought this point up so many times and the point is very much that Turn order is something that a lot of game designers just ignore.

584
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:04,977
Rym: They just oh, we'll go clockwise don't worry about it and they focus on the rest of their game.

585
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:10,519
Rym: yet Turn order is often the primary and sometimes sole determiner of victory in perfect play.

586
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,695
Scott: If it's a turn based game turn order matters a lot.

587
00:41:13,736 --> 00:41:22,400
Rym: Yeah, and Many tabletop board games of the German persuasion like the ones we like the the hobbyists your quote serious weird different.

588
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,660
Rym: Whatever, however, you want to categorize those board games.

589
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:28,753
Rym: They often have mechanics around manipulating turn order for a very good reason.

590
00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:34,745
Rym: And yeah, that's just a blind spot in most game design For whatever you know, that's it.

591
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:44,679
Scott: I mean, I think it's relatively, you know recent like a few decades recent You know people making games with different kinds of turn order actually experimenting with that.

592
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:49,719
Scott: And so any old game that's so old and entrenched like chess where no one's.

593
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:55,450
Scott: you know There's alternate versions plenty of them But no one's changing the rules of the original right.

594
00:41:55,651 --> 00:42:01,771
Scott: if any games that are older than a few decades that are still around The turn order is sort of stuck in a bad way.

595
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:04,040
Scott: Yeah, no reason you can't play Monopoly with the snake.

596
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,904
Scott: It's probably just better.

597
00:42:04,924 --> 00:42:06,370
Rym: They almost definitely.

598
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,117
Scott: no reason you can't play Scrabble with a snake.

599
00:42:08,137 --> 00:42:08,900
Scott: It's probably just better.

600
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,465
Rym: I suspect the prob.

601
00:42:10,605 --> 00:42:20,999
Scott: a reason for this is I bet some game designers literally don't even think about it But in fact Scrabble would probably be the best if like whoever has the lowest score goes next or something like that.

602
00:42:21,924 --> 00:42:23,960
Rym: But I suspect part of it.

603
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:29,130
Scott: Whoever's seen whoever's seen the fewest tiles from the back Whoever's drawn the fewest tiles from the back?

604
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,160
Scott: you track of how many tiles each person is drawn.

605
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:34,611
Scott: So whoever's seen the fewest new tiles gets to keep guess.

606
00:42:34,631 --> 00:42:43,663
Rym: so my counterpoint for game designers who do recognize this I have noticed in my entire gaming life that a lot of people struggle Profoundly.

607
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:48,045
Rym: if any game doesn't just go clockwise Well, it's hard to keep.

608
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:49,652
Scott: you need a mechanism to keep track.

609
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,360
Scott: that doesn't compete even with those mechanisms.

610
00:42:51,522 --> 00:43:04,780
Rym: I see people just repeatedly mess it up forever and It's something that if you have a non-standard turn already have to deal with but a snake you don't have to deal with it Because the snake is still a very simple pattern and literally the new chess move.

611
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:14,054
Rym: Like if you follow these rules, it's just white then black then black goes again Then white then white goes again, and then you alternate for the rest of the game.

612
00:43:14,235 --> 00:43:14,536
Rym: That's it.

613
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:15,560
Rym: That's the only change.

614
00:43:16,742 --> 00:43:18,208
Scott: Well, I didn't know why would white goes.

615
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,880
Scott: I thought it would just be white black black white black white black.

616
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,808
Scott: In the game.

617
00:43:22,928 --> 00:43:25,800
Rym: the game normally would be alternating white black white black white black.

618
00:43:26,242 --> 00:43:29,660
Rym: All you do is group all moves into pairs first.

619
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:33,980
Rym: So white black white black white black then just flip the second one.

620
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:35,625
Rym: That's the only change.

621
00:43:36,007 --> 00:43:39,499
Rym: so it goes white black black white white black white black white black.

622
00:43:40,021 --> 00:43:41,788
Rym: That is the change specifically.

623
00:43:42,149 --> 00:43:43,856
Rym: It's easy if you see it written out.

624
00:43:43,897 --> 00:43:44,680
Rym: It makes a lot more sense.

625
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:46,139
Scott: Yeah, that does make a lot more sense.

626
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:50,700
Rym: But I was just thinking you know I had to say when I read the paper like I had their same struggle.

627
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:55,160
Rym: But then when I saw the little diagram of like what the turn order looked like it just clicked instantly.

628
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:57,025
Scott: Yeah, I think it would.

629
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:59,998
Scott: would it still be fair to just go, you know, white black?

630
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:07,860
Rym: Because the paper Specifically makes the argument that this exact change makes the game fair.

631
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,310
Scott: Yeah, it's still I think.

632
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,740
Scott: I. you know, it seems good.

633
00:44:12,804 --> 00:44:14,920
Scott: No, I'd also better than just going white black white black.

634
00:44:15,662 --> 00:44:18,412
Rym: So the most salient point though, I'm just gonna read this little sentence.

635
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:19,556
Rym: Do you think of the day?

636
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:20,439
Rym: Is that?

637
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,259
Rym: Because humans playing chess, it doesn't fucking matter.

638
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:25,787
Rym: It only matters for machines because the way chess is.

639
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:30,820
Rym: but quote this conclusion is supported by computer analysis of chefs chess openings.

640
00:44:31,604 --> 00:44:32,107
Scott: Oh, that's true.

641
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:36,752
Scott: Chess is a really easy game to test this with because yeah You can just have computers play it against each other to see.

642
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:39,266
Scott: yeah, the results are Yeah, so what do you guys?

643
00:44:39,286 --> 00:44:40,432
Scott: we could do the same thing with checkers.

644
00:44:40,452 --> 00:44:41,880
Scott: we can get some checkers playing computers.

645
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:45,390
Rym: The problem is I think with checkers.

646
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:48,100
Rym: It doesn't matter because checkers is is.

647
00:44:48,943 --> 00:44:50,650
Scott: The solution would say the same.

648
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,417
Rym: the solution is a draw no matter what.

649
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:55,629
Scott: so I don't think Snaking would it not be a draw if you change the turn order.

650
00:44:55,810 --> 00:45:02,000
Rym: if you change the turn order and checkers either it would Guarantee that white wins or it would still guarantee a draw.

651
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:04,700
Rym: I don't know that there's any way to figure that out.

652
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:13,654
Rym: But brute force because checkers was solved by brute force and I don't think we would just basically change the turn order and run The brute force again and see what the first was done like 20 years ago.

653
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:15,080
Rym: So I wonder if we could do it faster.

654
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:20,799
Rym: I'm I'm uh, I'm not invested enough to think about this beyond what we just said, but someone else go figure that out

655
00:45:22,123 --> 00:45:34,179
Scott: okay, so My thing of the day this YouTube channel is apparently quite old I guess but YouTube told me about it recently probably because I was watching like some factories and things of that nature and this is Somewhat-related.

656
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,192
Rym: Tangentially, it's all related to gears video.

657
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:38,519
Rym: We watched once a long time ago.

658
00:45:39,201 --> 00:45:41,287
Scott: Yeah, so this is dude in Texas somewhere.

659
00:45:41,307 --> 00:45:52,836
Scott: He runs a transmission business called precision transmissions and you know it's like okay, it's a dude fixing transmissions, but First of all an automatic transmission.

660
00:45:52,897 --> 00:45:58,440
Scott: It's like yeah Yeah, I know the principle of how one works because I'm a nerdy guy who reads the internet and such, right?

661
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:04,539
Scott: I know the principle but you open up an actual automatic transmission and look inside and it's like what the fuck?

662
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:12,400
Scott: Yeah It's like so that's hydraulic and that's electronic and that's a valve and that's a clutch and there's the planetary gears.

663
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:16,360
Scott: it's like you can understand some of the parts on their own and then you put them all together and just like.

664
00:46:17,594 --> 00:46:22,412
Scott: but This guy has a YouTube channel and basically he takes apart transmissions.

665
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:27,320
Scott: He this guy knows more about Transmissions than I know about computers.

666
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:33,116
Scott: He doesn't know so much and he's breaking on all the parts and he can really specific things.

667
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:36,046
Scott: He's like, oh, yeah this washer He's like it's too thick too thin.

668
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:38,235
Scott: Oh, yeah, you can see that one's worn out.

669
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:39,600
Scott: You got to replace this one.

670
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:43,385
Scott: It's like, you know, you could do this or you could do that but this one cost a lot is it?

671
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:52,600
Scott: it's like even if you don't give a shit about cars or hate cars or You know whether you don't even care about how a car works.

672
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:53,583
Scott: It's just really.

673
00:46:53,683 --> 00:47:03,956
Scott: it's always fascinating and enjoyable to see someone who knows a shit ton about something Breaking down that something and this channel as like they're doing so many videos on here.

674
00:47:03,996 --> 00:47:05,521
Scott: It's like wow, this is real good There's.

675
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:07,548
Rym: I subscribed immediately after you sent me the ladies.

676
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:09,495
Scott: Yeah, it's like did you just?

677
00:47:09,515 --> 00:47:10,780
Scott: he just brings out a transmission?

678
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,260
Scott: He's like, okay, here I am again.

679
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,146
Scott: Let's open up this and some of the videos.

680
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:19,884
Scott: the most the most entertaining videos are the ones of the transmissions real busted That the best one.

681
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:25,180
Scott: he opened one up and like black sludge came out and it was smelling real bad.

682
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:27,333
Scott: And he was like, yeah, you should be glad you're not here.

683
00:47:27,353 --> 00:47:28,299
Scott: this thing stay.

684
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:37,816
Rym: I can say that I know what a busted transition transmission smells like because I had one go on my Sun fire Did did what looked like mud come out of it it?

685
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:44,400
Rym: They were taking they were messing with it to decide if it was even salvageable and it smelled like something died.

686
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:51,725
Scott: Yeah Be sort of like red magenta Translucent color.

687
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:54,620
Scott: so if mud is in the transmission, that's y'all kind of bad.

688
00:47:54,781 --> 00:47:56,794
Rym: But like the best way to describe it is.

689
00:47:56,855 --> 00:48:02,880
Rym: it smelled Like the smell of when an animal has died in the woods and you're like bike past that animal.

690
00:48:03,942 --> 00:48:07,800
Scott: He also was telling stories about finding like, you know, like bees living in transmission.

691
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,146
Scott: I don't see any of that.

692
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:11,979
Scott: there might be videos that I haven't seen because there's a lot of.

693
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:14,159
Rym: yeah I know what I'm looking for on YouTube after we do the show.

694
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,460
Scott: These are in my transmission watch.

695
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,283
Rym: There's a whole like.

696
00:48:18,464 --> 00:48:25,618
Scott: if you've never seen the inside of an auto dramatic transmission or seen how one works Then I even more highly recommend this channel because you're gonna.

697
00:48:26,421 --> 00:48:34,427
Scott: Every single almost every single person who has a car has bought one of these ridiculous machines that someone invented at some point Right.

698
00:48:34,548 --> 00:48:35,618
Scott: It's like holy shit.

699
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:41,640
Scott: You have one of these that you probably have one or more than one of these things and you don't even realize it.

700
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,299
Scott: It's like the most complicated most advanced piece of machinery you own.

701
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:52,260
Rym: Well, in fact based on the demographic that I assume still listens to GeekNights based on interactions out there the one listener.

702
00:48:52,370 --> 00:49:01,598
Rym: Yeah If you respect heavily like the weird engineering that went into your computer and you don't think much about your car Your car is so much more complex than your fucking computer.

703
00:49:02,402 --> 00:49:05,012
Scott: Well, your car now has computers in it true these days.

704
00:49:05,052 --> 00:49:11,776
Rym: but computers because they're general purpose Like the substrate almost doesn't matter that much like it's so disentangled from what you use it for.

705
00:49:12,197 --> 00:49:25,000
Rym: but with a car All that stuff the computer does still has to translate to a whole bunch of high precision physical objects Interacting with each other in the real world and that is a messy difficult dangerous space.

706
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:31,700
Rym: That is so much more interesting and fascinating and important than the purely theoretical computation of a computer.

707
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:43,420
Scott: Yeah, I mean a CPU might be more complex in its arrangement than an automatic transmission But the automatic transmission gets it done with fluid under pressure as opposed to electrons, which is much harder to do.

708
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:50,786
Scott: Yep, at least for you know for someone like me who thinks in electrons the fluid seems hard In the meta moment.

709
00:49:50,806 --> 00:49:52,854
Rym: the geek knows book club book is still the tale of Genji.

710
00:49:52,974 --> 00:49:54,480
Rym: I am still continuing to read it.

711
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,067
Rym: I think September October.

712
00:49:56,087 --> 00:49:57,112
Rym: We're definitely doing this show.

713
00:49:57,192 --> 00:49:58,920
Scott: Maybe October you had it a month.

714
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:02,011
Rym: Well that so have you read any since the last time we talked?

715
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:04,180
Rym: no, okay, I had in a month October.

716
00:50:04,261 --> 00:50:04,888
Scott: I'm not gonna lie.

717
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:08,703
Rym: Yeah, I Still reading So I'm not good.

718
00:50:08,724 --> 00:50:11,836
Rym: So previously I kept saying Wow Genji really sleepwalks through life.

719
00:50:11,957 --> 00:50:14,122
Rym: I moved on to Genji there.

720
00:50:14,162 --> 00:50:16,711
Rym: There are more ghosts and ghost murders than I expected.

721
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:22,399
Rym: But now I just have one question Does Genji actually have a fucking job?

722
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,240
Scott: Does anyone in this entire at the part in the book where I am Genji like is it as a government, dude?

723
00:50:28,482 --> 00:50:29,332
Rym: Yeah, he is a government.

724
00:50:29,392 --> 00:50:29,716
Scott: He governs.

725
00:50:30,241 --> 00:50:35,980
Rym: So here's my question does any character at any point in this entire book?

726
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:45,212
Rym: Except for two characters who we hear have a conversation outside, uh Have a job that they actually do anything in?

727
00:50:45,232 --> 00:50:46,839
Scott: because yes, they do.

728
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:51,060
Scott: However, what's happening in this book is much like when you watch a movie?

729
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:58,060
Scott: Yeah, and you say hey doesn't anyone go to the fucking bathroom, you know It's like they'll show you someone going to the bathroom if it's meaningful like Jurassic Park.

730
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:02,880
Rym: Does she even keep going to school after like the sake you watch a rom-com?

731
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,768
Scott: There's no like just scenes of people going to the bathroom every day.

732
00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:12,600
Scott: and Genji is not about the work that people are doing But you know what these people who run the government are doing.

733
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:21,460
Scott: Yeah, it's about the the the drama the soap opera shit that's happening, you know On their spare time, but so here's that's all that you see.

734
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:28,680
Scott: You don't see them taking a shit and you don't see them, you know governing and meeting with Ambassador whatever the fuck you did with an imperial.

735
00:51:29,621 --> 00:51:42,699
Rym: what I do know about Han era Japan and like the kind of role Genji has is that at that level of government in that era a lot of roles were purely ceremonial and basically we're just a way to enrich that were that class of people.

736
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:46,810
Rym: Yeah, that's true because I just I think back to.

737
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:56,506
Rym: there was one conversation where you that remember when he was way early But I keep thinking back to it where he's having sex with some woman in But in like.

738
00:51:56,566 --> 00:51:58,980
Rym: she's staying in a poor part of town incognito.

739
00:51:59,501 --> 00:52:07,060
Rym: So he's with her in the poor part of town and there's some workmen like outside the house and they're talking and he's really mad.

740
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,288
Rym: Like I can hear these poor people talking.

741
00:52:09,348 --> 00:52:12,740
Rym: It's so weird and the woman's like, yeah, you gotta put up with the poor people talking.

742
00:52:12,822 --> 00:52:13,453
Rym: That's where I am.

743
00:52:14,021 --> 00:52:22,538
Rym: But the three lines of dialogue maybe four that those poor people have are the only naturalistic dialogue I've encountered in this entire book so far.

744
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:26,797
Rym: They have a normal conversation about normal things.

745
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:36,288
Scott: one of them Because when you're trying to woo someone you're using poetry that you wrote gave to your Servant who then gave it to the snuck it over to the other person because you know I can't go over there directly.

746
00:52:36,308 --> 00:52:37,999
Scott: You gotta talk to someone through a screen.

747
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:42,878
Rym: I'm also enjoying how Genji basically is better at poetry than everyone else.

748
00:52:42,918 --> 00:52:43,300
Rym: He knows.

749
00:52:44,021 --> 00:52:45,188
Scott: Well, that's basically the point.

750
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:45,651
Scott: Yep.

751
00:52:46,335 --> 00:52:47,859
Rym: So yeah, tell again She's pretty good.

752
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,460
Rym: But again my advice to you if you were gonna read it with us start now.

753
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:56,560
Rym: You'll probably finish it by the time we finish it, but do not fuss over the fiddly details.

754
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:59,595
Rym: Just let the story wash over you and just try to enjoy.

755
00:52:59,656 --> 00:53:01,668
Rym: read it for enjoyment Don't really take you.

756
00:53:01,769 --> 00:53:05,490
Scott: if you do if you try to read all the detail It'll take you longer to read than it's taken us.

757
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:09,630
Rym: Yep, and that said Otherwise our stuff's on the internet.

758
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,233
Rym: go find it.

759
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:11,559
Rym: Let's talk about deathmatch.

760
00:53:12,182 --> 00:53:17,020
Scott: Well some people I just want to say quickly some people have applied to our forum lately which still exists.

761
00:53:17,382 --> 00:53:20,519
Scott: You can come and talk to us in our forum or a discord for that matter.

762
00:53:21,942 --> 00:53:33,595
Scott: But people who've come to the forum when you apply to Register for the forum you have to type in a reason that you are coming and I've seen some people lately Type it in some reasons that are like hey, I want to make friends and talk about stuff.

763
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:36,112
Rym: Oh, don't tell that That's that's a bot.

764
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,040
Rym: you're a bot right?

765
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,013
Scott: That reason is too generic for me to believe that.

766
00:53:40,053 --> 00:53:41,360
Scott: that is a listener of the show.

767
00:53:41,461 --> 00:53:44,440
Scott: You if you want to I will like just accept you easily.

768
00:53:44,942 --> 00:53:49,020
Scott: You just have to write a reason that indicates that you are a GeekNights listener.

769
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:56,331
Scott: You could write something like I've been a GeekNights listener for two days and I heard this episode Clearly something that's clearly not a bot.

770
00:53:56,352 --> 00:53:57,276
Scott: It doesn't take much.

771
00:53:57,336 --> 00:53:57,818
Scott: It could be just.

772
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:02,153
Scott: you know Literally just like you know, I want to make fun of Scott clearly.

773
00:54:02,173 --> 00:54:03,780
Scott: That's not a bot if you wrote that right?

774
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,555
Scott: So it's like just something that I will read and say that's not a bot.

775
00:54:07,575 --> 00:54:08,399
Scott: That's a real listener.

776
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,995
Scott: Approved right, but if you say just I want to discuss things I want to learn something That's got I can't trust it.

777
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:16,440
Scott: That's human.

778
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:22,687
Rym: I feel like you're gonna what I feel like you're gonna want to discuss Bitcoin and you want to learn about how you can get Us to like Bitcoin.

779
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:26,449
Scott: So if you get rejected Don't dismay.

780
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,360
Scott: It's nothing personal.

781
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:31,099
Scott: Just try again and write a better reason in your reason box.

782
00:54:31,421 --> 00:54:36,958
Rym: Think of it as you have to pass a Turing test to get into the forum and we've set the bar a little higher than the average Turing test.

783
00:54:37,683 --> 00:54:40,736
Rym: Yeah, convince us in a couple sentences that you're probably human.

784
00:54:40,756 --> 00:54:41,480
Rym: That's all you got to do.

785
00:54:42,941 --> 00:54:44,489
Scott: They not need to dig less in a sentence.

786
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:51,180
Rym: Anyway, yeah, I mean I could imagine Very very short sentences that would convince me that you're cool to join.

787
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,811
Scott: If you wrote I am the listener that would get you in.

788
00:54:53,952 --> 00:54:55,920
Rym: that would literally get you in no question at like.

789
00:54:57,514 --> 00:54:57,780
Rym: You know what?

790
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:05,117
Rym: I will say if anyone applies to the forum and like Within a week of this episode and you just put in the letter a in lowercase.

791
00:55:05,277 --> 00:55:05,839
Rym: I would approve you.

792
00:55:07,602 --> 00:55:08,084
Rym: What are the odds?

793
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,270
Rym: that's what a bots gonna try.

794
00:55:09,813 --> 00:55:10,979
Scott: bots never gonna try the letter a.

795
00:55:12,362 --> 00:55:13,389
Rym: It's the best password.

796
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:13,953
Rym: What can I say so?

797
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,206
Rym: death matching was a like.

798
00:55:18,347 --> 00:55:27,056
Rym: the concept of a deathmatch game is Actually pretty new in terms of like gaming as a genre or something people would describe.

799
00:55:27,236 --> 00:55:28,640
Scott: It's about 20 something years old.

800
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,141
Scott: Yeah, I'd.

801
00:55:29,181 --> 00:55:34,415
Rym: so the games that did very similar things did exist for a long time in a lot of forms.

802
00:55:35,057 --> 00:55:44,584
Rym: I Argue that doom and quake were what made deathmatch with a capital D becomes something that people started to try to put Even one older than that.

803
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:51,310
Rym: I don't think there is one unless you start to use broader death definitions like some of those old networks.

804
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:57,840
Rym: PC games What are were arguably deathmatches but not not a here's person shooter deathmatch like we're talking.

805
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,231
Scott: Here's how what it has to be to be a deathmatch, right?

806
00:56:00,573 --> 00:56:02,060
Scott: It doesn't even have to be a first-person shooter.

807
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:05,804
Scott: It's a game in which there are several Characters each.

808
00:56:05,964 --> 00:56:07,107
Scott: each character is a player.

809
00:56:07,127 --> 00:56:11,840
Scott: All right, and you are thrown into the same arena as each other.

810
00:56:11,921 --> 00:56:14,016
Scott: It can't be one-on-one cuz that's just a fighting game.

811
00:56:14,258 --> 00:56:17,818
Scott: So I'm We're not done yet.

812
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:25,199
Scott: With what I've said so far, I guess a MOBA is still in the category But I'm gonna add more things to it to exclude MOBAs.

813
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:35,899
Scott: And once you're in this arena Everyone is on Generally equal footing to some degree in terms of you know what they do in the game, right?

814
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,087
Scott: But what the main your main goal is?

815
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:43,380
Scott: to kill the other players to destroy them in some way.

816
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:45,489
Scott: Everyone is on their own.

817
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:46,919
Scott: You're not on a team or anything.

818
00:56:47,706 --> 00:56:54,467
Scott: team deathmatch is a different thing and You kill people and when you kill them You get a point.

819
00:56:54,487 --> 00:56:56,015
Scott: you kill someone doesn't matter who it is.

820
00:56:56,035 --> 00:57:07,999
Scott: You get a point And you compete until either time runs out and you see who got the most kills or and you said a number of kills and whoever gets that number of kills first is the winner.

821
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:18,672
Scott: and There is respawning because obviously if you just died and didn't come back like counter-strike You would it would just be you know, last man standing.

822
00:57:18,712 --> 00:57:22,851
Rym: Yeah, that's a battle royale, which is a newer Genre that appeared.

823
00:57:22,952 --> 00:57:23,839
Rym: that is distinct exactly.

824
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:38,400
Scott: So there has to be some sort of respawning either quake where it's immediate you die and you're instantly brought back to life on the next frame or Timer like most other games these days where you die you wait a little bit and then you play again.

825
00:57:38,821 --> 00:57:43,360
Rym: So the term itself deathmatch was literally coined by John Romero.

826
00:57:46,302 --> 00:57:52,938
Rym: And the other thing that I remembered like I've ever vaguely knowing the history of FPS is but I was Thinking about this more in light of the show we were gonna do.

827
00:57:54,421 --> 00:58:09,459
Rym: According to people who worked at ID the idea for the deathmatch primarily came out of the team liked to play Japanese fighting games and trash-talk each other and then they started to wonder could we apply this to other games?

828
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,819
Rym: Could we get that same feeling in other games?

829
00:58:13,284 --> 00:58:20,899
Scott: It's also just you know Would you already have a game like doom or quake stood up as a single-player game and you've got the networking code in there to?

830
00:58:21,401 --> 00:58:23,825
Scott: allow Multiple people on the same map.

831
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:25,690
Scott: the deathmatch is like

832
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:26,332
Rym: you

833
00:58:26,532 --> 00:58:28,978
Scott: have to write almost no code because remember have that if

834
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:43,548
Rym: doom One was the first FPS for all intents and purposes like Wolfenstein is on the line because it's almost like it's on the edge where it's literally on the line between a maze game and a FPS because the the

835
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:43,969
Scott: the

836
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:47,020
Rym: shooting is the least interesting and important part of Wolfenstein.

837
00:58:47,881 --> 00:58:50,230
Rym: Wolfenstein 1 obviously, I'm not talking about recent 3d.

838
00:58:50,371 --> 00:58:51,516
Scott: Well Wolfenstein 3d.

839
00:58:51,616 --> 00:58:55,978
Rym: Yes, but doom Was a single-player game.

840
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:01,620
Rym: Vanishingly few people on earth had the ability to play that game multiplayer.

841
00:59:02,465 --> 00:59:04,840
Scott: So I had included right in the official thing.

842
00:59:04,984 --> 00:59:05,761
Scott: But yeah you can

843
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:20,960
Rym: plug some not plug a null modem in with your serial ports or be a wizard or have an IPX network or Something and you can play doom deathmatch and doom deathmatch What I find the most fascinating is that doom and quake one the first two real deathmatches.

844
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:25,234
Rym: We're just tacked on things that most of the player base will do to you also.

845
00:59:25,254 --> 00:59:28,688
Rym: Oh, yeah doom - Then quake - like that the whole span.

846
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:29,270
Rym: the final do.

847
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:29,753
Scott: final doom.

848
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:38,117
Rym: it was a tacked on mode that eventually small number of people could play a genre effectively invented from nothing.

849
00:59:38,919 --> 00:59:51,517
Rym: and yet the first ones are One hundred percent playable today and fun today And in many cases are better than deathmatch games that have come out recently.

850
00:59:51,858 --> 00:59:53,647
Rym: like well There's not much.

851
00:59:54,029 --> 00:59:57,108
Scott: there's not much you have to do To make it.

852
00:59:57,188 --> 00:59:58,880
Scott: it's not much you can do to make it better.

853
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:04,448
Rym: It's like a lot of the things that made it better Arguably also made them more fiddly.

854
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:16,094
Rym: like we were playing quake one a bunch lately and last night We're playing with some friends and we all agreed that it was almost refreshing To play a deathmatch first-person shooter where there's no reloading.

855
01:00:16,396 --> 01:00:19,730
Rym: There's no waiting to respawn There's no rules about being spiked.

856
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:20,976
Rym: the game just fucking goes.

857
01:00:21,056 --> 01:00:21,840
Scott: pop up up go go go.

858
01:00:22,181 --> 01:00:28,360
Rym: Well, like it was a lot of those said it was almost less mental effort to play despite being just as difficult.

859
01:00:29,122 --> 01:00:43,985
Scott: Well that has less to do with deathmatch itself than just with the fact that newer FPS's have made a lot of those changes and add a lot of those things from quake for various reasons of their own Right, you know because they're.

860
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:46,933
Scott: you know, single-player games are trying to be easier.

861
01:00:46,953 --> 01:00:49,380
Scott: their main modes are something else, right?

862
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:56,980
Scott: But as a result the it's just a side effect that the deathmatch mode Suffers from those things, right?

863
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,163
Scott: It's like you're trying to make half-life.

864
01:00:58,524 --> 01:01:03,580
Scott: half-life was optimized for the single-player adventure play, you know mode, right?

865
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,747
Scott: That's it's a. there is half-life deathmatch.

866
01:01:05,947 --> 01:01:15,820
Scott: It's kind of meh, right because the changes they made to half-life Yeah, I'll make it good at being a single-player story game make it not a great death.

867
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,820
Scott: It's not a bad deathmatch game, but it's not great.

868
01:01:19,562 --> 01:01:23,655
Rym: You know a case in point a friend of ours quake 3 is nothing but deathmatch.

869
01:01:23,716 --> 01:01:26,728
Scott: quake 3 doesn't even have Friggin single-player.

870
01:01:26,748 --> 01:01:28,436
Scott: It was just multiplayer.

871
01:01:28,456 --> 01:01:31,580
Rym: So a friend of ours Let's just call him George, but he's just a friend of ours.

872
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:32,163
Rym: We were playing.

873
01:01:32,384 --> 01:01:33,750
Rym: he'd never played quake 1 before.

874
01:01:34,614 --> 01:01:35,699
Rym: so we got together last night.

875
01:01:36,121 --> 01:01:42,199
Rym: We played quake 1 deathmatch and not only did he do fine after the first couple rounds, but he had fun.

876
01:01:42,903 --> 01:01:44,819
Rym: They yeah, how many games?

877
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,558
Rym: unchanged from their original release.

878
01:01:48,183 --> 01:01:55,775
Rym: Decades in the past hold up Among contemporary games out of the box for someone who has zero nostalgia for them.

879
01:01:56,376 --> 01:01:57,520
Scott: That is a short list.

880
01:01:58,702 --> 01:02:01,060
Scott: It's like it's just like a backgammon or a chess.

881
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:04,472
Scott: I don't need to do it and doom one.

882
01:02:04,532 --> 01:02:06,660
Rym: deathmatch are all our timeless games.

883
01:02:07,142 --> 01:02:10,620
Rym: They happen to also be genre defining like firsts.

884
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:16,004
Scott: And if you try to gussy it up, right if you try to take backgammon and gussy it up It's like you're.

885
01:02:16,185 --> 01:02:17,051
Scott: you can't make it better.

886
01:02:17,454 --> 01:02:18,420
Rym: backgammon legacy.

887
01:02:19,442 --> 01:02:19,966
Scott: Yeah, it's like you.

888
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,214
Scott: there's nothing you can do to it.

889
01:02:21,395 --> 01:02:22,160
Rym: I dropped already.

890
01:02:22,482 --> 01:02:25,196
Rym: I dropped a nuke on the fourth chevron on black side.

891
01:02:25,236 --> 01:02:25,980
Rym: wait till the next game.

892
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:30,960
Scott: We'll see how that affects everything you look at like a modern FPS where there's all these different classes and things like that.

893
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,852
Rym: Oh, yeah, watch has a deathmatch mode.

894
01:02:32,893 --> 01:02:33,597
Rym: It's not that fun.

895
01:02:34,462 --> 01:02:46,420
Scott: Yeah, all the classes and things are great for the modes that they're meant for right where you you know You're doing some sort of competing over, you know points on the map or something on teams

896
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:54,219
Rym: Team deathmatches, which I would argue are literally a completely separate genre from deathmatches.

897
01:02:55,123 --> 01:03:00,189
Rym: That is a controversial and statement that we could debate like I. Obviously no team.

898
01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:02,200
Scott: I agree team deathmatch is a completely different game.

899
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:08,803
Scott: It's like I'm like almost you know, I'm saying I can only changing one rule but in that one rule change you've changed everything because.

900
01:03:09,143 --> 01:03:16,913
Rym: but team deathmatch in overwatch because the classes is More fun than team deathmatch in like a quake one because the class is like.

901
01:03:16,933 --> 01:03:19,280
Rym: there's a whole different dimension to team dynamics.

902
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:23,600
Rym: It's more like professional sports like football, but I digress with deathmatch.

903
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:33,008
Rym: I think a very important element is that they are stateless and that every player has the exact same Capabilities much like a fighting game.

904
01:03:33,329 --> 01:03:35,035
Rym: You can all choose any fighter.

905
01:03:35,055 --> 01:03:37,669
Rym: if I if you choose Ryu I can also choose Ryu.

906
01:03:37,971 --> 01:03:43,339
Rym: The game is a pure unadulterated test of your skill at this specific game.

907
01:03:44,422 --> 01:03:49,859
Scott: Well, there there is one not thing in deathmatch That is not a test of your skill.

908
01:03:50,081 --> 01:03:50,845
Scott: Which is that?

909
01:03:50,946 --> 01:03:53,480
Scott: because it's every man for them every person for themselves.

910
01:03:54,322 --> 01:03:56,468
Scott: There is an element of politics in the death.

911
01:03:56,528 --> 01:03:57,350
Rym: mother is.

912
01:03:57,932 --> 01:04:01,040
Scott: however, there is some sort of coordination amongst the players.

913
01:04:01,602 --> 01:04:05,895
Scott: You can gang up on someone and on to intentionally I would argue.

914
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,079
Rym: and well that is true.

915
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:12,413
Rym: in Practice these games tend to be so fast and so skill based.

916
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,476
Rym: well that huh?

917
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:24,800
Rym: Well, we'll get to that Someone who is skilled enough to be able to engage with politics is skilled enough to win anyway and even in the lack of communication.

918
01:04:25,322 --> 01:04:32,850
Rym: The pattern of almost all deathmatch games is that the skill is not killing people while not being killed You actually you want to die.

919
01:04:32,931 --> 01:04:34,339
Rym: actually dying is fine, too.

920
01:04:34,841 --> 01:04:35,001
Scott: You.

921
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:42,960
Rym: sometimes you're going for a high rate of kills because the only thing that's ranking you is how many kills you've gotten.

922
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:52,180
Rym: If you kill ten people and then die That is way better than killing five people with never dying or one person and never dying or two people very slowly and never dying.

923
01:04:53,381 --> 01:04:57,735
Rym: You want to so you want to kill as fast as possible and you want to optimize toward killing.

924
01:04:58,156 --> 01:05:07,845
Rym: if you're losing a fight You're better off just getting killed especially if the person you're fighting with is not beating you to give that frag to someone who can't beat you and then Responding somewhere else and trying again.

925
01:05:07,865 --> 01:05:23,560
Rym: It's almost like a reset but - yep in that situation The primary skill to be good at deathmatches when there's a disparate set of players is Note who is bad at the game like Oh blue is bad and target that follow them around.

926
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,588
Rym: Just milk them for kills over and over and over again.

927
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:27,135
Rym: That is how you win deathmatches.

928
01:05:27,396 --> 01:05:31,914
Rym: if you see two people fighting Hang back and just spam them from a distance.

929
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:32,920
Rym: Maybe you'll get them both.

930
01:05:33,301 --> 01:05:34,806
Rym: Let someone else do the hard work.

931
01:05:34,866 --> 01:05:40,987
Rym: kill stealing is a primary component and skill of deathmatches Mm-hmm.

932
01:05:41,067 --> 01:05:50,052
Scott: So the thing is all those things we just talked about Right those things align better with the old FPS is than the new one.

933
01:05:50,132 --> 01:05:51,239
Rym: Oh my god, quick one.

934
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,443
Scott: We talked we take it.

935
01:05:52,824 --> 01:06:02,184
Scott: quake one is so fast right that even if you try the politics, it's too fast Strike speed.

936
01:06:02,505 --> 01:06:05,234
Rym: I tried to play counter-strike after playing quake one again a couple.

937
01:06:05,255 --> 01:06:07,442
Rym: we like oh, it's like molasses like Like.

938
01:06:07,542 --> 01:06:08,867
Rym: I felt like my game was broken.

939
01:06:08,907 --> 01:06:09,790
Rym: I was moving so slow.

940
01:06:10,412 --> 01:06:15,329
Scott: right if you play counter-strike deathmatch somehow It's like it's so slow.

941
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:17,478
Scott: politics have time to enter into the game.

942
01:06:17,518 --> 01:06:18,743
Scott: Yeah Yeah, there's not.

943
01:06:18,783 --> 01:06:21,275
Scott: the skilled cap is still pretty high in counter-strike.

944
01:06:21,315 --> 01:06:22,380
Scott: is it gonna click on heads there?

945
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,188
Scott: Yeah, but it's still.

946
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:26,096
Scott: it's still lower than quake.

947
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:28,430
Scott: So You know, you're gonna have.

948
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:31,984
Scott: you're not gonna Have that situation right.

949
01:06:32,025 --> 01:06:41,877
Scott: suddenly, you know ganging up on someone can counter someone with a lot of counter-strike skill Whereas in quake if someone's really good and ganging up on them isn't gonna help you.

950
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:43,759
Scott: They're too good Yeah, they're just gonna kill you.

951
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:44,161
Scott: Anyway,

952
01:06:44,181 --> 01:07:08,600
Rym: yeah, if for bad four of weak FPS players getting up on one strong quake player the strong one will just get four kills Exactly, but what is interesting is I've seen this trend with quake and doom over the years that like I and it also Was true the few times we've played the new quake recently among our friends Is that up to a certain limit even if there's a big disparity in skill?

953
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:14,540
Rym: Everyone can still have fun because you're all fighting and killing and when you die your respawn instantly.

954
01:07:14,962 --> 01:07:19,819
Rym: But then the better players just get more kills during that time, but you're still playing.

955
01:07:20,564 --> 01:07:24,143
Scott: Yeah, so the reason so that's the thing is you Encounter strike.

956
01:07:24,163 --> 01:07:36,320
Scott: when you die you're out right or if there's a respawn time where you're out So suck those games, you know a lot of games these days punish you for being bad at it by making it less fun.

957
01:07:36,421 --> 01:07:39,685
Scott: It's like you literally lose fun If you suck.

958
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:45,780
Scott: if you play quake deathmatch, you might get no kills And that's obviously less fun than killing all kinds of people.

959
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,243
Rym: But you're still running around shooting rockets jumping.

960
01:07:48,303 --> 01:07:53,049
Scott: you are non-stop running around shooting rockets for every literally you do.

961
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:57,910
Scott: there is Zero respawn time where you are dead and on the next frame you are alive.

962
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:01,561
Scott: So just you are non-stop playing the entire time.

963
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:02,965
Scott: you're moving fast.

964
01:08:03,266 --> 01:08:04,450
Scott: You're exploring the map.

965
01:08:04,851 --> 01:08:07,819
Scott: Hopefully the maps are interesting and are fun to interact with.

966
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,770
Scott: and even if you don't kill anyone ever you're still shooting people.

967
01:08:11,971 --> 01:08:14,301
Scott: There's just guns lying around everywhere.

968
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:15,546
Scott: It's not like I'm not good enough.

969
01:08:15,586 --> 01:08:16,510
Scott: I couldn't get the good gun.

970
01:08:16,611 --> 01:08:17,599
Scott: It's like no, it's just sitting there.

971
01:08:17,618 --> 01:08:21,622
Scott: You picked it up Shoot rockets and lightning and never you're gonna get to.

972
01:08:21,965 --> 01:08:23,090
Scott: and great fun stuff.

973
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:25,300
Rym: I die a lot, but I still get to shoot.

974
01:08:25,321 --> 01:08:27,169
Rym: that lightning got a whole bunch before I die.

975
01:08:27,993 --> 01:08:29,781
Scott: Yeah, and sometimes dying is fun.

976
01:08:29,801 --> 01:08:31,026
Scott: You thought you're in the water.

977
01:08:31,046 --> 01:08:31,870
Scott: You shoot the lightning gun.

978
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:33,578
Scott: You kill everyone else in the water and yourself.

979
01:08:33,658 --> 01:08:33,899
Scott: Oops.

980
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:34,362
Rym: Yep.

981
01:08:34,684 --> 01:08:37,115
Scott: I electrified the water my V I remember way back.

982
01:08:37,175 --> 01:08:45,073
Rym: I said up to a point because when I was in high school I played a lot of out cuz what I had cable modems very early like 1997.

983
01:08:45,073 --> 01:08:47,122
Rym: So I was playing online.

984
01:08:47,283 --> 01:08:48,410
Rym: FES is all lots.

985
01:08:48,971 --> 01:08:55,750
Rym: But I had friends who were serious enough about it to be semi-professional And a couple of them were like they played in leagues.

986
01:08:56,051 --> 01:09:09,729
Rym: they played for real like they played real tournaments like they were serious players and I play with them casually like I wasn't as good or into it as they were but Occasionally and this is mostly they play mods like mega TF or weapons factory or whatever.

987
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:17,743
Rym: But occasionally I would try to play just deathmatch with them Couldn't move I would die instantly no matter what.

988
01:09:18,004 --> 01:09:23,209
Rym: there I couldn't have any fun I could not even shoot before I was instantly dead all the time.

989
01:09:23,834 --> 01:09:26,858
Scott: No, I guess you must be playing on a tiny map But the map is big enough.

990
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:28,430
Rym: or a big map full set of players.

991
01:09:29,113 --> 01:09:33,270
Scott: You should be able to spawn occasionally when no one else is in the in that room.

992
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:37,624
Scott: You spawned in just like randomness and survive at least until someone shows up.

993
01:09:38,326 --> 01:09:46,854
Rym: So here's a question for you Would you consider a quake map that was designed to be a one-on-one in a small room Deathmatch or not?

994
01:09:47,335 --> 01:09:50,586
Rym: if it was all the same rules same same thing, but it's only one-on-one.

995
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:53,598
Rym: I Mean because that's basically just a fighting.

996
01:09:53,638 --> 01:09:56,130
Scott: Are you respawning instantly respawn instantly?

997
01:09:56,570 --> 01:10:00,025
Scott: It's just a big big room and it's who gets the most and who gets the most kills.

998
01:10:00,045 --> 01:10:01,230
Rym: exact same quake one.

999
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:04,690
Rym: We played except the player limit is two and the room is small, right?

1000
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:09,030
Scott: I think with the small room are there weapons and health and stuff in the weapons now just lying around?

1001
01:10:09,758 --> 01:10:10,649
Scott: Yeah, see I think so.

1002
01:10:11,002 --> 01:10:12,995
Scott: I mean I guess it still is a deathmatch.

1003
01:10:13,316 --> 01:10:22,748
Scott: the problem is it might end up being a tilted one because whoever gets that first kill Right can now pick up all the right even though the other person is gonna respawn instantly.

1004
01:10:25,494 --> 01:10:27,730
Scott: They had does that no matter how good you are?

1005
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:31,509
Scott: There's that fraction of a second where you have to reorient your brain, right?

1006
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:38,550
Scott: Yep I have a person how and the other person is still in the room and they know where the spawn points are.

1007
01:10:39,014 --> 01:10:41,253
Scott: you know presumably so.

1008
01:10:41,494 --> 01:10:50,544
Scott: there will be a rocket coming at you as you're spawning if they're any good and You will spawn and probably immediately get hit by the rocket.

1009
01:10:50,644 --> 01:10:52,470
Scott: Even if you're holding W as you spawn.

1010
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:57,525
Rym: So the solution to that, but I would argue this is not a deathmatch.

1011
01:10:57,565 --> 01:10:58,709
Rym: This is something different.

1012
01:10:59,371 --> 01:11:02,282
Rym: But there was a mo a mod in quake one that I've really liked.

1013
01:11:02,543 --> 01:11:07,785
Rym: that set up an arena where two players Would be in a room with every weapon or whatever the setup was.

1014
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:08,990
Rym: you both agreed on there.

1015
01:11:09,051 --> 01:11:13,236
Rym: it's a perfectly symmetrical small map and The doors would open.

1016
01:11:13,518 --> 01:11:14,343
Rym: you both run out.

1017
01:11:14,363 --> 01:11:20,310
Rym: you fight till one person dies Then you both are back in those rooms the doors come up you run out you fight till one person dies.

1018
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:21,756
Scott: Yeah, that's not a death man.

1019
01:11:21,796 --> 01:11:22,881
Scott: Oh, but that's a fun game.

1020
01:11:22,941 --> 01:11:33,124
Rym: That was a real fun game and Overwatch is deathmatch modes are not nearly as fun as they have a mode where you're both set as the same character whether you like It or not and just whoever kills the other one first.

1021
01:11:33,587 --> 01:11:35,807
Rym: That's it hmm.

1022
01:11:36,971 --> 01:11:49,910
Rym: But I just I think that that first mode in quake one was interesting especially considering that id Developed the deathmatch rules based on the feelings they got playing games like Street Fighter 2 trash-talking each other while they played.

1023
01:11:50,752 --> 01:11:52,298
Scott: Yeah, you they they.

1024
01:11:52,699 --> 01:11:55,990
Scott: I think it's really just the the mode that comes automatically.

1025
01:11:56,151 --> 01:11:56,933
Scott: It's like okay.

1026
01:11:57,114 --> 01:11:57,696
Scott: You know we're here.

1027
01:11:57,716 --> 01:11:59,201
Scott: We are playing this FPS.

1028
01:11:59,241 --> 01:11:59,923
Scott: It's an FPS.

1029
01:12:00,385 --> 01:12:01,890
Scott: We made a map all right.

1030
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:03,314
Scott: now There's two people in the map.

1031
01:12:03,937 --> 01:12:04,378
Scott: yeah, all right.

1032
01:12:04,398 --> 01:12:06,264
Scott: well obviously it's a game about killing things.

1033
01:12:06,425 --> 01:12:13,015
Scott: so and now we're gonna kill each other Instead of killing AI and that gets so much more interesting cuz you can't People the most wins.

1034
01:12:13,136 --> 01:12:14,921
Scott: it's like the first did nothing.

1035
01:12:14,941 --> 01:12:16,747
Scott: You know you know game design whatsoever.

1036
01:12:16,807 --> 01:12:17,229
Scott: Just do it.

1037
01:12:17,349 --> 01:12:22,667
Scott: Yeah I do also think that one way you can mess up a deathmatch.

1038
01:12:22,747 --> 01:12:24,473
Scott: I think is You.

1039
01:12:24,654 --> 01:12:29,638
Scott: you have to have maps that are Designed to make the deathmatch good.

1040
01:12:29,698 --> 01:12:35,335
Scott: if you have a bad map it can sort of ruin the whole thing even with the exact Same rules and the exact same game.

1041
01:12:35,616 --> 01:12:39,930
Rym: exactly I would say that sometimes deathmatch is powerful enough to survive a bad map.

1042
01:12:40,371 --> 01:12:44,590
Scott: But so yeah, it can survive a bad map, but definitely some maps are much better than others.

1043
01:12:45,192 --> 01:12:46,356
Rym: Oh, what was that crazy one?

1044
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:49,668
Rym: We played last night the weird multi-layer angle thing that was an A+ map.

1045
01:12:50,853 --> 01:12:51,978
Scott: Oh, you're the one that was like ricochet.

1046
01:12:52,038 --> 01:13:01,210
Scott: Yeah, yeah the outer space one with the teleporters Plus chef kiss do whoever designed that map you you should get a map design prize of some kind.

1047
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:07,929
Scott: But yeah, you know there's some maps that are just really good because they'll be I think the ideal map right.

1048
01:13:07,949 --> 01:13:10,076
Scott: you got to have Enough space for the number of players.

1049
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:15,415
Scott: if there's too many players in a small space it too much if there's not enough players in The big space is too boring.

1050
01:13:15,555 --> 01:13:15,716
Rym: Yep.

1051
01:13:16,318 --> 01:13:21,677
Rym: You got to have the right balance of different interesting Situational weapons like.

1052
01:13:21,718 --> 01:13:29,450
Rym: you can't have weapons that mostly do the same thing Unless you're making a deathmatch where everyone has just like a pistol and it's really simplistic and minimalist.

1053
01:13:30,351 --> 01:13:37,159
Scott: You want to have some areas that are really claustrophobic and contained hallways nooks and crannies So you can get stuck in there with someone.

1054
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:39,270
Scott: but you also want to have your big wide open areas.

1055
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:41,784
Scott: You can rocket jump and you know snipe people and also

1056
01:13:41,824 --> 01:13:53,350
Rym: so you can have dynamics Like if you encounter someone who appears to be strong in an area where you're not good at that kind of fighting You can try to bait them into following you into a place where you have the high ground like that.

1057
01:13:54,311 --> 01:14:01,580
Scott: Or if you spawn your particular weapon like, you know, maybe a grenade launcher is good in hallways Right, then you stick to the hallways.

1058
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,690
Scott: You don't go to the big open area with the grenade launcher.

1059
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:05,077
Scott: Oh now I've got the rocket launcher.

1060
01:14:05,097 --> 01:14:05,177
Scott: Now.

1061
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:06,665
Scott: I'll go to the big open area.

1062
01:14:06,705 --> 01:14:07,750
Scott: See if I can get somebody.

1063
01:14:07,991 --> 01:14:09,679
Rym: I like maps that have a game as a.

1064
01:14:09,819 --> 01:14:12,050
Scott: if the game is a railgun go to the big open area.

1065
01:14:14,352 --> 01:14:20,817
Rym: At least one gimmick like the lava pit that you can hit the button and it just opens like I like it there being a Of some kind because it's always

1066
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:28,461
Scott: really good because they force players to move, you know and usually what you're gonna be doing in a deathmatch is You know, there'll be some sort of route.

1067
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:29,670
Scott: you have to go around the map.

1068
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,433
Scott: They're always moving.

1069
01:14:30,473 --> 01:14:31,597
Scott: if you sit still you're gonna die.

1070
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:31,978
Scott: Yep.

1071
01:14:32,018 --> 01:14:35,410
Scott: So you got to be moving to either find or run away from players.

1072
01:14:35,794 --> 01:14:37,030
Rym: So you have a row is moving.

1073
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,817
Rym: I used to call it the loop and yours do.

1074
01:14:38,857 --> 01:14:44,117
Scott: your loop is gonna be including health armor weapons Ammo right to keep yourself stocked up.

1075
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:47,730
Scott: you encounter people you kill them and you keep going on your your route.

1076
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:52,550
Scott: You might change your route based on certain situations, but you know, you're moving around all the time.

1077
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:58,030
Scott: You need features in the map that cause players to change up their movement.

1078
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:00,638
Scott: Yes, right like like ah, there's a quick debt.

1079
01:15:00,678 --> 01:15:04,790
Scott: The quad damage appears at these intervals in this particular spot.

1080
01:15:05,452 --> 01:15:10,569
Scott: Push a button and go up an elevator to get there, but it's so worth getting it.

1081
01:15:11,071 --> 01:15:15,290
Scott: So once in a while your people are gonna group up at this spot to try to get this

1082
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:22,809
Rym: Or you're gonna group up away from the spot with a rocket launcher wait for all the all the noobs to group up and get a whole bunch of kills

1083
01:15:23,611 --> 01:15:25,737
Scott: Except the noob with the quad damage is gonna come.

1084
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:28,244
Rym: Yeah, you can't let him actually get that quad damage.

1085
01:15:28,264 --> 01:15:28,926
Rym: That's the problem.

1086
01:15:29,668 --> 01:15:34,041
Scott: Yeah You know, so that's that's how it's got to do.

1087
01:15:34,141 --> 01:15:36,309
Rym: Yeah, but I think deathmatch is.

1088
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:46,570
Rym: I think there's still a lot more space to explore in deathmatch and I wonder if Quake 1 and then if they follow on and do quake 2 and more deathmatch is not dead like it is popular.

1089
01:15:46,671 --> 01:15:48,770
Rym: It's just not talked about as much in a lot of gaming circles.

1090
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:52,663
Rym: But deathmatch is more popular than a lot of games that you and I play.

1091
01:15:52,683 --> 01:15:54,890
Scott: and I think the the deathmatch.

1092
01:15:54,930 --> 01:16:03,430
Scott: You know, the deathmatch doesn't have to be a first-person shooter No, but I don't think it has been applied enough to non first-person shooter games.

1093
01:16:04,258 --> 01:16:06,475
Scott: so You know, it's like why?

1094
01:16:06,575 --> 01:16:10,230
Scott: why you know Smash Brothers is you know has the stock mode and the time?

1095
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:11,335
Rym: Yeah, you do respond.

1096
01:16:11,436 --> 01:16:11,999
Scott: It's like.

1097
01:16:12,763 --> 01:16:18,730
Scott: it's sort of like a deathmatch But you have to really take a lot of health from someone to kill them in Smash Brothers.

1098
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:22,489
Scott: Alright, you know, otherwise it sort of is a deathmatch.

1099
01:16:23,451 --> 01:16:30,790
Scott: But the fact that people have so much health like even just from spawning, you know You end up having this gameplay of grinding people down.

1100
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:32,798
Scott: Imagine if you played smash we're just like.

1101
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:35,690
Scott: I guess you can just do this in smash with the rules.

1102
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:37,677
Scott: You know settings they let you have.

1103
01:16:38,018 --> 01:16:41,130
Scott: just make everything a one-hit-kill all the time and give everyone stop.

1104
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:45,205
Rym: I mean, that's how quick three deathmatch just was effectively because it was literally just.

1105
01:16:45,626 --> 01:16:49,390
Rym: everyone has a rail gun Everyone is one shot killing because everyone gets headshots.

1106
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:58,439
Scott: Yep, if you I guess if you took Smash Brothers and put it on like almost no health 30 stock One hit kill or even table time.

1107
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,770
Rym: Remember we played that board game so many years ago at a PAX.

1108
01:17:00,911 --> 01:17:07,740
Rym: it was basically just like a quick three deathmatch and It actually shockingly really Recreated the feeling of playing it.

1109
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:13,842
Rym: Yeah, but it was a little slow and you Yeah, obviously there were problems with it, but you could have tabletop deathmatches.

1110
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:16,570
Rym: You could have top-down tap deathmatches turn-based deathmatches.

1111
01:17:19,112 --> 01:17:25,531
Scott: But yeah, it's like, you know, we people worry about player elimination, you know in games it's like, you know, it's like oh, yeah it's like.

1112
01:17:25,812 --> 01:17:32,905
Scott: well another solution for player elimination besides making it welcome is Just have people immediately respond.

1113
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:37,416
Scott: all the time The train train deathmatch.

1114
01:17:37,477 --> 01:17:44,567
Scott: it's like run a train company as soon as it's bankrupt you get a brand new train company Who eliminated who eliminated the most train company.

1115
01:17:44,607 --> 01:17:45,070
Scott: your score?

1116
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:49,689
Rym: Your score at the end is how many bankruptcies did you cause - how many did you did happen to you?

1117
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:51,734
Scott: Yeah, exactly, right.

1118
01:17:52,055 --> 01:17:56,930
Scott: That's a crab bucket and you just you everyone you spawn you take a bunch of loans, right?

1119
01:17:57,135 --> 01:18:05,778
Rym: This Has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1131
01:19:33,691 --> 01:19:35,256
Scott: Now that was a real game.

1132
01:19:35,516 --> 01:19:36,760
Rym: all you needed was a 486 and a 9600 bald modem.

1133
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,502
Rym: those were the days.

1134

1136
01:19:53,436 --> 01:19:55,210
Rym: At least his little brother likes to play outside.
