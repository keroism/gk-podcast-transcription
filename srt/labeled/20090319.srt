1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,985
Rym: It's Thursday March 19th.

2
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:12,249
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:15,340
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight baseball.

4
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:26,916
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:36,223
Scott: So Remember that that photoshop the Zelda.

6
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:36,987
Rym: Oh my God.

7
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:40,059
Scott: Yes That's all but never someone decides of March.

8
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:40,320
Scott: It's like.

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,690
Scott: I don't think about like it to brutal.

10
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,790
Scott: I always think about that Zelda Photoshop.

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:52,410
Rym: but We're around that time that time of betrayal and I think the hail and hardy in Grand central betrayed me.

12
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,157
Rym: I eat their kind off.

13
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:56,347
Scott: It's a chain, but it makes you know soups.

14
00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:57,070
Scott: It's good for lunch.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,882
Rym: Yeah, I like soup, and I was hungry, and I wanted some dinner.

16
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:00,906
Scott: There's one closer to me.

17
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,361
Rym: before I came home There's two chipotals near me.

18
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:04,510
Scott: I know there's two chipotals.

19
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:06,159
Scott: I actually have two chipotals near me.

20
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:13,128
Rym: The thing is the new one they opened up never has a line But everyone goes to Pinche instead because Pinche is like the new hotness Pinche taqueria.

21
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:20,987
Rym: But I think I was betrayed because I got some jambalaya and I've been Bali since then.

22
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:25,109
Scott: well Jambalaya from anywhere even the best jambalaya can make you badly.

23
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:26,196
Scott: It's that kind of.

24
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:28,470
Scott: it's the spicy kind of greasy food.

25
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,513
Rym: It's not that spicy.

26
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:32,581
Rym: one spicy greasy food does not make me badly.

27
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:34,586
Rym: I eat spicy greasy food every day.

28
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:37,849
Scott: Yeah Speaking of bali nous, right?

29
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:39,454
Scott: Was it yesterday?

30
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:43,365
Scott: yesterday right I wanted like a hamburger for lunch right?

31
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,109
Scott: so the Sparky's place.

32
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,150
Scott: remember I took you there once gone right Pinche is in there now, so I can't can't go there, right?

33
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,309
Rym: There's no good burger anywhere near you.

34
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:58,950
Scott: I could go down to the deli like down on Spring Street, but that place started carrying Randy medicine.

35
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,657
Scott: So I won't go there anymore right?

36
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:03,086
Scott: so where am I supposed to go?

37
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:04,030
Scott: so I go to you know?

38
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:09,949
Scott: Little Google on my phone, and I type in burger all right, and there's five guys a little bit away.

39
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:12,458
Scott: So I'm like aha five guys is good people.

40
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,315
Scott: people always people are always talking it up big-time like oh It's like the great place to go.

41
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:21,852
Scott: It's like the best burger short of your backyard, and oh it's even though It's a chain.

42
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,339
Scott: It's like the best chain burger right.

43
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,082
Rym: I don't know.

44
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:25,970
Rym: I think good burger gives it a run for its money.

45
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:31,564
Scott: Well anyway the point is is that you know I'm like all right I'll go try this place that everyone keeps talking up so much.

46
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,750
Rym: this end in bowling.

47
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:37,358
Scott: It doesn't end big bad But it ends in some balliness right.

48
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:42,636
Scott: so I got I do the five guys a little bit of a walk But you know it's a. it's a walk.

49
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:44,723
Scott: It's it's an okay walk for a lunch right?

50
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:44,984
Scott: not.

51
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,450
Scott: It's not anything serious.

52
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,906
Scott: It's like oh my it's like an extra block farther than the deli.

53
00:02:48,926 --> 00:02:54,733
Scott: all right I go over there, and I go in and I'm just like yeah I want like a burger.

54
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:57,001
Scott: you know lettuce tomato onion and fries.

55
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:57,884
Scott: right and they got.

56
00:02:57,984 --> 00:02:59,710
Scott: I got some cajun fries.

57
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,422
Scott: They're actually nice and spicy.

58
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:04,416
Scott: they taste a lot like Arby's curly fries.

59
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:07,050
Scott: only they were only they were better potato.

60
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:10,695
Scott: They actually had sacks of like Idaho potatoes there And they're like today's.

61
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:13,730
Scott: potatoes come from and they named the town in Idaho.

62
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:17,310
Scott: But then I look at the actual bags that are sitting on the floor there.

63
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,988
Scott: They have a different town in Idaho written on them, huh?

64
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:32,927
Scott: Who's very strange, but they were real Idaho potatoes and the french fries are but they're no Rasta fries No, they're very potato II and they had some nice little spice like the Arby's curly fries and they're very tasty and they gave me a lot of them.

65
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:36,990
Rym: and So you remember those Rasta fries right and everything on the menu?

66
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,650
Scott: Oh, yeah, they're great and everything on the menu is trans fat free, so I was like ah very good french fry.

67
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,496
Scott: Okay, right.

68
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:44,630
Scott: They also have a buckets of peanuts.

69
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,318
Scott: You can just shovel them and eat as many as you want.

70
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:49,110
Scott: I did not eat any right, so I took it back.

71
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:57,703
Scott: You know I got the burger which is wrapped up so I didn't see it until I brought it back to the office and opened it up and It was a double burger.

72
00:03:58,046 --> 00:04:03,790
Scott: Oh, man Apparently I was wondering why it cost $10 for a burger and fries.

73
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:07,004
Scott: The default at five guys is a double burger.

74
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,009
Scott: I was not aware of this.

75
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,518
Scott: I'm usually you know I don't I don't eat.

76
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:20,910
Scott: You know I understand why some people go all man two meats Yes, and I can respect that but personally one meat is enough for me.

77
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,670
Rym: Well that is you know you don't move around a lot.

78
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,980
Rym: So if you eat two meats that extra meats really just.

79
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:28,190
Scott: well the thing is it's like I can eat.

80
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:39,570
Scott: You know two single hamburgers right, but then I'm also eating two buns two lettuces two tomatoes Right and two onion, but if I get one burger one.

81
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:48,130
Scott: But you know one bun one lettuce one tomato one onion with two meats That's you know a lot of meats and it they had all the calories on the menu, too.

82
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,082
Scott: I think it was like six hundred and seven hundred calories or something like that.

83
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:52,830
Scott: right and that didn't count the fries.

84
00:04:53,818 --> 00:04:54,250
Scott: But anyway.

85
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,970
Scott: So I'm like oh whatever you know the burger.

86
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,584
Scott: You know the patties though were not big fat patties like we have in our backyard.

87
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:01,387
Scott: right they were sort of.

88
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:05,603
Scott: they were thinner And you know they was okay wasn't like the bay wasn't like.

89
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:10,561
Scott: you know fud records of the backyard But you know I could see why people approve of it so much.

90
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:13,613
Scott: It was you know it was not some nasty McDonald's burger That's for sure.

91
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:14,900
Scott: So yeah, it was real meat.

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,684
Rym: ate the whole thing.

93
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:16,689
Scott: I ate it of course.

94
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,065
Scott: yes I ate all the fries and they had actual Heinz ketchup packets.

95
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:20,769
Scott: It was very nice.

96
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:26,410
Scott: and Then of course I was a little bit Bali for a little while there.

97
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:28,499
Scott: Next time I go back.

98
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,284
Scott: I'm gonna order.

99
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:30,130
Scott: I looked at the menu.

100
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:42,264
Scott: They have a little burger which I assume he called little but really it just means normal one patty burger And it was like five bucks instead of ten bucks, so I think that is what I'll be ordering the next time.

101
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:42,945
Scott: I'm over there.

102
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:45,835
Scott: I Was because they didn't let me.

103
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:46,176
Scott: they didn't.

104
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:49,130
Scott: I didn't know it was a double to order a normal hamburger.

105
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:50,376
Scott: It didn't say double it.

106
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:53,010
Scott: Just said hamburger, and then there was little hamburger.

107
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,974
Scott: I thought little hamburger was White Castle, but you didn't think hamburger ten bucks meant well No, because it's Manhattan.

108
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:00,576
Scott: That's you know.

109
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,282
Rym: yeah, but still for 13.

110
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:04,590
Rym: I get like a burger and fries and a root beer float.

111
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,262
Scott: That's about right.

112
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:10,966
Scott: Yeah See if I was nearer to like say the Shake Shack I would get that but I don't know.

113
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:12,759
Scott: maybe the head shakes there I didn't I didn't look.

114
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:19,338
Rym: I Couldn't have stomach to one anyway, so it didn't matter, but if a burger joint doesn't have shakes It is not truly a burger joint.

115
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,346
Rym: It's a real imitation.

116
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:22,250
Scott: I'm sure they have them.

117
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:28,790
Scott: I just I didn't even check but I Will probably return there again when I'm in need of a burger, but I will not get the double.

118
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:30,618
Rym: But we do have.

119
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:36,187
Rym: you know it's Thursday, but in lieu of news We've got a kind of a big announcement here for GeekNights.

120
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:39,682
Scott: Yes Well, this is sort of a. this is sort of a little announcement here right.

121
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:44,202
Scott: so on April 1st, which is Wednesday Something it's a couple Wednesdays for now.

122
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:47,598
Scott: so not next Wednesday But the Wednesday after that.

123
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,000
Scott: right.

124
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,320
Scott: so you got one weekend two weekends and then that Wednesday April 1st.

125
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,185
Scott: right we are going to do a GeekNights live show.

126
00:06:58,225 --> 00:07:10,850
Scott: basically what we're gonna Do is we're gonna record the show as usual But we are going to turn on the u-stream on a laptop or whatever and we'll pipe the audio into u-stream And maybe we'll turn on cameras so you can look at us.

127
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:19,770
Scott: But where you're not gonna really see much on the cameras except our they see me like hunched over My microphone and you'll see me sitting here with my eyes closed with a microphone on my face.

128
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,090
Scott: You know you know we're not gonna show you anything great.

129
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:22,812
Scott: You know.

130
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:23,876
Scott: it just will turn them on.

131
00:07:23,936 --> 00:07:29,154
Scott: because if we're using u-stream to stream the audio live and we have webcams Why not turn them on?

132
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:29,395
Scott: right?

133
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,699
Scott: it doesn't hurt right?

134
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,710
Scott: you know the bandwidth doesn't interfere with our local recording.

135
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,381
Scott: I mean if the internet went out we could actually in.

136
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:37,445
Scott: the electricity was on.

137
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:38,770
Scott: we can still record GeekNights.

138
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,429
Scott: You just couldn't upload it, so we're gonna do that, but we're also going to make it.

139
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,436
Scott: You know what's the reason of doing it live?

140
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,249
Scott: it's going to be a question e-show and ask Grim and Scott show.

141
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,355
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty much.

00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:43,005
Scott: So you know I'm gonna try to remember to remind everyone on every show we do until then.

157
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:46,693
Scott: so you know we can get the most participation Possible.

158
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:55,443
Rym: now of course if you don't want to be there live, and you don't have any questions for us We're gonna just air it as a GeekNights episode in the feed later.

159
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:57,289
Scott: Yeah like the same day probably.

160
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,570
Rym: yeah.

161
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:57,933
Rym: We'll see.

162
00:08:58,014 --> 00:08:58,337
Rym: we'll see.

163
00:08:58,377 --> 00:08:59,023
Rym: it is a Wednesday.

164
00:08:59,345 --> 00:08:59,769
Rym: We'll do it.

165
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,925
Rym: It'll be some time at night where we'll have more details as time comes on.

166
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:04,010
Scott: yeah, but that's that's the day.

167
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,311
Scott: We're gonna do it, so Yeah, be there.

168
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:09,353
Scott: pay attention such and such.

169
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:19,020
Rym: it's time for nothing lasts forever.

170
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:22,894
Scott: No some things last forever.

171
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:27,460
Rym: well well You know it didn't last forever is when the Port Authority took over, New York City.

172
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,032
Scott: You see the Port Authority already has taken over, New York City.

173
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:34,567
Rym: well as in the instituted martial law I mean, it's the Port Authority.

174
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:37,120
Rym: you figure they have some sort of authority over the but anyway.

175
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:38,244
Scott: So any weapons?

176
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:43,000
Rym: well, this is where things change when Dan Aykroyd is handled like the bridges in the airports.

177
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:48,275
Rym: So no one can get in or out of Manhattan without the Port Authority knowing about it anyway.

178
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,783
Scott: That's true because it's an island a Long time ago.

179
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:53,489
Rym: There is a movie that was made.

180
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,220
Rym: it was a Schiller film called nothing lasts forever.

181
00:09:56,802 --> 00:10:02,720
Rym: It was never released, but it was pretty much cast with nothing, but big-name stars.

182
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,523
Rym: it was one of those.

183
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:16,859
Rym: every famous person cameoed in it and Schiller was the guy who did all those like SNL videos and The movie had some copyright concerns and one thing led to another and as often happens in the movie industry The movie was never released in any form.

184
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,707
Scott: yeah I mean you know this movie.

185
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:21,057
Scott: there was also people I don't know how many people know about this.

186
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:23,165
Scott: there was actually a Fantastic four movie.

187
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:25,012
Scott: I think in the maybe the early 90s.

188
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:27,100
Scott: I forget the year it was I've seen it.

189
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:31,119
Scott: It's really terrible, but it was never put in theaters or on VHS.

190
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:34,693
Scott: You know for good reason, but it was completely finished.

191
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:35,516
Scott: You know they filmed it.

192
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:36,460
Scott: They edited the whole thing.

193
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:36,919
Scott: It was done.

194
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,000
Scott: They had a movie and you can get it on the internet in some places.

195
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:49,179
Scott: And you know those are two movies I know of that were finished completed made done, but never put in theaters or video or anything.

196
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,662
Scott: and You know.

197
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:53,875
Scott: I wonder how many others there are that we don't know about.

198
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:58,113
Rym: isn't there that Jerry Lewis Holocaust comedy, I don't know what that is.

199
00:10:58,434 --> 00:11:02,335
Rym: There's some sort of comedy I think someone mentioned in the forums that Jerry Lewis made.

200
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:09,059
Rym: that ends sadly But was in the Holocaust and it was about a clown and apparently it was horrifyingly a reference.

201
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:15,551
Scott: Something might be incredibly distasteful right I could see that.

202
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:30,137
Scott: why that might be a reason to you know not put it in theaters Not advertise it right, but it's no reason to you know not make it available through some you know channel But nothing lasts forever anyway Is it is a special case in that?

203
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,944
Rym: Schiller really wanted it to get out there and Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd and all the people in it Wanted to be out there.

204
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:41,560
Rym: in fact as far as I can tell almost everyone and almost everyone involved in the production.

205
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,131
Rym: there are a couple of notable exceptions, but Don't they?

206
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:45,920
Rym: we wanted to be out there?

207
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,362
Rym: They have no.

208
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:47,466
Scott: so basically everyone.

209
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:53,960
Scott: so unlike say the Fantastic Four movie where the people in it Probably didn't want anyone to see it anyway because it was terrible.

210
00:11:54,323 --> 00:12:01,260
Scott: This is a movie where the people in it were like oh my god We love this movie that we made let's make we want people to see it, but there were copyright concerns.

211
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:02,860
Rym: The movie was never released.

212
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:04,987
Rym: It's hardly ever even been screened.

213
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:05,168
Rym: like.

214
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:12,555
Rym: there have been an incredibly small number of screenings of this and all of them They're only screened because the director himself is there showing it.

215
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,303
Rym: and yeah special permission I think you know.

216
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:17,917
Scott: you saw the showing at the Eastman Theatre right in Rochester.

217
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:23,694
Scott: someone else I think said they saw it at The first like Santa Barbara Film Festival.

218
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:24,880
Scott: someone else saw it.

219
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:28,097
Scott: I think it was on cable television somewhere once like in the 80s.

220
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,548
Scott: There are people that taped it.

221
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:39,735
Rym: as far as I can tell that that showing in the 80s I think it was someone on public access who somehow had a copy just putting it out.

222
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:41,040
Scott: Oh you think that's what it was.

223
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,803
Rym: That's my guess.

224
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:55,885
Scott: I heard something about like Australia - maybe it's all sort of rumors cuz this is all 80s We're talking about here, so you know information like this from the 80s That got onto the internet is sort of you know not so reliable But the whole story was that.

225
00:12:55,925 --> 00:13:02,040
Rym: you know I saw this film with Emily and Alex and Emily's parents in Rochester Kind of out of nowhere.

226
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:03,849
Scott: You saw the actual film.

227
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:10,140
Rym: we saw the film a real screening of it And then we got a Q&A with Schiller himself, and he explained like yeah, this movie is never gonna come out.

228
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:11,368
Rym: I wish he could.

229
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:15,716
Rym: I think it's amazing and It's pretty amazing.

230
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:19,120
Rym: Put it that way, but I had a thing of the day last week.

231
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:23,160
Rym: I found what I thought was a trailer for it, and it had footage from the movie.

232
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:26,220
Rym: So I was like oh someone leaked the trailer great thing of the day.

233
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:28,873
Rym: And then I was gonna use it as the thing of the day.

234
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,040
Rym: Just you know hey check this out.

235
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,743
Rym: This is that movie.

236
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:32,331
Rym: I talked about way back on the show.

237
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:33,437
Rym: That's crazy.

238
00:13:33,457 --> 00:13:35,669
Rym: here You can get an idea of how crazy it was.

239
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:41,055
Rym: and then as we're about to do the show I noticed that you I'm thinking you know how did this trailer get leaked.

240
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:51,540
Rym: so I go to the users page and I see the guy basically said So uh I Liked this movie, and I realized there was no trailer, so I made one to which I responded wait a minute.

241
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:52,725
Rym: How did you make one?

242
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,674
Rym: that means you have the stupid film?

243
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:56,160
Rym: Why is it not on the internet?

244
00:13:56,682 --> 00:14:00,963
Rym: So we go to the Pirate Bay and sure enough There's a torrent.

245
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:06,580
Scott: yes some guy tapes it off cable apparently on to a VHS and then put the VHS on the internet.

246
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,930
Scott: So when you saw the movie was it what?

247
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,874
Scott: was the aspect ratio?

248
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:11,019
Scott: was a widescreen or was it?

249
00:14:11,722 --> 00:14:13,309
Rym: Believe it was widescreen was it?

250
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:13,973
Scott: so I don't know.

251
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:15,480
Scott: maybe this VHS is missing.

252
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,765
Scott: You know half the movie it.

253
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,573
Rym: You know it wouldn't matter.

254
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:22,028
Scott: Oh really this movie It's not that kind of movie.

255
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,460
Rym: this movie is something special anyway.

256
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:30,014
Rym: So because we haven't even watched this yet, but it seems like it is the actual movie.

257
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:32,200
Rym: so get on this torrent.

258
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:37,081
Scott: I mean you know you might be talking about right copyright infringement Whatever.

259
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:43,700
Scott: not what you know you have some maybe you're the kind of person is really really you know against infringing on copyright or whatever.

260
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:54,674
Scott: seriously is the movie where everyone who made it wants it to be out and You know wants you to watch it and the copyright is preventing it from being out.

261
00:14:54,734 --> 00:15:01,392
Scott: if there was never a better justification for using bit torrents to illegally download something than this.

262
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:06,900
Rym: so get the word out get everyone on this torrent and The movie is pretty good.

263
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,320
Rym: I'd really like to hear what you people have to think about this because this

264
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:16,892
Scott: It's not the kind of movie that everyone in the world will like but it I have a feeling it is there a lot of People who it just will appreciate it

265
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:18,220
Rym: for the longest time.

266
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:29,500
Rym: It was like this the ultimate inside joke with me and Emily and Alex we could make we could make references to it And we know for a fact that no one we run into will have seen this movie or know what we're talking about.

267
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:30,858
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

268
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:32,708
Scott: It's like you know.

269
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:36,971
Scott: I mean if you come up with something on your own And you know no one you run into will know about it right.

270
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:49,090
Rym: the fact that it is a first your film exact motion picture a full one a complete one that was screened in some theaters that has Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd and like 15 other like I like.

271
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,723
Scott: imagine imagine if I don't know Ghostbusters Right.

272
00:15:52,744 --> 00:16:02,319
Scott: it was only ever screened like three times And maybe it was on cable once and like only maybe 50 people in the world that actually seen it And you were the one who had seen it.

273
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,301
Scott: And you're like you come down the street And you're like.

274
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:12,600
Scott: if someone asked if you're a god you say yes, and no one knows you're talking about Nobody except you and your friend who are at that incredibly rare screening.

275
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:17,980
Rym: I think a better example is Ghostbusters 2 because Ghostbusters 1 is one of the greatest movies ever know.

276
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,199
Scott: But I'm saying imagine if only so few people had seen it.

277
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,920
Rym: But at the same time I think Ghostbusters 2 is a better analogy because this movie is not that good.

278
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:28,130
Scott: Oh, you're talking about the quality hit algae.

279
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,460
Scott: Yes in terms of I wasn't comparing the quality.

280
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,804
Scott: I was come.

281
00:16:30,844 --> 00:16:32,200
Scott: I was just making an analogy.

282
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:36,039
Rym: It's like what if you were the only person in the world who'd ever seen Star Wars.

283
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:39,720
Scott: well No, I was making the analogy for you know the inside joke not for the quality of the.

284
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:43,108
Rym: It'd be like having it anyway this movie.

285
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:43,871
Rym: Good.

286
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:44,353
Rym: God good.

287
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:52,219
Scott: God All right, so um you know thanks to the Internet's and whatnot right?

288
00:16:53,621 --> 00:17:08,278
Scott: One of the things I love to find on the internet are like new inventions right that are actually Resolving sort of like everyday Problems right and a lot of times this sort of thing is usually like an as-seen-on-tv And it's some piece of crap bullshit, right?

289
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:16,763
Scott: But once in a once in a while you come across like some new invention that actually is Something that will help.

290
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,950
Scott: you know not some like funky spoon.

291
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,200
Scott: That's no better than a regular spoon or some funky knife.

292
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:23,898
Scott: There's no better than regular knife, right?

293
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:28,493
Scott: This here is this actually this whole website mo q7.

294
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:30,140
Scott: I think it might be called mock seven.

295
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,582
Scott: I don't know.

296
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:34,677
Scott: Oh, no my mo Q stands for minimum order quantity.

297
00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:40,895
Scott: right and the way this site works is You know they have.

298
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:57,080
Scott: Basically they get next like sort of like next generation awesome stuff right like new inventions and things and They put them up for sale but Until they meet the minimum order quantity no one actually gets anything right.

299
00:17:57,381 --> 00:18:00,575
Scott: it's like let's say you invent like a new kind of hairbrush or something right.

300
00:18:00,595 --> 00:18:03,820
Scott: you put it up on this site and You say all right?

301
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:15,900
Scott: I'm selling them for five bucks and minimum order quantity is 10,000. so as soon as you get 10,000 orders Then you'd manufacture and sell and if you never get the orders before time runs out then everyone just gets their money back, right?

302
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:22,280
Scott: So on this website, they're selling something here that actually I think I'm gonna buy a whole bunch of maybe like five of them, right?

303
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,319
Scott: Mostly because they cost a dollar and 18 cents each.

304
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:29,538
Scott: What this is is the brush and rinse toothbrush.

305
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,192
Scott: now You know I've always used the oral B toothbrush, which I like very much all right.

306
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:41,979
Scott: It's very trustworthy dentist approved, but You know sometimes you're brushing your teeth right and there's no cup available.

307
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:46,887
Rym: now I just reached down and put the Faucet and that's on the faucet.

308
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:47,870
Rym: you Phil Steen?

309
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:48,793
Scott: no no you couldn't.

310
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,160
Scott: you know you can put your head under the faucet right.

311
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,688
Scott: you can also do the Water hand in the cupped hands.

312
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:57,517
Rym: Yeah, you know I've never done that without making a mess.

313
00:18:57,618 --> 00:18:58,300
Scott: It does doesn't work.

314
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,314
Scott: I can't do it right cuz my hands are not cupped.

315
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:04,938
Scott: very well The thing is right even head under the faucet.

316
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:05,320
Scott: that works.

317
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,466
Scott: Okay, and like a kitchen sink right, but if you got a big head a little sink It's really not the.

318
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:11,852
Scott: it's not the best situation.

319
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:12,757
Scott: It's not comfortable.

320
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:13,500
Scott: It's not easy.

321
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:32,018
Scott: It's not as it's not as luxurious as having a cup there right, but even if you do have a cup right That means that you're gonna have to wash this cup and the cup sits in the bathroom and takes some space in the bathroom Counter and if you travel you got to bring the cup with you, right?

322
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,078
Rym: Well if you're traveling you can use the cup in the hotel.

323
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:37,850
Scott: well But you can't trust those hotel cups remember.

324
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,460
Scott: Oh, yeah, yeah, they clean them with Windex.

325
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:41,426
Rym: There's a hint.

326
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:47,140
Scott: never use a cup in a hotel You know do use a cup in a hotel if it's plastic and it's wrapped in plastic.

327
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:48,042
Scott: Right.

328
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:58,101
Scott: don't use the glass cups in the hotel unless you bring your own sponges and dish detergent washing yourself Right which is a lot more difficult than just bringing your own cup Right.

329
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:00,732
Scott: so this toothbrush is the brush and rinse toothbrush.

330
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:02,298
Scott: There's a video showing you how it works.

331
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:06,460
Scott: basically This toothbrush has spouts built into it, right?

332
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:14,989
Scott: So what you do is you put one part of the toothbrush under the faucet and the other part of the toothbrush will have water Spraying out of it.

333
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:16,560
Scott: Just like a water fountain.

334
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:24,083
Scott: So you brush your teeth then you put your toothbrush under the sink and water comes out and you rinse your mouth out with no Cup needed.

335
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,169
Rym: gotta check out the video.

336
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:25,873
Rym: It's pretty cool.

337
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:27,341
Scott: and look a dollar 18.

338
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:30,481
Scott: I mean toothbrushes at the store are more than that Right.

339
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:37,122
Scott: the oral bees and the reaches and the Colgate's or whatever toothbrushes are more than a dollar 18 even when they're on sale All right.

340
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:39,494
Scott: I mean, maybe you get a free one at the dentist.

341
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:43,576
Scott: That's that's a better deal Right, but that always has your dentist name on it, right?

342
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:53,680
Scott: It's always sorta Dollar 18 for like, you know, even if you're not using this your everyday toothbrush It's the ultimate travel toothbrush because now you can travel that much lighter, right?

343
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:56,238
Scott: So I'm definitely gonna order like five of them.

344
00:20:57,243 --> 00:21:03,327
Scott: I suggest if you brush your teeth and you're not some disgusting person That's your teeth.

345
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:08,452
Scott: brush your teeth, but your goddamn teeth Right that you also order a few.

346
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:14,720
Scott: because right now the minimum order They've sold 12,000 about and the minimum order is 50,000.

347
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,464
Scott: So we're gonna need.

348
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:17,515
Scott: we're gonna need some help if we want these.

349
00:21:17,535 --> 00:21:19,965
Rym: so I'm pretty much.

350
00:21:19,985 --> 00:21:22,211
Rym: I plan to get some just for travel.

351
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:23,656
Rym: Yeah, I think they're cool.

352
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:24,759
Scott: It's good.

353
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:30,640
Scott: Plus it's a cool novelty just to show people you're like, ooh, all right.

354
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:40,116
Scott: so so I guess we do the baseball show like baseball.

355
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,637
Scott: I Love that.

356
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:47,497
Scott: Yeah, we had a little trouble coming up with to do a show on right but the baseball season is approaching.

357
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:48,360
Scott: it's Thursday.

358
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:50,509
Scott: We have not done a show on baseball.

359
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,859
Scott: We also have not done a show with very much Disagreement in a long time.

360
00:21:55,681 --> 00:22:00,740
Scott: So I thought this might be a pretty good show idea considering I like baseball quite a bit.

361
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,711
Scott: It's not my favorite thing in the world and I'm indifferent to baseball.

362
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:06,340
Scott: I thought you were very much hated baseball.

363
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:09,420
Rym: You know, it's hard to hate it because I don't like particular.

364
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,273
Rym: I don't like watching baseball on TV because I feel like there's no point.

365
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:19,156
Rym: It's not interesting to watch and I don't mind watching it in person because I like hanging out at the stadium with people.

366
00:22:19,196 --> 00:22:19,820
Rym: It's a fun day.

367
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:21,588
Rym: I love playing baseball.

368
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,241
Rym: I absolutely love playing baseball Mm-hmm.

369
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:26,887
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

370
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:30,900
Rym: I think that you're not gonna get some sort of diatribe of baseball's not stupidest sport ever.

371
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,151
Rym: I reserve that for curling.

372
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:34,384
Scott: Oh But that way do I agree?

373
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:36,270
Scott: The curling is also the stupidest sport ever.

374
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:36,751
Scott: It doesn't help.

375
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:40,638
Rym: Well, yeah, it's not the stupidest It's just it's pretty damn well.

376
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:55,811
Scott: I think the reason that a lot of people are down on baseball spectating right and is that it's The enjoyment of you know, watching a sport like say hockey or You know football right is is in the action of it, right?

377
00:22:55,852 --> 00:23:03,033
Scott: There's lots of action, you know almost constantly You know, I guess more so in hockey than football right because football stops right.

378
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:09,980
Scott: the action is you know hard-hitting Exciting action and there's lots and lots of like feats of strength going on.

379
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:16,907
Scott: You know, that's as very exciting right, but baseball really doesn't entertain You know those same things.

380
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:20,220
Scott: I mean sure there's occasional feats of strength in baseball.

381
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:24,799
Scott: I mean really everything is the feat of strength in baseball, but you don't really realize it.

382
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:25,503
Scott: It's just.

383
00:23:25,623 --> 00:23:29,480
Scott: you know, it's very rare that there's a feat of strength that actually looks like a feat of strength.

384
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:36,159
Scott: I mean like you think about it like every pitch right dude throws the ball 90 miles an hour Like how many times but you don't go?

385
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,645
Scott: Wow, every time you only go.

386
00:23:37,705 --> 00:23:41,660
Scott: wow when it's like, you know some crazy outfield like dive or something, you know.

387
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:50,040
Scott: But You know baseball is really less about the action and more about the suspense and the situations, you know.

388
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,823
Scott: So it's almost.

389
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:55,987
Scott: you know, if sports were movies, it's like baseball is like a different genre He's in the pickle.

390
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:56,469
Rym: It's a pickle.

391
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:57,294
Scott: Yeah, it's.

392
00:23:57,374 --> 00:23:58,420
Scott: and then the other thing.

393
00:24:00,163 --> 00:24:06,460
Scott: Well, there are situations in baseball besides, you know, there's two kinds of situations we're talking about here.

394
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,720
Scott: Right one kind of situation is you know the pickle or the the stealing home plate, right?

395
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:18,460
Scott: Those are very rare at least in Major League Baseball in the United States because everyone's a professional.

396
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:18,982
Scott: So they're not.

397
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:23,020
Scott: they're so good at playing that they never get into a stupid situation like that, right?

398
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,050
Scott: And that's actually a problem in sort of all professional sports.

399
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,460
Scott: Is that the players are so good that stupid shit doesn't happen.

400
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:38,086
Scott: That's why people like, you know college hockey college basketball college football, you know so much is because You watch like professional football.

401
00:24:38,668 --> 00:24:40,394
Scott: You're never gonna see like a Statue of Liberty play.

402
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:42,020
Scott: I don't think they're allowed, right?

403
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,300
Scott: You know, you're never gonna see anyone run the option in the NFL ever or the trick play.

404
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:49,447
Rym: This isn't the right ball.

405
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,460
Scott: This isn't the right ball right in college football.

406
00:24:53,042 --> 00:25:04,460
Scott: That shit totally works because there's a lot of people on the field that are probably not gonna play football for the rest of their Lives as professionals, you know, they're not that good and they'll fall for that shit You get actually works in the NFL.

407
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:06,485
Scott: It's never gonna work ever.

408
00:25:06,887 --> 00:25:07,669
Scott: It's you're just gonna.

409
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:10,800
Scott: you're just gonna get you know, get hit you're gonna fall over.

410
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,687
Scott: This can be a big sack huge me.

411
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:16,661
Rym: You turn it over quarterback gets up like this is the right ball and they kill him Right.

412
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:18,411
Scott: It's the same thing in baseball right, you know?

413
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:20,000
Scott: in like Little League Baseball, right?

414
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,400
Scott: If you get a if someone walks you right you can run to first and just keep running to second.

415
00:25:24,984 --> 00:25:26,880
Scott: That's a legal play in Major League Baseball.

416
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:29,692
Scott: But notice in the major leagues no one runs to first.

417
00:25:29,752 --> 00:25:31,500
Scott: when they get a walk they walk casually.

418
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:37,080
Scott: Number one because you don't want to risk injury when you're that valuable and two it's not gonna work.

419
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:38,848
Scott: That play never works.

420
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:41,059
Scott: No one even tries it even though it's totally allowed.

421
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:48,800
Scott: But yeah The other thing the situations in Major League Baseball that I think make it entertaining are sort of like these suspense situations.

422
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:52,333
Scott: Right, like, you know, it's you know, you it's the.

423
00:25:52,494 --> 00:25:54,240
Scott: it's the end of the inning, right?

424
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,007
Scott: You you know, you're you.

425
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:58,720
Scott: you got two outs this guy's on base.

426
00:25:59,162 --> 00:26:02,720
Scott: You're either gonna you know get out or you're gonna get a bunch of runs, right?

427
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,028
Scott: It's gonna go one way or the other.

428
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:06,040
Scott: so it's sort of like a burning wheel situation, right?

429
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:12,727
Scott: either you're gonna get all the successes and something crazy awesome is gonna happen or You did all that work getting all those.

430
00:26:12,928 --> 00:26:18,152
Scott: all those previous hits are for nothing cuz you got those guys on base But they're not gonna score any runs cuz you totally fucked it up.

431
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:21,848
Scott: and then you know You're in that situation already, right.

432
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:33,320
Scott: and then you start getting strike ball ball Another strike and it's like you're already in a tense situation where it's like it's either make it or break it right here.

433
00:26:33,982 --> 00:26:39,862
Scott: And then you sort of once you get to that point you start to inch closer and closer to where you know That's it.

434
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:43,957
Scott: This next pitch is it no matter what unless he fouls it off, you know, that's is.

435
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,703
Scott: it is no Right.

436
00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:53,351
Scott: and you get closer and closer to like, you know the the complete edge Before something actually happens and that you know.

437
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:55,880
Scott: suspense of waiting is you know can really?

438
00:26:56,321 --> 00:27:01,420
Scott: Provide quite a bit of thrilling entertainment, but I think it only works if you actually care.

439
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,244
Rym: Yeah, see that's the trouble.

440
00:27:03,385 --> 00:27:09,220
Rym: baseball is the only sport I've ever seen in person where I will occasionally not notice that play is resumed.

441
00:27:09,822 --> 00:27:14,140
Rym: Yeah, I mean if you don't be sitting there and I hear crack and I look I was like, oh right baseball.

442
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:18,540
Scott: Well, see if you're watching an action sport, right?

443
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:26,931
Scott: You don't have to care who wins or loses to get the entertainment because you're watching a lot of things happen a lot They're very quick and they're very entertaining.

444
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:32,528
Scott: this movement and things happening in Baseball, you know all the entertainment is in the suspense.

445
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:44,900
Scott: and while it might be a suspenseful situation and you might recognize that suspenseful situation right Suspense doesn't work unless you care about the result even in like a movie right you're watching a movie, right?

446
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,327
Scott: Let's say the suspenseful situation this guy.

447
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:52,754
Scott: He's not gonna save the day or he's gonna die within like the next, you know minute He's you know, he's gonna spring a trap.

448
00:27:52,815 --> 00:27:53,340
Scott: What's he gonna do?

449
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,171
Scott: He's walking down the scary hallway.

450
00:27:55,191 --> 00:27:55,735
Scott: It's all dark.

451
00:27:55,835 --> 00:28:02,220
Scott: Ooh, right If you don't care if the guy lives or dies, there's no suspense.

452
00:28:02,342 --> 00:28:03,074
Scott: There's just you know.

453
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:18,634
Scott: You have to actually care about what is going to happen in order to have the feeling of suspense Overcome you and I think that's the thing with baseball is that if you don't care which team is gonna win Then there's no suspense because you don't care if it's gonna be an out or a hit.

454
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:20,160
Scott: It's it's could go either way.

455
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,307
Scott: It doesn't make a difference to you.

456
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,480
Scott: So there is no suspense.

457
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,956
Scott: You're just you know, you're just waiting for it to be over and it's gonna be over either way.

458
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:28,921
Scott: So I Don't know.

459
00:28:29,645 --> 00:28:32,200
Scott: I think that might be why you're indifferent to baseball.

460
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,327
Scott: I think maybe if you you know had a team that you cared about a whole bunch like maybe if RIT's big thing was Baseball instead of hockey see even that.

461
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:43,300
Rym: no cuz I mean I grew up watching the Tigers and you know, that's why explains a lot.

462
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:46,738
Rym: No, I don't think that is because I'm also a Lions fan.

463
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:50,060
Scott: Explains a lot.

464
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:54,895
Rym: But how come I'm such a fan of the Lions and yet I couldn't care less about this?

465
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:59,472
Scott: because the Lions have a culture of Losing but the Tigers don't really have so much of a culture.

466
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:03,308
Rym: really they had a culture of losing for a while when I was A kid and should have been a White Sox fan.

467
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:04,916
Rym: Nah lived in Detroit.

468
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:09,275
Rym: Yeah So why would I have been a fan of the White Sox Chicago's close enough?

469
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,160
Rym: No, it's not.

470
00:29:10,341 --> 00:29:12,433
Scott: Chicago has much better teams than Detroit.

471
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:12,655
Scott: All

472
00:29:12,997 --> 00:29:24,249
Rym: right, let's see I remember a distinct point not that long ago when I could say that Detroit had the number one team in every major sport because the Red Wings were number one and the Pistons were number one and

473
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,668
Scott: The Pistons went downhill this season big day

474
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:30,639
Rym: and the Tigers were number one and football hadn't started yet.

475
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:34,611
Rym: Yeah, that was my joke.

476
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:36,058
Rym: I made that for about four months.

477
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:48,020
Rym: yeah but baseball just There's not like a lot of the drama and the up-close stuff like I guess use that I don't care about the teams or the Sports or like any of the stuff outside of the game itself.

478
00:29:48,702 --> 00:30:01,260
Rym: So the game itself comes down to one guy doing this feat of strength over and over again against these other people who are doing This other feat of strength and dexterity over and over again and the people in the outfield be either play perfectly or completely fuck up.

479
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:03,380
Rym: There's no middle ground when they bump into each other.

480
00:30:04,281 --> 00:30:11,514
Rym: Either like the game people play perfectly and it comes down to such tiny Margins of victory kind of like watching an f1 race.

481
00:30:11,554 --> 00:30:12,680
Rym: It becomes less and less interest.

482
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:14,920
Scott: Well, you can watch like some minor league baseball, right?

483
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:19,219
Scott: And then you know, the margin is way bigger because the players are not nearly as good.

484
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:22,452
Rym: I actually enjoy minor league baseball a lot more than major league.

485
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,660
Scott: The funny thing is is that minor league baseball stadium?

486
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,520
Scott: We could literally walk to it from our house and like 20 minutes and we've never gone there.

487
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,606
Rym: We haven't we should.

488
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:30,894
Scott: I've always planned to go there.

489
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:31,920
Scott: We just never happens.

490
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:33,834
Scott: Well, you know, we'll have a chance real soon.

491
00:30:33,854 --> 00:30:34,640
Scott: I'll get the schedule.

492
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:38,619
Rym: Yeah, we'll figure out get the crew out for the burning wheel weekend and we'll go to a baseball game.

493
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:39,482
Scott: We'll see.

494
00:30:39,543 --> 00:30:42,332
Scott: if that happens a lot of people won't want to go.

495
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:43,155
Rym: I'll make it happen.

496
00:30:43,315 --> 00:30:46,063
Rym: All right, I'll go though There's two options.

497
00:30:46,103 --> 00:30:48,814
Rym: They can either come to the baseball game or stay home and play.

498
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:49,416
Scott: Wow.

499
00:30:49,778 --> 00:30:50,380
Scott: No, great.

500
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:01,471
Rym: Though I think something needs to be said about playing baseball because play baseball is a sport that Pretty much anyone in reasonable physical shape can play.

501
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:02,594
Rym: You don't need to be an athlete.

502
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:04,580
Rym: You can play baseball and have fun.

503
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:19,375
Rym: Mmm, and I wish I played more baseball because in high school, I played baseball all the time like every summer every Sunday We'd all get together and we used to play softball But it got to the point where everyone hit the softball over the fence every time.

504
00:31:19,415 --> 00:31:21,000
Rym: so then we started playing baseball instead.

505
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:22,570
Rym: Yeah, and then we had strikes.

506
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:27,472
Rym: Yeah That's a problem because no one really could pitch the softball.

507
00:31:27,492 --> 00:31:29,440
Rym: very well none of us were good at baseball.

508
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,200
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, that's that's the thing is that you know.

509
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,474
Scott: You watch people play baseball like profession even minor league baseball, right?

510
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:40,680
Scott: And you watch a guy like, you know There'll be a ground ball to show to the shortstop.

511
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,880
Scott: The shortstop will throw it to first base and get the guy out every single time and it looks like nothing right?

512
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,406
Scott: Try to do that.

513
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,140
Scott: It's not it's not easy.

514
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,940
Scott: You'll throw it like you'll miss the first base will go over his head and go off to the side.

515
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:53,285
Scott: You won't throw it hard enough.

516
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:56,920
Scott: It won't make it there, you know, maybe you'll throw it too hard into the stands.

517
00:31:57,421 --> 00:31:57,582
Scott: It's.

518
00:31:57,802 --> 00:32:00,670
Scott: it's very, you know, you everything that these players do.

519
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:04,280
Scott: that looks so casual and makes the game seem kind of boring.

520
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:12,100
Scott: If you actually try to do it like every little just the normal things that they do over and over again are actually really difficult.

521
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,540
Scott: I mean, you know think about it, you know in Little League, you know You have to worry about things like I was in Little League.

522
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,919
Scott: I had to worry about things if I was in the outfield like which base do I throw it to?

523
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:24,050
Scott: Major League players never don't know what base to throw it to.

524
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,920
Scott: they throw it to the correct base immediately every time.

525
00:32:27,642 --> 00:32:29,047
Scott: It's not so easy.

526
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:31,094
Rym: Of course in baseball simulator.

527
00:32:31,114 --> 00:32:32,579
Rym: I haven't throw it to the wrong base.

528
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:43,327
Scott: Yeah, that happens well because But then again in baseball simulator, it's made up for the fact that I set myself on fire Before I throw the pitch.

529
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:44,973
Rym: the missile was the best one.

530
00:32:45,134 --> 00:32:45,616
Rym: I don't know.

531
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:50,879
Rym: I like the one that went back and forth Or how about the one that just reversed the controls on the outfielders.

532
00:32:51,482 --> 00:32:52,625
Rym: Basically just get a home run.

533
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:53,227
Rym: Yeah, I'll be.

534
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:54,831
Rym: I every time I don't.

535
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:59,448
Scott: I seem to remember like eventually mastering controlling The outfielders in reverse, you know what I did.

536
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:01,839
Rym: I always just flip my controller upside down and went.

537
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:05,974
Rym: oh It was easier to deal with that mirroring than with the full mirroring.

538
00:33:06,376 --> 00:33:07,039
Scott: It's not bad.

539
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:11,580
Rym: My brother accused me of cheating and then we didn't play baseball simulator together for a while.

540
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:12,202
Scott: Yeah, it's weird.

541
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:16,920
Scott: the baseball actually makes a really good video game more so than most other sports.

542
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,342
Rym: No football can have a really good video game - yeah It's just.

543
00:33:20,402 --> 00:33:26,123
Scott: I just wish that you know Madden didn't have the exclusive license and now we probably see some other football I'd love to see.

544
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:27,008
Rym: well, maybe we'll get.

545
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:28,759
Rym: we got to get some sort of blood ball back.

546
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:31,291
Scott: Yeah, well, there's a new blood ball game coming out.

547
00:33:31,331 --> 00:33:33,220
Scott: I'm sort of you know, they've said some things about it.

548
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,427
Scott: I'm kind of interested.

549
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:35,573
Scott: I'm looking forward to it.

550
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:36,820
Scott: At least I hope it'll be good.

551
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:38,298
Scott: But if it's not good, I just won't buy it.

552
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:39,404
Scott: I'm sure there'll be a demo.

553
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:48,091
Rym: but seriously like when we were to play baseball in high school and every Sunday and we had like The core group of like 15 people who would always show up But every time like random people would show up.

554
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:50,463
Rym: and a lot of these people were not athletes.

555
00:33:50,503 --> 00:34:02,809
Rym: many of them were in my Dungeons & Dragons game in high school and Even the like the nerd like the people who were the least physically able Occasionally hit a good one or caught something in the outfield.

556
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:06,160
Rym: like everyone can play baseball as long even if you don't have legs.

557
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:08,070
Rym: I've seen people in wheelchairs play baseball.

558
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:10,020
Scott: Oh, yeah, you could totally play baseball in a wheelchair.

559
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,956
Rym: No, if you don't have arms or legs, you might have trouble but otherwise you can play baseball.

560
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:17,478
Scott: Yeah Yeah, you mean you can play baseball with just legs.

561
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,259
Rym: You know, well, I guess you could bunt.

562
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:21,706
Scott: Well, no You just did.

563
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,476
Scott: you just attach.

564
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:25,070
Scott: so, you know You could definitely play in the field if you just attach a glove to.

565
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,657
Rym: you also have to bet you can't.

566
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:27,926
Rym: you don't have that Many pinch hitters.

567
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,400
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

568
00:34:30,562 --> 00:34:32,371
Scott: I'm sure with technology and prosthetics.

569
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:33,498
Scott: There is definitely a way.

570
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,733
Rym: just That leads to the cyborg league.

571
00:34:37,315 --> 00:34:38,480
Scott: cyborg league is awesome.

572
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:41,591
Rym: What was that game like robot baseball on the NES?

573
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:42,574
Scott: was the robot?

574
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:43,337
Scott: Yeah, there's kind.

575
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:43,838
Scott: there was.

576
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:44,300
Scott: you're right.

577
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,630
Scott: What was it called a Super Nintendo the head robot?

578
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,574
Scott: I think it was Super Nintendo.

579
00:34:47,594 --> 00:34:49,080
Rym: I think it was also on the regular Nintendo.

580
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,391
Scott: Well, I don't remember on the regular.

581
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:51,418
Scott: I think I remember on the super.

582
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:57,557
Scott: I remember regular because they're very similar designs to the bots master who had sports playing robots at his.

583
00:34:58,038 --> 00:34:58,800
Rym: yes, that is true.

584
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:05,857
Scott: Yeah, I think the one other thing about baseball that it has that some of the other sports don't have is that it is very old.

585
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:08,808
Scott: Right compared to say, you know football.

586
00:35:08,828 --> 00:35:10,592
Scott: I mean look it was just Super Bowl.

587
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:12,096
Scott: what like 42 last, you know.

588
00:35:12,096 --> 00:35:14,386
Scott: 43 I think right.

589
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:21,733
Scott: Well roboting has a long and Right, so really baseball is wicked ancient.

590
00:35:21,773 --> 00:35:23,157
Scott: I mean it was played in the late 1800s.

591
00:35:24,481 --> 00:35:25,607
Rym: That's not that ancient though.

592
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:27,115
Rym: Just know most older sports.

593
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:28,160
Rym: We don't play anymore.

594
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:33,577
Scott: I know that's what I'm saying is baseball is like the oldest sport that's still around even though it's not exact.

595
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:36,267
Scott: hi lie Hi lies pretty old.

596
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:36,890
Rym: You're right.

597
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,372
Rym: Yeah.

598
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:38,778
Rym: Yeah, that's that's right.

599
00:35:38,818 --> 00:35:42,132
Scott: Yeah Sumo sumo is pretty old.

600
00:35:42,152 --> 00:35:44,546
Rym: Yeah Wrestling record roman wrestling.

601
00:35:44,566 --> 00:35:47,760
Scott: Yeah, but by any sort of fighting in general is very old.

602
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:51,459
Scott: Yeah, I guess I guess the only sport, you know, there's also all the Olympic sports from.

603
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:54,396
Scott: you know The original Olympics like Greece, you know running is still.

604
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:56,423
Scott: you know It's kind of old.

605
00:35:56,784 --> 00:36:01,238
Scott: but but if you look at like the major sports right at least in you know in the world right.

606
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:03,787
Scott: soccer Car racing is very new.

607
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:05,252
Rym: soccer is very old too.

608
00:36:05,272 --> 00:36:07,420
Scott: I don't know soccer older than baseball.

609
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,968
Rym: I think soccer is older than baseball.

610
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:09,571
Scott: You think so?

611
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:10,274
Scott: I don't think so.

612
00:36:10,596 --> 00:36:12,705
Scott: I'm pretty sure To look that one up.

613
00:36:12,725 --> 00:36:13,668
Rym: you keep talking.

614
00:36:13,689 --> 00:36:14,471
Rym: I'll Wikipedia.

615
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:29,960
Scott: All right, but at least football Basketball even ice hockey are all newer than baseball right and in America, at least they've done a really good job Sort of creating this really sort of historic feel to baseball.

616
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:40,186
Scott: It's like when you go to see a basketball game unless you go to Boston It doesn't feel historic, you know, if you go to see a football game It doesn't feel like historic.

617
00:36:40,226 --> 00:36:41,751
Scott: unless you go to Pittsburgh see.

618
00:36:41,811 --> 00:36:45,783
Rym: but a hockey game would have felt historic if you sat in the Coliseum In Detroit.

619
00:36:45,843 --> 00:36:46,948
Scott: Well, yeah a hockey game.

620
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:53,370
Scott: if you go to one of the original six, it feels historic Right, but if you go anywhere else not so much.

621
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,252
Scott: but baseball.

622
00:36:54,673 --> 00:37:03,058
Scott: even if you go to like one of the expansion teams You know Like one of the really new teams like I like the Colorado Rockies or even like the Tampa Bay Rays or something like that

623
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:04,803
Rym: Because

624
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:14,319
Scott: the sport is so old you still get that really old Sort of you know apple pie kind of feeling when you go to a baseball game or watch it even on TV.

625
00:37:14,661 --> 00:37:16,557
Rym: It's got the football medieval Europe.

626
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:20,350
Scott: Wait, you know American football or soccer soccer?

627
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:20,872
Scott: Oh, okay.

628
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:21,214
Scott: Yeah.

629
00:37:21,234 --> 00:37:21,755
Scott: All right.

630
00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:31,680
Scott: Yes, you know, okay So so so soccer is older than baseball, but soccer is not so popular in the United States However, it's popular everywhere else in the world.

631
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,880
Scott: And also I don't get a feeling of oldness when I go to when I watch soccer either But that might just be the way it's sold.

632
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:55,100
Rym: it is always amazing to me though that you that the US like the economy and the population and the size of it is such that The United States has several entire sports that are big enough Inside the country to have as many teams in there as the rest of the world has in most other sports.

633
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:03,710
Scott: Well, I think the reason for that is just geography, you know, we have such a wide geography that you can have, you know New York versus, you know, California.

634
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,459
Rym: So how come we don't have Vladivostok versus st.

635
00:38:06,499 --> 00:38:06,860
Rym: Petersburg?

636
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:08,089
Scott: Well, you can't.

637
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:12,030
Scott: you could have that in Russia But the thing is most of Russia is Siberia?

638
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,857
Scott: right if you look at the only the inhabited parts.

639
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:20,284
Rym: It's not really Okay, so there's a picture in this Wikipedia article I thought you were gonna do.

640
00:38:20,304 --> 00:38:35,297
Rym: I thought you were gonna argue with me against the point I made about Siberia of Richard Linden 1880 who is believed to have invented the first real soccer ball Mm-hmm, and he's holding the two rubber balls and there's just something kind of hilarious about this picture.

641
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:36,824
Rym: his fate I don't know.

642
00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:38,031
Rym: He looks disturbed.

643
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:39,219
Scott: What's the Wikipedia page?

644
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:41,574
Rym: Football football, okay football.

645
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:44,966
Rym: But Scott you can see this picture.

646
00:38:45,307 --> 00:38:46,330
Rym: This picture is epic.

647
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:46,752
Scott: I'm waiting.

648
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:47,354
Scott: I'm just loading.

649
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:52,120
Scott: I'm seeing a picture of Scroll down like I'm scrolling Richard Linden.

650
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:06,512
Rym: He I don't know if he's excited or disturbed or what but I think he's just like hey check out my balls But he's got one eyebrow up and one.

651
00:39:06,673 --> 00:39:07,557
Rym: maybe he had a stroke.

652
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:07,979
Rym: I don't know.

653
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:12,073
Scott: I really like that picture of the Calcio Fiorentino field.

654
00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:15,382
Rym: He's got kind of a skull face to 1688.

655
00:39:15,382 --> 00:39:16,305
Scott: Wow, that's pretty.

656
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:20,540
Rym: not as not as much of a skull face as Grand Moff Tarkin, but a skull face nonetheless.

657
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:23,820
Scott: Yeah, well, I think just you know the aesthetic of baseball.

658
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,420
Scott: It's like when you go to a baseball game.

659
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,811
Scott: It feels like you're also going to even if it's a brand new stadium.

660
00:39:29,273 --> 00:39:31,098
Scott: It sort of feels like museum.

661
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:34,751
Scott: ish You know, it's like you're not just watching a modern sporting event.

662
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:41,903
Scott: You're also watching, you know, and like an old thing It's like you're going back in time - well, I think that that's part of it like most of the appeal.

663
00:39:42,305 --> 00:39:46,620
Rym: non my playing baseball has but just watching baseball is the.

664
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:48,287
Rym: I don't know the history.

665
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:50,235
Rym: It's kind of like a museum exhibit to me.

666
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:57,020
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, and I guess you know even soccer which I guess we now have discovered is much older than baseball, right?

667
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:03,700
Scott: They have you know, you go to the stadium right people are you know chanting and you know, you've got all these advertisements.

668
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:12,559
Scott: They even have advertisements on the jerseys, you know Nothing about it feels old or feels, you know, yes because no one advertises in baseball.

669
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,844
Rym: baseball Is this song?

670
00:40:13,864 --> 00:40:15,210
Scott: No, but they don't advertise.

671
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:19,928
Scott: No, they don't advertise on the uniforms You know, they it's not on the field and they.

672
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:23,520
Scott: you know the game, you know, they advertise on the stadium itself, right?

673
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:24,043
Scott: you know.

674
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:36,220
Scott: and in the commercials in between and Over the audio and on the big video Tron and such but the game itself, you know I mean they didn't even add instant replay to baseball, right?

675
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,849
Scott: They're just so devoid of technology or anything modern, right?

676
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,616
Rym: I remember the first time I went to a baseball game.

677
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:56,354
Rym: I was like Surprised to the point of befuddlement that they didn't pipe any announcers or anything over speakers That it was just quiet Like I was sitting there with my parents and I was waiting for the baseball game to start.

678
00:40:56,695 --> 00:41:00,371
Rym: and I'm waiting for like the announcer He's listening on the radio or TV like well, they do.

679
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:04,640
Scott: they do say things over the announcement But they don't say the whole game over it.

680
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,856
Scott: They're just like, you know now up so-and-so so it's just.

681
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:08,640
Rym: it was really quiet.

682
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:13,792
Rym: I'm sitting there and then it didn't happen and Baseball felt really weird and hollow without having the announcer just.

683
00:41:14,294 --> 00:41:18,774
Rym: and number 26 is up and he's having a big Hockey doesn't have a guy talking.

684
00:41:18,874 --> 00:41:23,360
Scott: hockey doesn't need it All right in football right football basically after every play, right?

685
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,805
Scott: The guy will say what the play was.

686
00:41:24,886 --> 00:41:29,618
Scott: if you like, you know, so-and-so pass to so-and-so Ten yards.

687
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:35,220
Rym: Football gets points for the fact that the ref will come out and explain the rule and why that's the ref.

688
00:41:35,321 --> 00:41:42,960
Rym: I'm talking about the announcer But I like that that the rough go up there like so and so did such-and-such and according to this rule blah blah blah.

689
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,787
Rym: Ten yard penalty first down.

690
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:45,008
Rym: Yeah.

691
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:51,220
Scott: Well, I mean the umpire in baseball is saying those those things But he doesn't have a microphone so you can't hear him unless you're really close.

692
00:41:51,401 --> 00:41:55,160
Scott: Yeah, you just have to watch his you know, he doesn't you know, you just have to watch his hands, you know.

693
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:02,320
Rym: Look at the scoreboard, I like sports announcers a lot, especially because every sport has its own kind of announce.

694
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,940
Scott: I mean I could do a whole take it to a whole show just about sports announcers in general.

695
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:14,797
Scott: But it's like we're constantly, you know, it's a big thing, especially like, you know my family We talk about like the sports announcers and like, you know, who's better and who sucks.

696
00:42:14,878 --> 00:42:19,420
Scott: and you know An old guy retires and they get some new guy and it's like oh fuck this new guy, you know.

697
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:24,640
Scott: Or it's like one guy who used to announce the Rangers games went to like become an owner or a coach somewhere.

698
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:32,490
Scott: It's like well fuck, you know now who's announcing this game and you know They'll always whenever there's a game on it's like oh who's doing the announcement, you know Is it someone good?

699
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,520
Scott: or should we turn on the radio?

700
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:50,319
Scott: but if you turn on the radio while you watch a game is a big delay and they actually have these people like setting things Up so that they can like delay the radio which is faster than the television so that the radio announcing lines up with the video they're watching because they like the radio announcer better than the TV one and it's like you'll.

701
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,715
Scott: you'll hope That your favorite game is on like a different channel because they have better announcers than the.

702
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:55,599
Scott: you know.

703
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:04,747
Scott: but I mean it's like all the it seems really seems like all the great announcers were from like a few decades ago and Sort of in more recent years.

704
00:43:04,827 --> 00:43:11,475
Scott: a lot of those guys just been dying retiring Nostalgia, it's hard to say well it is but it's.

705
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:18,039
Scott: you know, it's like Earlier in my life, you know in the 80s in the early 90s, you know, the announcers were just always great.

706
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,900
Scott: No one complained about them and just everything was like ah, you know, did they really without the internet?

707
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,983
Rym: How could you know?

708
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:26,953
Scott: Well, no, but like no one that you know, I knew.

709
00:43:27,054 --> 00:43:29,844
Scott: but like nowadays it's like, you know Who's announcing this game?

710
00:43:29,864 --> 00:43:31,028
Scott: Oh, he sucks.

711
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:31,932
Rym: I don't know that.

712
00:43:32,173 --> 00:43:33,800
Rym: I think that's mostly perception.

713
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,646
Scott: Well, it's it's somewhat perception.

714
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:37,733
Rym: At least hockey I feel has been pretty consistent.

715
00:43:37,773 --> 00:43:38,817
Rym: every time I listen to hockey.

716
00:43:38,837 --> 00:43:47,760
Scott: It's always that Yeah, but it you know, sometimes the guy doesn't have the right voice.

717
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:52,053
Rym: You know, yeah There's Detroit at a whiny guy for a while because the good guy was sick.

718
00:43:52,274 --> 00:43:59,509
Scott: like there's some guys who have the right they have The skill at it, you know, they're calling it properly, you know They but they they're just voice is not pleasant to listen to.

719
00:43:59,649 --> 00:44:04,926
Rym: soccer games were so unruly that royal bands were often put in place against the playing of such sports.

720
00:44:05,669 --> 00:44:11,909
Rym: on the 13th of April in 1314 King Edward the second of England issued What is believed to be the first royal decree?

721
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:20,680
Rym: He prohibited the quote hustling over large balls Unquote because of the impact the sport had on local merchants.

722
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:27,690
Scott: How did you escape this royal edict?

723
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:30,100
Scott: you hustle over large balls every day.

724
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:33,819
Rym: Well, I mean, I think I've got the biggest balls of them all.

725
00:44:34,701 --> 00:44:38,180
Scott: question that Your hustling is gonna get you in trouble.

726
00:44:39,582 --> 00:44:42,880
Rym: The sport was considered to be unchristian for its lack of order.

727
00:44:43,504 --> 00:44:47,563
Scott: Well hustling over balls is most decidedly Large ball.

728
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,008
Rym: So had the ball been small enough.

729
00:44:49,028 --> 00:44:50,172
Rym: We would have been just dandy.

730
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:52,619
Scott: Oh, then Christians are totally okay.

731
00:44:53,703 --> 00:44:54,553
Scott: Jews gotta watch out.

732
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,231
Scott: So baseball He's ball doesn't have very big balls shows going.

733
00:45:01,271 --> 00:45:03,280
Scott: No, no, I think I think we're done.

734
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,986
Rym: I'll show it all I remember as a kid.

735
00:45:05,026 --> 00:45:15,080
Rym: The other thing I remember the first time I got hit with a baseball I was playing baseball with my friends and I just got hit in the forehead with a line drive And I was like I got up and I'm like, oh, yeah.

736
00:45:16,301 --> 00:45:18,892
Rym: And then later I was like dad, let's play softball next time.

737
00:45:18,913 --> 00:45:20,540
Rym: He was like white softballs for voices.

738
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,925
Rym: No, but I want to lay softballs.

739
00:45:21,945 --> 00:45:22,608
Rym: He was like fine.

740
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:27,024
Rym: So, you know, we got to play catch and he's like, alright Here's your softball MIT.

741
00:45:27,646 --> 00:45:30,977
Rym: and he threw the softball at me and I was amazed that it was not softer.

742
00:45:31,077 --> 00:45:31,980
Rym: But in fact harder.

743
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,486
Scott: Yeah, it's just bigger.

744
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:34,751
Scott: No bigger and harder.

745
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:36,598
Scott: I do have one little baseball anecdote.

746
00:45:36,638 --> 00:45:37,120
Scott: I want to share.

747
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,566
Scott: It's not so exciting, but it is.

748
00:45:38,586 --> 00:45:39,852
Rym: Alright, I got one too.

749
00:45:39,932 --> 00:45:41,840
Scott: So but it is it is sort of informative, right?

750
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:43,203
Scott: So I went.

751
00:45:43,664 --> 00:45:54,628
Scott: I've been a camp counselor at summer camps many many times, right and But most of the camps I was a camp counselor at were sort of, you know, normal-ish day camp, you know Not so excel, you know nerdy camp whatever.

752
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:59,729
Scott: but in between freshman and sophomore years at RIT I was at a summer camp.

753
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:04,971
Scott: That was a sleep-away camp that had a lot of sports going on Right, and there was a lot of baseball playing going on.

754
00:46:05,112 --> 00:46:15,140
Scott: and during one part of the eight weeks There was they had like a baseball scout come and you know, it's sort of a guy who was really you know He's like a minor league player, you know, and they came and hung out at the camp for a little while.

755
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:18,639
Scott: so there was sort of like a lot of extra baseball activity going on right.

756
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:22,280
Scott: and You know, you see some people throw a baseball, right?

757
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:30,760
Scott: It's like I've always been able to throw, you know as in I rotate my arm I let go of the ball the ball actually makes it to where I want to make it to right?

758
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,450
Scott: It doesn't just drop on the ground.

759
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,960
Scott: It's amazing or go off to the side.

760
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:37,459
Rym: You can always tell there are people who know how to throw a ball and people who don't.

761
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:43,100
Scott: well There's actually there's three levels of throwing right and the first level of throwing is sort of like the oops.

762
00:46:43,421 --> 00:46:47,620
Scott: It goes on the ground sort of like beginning of the sandlot right where a kid doesn't know how to throw.

763
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:53,465
Scott: Then there's the sort of the level of throwing that I had at the time which is you know I'm gonna throw the ball.

764
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:54,369
Scott: You're gonna get it.

765
00:46:54,469 --> 00:46:56,859
Scott: It's gonna take a while to get there right, but you'll get it.

766
00:46:57,101 --> 00:46:58,636
Scott: It goes where I want it to go, right?

767
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:07,200
Scott: There's a third level of throwing where like the ball goes, you know Whoosh and when it hits the other guy's glove it goes like crack, you know, it's like damn.

768
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:07,782
Scott: How does he?

769
00:47:07,822 --> 00:47:10,994
Scott: you know the guy throws like exactly straight like a bullet you're out of a gun.

770
00:47:11,556 --> 00:47:22,228
Scott: and it was like, you know I like I you know I thought that the way to throw it like that was just have a really strong fucking arm and I didn't have a strong fucking Arm, so I was never able to throw like that.

771
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:31,640
Scott: and actually those Scout that Scout and that other dude Right taught all the kids, you know to throw that way and I also happen to be there.

772
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,220
Scott: And since I didn't have to counsel because these guys were taking care of the kids, right?

773
00:47:35,743 --> 00:48:17,856
Scott: I basically, you know through with the other counselor and Like I was actually paying close attention to what they were saying and I was like, oh shit And like I actually learned how to throw a baseball like incredibly properly and it's sort of you know Once you actually do it successfully and you hear you like you watch the ball like go stupid fast And you hits the other guy's glove and makes that incredibly loud noise it's like oh man, you just you just want to do it like a hundred times cuz it's like It's sort of really empowering that even though you're not so strong you've learned this relatively simple technique that has allowed you to throw this thing incredibly quickly and incredibly dangerously and incredibly accurately and It just like I was.

774
00:48:18,036 --> 00:48:24,448
Scott: I learned how to do it in like literally like 15 minutes just from listening to what these guys were saying actually paying attention and actually doing it.

775
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:31,210
Scott: and And I can't tell you exactly all the you know, I can't describe it to you what to do over the air.

776
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:39,862
Scott: You know, I'm just talking I'd have to show you but it's all wrist action, which I have plenty of You really like.

777
00:48:39,942 --> 00:48:44,190
Scott: you could have like no You have like no biceps whatsoever.

778
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,088
Rym: it's all about.

779
00:48:48,231 --> 00:48:51,746
Scott: It's all about snapping your wrist and then releasing at the correct moment.

780
00:48:51,987 --> 00:48:52,549
Scott: that is the.

781
00:48:53,495 --> 00:48:55,669
Scott: That is the way to throw a baseball really hard.

782
00:48:55,951 --> 00:49:00,699
Rym: Do something else - yeah No, you just so.

783
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:02,650
Rym: I believe Richard Linden knows all about it.

784
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:03,031
Rym: If you

785
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:20,856
Scott: if you've seen, you know, if you know what I'm talking about, and you've never actually thrown a baseball You know properly in quotes, you know If you ever, you know have the chance to practice and learn how to do it I highly recommend it because it's it's it's well worth it and it will help you in Any time you have to throw something.

786
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:24,470
Scott: perhaps you might have to throw a rock one day or something, you know snowball.

787
00:49:25,078 --> 00:49:25,969
Scott: Use the same technique.

788
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:28,276
Rym: You know, I'm feeling free to be.

789
00:49:28,336 --> 00:49:31,347
Scott: also it's very similar to frisbee throwing only with a frisbee.

790
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:36,467
Scott: you rotate your wrist You know in your arm or you know laterally as opposed to over the top.

791
00:49:36,588 --> 00:49:40,287
Rym: last year We tried to get to crew the crew together to play some kickball.

792
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:40,890
Rym: that didn't work out.

793
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,999
Scott: So we didn't have enough people and people was that people bailed.

794
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:45,283
Scott: people didn't play seriously.

795
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:47,369
Rym: I really want to play baseball.

796
00:49:47,409 --> 00:49:50,871
Rym: now I sound like I have this powerful burning urge, you know I would.

797
00:49:51,053 --> 00:49:53,389
Scott: there's a lot of sports leagues in the city and I'd like.

798
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:55,984
Scott: you know I did softball with my work a little bit.

799
00:49:56,064 --> 00:49:57,110
Rym: I don't want to play leagues though.

800
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,561
Rym: I want to play just like bumming around with friends in the park.

801
00:49:59,601 --> 00:50:05,243
Scott: Like I see I want to play leagues Because you know the seriousness and actually keeping score and actually mattering.

802
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:08,476
Rym: when I when I bummed around in high school We were just friends hanging out.

803
00:50:08,536 --> 00:50:10,504
Rym: We had different teams every time but we kept scoring.

804
00:50:10,605 --> 00:50:11,890
Rym: everyone played deadly serious.

805
00:50:12,073 --> 00:50:17,024
Scott: No, see that's you know, that's fine but with a league it's like you can play against different people all the time and you can.

806
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:20,530
Scott: actually you need less friends because you Only need enough friends for one team not two teams.

807
00:50:21,214 --> 00:50:24,190
Scott: So it's it's kind of fun and then you could actually win something.

808
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:26,985
Rym: Well, if we got the whole crew together, we could play a game of baseball.

809
00:50:27,085 --> 00:50:30,010
Scott: and you actually you know There's also a huge social aspect to the leagues.

810
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:35,247
Scott: I know there's like a there's a dodgeball thing around the corner for my work and if I lived in the city, I would totally do it.

811
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:47,090
Scott: but Because you know right if I did it now I basically would get home at stupid late hours or not at all because you know It runs late and but you know after the dodgeball everyone totally hangs out and it's totally cool.

812
00:50:47,553 --> 00:50:49,989
Scott: So it you know, that's that's what those things are all about.

813
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,522
Rym: But anyway, the show kind of went nowhere.

814
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:59,529
Scott: I think that's why we we were able You know, it wasn't the greatest idea for a show ever, but we were able to to knock one off.

815
00:51:01,474 --> 00:51:12,481
