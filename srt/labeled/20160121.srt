1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,690
Rym: So, when Emily and I saw Star Wars, we went and saw it at the 84th Street AMC, which is the only theater in New York.

2
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:21,957
Rym: Of all the theaters I go to in New York, unless it's a weird movie, that's the only one I'll actually go to for a new movie.

3
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:26,723
Rym: because assigned seating, which I know you European listeners are like, "Why is that

4
00:00:26,784 --> 00:00:27,128
Rym: special?".

5
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:30,168
Rym: That's not the usual way theaters work in the US.

6
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:37,830
Rym: We basically just showed up a minute before it was going to start, sat down in our recliners, and watched the movie.

7
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:42,850
Scott: The way movie theaters in the US have worked has changed many, many times over the course of history.

8
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,150
Rym: Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,050
Rym: If you want to go back to the old fantasy days.

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,590
Scott: I mean, not even the old days.

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:55,750
Scott: If we had gone in New York to see Return of the Jedi in the early '80s and we were zero, or less negative, whatever, we would have gone to see in Times Square.

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,249
Scott: Right now in Times Square, there's the AMC, I don't know how many theaters are in there, like a zillion.

13
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,609
Rym: The AMC Tourist Theater.

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,650
Scott: It's like a multiplex of a zillion theaters all in this one crazy maze above Dave & Buster's or whatever.

15
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:08,089
Scott: You know what used to be there?

16
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,930
Scott: One really big fucking theater, like Radio City Music Hall big, where they had thousands of seats.

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,510
Rym: That's the kind of place where there's a Panavision 70 millimeter screen going all the way across.

18
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:26,110
Scott: Radio City Music Hall is the only place that's still like that, where it's really long and has four tiers and it seats thousands of people in it.

19
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:31,150
Scott: They have a movie screen in there because I've seen them use it, but they don't really show movies there anymore.

20
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:36,269
Scott: I'm sure if you had enough money to rent the place out, you could watch Star Wars and Radio City Music Hall.

21
00:01:36,774 --> 00:01:38,390
Scott: But that's how it used to be, right?

22
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:45,310
Scott: The multiplex is actually an invention early in our lives where you would have more than like two screens in one place.

23
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,250
Scott: It used to be the kind of theaters where there would be two movies showing.

24
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,168
Rym: Yeah, well because two movies came out.

25
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:51,739
Rym: Right.

26
00:01:51,990 --> 00:02:04,369
Scott: There would be two movies at a time at the theater and you'd have one of those sort of big neon light kind of things out, marquees out front with two movies listed on one on each side, one for theater one and one for theater two.

27
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:08,990
Scott: And the multiplex is a new thing and now the multiplex is going away.

28
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:18,130
Scott: So it's like, yeah, every like 20 something years or so, the way, you know, movie theaters are, you know, designed and made is it changes drastically.

29
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:21,710
Scott: It's not, you know, people think like, oh my God, it's always been a multiplex.

30
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:22,387
Scott: It's like, no, it's not.

31
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,588
Scott: That's less old than me, the multiplex.

32
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:25,472
Rym: But there is.

33
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:31,624
Rym: so we said we said we sat down and there was an Italian family to the left of us.

34
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:33,130
Rym: I'm pretty sure they were Italian.

35
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,730
Rym: That's kind of what the language sounded like.

36
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,715
Scott: It's that they're

37
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:38,149
Rym: going back and forth between Italian and English and they're being

38
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:39,800
Scott: kind of rowdy, but I made it to meet the ball, but

39
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:46,849
Rym: it's during the trailers like it's fine because the Kung Fu Panda three trailer happened and at the end of it, you know, the guys like, I think I peed a little.

40
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:48,530
Rym: So the next trailer was shitty.

41
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,409
Rym: I forget what movie it was.

42
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:54,846
Rym: So the trailer like fades out and I just go, I think I peed a little and they laughed real hard at that.

43
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:57,629
Rym: So it was all cool.

44
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:13,823
Rym: But then right before the movie is actually about to start, one of the old ladies suddenly gets up and has to pee and then she stumbles back into the theater like just as Star Wars is starting and can't find her seat again and starts yelling for her relatives to find them.

45
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:29,809
Rym: And they start yelling back at her and then she walks over and they sit down and they just start yelling and talking for more than a minute before I, because apparently no one else had the balls to say, yeah, I turn around, I'm like, shut up.

46
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:36,729
Rym: And they look at me and they keep talking for a second and I kind of give them the stink eye again and then they got quiet.

47
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:43,488
Rym: But then like 10 minutes later, one of them was quietly explaining the plot of star Wars to one of the old people.

48
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:48,009
Rym: But then the movie got loud and I could drown them out and there was a family in front of us to the right.

49
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:50,601
Rym: They brought a kid who was too young to even understand.

50
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:56,450
Rym: he was at a movie and he basically spent the movie running up and down in the aisle and like rolling around on the floor.

51
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,870
Scott: It was such a great experience in that, uh, in that expensive assigned city movie theater.

52
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:04,250
Rym: That shit happens almost every theater, but at least I was in a recliner.

53
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:12,629
Scott: I saw it in a regular plex in Connecticut and on Christmas day and there was only normal people there, you know, and it was just fine.

54
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,810
Rym: I think it was, it might've been the Christmas factor.

55
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:15,410
Rym: You know what?

56
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,469
Scott: It cost me eight bucks.

57
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:17,389
Rym: Oh yeah.

58
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:17,841
Rym: Yeah.

59
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,765
Rym: Actually I think we only paid like 20 bucks.

60
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:25,330
Scott: So I paid eight bucks times for three, four people, right?

61
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,348
Scott: Versus 20 times three, four people.

62
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:28,469
Scott: That is a week.

63
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,710
Scott: I was with popcorn.

64
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,990
Scott: I paid less than you pay.

65
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,310
Rym: Whoa, you got popcorn.

66
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,509
Scott: It was so cheap busting it out.

67
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:35,647
Scott: It was so cheap.

68
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,649
Rym: You got a free refill, but I don't have much of a news.

69
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,190
Rym: So I guess to continue this opening that, you know, Scott decided I had a news in the thing of the day and Scott was like, no star Wars only.

70
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:46,450
Scott: I had a star Wars news and star Wars thing of the day.

71
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,649
Scott: So Rym has to do the same thing.

72
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:48,790
Scott: So at least it's star Wars.

73
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,270
Scott: It is the single biggest nerd thing in the universe.

74
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,408
Scott: And you should be able to do a news and thing of the day for star Wars every single day of the week.

75
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:06,109
Scott: There is that much star Wars out there, especially because there's a star Wars only podcast somewhere and they could record every goddamn day if they wanted to from now until the rest of our lives.

76
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,241
Scott: Yeah.

77
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,136
Rym: I mean, we're only going to talk about Star Wars occasionally, right?

78
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,290
Scott: We can definitely do a full Star Wars episode anytime we need.

79
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,451
Rym: We only did, we only talked about Star Wars once ever on GeekNights and that was in 2005.

80
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:21,257
Scott: It's the biggest, most important nerd thing.

81
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:22,260
Scott: there is 2005 episode called Star Wars.

82
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,749
Scott: I guess we're not talking about Star Wars enough.

83
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:32,208
Scott: Uh, yeah, especially because, uh, I mean, I'm sure we've talked about like tie fighter and shit too many times.

84
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:40,849
Rym: Moderately fresh in my memory is how fucking pumped I was when I heard episode one was going to happen.

85
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:46,664
Rym: And I've like pirated that soundtrack that spoiled Qui-Gon's death like way before the movie.

86
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:53,730
Scott: I was just pumped by the, uh, you know, the, the original trailer, which is at the time or perhaps still the most downloaded thing ever.

87
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,389
Rym: Oh my God.

88
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,330
Rym: Cause I, it took me a minute to even grok the fact that, wait, they're going to make another star Wars movie.

89
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,030
Rym: That's the kind of thing that I just assumed was never going to happen in my life.

90
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,570
Scott: I assumed it was going to happen once they made those special edition, but they made special edition when I was a kid.

91
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:17,286
Rym: And one of my Christmas gifts, I remember my brother and I both got a reference copy of the star Wars trilogy because that one, the VHS and everyone had that one.

92
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,427
Scott: That's the real one.

93
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:19,908
Scott: Yeah.

94
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,764
Scott: The only people who don't have that one are rich people at laser disc, which is the real, real one.

95
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,946
Rym: I still have that one.

96
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:30,390
Rym: Uh, so does everyone else, I don't think it's even been open because we watched other copies of star.

97
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,770
Rym: We had like five copies of Star Wars.

98
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,208
Scott: Get a good VCR just still work.

99
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:43,470
Rym: But I, the, the graph of how excited I was about episode one was just an upward and ever upward line until about 10 minutes into the movie.

100
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:44,770
Rym: And then we all know what happened.

101
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:47,990
Rym: So I approached this new star Wars with cautious optimism.

102
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,789
Rym: But before we talk about the new star Wars, it's time to talk about star Wars news.

103
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,569
Rym: You got a star Wars news.

104
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:53,942
Scott: Yeah, I do.

105
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:56,830
Scott: So, uh, there's fantasy flight games.

106
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,286
Scott: They're the people who publish net runner and they're not the greatest game publisher on earth.

107
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:10,490
Scott: Uh, honestly speaking, if you look at the history of games that they have published games that they have published that are made by other people that they're just publishing tend to be pretty good.

108
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,590
Scott: Like they published T and E now, right?

109
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,809
Scott: They didn't originally publish it in English, but they do it now.

110
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:18,450
Scott: Uh, they published net runner also a game that they didn't make originally.

111
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:18,887
Scott: Right.

112
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,750
Scott: But games that they have made them, they'll publish citadels.

113
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,608
Scott: That's another good one.

114
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:22,982
Scott: Right.

115
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:33,990
Scott: But games that they publish that they make, you know, that people at fantasy flight have made entirely employees have designed, have not been the kind of games that I enjoy.

116
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,629
Scott: They're usually not so good.

117
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:42,250
Scott: And this company also has the rights to make star Wars board games in the United States of America.

118
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:48,565
Scott: So that includes the X-wing miniatures game, Armada, the role play, star Wars role playing games.

119
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:55,930
Scott: Uh, they have this Imperial assault, which is like descent, the board game, but star Wars or hero quest, the board game, but star Wars, right?

120
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,610
Scott: You move, you know, your jetties around and you'd stab stormtroopers.

121
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,170
Rym: I mean, that's a real mixed bag, but a lot of star Wars in right.

122
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:09,450
Scott: They make every star Wars tabletop game, uh, since they got the license and currently, right, they have exclusive rights.

123
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,449
Scott: No one else is allowed to make a star Wars tabletop game in the United States, except for them.

124
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:15,530
Scott: They have an exclusive license.

125
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:19,870
Scott: So they are making a game that is called star Wars rebellion.

126
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:26,950
Scott: Now this game all week, this week, we've known this game has been coming for a while, but, uh, and we've known that it's a big box.

127
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:34,630
Scott: It's going to cost like a hundred bucks and we've known sort of what it looks like, but we didn't know anything about the game itself until this week.

128
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,830
Scott: They're publishing every day.

129
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,789
Scott: This week they published an update on their site talking about really specific details about how the game plays out.

130
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:50,602
Scott: And it sounds like a real fantasy flight kind of game, which means it probably won't like it, but it it's like the only game ever that sort of.

131
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:58,010
Scott: lets you play one V one sort of like the entire empire versus rebellion conflict across the galaxy.

132
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:05,228
Rym: I feel like I'm going to enjoy it as much as I liked battle lore as in, uh, no, I think it'll be better than battle lore for sure.

133
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,169
Rym: Well, I did like, I enjoyed a lot of battle lore, but I also could not deal with a lot of battle lore.

134
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:14,889
Rym: So it's like a real strong, positive, real strong, negative balancing zero.

135
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:23,530
Scott: This is a game where like, this is a game where you can expect to do things like play mission cards that say like, you know, find the plans for the death star.

136
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:29,269
Scott: So then you send Leia to a planet to search for the plans and roll some dice to see if you succeed or fail.

137
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:41,290
Scott: And then, you know, you just keep the plan, have a death star, like a weird, this is a game where you'll have a superstar destroyer with a bunch of tie fighters and ATATs in it and you'll move it to another planet and then land things on the planet.

138
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:42,470
Rym: Right.

139
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:50,190
Scott: And then you'll have a ground combat and then you'll have a space combat and you could win the space combat and lose the ground combat, you know, and then what happens?

140
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,930
Scott: You mean you can't, I guess there's no bombing, at least they didn't say any rules about bombing or anything.

141
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,058
Scott: Right.

142
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,190
Scott: But it's basically, and it's a game, it's an asymmetric game, right?

143
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,790
Scott: The empire is trying to find the rebel base and blow it up.

144
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,149
Scott: The rebels are trying to complete a bunch of missions.

145
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:07,409
Scott: If you get the death star into a system, you can roll dice and just blow it the fuck up.

146
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:08,530
Scott: Right.

147
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:15,530
Scott: So, but you know, the rebels can like get a really risky role, but if they succeed, they blow up the death star because that's star wars, right?

148
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:23,690
Scott: You know, so it's, it's one of those games where the, the theme really, really, really matches the mechanics, but perhaps the mechanics may or may not make a good game.

149
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:28,709
Scott: I'm hoping to play this at a convention before I spend any money or time on it.

150
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:30,669
Rym: Luckily, that's the kind of thing we can do.

151
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,790
Rym: We have so many packs is that probably like right after it comes out the next pack.

152
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:41,270
Scott: Because the good aspect of this game is that a, it's star wars, B it's got lots of little star wars miniatures in it, right?

153
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,330
Scott: Like star destroyers and shit.

154
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:52,170
Scott: But it's a two player game that is like a, you know, big crunchy enough competitive game, but isn't like some sprawling war game that takes you a hundred years, right?

155
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,389
Scott: You could probably play this again, someone in a reasonable number of hours.

156
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,930
Rym: The danger might be, it's one of those games that you might play a little bit and then it's played out, but it was real fun while you were playing.

157
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:08,609
Scott: But I mean, for example, if I was in high school, you know, rather than playing two player risk with my brother, this would have been like 10 million times better no matter how bad it is.

158
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,350
Rym: You know, sort of thing with gamers.

159
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:24,769
Rym: This is more Tuesday talk for GeekNights, but there is a place for those games that are not great from the perspective of people like us who have played every game in the world because we grew up with, you know, X's and allies was as good as we could get and that is not a good game.

160
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:38,230
Rym: So if the level, if this kind of game is the level that kids like us get before they find out about real big boy games, yeah, high school kids are able to get this and play one on one with their siblings or whatever.

161
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:38,590
Scott: Right.

162
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,530
Scott: Or, you know, parents can get this and play one on one with their kids who are like early teens or teenagers, whatever.

163
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,709
Scott: That's this could be, you know, this is good stuff.

164
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:46,490
Scott: Star Wars.

165
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,889
Scott: So you can get more, get people to play it more easily with you.

166
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,110
Scott: Right.

167
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:50,730
Scott: You bring out your Krusty War game.

168
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:53,410
Scott: You know, it's like your kids not going to play advanced quad leader.

169
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:54,770
Scott: It's not happening.

170
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,949
Rym: The danger of that is there's those games like the Ghostbusters Kickstarter game.

171
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:01,250
Rym: that would turn kids off to both games and Ghostbusters forever.

172
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:01,708
Scott: Sure.

173
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,130
Scott: But I mean, you know, Imperial Assault is still better than Hero Quest.

174
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,149
Rym: So that gem movie didn't open very well, as you guys know.

175
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:09,869
Scott: You don't say.

176
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,030
Rym: I mean, I talked a lot about how poorly that movie opened, but it did so much worse.

177
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,037
Scott: They're making a gem.

178
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:16,190
Scott: comic book I heard is good.

179
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,029
Rym: Apparently it's great.

180
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,369
Scott: Better than that movie.

181
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,330
Rym: So, so this is relevant to Star Wars.

182
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,705
Rym: So Star Wars global, the release of Star Wars gross like 1.8 billion worldwide.

183
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:28,650
Scott: Yeah.

184
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,588
Scott: And that doesn't count merch.

185
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:30,230
Rym: Yeah.

186
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,750
Rym: How much do you think the gem movie grossed in the international release?

187
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,335
Rym: Like after the U S release?

188
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:40,150
Rym: zero, not zero, a thousand, $142,000.

189
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,276
Scott: That's still more money than I have in previews.

190
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:49,130
Rym: in the U S it averaged $36 per theater, $36 per theater.

191
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:49,708
Scott: Yep.

192
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:57,268
Rym: So star Wars had one, like the third or fourth biggest opening in cinematic history, the new star Wars episode seven.

193
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:12,230
Rym: And likely as a result of that success, because it was around Christmas, they have pushed episode eight from a summer blockbuster release to go out at about the same time as episode seven did around Christmas.

194
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,290
Scott: I was actually surprised.

195
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:22,170
Scott: I had assumed right without knowing that episode eight was going to be out of holidays, Christmas time, 2016.

196
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,632
Scott: And then someone told me, no, no, no, it's going to be like spring, summer, 2017.

197
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:26,670
Scott: And I'm like, why would they do that?

198
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,350
Scott: Why wouldn't you just make it always holidays?

199
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,869
Scott: That makes no sense to me.

200
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,429
Rym: And apparently they took a big risk.

201
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,410
Scott: But 2017 it's like, I guess they're taking time on it.

202
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,150
Scott: I guess, you know, I thought they'd be like editing and polishing at this point.

203
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,990
Rym: So the rumor mill at first like, Oh, there must be delays in production.

204
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:51,370
Rym: But then the more reliable rumor mill basically said, no, they just think the holidays is actually like a really good place to put star Wars going forward.

205
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:53,610
Scott: I thought that's what it was going to be.

206
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,968
Scott: So it's like it wasn't even delayed for me because I assumed it was delayed by exactly one year for me.

207
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,690
Rym: You know what this is?

208
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,949
Rym: This is an example of the cost of knowledge.

209
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,470
Rym: People who had more knowledge than us because they paid that much more attention just got real disappointed.

210
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,169
Scott: But I don't give a crap.

211
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,889
Scott: What's my hurry?

212
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:11,970
Scott: I would be disappointed if you're going to live to see it or you're not.

213
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,283
Rym: Yeah.

214
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:21,410
Rym: So what if when I'm like 89 years old, they announced like the culture movie trilogy and movie three is going to come out three years from now.

215
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,809
Rym: I don't know if I'm going to make it three years.

216
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:28,568
Scott: Well, you know, they're always doing stuff like showing a Pixar movies to kids who have like cancer and aren't going to make it.

217
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,348
Rym: I guess that's my only hope.

218
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,010
Scott: Your only hope.

219
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:43,770
Rym: So someone pointed out that this puts it right before Avatar two, to which I responded Avatar to the blue one with the blue people, the blue people are making a second blue.

220
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:45,689
Rym: I didn't know that was happening.

221
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:46,910
Rym: I still don't actually.

222
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:47,970
Scott: I didn't know that was happening.

223
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:48,629
Scott: And you know what I found?

224
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,863
Scott: I don't know if I might have mentioned this in the show before.

225
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:56,370
Scott: I found out recently that like my one of my newer co-workers, he said that like he was a huge fan of that movie.

226
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,750
Scott: I didn't realize anyone was a huge fan of that movie.

227
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,790
Rym: The thing is blockbuster fantasy sci-fi action movies.

228
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:06,350
Rym: A lot of people end up being really huge fans of those things.

229
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:07,054
Rym: But those are.

230
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,150
Rym: that's not the demographic that gets normal merchandising.

231
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,670
Rym: That's the demographic that buys special editions and goes to see the sequels.

232
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:17,870
Rym: They're super fans, but they're not buying like action figures.

233
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,850
Scott: I didn't think that movie was sequel worthy anyway.

234
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:23,550
Scott: Well, I mean, most things aren't, but they get sequels and trequels.

235
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,430
Rym: Robocop was sequel worthy.

236
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,929
Rym: And yet we know what happened to that.

237
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,250
Scott: Oh, you know, Frank Miller.

238
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:28,684
Scott: He's a guy.

239
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,969
Rym: Yeah, that's a person.

240
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:31,810
Rym: Last night.

241
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,609
Scott: That's human being.

242
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,768
Rym: Last night, I just found the trailer to Robocop three.

243
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:42,050
Rym: And then we watched the opening 10 minutes of Robocop two.

244
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:43,686
Scott: Oh, no, no, no.

245
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:46,450
Scott: Why do you have time in your life?

246
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,609
Scott: Why are you spending it on that?

247
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:49,789
Rym: This sort of came up.

248
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:51,026
Rym: In the evening.

249
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,070
Scott: OK, you could have spent your time on many other things.

250
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,510
Rym: So it's like the bluebird in over the over the garden wall.

251
00:15:58,853 --> 00:15:59,570
Rym: I'm a bluebird.

252
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,630
Rym: We have short lifespans.

253
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,310
Rym: You are literally killing me right now.

254
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:02,829
Rym: That's right.

255
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:03,829
Scott: That's right.

256
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:04,727
Scott: We're all the bluebird.

257
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,790
Rym: Scott, as a total aside, we watch that.

258
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,150
Scott: Why are you listening to this GeekNights?

259
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,129
Scott: Seriously, bluebirds?

260
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,810
Scott: All you bluebirds listening out there.

261
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,457
Scott: What does that?

262
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:13,269
Rym: we watch that show?

263
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:14,370
Rym: It's on Hulu.

264
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:15,830
Rym: It's only 10 episodes.

265
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,168
Scott: I've seen like four of them.

266
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:18,330
Rym: Watch the rest of it.

267
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,090
Rym: It's crazy.

268
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,006
Scott: I've seen the end and I've seen like the middle of the end.

269
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,650
Scott: I saw because I saw random episodes that I remember.

270
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:26,829
Scott: I didn't know what it was.

271
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,690
Scott: There's Connecticut where I saw someone cosplaying or the red pointy hat.

272
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,770
Scott: And I was like, what the fuck is that?

273
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,588
Scott: And they said the no.

274
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,810
Rym: And you're like, no, no.

275
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,210
Scott: Then they said, no, it's over the garden wall.

276
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,070
Scott: It's some cartoon thing.

277
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:35,650
Scott: I'm like, OK.

278
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:38,089
Scott: And then I watched like one episode and I was like, all right.

279
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,330
Scott: And then I was home in Connecticut at some point.

280
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,830
Scott: My sister was there and it was like any on demand.

281
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,669
Scott: There was like some random episodes.

282
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:53,629
Scott: So I watched like one where they were at the old ladies creepy house and then one where the end where there was like the football team and shit.

283
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:54,277
Rym: Whoa.

284
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:55,007
Rym: OK, so.

285
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,910
Rym: So, you know, in the show, the football stuff that is never shown to you until the very end.

286
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,010
Scott: Yeah, I gathered that.

287
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,769
Scott: I'm not a moron.

288
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,010
Scott: Yeah, I could tell.

289
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:03,888
Rym: It's making sure.

290
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:04,226
Rym: Yeah.

291
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,209
Rym: So anyway, if you watch the show all the way through because it's short, it's basically like a movie.

292
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,490
Rym: But, uh, the bluebird is Scott, the girl bluebird.

293
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,730
Rym: Like that is you, the bluebird speaks the truth and is correct.

294
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:20,670
Rym: And yes, yeah, bluebird, bluebird, bluebird go.

295
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:22,410
Scott: I saw a bunch of bluebird stuff.

296
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:25,644
Scott: There's a lot when the bluebird trying to get her back to her nest and shit.

297
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:26,868
Scott: And she was like, oh, whatever.

298
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,820
Rym: But anyway, that was in Star Wars.

299
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,019
Rym: So things of the day, this might have been used at some point way in the past, but I don't think you've all seen it.

300
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:43,759
Rym: And I watched it again just now.

301
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:46,159
Rym: And it's way funny.

302
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,058
Scott: Rym thinks this is funnier than I do.

303
00:17:48,682 --> 00:17:51,280
Scott: I mean, it's not bad, but it's like I'm not so laughing at this.

304
00:17:51,521 --> 00:17:52,559
Rym: I'm still laughing at this.

305
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:58,039
Rym: Just thinking about it is funny to me because this is my, this is one of the kinds of humor that I really enjoy.

306
00:17:58,521 --> 00:18:02,440
Rym: But the moment that does it for me is how they edited.

307
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:09,480
Rym: They reversed Luke's face, like moving a little bit to make it look like you reacted to something in a certain way.

308
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:11,077
Rym: And that sells it to me.

309
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,318
Rym: Darth Vader feels the blues.

310
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,920
Scott: Okay.

311
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,354
Scott: My thing of the day is this, I just saw this today.

312
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:26,019
Scott: is this guy who was quite talented at the singing and the guitar in, and he does an acoustic cover of one of the best songs in all of star wars.

313
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,618
Scott: You have nub.

314
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,547
Rym: Oh, who did you hate this song?

315
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,536
Scott: You have no soul.

316
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:41,398
Rym: Oh, so, so Scott, I have someone actually the first YouTube comment here on my thing.

317
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:42,820
Rym: Someone had an idea.

318
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,180
Rym: I never thought of, they, they claim they did this.

319
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:53,500
Rym: I don't know if they actually did, you know, YouTube tell your family, Hey, let's marathon star wars, edit the last file.

320
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:58,358
Rym: So that scene is this instead of what actually happens in that part of star wars.

321
00:18:58,721 --> 00:18:59,278
Scott: Good luck with that.

322
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:01,920
Rym: That is a long time.

323
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,599
Scott: It's going to be problem because the, uh, that video file there on YouTube has a wrong aspect ratio.

324
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:09,438
Rym: You could fix that.

325
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,239
Scott: I'm just saying you're going to have to zoom in.

326
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,400
Scott: The resolution will be bad.

327
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,897
Rym: And you know, yeah, I think the resolution is going to be from a laser disc or VHS.

328
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,140
Rym: Anyway, maybe, well, you're going to watch the new ones.

329
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:32,179
Rym: No, I got my, uh, I got my, um, that one, uh, bit torrent that everyone got the, uh, the one that's the highest possible quality, the de-specialized it's the highest possible quality you can get of star wars from the available source.

330
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:32,680
Scott: That's right.

331
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,216
Scott: The real one.

332
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:35,340
Scott: Don't watch any other one in the meta moment.

333
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:38,719
Rym: Uh, we're going to be at PAX South, like next weekend.

334
00:19:40,126 --> 00:19:41,019
Scott: Whoa, escape the snow.

335
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,859
Scott: If we're a week too late to escape the snow last year, we escaped in the snow and then out to Arizona this weekend.

336
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,700
Scott: And then you're gonna go straight from Arizona to tejas.

337
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,538
Rym: I'm going to, I'm going to come back here.

338
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:49,923
Scott: Wow.

339
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,798
Rym: And then go to take what a bad move that I'm going from tejas straight to new Hampshire instead of going home.

340
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:55,500
Scott: Wow.

341
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:56,119
Scott: That's a bad move.

342
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:07,060
Rym: So packs Atari game design Saturday, 1130 scared yet a discussion of horror games moderated by Chris Straub of chainsaw suit and a bunch of other super smart people.

343
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,773
Rym: And then for some reason I'm on the panel Saturday, five 30.

344
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:14,400
Rym: Sunday, one PM designing game rules.

345
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,920
Rym: And then Sunday at a two Oh one PM I am running to the airport and flying in New Hampshire.

346
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:22,939
Scott: I'll be chilling in tejas.

347
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,819
Scott: I think until maybe the next day, let me check my, you're leaving in the morning and remember I'm leaving the next day.

348
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,660
Rym: This was, this is kind of an aside, but in the meta moment, I think I've booked more travel in hotels and car rentals.

349
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,954
Scott: Which day is February 1st?

350
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:36,239
Rym: I don't even know.

351
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,078
Rym: I think it's a Monday.

352
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,520
Scott: That's when I'm leaving.

353
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,738
Rym: I think you're leaving on the Monday.

354
00:20:40,162 --> 00:20:41,119
Rym: Yeah, you're leaving on the Monday.

355
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:41,699
Scott: All right, good.

356
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,325
Rym: Yeah.

357
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,820
Scott: So I'll be chilling in tejas.

358
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,598
Rym: I'm going to fly.

359
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:49,675
Rym: I'm going to land in Boston at like 11 because there just aren't direct flights to or from anywhere in Texas.

360
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:50,199
Rym: that matters.

361
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:50,860
Scott: Oh, that's right.

362
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,940
Scott: I'm leaving it like from leaving Friday at like six in the morning.

363
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:54,480
Scott: That was nice.

364
00:20:55,107 --> 00:20:55,840
Rym: Oh, that's the worst.

365
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,478
Scott: No, it's the best.

366
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,479
Scott: It means like it's in New York.

367
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,920
Scott: Like, I mean, Monday at six in the morning, I'll get, be able to actually spend my day in New York going.

368
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,200
Rym: Ah, it means you got to get up at like four in the morning though.

369
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:05,140
Scott: I did that last time.

370
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,980
Scott: It was actually pretty good.

371
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,280
Rym: Yeah, actually you mean Emily usually do that after pecs prime.

372
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:16,059
Rym: So what if, anyway, star Wars, uh, obviously, you know, we're going to just spoil it because you're a nerd.

373
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:18,520
Scott: You're a nerd and you're so nerdy.

374
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,560
Scott: You listen to the Ignite and you haven't seen, and there's a new star Wars movie.

375
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,800
Scott: The most important nerdy event that can possibly happen in the world of geeks.

376
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:29,059
Scott: And you still haven't seen it at this point.

377
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:30,518
Scott: What the fuck?

378
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,260
Rym: Meanwhile, I didn't actually see it until last weekend.

379
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:36,180
Rym: And yet somehow I avoided any spoilers or anything.

380
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:41,260
Rym: And I didn't like sequester myself away from the internet, but guys, spoilers.

381
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:54,060
Rym: Uh, I knew Han Solo was going to die immediately because this movie had a lot of, shall we say cinematic homage to episode four, I don't think, I think it was beyond homage to the point at which it was the same movie, like 75%.

382
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,460
Rym: It was the same movie structurally, but it had enough deviation to where.

383
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,380
Rym: I was very pleased with the result.

384
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,895
Rym: It's kind of like you knew where the journey was going, but the journey itself was fun because you didn't know what rest stops.

385
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:06,620
Rym: you hit along the way.

386
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,420
Scott: And pleased is a strong word.

387
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,619
Rym: I liked it a lot.

388
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:10,920
Scott: Uh, it was okay.

389
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,580
Rym: I put it like a hair below the original trilogy in terms of quality.

390
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,259
Rym: It's like episode five, episode four, episode six.

391
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:22,859
Rym: This is right behind episode six.

392
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:33,520
Scott: And it is infinitely ahead of episodes one, two, and three, which, uh, I mean, it's way ahead of episodes one, two, and three, but there's still a gap that, you know, quite a significant gap between four or five.

393
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,179
Rym: So what did you not like?

394
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,100
Scott: I think the main problem with this movie, right?

395
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:51,000
Scott: Is the same problem that I have with a lot of like TV shows that everyone seems to really like, but specifically is that, you know, the events that occur in this movie don't seem to have weight, right?

396
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:51,720
Rym: That is a complaint.

397
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:59,000
Scott: I will see when an entire star system gets destroyed by star killer in star Wars episode four, which is the same exact movie, right?

398
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,220
Scott: They're approaching the death star and it's like, that's no moon.

399
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:04,417
Scott: And you're like, oh shit, son.

400
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:04,800
Scott: Right.

401
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,380
Scott: In this movie, it's like, oh, by the way, this is giant star killer.

402
00:23:07,943 --> 00:23:09,159
Scott: Oh, by the way, there's the foot, right?

403
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,239
Scott: It's like, you can fucking move shit.

404
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,054
Scott: Holy crap.

405
00:23:12,095 --> 00:23:12,259
Scott: Right.

406
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,200
Scott: It's like the, the events like matter.

407
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,540
Scott: It's like, you know, at the very beginning of the movie, right?

408
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:20,500
Scott: It's like the, what happens at the beginning of any star Wars movie, a giant spaceship comes overhead, right?

409
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:25,958
Scott: So every single one, even episodes one, two, and three did a better job of this than episode seven.

410
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,526
Rym: Watch those again.

411
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:32,260
Scott: in the beginning, when the spaceship comes across, it comes from like the bottom and it's not that big.

412
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:32,999
Scott: And it's like, what?

413
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:43,380
Scott: And then, you know, episode four is like Darth Vader comes onto the ship and the camera moves from his feet up and it's like, oh, who is this motherfucker though?

414
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:43,661
Rym: Right.

415
00:23:43,842 --> 00:23:52,418
Rym: That at least for that aspect, the fact that Kylo Ren doesn't really have that weight really fits what he is because he's just a Darth Vader weeaboo.

416
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,580
Rym: That's exactly what he is, which makes him a great villain.

417
00:23:55,921 --> 00:24:01,959
Rym: But it means that he is like Darth Vader's skull had more screen presence than him, which was great.

418
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,119
Rym: Well, sealed that character for me.

419
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,060
Scott: I mean, yeah, it's sealed the character as shitty.

420
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,828
Scott: I don't care.

421
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:08,519
Scott: I don't like you.

422
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,496
Scott: I don't want to see you.

423
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:10,620
Rym: I like the character.

424
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:12,500
Scott: I don't like him as a character.

425
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,140
Scott: I think it's like it's an obvious, you know, it's like, yeah, OK, there's I can see what they're going for there.

426
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,560
Scott: It's the same thing that everyone else sees that they're going for.

427
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:20,802
Scott: Right.

428
00:24:20,822 --> 00:24:21,960
Scott: Is it Darth Vader weeaboo?

429
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:26,226
Scott: He's got, you know, parent problems and he's got, you know, his most anger issues.

430
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:29,140
Scott: and it's like, yeah, OK, I don't like him.

431
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,760
Scott: I want to be fucking Darth Vader.

432
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:33,680
Scott: I want Kylo Ren to die in a fire and I wouldn't shed a single tear.

433
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,260
Scott: I'd probably dance a happy dance like Jar Jar Binks died.

434
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,980
Rym: Yeah, people want to be Darth Vader.

435
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:39,600
Rym: You are Kylo Ren.

436
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,538
Scott: I'd rather be the emperor.

437
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,182
Scott: Right.

438
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:41,979
Scott: Emperor is way better.

439
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:43,759
Rym: Yeah, but he goes down like a chump.

440
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:44,826
Scott: It's fine.

441
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:46,340
Scott: That's the other thing, right?

442
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,160
Scott: It's like, you know, in Star Wars, it's like you have all this this mystery.

443
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:52,240
Scott: And it's like there's a fucking emperor here.

444
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,859
Scott: It's like, oh, there's some dude.

445
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,660
Scott: We know nothing about him and he's not cool.

446
00:24:56,623 --> 00:25:02,075
Rym: So I have a crazy like thinking about, you know, the Voldemort, like it's the hologram of that guy.

447
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:02,458
Rym: Yeah.

448
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:04,919
Rym: I don't think this is true.

449
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:08,259
Rym: But a younger me would be like, oh, I know what's going on.

450
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:12,460
Rym: If this is what's true, then these this trilogy is going to be amazing.

451
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:13,638
Rym: But I don't think it is.

452
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:19,759
Rym: The commander guy, the Grand Moff Tarkin replacement, who actually is competent.

453
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,533
Scott: Yeah, that's actually not a bad character.

454
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,059
Scott: I like that guy.

455
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,580
Rym: What if it's a Wizard of Oz and that guy is the Sith Lord and the hologram is just him fucking controlling everybody?

456
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,728
Scott: That would be fucking awesome.

457
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:30,960
Rym: Because it could it could work.

458
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,807
Rym: Nothing is said.

459
00:25:31,868 --> 00:25:33,000
Rym: That is not what is happening.

460
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,778
Rym: And the fact that it's a hologram actually lends credence to it.

461
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:39,620
Rym: I don't think that's what they're going to do, because that's kind of crazy.

462
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:43,760
Rym: But at the same time, holy crap, if it is because I like that character a lot.

463
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,475
Rym: And Grand Moff Tarkin is actually one of my favorite characters in all of Star Wars, partly because the acting.

464
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:49,019
Rym: I mean, that guy.

465
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:59,099
Scott: I mean, the thing that, you know, one of the number one things that makes Star Wars so awesome is that the Emperor, despite being bad guys, that must lose is so bad ass.

466
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,760
Scott: Right in this Star Wars episodes, even in Star Wars episodes one, two and three.

467
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:07,539
Scott: The Empire was well, not one so much, but at least two and three.

468
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,837
Scott: The Empire was still bad ass.

469
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:13,240
Scott: Well, the Empire seven in episode seven.

470
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,700
Scott: They are chintzy garbage in episode seven.

471
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,040
Rym: It is clear that the Senate and the resistance are both chumps.

472
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,192
Rym: They both suck.

473
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:23,679
Rym: And guess what?

474
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:26,280
Rym: They both got basically destroyed immediately.

475
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,201
Rym: Right.

476
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:28,740
Scott: And the Empire is also chumps.

477
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,720
Scott: There's no because Darth Vader is gone and the Empire is gone.

478
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,900
Scott: There is no bad asses left.

479
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,939
Scott: You know, like Poe is the only bad ass left in the galaxy.

480
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,738
Scott: There is no one else.

481
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,451
Rym: Yeah, we even lost Han Solo.

482
00:26:41,491 --> 00:26:42,460
Rym: So it's just it's Poe.

483
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:44,118
Scott: I know Chewbacca is still there.

484
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:44,280
Scott: Right.

485
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:44,945
Scott: And R2D2 is still there.

486
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:45,631
Scott: I was real worried.

487
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:48,399
Scott: R2D2 is sleeping the whole time.

488
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:49,579
Scott: But he's still all right.

489
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,080
Rym: I both expected and assumed that Chewie was going to go kamikaze after Han bit it.

490
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,892
Rym: And I was real happy that he was like, nope, I'm just going to.

491
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,640
Rym: I'm going to get my revenge later.

492
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:01,280
Scott: So we only got four bad asses left.

493
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:01,582
Scott: Right.

494
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:04,980
Scott: By my account, you got Leia, R2, Poe and Rey.

495
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:06,639
Rym: Rey is going to be a bad ass.

496
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,645
Scott: Yeah, but she doesn't.

497
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:09,360
Scott: I mean, she has bad ass skills.

498
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,049
Scott: The only scene that had the weight you're talking about is when she picked up the lightsaber and had a vision.

499
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,500
Scott: Yeah, that's the only one.

500
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,041
Scott: Yes.

501
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:24,540
Rym: And it's you sort of implied that her reaction was partly because of, you know, she sensed the thing that Obi-Wan sensed.

502
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,160
Scott: Well, you heard the voice of Obi-Wan and Yoda while she was having that vision.

503
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:28,741
Scott: Right.

504
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:39,739
Rym: But maybe you can point out that in the old world, only Ben noticed that she like the old only had weight because Ben noticed it and it had weight because Leia watched it.

505
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:46,240
Rym: But here, no one knew it happened except her because she's the successor to the Jedi.

506
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:53,299
Rym: She's the only one who knew that the weight of that event didn't actually come crashing down on screen for anyone.

507
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:00,577
Rym: So it makes sense, even though stylistically you miss that, like, base drop of the moment, it hit a different way.

508
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:09,170
Rym: Yeah, I think where I want to go with the rest of this, I mean, could use a little more space combat, right?

509
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:15,710
Rym: Yeah, but the space combat was real satisfying because it looked good as opposed to an episode one where it looked like shit.

510
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:16,652
Rym: Yeah, that's true.

511
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:19,163
Rym: Like, is it the space fights in the like?

512
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:19,805
Scott: I like to me.

513
00:28:19,846 --> 00:28:25,150
Scott: he was escaping the, you know, the Star Destroyer, the TIE fighter was stuck on the thing.

514
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:37,970
Rym: Yeah, I like how we got a lot more sort of like technical stuff, like because they had, you know, modern technology to do the effects, you got a lot more like real zoomed in technical stuff going on on those ships and the fights.

515
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,850
Rym: Porkins made his cinematic cameo, which I was very pleased with.

516
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,832
Scott: You got Captain Phasma, who is basically Boba Fett 2.0.

517
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:46,710
Scott: Yeah, you know, don't appear a lot.

518
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,709
Scott: Don't say a lot.

519
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,030
Rym: But pointedly, pointedly not dead.

520
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,390
Rym: Obviously not dead because, yeah, throw her in the trash compactor.

521
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,190
Rym: That was funny, but that means off screen death.

522
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,070
Rym: Boba Fett didn't die off screen until you see him dead.

523
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:00,738
Rym: He's not dead.

524
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,549
Scott: He fell in the Sarla.

525
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,550
Rym: Yeah, Phasma is coming back and it's going to be great.

526
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:07,170
Scott: Yeah, obviously, but that's the Boba Fett character.

527
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,050
Scott: But Boba Fett wasn't in episode four.

528
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,570
Scott: So that's part of your twenty five percent.

529
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,909
Scott: Not the same as episode four.

530
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,549
Rym: Was there a Boba Fett in?

531
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:14,756
Rym: No, I guess there was no.

532
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:16,250
Scott: Boba Fett appeared for the first time.

533
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,310
Rym: And I said, oh, Boba Fett, as in the faceless background character that everyone gets obsessed with.

534
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:21,833
Scott: Greedo.

535
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:23,750
Scott: Yeah, not Boba Fett.

536
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,554
Rym: I was very happy that J.J.

537
00:29:25,654 --> 00:29:31,510
Rym: Abrams let that scene happen where Han Solo fucking murders those people.

538
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:36,150
Rym: I feel like that was just a middle finger to George Lucas, like, no, he shot first.

539
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,769
Rym: He shoots first every time.

540
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,406
Rym: That's all he does is shoot first.

541
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:46,289
Rym: You know, where the two factions are both like, hey, you owe us money, and then he murders them all the end.

542
00:29:46,591 --> 00:29:48,050
Scott: Oh, with the monsters come out and shit?

543
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,311
Rym: Yeah.

544
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:54,670
Scott: Yeah, that was sort of like, I don't know, it's it felt like a formulaic modern movie kind of scene there.

545
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,928
Scott: I didn't really care too much.

546
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,990
Rym: I mean, similar stuff went down to a lesser scale when he was in the cantina dealing with all the people he owes money to.

547
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:02,966
Rym: And they turn that into a villain here.

548
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,450
Rym: They kind of just killed all those people off because then they killed Bonoff.

549
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,107
Rym: So it didn't matter.

550
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,298
Rym: It's just I feel.

551
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:11,870
Rym: I wonder if I wonder if Star Wars.

552
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,028
Scott: Yeah, it's watchable.

553
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:18,770
Scott: It's enjoyable, but it's not like I'm going to watch it ten thousand times the rest of my life, like real Star Wars.

554
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:20,790
Rym: I will watch it several more times.

555
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:28,510
Scott: I mean, I could watch it another time to see things I didn't see the first time, but I don't see myself like if it's on, I will watch it.

556
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,150
Scott: I will intentionally turn it on on purpose, no matter how old I am, a thousand times.

557
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:47,910
Rym: I think that, but I haven't it hasn't been tested yet because the original trilogy was tested by the fact that I was a kid who'd be sitting at home like fucking around on my computer and I turn on the TV and be flipping through cables and I come into like the middle of episode five and I'd always stop.

558
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:48,330
Scott: Yep.

559
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:56,728
Rym: So the test will be if we're hanging out and someone puts on Star Wars, the new one, and everyone just sits there and watches it, not saying a word.

560
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:59,075
Rym: or if someone says, let's do something else.

561
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:02,530
Scott: I'll say let's do something else pretty quickly.

562
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,351
Rym: I don't know.

563
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:12,690
Rym: But I guess what's important is that the the new movie gave me faith that the rest of the trilogy is probably going to be as good, if not better than it.

564
00:31:13,053 --> 00:31:14,029
Scott: Yeah, it'll be serviceable.

565
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:14,431
Scott: Right.

566
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:18,590
Scott: I mean, I say that I expect episode eight to be a remake of episode five.

567
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,176
Rym: I don't know.

568
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,088
Rym: I wonder if.

569
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:20,571
Scott: Right.

570
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:33,410
Scott: I mean, the only difference is that they've already taken the beginning of episode five and put it episode eight and put it into episode seven because the beginning of Empire Strikes Back, right after the battle on Hoth, Luke goes to Dagobah.

571
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,910
Scott: Well, she already just went to Dagobah or the equivalent thereof to see Luke, who is now Yoda.

572
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:43,690
Rym: So Scott pointed out something, you know, would be the best possible way for episode eight to open a battle in the snow.

573
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,950
Rym: Luke pulls his cloak back to talk or whatever.

574
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,809
Scott: It's all a robot man.

575
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,789
Rym: No, he's the one who has C3PO's arm.

576
00:31:51,294 --> 00:31:52,024
Scott: Why would he have C3PO's arm?

577
00:31:52,471 --> 00:31:53,429
Rym: C3PO's arm is missing.

578
00:31:54,631 --> 00:31:57,090
Scott: Yeah, it's true, but Luke already has a robot hand.

579
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,331
Scott: Yeah.

580
00:31:57,371 --> 00:32:04,350
Rym: What if you replace it with C3PO's and that just happens because what I was getting at is I doubt that the and this might sound dumb.

581
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,153
Rym: The main reason I have faith that J.J.

582
00:32:07,253 --> 00:32:24,650
Rym: Abrams and the people making new Star Wars at least understand what Luke is fucked up in the, you know, the second trilogy and what made the first trilogy great is C3PO's red arm because it's so it's so C3PO comes out and he obviously has this really like weird.

583
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:40,870
Scott: They intentionally throughout this movie left a lot of things open as to what happened between Return of the Jedi and this movie so that they can fill them in with their sea of content that they are going to produce, especially since they threw all the cannon away.

584
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,528
Scott: They can do whatever the fuck they want now.

585
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:49,390
Rym: As long as they do not fill those gaps in the next two movies, because that's what George Lucas would do.

586
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:57,610
Scott: Well, there's also side movies, right, like Rogue One and such that are being made that could fill in a lot of those things, which this is Mad Max.

587
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,737
Rym: Fury Road did the same thing.

588
00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:00,330
Rym: Fury Road is a masterpiece.

589
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:09,850
Rym: It was the best movie of 2015, but there is a video game that did and a comic that together give you a ton of really awesome back story.

590
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:14,530
Rym: But the fact that all that shit was not in the movie is one of the things that made the movie great.

591
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:19,690
Rym: Putting that crap in the movies would ruin them in this context.

592
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:26,170
Rym: So as long as they never explain why C3PO has a red arm, that means that they get it.

593
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:33,470
Rym: If at any point in episode eight you find out in the movie why C3PO has a red arm, I will not trust episode nine.

594
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,909
Scott: You're going to see I guarantee you're going to find out why.

595
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:39,990
Rym: I think you find out in a comic, or in a show, or in a tweet.

596
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,930
Scott: You're going to find out probably in a movie, because they're making a lot of movies.

597
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,579
Scott: And if you do find out in a book, comic, tweet,

598
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:47,181
Scott: etc.,

599
00:33:47,201 --> 00:33:49,530
Scott: I don't think it'll be a tweet, right?

600
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:55,144
Scott: It will also be shown in movie as well, right?

601
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:57,190
Scott: They double up on a lot of these things, right?

602
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:02,290
Scott: For example, there's that guy who gets killed by Calleren in the village early in the movie.

603
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:05,249
Scott: And it's like he's some important rebel guy, but you don't know who he is.

604
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,708
Scott: But if you read the book, they tell you his name, and they give you some small...

605
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:12,270
Rym: Ah, but that's a big part of Star Wars, because everyone knew what a TIE fighter was, right?

606
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:17,188
Rym: No one says the words "TIE fighter" until episode six, at any point.

607
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,969
Rym: And yet, everyone knew they were called TIE fighters.

608
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:21,887
Scott: Do you know why?

609
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:24,530
Rym: No, I don't know the specific reason why.

610
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,650
Scott: The first way... As far as I know, I could be wrong, some Star Wars nerds would smack me on this.

611
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:31,810
Rym: Second-hand knowledge, but I don't actually know.

612
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,929
Rym: And this is one topic where our listener will fucking jump on us if we're wrong about anything.

613
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,810
Scott: Sure, jump on me, because I could be wrong.

614
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:49,909
Scott: The first way that I am aware that a human being not involved in the production of Star Wars could know that a TIE fighter was called a TIE fighter was if they went to the store to buy a toy that was a TIE fighter.

615
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,949
Scott: And it says "TIE fighter" on the package.

616
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:53,789
Rym: That's how I know.

617
00:34:54,092 --> 00:35:03,066
Rym: I learned a lot about X-Wings and TIE fighters because of some promotional books that were made that were like, "Hey, here's the technical diagrams of

618
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:03,530
Rym: Y-Wings!".

619
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,029
Scott: Yes, there were lots of things like that.

620
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:10,650
Scott: But I think a lot of those things, like novels and such, came out after... I think the toy was the first thing that you could get.

621
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,348
Rym: But there is a history...

622
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,610
Scott: The same thing with names of a lot of characters, because they had toys.

623
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:18,345
Scott: Like, how did you know that that droid was our... Whatever, it's not R2-D2.

624
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,810
Scott: How do you know what kind of droid that is?

625
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,970
Scott: Because they sold a toy, and on the package, it said the name of the droid.

626
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:28,190
Rym: That's why every kid knew what an R... Like, they knew about R2 and R5 and all the different droids and all that nonsense.

627
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,970
Scott: The toy packages, as far as I know, were the first place any of that was printed.

628
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:41,970
Rym: Thus, there is a strong tradition in Star Wars, it is very true to the original trilogy, to have a bunch of that stuff explained in side media, but not in the movies.

629
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:45,810
Scott: Well, they threw all their side media in the garbage so they can redo all of it.

630
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:46,308
Rym: Exactly.

631
00:35:47,171 --> 00:35:50,190
Rym: And true to that form, I'm going to ignore most of that side media.

632
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:50,797
Scott: That's right.

633
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:51,770
Scott: You don't need to know.

634
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:54,608
Rym: Because the parts that matter, like names of things...

635
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,610
Scott: Well, this also means that the good side media was thrown in the garbage also, like TIE fighter.

636
00:35:59,390 --> 00:35:59,480
Rym: Yeah.

637
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,390
Scott: And Admiral Thrawn, who, if they had used him, could have saved this movie.

638
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,069
Rym: So, Scott, there's two competing movies...

639
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:06,344
Scott: I don't know how to use the word

640
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:06,770
Scott: "saved."

641
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,586
Scott: I want to say "made a thousand times

642
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:08,889
Scott: better.".

643
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:11,288
Rym: I mean, Star Wars is not... So, Star Wars...

644
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,670
Scott: It wasn't so bad that it needed saving.

645
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:26,570
Rym: This movie saved the Star Wars franchise because the bad taste... The bad taste in my mouth from the episodes one, two, and three was so bad that until I saw this movie, cautious optimism was as high as my height meter could go.

646
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,428
Rym: Like, I could not go in with anything other than "please, please don't be

647
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:31,710
Rym: bad.".

648
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:33,786
Scott: Yeah, mine was pretty much "please don't suck, don't

649
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:34,008
Scott: suck.".

650
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:34,339
Rym: Yeah.

651
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:40,830
Rym: And it is possible... The argument seems to be about 50/50 on the internet of people who are arguing about this.

652
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,850
Rym: between either episode eight is going to be a mirror of episode five...

653
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:46,570
Scott: Yeah, probably.

654
00:36:47,252 --> 00:37:04,350
Rym: Or episode four and episode seven were mirrors just to reboot the franchise safely and to give that due homage and to set up the same beginning story, but the next one is free now because it succeeded to go batshit.

655
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,689
Rym: It could be Admiral Thrawn nonsense for all we know.

656
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,283
Scott: Hope so.

657
00:37:08,214 --> 00:37:11,770
Rym: Yeah, I hope... You know, Admiral Thrawn... A lot of you kids care about Boba Fett.

658
00:37:12,392 --> 00:37:17,710
Scott: We had the, you know, the generic general guy who you said is secretly the Wizard of Oz, right?

659
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,670
Scott: But imagine if he was Thrawn instead.

660
00:37:20,214 --> 00:37:21,088
Scott: You could have just done that.

661
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:26,370
Scott: Just make him blue and make him smarter, more dangerous, more scary, right?

662
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,155
Scott: That's the thing.

663
00:37:27,235 --> 00:37:28,890
Scott: is it wasn't scary, right?

664
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,649
Rym: That guy was scarier than Kylo Ren.

665
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:41,210
Scott: Of course, but old Star Wars, all of them, even when there's Ewoks, had scary shit and there was no scary shit in episode seven or one, two, and three.

666
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:43,621
Scott: That's really the key ingredient.

667
00:37:43,902 --> 00:37:49,590
Scott: that the original trilogy was missing and this movie is still missing is scary shit, right?

668
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,710
Scott: The Empire is scary and badass.

669
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:56,950
Scott: Everything is black and evil and clean and a machine of death.

670
00:37:57,631 --> 00:38:01,350
Scott: And here, even though they have a weapon more powerful than the Death Star, it ain't scary.

671
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,022
Scott: It's like you blow up the Senate like, "Eh,

672
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:03,386
Scott: whatever.".

673
00:38:03,911 --> 00:38:05,450
Scott: Was that Senate on Coruscant, by the way?

674
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,230
Scott: Did they just blow up Coruscant and not even give a fuck?

675
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,010
Scott: Or is that Senate meeting somewhere else that wasn't Coruscant?

676
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,028
Rym: That, I don't know.

677
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:12,510
Rym: All we know is that now who's in charge?

678
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:16,010
Rym: I guess Leia is now in charge of everything because everyone else is dead.

679
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,488
Scott: I'm just saying, you know, the Empire is in charge, right?

680
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:27,668
Rym: I'm actually real happy that Carrie Fisher is going to be in the rest of these movies, even though we lost Han because a lot of people have been talking about her autobiography, which I think I'm going to read now.

681
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:29,730
Rym: She is a stone cold killer.

682
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,487
Scott: You didn't know that?

683
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,067
Scott: No, but to the extent- I mean, you've seen the Blues Brothers, right?

684
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:41,410
Rym: The extent to which she is a badass was elucidated for me in a few choice anecdotes about her not taking shit from George Lucas.

685
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:52,810
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I didn't read her biography or anything or autobiography or whatever, but, you know, she was on Broadway at one point and when that book came out, I remember reading, you know, meta about it on the internet.

686
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:59,850
Scott: So I pretty much know all the- I knew even way before all the bits that were to be known, including those Lucas type stories.

687
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:05,086
Scott: So it was just, you know, when she started going on the media circuit, I was like, "Whoa, look, she's doing

688
00:39:05,106 --> 00:39:05,328
Scott: stuff.".

689
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:17,928
Rym: But when I was a kid, like, you know, obsessed with Star Wars, like you were, and when I got TIE Fighter, you know, I got that game, and I played it, and that voice comes in, "Signal Vice Admiral Thrawn to launch his TIE Squadrons

690
00:39:17,968 --> 00:39:18,410
Rym: immediately.".

691
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:18,970
Rym: That's right.

692
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,368
Rym: Cuts to the blue guy, and I was like, "Who is

693
00:39:21,408 --> 00:39:21,610
Rym: that?".

694
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:26,823
Scott: And then I went on the- Yeah, there was nobody in Star Wars Episode 7 where I said, "Who's that there, the most

695
00:39:26,884 --> 00:39:27,289
Scott: amazing?".

696
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:37,070
Rym: And then I went on the, you know, the proto-internet of the time, and I looked up "Thrawn" and I found out who that was, and I was obsessed with that motherfucker.

697
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:37,498
Scott: Why not?

698
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,890
Scott: I even read his books, and they weren't the greatest.

699
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:47,610
Scott: They're supposed to be the best Star Wars novels, and I've said this maybe before, but if those are the best Star Wars novels, I'm not reading any others.

700
00:39:48,872 --> 00:39:51,770
Scott: But that doesn't make the character any less the best.

701
00:39:51,850 --> 00:40:02,706
Rym: Imagine if the end of Episode 8 is, you know, the first order or whatever sucks, and they're kind of failing, and Thrawn shows up with that fleet that was sent to the outer Rym, and he's like, "What's going on

702
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:03,109
Rym: here?".

703
00:40:03,532 --> 00:40:06,989
Scott: Oh my God, that would be- What have you been doing?

704
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,648
Scott: He just kills Carol Loren, the end.

705
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:11,926
Scott: He's like, "Now you have to deal with the square

706
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:12,469
Scott: boss.".

707
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,105
Scott: And I was like, "Thank God,

708
00:40:14,226 --> 00:40:14,509
Scott: yes.".

709
00:40:14,794 --> 00:40:15,750
Rym: I did like the moment.

710
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:19,450
Scott: And then they win, and they don't just- I hope they don't just win in Episode 8.

711
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,569
Scott: I hope the bad guys win Episode 9, too.

712
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:23,770
Scott: Kill all, yeah, just boom.

713
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,330
Rym: It becomes, yeah, so Scott, you wanna go crazy?

714
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:30,010
Rym: Yeah, Grand Admiral Thrawn and Leia get married, and then they rule the galaxy forever.

715
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,589
Scott: They don't need to get married, just kill everybody, and then Emperor wins, the end.

716
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:35,888
Scott: Thrawn is Emperor, the end.

717
00:40:37,514 --> 00:40:39,109
Scott: We need to wait for another rebellion to come along.

718
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:40,989
Scott: That's a shame.

719
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,910
Rym: I kind of want Poe and Finn to get together.

720
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,189
Rym: So does the whole internet.

721
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,950
Rym: Yeah, no, half the internet wants Finn and Rey to get together, which I don't see.

722
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,409
Scott: Which half of the internet is that?

723
00:40:52,036 --> 00:40:52,628
Rym: It's out there.

724
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:53,410
Scott: Okay.

725
00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:57,730
Rym: But someone made a good gif where they pointed out- They weren't trading jackets.

726
00:40:58,171 --> 00:41:05,302
Rym: Yeah, so when Poe sees him in the jacket, watch closely, right before he says it looks good on you, he bites his lip like,

727
00:41:05,323 --> 00:41:05,444
Rym: "Mmm.".

728
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:06,969
Rym: He's checking it out.

729
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:07,447
Rym: That's right.

730
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:12,690
Rym: Either that was ad-libbed, Han Solo, Harrison Ford style, or that's canon.

731
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:13,785
Scott: It's canon.

732
00:41:14,992 --> 00:41:16,390
Rym: This isn't- The plasma canon.

733
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,950
Scott: This isn't some shipping action, right?

734
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,650
Scott: This is real ship, like an X-wing.

735
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,327
Scott: It's a real ship.

736
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,049
Scott: It goes to other galaxies.

737
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,167
Rym: There was a moment, actually, so I was obsessed with the Tydarian shuttle, because that was another one of those things.

738
00:41:28,187 --> 00:41:28,330
Rym: you see.

739
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:28,817
Scott: I love me.

740
00:41:28,857 --> 00:41:29,570
Scott: a Tydarian shuttle.

741
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:33,906
Rym: What's going on with that thing, because Luke has the toy, and then you see it, and you're like, "Oh, man, what's that

742
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:34,128
Rym: thing?".

743
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:40,550
Rym: The transport that came down the few times they used one that had the two wings, that's the new Tydarian shuttle.

744
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,150
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't need the top wing.

745
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:42,828
Scott: It's going in space.

746
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,308
Rym: So I feel like the- I'm going to watch the movie again the next time I watch it.

747
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:56,930
Rym: I want to actually pay attention to notes to really make sure I see every one of the- Not the plot point homage to episode four, but the cinematic homage.

748
00:41:57,514 --> 00:42:05,070
Rym: There are a lot of scenes that are obviously just saying, like when Rey is climbing around inside, Ben climbing around inside.

749
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,608
Rym: There's all those little scenes.

750
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,670
Rym: I want to make sure I didn't miss any, because some of them were real subtle.

751
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,190
Rym: Some were not subtle.

752
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,029
Scott: I spotted so many.

753
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:16,388
Scott: I feel like if I missed any, I wouldn't be able to know if I missed them, or if I was just seeing them again.

754
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,970
Rym: Yeah, there's a few.

755
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:21,250
Rym: I, you know, at some point- And not remembering that I remembered them from the last time.

756
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:26,150
Rym: Cracked, or someone like that, you know, is going to put up a YouTube video of like, here's the 800 specific references.

757
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,590
Rym: We did the research for you.

758
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,309
Rym: Just watch this video.

759
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,170
Scott: Yeah, here we put side by side.

760
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:37,590
Scott: Here's Obi-Wan crawling on the side of the Death Star, and here's Rey crawling in the inside of the thing, and there's the exact same camera angle, and, you know.

761
00:42:41,113 --> 00:42:42,909
Scott: Turning off the thing, you know.

762
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,410
Scott: Turning it back on with some Stormtroopers walkman.

763
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:46,480
Scott: Right?

764
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:52,470
Scott: Even the room with the trash compactor had like the same layout of like controls as the one in the Death Star, right?

765
00:42:55,752 --> 00:42:59,450
Rym: So, overall, I mean, I don't know what we can- I mean, we're assuming you saw the movie.

766
00:43:00,031 --> 00:43:01,088
Rym: You have your opinion on it.

767
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,469
Rym: Listen, it's not- Your opinion's not going to change because of us.

768
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,650
Scott: It's not the best movie ever, but it ain't bad.

769
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:07,649
Scott: Why, if you're a nerd, why aren't you watching this?

770
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:16,550
Rym: The thing is, coming out of the movie, like, halfway through the movie, like, you know when you start a movie, like, once you get like fully immersed in it, you kind of like completely zone out the theater?

771
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:22,789
Rym: I had that Star Wars feel that I have not had in a long time, and that counts for a lot.

772
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:36,609
Scott: I didn't have much of a Star Wars feel, but if it wasn't Star Wars, if this is just like some other generic sci-fi that, you know, is the same plot just without, you know, you change all the X-wings into some other ship you made up, et cetera, et cetera, right?

773
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:40,349
Scott: I don't think anyone would give any shits.

774
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:46,830
Rym: Thing is, I think half the audience for this movie never really saw or paid attention to other Star Wars movies.

775
00:43:47,551 --> 00:43:49,490
Rym: A lot of people, this is their first Star Wars.

776
00:43:49,692 --> 00:43:55,730
Scott: Right, but if this was like, you know, Gennaro Space Adventure that's not licensed in any way as a new property.

777
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,870
Rym: I'd probably be into it, because I'm fucking into Gennaro Space Adventure.

778
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:05,950
Rym: I mean Guardians of the Galaxy was great, and that could have been a Star Wars movie, but for like four scenes.

779
00:44:07,772 --> 00:44:11,610
Rym: Yeah, I'm into Star Wars, I'm into space biz.

780
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,668
Rym: Now, what's interesting to me is, talk about J.J.

781
00:44:14,749 --> 00:44:18,030
Rym: Abrams, because the Star Trek reboots, in my opinion, are garbage.

782
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:21,030
Scott: Well, I mean, I can think all Star Trek is garbage.

783
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:31,490
Rym: No, I like old Star Trek, but every one of these Star Trek reboots, they're not really even touching on the speculative fiction aspect, and they're just space nonsense and character drop.

784
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,510
Scott: But I mean, that's what Star Trek is.

785
00:44:34,693 --> 00:44:36,810
Rym: Now, what Star Trek have you seen?

786
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,350
Scott: Quite a bit, more than I wish I had seen.

787
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,000
Scott: Have you seen any D-Space 9 or TNG?

788
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,929
Scott: Yeah, I've seen many episodes of both of those.

789
00:44:46,211 --> 00:44:48,989
Rym: Any character other than Picard from either of them?

790
00:44:50,331 --> 00:44:58,369
Scott: Okay, so in the next generation, you've got Data the android guy, you've got the beard guy, you've got Wil Wheaton.

791
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,481
Rym: Alright, we're already falling off to beard.

792
00:45:00,521 --> 00:45:01,710
Rym: guy and name of the actor.

793
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:02,745
Scott: Reading rainbow guy.

794
00:45:05,232 --> 00:45:09,349
Scott: And in D-Space 9, you've got short guy with big ears who serves at the bar.

795
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,730
Scott: Oh, isn't there like this guy with lumpy forehead in both of them?

796
00:45:16,876 --> 00:45:17,810
Rym: Yes, a Klingon.

797
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:19,469
Rym: There are Klingons.

798
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:20,197
Scott: See?

799
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:20,669
Scott: I know stuff.

800
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:21,690
Rym: Alright, alright.

801
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:30,072
Rym: But I guess the new Star Trek movies are not very true to much of the legacy of Star Trek, and J.J.

802
00:45:30,112 --> 00:45:35,928
Rym: Abrams is sort of using it for this like character-driven drama action movies, and the trailers are very action-y.

803
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,078
Rym: Star Wars, at least, J.J.

804
00:45:39,178 --> 00:45:45,068
Rym: Abrams is all about worshipping the source material, and at least understands- Yeah, by redoing it.

805
00:45:45,555 --> 00:45:46,629
Scott: It couldn't really work.

806
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:58,650
Rym: He understands what people liked in Star Wars and is doing proper homage to it, and in Star Trek, it's just- Well, he doesn't understand that I liked evil, badass Empire guys, and he's giving me lame pansy ones.

807
00:45:58,711 --> 00:45:59,330
Rym: I think he did.

808
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:15,441
Rym: I think like, so I've read, there was a, I don't know how true this is, but I read an article pointing out that apparently the toy marketing people assumed that Kylo Ren was going to be the biggest selling toy because Darth Vader was, and they didn't realize that Kylo Ren is

809
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:16,124
Scott: literally

810
00:46:16,184 --> 00:46:17,730
Rym: the opposite of Darth Vader.

811
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,810
Rym: You're supposed to hate him because he sucks.

812
00:46:21,332 --> 00:46:32,186
Rym: I did love the scene where it's the Darth Vader whatever, and then she's like, blah, blah, blah, wearing a mask, and he's like, and he takes his mask off, and you expect it to be some, and it's just- A lame-o?

813
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:35,670
Rym: It's just lame-o emo guy who you expect his face to be covered in pimples.

814
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,729
Scott: See, you know what could have saved it there also?

815
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:37,975
Scott: Yeah?

816
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:43,970
Scott: Is if they could have, instead of making it, you don't have to make it evil like Darth Vader, right?

817
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,950
Scott: And you don't have to make him a pansy, right?

818
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:52,250
Scott: You have to do something that I don't think Americans would understand and make him sexy, right?

819
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:57,010
Rym: If he had a char asnival face- Scott, I got some real bad news for you.

820
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,590
Scott: If that was a char asnival face under there, it would have been like, oh my God.

821
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,130
Rym: That, so I got some real bad news.

822
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:05,050
Rym: I agree with you, but I got some real bad news for you.

823
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,689
Rym: Half the internet thinks he is super hot.

824
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:07,669
Scott: What the fuck?

825
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,130
Rym: Partly because he's also evil and brooding.

826
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:15,430
Rym: I think there's a part of the internet, a big part that likes brooding more than any other character trait.

827
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,450
Scott: I mean, is this just like goth kids or what?

828
00:47:17,853 --> 00:47:18,508
Rym: I don't even know.

829
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:19,928
Scott: I mean, who thinks that that's hot?

830
00:47:22,935 --> 00:47:24,790
Rym: I don't want to go into that community too much to find out.

831
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:27,529
Scott: I mean, Darth Vader's mangled face is hotter than that.

832
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:28,403
Rym: Okay.

833
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,209
Rym: Well, he's got harmonica skills, so.

834
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:30,640
Scott: Sure.

835
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:35,750
Scott: Uh, if that's hot, man, I don't want to know what else you're going to do.

836
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,304
Rym: Yeah, if he had been like char hot.

837
00:47:38,274 --> 00:47:38,789
Scott: Oh my God.

838
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:39,449
Scott: Yeah.

839
00:47:40,552 --> 00:47:42,549
Scott: I basically assume that phasma is char hot.

840
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,349
Rym: Uh, phasma is going to be the boat.

841
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:46,502
Rym: Like phasma is Boba Fett 1.5 times over a thing.

842
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:50,950
Scott: I mean, uh, you know, prequel trilogy Boba Fett was kind of hot.

843
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:57,450
Rym: The only question is there's three ways for phasma to go eventually fight for the good guys, but for the wrong reasons, not for the right reasons.

844
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,670
Rym: She's not going to be a good guy.

845
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,085
Scott: Boba Fett.

846
00:47:59,250 --> 00:47:59,669
Scott: I'm telling you.

847
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:05,270
Rym: Yeah, but is it Boba Fett that helps Finn or power someone for bad reasons?

848
00:48:05,774 --> 00:48:06,929
Rym: Is it just bad guy?

849
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:09,169
Scott: Who does things for her own reasons?

850
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:10,890
Rym: Which might be great.

851
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,210
Rym: I don't think Kylo Ren is going to be redeemed though.

852
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:20,690
Rym: I think that just, I think that's going to be a, uh, Saruman falling off of his tower to the death in episode nine or maybe episode eight.

853
00:48:21,653 --> 00:48:23,909
Scott: Yeah, he's definitely a little Saruman going on there.

854
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:24,182
Scott: Yeah.

855
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:25,110
Rym: You know what?

856
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,269
Scott: Saruman that was way cooler than Kylo.

857
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:27,930
Rym: Yeah.

858
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:35,076
Rym: Except watch, you know, watch those movies again and watch the actor for Saruman is like 10,000 times better.

859
00:48:42,242 --> 00:48:44,400
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

860
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,460
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and brand.

861
00:48:48,602 --> 00:48:48,760
Rym: Okay.

862
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,576
Rym: For the logos.

00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,859

865
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,599

871
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,639
Rym: You expected the next name to be yours, but it was me.

872
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,140
Rym: Dio Clinton Walton.

873
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,419

Rym: Finn Eric Silveraude.

882
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,560
Rym: And then he placed a single finger upon his mustache.

883
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:05,939
Rym: Kinetic Man.

884
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:06,880

Rym: Chris Reimer.

892
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,278
Rym: And Thomas Hahn.

893
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:23,057
Rym: You may have noticed a slowdown of episodes and a trickle of Rims Ranch recently, and we're also a little behind on doing the December Q&A.

894
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:33,800
Rym: That's partly because a lot of travel and just after the holidays, and we actually still have a lot of work to do for PAX South where we're doing three panels.

895
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:43,559
Rym: So there's going to be a whole bunch of videos and stuff in a hurry, basically about three weeks after PAX, and GeekNights will also resume in full force around that time.

896
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:49,359
Rym: But we're going to do the Q&A a little bit different because I kind of got late to start on actually putting up the forum.

897
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:54,357
Rym: So this is going to be a Q&A, but the direction I have for you is ask us for advice.

898
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,358
Rym: The question should all be you asking for our direct advice on something, whatever it might be.

899
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,999
Rym: I'm sure you'll get wonderful answers from Scott on this.

900
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:15,678
Rym: And now I leave you with something pretty weird, but it's actually by the same guy who made something else pretty weird that I used another time.

901
00:51:17,715 --> 00:51:23,339
Media: [Singing] The snow glows white on the mountain tonight, not a footprint to be seen.

902
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:30,259
Media: A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the queen.

903
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,280
Media: The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.

904
00:51:39,401 --> 00:51:43,180
Media: Couldn't keep it in, even knows I've tried.

905
00:51:46,423 --> 00:51:49,419
Media: Don't let them in, don't let them see.

906
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,819
Media: Be the good goof you always have to be.

907
00:51:53,281 --> 00:51:56,198
Media: Conceal, don't feel, don't let them go.

908
00:51:59,503 --> 00:52:00,798
Media: Well now they know.

909
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,339
Media: Let it go, let it go.

910
00:52:06,621 --> 00:52:08,900
Media: Can't hold it back anymore.

911
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,271
Media: Let it go, let it go.

912
00:52:13,382 --> 00:52:16,220
Media: Turn away and slam the door.

913
00:52:18,062 --> 00:52:22,839
Rym: I don't care what they're going to say.

914
00:52:24,101 --> 00:52:26,460
Media: Let the storm rage on.

915
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,100
Media: The cold never bothered me anyway.
