1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,989
Scott: It's Tuesday January 23rd.

2
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:15,160
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:18,819
Scott: Tonight we discussed the new game battle lore.

4
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,367
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:25,626
Rym: Well, I certainly came home to a pleasant surprise today.

6
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:31,624
Scott: Yeah Well, I said last week that I would try something new and I bought video games on Amazon.

7
00:00:31,684 --> 00:00:39,357
Scott: I ordered both Wario where we and Phoenix Wright Injustice for all the new Phoenix Wright game.

8
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:39,758
Rym: Yep.

9
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:49,650
Scott: Now I had previously done this with Castlevania portrait of ruin And well the game showed up today Monday, which is about a week after they came out.

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,527
Scott: So if you're thinking about pre-ordering games on Amazon, I can tell you a few things.

11
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:56,816
Scott: number one The price is right.

12
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:00,310
Scott: You'll pay the same price or less than you'll pay at EB or GameStop.

13
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:02,620
Scott: You know, maybe Best Buy will get you a lower price.

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,228
Scott: Sometimes maybe they like to have sales there But you know, probably not.

15
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,443
Scott: Also, you'll get the games about a week after they come out.

16
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:15,819
Scott: if you're pre-order and choose the free United States Postal Service shipping.

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,970
Rym: I mean you could pick overnight shipping if you're a nut.

18
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:31,250
Scott: Yeah, so if you really kind of need games the day they come out and for some games you do need that You know Especially online type games Like if I was a World of Warcraft player and I didn't think it was a complete waste of time the stupidest thing ever.

19
00:01:31,773 --> 00:01:34,389
Scott: Then yes, you would need the Burning Crusade the day it came out.

20
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:39,542
Scott: but WarioWare, you know, it's not like I was having a party this week.

21
00:01:39,763 --> 00:01:41,510
Scott: So I don't really need it any sooner.

22
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:42,253
Rym: Yeah, though.

23
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:44,704
Rym: We may possibly have a party next weekend.

24
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:45,969
Scott: No, I can't.

25
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,088
Rym: We have to know.

26
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:52,923
Scott: Anyway, we might not even have the Wario unlocked by then we better.

27
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:56,295
Scott: all I can say is that Wario and Phoenix right?

28
00:01:56,355 --> 00:02:04,850
Rym: Whoo WarioWare smooth moves is exactly what I could hope it would be and All I have to say is that monkey ball can die in a fire.

29
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,890
Rym: Monkey ball for the Wii is perhaps the worst launch title.

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:16,118
Scott: Yeah It's dumb I know because there are those other launch tiles the kinds you don't even mention like what the kinds based on crap Tea kids cartoons.

31
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:17,264
Rym: those might be better.

32
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:20,898
Rym: No Monkey ball is pretty bad.

33
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:24,034
Scott: monkey ball is bad, but it's not that bad I think it is.

34
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:33,009
Scott: I mean no because there are games out there like yours The Barney game for the Sega Genesis, you know what I'll bet that those games for the Wii work.

35
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:37,123
Rym: Monkey ball doesn't even work if those minigames are non-functional.

36
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:37,906
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

37
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:38,327
Scott: It's bad.

38
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,920
Scott: Maybe we'll do a show on how bad the monkey ball is.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,730
Scott: You might have to eventually but that's not for today.

40
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:45,470
Rym: Yeah.

41
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:57,329
Rym: So anyway in the news it appears that some people over at the score hero forums have figured out how to put your own songs into guitar heroes - oh Well, that's something that's very necessary.

42
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:04,630
Rym: The bad news is it takes eight separate programs 12 complicated steps a modded ps2.

43
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:07,618
Scott: How what the hell are they doing?

44
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:10,510
Scott: It's like wow, how could it take eight separate?

45
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,533
Rym: I didn't read it.

46
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:23,090
Rym: But from what I gather what you essentially do is rip the game Futs with it burn it to a new disc with your modified version and then play it like a mod game in your modded ps2.

47
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,205
Scott: Yeah, they should have really just combined all those things into.

48
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:30,177
Scott: you know, you don't go out and say no I think here's a way to hack guitar here.

49
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:33,150
Scott: You say here we wrote a program that does it in one step.

50
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:36,040
Rym: I can guarantee that within a few months.

51
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,224
Rym: Someone's going to do just that.

52
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:38,890
Scott: Yeah, that's sort of a necessity.

53
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,060
Rym: This was definitely not the hey, this is now common.

54
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,648
Rym: This was the hey, there's a way to do it.

55
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:45,150
Rym: post.

56
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,715
Rym: This is the very beginning.

57
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:51,430
Scott: plus this thing kind of wouldn't really be necessary if there was a step mania equivalent for guitar hero.

58
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:52,153
Rym: But there is.

59
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:53,337
Scott: oh there is really.

60
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:55,646
Rym: it's called frets on fire and we talked about it.

61
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:56,790
Scott: It's kind of a lame name.

62
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:04,781
Scott: They should have called it just guitar mania or something to get a step mania or like Oh String mania or even fret mania.

63
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:09,966
Scott: if you want to keep the fret fret mania school They might have been worried about being sued or something like that.

64
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:10,749
Rym: Yeah, you never know.

65
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:24,068
Rym: Anyway, but the issue here is that from the screenshots I've seen and from what I've looked at Compared to guitar heroes 2 frets on fire looks pretty goddamn lame.

66
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:30,010
Rym: Yeah I mean at least step mania does everything possible to perfectly emulate a DDR machines.

67
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,961
Scott: That mania is in many ways better than a DDR machine.

68
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:37,454
Scott: I mean other than a supernova machine step mania.

69
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:47,470
Scott: the current version and that's I'm not even counting the beta version just the current stable version is About as good as a DDR 8th mix or a in the groove 2 machine.

70
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:55,825
Scott: I mean as long as you have a powerful enough computer and your song files aren't screwed up and your music is in sync And you have a pad that's good and you have a good dance pad.

71
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:58,680
Rym: Yes, but yeah I mean it emulates right down to.

72
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:00,610
Rym: you could set it up like an arcade machine.

73
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,442
Rym: You could hook up a coin slot and it would deal with it.

74
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:05,430
Rym: It has an interface ready for a coin slot.

75
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:07,196
Rym: Yep, it's just straight up.

76
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:08,620
Rym: frets on fire.

77
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,610
Rym: Just kind of looks like lame 3d cubes coming down strings.

78
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:18,480
Scott: yeah, I have a feeling the people who made frets on fire are not the Not of these step mania developer caliber.

79
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,030
Rym: Well, their website is slow and at a weird domain.

80
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,122
Scott: That's always a tip-off that someone is not too bright.

81
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:32,549
Rym: Well, I have a feeling that the people I mean I might be totally wrong and if you if I'm wrong about this people who make frets on fire feel free to correct me.

82
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,990
Rym: But I get the impression that frets on fire was made and rushed out the door.

83
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:42,830
Rym: So they could be the first ones to make that hoping that the community would grow around them like it did in step mania.

84
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:50,190
Scott: Hmm and I'm realizing that the community grows around quality not the first to the gate as evidenced by the we.

85
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,709
Rym: Fret sound fire does have one new cool feature.

86
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:04,862
Rym: Apparently you can take a guitar heroes or guitar heroes to put it in your computer Rip it and then play all those songs straight up in frets on fire.

87
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:07,870
Scott: Oh now if only see that's not in step mania needs.

88
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,675
Scott: Yes, why doesn't step mania see?

89
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:10,798
Scott: yeah, yeah, they got what.

90
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:21,624
Scott: so basically step mania has everything that DDR needs except one feature frets on fire has Basically the barest bones of what guitar hero needs plus one feature.

91
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:22,627
Scott: the step mania doesn't have.

92
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:29,725
Rym: yeah because for step I mean we already actually have third mix fourth mix fifth mix Extra mix all those we have the discs.

93
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,072
Rym: Yeah Somewhere.

94
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:33,440
Scott: Yeah, if we didn't have we couldn't find about.

95
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,022
Scott: just buy them.

96
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:35,387
Rym: Yeah, they're not that hard to get.

97
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:43,929
Scott: the thing is It sucks because you know Those are all like ps1 games and the other DDRs of ps2 games and new DDRs or Xbox and ps3 games.

98
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,410
Scott: It's like without a ps3 and a 360 and a ps2 you can't play every DDR mix.

99
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,816
Scott: There is so step.

100
00:06:50,876 --> 00:07:02,781
Scott: if there was a way to load those things off the disc into step mania Then with one computer you could dance every DDR dance that ever dance though Honestly, I think the long-term answer is just to buy a DDR machine.

101
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:10,883
Scott: It is and put a step mania computer inside of it After ripping the songs off of the discs inside of it.

102
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:11,807
Rym: Yeah.

103
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:12,089
Rym: Yeah.

104
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:13,513
Rym: Anyway, though.

105
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:14,636
Rym: Here's the problem.

106
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:16,360
Scott: You can buy DDR machines on Amazon.

107
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,947
Scott: Also crisis machines and air hockey tables.

108
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:22,858
Scott: They're not that expensive Just as expensive as a car.

109
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,507
Scott: That's all you know are.

110
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:24,788
Scott: or DDR?

111
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,319
Rym: They're not as expensive as they used to be.

112
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,610
Scott: no they used to be more because you had to import them.

113
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:36,879
Rym: Yeah, but anyway that the problem with this feature is that apparently on a computer faster than any computer We own it takes more than eight hours.

114
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:37,442
Scott: No.

115
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:38,630
Scott: Well, that's bound to happen.

116
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:45,650
Rym: Yeah, yeah, so I will watch and wait and I guess in the meantime We'll probably just buy a ps2 and guitar heroes and Okami.

117
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:53,357
Scott: Yeah, the only thing is I'm worried that if we you know We'll buy a ps2 which will be free technically and then we tar heroes will come out Yeah, and then we won't.

118
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:57,454
Scott: then the next guitar hero games will come out for the 360 Which you won't have.

119
00:07:57,574 --> 00:08:01,270
Scott: so we'll have guitar hero 1 & 2 but not we won't be able to get any of the future ones.

120
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:08,810
Rym: But then if they don't release guitar heroes 1 & 2 on the 360 Then we have to get a ps2 anyway because guitar heroes 2 has some great song.

121
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:09,454
Scott: It does.

122
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:11,286
Scott: it really just kind of sucks that you know.

123
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:16,481
Scott: this whole Stop doing.

124
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:16,986
Scott: I can't talk.

125
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:18,110
Rym: talking.

126
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:26,984
Scott: Really sucks to have a series that spans multiple consoles because then if you don't follow those consoles Then you can't get the whole series like Final Fantasy.

127
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:41,243
Rym: Yeah, like Soul Calibur was like 1 2 3 is just on the ps2 It's not gonna be on anything else though I think it's telling that at least as far as I've seen among the general gamer community Soul Calibur 2 is still more popular than Soul.

128
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:42,167
Scott: Calibur.

129
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:42,770
Scott: 3 wasn't so good.

130
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:49,430
Scott: The only thing it added was you can make your own guy, which is pretty cool pretty cool But not worth paying for a game just to make your own guy.

131
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:53,630
Rym: Also, the GameCube is more powerful and yeah, it would have looked better on a GameCube.

132
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,770
Scott: I don't care what it looks like they care how it fights.

133
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,524
Scott: But anyway, I got some other news is going on besides whatever you're talking about.

134
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:01,427
Rym: Well shoot up.

135
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:09,230
Scott: All right, so Everyone knows that this summer PC gaming is gonna get some sort of well this year PC game is gonna get a revival.

136
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,217
Scott: Supposedly spore will come out.

137
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,489
Scott: supposedly supreme commander will come out.

138
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:17,890
Scott: Supposedly a new command and conquer game will come out which I don't care too much about but I'm kind of interested.

139
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,770
Rym: I haven't played a little bit in a long time.

140
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:24,210
Scott: If I'm buying a new computer I might go for it, especially once it gets to that $20 discount rack.

141
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:24,827
Scott: Yeah, you know.

142
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:31,190
Scott: However, the biggest release this year is going to be Half-Life 2 Episode 2.

143
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:38,817
Scott: Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal and Team Fortress 2 are all gonna be one big release by Valve on Steam And it's gonna be huge.

144
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:40,264
Scott: I mean those are three games.

145
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:41,369
Scott: I want to play all of them.

146
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:47,370
Scott: You know I've already got Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episode 1 got to get Episode 2 because the other one was so awesome.

147
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:48,875
Scott: Gonna play Portal cuz.

148
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:52,146
Scott: that's a first-person shooter puzzler that looks just out of this world.

149
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:56,525
Scott: and Team Fortress 2 Be the revival of Team FPS action.

150
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:05,550
Rym: Oh, yeah Team Fortress 2 has the possibility of being the game that will bring that genre of gaming back to the masses.

151
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:17,709
Rym: Yes That's a whole genre a whole segment an important segment a huge segment Once the only segment of online gaming that was of any value or note and it's dead.

152
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:19,156
Rym: now It's gone.

153
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:21,489
Rym: There are kids today who have never played a game like that.

154
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,745
Rym: Yep, and also I think the people making it know exactly what they're doing.

155
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:27,190
Scott: for the videos.

156
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:28,596
Scott: I can only agree with you.

157
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:38,312
Rym: if that is what my the evidence I will judge by I'll give it a 90% chance that this game is going to be probably The destruction of our lives and it you know If no one.

158
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:42,085
Scott: possibly the end of the night even though at the worst possible chance, right?

159
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:44,760
Scott: No one plays this game, but us Still awesome.

160
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:49,009
Scott: Yes, so Here's the news for people like me.

161
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:57,918
Scott: you already have Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 1 and all the mods and everything and Half-Life 2 Episode 1 and Just about every Half-Life thing there is.

162
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,450
Scott: we only want to buy episode 2 portal and Team Fortress 2.

163
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,400
Scott: We don't want to buy anything else because we got it all well.

164
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,334
Scott: valve is going to sell that to me in the black box Which will be PS.

165
00:11:08,656 --> 00:11:09,560
Scott: Well, not PSP.

166
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:11,368
Scott: It was not gonna be on the PSP.

167
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:15,380
Scott: Sorry kids It's gonna be PC only and it's gonna be $40.

168
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,790
Scott: That's a good deal 40 bucks for three games.

169
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,946
Scott: Hell I paid like 15 to 20 bucks for just Half-Life 2 Episode 1.

170
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:28,471
Scott: I paid $65 for Zelda - yeah, I paid 40 bucks for Half-Life 2.

171
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:34,350
Scott: So now I'm paying 40 bucks for a whole episode of Half-Life 2 and portal and Team Fortress 2.

172
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,789
Scott: This is like a steal is the bigger news.

173
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,689
Scott: There's also gonna be the orange box.

174
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,924
Scott: I get the black box because I'm cool and I've already played Half-Life.

175
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:46,103
Scott: but for those of you out there Who are not into the Half-Life already?

176
00:11:46,143 --> 00:11:47,290
Scott: You don't have Half-Life 2.

177
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,990
Scott: Maybe you're like Rym where you would have played Half-Life 2, but you didn't upgrade your computer.

178
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,036
Scott: So now it's finally time to play Half-Life 2.

179
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:55,349
Scott: They're gonna sell you the orange box.

180
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:12,888
Scott: The orange box will come with Half-Life 2 Half-Life 2 Episode 1 Half-Life 2 Episode 2 Portal and Team Fortress 2 and it will be a mere $60 once again less than Mario 3 cost me when it came out for the price of a single Xbox 360 game.

181
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:25,350
Scott: That's brand new for the price of a single ps3 game for only $20 more than I paid for Half-Life 2 Alone, you will get Half-Life 2 Half-Life 2 Episode 1 and 2 portal and Team Fortress.

182
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:35,376
Scott: Not only that but this orange box will be available for the PC the ps3 and the 360.

183
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:35,849
Scott: Holy crap.

184
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:50,344
Rym: Now is there a possibility therefore that I'll be playing online with my computer against in say Team Fortress 2 Against some people using game pads on a 360?

185
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:52,030
Scott: There might be a possibility of that.

186
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,922
Scott: I don't know because no one said anything.

187
00:12:54,083 --> 00:13:10,989
Rym: because if that's true There have been a lot of people lately who don't remember the glory days of FPS and on the computer and they would contend that The non mouse and keyboard controls of an FPS that consoles have is perfectly adequate for a game of that difficulty in caliber and complexity.

188
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:18,370
Rym: and I have never in my life anticipated proving people so wrong so powerfully and so easily.

189
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:23,090
Scott: Well, I think you can technically do it in Halo 1 if I'm not mistaken.

190
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:29,610
Scott: The problem is Halo is designed for the gamepad play and thus the keyboard and mouse doesn't give you a huge advantage.

191
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:31,463
Rym: Yeah, I'd love to see someone try to play.

192
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:32,309
Rym: I don't know mega TF.

193
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:39,228
Scott: It's not enough buttons, but if you're playing weapons factory, you just don't have enough buttons.

194
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:42,842
Scott: god There's no way you'd have to open up menus in order to do anything.

195
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:43,946
Rym: action quake.

196
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:44,468
Scott: Yeah.

197
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:44,789
Scott: Yeah.

198
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:54,570
Scott: But even if that's not a possibility, this is still the awesome especially for people, you know Because all of these games except for Team Fortress are single-player games.

199
00:13:55,192 --> 00:14:09,825
Scott: So even if there isn't gonna be that kind of action if you're a 360 owner or a ps3 owner and You don't want to buy a souped-up computer to play all these games Which are some of the best FPS is ever way better than any of those shit console FPS is.

200
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:11,550
Scott: you're playing like your halos and whatnot.

201
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,575
Rym: Yeah, I mean not to make.

202
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:15,630
Rym: I mean, I'm not disparaging Halo because they're pretty good games.

203
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,704
Rym: But halo 2 for as good as it is is really got nothing on FPS.

204
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,188
Rym: is that came out in the mid 90s?

205
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:31,349
Scott: Yeah So well, maybe the late 90s, okay Yeah, so now all of you will have complete access to the real deal for only 60 bucks.

206
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,966
Scott: You're gonna get freaking one, two, three, four five games.

207
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:38,718
Scott: Holy shit This is like the greatest thing ever.

208
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:41,010
Rym: and never feel bad about playing a game late.

209
00:14:41,492 --> 00:14:45,150
Scott: I mean while I never feel bad about playing a single-player game late.

210
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:50,925
Scott: Yeah multiplayer team fortress - not team fortress late, but playing tribes too late big mistake.

211
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:54,018
Rym: Yeah picking up mega TF now There's one other guy to play with.

212
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,085
Scott: yeah multiplayer games You sort of have to get in when the boat, you know is about to sail.

213
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:03,082
Scott: if it leaves without you You might as well not get on but single-player games.

214
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:04,930
Scott: There's nothing wrong, you know.

215
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:15,390
Scott: I mean if a kid was born today He would have no shame playing Zelda 1 eight years from now because eight years old and he wasn't alive when Zelda 1 was new.

216
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:21,034
Rym: I mean I was playing counter-strike for as long as I was in college and you know All these mods for half-life.

217
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:24,424
Rym: despite that I had never actually played half-life 1.

218
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,190
Rym: I owned it, but I only owned it for mods.

219
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:35,115
Rym: It wasn't until like three years ago when I finally while I was living on co-op and didn't have internet access and lived in the mountains Where even my cell phone didn't work.

220
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:38,006
Rym: I sat down and I played half-life 1.

221
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,030
Scott: it's good, isn't it?

222
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,155
Rym: It's pretty damn good game.

223
00:15:40,195 --> 00:15:40,718
Rym: I must say.

224
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:41,261
Scott: Yeah, it is.

225
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:42,950
Scott: All right, that's enough of my news.

226
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:43,352
Scott: I can.

227
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:45,404
Scott: yeah, sixty bucks five games.

228
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,369
Scott: sixty bucks five games.

229
00:15:53,563 --> 00:16:06,218
Rym: So contrary to what you might have learned in I don't know middle school or high school Especially if you're in our generation, which we were actually alive when the Cold War was still going on Which is weird to say because that wasn't that long ago.

230
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:09,610
Scott: No, it feels like it was a long time ago.

231
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:13,805
Rym: But no, no, I mean parastroic I mean 1989.

232
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:15,331
Rym: I knew exactly what was going on.

233
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:15,913
Scott: I didn't.

234
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,495
Scott: I was a little kid.

235
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:18,882
Scott: I didn't know what the hell's going on Now.

236
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:21,130
Rym: I was politically motivated in fifth grade.

237
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,916
Rym: I was all about Bill Clinton.

238
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:25,124
Rym: I Was and Ross Perot.

239
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,309
Scott: Yeah.

240
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:26,710
Scott: Yeah.

241
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,614
Scott: I don't know.

242
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:28,276
Scott: I didn't care.

243
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:29,200
Scott: I didn't know or care.

244
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:37,919
Rym: I didn't even know right from left until well anyway when I was one in in in Soviet Russia Someone made this little nice.

245
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,900
Rym: You might want to call it a propaganda film except I don't know what I'd call it.

246
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:48,302
Rym: Just a fun little stop-motion animation with all these little matches and it is decidedly Anti-war.

247
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:51,110
Rym: it is definitely peace propaganda.

248
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:51,832
Rym: Mm-hmm.

249
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:54,238
Rym: And also well, it's kind of well done.

250
00:16:54,298 --> 00:17:04,415
Rym: It's kind of funny It's kind of poignant and all I really have to say if you watch it is that peace aside Those blue guys really kind of brought it on themselves and deserved everything they got.

251
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:05,540
Scott: that's what I was gonna say.

252
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,106
Scott: I mean if we learn anything from this.

253
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:10,359
Scott: this video is a green is awesome and blue is assholes.

254
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,375
Rym: Yeah, I mean the green guy was you know, the the border moved a little bit.

255
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:16,267
Rym: the green guy very diligently Just put it right back and everything was okay.

256
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:19,900
Scott: Yeah, the green guy didn't try to push it into the blue area or anything.

257
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,804
Scott: He was a nice guy.

258
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:23,015
Scott: He said oh the border is messed up.

259
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:24,040
Scott: It's not supposed to be like that.

260
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,784
Scott: I'll move it back.

261
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:25,749
Scott: So we're even again.

262
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,685
Scott: then the blue guy was like no fuck you We're gonna take some of your dirt.

263
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:30,234
Rym: and the green guy says hey, you can't do that.

264
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:33,547
Rym: Then the blue guy kills him Yep, and then war escalates.

265
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:42,865
Rym: But yeah, this is a nice little I'll bet a lot of people Maybe people who are older than us Might not have really realized that Despite the fact that the u.s.

266
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:48,160
Rym: Really painted the Soviet Union to be this evil horrible menace of doom and gloom to all the world.

267
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:49,326
Scott: It was kind of bad.

268
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,377
Scott: Yeah, it was but it's not.

269
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:54,265
Rym: it wasn't Consummate evil it just had problems.

270
00:17:54,386 --> 00:18:00,868
Scott: Yeah, I mean it wasn't like everyone in the whole Soviet Union was a horrible evil KGB nutcase.

271
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:11,851
Rym: Yeah, I mean in general While the Soviet Union was very often misguided in many of its policies It's not like they were thinking how can we screw the peasants today?

272
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:12,793
Rym: I dare Trotsky.

273
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:22,000
Rym: I Mean a few people might have been thinking that but most people were At least trying to do some good for their people.

274
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,675
Scott: Yeah, and there are people there in the early 80s making videos like this and it was awesome.

275
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:33,843
Rym: Yeah, this is a good video Yep, and I can't really say anymore, but I'm not gonna ruin what happens, but they're matches Matches.

276
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,499
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty obvious.

277
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,726
Rym: Figure out what's gonna happen.

278
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:40,115
Rym: It took us by surprise and we knew it was coming.

279
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:40,677
Rym: Yeah.

280
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:43,248
Scott: Yeah, it was done So well, it was all right.

281
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,734
Scott: My thing is pretty simple.

282
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:49,237
Scott: It's well, let's see How many times have I talked about Second Life even though I've never played it at all.

283
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:49,679
Scott: in my god.

284
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,193
Rym: So you talk about Second Life and World of Warcraft like there's no tomorrow yet.

285
00:18:53,273 --> 00:18:54,899
Scott: I've never played either of them at all.

286
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:58,758
Scott: Anyway, here's a funny website called get a first life.com.

287
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,369
Scott: It's it's got the same design as I think the Second Life website and at the top of it It says your world.

288
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:07,478
Scott: Sorry about that.

289
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:09,785
Scott: And then they're funny.

290
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:11,330
Scott: It says funny things on the website.

291
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,699
Scott: Like it says go outside membership is free.

292
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:17,879
Scott: First life is a 3d analog world where a server lag does not exist.

293
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:23,239
Scott: Find out where you actually live fornicate using your actual genitals.

294
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,015
Scott: Access your closet to build your first life.

295
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:31,319
Scott: Look Man under 18 get a teen first life.

296
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:51,695
Rym: I just remember back when I still played MMOs and in the realm at my house and I was obsessed with getting stuff to put in my house and it was a big deal when I got a hold of some fancy chrysanthemums and some diamonds and things to put on my floor and on my little trophy case and in my little chest and I was really happy about you know, building up my little house.

297
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:59,000
Rym: now I got a real house and that house there was actually just some bits on a server somewhere not so exciting.

298
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,545
Scott: No, it's funny bit.

299
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:03,534
Scott: we got first life questions, we've got answers.

300
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:05,280
Scott: our five cents is enough.

301
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:07,011
Scott: What's this body thing?

302
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:08,299
Scott: And what do I do with the dangly bits?

303
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:13,316
Scott: Why can't I build a dirigible?

304
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:17,709
Scott: with my mind Penguins spoons and you?

305
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:19,500
Scott: what's life like among the flightless?

306
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,960
Scott: You know, I think I've just read the entire website because you can't really click on anything on this website.

307
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:26,369
Scott: None of it will take you anywhere.

308
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:28,100
Rym: Oh, so it's one of those joke websites.

309
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,806
Scott: Yeah, I mean you can click.

310
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:33,800
Scott: dig this you can click the credits to see the guys who made it.

311
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:35,712
Rym: You know what in general there's.

312
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:37,000
Rym: I've seen jokes like that before.

313
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:42,260
Rym: It's a good way to go because a joke like that if taken to more depth becomes increasingly less funny.

314
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:47,033
Scott: Yeah, it's like if this actually that you know at the top there's a menu that's like what.

315
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:47,754
Scott: what is life?

316
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:49,820
Scott: showcase business partners developers?

317
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,238
Scott: If those actually went to different sites if you could actually log into this and do stuff.

318
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:56,304
Scott: It would just become a.

319
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,931
Rym: there's only one site that's ever gotten away with that?

320
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:02,240
Rym: maybe two but high space yeah high space.

321
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,400
Rym: Anyway, you get a which I wonder if that's updated.

322
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,143
Rym: I haven't been there.

323
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:10,880
Scott: like there is one link actually besides dig this and the credits that actually works.

324
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:12,606
Scott: It's the webs.

325
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:16,120
Scott: It's the link to cafe press where you can buy first life merchandise.

326
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:25,825
Scott: Really yes, really Well, you know what it's right under the fornicate using your actual genitals link Which doesn't go anywhere.

327
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:28,395
Rym: good job because that's the one people are gonna try to click on.

328
00:21:28,435 --> 00:21:31,549
Rym: while they're clicking furiously They'll probably accidentally hit that store link.

329
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,197
Rym: Yeah, and then they'll get excited.

330
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:33,840
Scott: It's pretty big.

331
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,446
Scott: It's got some pictures of t-shirts on it.

332
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:42,299
Scott: Yeah, whatever the funniest thing is you should go to the website Just look at it for a second to see all the kids that they have on the front page.

333
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:52,059
Rym: So in the board gaming war gaming world if you don't exist in this world or have a presence there You probably don't even know what we're gonna talk about, but that's good because you're gonna learn something.

334
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:58,980
Rym: So we're going to talk about Battle lore which has been all the rage in the board gaming war gaming community.

335
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:02,589
Scott: Yeah, this game went from a game that wasn't out yet.

336
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,120
Scott: Let's see where this game is on the top board game geek games.

337
00:22:07,341 --> 00:22:08,204
Scott: Oh, let's see.

338
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:12,860
Scott: This game that wasn't even out months ago is now number five on board game.

339
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,000
Scott: geek.

340
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,413
Scott: That's pretty damn good, you know going from nothing to five immediately.

341
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:20,040
Rym: now this game has brought.

342
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:23,259
Rym: It's a war game, but it's not like a lot of other war games.

343
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,782
Rym: It's very much in the same vein as battle cry or memoir 44.

344
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:29,164
Scott: Well, it's.

345
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:30,270
Scott: it uses the come.

346
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,259
Scott: Richard Borg is the guy who designed it.

347
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:43,251
Scott: oh, oh, he's the guy who designed the command and colors system, which is also used in memoir 44 and Commanding colors ancients and another game that I forget battle cry.

348
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:43,773
Scott: Yeah.

349
00:22:44,234 --> 00:22:44,374
Rym: Yeah.

350
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:46,240
Rym: These games are basically the basic mechanic.

351
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:56,760
Rym: I mean war games in general tend to be along the lines of you have units You move them around by a set of rules Command them by a set of rules and fight with them by a set of rules.

352
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:05,136
Rym: the fighting could range from looking up things and tables to rolling dice to Drawing abstract lines on a piece of paper and seeing which ones get crossed off.

353
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:06,100
Rym: all sorts of different ways.

354
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:13,271
Rym: these things work, but the purpose is to simulate tactical strategic or Tactical strategic war play yet.

355
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,460
Scott: You want to simulate military tactics?

356
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:24,894
Scott: so the people playing the game feel like military commanders on some level be it a squad or giant armies across the entire world.

357
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:32,519
Scott: and you know simulate having guys fight and die and kill other guys and you know It's my guys versus your guys.

358
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:45,740
Rym: now a lot of war games are broken down into grid hex games where you have units on hexes that move around or The more popular in some circles, but also more hated in the same in some circles the kind of freeform games.

359
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,320
Rym: We have miniatures and you put the miniatures in terrain.

360
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:54,236
Scott: Yeah, you got stuff, you know, the war games also include stuff like risk and dice wars even.

361
00:23:54,256 --> 00:24:00,469
Rym: Yeah advanced wars Warhammer 40k Battle system battle tech all that.

362
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,080
Rym: but this game is definitely designed to be simple.

363
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:07,600
Rym: This is a war game that anyone could pick up and learn in about five minutes.

364
00:24:08,122 --> 00:24:12,340
Rym: This is not a complex difficult to learn onerous war game.

365
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:21,000
Rym: You're not going to be sitting there with a tape measure Trying to figure out if your skirmishers can make it the four inches through the woods to attack the wolf riders.

366
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,052
Scott: Yeah, it's also a very short war game.

367
00:24:25,112 --> 00:24:28,963
Scott: Whereas if you play something like Shogun or Warhammer.

368
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:31,172
Scott: you could be sitting there for a very long time.

369
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:33,240
Scott: battle tech takes hours and hours to play.

370
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:45,060
Rym: You know, you could be sitting there for some war games take days to play that battle system a Large battle in battle system could easily take four hours and that's if everyone knows what you're doing and you're using the simple rules.

371
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:45,546
Rym: Yeah

372
00:24:45,628 --> 00:25:00,880
Scott: battle lore even a simple game Even the very complex game of battle lore will take an hour a little over an hour depending on you know if anyone if Everyone tries to hold back and to let because it's you play until you kill a certain number of guys.

373
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,308
Scott: So if everyone plays very defensively, it'll take longer.

374
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:06,480
Scott: Yeah, but it's sort of impossible to not fight.

375
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:09,358
Scott: So the game doesn't take very long at all.

376
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:16,097
Rym: but this basic mechanic that runs through all these games that we're talking about right now and battle lore is the newest iteration of This is very simple.

377
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:28,220
Rym: you will have by some means a number of cards and these cards allow you you like you'll have a hand of cards and Each card whichever one you play allows you to give orders to a certain number or type of your units.

378
00:25:28,782 --> 00:25:38,840
Rym: So say you'll have a card that says order two units on the right side of the board or Order all your units in the center or order all your green units and you take turns.

379
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:45,020
Rym: So I play a card order all my green units Scott plays a card order all my cavalry and we go back and forth.

380
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:52,026
Rym: So instead of moving all your units every round you move a subset that you have to choose Tactically from a hand that you've drawn

381
00:25:52,307 --> 00:25:59,236
Scott: and this is why this is a big reason why the game doesn't take very long because you Don't have people, you know, usually in a war game.

382
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:05,520
Scott: It's like, alright It's my turn now and now I spend 15 minutes to a half hour moving all my stuff.

383
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:14,427
Scott: Like if you play advance or is on a big map Someone's turn usually takes like five minutes because they're going all around this map looking for every single unit They haven't used and where to move it.

384
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:20,460
Scott: and you know thinking all this stuff out in this game on your turn At most you're not gonna move so many units.

385
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,664
Scott: You're never gonna move all of them.

386
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:26,020
Scott: most turns most of your units just sit there doing nothing because you can't order them.

387
00:26:26,527 --> 00:26:32,058
Scott: So you just you know You pick which guys you're gonna move and you move them and those are the only guys you have to worry about.

388
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:36,431
Scott: so your turn Is very quick So no one is sitting around waiting for a long time.

389
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:44,880
Scott: and also because your turns are so quick The game doesn't take very long because you can take a lot of turns very quickly And it only takes so many turns for the games to be over.

390
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:51,260
Rym: Now if battle or is basically the same as all these other games only with a different theme Why is this game the hotness?

391
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:57,420
Rym: Why is this game being lauded while the other games in the system while popular were never near this level of popularity?

392
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,289
Scott: Well, I can figure out two reasons But I think the biggest reason is the theme.

393
00:27:02,591 --> 00:27:07,269
Scott: the theme of battle lore is heavy Thick rich and awesome.

394
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:09,940
Rym: It is basically the hundred years war.

395
00:27:10,622 --> 00:27:15,580
Rym: Only it is the hundred years war in a world where there is some degree of magic.

396
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:25,580
Scott: Yes now their first two or so adventures adventures in the book That come the book of adventures that comes with the game are medieval adventures.

397
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:31,646
Scott: they're Agincourt and first chef O'Shea, whatever you call it and There's no magic.

398
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:34,680
Scott: There's no goblins or dwarves or giant spiders.

399
00:27:35,062 --> 00:27:51,120
Scott: It's just military guys fighting and those are meant as the introductory Battles for new players because if you don't know the command and color system already That's a great way to learn without having to worry about the complicated rules of Goblins and dwarves and giant spiders and magic spells.

400
00:27:51,368 --> 00:28:00,620
Rym: So yeah The theme is definitely drawing people because the hundred years war has been at least for war gamers an object of fascination Much like the Napoleonic Wars and the Gallic Wars.

401
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:05,999
Scott: Another thing that I think people are drawing to this game is that the production value of the game is very high.

402
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,567
Scott: now There's a problem with the first print.

403
00:28:07,627 --> 00:28:13,196
Rym: run in the dice, but now you can get better dice for free Yeah, and if you get ahold of the old one, they'll send you better dice.

404
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:24,340
Scott: They'll help you out Yep, and also this game sort of has like aspects of Collectible card games and aspects of miniatures games without actually being collect.

405
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:39,320
Scott: It's not a game of who spends the most money wins, you know or you need to spend a certain amount of money to get the stuff you want because there isn't sort of a Construct your army mechanic where you know, you pick the best bits to make your army like there would be in Warhammer or something.

406
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:40,207
Rym: Yeah, it's more.

407
00:28:40,248 --> 00:28:53,964
Rym: it's more that this game is very Expandable and you can get or make or whatever expansions that modify the rules or add units or add difficulty or add players or change units or do something to Make the game different.

408
00:28:54,004 --> 00:29:00,920
Rym: So anytime you get tired of the game, it would be trivial to go pick up one of these Many myriad expansions that are likely going to be coming out.

409
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,160
Scott: Yeah, I mean when I bought the game they gave me a hill giant with the game.

410
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,930
Scott: So in the box is the giant spider that was the only monster.

411
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:12,670
Scott: then they gave me the hill giant and then when I bought The dice on I didn't buy them for I got the dice online.

412
00:29:13,072 --> 00:29:15,600
Scott: They gave me the earth elemental, you know.

413
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,986
Scott: And they keep adding creatures.

414
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:18,674
Scott: I'm sure they'll add more units.

415
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:20,000
Scott: They'll add more maps.

416
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,950
Scott: They're gonna add all kinds of stuff to this game.

417
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:22,775
Rym: now more importantly.

418
00:29:22,815 --> 00:29:23,740
Rym: I said it was expandable.

419
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:25,939
Rym: It's not just that there are expansions like this.

420
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:33,724
Rym: It's more that the way the game is written and the way the rules work is very conducive to easily adding Expansions.

421
00:29:33,784 --> 00:29:36,440
Rym: it's kind of like a program that has hooks for other programs.

422
00:29:36,962 --> 00:29:42,420
Rym: It has hooks built into the rules to make it trivial to add rules without breaking anything.

423
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:49,326
Scott: Yeah For example a lot of the specific rules of the game are on these cards and the cut the root It's all everywhere in the instruction manual.

424
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:53,777
Scott: It says if a rule is on a card that overrides a rule in the book.

425
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,027
Scott: now How can I explain this?

426
00:29:57,689 --> 00:30:01,660
Scott: in the array in the game that comes in the box of battle or without any expansions?

427
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:06,855
Scott: There are a total of four different weapons the units might have you know as normal units might have.

428
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:11,911
Scott: there's the short sword the long Sword the bow and some dwarves had the crossbow.

429
00:30:12,232 --> 00:30:14,620
Rym: Yeah, and there's just a card for each one of these items.

430
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:19,980
Rym: So whichever what you want a unit has the rules for that item are just on this card in front of you, right?

431
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:33,957
Scott: So it would be very easy to say make a bunch of miniatures that had Spears and then in that box of miniatures with Spears you put a card that says Longspear and it has the rules for the long spear on it.

432
00:30:34,058 --> 00:30:37,603
Scott: And now Congratulations, you've expanded the game So kind of.

433
00:30:37,623 --> 00:30:48,539
Rym: what you do when you play a game of this is you take all the relevant rules cards for whatever you're doing which there's a standard set that comes with the game and you lay them out alongside the board and it's kind of like.

434
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,760
Rym: you have Constructed the full rule book for this individual battle that you're having right now.

435
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you're playing a game and on the map for this particular adventure, it's a mountainous map.

436
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:05,180
Scott: So you take the elevated terrain rules card and you put it down in case you remember the rules for elevated terrain.

437
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:07,053
Scott: But there's no forest in this hill.

438
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:07,999
Scott: It's it's a snowy hill.

439
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:15,400
Scott: so you take the Forest card that has the rules for forest tiles and you put it in the box because you don't need to look at it.

440
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:26,873
Rym: Yep so basically you have instead of a reference book you have a Play every time you play Which is kind of neat.

441
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:27,740
Rym: I like this mechanic.

442
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:30,910
Scott: Yeah, another thing about this game is it sort of bridges.

443
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,544
Scott: the miniatures gap is all the miniatures are plain gray plastic so it's sort of ink.

444
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:44,850
Scott: it's sort of like this bridge between like a war board game like Shogun or something and Like a war hammer, you know, it's like.

445
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:45,855
Scott: ah, here's the miniatures.

446
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:46,940
Scott: you could paint them if you want.

447
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:48,847
Scott: You can buy more if you want.

448
00:31:49,048 --> 00:31:50,674
Rym: I would recommend against painting them.

449
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:56,176
Rym: while they're fairly high quality They are not the type of miniature that would be easy or fun to paint.

450
00:31:56,257 --> 00:32:00,760
Scott: Well, I don't know I'm not big on miniatures painting mostly because I don't have the skill or the time to do.

451
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,085
Rym: I painted a few in my day.

452
00:32:02,105 --> 00:32:02,627
Rym: that turned out.

453
00:32:02,728 --> 00:32:03,109
Rym: Okay.

454
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,840
Rym: I have some friends who were absolutely amazing at it.

455
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,860
Scott: Yeah, but I look at some of these pictures of people who did paint them on board game geek and they're fairly impressive.

456
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:22,280
Scott: Oh, yeah, I guess if you have the skills and you're already a miniatures painting type of person Battle or is not so bad mostly because you got a whole lot of miniatures for relatively little money.

457
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,269
Scott: I mean this game is 70 something bucks.

458
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:25,876
Scott: You could probably get it for like high 60s.

459
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,869
Rym: I've seen it a lot of people about it for 50 online.

460
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:30,575
Scott: No, maybe on eBay or something.

461
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:36,605
Rym: No on straight-up websites I forget the exact name of them, but all the board game geek people were like, yeah Why would anyone pay more than 50 bucks for this?

462
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:37,006
Scott: Yeah.

463
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:37,428
Scott: Hmm.

464
00:32:37,949 --> 00:32:39,634
Rym: Anyway, plus $10 shipping.

465
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:41,179
Scott: Oh, well, there you go.

466
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,960
Scott: But yeah, no, but if your main interest is miniatures painting you probably don't want to buy this just for miniatures painting.

467
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,123
Scott: But if you might want to think about miniatures painting and you also want to play battle or not a bad idea Well, you know what?

468
00:32:56,223 --> 00:33:02,372
Rym: It'd be a good thing to learn a little bit on just because you wouldn't worry about messing these pieces Up, they're not the highest of quality.

469
00:33:02,392 --> 00:33:03,640
Scott: Yeah, and there's so many of them.

470
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:09,038
Scott: It's like, you know You go buy Warhammer you buy a pack with like maybe five little dudes or one big dude.

471
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:11,459
Scott: here You get a box with like a hundred dudes in it.

472
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,040
Rym: Well, there's also the issue that in this game the miniatures themselves don't mean anything.

473
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:17,279
Rym: All that matters is the number of them on a hex.

474
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:22,380
Rym: Yeah And the type of unit has nothing to do with the miniature like it would in a normal war game.

475
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:25,400
Rym: It only has to do with the banner that's on the set of units.

476
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:30,620
Scott: Yeah The miniatures and the actual look at the miniatures in this game is all flavor and this game is heavy with the flavor.

477
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,240
Scott: You got the flavor text the flavor miniatures the flavor tiles.

478
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:37,980
Rym: I'll admit that I've been mostly ignoring the flavor and just playing the straight-up tactical game.

479
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:39,447
Rym: Yeah, I've been paying.

480
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:41,960
Rym: I don't even segregate the proper kinds of miniatures.

481
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,994
Rym: I just throw down a little gray guys and put banners on them and go.

482
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:53,983
Scott: I haven't been paying to the As much attention to the flavor as the book would have you but I have been paying attention to it because it is it's kind Of fun.

483
00:33:54,185 --> 00:33:55,720
Scott: It's like oh, I'm moving a little spider.

484
00:33:56,604 --> 00:34:00,340
Rym: Now more importantly we don't need to get into many of the details of the game.

485
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,440
Rym: You can read all that online.

486
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:01,983
Rym: You can watch.

487
00:34:02,204 --> 00:34:04,820
Rym: if you really want to see how this game works check out board games with Scott.

488
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:10,239
Scott: Yeah, if you go to boardgameswithscott.com there's a video this guy shows you the basics of how this game works.

489
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,339
Scott: He doesn't go into the advanced rules, but he goes into enough rules that you understand what's going on.

490
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,614
Rym: Yeah, because there is one other thing we didn't talk about.

491
00:34:16,635 --> 00:34:17,219
Rym: what we'll get to that?

492
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,849
Rym: But the game itself.

493
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,126
Rym: if you've ever played there's this old game I think was called battle system.

494
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:28,266
Rym: that came with a big vinyl mat and had all these hexes on it and It plays almost the same as this game.

495
00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:29,491
Scott: Yeah, I never played the game.

496
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:29,913
Scott: So, I don't know.

497
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:39,414
Rym: it plays almost exactly the same with minor differences and Therein lies the point of contention between myself and other pretty much everyone else.

498
00:34:39,454 --> 00:35:00,400
Rym: We know and Scott who stands alone in that Battle-lore is fun and battle-lore is well done and I think battle-lore has a lot of potential especially with the fact that you can expand The game but I do believe that the current game as it is now is Has enough randomness in it to the point that any individual victory or loss means very little.

499
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:02,245
Scott: Well, yeah, I will.

500
00:35:02,445 --> 00:35:06,580
Scott: I'm not going to dispute the fact that battle-lore it is not a German game.

501
00:35:06,881 --> 00:35:07,965
Scott: It is not a heavy game.

502
00:35:07,985 --> 00:35:09,471
Scott: It is not a deep game.

503
00:35:09,652 --> 00:35:11,258
Rym: It is a game for like 12 and up.

504
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,651
Scott: Well, it says on the box like 10 and up, right?

505
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,579
Scott: I guess 12 and up would be good, too.

506
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:18,532
Scott: But yeah, this is not a game.

507
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:19,640
Scott: That is a heavy hitter.

508
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:23,500
Scott: It is very light, which is why it only takes an hour and the rules are simple.

509
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,859
Scott: I mean the book of the rules is big and impressive, but really it's not all that complex.

510
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:35,080
Scott: Especially if you played a command-and-colors game before It's not exactly the hardest game.

511
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:44,040
Rym: Yeah, in fact if you played one of these games before this adds just one thing really Yeah, any middle school kid can play this game with ease without messing it up ever.

512
00:35:44,762 --> 00:35:54,415
Scott: So if you are the kind of person like Rym who can only seem to have fun in a game That is very very deep and difficult No, it's not even that.

513
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:56,420
Rym: it's not that the game has to be very deep.

514
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,679
Rym: It's that it has to be deep enough for me to get my foot wet.

515
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:06,380
Rym: God damn, I think this game is so close to being everything I've wanted in a war game ever.

516
00:36:06,922 --> 00:36:15,165
Rym: It's so close and I really wanted to like it and a lot of people could tweak this game But I think they go after the wrong things like for example the card drafting thing.

517
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:19,827
Rym: you'll have four or five cards in your hand and That really limits what you can do on the board.

518
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:31,920
Rym: and while that can be annoying and while there is in Individual hands the individual games a lot of randomness there It's mitigated at least partly by the fact that you're an intelligent human being who can make decisions.

519
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:45,039
Rym: And also it is a fairly elegant way to kind of abstract fog of war and difficulty of giving orders and delays of Communication and all those things that happen in a battle without having to have individual mechanics for all of them.

520
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:52,600
Rym: The card drafting thing on its own does not hurt this game very much And in fact, I'd say that that's one of the best strengths of this game is how the card drafting works.

521
00:36:53,782 --> 00:37:02,460
Rym: but in addition to that combat is all resolved with dice and Just for the scale of the number of dice used versus the number of hits it takes to kill a unit.

522
00:37:03,302 --> 00:37:13,276
Rym: Luck can factor extremely heavily into sudden victories and defeats and I have won in lost battles very obviously Simply from one roll of the dice.

523
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:20,312
Scott: Yeah I mean there are ways that you can play to get you know Plus one dice here minus one dice for the other guy there die.

524
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:32,560
Scott: Yeah die for the other guy there, but When it seems whenever anyone rolls the dice most of the time It's just you miss because to hit is so incredibly difficult unless you're in such an advantageous position on the board.

525
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:40,369
Rym: Yeah, I mean on a normal unit against a normal unit you pretty much have to roll one Space of a six-sided die to do any damage.

526
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:44,000
Scott: Yeah, it's like you have a dice die and only one side will hit.

527
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:49,190
Scott: So it's basically roll a d6 on a one you hit on anything else You don't hit but four hits kills a unit.

528
00:37:49,491 --> 00:37:51,260
Rym: and say you have a unit who rolls four dice.

529
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:56,580
Rym: There have been times where a powerful unit was suddenly wiped out by a random lucky roll.

530
00:37:56,861 --> 00:38:05,409
Scott: Yeah, I mean, let's say you've got I don't know a mounted unit a red mounted unit Which is very powerful and it can pursue.

531
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:08,680
Scott: so let's say it comes in on someone and you give it a plus one.

532
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:10,511
Scott: You use a card to give it plus one.

533
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:11,920
Scott: So it rolls five dice.

534
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:14,688
Scott: Let's say gets two hits and a flag.

535
00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:24,920
Scott: that unit gets loses half of itself and is forced to retreat Now that he can pursue and attack again, it's just like up you're dead when normally it's so difficult to hit.

536
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:31,560
Scott: So it really gets frustrating when when a unit battles either nothing happens or it just dies.

537
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:34,300
Scott: There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of in-between.

538
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:35,083
Rym: Yeah.

539
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:38,500
Rym: couple this with the fact that this is a full strength till the end game.

540
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,980
Rym: This is a game where no matter how damaged a unit is it fights at 100% full power until it is destroyed.

541
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,875
Scott: All right, so if I have that number I was just talking about a red mounted longsword unit.

542
00:38:49,297 --> 00:38:50,360
Scott: it's very powerful unit.

543
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:53,260
Scott: Let's say it's been damaged by some archers pretty heavily.

544
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:57,056
Scott: It can attack just as ferociously as it could at the beginning of the game.

545
00:38:57,177 --> 00:38:57,840
Scott: It doesn't matter.

546
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,711
Scott: It's full offensive strength until it's dead.

547
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:02,780
Scott: when at which point it has no offensive strength.

548
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:05,340
Rym: Now even that would be okay with me.

549
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:08,000
Rym: See my problem is that the game is so close to being good.

550
00:39:08,341 --> 00:39:10,628
Rym: But the card thing is okay on its own.

551
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:17,400
Rym: and even the card thing plus the dice thing are okay on their own because While they're both kind of random in the end, they do kind of even out.

552
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,305
Scott: Yeah And you know when you really look at those the card thing and the dice thing What they really.

553
00:39:22,345 --> 00:39:26,360
Scott: if you start looking at the numbers they just abstract, you know, like look at risk, right?

554
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,920
Scott: Risk is not a game of you know, you're either dead or you didn't get hurt at all.

555
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,119
Scott: It's a. it's a game of slowly get hurt slowly get hurt slowly get hurt.

556
00:39:34,642 --> 00:39:42,040
Scott: But it's also based on dice and while the odds of those dice might be a little different You know and drawn out over time and it makes the game feel different.

557
00:39:42,602 --> 00:39:45,974
Scott: It really is just you roll the dice and someone wins and someone dies.

558
00:39:46,054 --> 00:39:46,335
Scott: It's just.

559
00:39:46,576 --> 00:39:52,873
Scott: this game is so Abstracted to make it so much more simple that it just does everything.

560
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:55,060
Scott: risk does in 20 minutes in one second.

561
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:57,689
Rym: but that also gives you the problem of you.

562
00:39:57,709 --> 00:40:03,959
Rym: strategically you don't have many options because if there's one Unlucky roll suddenly your whole strategy is boned.

563
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:07,935
Rym: But because of the way the game is you have no you understand it's boned.

564
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,447
Rym: you have no way out You have no way to remaneuver.

565
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:11,854
Rym: You have no way to reconfigure.

566
00:40:11,914 --> 00:40:13,080
Rym: It's just suddenly everything's done.

567
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:24,568
Rym: Yeah and it happened so quickly that every time I win I feel like any other intelligent person playing my side would have made the exact same decisions I made or Very close and the outcome would have been the same.

568
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:31,302
Rym: and every time I lost I felt like I was playing as best as I Could and anyone else sitting here would have played almost the exact same moves I played.

569
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:33,210
Rym: as long as they were reasonably intelligent.

570
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,440
Rym: and I think our friend Pete said it very well.

571
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:54,059
Rym: It was either Peter wide who said that this game is like playing Warhammer on a 12 by 12 grade In that you have units and you feel like oh I'd like to send my cavalry around those woods to hide and wait and then ambush while my archers come up from this side Or have some sort of even short-term minor strategy.

572
00:40:54,883 --> 00:41:11,180
Rym: But because the hexes are so big and there are so few of them and because the rules of movement make it very difficult to move very far and Just in general you have very little actual maneuverability and in most cases any tactical movement you make is obvious.

573
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:13,547
Rym: There is obviously a place you want to be.

574
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:23,140
Rym: put that blue infantry on that hill put those archers in that wood Put those archers behind those two dwarves to make them double bold circle around back.

575
00:41:23,422 --> 00:41:26,020
Rym: Like I never have to make any significant decisions.

576
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,936
Rym: It's just obvious what the best thing to do is on the back of the board.

577
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:37,223
Scott: if you flip it over there is another half of a map with small with slightly smaller hexes on it and They have been.

578
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:55,060
Scott: they're obviously going to make an expansion for like epic play that may or may not include options for more than two players playing at once and It you know will obviously be where you combine two boards together to make one bigger board with you know More hexes and more of that action.

579
00:41:55,642 --> 00:41:59,175
Scott: But yet the compared to other games like what else?

580
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:00,238
Scott: what the games can I think of?

581
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:13,659
Scott: I mean just battle tech where there's a whole lot of hexes and you can move around a whole lot and there's all sorts of action Battle lore for as short as the game plays you don't really move very far in that short time.

582
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,823
Scott: yet You fight a lot.

583
00:42:15,104 --> 00:42:18,900
Scott: It's a lot less moving and a lot more fighting and the fighting is dice rolling

584
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:30,760
Rym: Yeah, and those three things together the lack of actual tactical maneuverability the fact that the dice are very random and the fact that the cards Are also random leaves me feeling very unsatisfied when I play.

585
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:51,059
Rym: I mean, I I would much rather spend the extra time to play Shogun than to play a game like this because Shogun is while there is still randomness of the dice because other aspects of the game are more deterministic and because you have more maneuverability and Options but not so many options to be paralyzed the game feels so much more solid to me.

586
00:42:51,594 --> 00:43:00,751
Scott: Yeah I think the reason that I still like this game even though I agree with pretty much everything that Rym said is Because when I play a war game, I'm not looking for like like.

587
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:12,400
Scott: I don't find war games fun for you know Military tactics and strategy because I don't know much about military tactics and strategy and I don't care I don't think about oh, I'll flank those guys or I'll go hook around those guys from behind.

588
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:20,473
Scott: I think ooh, I'm moving guys around and they're gonna fight You know, so when I play advance oars, you know, I just move my guys around.

589
00:43:20,513 --> 00:43:22,198
Rym: that's why you always lose it.

590
00:43:22,258 --> 00:43:25,509
Scott: advance wars Yeah, I mean if I'm if I want a game of.

591
00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:28,560
Scott: you know strategies and and you know big thinking.

592
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:36,290
Scott: I go to my German games because those are the kind of games that have things that I enjoy thinking about and that I can Grasp and then I like that.

593
00:43:36,713 --> 00:43:39,973
Scott: but when I'm playing a war game It's because I like to move guys around and I like to fight.

594
00:43:40,154 --> 00:43:42,317
Rym: so I'm actually curious What other war games have you played?

595
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:48,769
Rym: axis and allies risk battle tag All right, so you played mostly bad war games.

596
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:50,755
Rym: shogun is okay, but shogun is more is not.

597
00:43:51,217 --> 00:43:52,280
Rym: shogun is a special case.

598
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:54,157
Rym: It's a very interesting game.

599
00:43:54,822 --> 00:43:58,015
Scott: Vance or is a couple of PC games.

600
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:02,699
Rym: advance wars is Pretty much the minimum level of tactical thought I can deal with.

601
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:17,121
Scott: Problem see the thing is it's like every time I think about battle or you know, it's like, uh, yeah They made these dice random, you know, and but you look at advance wars and say alright advance wars the gate the combat is deterministic There's.

602
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:32,726
Scott: no there's barely any randomness in the combat and you say wasn't wasn't wasn't wasn't wasn't Randomness in the combat of battle lore then that would mean that everyone would spend a lot more time thinking to a. you know Before you actually fight figure out you know What the best combat was.

603
00:44:32,786 --> 00:44:32,906
Scott: see.

604
00:44:32,947 --> 00:44:36,100
Rym: now to me the easy way to solve that is the same way you solve it in German games.

605
00:44:37,322 --> 00:44:48,438
Rym: You just play a game where you've got to make a decision and if you can't think quickly enough and Reasonable, I give someone a minute, but you just don't let people sit there and I know I know that I know.

606
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:49,724
Scott: that's that I would agree.

607
00:44:49,784 --> 00:44:52,760
Scott: However war games tend to be anti bevaca.

608
00:44:52,780 --> 00:45:02,500
Scott: I mean you watch guys playing miniatures games and war games and places and For them it seems to be all about taking as much time on your turn as possible and thinking about all this stuff.

609
00:45:03,323 --> 00:45:16,119
Rym: Whenever I played war games, I always forced myself to think quickly because in the real world I wouldn't have had the luxury to sit there for an hour Measuring the distances between all my troops to figure out if they're actually cohesive or if they're gonna be routed when those riders

610
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,320
Scott: come.

611
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,502
Scott: Yeah, that seems to be what war gamers are all about though And we're not.

612
00:45:19,763 --> 00:45:24,720
Scott: that's the problem is that we're not war gamers, but sometimes we like to play a war game or two.

613
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:34,989
Scott: So it's very difficult because the war games that war gamers like with their crayons and you know They're little painted tanks and stuff like that We really can't get into very much.

614
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:43,060
Scott: or the games that are like, you know Really thick with historical accuracy while we might like the historical ness are very difficult for us to play.

615
00:45:43,524 --> 00:45:45,180
Rym: See, I like them a lot more.

616
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:48,450
Rym: I mean I guess battle lore is just a little bit below my line.

617
00:45:48,972 --> 00:46:06,564
Rym: if the hexes were have if there were twice as many hexes on the board and if the game had one more tactical element just one more like Troop formations like say my infantry could switch between a line a column and a square Anything like that?

618
00:46:07,006 --> 00:46:09,335
Rym: I think that would be enough to make this game bearable to me.

619
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:10,680
Scott: Yeah, it does.

620
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:11,302
Scott: I do a good.

621
00:46:11,322 --> 00:46:19,960
Scott: they just aren't enough decisions to make and often like, you know When you have a decision that you can make like oh, should I do this or do that?

622
00:46:20,441 --> 00:46:22,007
Scott: It's usually not one or the other.

623
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:29,076
Scott: it's usually either yes or no and the answer is almost always yes Because you should do whatever you can to get ahead because the game is gonna be over soon.

624
00:46:29,096 --> 00:46:34,635
Rym: do something Yeah, but also one time I played and there was nothing I could do about it.

625
00:46:34,695 --> 00:46:40,120
Rym: I just got dicked by the cards and While I think the cards are a cool mechanic and I'm not saying we should change that.

626
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:50,080
Rym: It was just the fact that I drew pretty much no useful cards And in fact, I drew cards that I couldn't use effectively at all for the first like seven turns of one battle.

627
00:46:50,362 --> 00:46:59,920
Scott: Yeah, I do like the cards a lot But I do feel like they could have made this card deck like bigger more varied and more kind of balanced.

628
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:02,588
Scott: You know, it's like alright, I can understand.

629
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:03,311
Scott: you have this card.

630
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:11,334
Scott: This is Scout, you know move one unit on the left All right But you also Get to draw two and keep one instead of just drawing one at the end of your turn.

631
00:47:11,374 --> 00:47:12,378
Scott: that that seems pretty.

632
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:13,223
Scott: that's a nice Balance.

633
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:19,537
Scott: you move less units which kind of sucks But you get an advantage and now you're gonna have a better chance of getting the cards you want next time.

634
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:29,447
Rym: now Consider that can just imagine this because this is similar to a variant I came up with as a kid for a battle system Which was you battle system.

635
00:47:29,468 --> 00:47:30,090
Scott: I just looked up.

636
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,335
Scott: is that is the D&D thing?

637
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:32,279
Scott: It's not what you're thinking of.

638
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,347
Scott: You're thinking I think battle masters battle masters.

639
00:47:34,608 --> 00:47:37,760
Rym: I confused the two because I played battle system with pieces of cardboard.

640
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,220
Scott: I'm gonna look up battle masters right now and battle masters.

641
00:47:40,341 --> 00:47:44,740
Rym: I just played all the time somewhat incorrectly because we just mess all the units up and have a big brawl.

642
00:47:45,840 --> 00:48:00,279
Rym: But the variant I came up with was the difference between that game and this game was that instead of Each person having a hand of five cards you shuffle this deck that has movement cards for both sides And then you draw them one by one so you don't even know what order your units are gonna come up in.

643
00:48:01,122 --> 00:48:07,300
Rym: What if you had a drafting mechanism where you have a hand of cards and you are allowed to put X of them into the?

644
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:07,881
Rym: Communal deck?

645
00:48:08,243 --> 00:48:10,752
Rym: the other person is allowed to put X of them into the communal deck.

646
00:48:11,073 --> 00:48:13,426
Rym: you shuffle them and then bring them up One-by-one.

647
00:48:13,466 --> 00:48:14,819
Rym: so now you have a race condition.

648
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:22,020
Rym: Now you have a situation where you're choosing What situation you want to put yourself into or what options you want to give yourself?

649
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,339
Rym: But due to the fog of war you can't determine the order in which they will take place.

650
00:48:26,942 --> 00:48:28,569
Scott: Yeah, they're like the other.

651
00:48:28,689 --> 00:48:36,980
Scott: like I was gonna say you have the scout card, okay on its own It seems balanced, but then you compare it to some of the other cards in the deck such as move to in each sector.

652
00:48:37,141 --> 00:48:46,400
Scott: Okay, so that's not really even if you know you draw one card and it allows you to move one unit And another card may be like there'll be a card in there that says move to on the left.

653
00:48:46,663 --> 00:48:47,700
Scott: There's also a card in there.

654
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,880
Scott: This is move to on the left to in the middle and two on the right.

655
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:58,634
Scott: So it's like how is that if someone draws the cards that let them move a lot of units and the other guy gets a car Get all the cards that let him move very few.

656
00:48:58,997 --> 00:48:59,825
Rym: last game We play.

657
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:15,820
Scott: it'll be very easy for the person who can move a lot of units to keep their units in tight formation and Because the only units that you can order can attack I mean, let's say I get all threes and Rym gets all twos I can attack him three times a turn and he can attack me two times a turn.

658
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:22,020
Rym: Well in the last game we played my starting hand of five and I had a bunch of cavalry and a bunch of good archers.

659
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:27,900
Rym: I had two dark in the skies two mounted charges and a center command.

660
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:36,107
Rym: That was like like I had every good card in my hand right then and there and I just trounced all over Scott And there was nothing he could do.

661
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:38,160
Rym: there was no amount of skill on my part.

662
00:49:38,664 --> 00:49:43,291
Rym: It was just the fact that I not only did I start with that hand But I drew nothing but amazing cards for the whole game.

663
00:49:43,874 --> 00:49:45,320
Rym: I couldn't have cheated to do that.

664
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:56,040
Scott: Well, yeah it's like I like the mechanic of not having to deal with every unit every turn and having some sort of deck of cards that You know you play a card and that's what you do this turn.

665
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,616
Scott: You know the card dictates what you're allowed to do with your units.

666
00:49:58,656 --> 00:49:59,119
Scott: That's cool.

667
00:49:59,665 --> 00:50:08,820
Scott: But if you're gonna do that Then you can't make it to where there are so few cards that you can be stiffed and you know that the odds of being Stiffed are pretty good.

668
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:21,040
Scott: It has to be such that No matter which cards you get by playing the correct ones and using them to their fullest ability You can win and that under almost, you know, almost not a hundred percent because that's not possible.

669
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:28,180
Scott: But almost under no condition will the best player in the world lose to a ten-year-old kid because he drew crap cards.

670
00:50:28,703 --> 00:50:35,697
Rym: Still I think in the end the best way to mitigate the problems I see with this game which are numerous would simply be to add one more tactical element.

671
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,125
Rym: and Granted we haven't talked about lore.

672
00:50:38,486 --> 00:50:43,000
Rym: Lore is basically the super co powers from advanced wars and it's in this game.

673
00:50:43,342 --> 00:50:45,476
Scott: that's really what the difference is in this game.

674
00:50:45,516 --> 00:50:48,863
Scott: because Well as you described the game so far That's the same.

675
00:50:48,923 --> 00:50:52,520
Scott: it's basically the same as memoir 44 and all the other command and colors games.

676
00:50:52,821 --> 00:51:04,660
Scott: What battle lore adds is the goblins and the giant spiders and the lore which is the magic action And it does as Rym said work just like the co powers from advanced wars.

677
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:15,990
Rym: but even that added in does not add any tactical thought of any depth because again, it's obvious what spell to cast and The scenarios at least for now give you your war council.

678
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,000
Rym: So there isn't even the drafting of deciding your war council.

679
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,032
Scott: Well, you do in the later adventures in the adventure book.

680
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:23,860
Scott: You do decide your war council.

681
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:28,829
Scott: They'll give you like X levels and you can Allocate them to your lore council, however you want.

682
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,079
Rym: Yeah, that's the only thing we haven't played with yet.

683
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:36,760
Rym: However, I don't think that that level of drafting is going to have any substantial effect.

684
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:43,460
Scott: Yeah, it does seem like the level of your people in your war council doesn't really matter that much.

685
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:50,039
Scott: It's like, you know for some of them it matters a little bit like the cleric I've heard and for the command it matters a lot.

686
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,471
Scott: but it seems like you're pretty much choosing like.

687
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:55,591
Scott: well, I have a wizard and thus my Any wizard.

688
00:51:55,631 --> 00:51:56,499
Scott: spells be better?

689
00:51:57,542 --> 00:52:05,480
Rym: Go get a rogue and thus any road as the added element of the way they Determine how many of each card are in the deck to be drawn is based on the level.

690
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:05,962
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

691
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:09,340
Scott: so if you know the deck of magic spells then you gay.

692
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,193
Scott: Okay, I really want to have the rogue spells in this game.

693
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,560
Scott: So I'm gonna put levels into rogues.

694
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:18,160
Scott: So there's more rogue cards in the deck, you know, and I guess that's just a matter of knowing the deck.

695
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:21,460
Scott: But I don't think it really would have a big effect on the game.

696
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,733
Scott: It's just choices of your CEO power.

697
00:52:24,095 --> 00:52:28,590
Rym: as the game stands I feel like between two reasonably intelligent people.

698
00:52:28,931 --> 00:52:49,440
Rym: the deciding factor and who wins will more often than not be luck because unless one person makes a mistake or isn't smart enough or just doesn't understand how the game works on a fundamental level or just isn't paying attention to which cards have already been played or Which side an opponent's been favoring or you know all those little things that you just got to pay attention to in a game like this.

699
00:52:50,182 --> 00:52:51,479
Rym: There's not so much to the game.

700
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:59,689
Rym: And I think if they added just one more tactical element and I'm gonna think long and hard and see if I can just write That expansion to make the game the end of game.

701
00:52:59,729 --> 00:53:02,800
Rym: I want the problem is I need a a more dense hex grid.

702
00:53:03,334 --> 00:53:09,831
Scott: Yeah I mean there is the back of the board and they are going to release Another board to go with it and to make a double board.

703
00:53:10,152 --> 00:53:11,940
Scott: and who knows what will come of that in the end.

704
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:19,186
Scott: But it'll definitely come out sometime and if battle lore is still interesting to us May or may not get it depending on the price.

705
00:53:19,747 --> 00:53:24,020
Rym: if you're expecting a hardcore war game give this a pass at least for now.

706
00:53:24,241 --> 00:53:32,360
Scott: Yes, if you like only games where you have to you know Where there's some strategic thinking the smartest guy wins and any other kind of game pisses you off.

707
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:34,003
Scott: Don't buy this game.

708
00:53:34,184 --> 00:53:39,899
Rym: if you've got 10 to 15 year old kids or nephews and they're at all interested in board gaming They'll probably eat this right up.

709
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,455
Scott: Yeah, get this instead of heroscape which is cost a lot more money and is not as good.

710
00:53:44,656 --> 00:53:45,760
Rym: not as good or as fun.

711
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:58,271
Scott: Yeah, but if you just like moving guys around and fighting and you know You're the kind of person who likes to play risk But it takes so long and after the first hour You're no longer having fun and you just want to give up.

712
00:53:58,793 --> 00:54:13,260
Scott: but and you like fantasy settings battle lore might be what you want because you get the same fun you get in the first hour of risk with the about the same level of thinking and After the first hour you're done it the game's over so you don't have to cry about the other three hours of playing risk.

713
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:13,951
Scott: That aren't fun.

714
00:54:14,337 --> 00:54:21,371
Rym: Yep However, the front row crew we were talking about it and most of us agree that we would rather have played Shogun Despite the fact that it takes three hours.

715
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:30,615
Scott: Yeah, the thing is like the in Shogun for me like I like it a lot But it's only fun for me in the first hour and then it's really painful.

716
00:54:30,876 --> 00:54:32,040
Rym: That's like is by the.

717
00:54:32,925 --> 00:54:33,940
Scott: It's like a bigger graph.

718
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:39,120
Scott: It's like the beginning hour of Shogun is way fun and then it goes way down to be incredibly painful.

719
00:54:39,523 --> 00:54:48,520
Rym: I think part of that is because by the second and a half hour You've got one army holed up in your fortress on Kyushu hiding from about the massive Ronin armies of me and Pete.

720
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:49,483
Scott: It could be.

721
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:52,212
Scott: I mean, I've done okay at Shogun in the past.

722
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:53,737
Rym: You have we all have Shogun's.

723
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,306
Rym: a great game Yeah, but it's still.

724
00:54:56,367 --> 00:54:57,993
Scott: it's like battle or is just isn't?

725
00:54:58,234 --> 00:54:59,860
Scott: you know, it's fun for an hour.

726
00:55:00,061 --> 00:55:03,884
Scott: if you like that sort of thing, you may or may not and Then it's over.

727
00:55:04,185 --> 00:55:15,536
Rym: Yeah, I'll say that I haven't enjoyed it really at all yet but I keep playing it because I want to make sure I'm not missing something and I want to figure the game out enough to know exactly What point it is?

728
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,252
Rym: Where I go from having fun to not having fun and make an expansion that fixes it.

729
00:55:19,272 --> 00:55:28,120
Scott: because I'm not gonna shit talk because at The very least if you buy battle or this game comes with a lot of stuff There's a lot of stuff in there and it's really easy to change.

730
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:38,025
Scott: I mean they give you access to this adventure editor online and they pick like people's adventures to be like super like Official adventures and stuff.

731
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:43,560
Scott: So if you're really like customizing games, but you don't want to collect games.

732
00:55:44,222 --> 00:55:45,628
Scott: There's also that aspect to it.

733
00:55:45,648 --> 00:55:46,271
Scott: That's pretty fun.

734
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:48,439
Scott: All right, so that's battle or yep.

735
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,142
Rym: So I guess.

736
00:55:49,182 --> 00:55:57,060
Rym: last and certainly not least just because we haven't mentioned it any day other than Wednesday I think but since we're doing the video game room, it's probably relevant.

737
00:55:57,502 --> 00:55:57,582
Scott: Ah,

738
00:55:57,823 --> 00:56:01,180

00:56:01,661 --> 00:56:08,060
Scott: If you live anywhere near Washington DC or you can get to Washington DC with you know effort

740
00:56:08,443 --> 00:56:23,680

Scott: I can't promise that though.

743
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:40,360
Rym: Yeah, we may have the first tiny bit of swag or swag depending on whether generous We're feeling ready by Katsucon and if nothing else we'll be running some tournaments that may or may not have some prizes.

744
00:56:40,802 --> 00:56:45,986
