1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,997
Scott: It's Wednesday November 7th.

2
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:12,020
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:15,090
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:17,529
Scott: Why Naruto sucks?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,397
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:42,400
Scott: So I came home the other day to box a really heavy big box, and it said to Scott Yeah, well there's a lot of boxes coming from the mail these days so sadly none of them contain brides.

7
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:43,912
Scott: I wish there were some brides in there.

8
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:48,938
Scott: That'd be nice, but no Not Yoko Kanno, I guess she would count as a bride.

9
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:54,006
Scott: no Anyway, you know I had a.

10
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,109
Rym: this is no joke.

11
00:00:55,531 --> 00:01:01,873
Rym: I had a teacher in high school whose father Did in fact get a Russian mail-order bride.

12
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:05,424
Scott: I remember back in that when I was in Rochester There was on the local radio.

13
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:10,780
Scott: a guy called in and talked about how he would go to Russia to be with brides.

14
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:16,637
Rym: No this was that she came over and lived with him as his wife yeah, and she learned English.

15
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:17,700
Scott: it is a real thing.

16
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:19,819
Scott: It's kind of creepy, but it's real.

17
00:01:20,404 --> 00:01:28,598
Rym: It was an interesting situation And he would periodically give us updates about how his stepmother the Russian mail-order bride was doing.

18
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:40,620
Scott: yeah Anyway, yeah, so in this box I don't know if everyone listening knows But I get a like the way I buy comics as I ordered them from this website DCB service calm direct comic book service.

19
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:47,333
Scott: And the way it works is you order comic books two months in advance Which is kind of sucks because you don't get to look before you buy.

20
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:52,835
Scott: and sometimes I buy crap But it's worth it because I get like 40% off.

21
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:56,872
Scott: so even if I buy crap I still save a shit ton of money, and I get like.

22
00:01:56,932 --> 00:02:03,140
Scott: I spend like a hundred bucks in comics every month But I get like two hundred and fifty dollars worth of comics, and it's just like this big mountain.

23
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:12,360
Rym: It's great because whenever I want a comic I if I find out when it's coming out I just tell Scott hey put it in your thing, and then it comes for almost no money almost no money.

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,025
Scott: I mean manga.

25
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,101
Scott: even an expensive manga will be like eight bucks Amy.

26
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:29,278
Scott: and sometimes every month is like specials some like last volume of Death Note five dollars Five dollars brand new not used or anything anyway, so two of these comics of the I don't know 20 or so.

27
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:40,296
Scott: Usually what happens is it sort of comes in waves so I could be light month with a little tiny box a little tiny Box little tiny box big box, and it was finally the big box this time, but I got the the trial of Colonel sweeto.

28
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:50,459
Rym: Oh My god, which if you don't know what that is I suggest you search for the Perry Bible fellowship Which is nothing as nothing to do with Perry's Bibles or fellowships.

29
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,393
Scott: I think it has something to do with Perry's does it now?

30
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:54,740
Scott: it does indeed well.

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,680
Rym: Regardless it is in my opinion one of the funniest things ever put to ink or any other medium.

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,500
Scott: I would put it in the top 10 comic strips of all time in the history of the world.

33
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:06,982
Rym: It's just.

34
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:10,980
Rym: it's so wonderful and the book doesn't actually have a lot of specials in it.

35
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,898
Rym: It has like 10 lost strips even though I've seen some of those so I'm not sure how lost they really were.

36
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:18,283
Rym: but yeah Not.

37
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:22,940
Rym: I expected commentary on all of them, and I was really sad to only get commentary on the lost strips.

38
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,660
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't matter because it's still worth it to have those things a little book.

39
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:29,080
Scott: Oh, yeah website is sort of annoying to navigate.

40
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:32,619
Rym: I just I love it, but the other thing I got that was really important.

41
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,423
Rym: here We've talked a bit about.

42
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:39,539
Rym: Jason are one of our favorite comic artists, and he did such things as why are you doing this?

43
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:39,619
Rym: and?

44
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,504
Scott: The Left Bank game?

45
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:42,950
Rym: yeah, that was the good one.

46
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:51,880
Rym: Yeah, it was all Hemingway, but it was also Anyway, they all have a very distinctive style, and we've talked about that, but I want to do a quick geek bite here.

47
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:56,300
Scott: I remember back in the day when I first found out about what are you doing this from like some blog?

48
00:03:56,421 --> 00:04:00,003
Scott: I think was boiling boiling and I was like and I read the description of it I'm like oh, man.

49
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:01,008
Scott: That's a comic for him.

50
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,173
Scott: It was like years ago.

51
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:02,655
Rym: Think about it.

52
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:02,796
Rym: You're

53
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:04,466
Scott: an RIT still Maybe it's

54
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:07,763
Rym: a short simple psychological thriller

55
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:16,420
Scott: and it had like animal people and I was like I soon as I read the description I knew it was the Comic for Rym, and it took me how many years to actually get a copy of it, and then what I did.

56
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,384
Scott: I was so right.

57
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:19,834
Rym: so uh we just got finally.

58
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:21,279
Rym: I think it's one of his newest works.

59
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,043
Scott: It's the newest one.

60
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:33,347
Rym: yeah is the title is I killed Adolf Hitler I killed Adolf Hitler and It's about Exactly, what do you think it's about?

61
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,110
Scott: It's like you think.

62
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,416
Scott: oh, you know it's one of you know.

63
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:41,016
Scott: usually when people make something About Hitler like he appears once or you know it doesn't actually have to do with Hitler literally.

64
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:49,461
Scott: no literally I killed it off Hitler literally, and I'm not gonna ruin it cuz Crime.

65
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:56,915
Rym: but one you should read everything this man ever writes, but two I Just remembered what happened to Hitler.

Rym: I killed Adolf Hitler.

69
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,731

71
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:07,920
Rym: all I know is that they there.

72
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:12,554
Rym: The trend in these works tends to be along the lines of concept.

73
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:13,337
Rym: Oh, okay.

74
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:21,040
Rym: Oh oh Oh And then it ends yep, and this one is true to farm.

75
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:27,520

76
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,666
Scott: I'm trying to talk nothing else.

77
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:33,007

Scott: It is published by Fanta graphics.

81
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:44,570

00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:45,696
Rym: and it's just.

Rym: I think I'm going to eventually own the entire Jason collection.

96
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,116
Scott: Yeah, I think we've got like three or four of them already.

97
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:26,420

Scott: I'm ready all right, so there was a survey company called Oricon right which is a big Japanese survey company.

100
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:52,982
Scott: I always see their name attached to all sorts of surveys about anime and stuff and they did a they survey for Japan's culture day on November 3rd and They had a questionnaire at and the questionnaire asked which cultural figure represents Japan?

101
00:06:53,323 --> 00:07:11,543
Scott: right like they asked Japanese people which cultural figure you know represents your country and They had two thousand two thousand people online and they evenly divided them between all the different age groups five different age groups You know of both genders and the results were Number two.

102
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:18,120
Scott: the number two person who represents Japan was Miyazaki all right, but that's expected and acceptable.

103
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:21,142
Scott: You know the number one Person was.

104
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:28,711
Scott: I could say something funny, but it's a Japanese person you know, but I doubt you'll guess it, but just try Satoshi Ka.

105
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:33,320
Scott: I know It was a Takeshi Kitano.

106
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:35,840
Scott: Really, yes, really, huh?

107
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,292
Scott: He's the number one person of representing Japan.

108
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:41,704

Scott: he's the bad guy in battle royale.

111
00:07:44,337 --> 00:07:51,600
Scott: He's also Count Takeshi from Takeshi's castle and Takeshi's challenge the horrible Nintendo game.

112
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,860
Scott: And he's also an amazing actor for many movies that you probably should see because they're all awesome.

113
00:07:58,262 --> 00:08:02,200
Scott: I think he was Zato Ichi in a recent in the recent Zato Ichi movie.

114
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:10,308
Rym: He's almost as cool as Koyasu almost as cool as Takehito Koyasu, but not quite Aka pumpkin head.

115
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:22,851
Scott: no, but you should Seek out Takeshi Kitano also known as beat Takeshi and see him in all his Artistic endeavors usually TV shows and movies right.

116
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:35,693
Rym: so this is slightly old news But it's kind of interesting, and I'm very happy about this, but according to anime news network There's a new anime distributor translator, or whatever.

117
00:08:36,193 --> 00:08:43,313
Rym: just so we need another anime called Reanimedia and they're going to be releasing the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

118
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:46,282
Scott: wait someone already has that here the place promised our early Days.

00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,340
Rym: We have that also serial experiments lane.

121
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,889
Scott: Those are all different companies that put that out here in Russia.

122
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:55,855
Rym: Oh and the Baltic states.

123
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:56,456
Scott: Yeah.

124
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:57,639
Scott: Oh, that's fine.

125
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:00,187
Scott: Are Russians into anime?

126
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:01,933
Rym: uh you know what I would imagine.

127
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:06,910
Rym: so because it seems like Most of the world is into anime in some form.

128
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:13,894
Scott: no Italy is super into anime like Italy loves going to gain To Italy and actually from what I hear Mexico Mexico.

129
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:15,199
Scott: I can ball south them all.

130
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:20,356
Rym: America loves loves frickin and Dragon Ball and G Gundam and anything like that.

131
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:21,360
Rym: apparently Latin America.

132
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,906
Scott: Just they love that shit.

133
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:24,712
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, Russia.

134
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,960
Scott: Huh, I guess maybe the you know Russians.

135
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,449
Scott: They know how to use computers pretty well.

136
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,999
Scott: Maybe they torrents got over there.

137
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:33,156
Rym: Yeah, well apparently they also bought out a company called Excel.

138
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:34,623
Rym: oh alright I was a little mistaken.

139
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:38,800
Rym: half of those titles were being brought out by Excel media, which they just bought.

140
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:43,020
Rym: But in addition they're bringing out pet shop of whores and Suzumiya, huh?

141
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,366
Scott: Maybe there's a way to make some money.

142
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:47,039
Scott: go to countries that don't have anime and bring it there.

143
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,814
Scott: You know just like buy licenses and then go am I or like.

144
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,140
Scott: what about companies like you know?

145
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,003
Scott: At V is like.

146
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:54,490
Scott: you know they pay all this money for rights.

147
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,720
Scott: why they only buy the u.s.. Rights probably?

148
00:09:56,921 --> 00:10:00,254
Scott: Why don't you try to buy like some worldwide rights, and then you know go big.

149
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:01,640
Rym: see it's hard to say.

150
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:06,820
Rym: I wonder what the Japanese even say to someone offering to buy a worldwide right or not exclusive.

151
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,630
Scott: That's really why the Japanese get the world right.

152
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,957
Scott: they already own the world right rice.

153
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:10,480
Scott: They made it.

154
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,009
Scott: Why don't they go worldwide?

155
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:12,411
Scott: I don't know I?

156
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Rym: Take issue with a lot of the way Japan tries to my.

157
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,465
Scott: Take the world.

158
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,939
Scott: I also take issue, but you would think that would be the way to get the most profits.

159
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,535
Scott: no You know I don't know.

160
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:28,525
Scott: maybe a less Potential profit, but lower risk.

161
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:33,640
Rym: or maybe they've realized that the American anime companies will just bend over and take it regardless.

162
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:34,911
Rym: So why bother changing?

163
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:36,000
Scott: yeah again?

164
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:40,555
Scott: I wonder are they really making the most from the American ones and compared to any other country?

165
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:44,186
Rym: see the problem is None of them ever say anything.

166
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:45,910
Scott: we have no idea what anime.

167
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:51,151
Scott: so we know like the UK anime companies could be you know Doing a lot better than the American ones.

168
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:52,661
Scott: who knows I mean There's.

169
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:58,820
Rym: so we've complained about this a lot and so is that in my world order the anime industry is so tight-lipped in the u.s.

170
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,079
Rym: That it's it's ludicrous like it bothers me.

171
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:08,220
Scott: Yeah, don't they see that like in every other industry the companies that are you know the more well?

172
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,659
Scott: I don't know.

173
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:14,810
Scott: I guess that's sort of incorrect to say that because you look at places like Apple and Google It's like the the tight lips and it seems to work out.

174
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:19,540
Scott: But I guess well people tend to like companies that lose their lips.

175
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:44,757
Rym: Well at the same time I feel like they could put a lot more pressure on the Japanese companies if even if they weren't more open if they I don't know colluded illegally Or in some way if any of them would just stand up and say no That much money is ludicrous for a show that you're not even gonna Let me release for a year and a half in the u.s.. And won't let me talk about until two weeks before whatever.

176
00:11:44,978 --> 00:11:53,985
Scott: yep Well people just you know they they don't make the day of the hardcore like business deal where businessmen duke it out and and drive A hard bargain.

177
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,820
Scott: I think that day is sort of long gone.

178
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:56,586
Rym: I don't think it is.

179
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:58,420
Rym: I just think the anime companies in the u.s.

180
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,800
Rym: Are run mostly by anime fans as opposed to by businessman with testicles.

181
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:11,358
Rym: So things of the day.

182
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,088
Rym: I'm not sure what I can say about this.

183
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,689
Scott: Mickey fail.

184
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:24,946
Rym: What it is a blog not in English Dedicated to pictures of Mickey Mouse that portray him in an unflattering way.

185
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:26,110
Scott: Oh Mickey fail.

186
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,557
Rym: Feo fe I.

187
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:31,847
Scott: oh oh that's not Spanish, but that is a Latin language of some sort.

188
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:32,890
Scott: because fail in Spanish.

189
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:39,584
Rym: Oh, I never would have guessed yeah But I look ugly Mickey Mouse ugly Mickey Mouse bunch of ugly Mickey mice.

190
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,852
Scott: you like ugly Mickey Mouse I don't know.

191
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:47,210
Rym: I just I guess this speaks of the fact that one there's a blog for everything.

192
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:58,900
Rym: That's true everything - I don't know that there's some amount of novelty to looking at a website that is so Specialized and to such a specific audience.

193
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:03,513
Scott: I don't think it's more specialized than nadshots.com I don't know.

194
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,175
Rym: it might be.

195
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:04,918
Scott: no it's not.

196
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:05,439
Rym: it might be.

197
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:07,164
Rym: that is in all comics.

198
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,990
Rym: This is just Mickey Mouse.

199
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:13,775
Rym: Maybe maybe but anyway Looks like a penis.

200
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,059
Scott: I want to take this opportunity.

201
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:15,461
Scott: So does this?

202
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:19,894
Rym: I think that Mickey Mouse is constructed entirely of Stylized palaces.

203
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:24,429
Scott: I want to take this opportunity to say that I actually really like Mickey Mouse and that.

204
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:31,669
Scott: One thing that constantly pisses me off is that Disney doesn't let anyone make any Mickey Mouse cartoons with their endless copyright.

205
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:35,310
Rym: BS Huh, but it wasn't that wasn't that copyright just about to expire?

206
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:38,110
Rym: Bono copyright saved the day.

207
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:43,627
Scott: But at the same time what have they done with Mickey Mouse besides merchandise since the prince of the pauper?

208
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:44,389
Scott: well nothing.

209
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:47,910
Rym: Let him fade as fast as they can into obscurity.

210
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:52,362
Scott: Yeah I mean more people around the world recognize Mario than recognize Mickey Mouse at this point.

211
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:55,775
Scott: make Mickey Mouse cartoons make a whole Full.

212
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,718
Scott: you know, you make a full-length Animation motion picture every summer.

213
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,470
Scott: Why don't you put Mickey Mouse in one of those freaking movies?

214
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:11,103
Rym: See is I'd be all for that except there's someone who needs a movie theater to see that shit much more desperately and that's Donald Duck, but you got a course.

215
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:11,970
Scott: put all of them in there.

216
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:18,030
Scott: But you know Mickey Mouse would be the main guy and you call it, you know I mean the other day I was randomly watching some of those old like goofy cartoons.

217
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,917
Rym: Like goofy teaches you how to ski.

218
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:26,050
Scott: Yeah, or ah, I know you are the biggest fan of the goofy and the Donald Duck.

219
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,179
Rym: More so but well more than anything.

220
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,690
Rym: It's anytime Donald Duck and Chip and Dale get into it.

221
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,990
Scott: Yeah for me it's all about like the Mickey and the Beanstalk sock action.

222
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:38,989
Scott: but of course Mickey and the Beanstalk is so great, but that part with goofy on the jello.

223
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:46,369
Scott: You bring this up every time we talk about Jello, if you haven't seen Mickey and the Beanstalk, you're not human being.

224
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:50,438
Scott: And also, I mean, come on Fantasia best part Mickey Mouse.

225
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,102
Scott: Oh, I don't know.

226
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:56,274
Scott: say I guess that's second to the the finale Not a bomb out.

227
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,881
Scott: All right, do I need to do a thing today?

228
00:14:58,162 --> 00:14:58,845
Rym: I think you do.

229
00:14:58,945 --> 00:14:59,990
Scott: Okay, Mickey Mouse is awesome.

230
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:04,162
Scott: Anime News Network, you provide me all my news on Wednesday.

231
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:05,366
Scott: You are so wonderful.

232
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:07,996
Rym: Yeah, great I go to this one website.

233
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:09,963
Rym: pick the least not interesting thing.

234
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:11,930
Scott: read it kind of my news and my thing.

235
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,417
Scott: They are both from anime news network.

236
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,210
Scott: I would just like to extend my thanks to anime news network.

237
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,089
Rym: So you're not doing the rocky thing?

238
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,385
Scott: No, that was kind of funny, but it's not.

239
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:20,849
Rym: it was good.

240
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:25,512
Rym: It's funny cuz Scott always yells at me and Emily and everyone whenever it's like Like.

241
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:27,380
Rym: I see something on the internet and he saw it.

242
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:27,802
Rym: I don't know.

243
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,027
Rym: five seconds ago man written.

00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:34,490
Rym: This is like so awesome.

247
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:35,878
Rym: Oh my god, you have to come and watch it.

248
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:41,197
Rym: We walk over and both of us simultaneously Say that's so old.

249
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:42,843
Rym: I saw that like a year ago.

250
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:47,083
Scott: Yeah, the difference is when I you know Different I don't care.

251
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:49,654
Scott: You say it's so old.

252
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:50,317
Scott: I'm like whatever.

253
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:51,160
Scott: I just found it.

254
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,496
Rym: However, if you've never seen it, you know yesterday I did Half-life in 60 seconds.

255
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:56,937
Rym: Yep.

256
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:58,001
Rym: This is rocky.

257
00:15:58,102 --> 00:16:00,330
Rym: One, two, three, four, five and six in five seconds.

258
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:02,050
Scott: Yeah, all right.

259
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:21,030
Scott: so my actual thing today from anime news network is anime news network like many other blogs and cool websites that provide geek news had a pumpkin carving contest and these are all the pictures of the pumpkin carving contest and Many of them, you know, some are better than others But you know anime themed pumpkins some of them amazing in quality.

260
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:26,330
Rym: Scott tried to show me a picture of his favorite pumpkin, but every time I tried to look at it He turned the laptop away.

261
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:27,295
Scott: What?

262
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:27,719
Scott: no, I didn't.

263
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,058
Rym: ah You could have run with that.

264
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:35,399
Rym: cuz if think about what your eyes Ruined the joke, maybe why do you do this to me?

265
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:38,550
Scott: But anyway, yes, this is some really good pumpkins going on here.

266
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,359
Scott: I mean, I see this really good gonkotsu.

267
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,585
Scott: Oh one this housing one.

268
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:42,630
Scott: That's just like amazing.

269
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,190
Scott: Here is one where they actually made the pumpkin into a Haro.

270
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:49,723
Scott: It's good stuff going on here, but Scott.

271
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:50,909
Rym: What is the best one?

272
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:59,205
Scott: Well, it's not actually the best one because the actual Quality of it is is pretty low, but the boo pumpkin is amazing.

273
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:00,690
Scott: I like booze.

274
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:11,709
Scott: I mean you could they could have just taken a picture of a boo printed out of their printer and taped it to the front of the pumpkin And then on the backside of the pumpkin taped a picture of the boo with his eyes closed And that would have been good enough for me.

275
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:15,707
Rym: You hear that fangirls draw a boo and Scott will be all over that.

276
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:25,790
Rym: maybe It's actually kind of sad because for the last two years we have said all right We're gonna carve pumpkins here in the game more like for flash ten years.

277
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,070
Rym: Well here I mean known you pretend you count our IT where every year we wanted to carve pumpkins.

278
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,463
Rym: But either I didn't have enough money to buy a pumpkin this year.

279
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:35,687
Scott: We even failed at buying them.

280
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:38,941
Rym: We didn't get one I don't know what's because last year we went and bought pumpkins.

281
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:41,030
Rym: We're like, oh man, we got three pumpkins.

282
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:43,170
Rym: We're all gonna carve pumpkins gonna be awesome.

283
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:47,244
Rym: And then we even got Emily to come out and like let's carve our pumpkins the three of us.

284
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:50,295
Scott: and then we didn't even Bought the tools to carve them.

285
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:51,720
Rym: So we've still got the tools.

286
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,264
Rym: I've got like a hundred tea candles, but The pumpkin sat there until the others tea lights.

287
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:58,390
Rym: It's a candle.

288
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,981
Scott: It is a candle but it's a specific type of candle.

289
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:03,130
Rym: Yes a tea one a tea light candle.

290
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:05,467
Scott: No, it's a tea light is a subset of candle.

291
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:09,442
Rym: So thus it is also a tea candle.

292
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:18,770
Rym: no Anyway So this year we went apple picking earlier than we expected.

293
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:22,325
Rym: So as a result, it was too early to buy pumpkins the pumpkins ahead.

294
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:23,490
Rym: We're not so great dad.

295
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,824
Scott: Well, I think it was mostly their lack of pumpkin selection.

296
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:26,789
Rym: It was too soon.

297
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:29,278
Scott: It was too soon also, but the selection was also.

298
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:30,402
Rym: so we said don't worry.

299
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:32,810
Rym: We'll come back and buy pumpkins when it's time.

300
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:35,215
Rym: And Halloween came and went.

301
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:38,366
Rym: yep, and we've still got the hundred tea candles.

302
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:42,258
Scott: It's reminds me of an idea Open pumpkin carving tool.

303
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,843
Scott: this reminds me of an idea I had today.

304
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:44,185
Scott: You ready?

305
00:18:44,686 --> 00:18:49,220
Scott: I had this idea, you know Thanksgivings coming up right actually had this idea listening to Dave and Joel.

306
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,330
Scott: Thank you, Dave and Joel, you know a cornucopia, right?

307
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,378
Scott: You know what a cornucopia is?

308
00:18:53,479 --> 00:19:02,130
Scott: Yes, it's something that I People more often today use the word to say like oh a cornucopia of something as in a bounty, right?

309
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,418
Scott: But the actual object a cornucopia.

310
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:05,240
Scott: you've seen them.

311
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:07,910
Scott: You probably might not know but it's it's a Thanksgiving kind of thing.

312
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,229
Scott: It's like a it's like a horn basket thing with a whole bunch of crap coming out of it.

313
00:19:18,434 --> 00:19:20,065
Rym: I don't know, but I pictured something horrible.

314
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:26,109
Rym: No, I Want people to make geek cornucopias and send them to us?

315
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,015
Scott: Well, no, you can just take a picture and put it online but we're like geek cornucopias.

316
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:37,819
Scott: right and try to make a theme like you can make like a an anime cornucopia or maybe a Halo cornucopia or full of grenades.

317
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,634
Scott: Yeah a half-life cornucopia grenades Mario Cornucopia little bombs.

318
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:44,519
Scott: Who knows, you know something like that.

319
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,910
Scott: go for it and you know, it could even just be photoshops.

320
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,054
Scott: It could be the real deal.

321
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:52,084
Scott: I want to see people get creative here with the cornucopias.

322
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:53,830
Scott: That is that is my request.

323
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:55,217
Rym: Oh, yeah, one more thing.

324
00:19:55,257 --> 00:20:00,057
Rym: I'll just bring this up on the show because I'm proud I finally did it and I actually updated it.

325
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:01,522
Rym: I have a blog.

326
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:02,485
Scott: Oh, man.

327
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:03,107
Scott: Oh, man.

328
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:05,755
Scott: I've had a blog for Since 2003 or 4 well years.

329
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:12,295
Scott: Technically I've had one since 1998 Here's in years ago.

330
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:16,030
Rym: There was even Scott saw proto GeekNights where he did an audio blog.

331
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:23,302
Scott: Yeah, I just I was bored one day at RIT and I said hey Why don't people like record themselves talking and then put it on their websites.

332
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:24,487
Scott: There's no reason that can't be done.

333
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:24,849
Scott: So I did.

334
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,970
Rym: But yeah, I had a slash journal that I posted in twice and then never even looked at again.

335
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:34,645
Scott: It's like I before.

336
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:38,018
Scott: back in the day I just had to Geo cities which wasn't really a blog technically.

337
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:43,314
Rym: then later my og my Geo cities was a semi illegal Bootleg ROM site.

338
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:58,795
Scott: Yeah, then like I moved that I kept updating that and moving it over and it was just static HTML And then I kept moving it around and doing stuff with it and then I did a slash journal and then I set up some old pearl blogging software and then I set up WordPress and I'm still using that WordPress.

339
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:04,161
Rym: But yeah, it's not Dvorak org slash blog It's Rym dot front row crew.

340
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:05,989
Rym: calm because I know how to use domains.

341
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:11,704
Scott: Actually, I should put me at that front row crew calm to forward with the C name.

342
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:13,410
Rym: Yes, you should there's no reason not to.

343
00:21:13,611 --> 00:21:17,416
Scott: I know I'll probably do that tonight if I remember Yeah, I'll probably eventually.

344
00:21:17,436 --> 00:21:23,096
Rym: the problem is that Rym net is taken by something stupid and Rym calm is way for Way for it to expire.

345
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:24,340
Rym: it expires in forever.

346
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,263
Scott: Oh, yeah.

347
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:25,805
Scott: Oh, well.

348
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:26,848
Scott: All right.

349
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,321
Scott: So tonight We learned from Dave and Joel again.

350
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:32,208
Scott: They recently reviewed gal guy guy.

351
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:34,589
Scott: now I'm not gonna comment on because I've never seen it.

352
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:35,873
Rym: I've seen some.

353
00:21:36,214 --> 00:21:38,942
Rym: gal guy guy is an awesome show as long as you never watch it.

354
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:41,830
Scott: Okay, so I like the song anyway.

355
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:50,970
Scott: So what happened was is they they basically they didn't say they didn't They didn't hate on the show exactly.

356
00:21:51,073 --> 00:22:00,550
Scott: But again They weren't the biggest fans of the show and it seemed that the popular opinion was that the show was bad for a while And then got good really good and was an awesome show.

357
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:06,270
Scott: So this the fact that their opinion was contrary to the popular opinion drew some attention.

358
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:09,140
Scott: So he said hey, I got an idea.

359
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:16,262
Scott: Let's start doing some shows where we give opinions Contrary to the popular opinion and maybe we can get some attention though.

360
00:22:16,282 --> 00:22:23,666
Rym: Don't worry because I think next Tuesday We're gonna do a show that is not contrary to the public opinion, but the two of us disagree.

361
00:22:23,686 --> 00:22:25,816
Rym: Oh Because it's been it's.

362
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:27,949
Rym: I'm not even gonna say what it is, I'll see if you all can guess.

363
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:30,077
Scott: It shouldn't be hard if you've been in the forums.

364
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:33,490
Rym: Yeah, there's only two things that we've been arguing about lately.

365
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,682
Scott: So today we're gonna do something that's gonna piss a bunch of people off.

366
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:45,730
Scott: We're gonna tell you that Naruto sucks So does bleach and so does one piece and so does dragon ball.

367
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:49,305
Rym: There's a special place in my heart for the absolute disdain.

368
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:50,450
Rym: I feel towards cried.

369
00:22:51,391 --> 00:22:52,935
Scott: I've only watched like two episodes of that.

370
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,299
Rym: That's not a good show.

371
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,810
Scott: brave master also sucks final fantasy unlimited.

372
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:00,039
Scott: I'm trying to think of any others.

373
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,875
Scott: I Can't that fist.

374
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:06,230
Scott: the North Star is good, but only an ironic way and otherwise sucks.

375
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:20,130
Rym: Well, yeah guy guy I think the real important thing I think it was Joel's comment that You can't get me to sit through 26 episodes of a good show and you expect me to wait through 20 episodes of a bad show.

376
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,158
Rym: That might get good.

377
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:21,924
Scott: Yeah.

378
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:27,610
Scott: Yeah Basically, it is the opinion of both of us that there there is a genre of anime and manga.

379
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:42,248
Scott: That is the show not just shonen but shonen fighting a subset of shonen even right which is specifically a show where you have Incredibly long fights and it's the show is all about the fighting or some sort of combat.

380
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:47,490
Scott: in some way You could even argue successfully that something like a car no go could be considered shown in fighting.

381
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:49,340
Scott: Instead of fighting.

382
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,717
Scott: they're playing go he car no go Initial D.

383
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:55,350
Rym: Those are all shown in fighting shows as far as I'm concerned.

384
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,535
Scott: Yeah, they're pretty much.

385
00:23:56,575 --> 00:24:04,007
Scott: you know, it's sometimes tough to draw the line between shonen fighting and sports You know because a lot of the sports show is shown in fighting where instead of fights.

386
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:04,550
Scott: They have a sport.

387
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,309
Rym: I was gonna say something.

388
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:12,090
Scott: Not all sports shows though, cuz they're like touch not shown in fighting even though it is a sports show.

389
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:16,615
Rym: I was gonna make some comment about how the difference is that Sports shows are worse.

390
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:17,659
Scott: No some of them.

391
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:19,685
Rym: I have not seen many sports shows.

392
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,989
Scott: I like I really want to watch attack Number one as do I?

393
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:32,010
Rym: Anyway, I think we're gonna be able to see that though I think the fact that I saw an episode of buzzer beater is what just tainted.

394
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,720
Scott: Buzzer beater is not shown in fighting.

395
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:41,634
Rym: It's just bad sports anime Also the fact that the only touch I've ever seen is the movie and if you've ever seen the movie You'll know why I said that right?

396
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:45,363
Scott: Okay, so we don't like shonen fighting shows.

397
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:51,828
Scott: We think that they're largely inept mindless a waste of time and not good.

398
00:24:51,848 --> 00:25:00,530
Rym: and At the same time there are shows that follow the same format that I. that in my opinion don't suck.

399
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:01,909
Scott: Yeah, and that is true.

400
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:12,781
Rym: Like I think I'm gonna initial D. if you discount anything other than the original the first 26 episodes I think the rest of it is utter utter drivel.

401
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:14,809
Scott: No, you said it is.

402
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:17,077
Rym: It's awful.

403
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:17,622
Scott: I like it.

404
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:18,750
Scott: It's terrible.

405
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:21,620
Rym: You can't make fun of anyone who likes Naruto.

406
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:28,887
Scott: if you like initial D my past episode 27 I think what the rule is right is it's sort of like with with MMOs you're allowed one.

407
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:39,050
Scott: It's like you can have everyone, you know If you've never seen a shonen fighting show or read a shonen fighting manga You can do one and then you learn your lesson from that one.

408
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,858
Scott: But that one has a special place in your heart.

409
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:43,209
Rym: And then yeah, I mean, I'm gonna do it again.

410
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:44,599
Scott: Let's see thing with MMOs.

411
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:50,210
Scott: Like I played a mud back in the day I played many muds back in the day, so I don't need to play World of Warcraft now.

412
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,345
Scott: Yep, I've played World of Warcraft now, and it's your first MMO.

413
00:25:53,546 --> 00:25:54,932
Rym: You're excused You know what.

414
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:58,908
Rym: once you learn your better off World of Warcraft is the best freaking memo ever made.

415
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:02,516
Rym: Yeah, it's still Or up like my.

416
00:26:02,576 --> 00:26:05,527
Rym: I've watched all of Sailor Moon my first magical girl show.

417
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:06,310
Rym: I've got one.

418
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,333
Rym: I like Sailor Moon.

419
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:08,477
Rym: You can all fuck off.

420
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:10,122
Scott: Yeah, you should watch fancy.

421
00:26:10,162 --> 00:26:11,546
Scott: Lala instead fancy.

422
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:12,770
Rym: Lala didn't exist.

423
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:14,054
Scott: Oh, that sucks.

424
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,660
Scott: I was in high school.

425
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:18,470
Rym: I bought fan subs from V kill.

426
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,272
Scott: I really want to know what.

427
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:21,096
Scott: so if anyone knows is up with the dinosaurs.

428
00:26:21,136 --> 00:26:22,279
Scott: I'm still waiting to find out.

429
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:26,320
Rym: I Can tell you what happens in the end of Sailor Moon.

430
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,889
Scott: it does involve dinosaurs.

431
00:26:31,414 --> 00:26:32,950
Scott: No, it's not as good as fancy Lala.

432
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:38,405
Scott: So You're allowed one Shonen fighting show and only one.

433
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:42,420
Rym: But also like Gatekeepers follows a very similar format.

434
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,162
Rym: It's a monster.

435
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:45,570
Scott: Gatekeepers is different, and it's a monster of the week.

436
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:49,186
Scott: I think the difference is there's a clear difference between monster of the week.

437
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:53,418
Scott: Which is something like Voltron or Gatekeepers and such.

438
00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:03,172
Scott: but and then Shonen fighting which is where You know the actual fighting in say a monster of the week is there's the monster you know and then it's mostly Attack.

439
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:06,124
Rym: we saved the day with the power of friendship, right?

440
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:08,213
Scott: It's it's sort of an action You know scene.

441
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:14,464
Scott: it's like it's like a show where they have a big plot and then at the end of the episode There's one action scene where they beat the bad guy.

442
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:15,490
Scott: That's a monster of the week.

443
00:27:16,812 --> 00:27:18,519
Rym: That big o one was.

444
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,830
Scott: that big o one was totally monster of the week.

445
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,710
Rym: It was just had other stuff going on and then big o two was Ava done properly, but that's beside the point.

446
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,044
Scott: Yeah, but you look at you know something like Naruto.

447
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:30,450
Scott: Naruto is not monster of the week.

448
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:34,726
Scott: Naruto is monster of the decade of the 13 episodes.

449
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:35,610
Rym: see here.

450
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:39,804
Rym: Let's just tell this forget everything else and just focus on Naruto.

451
00:27:39,864 --> 00:27:47,550
Rym: because I think the reasons Why I was so excited about Naruto and because remember I liked Naruto.

452
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:49,176
Rym: I wanted to see it.

453
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:50,119
Rym: I heard about it.

454
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:50,822
Rym: There was buzz.

455
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:51,705
Rym: I saw the first four episodes.

456
00:27:51,725 --> 00:27:53,090
Scott: I heard about this thing called Naruto.

457
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:54,599
Scott: It was getting pretty popular.

458
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:55,665
Scott: everyone was talking about it.

459
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:56,369
Scott: I hadn't seen it.

460
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:59,990
Scott: I didn't go out of my way to see it, but you know I saw it at anime club.

461
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,114
Scott: I saw four episodes.

462
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:02,218
Scott: I was intrigued.

463
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,686
Scott: I liked the four episodes, then I went home.

464
00:28:04,746 --> 00:28:05,910
Scott: I downloaded a bunch of fan subs.

465
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:11,290
Scott: I watched 13 episodes of Naruto, and I read I think two volumes of the manga, and then I was done.

466
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:11,952
Scott: but

467
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:22,366
Rym: what we'll do here is just we'll take the story of our rise and fall of Naruto fandom as an example of why we dislike almost all shounen fighting shows

468
00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:32,498
Scott: and the same thing you know because Anything we say about Naruto pretty much applies to all the other big shounen fighting shows equally because it's the same story with all of Them at least as far as I'm concerned.

469
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,050
Rym: so we'd heard all the buzz For a while before we saw Naruto because you know running the anime club back at RIT.

470
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,335
Rym: We were gonna show it once.

471
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:44,333
Scott: we got four episodes hanging out with a hundred anime fans every week.

472
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:51,783
Rym: when Naruto is new and popular kind of hard to avoid Naruto and Everyone was of the opinion that it was the best show ever.

473
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:52,124
Rym: there were.

474
00:28:52,545 --> 00:28:58,284
Rym: people were talking about Naruto the way they talked about Fullmetal Alchemist after it started coming out.

475
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:00,190
Scott: Yeah, they actually did Naruto come first.

476
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,643
Scott: It was around the same time, but people were there's the same level of.

477
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:05,189
Rym: it's the best show ever.

478
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:06,033
Rym: yeah People are just.

479
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:07,781
Scott: oh they were talking it up.

480
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:09,630
Scott: They were having conversations about characters.

481
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:17,750
Rym: There were people at RIT who had made those Naruto headbands for themselves before two episodes had been fan-subbed.

482
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,788
Scott: Yep, yeah, they didn't design those into the show for merchandising.

483
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:23,170
Scott: no.

484
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:30,844
Rym: So we finally get four episodes And we show it to the club and of course we stick around and watch it.

485
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:34,267
Rym: cuz that's kind of why I waited so I Could stick around and watch it with a big crowd of people.

486
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,498
Scott: And it was great!

487
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,305
Rym: It was funny.

488
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:46,029
Rym: ninja school Awesome characters a good plot setup that obviously could come into play in a really interesting dramatic way.

489
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:49,130
Rym: later Like everything was set up the character designs were great.

490
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:56,930
Scott: But you know the only thing I could say bad about it after those four episodes was that the plot was a little bit Transparent like yeah, I know what's gonna go down in the long run.

491
00:29:57,111 --> 00:30:02,590
Scott: You know it's like yeah, obviously you know if they would have mixed They could have mixed it up which is the reason to keep watching.

492
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,262
Scott: But that was the only bad thing after four episodes I could say about.

493
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:07,210
Scott: it is obviously what's gonna go down.

494
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:10,010
Rym: I don't think they needed to mix it up in the first four episodes.

495
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:14,326
Rym: No, which is but that was definitely a long-term plot which didn't really matter.

496
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:20,085
Rym: I don't think no I'm not sure and I really don't care, but yeah, I got it.

497
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:20,587
Rym: I dug it.

498
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:21,670
Rym: I thought Naruto was great.

499
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:23,036
Scott: Yeah, I was I was laughing.

500
00:30:23,056 --> 00:30:25,347
Scott: I was you know when he turned into like you know.

501
00:30:25,387 --> 00:30:25,990
Scott: What's it called?

502
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:32,370
Scott: Sexy nojutsu, that's what it's called and of course the guy with the eyepatch best character ever maybe.

503
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:39,789
Rym: But I think when I got my first inkling that something was wrong Was when before I had seen this scene.

504
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:50,167
Rym: So there was a big fight going on and someone who had already seen that episode Basically had a conversation with me along the lines of oh man when you see how he

505
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:50,608
Scott: pulls

506
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:59,845
Rym: off Like getting past this guy and winning like what he does like you'll see something happen And then they'll go back and reveal how he did it.

507
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:16,204
Rym: Oh, man This is the best show ever and I was all psyched because I expected some sort of like crazy Choreography or some sort of like amazing spike Spiegel kind of thing or just something awesome and great and Instead it was nothing.

508
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:25,890
Rym: it was like oh I used the shadow windmill whatever technique which allowed me to Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah whatever the plot needed blah

509
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:33,050
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's one thing right like let's say you're watching two people play chess right and you have a commentator explaining Oh look at what he did there.

510
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,010
Scott: Are you watching say a football game and someone says it's a draw play oh my god.

511
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:57,325
Rym: Or even if you're watching a show that is obviously fake not a real sporting event or a real contest but yet is self-consistent or generally realistic like you're watching a show about a go tournament and Like someone says oh he did the blah move but in the show really did do like it really did it and they show it.

512
00:31:57,647 --> 00:32:07,787
Rym: or there's a Fencing fight and they actually choreographed his fight, and maybe there's commentary or it does something cool But it happens in the context of the show in a realistic self-consistent manner.

513
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:28,475
Rym: mm-hmm Naruto has the sin that many anime and many other things fall for where instead of actually Showing something cool or coming up with something clever They make up something within like the fake Constraints of whatever's going on and then act as though the thing that they just made up was somehow Amazing.

514
00:32:28,717 --> 00:32:29,606
Scott: yeah, they just it's.

515
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:37,950
Scott: basically I Watched 13 episodes and at the end of that 13th episode you know they were fighting this guy with a big sword and this person with like some mirrors.

516
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:41,949
Scott: and it was like all the you know Naruto and his friends versus these two people.

517
00:32:41,969 --> 00:32:45,379
Scott: and That fight ended in like the 13th or 14th episode or whatever.

518
00:32:45,439 --> 00:33:00,384
Scott: and then I realized that fight started in like the 6th or 7th Episode or something like that and I was like wow and all I could remember from all that stretch of episodes Most of the scenes were Naruto's standing there pan across Naruto's face while you hear his inner monologue of.

519
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,467
Scott: should I use this technique?

520
00:33:01,488 --> 00:33:02,210
Scott: should I use this technique?

521
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,376
Scott: Oh, maybe we'll use this technique.

522
00:33:03,497 --> 00:33:04,362
Scott: Oh wonder what their weaknesses?

523
00:33:04,402 --> 00:33:10,428
Scott: dah dah dah dah dah and Then pan across the picture of the bad guy with all the mirrors and the bad guys going.

524
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:12,588
Scott: haha You cannot get through my mirrors, haha.

525
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:16,679
Rym: Now consider the difference between these two kinds of writing.

526
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,484
Rym: consider say I don't know.

527
00:33:18,544 --> 00:33:20,590
Rym: CS foresters ratio hornblower books.

528
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:27,330
Rym: Now there's a scene where the captain is Like something's going on and he has to make a decision.

529
00:33:27,611 --> 00:33:32,350
Rym: Do I run against the Turkish gun batteries and try to escape through the channel or do I?

530
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,295
Rym: Beat back and Lee again.

531
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:45,057
Rym: So, you know, whatever his options are but the options are realistic either within the context of the fantasy or within the context of the fiction that is based in the real world.

532
00:33:45,418 --> 00:33:50,838
Rym: like the author obviously did a little bit of research and came up with Invitable options and an interesting conflict.

533
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:54,730
Rym: in a show like Naruto you make up a conflict.

534
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,977
Rym: It doesn't matter what the conflict actually is.

535
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:59,867
Rym: It's pretty much literally do I foo or do I bar?

536
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:17,770
Rym: because whenever they need a conflict they just make something up like oh, well your blah blah blah technique didn't work because I Have the blah blah blah blah Yeah, and like the actual stuff that's happening doesn't matter because in the end it's entirely made up.

537
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,737
Scott: They can do whatever they want.

538
00:34:18,797 --> 00:34:20,469
Scott: I mean, how many times do you see in these shows?

539
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:21,371
Scott: Uh-huh.

540
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:23,943
Scott: You have used every technique, you know, and I'm still not defeated.

541
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:24,565
Scott: Huh?

542
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:25,208
Scott: What are you going to do?

543
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:31,920
Scott: And then it's like I will use the super Superpower and they charge up times a hundred something never done before.

544
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,382
Scott: then they win.

545
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:33,928
Scott: his power level is over nine thousand.

546
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,590
Scott: nine thousand the only thing You know.

547
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:41,385
Scott: if the only thing that that is that you're not sure of is who is gonna win.

548
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:45,101
Scott: everything else between Who is fighting and who is going to win?

549
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:48,601
Scott: The fight is just meaningless and a waste of time.

550
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:51,940
Scott: and it's not even like Interesting like how I bebop right.

551
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,897
Scott: watch the first episode of cowboy bebop Even if you've seen it already.

552
00:34:54,937 --> 00:34:55,501
Scott: watch the end.

553
00:34:55,742 --> 00:34:56,949
Scott: There's a fight scene, right?

554
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,375
Rym: It's got a sombrero.

555
00:34:58,395 --> 00:34:59,781
Rym: He kicks the table over that one.

556
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:01,550
Scott: Yeah, that one it's a fight scene.

557
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,901
Scott: There's nothing wrong with a fight scene.

558
00:35:02,922 --> 00:35:03,789
Scott: I'm a fan of action.

559
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:04,573
Scott: Rym is a fan.

560
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:07,365
Scott: it watch something like Iron Monkey also a real kung fu move.

561
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,177
Scott: Oh, man, Iron Monkey You see many fight scenes.

562
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:12,850
Scott: many in fact over half the movie is fight scenes.

563
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:25,810
Scott: Movie is just a vehicle for fight scenes but the fight scenes in and of themselves are a sort of work of art of Choreography or animation and is actually something interesting and stimulating to be seen there.

564
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:29,447
Scott: It's not just a guy standing there another guy standing there and someone.

565
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:31,514
Scott: now I mean Street playing.

566
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:34,584
Scott: Street Fighter is more dynamic than watching Naruto.

567
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:38,858
Rym: these shows Naruto fighting games though It's almost like I'm not watching a show.

568
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:41,830
Rym: I'm watching a series of well animated storyboards.

569
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:42,594
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

570
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:44,504
Scott: it's like someone is narrating.

571
00:35:44,524 --> 00:35:45,570
Scott: there are not even there.

572
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:52,030
Scott: It's like these characters are self narrating some really slow boring made-up sporting event with no rules.

573
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:52,632
Scott: It's completely.

574
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:56,264
Rym: you know what it reminds me of I don't know maybe underwear perverts.

575
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:58,070
Rym: I'll punch you you a little guy.

576
00:35:58,432 --> 00:36:01,930
Rym: Oh, no, I have been punched and in the panel it says he is punching.

577
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:13,518
Rym: No, I did back in the day nowadays a little different But yeah, or even just the idea of how many superhero comics would just whenever they needed a plot device They just made something up that kryptonite.

578
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:16,189
Rym: It's just like oh, well that didn't work because of.

579
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:19,745
Scott: Yeah, it's like oh you punched me.

580
00:36:19,765 --> 00:36:23,742
Scott: I am dead uh-huh no I'm not actually dead because I was wearing the double armor.

581
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:24,666
Scott: uh-huh now.

582
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:25,590
Scott: I hit you with this weapon.

583
00:36:26,113 --> 00:36:28,992
Scott: Oh, I am trapped ah but I get out with my eye lasers It's just.

584
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:43,849
Scott: it's basically like they just invent inventories of things And then they sort of use every item from each inventory And then make up new items in the inventories and just pull them out one at a time until they're done Just to drag things out.

585
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:48,800
Scott: And it's really not Interesting or entertaining once you've seen it before like

586
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:57,801
Rym: that scene that I talked about where I expected something awesome And then it was just oh I use the blah technique in the shadow of the ninja star or whatever he did I don't even remember now.

587
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:12,381
Rym: It was just the fact that in a in a well-written show or a good show There would be some amount of foreshadowing or something you there'd be a Possibility drama that you could foresee ours going to happen.

588
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:13,805
Rym: or at least take a guess.

589
00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:17,421
Rym: and when I saw it And then I found out I'm gonna find out how we did it.

590
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:20,840
Rym: I thought huh well Maybe he did this or maybe he did this.

591
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:22,410
Rym: I'm trying to figure out what he did.

592
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:26,090
Rym: And then I find out that the writer basically said yeah, I don't fucking know what he did either.

593
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:26,954
Rym: I just made up a word.

594
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:27,557
Scott: yep.

595
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:29,869
Scott: I do use the something technique that I just made up.

596
00:37:30,452 --> 00:37:33,363
Rym: Okay, and then this is what really bothered me.

597
00:37:33,403 --> 00:37:56,430
Rym: Naruto of the show would often I don't know if it does this in later episodes, but I can guess Will not only make up some sort of technique or something, but then they'll go into excruciating and completely unnecessary Detail about exactly how the technique worked and why it worked and how it worked on this guy cuz he was weak against this But it wouldn't worked against this guy because his father was the fifth.

598
00:37:57,792 --> 00:38:00,155
Scott: I Really, just don't care.

599
00:38:00,175 --> 00:38:04,090
Scott: That's it the thing that's really disappointing about these shown in fighting shows.

600
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,086
Scott: I mean it wouldn't be so bad if it was just a bad show right across.

601
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:11,057
Rym: like you cried It's great at nothing because there I just started dumb kept being dumb.

602
00:38:11,077 --> 00:38:14,890
Scott: there are plenty of shows that are just dumb across the board and we ignore them.

603
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,664
Scott: We don't complain about them so much, but you look at something Naruto or one piece right.

604
00:38:18,684 --> 00:38:25,510
Scott: and what's so upsetting here Is that they had these amazing characters this amazing plot this amazing humor?

605
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:29,441
Scott: Actually pretty decent production quality mostly cuz it's so popular.

606
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:35,119
Rym: how up my alley is a show about Smiling pirates seriously good.

607
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,163
Rym: God right.

608
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:37,969
Scott: I mean red shanks awesome.

609
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:41,227
Scott: the Kakashi, I think the guy patch guy is awesome.

610
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:43,860
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it's like bleach.

611
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,450
Scott: even you have these shows.

612
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:52,583
Scott: They could be the best shows And then they ruin them with all this pointless fighting crap in them.

613
00:38:52,663 --> 00:39:01,999
Scott: if you took the fighting out of Naruto And you said hey any Avius made every fight in Naruto Naruto a Choreographed fight like the first one in cowboy bebop.

614
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,590
Scott: We're actually animate people fighting and it's over really quickly.

615
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:07,808
Scott: It'll be maybe the best show ever.

616
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:13,310
Scott: It just might or it was funny ninja school just the whole way through 26 episodes of funny ninja school best show ever.

617
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:17,829
Scott: But maybe it could be and that's why it's so upsetting is that it's actually one of the worst shows there is.

618
00:39:18,332 --> 00:39:19,610
Scott: But and it's stupidly popular.

619
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:24,038
Scott: But it's 99% crap just pointless crap.

620
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,323
Scott: Dragon Ball is the same way.

621
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,610
Scott: at least the original Dragon Ball had more humor than DB.

622
00:39:27,771 --> 00:39:36,306
Rym: original Dragon Ball is actually pretty funny, and I've always looked at Dragon Ball Z as a kind of Self-reflective parody of those kinds of shows.

623
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,090
Scott: that's what it is.

624
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:42,199
Scott: But that's not the way most people view it and it's sort of set up You know with its ludicrous popularity.

625
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:51,050
Scott: if you don't understand the level of popularity of Dragon Ball Look at Japanese weekly Shonen jump sales figures, and then look what happens to those sales figures when Dragon Ball ended.

626
00:39:51,832 --> 00:39:59,230
Scott: But anyway, I think that the fact that people took deep Dragon Ball Z more seriously than I think it was intended.

627
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:03,465
Scott: But then again that is what sort of spawned that the current wave of.

628
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:04,810
Scott: you know Shonen jump fight.

629
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,350
Rym: That seems to be a common trend.

630
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:19,591
Rym: I mean we talked about this I think last week or the week before where a lot of anime fans Especially when they're young they see shows that are intended to be humorous and for whatever reason just don't pick up on that like project Aiko.

631
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:28,083
Rym: project Aiko is probably the biggest example because almost everyone I talked to when they were a kid Saw project Aiko and took it at face value, and they're like man.

632
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:29,587
Rym: Why does she have superpowers?

633
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:30,570
Rym: That's so cool.

634
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,039
Rym: Oh, she saved the day.

635
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:37,034
Rym: and now I look at it is like oh It's a joke Get it.

636
00:40:37,856 --> 00:40:40,083
Rym: I mean I was so into the drama of the.

637
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:42,490
Rym: you know the movie battle gray battle blue and all that.

638
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:46,050
Rym: I thought it was and then I saw it again, and it was just wow.

639
00:40:46,473 --> 00:40:54,135
Scott: Yeah, when I ever tell you when I first saw tank police I took it as seriously as someone that you're supposed to take something like Galaxy Express.

640
00:40:54,196 --> 00:40:56,990
Scott: and now well I still take Galaxy Express seriously.

641
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:00,243
Scott: I don't take tank police nearly half as seriously as I used to.

642
00:41:00,263 --> 00:41:07,641
Rym: that is not to say that I do not enjoy Tank police or project About half serious and project Aiko is about 5% serious.

643
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:08,222
Rym: Well.

644
00:41:08,262 --> 00:41:11,190
Rym: Don't read the tank police manga because the seriousness drops away.

645
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:13,056
Scott: I'm getting it eventually.

646
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:14,682
Rym: yeah, it's okay.

647
00:41:14,983 --> 00:41:20,563
Scott: Yeah, but the point is is that Naruto and all these other shonen fighting shows you really don't like them.

648
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:22,310
Scott: really think there's a waste of time.

649
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,528
Scott: But anyone is excused from watching or reading one of this.

650
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:28,239
Rym: well You know people are allowed to like whatever they want.

651
00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:35,609
Scott: they are allowed to like whatever they want, but if they want my respect No, you see they would need to enjoy one or fewer of these things.

652
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:39,424
Rym: I just I. I think the real issue is much simpler.

653
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:41,050
Rym: I don't like Naruto.

654
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,069
Rym: I think it's a bad show.

655
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:44,715
Scott: I think Naruto is bad.

656
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:51,657
Rym: the worst is when people on pieces bad people try to argue with me on that point because remember I Didn't say you shouldn't watch it.

657
00:41:51,697 --> 00:41:57,641
Rym: I said I think it's a bad show and people will argue no It's not it's a great show you.

658
00:41:57,702 --> 00:42:06,190
Rym: and then there's always that pause And I always look hopeful and then they always say you just have to get past the filler episodes.

659
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:08,502
Scott: That is the worst argument.

660
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:10,110
Rym: You can make just if you're gonna make.

661
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,216
Scott: You know what my argument to that is.

662
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:11,979
Scott: okay, okay?

663
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:13,728
Scott: All right, so it's a good show.

664
00:42:13,768 --> 00:42:14,030
Rym: I got it.

665
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:14,799
Rym: I got it much simpler.

666
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,609
Rym: We'll skip all that.

667
00:42:16,331 --> 00:42:21,009
Rym: I'll give you a dollar, but you have to get through me punching the crap out of you for five minutes first.

668
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,556
Scott: That sounds like a loss.

669
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:27,170
Scott: You know cuz I would pay a dollar to keep you from punching me for five minutes, huh?

670
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:34,918
Rym: So I mean I think the line for me in terms of because people always argue But yeah shows can have bad parts gotta wait till they get good.

671
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,597
Rym: I think gassaraki was the line that was the slowest show I actually finished.

672
00:42:40,797 --> 00:42:42,264
Scott: yeah, you look at this though right.

673
00:42:42,284 --> 00:42:45,455
Scott: someone says oh the show's really great If you just wait through the bad part.

674
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:48,084
Scott: well cowboy bebop doesn't have a bad part.

675
00:42:48,144 --> 00:42:49,890
Scott: try gun doesn't have a bad part.

676
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:54,367
Scott: So maybe the show that is part bad and part good is better than the show.

677
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:55,030
Scott: That's all bad.

678
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:55,909
Scott: I will give you that.

679
00:42:56,492 --> 00:43:00,749
Scott: But the show that is part bad and part good is not as good as the show that is all good.

680
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:06,330
Scott: now There are plenty of shows that are all good, and I don't have time to watch all of them.

681
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:08,379
Scott: So I'm not gonna have any time to watch.

682
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:09,926
Scott: your half bad have good show.

683
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,171
Scott: your half bad Have good.

684
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:15,424
Scott: show is might as it to me is as good as the all bad show.

685
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:18,913
Scott: breathe breathe fuck it Fuck it.

686
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:20,962
Rym: It's all fuck the fuck up.

687
00:43:21,244 --> 00:43:22,369
Scott: It's all fuck the fuck up.

688
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,776
Scott: But I'm economies off fuck fuck.

689
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:31,470
Rym: I'll say this bodega bodega baby Moses, okay, let's not get on those tangents.

690
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:41,569
Rym: I'll say when they're actually Woman tangents something I got nothing Naruto sucks.

691
00:43:43,235 --> 00:43:45,369
Rym: You know now I actually forgot what I was gonna say.

692
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:48,275
Rym: I had something needed.

693
00:43:48,817 --> 00:43:49,519
Rym: oh all right all right.

694
00:43:49,940 --> 00:44:00,710
Rym: the next time you ever try to convince and me or Yourself that a show that has a bad like a long bad part is worth watching to get to the good part Just go watch.

695
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,097
Rym: I don't know 12 kingdoms or Kazu.

696
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:06,628
Rym: no yo Jimbo cuz I guarantee you haven't seen those shows hardly anyone especially Kazu.

697
00:44:06,668 --> 00:44:09,197
Rym: no yo Jimbo That show is awesome.

698
00:44:09,217 --> 00:44:09,959
Scott: Have you watched it?

699
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,505
Scott: more than a few episodes that we've seen?

700
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:14,215
Rym: I saw the first six episodes And they were all awesome.

701
00:44:14,296 --> 00:44:17,530
Rym: I also saw the first except even if the show gets crappy after that.

702
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:17,952
Rym: You know what.

703
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:24,659
Rym: if a show starts good and turns crappy I get to watch the good part And then I stop watching and I don't lose anything.

704
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,442
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

705
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,968
Scott: It's actually not bad.

706
00:44:26,988 --> 00:44:27,570
Scott: It's like Naruto.

707
00:44:28,052 --> 00:44:29,298
Scott: Just watch four episodes.

708
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,770
Scott: You'll get all this goodness, and you won't lose anything.

709
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:32,352
Scott: It's actually.

710
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:33,577
Scott: then it's an amazing show.

711
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:46,090
Rym: if a show feels like I have to fight my it's kind of like Pokemon And why I gave up on it and stop playing it The moment anything that's supposed to be entertaining feels like work or like I just got to get through this part people.

712
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:50,352
Scott: Yeah, people say oh World of Warcraft is a good game once you get the level 70.

713
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:50,994
Scott: What I need to?

714
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:55,208
Scott: why would I work to get the fun part when I can just buy the fun part?

715
00:44:55,228 --> 00:44:55,910
Rym: there was a tiny.

716
00:44:56,176 --> 00:44:58,158
Rym: There was a time I would back in the day.

717
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:01,012
Rym: what I would play through like Final Fantasy 4j I think that is.

718
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:13,310
Scott: that's a topic for a separate show is the ongoing problem of the fact that when we were in college And I think most people who are in college or high school and younger than that have the same issue Is that they have plenty of free time and not a lot of money?

719
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:21,170
Scott: So they've got all this time to enjoy works of entertainment, but not enough works of entertainment to enjoy whereas us We don't have a lot of free time.

720
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:24,328
Scott: We need to go to work all day and commute and do all this other GeekNights stuff.

721
00:45:24,569 --> 00:45:27,083
Scott: Yeah We have plenty of money.

722
00:45:27,103 --> 00:45:36,074
Scott: so we have all these Entertainment things to enjoy but not enough time to enjoy them all and it when you have you know when you're you're when you're the sort of a high school kid.

723
00:45:36,114 --> 00:45:45,650
Scott: I can very easily excuse something like Naruto because it fills up a Lot of time need the pleasure of Scott to be just excused from watching they do because it fills up.

724
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:51,849
Scott: They have a lot of time on their hands and not a lot to be entertained by and whereas us We don't have time for Naruto.

725
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:54,042
Scott: Seriously, it's what I get to spend.

726
00:45:54,243 --> 00:45:57,437
Scott: if I spend the time watching Naruto I'm not gonna be able to do anything else at all.

727
00:45:57,638 --> 00:45:58,380
Rym: period.

728
00:45:58,401 --> 00:46:00,910
Rym: I have not beaten Twilight Princess.

729
00:46:01,452 --> 00:46:03,180
Rym: I got maybe three hours into it.

730
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:05,430
Rym: That's I just haven't had time, right?

731
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:11,548
Scott: So I think that's what we got to say and I hope we pissed people off by telling you that all these shows that you like suck.

732
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:16,290
Rym: I don't think many of the people who listen to GeekNights are particularly fans of Naruto.

733
00:46:16,521 --> 00:46:22,943
Scott: No But that's fine because even if they aren't I'm hoping that fans of Naruto will pay attention to the show and link to it And be all like these guys are.

734
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:23,589
Scott: do some art.

735
00:46:24,192 --> 00:46:26,118
Rym: Oh, you mean like what he made fun anime pulse.

736
00:46:26,178 --> 00:46:32,124
Rym: and then we got like what actually we got at least six people who came Over and said man now I listen to you guys.

737
00:46:32,386 --> 00:46:38,646
Scott: Yeah, so Naruto fans You know people post links to this show on all sorts of Naruto sites and other.

738
00:46:38,727 --> 00:46:39,389
Rym: you got nothing.

739
00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:40,332
Rym: others You got nothing.

740
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:41,275
Rym: you are nothing.

741
00:46:41,396 --> 00:46:42,499
Rym: I think you are nothing to me.

742
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,385
Scott: other shonen fighting shows also.

743
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:45,770
Scott: the same thing applies.

744
00:46:45,852 --> 00:46:46,588
Scott: I mean think about it.

745
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:54,964
Rym: Everything you've said about Naruto is true about one piece is true about dragon ball except initial D because that's awesome Until episode 27 and then it sucks and Scott is wrong.

746
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:56,109
Scott: I'm allowed one.

747
00:47:02,572 --> 00:47:04,777
