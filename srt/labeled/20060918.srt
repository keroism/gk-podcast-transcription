1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,372
Scott: It's Monday September 18th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:16,239
Scott: We will discuss the history of sound in personal computing.

3
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:19,296
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:23,699
Rym: Well, we're back from if you can't guess another somewhat crazy weekend.

5
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:26,330
Scott: Too crazy too crazy.

6
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:27,436
Rym: That wasn't too crazy.

7
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:33,060
Scott: We've had crazier Yeah, but it was too crazy considering I haven't had a. what was the last time we had a break weekend?

8
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,757
Rym: God, where's the last time I got a good night's sleep?

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,851
Rym: Yeah, not tonight, that's for sure.

10
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:44,818
Rym: no no not tonight It's too late Yeah, but we went off into the city with her friends Kate and Adam and with Emily to do some.

11
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,700
Rym: well Scott didn't participate because he is a pansy, but the rest of us did Japanese style karaoke.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,088
Scott: It's not cuz I'm a pansy is cuz?

13
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:53,140
Scott: I don't waste my time doing stupid karaoke.

14
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:54,663
Rym: You just don't get it.

15
00:00:54,704 --> 00:01:00,177
Rym: the sheer joy of singing Michael Jackson's beat it in a British accent was brought.

16
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:01,480
Scott: I rest my case.

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,330
Rym: Anyway, as usual.

18
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,500
Rym: It's Monday, and we're exhausted.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,300
Scott: Mm-hmm All right, so you want to just jump right into this news here?

20
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:11,244
Rym: I think we should.

21
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:12,870
Rym: I don't really want to talk about how tired I am.

22
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:14,417
Scott: yeah, I got nothing else.

23
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:31,056
Scott: so Apparently these guys in the quest to keep their computers cold without making lots of noise decided that they were going to use the technology of ionization to keep their computers cold.

24
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:37,480
Scott: now If you don't know there are these air filters that you can buy air purifiers you mean the old lady killers?

25
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:42,217
Scott: Exactly, okay, and what these things do is kill old ladies.

26
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:46,066
Scott: exactly They're basically these air filters.

27
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,189
Scott: You can buy that way.

28
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,433
Scott: they do filter the air.

29
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:53,751
Scott: They're they're not lying about that using Ions, I'm curious Scott.

30
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:54,738
Rym: Do you know how they actually work?

31
00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:57,720
Rym: barely you.

32
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:01,780
Rym: Okay, you create a charge right yeah?

33
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,880
Rym: And most particle a little static bits are often also somewhat charged and attract them to a plate.

34
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:15,994
Rym: It's the same reason that dust is attracted to your computer monitor No, and why TVs always get covered in dust computers always get covered in dust.

35
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:17,880
Rym: everything electronic gets covered in dust.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:29,508
Scott: You basically just make an electronic thing to gather the dust kinda yeah, so somehow they use this to move air Get and keep their computers cold and of course.

37
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,415
Scott: It's quiet because it's just electricity.

38
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:31,716
Scott: It's not.

39
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:33,884
Scott: there's no moving parts There's nothing vibrating.

40
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,711
Scott: There's nothing to make noise and it worked.

41
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:38,784
Scott: it cost a thousand dollars for the kit But it worked.

42
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,319
Rym: did you actually read the article as to how this works?

43
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:44,619
Scott: There's only like a paragraph here.

44
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,758
Rym: So we're not gonna have some sort of cool in-depth discussion of well How this technology is cool, and how it works and why you should all care about it.

45
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:56,878
Scott: We should care about it because it's a bad idea because you're going to fill your house with ozone and die.

46
00:02:56,898 --> 00:03:09,032
Rym: not necessarily Not necessarily, but probably I mean while I mean a lot of those early ionizers made a lot of ozone But I mean my Atari made a lot of ozone too.

47
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:11,967
Scott: Yeah, not as much as this thing though I don't know.

48
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,320
Rym: my Atari made a lot of ozone.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,146
Rym: It smelled like a thunderstorm after I played that.

50
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:22,009
Scott: but the other reason I chose this story is because it's on and gadget and in gadget Upgraded today to the new in gadget now.

51
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:23,072
Rym: Here's the sad part.

52
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:25,018
Rym: Scott said the upgraded in gadget.

53
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,454
Rym: It's awesome Go look, so I went and I didn't notice any difference at all.

54
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:30,880
Rym: It didn't look any different to me.

55
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:32,899
Rym: He had to point out what they had changed.

56
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,238
Scott: Well, the interesting things they done is number one you to post a comment on.

57
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:42,758
Scott: in gadget You used to have to confirm every comment by email, which is a nightmare and it really well.

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,651
Scott: No, it didn't hinder commenting on the gadget at all.

59
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,460
Scott: people still posted a jillion comments.

60
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:51,879
Rym: Why don't we change our forums to be that we have to personally approve each and every message people post?

61
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:54,570
Scott: It's not a good idea.

62
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,300
Scott: We already personally approve each and every person.

63
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:56,955
Scott: I think that's enough.

64
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:58,263
Scott: But they also.

65
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:02,533
Scott: it did make the reading comments on engage it basically impossible and useless.

66
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,220
Scott: now this comment moderation and everything.

67
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:11,860
Scott: So and also comment threading so you can read the comments and they make sense and they're useful.

68
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:16,345
Scott: The other thing they did is if you have a big monitor The picture is on and get.

69
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:23,628
Scott: you are now high resolution and they will expand on your bigger screens and and also Contract on your smaller screens.

70
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,900
Rym: No, they won't contract on the smaller screens at all.

71
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,125
Scott: That's as long as it's not.

72
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:30,600
Scott: but I think 1024 by 768 is the minimum resolution.

73
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:35,480
Rym: I I'm at a higher resolution than that and I could not make the image be any smaller or larger than it was.

74
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:37,524
Scott: I don't know.

75
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:38,127
Scott: It works.

76
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:40,295
Scott: I did it at work where the screens bigger.

77
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:44,133
Scott: I Had two screens at work and I just stretched it across both screens.

78
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:44,636
Scott: It went bloop.

79
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:48,307
Scott: Ah So it's for people with widescreens.

80
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:53,519
Scott: basically, you know, the widescreen monitors or giant projectors or HDTVs or what have you?

81
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,167
Scott: But yeah in gadget is cooler.

82
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,920
Scott: Now if you like gadgets, I don't know why you're not reading in gadget.

83
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,188
Rym: Well, you could read gizmodo.

84
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,180
Scott: Yeah, which has some problems.

85
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,868
Scott: It's basically like I used to.

86
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:11,862
Scott: they were both basically equal back in the day But over time and gadget has been you know, beating gizmodo Puncher pun.

87
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:16,015
Rym: I pretty much just read slash down in Kotaku and I ignore the whole gadget thing.

88
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:20,242
Scott: and gadget also has a fun podcast Which is cool All right.

89
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:22,370
Scott: I know you listen to podcast because you're listening to this.

90
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:28,596
Rym: No, remember a lot of our listeners don't listen other podcasts Yeah, but you know, they listen to at least one podcast.

91
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:32,147
Scott: They might listen to two If they might see if they're all you know.

92
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:35,820
Rym: for all you know, they're listening on some pirate radio station somewhere.

93
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:40,052
Scott: Hey, if you're playing us in a pirate radio station, we don't care.

94
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,380
Scott: We want it because you're allowed to with the Creative Commons.

95
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:43,826
Scott: Just tell us about it.

96
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:44,710
Scott: Don't be all secret.

97
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:48,859
Rym: thing is they don't even have to tell us the way we set it up Yeah, but they do have to give us credit.

98
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:54,360
Scott: Yeah So they have to tell the people that are listening to us on the pirate radio station what they're listening to.

99
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,799
Rym: But do they really because we give ourselves credit unless they cut off the closing bid Even though the closing bid is old and out of date and season two will rectify that.

100
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:08,240
Scott: I think the license actually says like they have to credit, you know, it's like they have to do something.

101
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,108
Scott: It can't just be us crediting ourselves.

102
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,212
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

103
00:06:11,453 --> 00:06:12,658
Rym: Yeah, I really wouldn't care.

104
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:14,146
Scott: either way It died and really care either.

105
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,655
Scott: but I would like to know that's all.

106
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,520
Scott: that's all I wanted.

107
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:19,057
Scott: They should they should have a new Creative Commons license, you know.

108
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:21,814
Scott: Attribution share alike no commercial.

109
00:06:22,075 --> 00:06:22,598
Scott: Let us know.

110
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,839
Scott: You know Alright yep.

111
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:35,559
Rym: Anyway This actually was somewhat surprising news because it goes against the trend of this entire Industry for the past two decades if not more.

112
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:48,880
Rym: Now a while ago it came out that Universal was going to sue the ever-living hell out of YouTube for The such horrible crimes as someone lip-syncing to one of their songs in a crappy resolution video.

113
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:59,254
Rym: Oh shits they want to shut YouTube down because it does nothing but facilitate this grievous Violation of copyright law and you know deprive their children of bread and all that sort of.

114
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:01,200
Scott: have they heard of anime music videos?

115
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:02,499
Rym: You know what?

116
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:09,440
Rym: I'm really surprised that the anime industry has gotten away completely unscathed so far in this AMV business.

117
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:17,811
Scott: It's the anime industry isn't making the AMVs and they're not hosting the AMVs and they're promoting the AMVs Except that the conventions are straight up with tournaments.

118
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:20,340
Scott: They sure are all these fan-run conventions.

119
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:22,571
Rym: Yeah, I mean even Otakon they.

120
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:24,260
Rym: they escape any sort of ire about it.

121
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,119
Rym: Hey, but the thing is Warner music has come out and said you know what?

122
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:41,920
Rym: YouTube can use any of the music videos we've got and they can take any part of those music videos Which obviously includes the music in them and do whatever they want in a non-commercial way.

123
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:48,151
Rym: All they have to do is put it back on YouTube for other people to say yeah I think that this might be the turn of the tide.

124
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:50,160
Rym: this might be Gandalf standing here saying, huh?

125
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,952
Scott: I think what it is is that someone at Warner music fine.

126
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,718
Scott: There's someone there with a brain.

127
00:07:55,859 --> 00:08:04,919
Scott: finally there's someone at this place with a brain and what they're thinking is a Music video isn't really like a creative work that you're trying to sell.

128
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:08,840
Scott: It's an advertisement that you want as many people to see and hear as possible.

129
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:16,752
Rym: I mean if you don't believe that most music videos you just can't get they're not available It's not like you can buy a DVD that has all the music videos you want.

130
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:19,623
Rym: Sometimes you can yeah sometimes but most They're not out there.

131
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:23,036
Scott: Yeah, music videos are advertisements for bands.

132
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:24,421
Scott: That's what they are That's.

133
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:28,819
Scott: MTV is just a TV network that shows ads all day long.

134
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:31,081
Scott: I mean if it still showed videos But it doesn't.

135
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:45,900
Rym: but unless you want to know how old we are when MTV came about and we watched it as kids the only non Music video content was like the night cartoon blog with Beavis and Butthead and MTV News and MTV News.

136
00:08:48,781 --> 00:09:06,700
Scott: Yep nowadays, it's pretty much all the music videos and like MTV too, but the point is is that Someone at Warner music was saying hey if we put this shit on YouTube It'll be like free advertising that a billions of people well not billions, but millions of people will look at it constantly every day.

137
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:13,200
Rym: Isn't that what geeks and people who know better have been trying to tell the music industry for the last 20 fucking years?

138
00:09:13,582 --> 00:09:29,048
Rym: Yeah, and one person finally said, uh Now this is big news for one reason one reason alone Universal is with the status quo and Warner has just done something that at least for the music industry is Absolutely batshit crazy.

139
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:48,037
Scott: I think it's only a matter of time before Someone discovers like some unknown band that long ago signed like a one-out signed a record contract with Univer with Warner, you know made one music video in one album then disappeared off the face of the earth Because it didn't sell and now it's gonna become crazy popular.

140
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:52,220
Scott: now I wonder because someone's gonna make a funny video like Numa Numa to it or something.

141
00:09:52,564 --> 00:10:04,831
Rym: I'm waiting for the next Thing to happen the next company to react to this because if another company says we're doing what Warner did That is probably the beginning of a new era of copyright.

142
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:13,997
Scott: And if that doesn't think it is the thing though, is that the Even though they're giving the music videos away, which are essentially advertisements.

143
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:29,280
Scott: There's still advertisements for The CDs and stuff so they still need to have Either the overpriced CDs or the DRM stuff or at least they think they do in order to sell something to you.

144
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:34,511
Scott: This is just saying alright, we were previously Pretending our advertisements were products.

145
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:35,114
Scott: now.

146
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:36,660
Scott: We're not gonna pretend that anymore.

147
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,380
Scott: We're gonna you know, put our advertisements to get as much exposure for them as possible.

148
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:45,155
Scott: Watch our commercials all you want, but our product is still copyright.

149
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:46,259
Scott: blah blah blah blah blah.

150
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:49,970
Rym: Well, yeah but the thing is now at least because you can't.

151
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:56,793
Rym: the argument that oh I can just steal the music is separate from the Argument that I can use the music to create better things non commercially.

152
00:10:56,813 --> 00:11:00,566
Rym: Mm-hmm if they're allowing the latter I'm so much more.

153
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:12,399
Rym: Okay with them cracking down on people who pirate the music Is the man I mean way back when this whole music industry thing and you know mp3s really started getting bad and nabster suddenly got sued by a bunch of people.

154
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:33,860
Rym: if The right the industry had been reasonable at all at any point along the way Then it wouldn't have been an issue at all because people probably would have generally said yeah, we can't steal their music But the record industry they were just such dicks about it to be perfectly blunt that Most people who knew better or knew about the technology just said, you know, what fine screw you we're done with you.

155
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,950
Rym: We're going to destroy your industry.

156
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,959
Rym: There's nothing you can do about it.

157
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:45,960
Scott: Yeah, also another thing though, is that if they're letting anyone, you know remix any of their songs in any way they want You know, of course, it's within the confines of YouTube.

158
00:11:46,120 --> 00:12:01,520
Scott: But if they're doing that right a big one of the major arguments against all the things record companies are doing is you're hindering Creativity because now with copyright no one can use fair use to your remix and create new things with your music.

159
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:08,074
Scott: But if they're gonna let people do that Then it really shoots a lot of arguments against them just gone.

160
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:09,880
Scott: It's like no we're gonna let you do all that.

161
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,603
Scott: We're just not gonna.

162
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:10,924
Rym: you know what.

163
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:12,912
Rym: it doesn't shoot down to be a cynic here.

164
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:20,346
Scott: It doesn't shoot down the economics argument But yeah, but you know It does shoot down a whole lot of the argument.

165
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:27,580
Rym: in the very least I expect to see a boom of Warner music related YouTube funny bits in the next several months.

166
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,500
Scott: I predict Warner music will not do as well as music record companies did in their peak.

167
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,520
Scott: However, they were going to beat the other record companies into the ground unless they follow suit or at least they'll beat Universal.

168
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,306
Rym: Yeah, because Universal now has basically infinite bad press among geeks.

169
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:44,766
Scott: Yep.

170
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,039
Rym: It's me.

171
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:55,597
Rym: Yeah, I saw hockey Kicking your ass.

172
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:58,478
Scott: Not I think in a day.

173
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:08,757
Rym: Yeah, you see we mentioned last week and for all of our new listeners This isn't what we normally do but we're doing something different because it's a very special time of the year.

174
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:19,560
Scott: Yes If you are not aware Training camp for the NHL has just ended and the preseason is starting any minute now.

175
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:28,640
Rym: now many of you are geeks and some of you are nerds as Since the show's GeekNights is definitely not an insult to call you either one of those because we are also self-identified.

176
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,425
Rym: But you might be wondering

177
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:31,006
Scott: why

178
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:37,918
Rym: are Rym and Scott the hosts of GeekNights about to talk about sports something that traditionally is anathema to nerds

179
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:41,474
Scott: Because sports aren't all bad and

180
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:49,200
Rym: in fact Well, we talk a lot about geekery and we you know, we cover the main geekeries, but you can be a geek in anything.

181
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,364
Rym: I mean there are car geeks.

182
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:51,769
Rym: There are sports geeks.

183
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,860
Rym: Yeah, they're also car nerds and sports nerds.

184
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,200
Scott: They're scarier, you know, you want to avoid those people.

185
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,827
Rym: I mean a job like you know when a lot of people talk about.

186
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:07,719
Rym: we had a guy in the forums who went nuts about this about Damn those jocks with their stupid sports and our sports centric culture and that's you know.

187
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:13,520
Rym: You call them a jock, but they're really just a sports nerd because they can only identify with other people through sports.

188
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,759
Rym: But they're no better off or worse off than a chess nerd.

189
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:20,093
Scott: Yeah, it's just that old stereotype of you know.

190
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:21,699
Scott: revenge of the nerds against the evil.

191
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,077
Scott: Yeah, then try lambs.

192
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:30,840
Scott: but It's really, you know, we don't see that as really existing.

193
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:34,260
Scott: I mean we went to a tech school the nerdiest school in the world.

194
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:37,100
Rym: It was also one of the most hockey in schools in the world.

195
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:42,900
Scott: But the ice hockey team man if that arena wasn't full for every goddamn home game.

196
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:50,395
Rym: Now also as another good thing when we're talking about hockey, right It seems that of all of these sports in the u.s.

197
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:57,296
Rym: The major sports Hockey has probably the biggest nerd and geek following if any of them nice.

198
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:58,360
Scott: It seems to be that way.

199
00:14:58,602 --> 00:15:03,871
Rym: I mean all a lot of the big tech schools though It might be simply because the tech schools happen to be a lot in the north

200
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:12,860
Scott: and the east or it's that the non tech schools Concentrate so heavily on other sports that the only place the tech schools can get an edge in any sport is the less popular ice.

201
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:19,280
Scott: Or it's because you know, we happen to be in the north very close to Canada above the Messier line.

202
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:22,609
Scott: Yeah, this is an old joke, I don't know.

203
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:22,991
Scott: I couldn't.

204
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:24,500
Scott: I've looked it for the picture online.

205
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:43,596
Scott: I can't find it again But this is funny map on the internet and someone drew and they basically drew a horizontal line across the middle of the United States you know, uh and It says this is the Messier line and above the Messier line Which is the top half of the United States and Canada it says hockey and below that line.

206
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:44,419
Scott: It says no hockey.

207
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:46,706
Scott: Now there are many.

208
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:52,763
Scott: there are many NHL teams below the Messier line like the Florida Panthers Or the.

209
00:15:53,145 --> 00:16:00,160
Scott: that is not however hockey the Nashville Predators But anyone who lives above the messy line is like whatever.

210
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:10,885
Scott: Yeah, now we're geeks We're super geeks, but we are also really into hockey and not just ice hockey for the NES Which is the best sports game ever?

211
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:24,044
Rym: Yes now someday we're going to tell the stories of the hockey games at RIT Because RIT hockey it was probably one of the greatest things that was ever happened to me in college Indeed.

212
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:26,072
Rym: I mean it's in the top 10 at least.

213
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:37,208
Scott: however to get to the point To celebrate the beginning of a new ice hockey season the second ice hockey season since the dang Unspeakable strike I just spoke of it.

214
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:40,159
Scott: But yeah, which ruined much of hockey.

215
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:47,437
Scott: We are going to attempt to slightly promote hockey by showing you the most entertaining part of hockey all this week.

216
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:49,544
Scott: for things of the day We're going to.

217
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:50,286
Scott: it is now.

218
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:54,159
Scott: Yeah hockey fight week all hockey fights all the time.

219
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:59,300
Rym: Now remember that we're gonna mean with each fight we're gonna try to highlight a different aspect of hockey.

220
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,275
Rym: But there are non fighting aspects to hockey and we enjoy those too.

221
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:04,559
Rym: We enjoy them very much.

222
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,414
Rym: However, hockey fights are freaking hilarious.

223
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:08,460
Rym: Even if you don't like hockey.

224
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,791
Scott: That's the point the reason we've chosen hockey fights as our.

225
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:13,800
Scott: you know, I'm not gonna show you amazing goals.

226
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:18,579
Scott: You know cuz but you know, if you don't like hockey the goal isn't going to be amazing or exciting.

227
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:25,617
Rym: Yeah Plus the goal doesn't mean anything really unless you know the team's behind it and you care and you're curious.

228
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:26,220
Rym: and it's it's not.

229
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,812
Rym: It's not that but anyone can appreciate two guys Punching each other in the face for like two minutes until one of them passes out.

230
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:37,915
Scott: even a complete total chest nerd Chest boxing just boxing.

231
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:49,520
Rym: now I'll start with my thing of the day because I chose it for a very specific reason in addition to showing a Fantastic hockey fight a hockey fight that I was in the arena live to watch in person.

232
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,780
Rym: But it also illustrates that hockey fighting isn't just two guys beating each other up.

233
00:17:55,081 --> 00:18:06,440
Rym: There's a lot to it and hopefully you'll kind of get a perspective as to why hockey fights are so absolutely Freaking amazing and why there are fights in hockey and not in other sports and why that's okay.

234
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,228
Rym: Yeah, I mean how rare is there?

235
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:11,100
Rym: I mean you're watching a baseball game and suddenly there's a fight.

236
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:22,579
Scott: Yeah, like a few times a year and it is about as many hockey fights in a week of hockey as there are in a Year of baseball there are about as many hockey fights as there are periods of ice hockey in a given season.

237
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:29,713
Rym: Alright so this see I grew up in hockey town Detroit.

238
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:36,979
Rym: Detroit is one of the most Hockey centric cities in the non Canadian northern United States.

239
00:18:37,762 --> 00:18:39,168
Rym: Hockey is big there.

240
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:41,759
Rym: hockey is big there like Jesus is big in Spain.

241
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:58,089
Rym: and there was this man named Claude Lemieux who he is pretty much widely regarded by even many of his own teammates back in the day as the cheapest wimpiest Turtling yet bite-causing Annoying pest to ever be a hockey player.

242
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:01,080
Rym: This guy was responsible for so many fights.

243
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:07,604
Rym: He injured players all the time But whenever he got into a fight his typical reaction was to turtle Meaning.

244
00:19:07,825 --> 00:19:10,178
Rym: he'd curl up in a ball and hope that the referee saved him.

245
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:11,785
Scott: Awesome.

246
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:15,223
Rym: Now he was responsible for a lot of horrific injuries but there was also.

247
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:24,187
Rym: he played for the Colorado Avalanche back then and the Colorado Avalanche and the Detroit Red Wings had this Crazy crazy rivalry going on.

248
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,960
Scott: a bunch of Russian guys pitch pissed off at a bunch of Canadian guys.

249
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:30,234
Rym: Pretty much there were no Americans involved.

250
00:19:30,274 --> 00:19:37,880
Rym: Yeah And what happened was that at one point Claude Lemieux got this really cheap shot and hurt one of the Red Wings.

251
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,873
Rym: Now they were gonna take it and they weren't gonna deal with this.

252
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:42,616
Rym: They weren't gonna take it.

253
00:19:42,677 --> 00:19:43,279
Rym: This was the end.

254
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:46,518
Rym: So they had one of the enforcers on the team.

255
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,339
Rym: now Here's some terminology for you.

256
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:58,136
Rym: If you're a fan of a hockey team the big guys who cause fights are called enforcers because they protect your good players From the other teams thugs.

257
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:01,729
Rym: and Now any other hockey team that you are not a fan of.

258
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,547
Rym: their big guys are thugs and all they do is start fights unjustly.

259
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:06,839
Scott: that is correct.

260
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:11,876
Rym: So that basically they hated Claude Lemieux and now there's about to be a face-off.

261
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:12,759
Rym: They're about to drop the puck.

262
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:19,198
Rym: the Red Wing Immediately jumps him and beats the ever-living hell out of him.

263
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,666
Scott: That's what he does.

264
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:22,934
Rym: That's all I got to say about that.

265
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:23,920
Rym: Just watch the video.

266
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,020
Rym: It'll probably explain a little bit about how hockey fights come about and why they're the way they are at least a little bit Mm-hmm.

267
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:38,581
Scott: now me who was born in Queens, New York and grew up in Connecticut is a me is yes me Is.

268
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:39,807
Scott: I'm getting ready for pirate day.

269
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:53,340
Scott: I Am by genetics I think a fan of the New York Rangers who Play in the world's most famous arena Madison Square Garden and are the most expensive team in hockey.

270
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:57,919
Rym: Garden doesn't have it doesn't have a statue of Joe Louis's fist.

271
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:01,424
Scott: I don't know.

272
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:04,434
Scott: It has managed square Joe Louis's fist.

273
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:05,457
Scott: Whatever.

274
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:10,900
Scott: It's huge anyway, and They are the most expensive.

275
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:41,281
Scott: I'm not sure if they're still the most expensive team but in terms of what it costs to pay all their players They're the most expensive team in hockey And I think it's the only team that like every single relative I have is a fan of the Rangers and we care more about the hockey than the other sports even though, you know, we kind of care about the other sports, but Anyway, when I was really watching like every Ranger game on MSG every night when I was a kid, you know The enforcer of the Rangers the key one was a man named oof Samuelson.

276
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:48,280
Scott: it's a obviously a north of northern European descent and he was a large dangerous and scary man.

277
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,413
Rym: Yep, we had a man named Shanahan.

278
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:54,308
Scott: Yeah, but oof Samuelson I would see him about.

279
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:57,040
Scott: you know, a few times a week beat the shit out of somebody.

280
00:21:57,802 --> 00:22:05,715
Scott: Well, I went and I searched for him on the YouTube and the Google video and I found only one video for you to see oof Samuelson in action.

281
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:10,469
Scott: and This isn't a video of oof Samuelson beating anyone up.

282
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:27,228
Scott: This is a video of another hockey player Ty Domi who is also an ass a thug You will from some other team that isn't even worth mentioning who Takes a cheap shot at oof Samuelson and knocks him out one hit.

283
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:36,707
Scott: Basically what had happened was I'm linking to the 10-second video, but you'll see on in YouTube There's another video with a different camera angle.

284
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:40,898
Scott: That's like two minutes long and that will let you see the whole situation.

285
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:44,220
Scott: where Ty Domi tripped oof Samuelson.

286
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:51,039
Scott: That got him a two-minute penalty Which means he's out of the game because it's only less than two minutes left in the game.

287
00:22:51,682 --> 00:22:56,339
Scott: So they're gonna have a power play no matter what and he's out of the game for the rest of this game no matter what?

288
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:03,944
Scott: So why not punch oof Samuelson in the face and injure him and then he'll be out of the game, too And it'll be.

289
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:06,117
Scott: you'll at least take someone with you.

290
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,225
Scott: So that's exactly what he did.

291
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:13,955
Scott: and they like they bring out the stretcher to carry oof away and it's it's pretty entertaining to show you.

292
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:21,114
Scott: You know it goes both ways in the hockey fights like a bisexual exactly anyway.

293
00:23:21,575 --> 00:23:23,419
Rym: We're not gonna dwell on that anymore now.

294
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,060
Scott: tomorrow We're just gonna go to with two hockey.

295
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:36,160
Rym: I hope that wasn't too much needless exposition But we really wanted to set the stage because I can guarantee to you that the magnitude of the videos We will be linking to this week will only increase.

296
00:23:36,903 --> 00:23:41,625
Scott: Yeah, if you think that these hockey fights are like oh shits wait You know wait do you see?

297
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,940
Scott: the hockey fights are gonna link to tomorrow the next day the next day.

298
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,259
Scott: Yeah, don't spoil it by going around Google video and YouTube just searching for hockey fights cuz that's you know.

299
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,340
Rym: yeah We're basically doing kind of a. we'll give you the cream of the crop here.

300
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:56,097
Scott: Yeah, we filter it for you if you go searching around looking at everything yourself.

301
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:56,680
Scott: What's the point?

302
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:00,192
Rym: All right, and of course it'll culminate in Thursday where there's a good chance.

303
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:01,257
Rym: We'll talk about hockey.

304
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:04,020
Scott: yeah Straight up, that'll be crazy.

305
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:13,280
Rym: Anyway, all right so on to the main bit Which is partly a cop-out because we're exhausted, and if you can't tell it was the only thing we came up with.

306
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:15,199
Rym: We're trying to finish this show so I can go to bed.

307
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,820
Scott: Yep, we're gonna talk to you today about the history of sound and sound cards and sound chips in personal computers.

308
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:30,219
Rym: Yep Not so much from the technical perspective because I doubt many of you care and because if we get anything wrong James Lee gal at Us well someone will yell at us.

309
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,091
Rym: Yeah, well if we get anything wrong about the electronics James Lee gal at us.

310
00:24:33,232 --> 00:24:38,110
Rym: if we get anything wrong about the music or the Chips they're can only yell at us someone else.

311
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:39,274
Scott: We're so we're gonna.

312
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:41,140
Scott: You know be a lot of our stuff.

313
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,120
Scott: We're just reading off the internet, but we've done a bunch.

314
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:50,079
Scott: It's it's a collected research to save you time yeah And also to teach you and hopefully entertain now you kids.

315
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:55,320
Rym: I don't want to call you kids, but you kids have it easy today because any sound card works.

316
00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:56,559
Rym: I mean you buy a new computer.

317
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,570
Rym: There's probably just a sound card that work.

318
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,546
Rym: that'll work fine just built into the motherboard Every computer.

319
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:02,631
Rym: you just don't even worry about it.

320
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:04,500
Rym: sound cards are a commodity.

321
00:25:04,682 --> 00:25:06,479
Rym: They're pretty much all the same.

322
00:25:06,861 --> 00:25:11,740
Rym: There's no reason to even worry about them at all unless you're making music and even then your options are fairly limited.

323
00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:17,282
Rym: back in the day Wasn't quite like that before Soundblasters.

324
00:25:17,623 --> 00:25:19,751
Rym: there really wasn't sound in computers.

325
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:21,799
Rym: the way you think about sound all right.

326
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:28,222
Scott: well I think the one technical thing we have to talk about is the difference between PCM and Synthesizers.

327
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:31,050
Rym: yeah, let also people will remember MIDI.

328
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:38,092
Scott: Yeah, well MIDI is related to that, but yeah basically A synthesizer is a musical instrument.

329
00:25:38,354 --> 00:25:41,826
Scott: It's an electronic musical instrument But it is an instrument nonetheless.

330
00:25:42,428 --> 00:25:47,022
Scott: the what a synthesizer does is it takes some sort of Inputs.

331
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:57,518
Scott: you know digital inputs usually dials switches sometimes even analog inputs like some waves or something and then there is some sort of logic in a chip.

332
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:02,095
Scott: and What it does is it takes the based upon the inputs.

333
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:05,260
Scott: it generates some sort of analog output.

334
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:14,969
Scott: So you it's basically a machine that makes waves and sounds in a certain way Where if you keep giving it you know the same input.

335
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:21,375
Scott: if you set the dials to the same place and push the same buttons It'll make the same sound and that's what a synthesizer is.

336
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:32,306
Scott: and back in the day Most sound chips in computers because I mean this wasn't in the day of sound cards This is in the days were like you had an Apple 2 and there was a sound chip on the in the computer And that was it.

337
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:38,472
Scott: or you had a Macintosh 512 K you know and in the Macintosh was a sound chip and that was it.

338
00:26:38,854 --> 00:26:42,208
Rym: or if any of you were too young for that a Nintendo or a Super Nintendo.

339
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:46,223
Rym: yeah, those things could make PCM They could play that.

340
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:52,080
Rym: but for the most part the vast majority of what you heard was synthesized using square waves sawtooth waves triangle waves.

341
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,847
Scott: Yep, you know it was.

342
00:26:53,867 --> 00:27:20,030
Scott: basically there was an instrument inside your computer a chip that was also a musical instrument and The computer programs your games or your software or your operating system or some other program on your computer Would send digital information or do some computation and then based upon that computation send Digital control signals you know zeros and ones to the musical instrument to play it.

343
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:29,567
Scott: So it was as if there was a little man inside your computer Who was sending zeros and ones to a musical instrument and depending on which zeros and ones he sent.

344
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:30,650
Scott: he was playing that instrument.

345
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:38,310
Scott: you know it was pretty crazy because Each computer had a different instrument in it so each computer made different music.

346
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:44,170
Rym: Yep, you really couldn't rely on a computer to sound the same especially when it came to even later on with things like MIDI.

347
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:49,395
Rym: Now MIDI is a lot more complicated than I'm gonna make it out to be and it's not actually Like people think.

348
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,969
Rym: MIDI is just a kind of music file, and it's not at all what it is.

349
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:53,834
Rym: It's just us.

350
00:27:53,975 --> 00:27:55,541
Rym: It's basically sheet music for a computer.

351
00:27:56,264 --> 00:28:13,609
Rym: you put it in and it says oh I'll make this is from play this and this is from play this and a lot of games back in the day used MIDI to make the music and also a lot of people collected MIDI files and For the most part they sounded completely different on everyone's computer because everyone had different little instruments stored in their MIDI

352
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,452
Scott: Mm-hmm.

353
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:18,650
Scott: you know and that was in the days You can even change what instruments are stored in there.

354
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,694
Scott: You know a lot of people.

355
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:21,803
Scott: just there was the default one and that was it.

356
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:33,210
Scott: yep now You know back in the day what you had like in an Apple to GS had like this Ensonique chip which was like the same one that was in professional synthesizers.

357
00:28:33,731 --> 00:28:36,298
Scott: But then the Commodore was the most famous.

358
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:37,420
Scott: it had these SID chip.

359
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:45,102
Rym: now you may remember this is from some bands that we like Like one band like makani supremacy possibly.

360
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,510
Scott: yeah, there's also an OC remix.

361
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:56,430
Scott: there's a lot of Commodore 64 remixes, and you the SID chip is is a very famous chip because The the way something to do with the manufacturer.

362
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:06,850
Scott: I don't remember exactly what but no two SID chips sound exactly the same as each other and It has a very distinctive sound that sounds like nothing else.

363
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:26,708
Scott: So When you hear Commodore music you go oh And you know that that is a famous very important sound chip.

364
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:34,490
Rym: But things didn't get interesting until the ad-lib came out yep ad-lib and then not too long after that sound blaster.

365
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:40,010
Scott: Yeah before it wasn't until see before the PC the IBM PC.

366
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:43,430
Scott: You know every computer was a special device.

367
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,521
Scott: You know you had an Apple - and you got Apple - software.

368
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:48,146
Scott: you had a Commodore.

369
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,190
Scott: you got Commodore software.

370
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,874
Scott: You had an Amiga.

371
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,390
Rym: you got Amiga software, but pcs were standard.

372
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,754
Rym: I mean you had a PC.

373
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:56,382
Rym: you could everyone everyone's the same and everyone.

374
00:29:56,483 --> 00:30:08,149
Rym: everyone had DOS or Windows on their PC And then you could put any hardware in there you could buy standard peripherals like by a drive And you know that that drive could work on any one of these that they would all work the same yep.

375
00:30:08,731 --> 00:30:26,187
Scott: So the first real you know popular well-used sound card was the ad-lib and the ad-lib was basically a synthesizer on a board and they made this thing and they sold it and Everyone got one if they wanted sound in their PC.

376
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:33,556
Rym: now It wasn't that great and it didn't really explode until not too long after the sound blasters Which were very similar to the ad-libs.

377
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:37,788
Scott: well what happened was is the ad-lib was actually a very simple card to make.

378
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:43,988
Scott: so once Everyone bought an ad-lib they looked at it And they said I can make that and they went to Radio Shack and they bought a bunch of chips and they made it.

379
00:30:44,189 --> 00:31:02,240
Scott: yeah and so everyone and their mother was selling ad-lib cards and You know some of them sounded different, but that didn't matter, but the sound blaster 1.0 Was basically an ad-lib card with a single PCM channel and a game port which is very important

380
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:05,007
Rym: yes because remember back in the day there was no USB.

381
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:09,195
Rym: if you wanted to Have a joystick Basically the only way that would happen was.

382
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:12,405
Rym: you had a serial joystick which sucked sucked ass.

383
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:15,757
Rym: there were some parallel peripherals Which also sucked for reasons.

384
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:19,570
Scott: yeah, you could plug your joystick into the printer port which sucked Yeah.

385
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:24,847
Rym: Or you can have a sound card that had a game controller and many sound cards.

386
00:31:24,887 --> 00:31:28,918
Rym: also had CD-ROM Controllers because CD-ROMs weren't IDE back then.

387
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:29,941
Scott: no they were.

388
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:39,630
Rym: CD-ROMs were this special thing and sound cards for Various reasons that we're not going to get into ended up also being CD-ROM controllers and joystick controllers.

389
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,722
Scott: Yeah, part of it had to.

390
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:41,510
Scott: well the reasons.

391
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:55,399
Scott: They were joystick controllers because the game port the port that old-school PC game Game pads and joysticks plugged into on the sound card was also the same kind of hole that MIDI Controllers and MIDI devices go into.

392
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,873
Rym: well it wasn't the same kind of hole for the most part But it was pin.

393
00:31:58,973 --> 00:32:05,646
Rym: it was pin identical in that you could plug a thing into it and just route the pins to different Shape connectors, and they would have two standard MIDI holes.

394
00:32:05,928 --> 00:32:08,297
Scott: yep So they had the same.

395
00:32:08,337 --> 00:32:14,810
Scott: they put a hole a little connector on the sound card that you would use for MIDI And then they could also use it for video game controllers.

396
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:24,864
Rym: I remember I had a little device that would plug into my game port and then it split off into two midis and It extended the joystick part so I could keep my joystick plugged in.

397
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:30,250
Rym: hmm of course I had to make sure not to futz with my joystick while I was recording music or anything.

398
00:32:31,851 --> 00:32:33,816
Rym: Yeah, but we'll skip a whole bunch of history.

399
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:42,150
Rym: up until pretty much the revolution in sound when the sound blaster 16 came out That was the first modern sound card.

400
00:32:42,391 --> 00:32:48,251
Rym: It was indeed is the first sound card that would basically be able to do almost all the things that your sound card today Can do.

401
00:32:49,074 --> 00:32:53,490
Rym: it could play music at normal bit rates at normal sampling rates.

402
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:55,997
Rym: It could play more than one sound at the same time.

403
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:00,370
Rym: it was pretty much that was when sound started mattering in games.

404
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:02,137
Scott: Yeah, oh, I forgot to me.

405
00:33:02,478 --> 00:33:04,949
Scott: see we I believe been talking about synthesizing up until now.

406
00:33:05,431 --> 00:33:13,009
Scott: PCM which is all I'm gonna call it right now instead of confusing you is Pretty much all you're doing with your sound card today.

407
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:20,165
Scott: PCM is a way of representing sound as a bunch of zeros and ones modern sound cards.

408
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:27,209
Scott: all you're really doing is sending them PCM and then they turn the PCM into sound and you hear it.

409
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:29,370
Rym: yep So now some games use synthesized music.

410
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:35,009
Rym: But usually what will happen is the game will synthesize it itself in the software and then send the result to your sound card.

411
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:39,086
Rym: that Way no matter what sound card you have it'll always sound the same.

412
00:33:39,106 --> 00:33:48,130
Scott: Mm-hmm I mean you have a CPU in your computer That is a processor which can process anything and you can send it any software you want and it'll do it.

413
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:59,352
Scott: So you can write a piece of software that does the same thing as a very old synthesizer or a very new synthesizer And if the CPU is fast enough it can take you know Any inputs.

414
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:00,976
Scott: process them in the same way.

415
00:34:01,016 --> 00:34:03,543
Scott: the synthesizer would get PCM's.

416
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:06,049
Scott: send the PCM's to your sound card and you'll hear it.

417
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:09,639
Rym: That's how it works now pretty much back then.

418
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:16,342
Rym: in order to use the sound card you had to especially in games You had to know a lot about your sound card.

419
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:17,889
Rym: You had to know how it was configured.

420
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:25,409
Rym: you had to know all the bio stuff that was set up and It the gauge game had to specifically support each sound card.

421
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:32,717
Rym: So you'd buy a game like tie fighter and then you'd run the setup program and it would say What sound card do you have?

422
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:37,989
Rym: and it would have a list of like ten and if you didn't have one of those ten It was probably not going to work.

423
00:34:38,422 --> 00:34:44,969
Rym: Yeah Now the list was like seven sound blaster cards to ad lib cards and then an author that never works.

424
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,139
Scott: Well, the famous one is Wolfenstein 3d.

425
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,382
Scott: in the options menu had to add three choices Adlib sound blaster and none.

426
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:53,770
Scott: those are your three choices.

427
00:34:54,391 --> 00:35:02,759
Scott: but eventually because what was happening was most people went with sound blasters and Other people wanted to also be able to sell sound cards.

428
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,690
Scott: They ended up making their sound cards sound blaster compatible.

429
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,378
Scott: so if you chose sound blaster, it would still work.

430
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,227
Scott: and so the way they you know got around.

431
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:19,889
Scott: this problem of Everyone had to you know, make their software specific to one sound card is by making all the sound cards the same.

432
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:22,376
Rym: Yep, God my first computer came with.

433
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:29,400
Rym: it was an HP that came with a fort 16 sound card and God was that thing as my Aptiva came with a sound blaster 16.

434
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,590
Rym: See I went out.

435
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:33,990
Scott: Perfect run-of-the-mill ISA car.

436
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:43,852
Rym: I convinced my parents and I went out and I bought Physically for quite a bit of money a sound blaster awe which stands for advanced wave effects 32.

437
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:52,382
Scott: Yeah It wasn't until I got my penny m3 450 that I bought a sound blaster live Value because I didn't need the non value and it was a lot of money.

438
00:35:52,402 --> 00:36:04,764
Rym: Yeah, I bought the live way way later I got the Platinum for various reasons, but the author t2 was one of those few light not life-changing But one of those moments in computing were a whole bunch of computer knowledge.

439
00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:06,168
Rym: suddenly all clicked together.

440
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:15,270
Rym: for me like I remember the exact moment because I had the game tie fighter and I had this fort 16 sound card and Tie fighter was great, but the music really sucked.

441
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:20,310
Rym: It just sounded like crap and the sound effects like if more than a few sounds are playing at the same time.

442
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,887
Rym: It just broke and it didn't work.

443
00:36:22,772 --> 00:36:28,809
Rym: So I install this all 32 and after a few hours I get it working and I get and then eventually I decide to play tie fighter.

444
00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:34,570
Rym: So I run the setup and I set it up separately because the all 32 acted like two different sound cards.

445
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:47,969
Rym: So I told the game that used the Sound Blaster 16 in that sound card for the sound and used the all 32 which I wasn't sure what that stood for what it did or the music and The music in tie fighter was just MIDI.

446
00:36:48,772 --> 00:37:06,270
Rym: So then I started up the game and instead of hearing the tinny crappy You know Star Wars theme I heard the Star Wars theme and then I realized What MIDI really was and why it sounded different and suddenly this whole world of music clicked before me.

447
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,235
Scott: You see I didn't realize.

448
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:14,851
Scott: see when I had that sound blaster 16 I had a lot of MIDI's and pretty much in those days people made MIDI's out of sound blaster 16.

449
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:17,110
Scott: So they sounded the same because everyone had the same card.

450
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:24,089
Rym: Yeah, if anyone is old enough, you might remember Vikram's MIDI repository, which is pretty much the biggest MIDI site ever Yep.

451
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:34,646
Scott: And then I took those MIDI's onto my new computer and I played them and they they it sounded like the computer Was trying to make them sound better, but they ended up not sounding the way I remember them.

452
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:38,726
Scott: So I was kind of unhappy Yeah, and then I realized what was going on.

453
00:37:38,746 --> 00:37:43,250
Rym: much later I remember playing around with sound fonts and trying to make my own instruments.

454
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:48,230
Scott: Yeah, sound fonts basically let you change what instruments are in your sound card.

455
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:55,190
Scott: So when if a program tries to play the synthesizer in your sound card with MIDI you can choose, you know.

456
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,325
Scott: Oh don't use that guitar use this guitar or don't use those drums.

457
00:37:58,385 --> 00:38:01,039
Scott: use this set of drums And then you can make it sound different.

458
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:07,170
Rym: Yep, because this was days before mp3 So I collected a lot of MIDI files and I also had a really nice digital piano.

459
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:09,490
Rym: So what we and I still have that piano to this day.

460
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:25,856
Rym: my parents got it for me way way back but what I'd often do when I was in the computer room doing stuff is I'd Plug the MIDI into the piano and I'd play piano MIDI files Which basically meant that I had a player piano that would play anything I could find on the internet perfectly like a real piano Mm-hmm, and it was great.

461
00:38:25,876 --> 00:38:28,369
Rym: That was what I listened to because there were no mp3s back then.

462
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:30,423
Rym: That was the kind of music you listen to on a computer.

463
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:31,007
Rym: Mm-hmm.

464
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:34,441
Rym: Of course, I also had the problem of all these sound cards.

465
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:43,670
Rym: We've talked about until the sound blaster live were ISA Which means it plugged into the big black slot that probably doesn't exist on any of your computers.

466
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:45,310
Scott: No, it probably doesn't now.

467
00:38:45,430 --> 00:39:03,686
Rym: I also had an ISA network card for my cable modem way way back which meant that Whenever I was on the internet and I was downloading anything pretty much every packet that came in Would make the sound skip a little bit So I'd pause my music whenever I was downloading something.

468
00:39:03,706 --> 00:39:06,139
Scott: Wow That's crazy.

469
00:39:06,523 --> 00:39:15,209
Rym: Yeah Then one day I because I didn't even realize I had an ISA network card because the the cable guy came and he put the network card in our computer.

470
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:22,249
Rym: Because they actually gave everyone who signed up for this like trial cable modem a network card because no one had him back then.

471
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:25,200
Rym: And then one day I knew where all my computers I look in.

472
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,069
Rym: it was an ISA card like what the fuck.

473
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:30,127
Rym: and I went Out and bought a PCI network card for like 60 bucks.

474
00:39:31,012 --> 00:39:34,470
Scott: Well, they probably bought around ISA cards because very few people had PCI in those days.

475
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,964
Rym: I had two slots and one of them was empty and that bastard didn't put it in there.

476
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:40,966
Scott: Yeah, I remember that It's six ISA.

477
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:45,001
Scott: That was the time when my 46 couldn't keep up with games anymore.

478
00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:45,923
Scott: was I bought?

479
00:39:46,304 --> 00:39:53,710
Scott: I wanted to play Jedi Knight one And it said requirement, you know PCI video card and I didn't have one of those.

480
00:39:53,891 --> 00:40:04,810
Scott: I had an onboard one megabyte serious logic video card Which couldn't do much more than you know doom and doom 2 and all that but it did those hella well as for sure.

481
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:09,547
Rym: Yeah, I said my like graphics blaster extreme from creative.

482
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:18,350
Scott: Yeah So anyway the sound cards nowadays, uh We have two magic things that make sound cards work really nicely and all the same.

483
00:40:18,972 --> 00:40:31,290
Scott: One of those magic things is called direct X and if you're on Linux also, and if you're on OS X I don't know what the hell they call it, but it's there and It's probably it's one of the few things that Microsoft has done, right?

484
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:31,670
Rym: Yeah,

485
00:40:32,152 --> 00:40:53,246
Scott: what DirectX does if you don't understand it already and specifically in this case direct sound but all of DirectX is is the same basic thing is Remember how we said in the olden days if you're running a DOS game you to tell it which sound card you had and the Game had to include a different code for playing sound based on which sound card you had.

486
00:40:53,527 --> 00:41:03,330
Scott: and you know This got troublesome because like I said everyone just ended up making all the sound cards the same Which really hindered development of new sound card technologies?

487
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:17,406
Rym: Yeah, cuz you can put a lot of awesome stuff in a sound card like just effects or noise cleanup stuff But if the software didn't use any of that you either had to put all of that logic in the hardware and does make it Difficult to change or break the standard.

488
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:24,186
Scott: Yep So and no one was gonna write You know code for your specific sound card into their game.

489
00:41:24,206 --> 00:41:26,578
Scott: if you know You didn't pay them a lot of money.

490
00:41:26,638 --> 00:41:30,685
Scott: and if no one had your sound card, you know It's not if it's not gonna sell them more copies of the game.

491
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:31,289
Scott: What do they care?

492
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:48,229
Scott: So DirectX what it does is it means that only DirectX has to know about all the different sound cards in the world, you know DirectX, you know Microsoft and whoever makes drivers and support for every different sound card in the entire universe.

493
00:41:48,249 --> 00:41:54,556
Scott: and Then when you write a game and you want to put sound in that game You don't care what sound card they have.

494
00:41:54,616 --> 00:41:56,981
Scott: you just write code for direct sound.

495
00:41:57,302 --> 00:42:05,550
Scott: you say play these sounds direct sound and then Direct-sound figures out what kind of sound card you have and plays the sounds at the best of its ability.

496
00:42:06,174 --> 00:42:21,085
Scott: So if you're writing any sort of software now you just program the sound the way you want and you don't have to worry about which sound cart which sound card or What video card or what network card the computer that the game player happens to have.

497
00:42:21,947 --> 00:42:23,070
Scott: and that's what that's all about.

498
00:42:23,913 --> 00:42:28,230
Rym: Yeah now if you weren't that interested in this episode, I'll be perfectly honest that it was a cop-out.

499
00:42:28,472 --> 00:42:37,393
Rym: We came up with a bunch of good ideas for future Mondays But they all required a little bit of research a little bit of effort or a little bit of anything that we weren't willing to Put forth today.

500
00:42:37,674 --> 00:42:37,835
Scott: Yeah.

501
00:42:38,076 --> 00:42:41,691
Scott: Oh the last thing I'll talk about it very briefly is AC 97.

502
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:44,283
Scott: You'll see a lot of people talking about AC 97.

503
00:42:44,283 --> 00:42:45,729
Scott: You'll see it on sound cards and stuff.

504
00:42:46,394 --> 00:42:48,770
Scott: That's just a way of talking to sound card.

505
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:59,790
Scott: That is a standard that Intel came up with in 1997 and it basically allows You know the CPU to send a lot of PCM's to the sound card, which is all people do these days.

506
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,979
Rym: I'll bet that no one cared about that last bit.

507
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:02,661
Rym: You just add it in.

508
00:43:02,842 --> 00:43:06,819
Rym: Yeah, I just wanted it cuz I You don't you know why you put that in.

509
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,269
Rym: you put that in because you looked it up a little while ago.

510
00:43:09,952 --> 00:43:15,330
Scott: Also, well, it's because I keep seeing AC 97 and like every sound card and I always wondered what the hell it was.

511
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,529
Scott: So now anyone else who's wondering what the hell that was now, you know, you know what I'm asking my listeners out here.

512
00:43:21,012 --> 00:43:22,970
Rym: Do any of you not know what that wasn't care?

513
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:24,753
Rym: I'm curious.

514
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,586
Scott: I bet at least one person didn't know what AC 97 was.

515
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:28,410
Scott: and now they're going.

516
00:43:28,831 --> 00:43:34,070
Rym: Oh, it's it's something that yeah, but I'm asking you to look deep in your heart and wonder if you really cared.

517
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,340
Scott: Did you really care about anything in this episode?

518
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,429
Rym: Yeah, this episode was a total cop-out.

519
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,477
Rym: Don't worry the rest of the week will be awesome.

520
00:43:41,497 --> 00:43:43,284
Rym: We've actually got really good topics lined up.

521
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:43,746
Rym: Yeah.

522
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:44,087
Scott: All right.

523
00:43:44,127 --> 00:43:48,222
Scott: Come on people We're having a little bit of difficulty coming up with Monday.

524
00:43:48,282 --> 00:43:48,945
Scott: I know we're not.

525
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:49,990
Rym: we have plenty of money ideas.

526
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:53,850
Rym: The problem is every time Monday comes around we're exhausted from the week exactly.

527
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,607
Scott: We need Monday ideas that don't require research effort or preparation.

528
00:43:57,828 --> 00:43:58,270
Rym: Oh great.

529
00:43:58,531 --> 00:44:09,870
Scott: So if you know have any Monday show ideas technology science sci-fi aside from the hundreds that have already been put in the forum They're actually I look through and there weren't that many Monday ones in there.

530
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,581
Scott: There are mostly Thursday ones and a lot of them we did already.

531
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:17,894
Rym: it was you know, and anyway, we didn't do security We didn't do networking.

532
00:44:18,476 --> 00:44:20,242
Rym: Yeah, we didn't do voting machines.

533
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:22,310
Scott: Let's we got to work up to that, you know.

534
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:24,202
Rym: No, we don't you just have to not be tired.

535
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:25,349
Scott: Yeah, that's never gonna happen.

536
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:32,170
Rym: I might happen next weekend because all we got is that metal concert and that Jewish holiday.

537
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:36,850
Scott: Well, no, you have the Jewish holiday and the rest of us day is like spirited beacon day.

538
00:44:37,392 --> 00:44:39,300
Rym: Oh, yeah, we'll take Pete and Jess out to that.

539
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:40,928
Rym: Yeah, there's some hijinks.

540
00:44:41,189 --> 00:44:48,010
Rym: Yep Anyway look forward to the rest of hockey fight week and look forward to us not being quite so tired tomorrow.

541
00:44:48,593 --> 00:44:50,807
Scott: Alright tomorrow be tucked like a pirate day.

542
00:44:50,827 --> 00:45:01,698
Rym: Yeah And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

543
00:45:01,718 --> 00:45:03,824
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for our opening theme.

544
00:45:04,225 --> 00:45:08,659
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

545
00:45:09,281 --> 00:45:11,630
Scott: if you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

Scott: You can send your email feedback to GeekNights at gmail.com and if you want you can leave us a voicemail at 206.

548
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:26,670
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight Monday through Thursday.

549
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:32,846
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience, but unlike those other talk shows.

550
00:45:33,227 --> 00:45:34,490
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
