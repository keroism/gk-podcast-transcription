1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,137
Rym: It's Thursday January 17th.

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,040
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,210
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is eat nice jinx personal.

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,450
Rym: Tonight we take dibs on shotgun.

5
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:24,798
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:31,958
Rym: So last night I had to engage in one of those semi-annual tasks.

7
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:36,200
Rym: that is Not so much something I want to do, but something that must be done.

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,000
Rym: You know insert innuendo here.

9
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:43,797
Rym: a man has a duty and every now and then you have to stand up and do your duty to the world.

10
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:52,780
Rym: and last night I Being the designated drain Oh doer had to buy that scary-ass shit and pour it down the drain while Scott watched from afar.

11
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:56,457
Scott: It was kind of interesting because it was like it used to be liquid, but now it's gel.

12
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:57,602
Scott: well No, no there.

13
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:58,506
Rym: You can still get the liquid.

14
00:00:58,526 --> 00:00:59,289
Rym: There's three kinds.

15
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:01,779
Scott: There's the normal three one two three times.

16
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:10,479
Rym: There's the normal liquid which is like standard Drano and by Drano I mean generically everything takes that trademark acid in a in a jug.

17
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:12,937
Rym: no It's the opposite of acid the base in a jug.

18
00:01:12,997 --> 00:01:14,497
Scott: yes alkaline.

19
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,400
Rym: So there's the liquid one which is like that the standard weak sauce.

20
00:01:18,923 --> 00:01:21,135
Rym: And then there's the gel which is weak sauce.

21
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:25,760
Rym: still if you touch it They'll hardly burn you, but then then there's the gel which is all right.

22
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,671
Rym: I'm going down there, and I'm cleaning that out the gel.

23
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:35,780
Scott: I realized it's probably just as powerful But because it goes down slowly it actually sits there for longer burning more.

24
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:44,439
Rym: And then there's the foamer the one I use usually which is too dangerous chemicals that when you mix them together In the drain it goes foam foam foam foam foam foam foam foam foam foam foam.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,180
Scott: I actually feel safer with that one because if you only one of them spills It's a little it's a I guess more.

26
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:54,880
Rym: Okay, what I think you would have to put forth quite a bit of effort to only spill one of them.

27
00:01:55,082 --> 00:02:00,540
Rym: Yeah, I know plus It's scary because if the drain is really clogged and you put it down there it could just comes right back up.

28
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:04,894
Rym: And now I'm standing there, and there's there's Evil just sitting there all over it.

29
00:02:04,914 --> 00:02:05,620
Rym: I'm like what do I do now?

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,879
Scott: It's very strange that I'm so afraid of that stuff right, but like in school in the chemistry lab I just feel like yeah boiling hydrochloric acid sure whatever.

31
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:21,280
Rym: Well there was Krenzle in my high school who we were told in the chemistry lab we had some Concentrated hydrochloric acid in a thing in a fume hood.

32
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,162
Rym: We're doing something with it And he's like.

33
00:02:23,182 --> 00:02:32,370
Rym: now everyone make sure you don't get your head in the fume hood because hydrochloric acid will make you pass out pretty much immediately if you inhale it and Craig goes really, and then he passes out.

34
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:38,650
Rym: yep, yeah, but uh so Emily and Scott are been pretty much most sane.

35
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,325
Rym: human beings don't like to be around Drano And it's kind of a scary thing.

36
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:44,532
Scott: and for that tub it was backed up.

37
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:46,880
Rym: for whatever reason it is my duty.

38
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,899
Rym: I'm the one who has to do this every time it happens.

39
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:52,280
Scott: I would probably do it if you weren't here, and it needs to be done.

40
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,055
Rym: But I was here and we could have been not gonna do it.

41
00:02:55,095 --> 00:03:00,947
Scott: if I'm not gonna do it It needed to be done for like a week and a half Basically that morning yesterday morning.

42
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,194
Scott: I took a foot bath when I was taking a shower.

43
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:04,940
Scott: Yeah an unwanted foot bath.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,372
Rym: I don't like a nasty soapy dirty water Show me that.

45
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:16,100
Scott: but this morning I had to like spray my water feet spray my feet with water because they were so dry because the drain was flowing so nicely.

46
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:23,898
Rym: Yeah, Drano is some scary stuff, but it's my duty as a man, and I will continue to do it until the day I die hopefully not from Drano.

47
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:27,400
Rym: Thing is I never keep Drano in the house.

48
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:30,100
Rym: I always buy it and then use it right away, and then it's gone.

49
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:33,920
Scott: Yeah, that's definitely because the way to go I always remember as a kid too Cuz.

50
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:41,380
Rym: I think the only reason I'm not so afraid of is that as a kid my mom always made me do it So I kind of built up a mental immunity.

51
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:44,880
Rym: But even then I always was afraid like what if I'm doing dishes?

52
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:47,338
Rym: And I just grabbed the Drano by mistake and fart in the sink.

53
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:49,926
Rym: Oh Luckily you can't cuz.

54
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:51,938
Rym: those Drano bottles are also scary looking.

55
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:56,294
Scott: yeah Well kids is here's a lesson that you everyone should know right now.

56
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:58,160
Scott: scary like don't use it in the toilet.

57
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:01,036
Rym: You know it says don't use in the toilet, and they're not kidding.

58
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:02,524
Rym: Yeah They're not hitting.

59
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:06,882
Scott: I you know I was so afraid of it that I was never in a position to make that mistake But I won.

60
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,808
Scott: I could have made that mistake quite easily.

61
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,558
Rym: It's kind of like mixing ammonia and bleach.

62
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,120
Rym: Don't do it.

63
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,346
Rym: Don't even bother ice can.

64
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,130
Rym: why just don't do it?

65
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:15,035
Rym: you might die.

66
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,286
Rym: a lot of old ladies Die of that or at least used to.

67
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:18,271
Scott: don't do that.

68
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:18,653
Scott: Well.

69
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:19,718
Scott: They all they all died already.

70
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:22,958
Scott: You have a news over there.

71
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,172
Rym: I kind of do kind of this.

72
00:04:25,272 --> 00:04:38,660
Rym: I could have talked about this on Monday But I'm gonna go from the more human side instead of the technology side even though the technology here is really cool And I think we're gonna see a lot of this cyborg ization and such in the future great in our lifetime.

73
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:48,089
Rym: But the gist of the story is that there is a man Oscar Pistorius a world-class sprinter And he wanted to compete in the Olympics.

74
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:48,691
Rym: hmm.

75
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:49,735
Rym: There's one problem.

76
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:54,573
Rym: He has no legs Unlike coconut monkey at least has arms, but he has no legs.

77
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:55,115
Scott: well.

78
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:56,240
Scott: Did he ever have legs?

79
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:59,954
Scott: I assumed so it was he a world-class spinner when he had the legs.

80
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,260
Rym: I don't he's a double amputee.

81
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,725
Rym: I didn't read the whole story.

82
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:03,808
Rym: the deal is though.

83
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:09,080
Rym: He has artificial legs, so they decided all right well Maybe we'll let you compete in the Olympics.

84
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:16,434
Rym: And then they decided after doing some testing that no because you're using artificial legs You are not allowed to compete in the Olympics.

85
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:29,400
Rym: now the reason Why the specific reason was not that it's dangerous or that it's unfair because he'd lose or it's because his artificial Legs are so much better than real legs for running.

86
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:33,920
Rym: He is faster and better than any human could ever be with these artificial legs.

87
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,727
Scott: Well what it was is that they measured.

88
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:43,482
Scott: you know in many trials that he could expend less energy To go just as fast as normal people you know or other sprinters You know.

89
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:50,018
Scott: so he could actually run as fast as the other people But it would be easier for him to do it than it be them for them to do the same speed.

90
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:53,974
Rym: now I recommend you check out this article just to see a picture of the artificial legs.

91
00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:55,059
Rym: They're really cool.

92
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,800
Rym: Yeah They're pretty cool, and I don't know I have a lot to say about this.

93
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:14,780
Rym: I mean on one hand I always knew this day would come and I'm sure it will be coming more and more in the future Because we saw this even not in earlier times where Pitchers in baseball There's a common injury you can get if you're a pitcher in baseball and there's a surgery that fixes it.

94
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,044
Rym: I forget all the details so correct me if I'm wrong But I pretty much.

95
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:27,320
Rym: the deal is if you get this injury you can like pull this tendon back And then sew it down somewhere and it fixes it But as a result it also makes you a lot stronger for pitching.

96
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:33,900
Rym: So there were debates about is it okay if a pitcher just gets that surgery and they're perfectly fine?

97
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:37,940
Rym: Or what if they pitch badly to try and get the injury just so they can get the surgery?

98
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:46,833
Rym: yeah, and we're getting to the point now where there are prosthetics and Replacement parts for human bodies that are arguably better.

99
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:48,580
Scott: well better for some uses.

100
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,266
Scott: I'm sure his legs are not.

101
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:52,033
Scott: those legs are made for running.

102
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:53,016
Scott: I'm sure he has different leg.

103
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:54,080
Rym: shoes are made for walking.

104
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,140
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure he has different legs for walking around and you know his life is not as easy.

105
00:06:59,064 --> 00:06:59,707
Rym: See that's the thing.

106
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:02,460
Rym: I am sure that he would much rather have legs.

107
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,832
Scott: I'm also, but you know that you can makes.

108
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:12,182
Scott: you know we don't we're not at the point yet We can make a body part that is superior in all ways to the body parts We currently have.

109
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:26,919
Scott: but at the same time because the world we've made is a world that is designed for you know Human parts if we could redesign the whole world to make it more convenient for like you know Wheelchairs then all of a sudden people without wheelchairs would actually have a hard time.

110
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:34,220
Rym: Well, I think it's also just the fact that the technology is not there yet to make something that is overall completely a hundred percent better.

111
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:38,600
Rym: That the thing is though that is going to happen in our lifetimes.

112
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:55,973
Rym: There's very little doubt in my mind that we're going to see a point in our lives where there will be maybe an artificial eye Or an artificial ear an artificial hand that is better in every possible way Than what a human being naturally could achieve and at that point.

113
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:57,316
Rym: I don't know.

114
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:58,560
Rym: I find that really interesting.

115
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:05,711
Rym: I mean on one hand Definitely this is great for people who are injured But there are going to be people who will want to upgrade.

116
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:07,276
Rym: not kind of like with vision.

117
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:08,400
Rym: you can do this with glasses now.

118
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,371
Rym: You can get glasses if you have bad vision.

119
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:11,356
Rym: they give you 20/20 vision.

120
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:16,437
Rym: You can also if you want get glasses that give you 2010 vision.

121
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:18,344
Rym: I in fact did that.

122
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:18,645
Rym: I get.

123
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:21,957
Rym: my glasses now actually give me better than normal vision.

124
00:08:21,997 --> 00:08:22,940
Rym: I paid extra for that.

125
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,063
Rym: It's an option you can do.

126
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:29,660
Rym: there are people with perfectly good vision who buy fancy designer glasses that let them see better.

127
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,447
Scott: Well night vision goggles.

128
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:35,960
Rym: Yeah, but I think I don't know.

129
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:45,181
Rym: I feel like a lot of people are gonna be very resistant to the idea of someone cutting off their hand and getting a better devil hand Luke Skywalker or Fry?

130
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:50,560
Scott: yeah, I think the real issue here as it relates to sports right is that that's the other half of this conversation.

131
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:52,420
Scott: Is that a sport is a game?

132
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,239
Scott: It's a competition right and the you know the steroids falls into this too.

133
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:06,908
Scott: They sort of haven't answered the fundamental question, which is we have a competition you're testing something you're testing You know especially a versus competition like sprinting right.

134
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:11,360
Scott: and the question is that they haven't answered is what are you testing right?

135
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:22,893
Scott: and you know if you're testing you know the ability of you know a Unmodified human body to propel itself with its legs and you're you want it.

136
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:24,137
Scott: you and faster is better.

137
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:32,959
Scott: well like then Someone who doesn't have an unmodified human body can't really enter that competition, but if the competition is you know?

138
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,320
Scott: Any human body how fast can you make it move by any means possible?

139
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,626
Scott: Rockets and whatnot.

140
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:42,111
Rym: is the way like look at f1.

141
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:42,714
Rym: people think like.

142
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:44,380
Rym: people think car racing is just car racing.

143
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:51,090
Rym: but look at the difference between like Le Mans or F1 or kart racing and like f1 for example.

144
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,654
Rym: you think oh, it's testing driver skill.

145
00:09:53,035 --> 00:09:55,040
Rym: well driver skill is one part of it.

146
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,540
Rym: But the other part of it is they're testing car technology within a certain set of constraints.

147
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,100
Rym: Yeah, if they wanted to test just drivers there, and they would give everyone the exact same car.

148
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:18,680
Scott: Yeah, not only that but they're testing car technology and driver skill for driving incredibly fast on a complicated route repeatedly over Like an hour or so of time as opposed to Le Mans which is an endurance race.

149
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,965
Scott: They're testing not how.

150
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:23,297
Scott: also they're testing how fast but also how long can you drive?

151
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:24,000
Rym: or NASCAR?

152
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,712
Rym: Which is testing largely driver strategy and that sort of thing.

153
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:31,120
Rym: yeah, there's there's and in in sports I don't know.

154
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,173
Rym: I feel like there are two directions to go with sports in the future.

155
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:40,780
Rym: and the thing is it's easy to make delineations now because all right you can tell if someone has become a cyborg or not.

156
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:43,730
Rym: It's obvious that someone has a cyborg body part.

157
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:44,854
Rym: What are we gonna?

158
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,400
Rym: Do when these things are organic?

159
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:46,899
Rym: What are we gonna?

160
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,336
Rym: Do when you can just cut off your leg and replace it with a vat grown leg?

161
00:10:51,376 --> 00:10:52,219
Rym: that is just better.

162
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:54,476
Scott: I mean you know I don't really.

163
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:56,265
Scott: you know I don't have a problem with.

164
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:59,920
Scott: if you know sports go this way or sports go that way really doesn't matter to me.

165
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:12,899
Scott: But if in any game you really have to define the rules And you know what if you whatever the rules are defined as that's what it is And if it turns out that people like a sport better with different rules, then the rules will change.

166
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,485
Rym: well You know what I think I think in the long run.

167
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:15,207
Rym: What's going to happen.

168
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:21,240
Rym: Is that their sports in terms of athleticism I think are eventually going to disappear?

169
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:34,700
Rym: And I think that what will happen is because if human bodies and the way we interact with the world becomes so mutable Then games will no longer be games of physical prowess on such a direct low level because that's not interesting anymore.

170
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:40,340
Rym: You want someone to run faster you make a running guy you want someone to throw a javelin you make a guy with one?

171
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:48,940
Scott: Really really really big, but maybe maybe as an f1 Whereas there is the mechanical component of who can make the fastest car it'll become who can make the fastest run.

172
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,786
Rym: Well, that's what I'm saying.

173
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:59,080
Rym: I think what's going to happen is we're going to see Competitions that are purely technical or purely you know looking at the aspect of what can we do within the constraints of the physical world?

174
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,623
Rym: And kind of like f1.

175
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:01,164
Rym: we're all right.

176
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:03,472
Rym: here are the constraints of this competition.

177
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:06,644
Rym: you can build a cyborg as long as you don't Break any of these rules.

178
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:07,408
Rym: go nuts.

179
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:10,722
Rym: and I think in terms of sports We will.

180
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:17,500
Rym: I think all sports are eventually going to become games entirely of skill and strategy and not at all of athleticism.

181
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:21,310
Rym: Yeah, I think that is the because I mean look at how many sports.

182
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,292
Rym: we've talked about this before.

183
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:35,972
Rym: but like baseball the strategy of baseball Has become so perfected that the who wins and loses comes down to such minute factors as in this guy is 1% stronger because he trained 1% more and as a result.

184
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:38,260
Rym: It's 1% more home runs or the wind.

185
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:45,137
Rym: Yes, and at that point I feel like games with more strategy and at like skill and talent involved.

186
00:12:45,177 --> 00:12:48,611
Rym: like hockey though hockey Eventually, we'll have this problem to all game hockey.

187
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:49,957
Scott: I think we'll have the problem last.

188
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:52,560
Scott: well No football will also last a very long time.

189
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,192
Rym: Yes, because football is not completely exhausted.

190
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,860
Rym: and also they change the rules of football.

191
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,547
Scott: Yeah, they change them all the time you get.

192
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:01,660
Scott: every time football turns the referees don't even know all the rules of football.

193
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,440
Scott: Yeah, I could link you to some football rules, and we're not talking about soccer.

194
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:09,500
Scott: Sorry Europeans and other people not we're talking about a real sport.

195
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:16,560
Scott: I actually I can send you some rules from the NFL official rule book that you could not understand what they are.

196
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,266
Rym: dude I've been to football games for half the time.

197
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:21,559
Rym: something weird happens and the whole audience crowd is like what's going on?

198
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,897
Rym: I mean football is the only sport where the ref will come out and everyone gets quiet.

199
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:33,771
Rym: the ref says The rule was blah blah happened therefore Blah that doesn't happen in hockey.

200
00:13:33,992 --> 00:13:40,159
Rym: in hockey something happens And then the ref scope mumble mumble mumble mumble and then the game just continues and someone's sitting in a box.

201
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:43,979
Scott: I know most of those crazy football rules, but not all of them.

202
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:47,867
Scott: It's really yeah, that's.

203
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:50,800
Scott: part of what makes football entertaining though is when crazy stuff happens like that.

204
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:58,160
Rym: You know I I've noticed that in any sport whenever something crazy happens It always seems like that makes it a lot more fun like hot.

205
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:02,352
Rym: Whenever a crazy fight breaks out that game is ten times more memorable.

206
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:04,980
Scott: Oh, yeah, all right, so my news here, right?

207
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,604
Scott: What do you got?

208
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:07,018
Scott: they did this scientific study?

209
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,665
Scott: Science involving neurology's.

210
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:10,527
Scott: you like those neurology.

211
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:11,349
Scott: I like fusiform.

212
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,533
Rym: Gyri all right.

213
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:13,676
Scott: Here's what they did.

214
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:14,839
Scott: is that they did here.

215
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,999
Scott: They took some wine.

216
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:18,224
Scott: You like wine right?

217
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:20,373
Rym: I do in fact like wine.

218
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:23,105
Rym: I could go on I could do a show about wine But I don't think you want.

219
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:25,920
Scott: they had a whole bunch of the wine and the wine was all the same.

220
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,638
Rym: Joke about whining instead.

221
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,320
Scott: Anyway, they had a whole bunch of wine.

222
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:40,780
Scott: It was all the same one and they put it in bottles and some of the bottles were $10 wine and some were $90 wine, but it's all the same wine.

223
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,547
Rym: I just see what they did there.

224
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:45,620
Rym: just different bottles right kind of like on Penn and Teller's bullshit.

225
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,987
Rym: But they had the hose water.

226
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:51,185
Scott: yep exactly, but this is a study and not just Dote hose wine.

227
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:56,096
Scott: yeah, so they had hosed dad all this normal wine And I don't know if it was good or bad or what I?

228
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,543
Scott: Imagine they must have redone the study with different wines because they're the professionals not me right and They had some of it.

229
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,748
Scott: was you know some of it.

230
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:05,856
Scott: people drank thinking it was cheap and some of it.

231
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:07,849
Scott: people drank thinking it was fancy right.

232
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:10,658
Scott: and What they did is they?

233
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:15,400
Scott: They like scan people's brains like for pleasure or something like that.

234
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,880
Scott: I don't know the details of that But I guess it was a percent signal charge in the mo FC is what they were looking at the mosque.

235
00:15:22,282 --> 00:15:25,460
Rym: Yeah, it's my favorite part of the brain other than the fusiform gyrus yep.

236
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:28,874
Scott: And they have a little graph here, and there's a whole article that you can read.

237
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:30,521
Scott: and the little graph I don't know.

238
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:44,226
Scott: I like the hippocampus to write the little graph has has the x the y axis is the Percent signal change in the mo FC and the x-axis is time right and there's a little arrow and the arrow points to zero on the time track.

239
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:49,080
Rym: you know I'm just picturing a Completely made-up graph that doesn't say anything.

240
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:52,651
Scott: It's a son, but but the point at the graph here.

241
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:57,419
Scott: I'll read the the zero the God the zero on the graph.

242
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,209
Rym: What is the study find?

243
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:00,355
Scott: basically that?

244
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:11,237
Scott: You if you think the what if the wine is more expensive even before you drink it your pleasure will start going up and then after you drink it will go up even more.

245
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:18,040
Rym: and If now did it did that correlate with self-assessment of enjoyment and self-assessment of the wine itself?

246
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:24,624
Scott: Or was it just noted in the brain that the graph here is with Brain X?

247
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:27,733
Rym: so just the break because I'm curious because I can think of one explanation.

248
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:29,016
Scott: that isn't I know.

249
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:33,935
Scott: here's the second graph Which is the the ranking which which people said was better.

250
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:34,959
Rym: Do they coincide?

251
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:35,019
Rym: uh?

252
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,460
Scott: Pretty much yeah people said the more expensive ones were better.

253
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,623
Rym: Well, it's like that Dilbert.

254
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:41,589
Rym: the more expensive shoes are clearly superior.

255
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:51,203
Scott: the chart shows that people rank taste of a $45 wine higher than The same wine priced at five dollars and the same for a different wine marked at 90 and 10.

256
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:52,413
Scott: So I guess they had two wines.

257
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:56,412
Scott: one of them was $45 and five and the other one was 90 and 10. the got.

258
00:16:56,433 --> 00:17:03,460
Scott: the original graph that I sucked at explaining Says this the text on that says this graph shows the activity in the brains pleasure center.

259
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,938
Scott: There's more activity with wine subjects think cost $90 a bottle than the same wine priced at $10.

260
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:21,048
Rym: well I remember two similar studies one where they took McDonald's wrappers and McDonald's logos and put them on food or didn't put them on food and Children ranked McDonald's branded food.

261
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:24,400
Rym: that was identical much much higher in terms of taste and quality.

262
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:37,698
Rym: and there was that beer study where they took a bunch of beer drinkers and they did you know a Double blind beer test and they found that most people couldn't tell it all and in fact often preferred beer that they had added vinegar To as part of the test.

263
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:46,899
Scott: Yeah, but basically I think this this this is from let's see Caltech Stanford great Yeah, so smart places is from.

264
00:17:48,322 --> 00:18:08,120
Scott: I've suspected for a long time and there's been evidence but now I think there's a preponderance of evidence that suggests that the amount that people say they like something or You know do it in fact like something the amount of pleasure people get from something is Not entirely just based on the qualities the inherent qualities of that something.

265
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:15,160
Rym: It's just that the human brain is complex and all these sorts of factors even subconsciously can affect the way you perceive the world.

266
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,886
Rym: I mean look at the placebo effect.

267
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:20,660
Rym: You can if you believe that something will alleviate pain.

268
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:25,597
Rym: Oftentimes you will feel as though you experience less pain, even though nothing has changed.

269
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:36,928
Scott: Yep, and yeah, so I Do think though that you know the professional wine tasty people the real Professional wine tasty people not the people pretending.

270
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:40,320
Scott: but you know, they drink wines that are all just labeled ABCDEFG.

271
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,309
Scott: They don't know which ones are which or how much they cost.

272
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:49,300
Scott: So that's that's still a fair test there, but You know next time, you know, you see someone driving a BMW you're talking about how great it is.

273
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,296
Scott: Well, maybe if it was the same exact car, but it said like POS on it.

274
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:55,420
Scott: They wouldn't like it as much.

275
00:18:56,244 --> 00:19:04,776
Rym: but by the same token if I was driving a Horizon, let's say a Plymouth horizon, but it had a Ferrari logo on it and I paid $100,000 for it.

276
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:07,391
Rym: I'm probably not gonna have a good time.

277
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,580
Rym: No, probably not You know.

278
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:15,013
Rym: I think what really rings true in the end is just Eat what tastes good to you and drink what tastes good to you.

279
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,706
Rym: and if you like the $5 wine Buy the $5 wine.

280
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:22,958
Rym: if you want to impress your friends say it was a $40 wine.

281
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:23,499
Rym: They don't know.

282
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:36,698
Scott: I think the real goal here is to just the to avoid marketing and avoid You know sort of like, you know getting preconceived notions of what if things are gonna be good or bad before.

283
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:42,416
Rym: the same time Get preconceived notions that things are expensive and good and then things will taste better to you.

284
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:43,560
Rym: if your brain is messing with you.

285
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:44,984
Scott: Yeah, I mean it.

286
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:50,900
Scott: just just have really high expectations of really cheap stuff and sudden maybe that's how Scott Johnson watches all those.

287
00:19:52,763 --> 00:20:00,170
Rym: No, I think it's purely the dollar to unit fund ratio there because sure it may be a crappy anime But he only paid a dollar for it.

288
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:04,449
Rym: I know right Plus that's also the man who showed us cowboy bebop.

289
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:05,192
Scott: Yeah.

290
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:14,099
Scott: Yeah, but hey the point is is that Yeah Expectations have a great effect on actual perceived pleasure in the end.

291
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,918
Rym: Anyway things of the day.

292
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:26,010
Rym: So what do you got for me Scott on this here Thursday thing of the day?

293
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:32,388
Scott: Well, there's a. you know, if a cartoon was made in 1938 that cartoon is in the public domain.

294
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,012
Rym: Uh, Yes, it is.

295
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:34,293
Rym: Yep.

296
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:36,158
Scott: So here is a cartoon.

297
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:37,562
Scott: I think it is a merry melody.

298
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:49,888
Scott: if I if I man it's on YouTube I don't know how long it'll say on YouTube because you know while it is Public domain that you know YouTube and someone might complain and then you know without even asking questions.

299
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:52,055
Scott: They take it off Whatever, but it is.

300
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:57,510
Scott: this is like the highest quality YouTube video I've ever seen and it's a. it's called catnip College.

301
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:59,338
Scott: You can't go wrong watching a merry melody.

302
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:03,254
Scott: I haven't watched it yet, and I don't think I've ever seen it But it doesn't freaking matter.

303
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:06,950
Rym: Is it better or worse than I like to sing it in the moon?

304
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,084
Scott: I don't think it's as good as that one.

305
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:09,870
Scott: That's the best one.

306
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:15,783
Scott: Nothing beats that one but This one it can't be bad.

307
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:16,831
Scott: It's a merry melody I don't know.

308
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:24,020
Rym: I'm highly partial to the old Bugs Bunny versus that opera singer even though as a kid I loved it and then as an adult I saw it again.

309
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,290
Rym: All I could think was wow Bugs Bunny's an asshole.

310
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:27,054
Rym: Yeah, he is.

311
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:28,301
Scott: That's why I didn't deserve that.

312
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:33,283
Rym: That's why he's so great And Daffy Duck needed to be committed.

313
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:33,806
Rym: God damn.

314
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:34,350
Scott: Yeah he did.

315
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,150
Scott: What was your favorite?

316
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:40,482
Scott: We could do the show on Looney Tunes instead.

317
00:21:40,502 --> 00:21:41,247
Scott: We could just cut it.

318
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:44,130
Rym: right now We'll save that one cuz I'd have to watch a bunch again.

319
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:44,590
Rym: That's true.

320
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,870
Rym: And also it's tough because I like a lot of Looney Tunes but at the same time the old Donald Duck versus Chip and Dale.

321
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,013
Rym: Okay My favorite cartoons ever.

322
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:56,727
Scott: You have to pick a single or old Warner Brothers cartoon a single one.

323
00:21:56,847 --> 00:22:00,439
Scott: not not a character But like a single one, which one do you pick?

324
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,506
Rym: Apple core Baltimore.

325
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:03,188
Rym: That's your friend.

326
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:03,770
Scott: Isn't that Disney?

327
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,297
Rym: Yeah, it is, but it's so funny.

328
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,906
Scott: No, it can't be Disney.

329
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:10,339
Scott: Ah Pick a Looney Tune or a melody or something like that.

330
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:13,490
Rym: All right, I could pick one of those really old racist ones.

331
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:18,282
Rym: It's funny how they remade a lot of those not quite so racist.

332
00:22:18,363 --> 00:22:18,945
Scott: Yeah, they did.

333
00:22:19,065 --> 00:22:20,190
Rym: I'm kind of glad they did that.

334
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,073
Scott: Yeah, it's good.

335
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:23,099
Scott: Anyway, no, you didn't pick one.

336
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,002
Rym: Oh right now.

337
00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:27,140
Scott: Yeah, I don't know you said the opera singer All right.

338
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:33,863
Rym: I'm thinking hiding in the stove I think the best line in that one because there was a similar.

339
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:36,740
Rym: there's been a lot of pair of Homages to that.

340
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:37,810
Scott: that's my favorite one.

341
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,034
Rym: Just the line a lot.

342
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:43,350
Rym: when he comes into the room and the other guys locked up and he says I know you've done it.

343
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:45,481
Rym: I don't know how you've done it, but I know you.

344
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:48,415
Scott: I think I think that's the other Mugsy cartoon.

345
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,218
Scott: that's not the same one.

346
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:52,630
Scott: It doesn't matter because that I wanted though is is up there.

347
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,113
Scott: It's way up.

348
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,205
Rym: that line is just one of the funniest things.

349
00:22:55,567 --> 00:23:11,650
Rym: Yeah, it is So All right, so um, I Well, you know I went skiing last weekend and my neck is not broken.

350
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,970
Rym: I've determined it and I think most of my pain is gone.

351
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:28,133
Rym: So I don't think I permanently injured myself, but I remembered skiing and I remember thinking wow, you know It's really not easy for all my friends who don't ski Like it's kind of hard to show like what it's like to be skiing and I was just thinking about that Like man,

352
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:30,190
Scott: I'm sure someone is skied with a camera on their head.

353
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,234
Rym: I'm gonna find something.

354
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:39,630
Rym: but I stumbled upon this on College Humor and I figure this is also interesting because In the summer, you know when I can't ski because I plan to ski a lot from now on.

355
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,685
Rym: But I used to mountain bike a lot and I haven't mountain biked much in the last.

356
00:23:43,745 --> 00:23:47,272
Rym: I don't know three years That's the right verbiage.

357
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:48,414
Scott: Shouldn't it be mountain bickin?

358
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:55,758
Scott: I haven't been Anyway.

359
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:07,620
Rym: So I also remember as a kid whenever I go biking cuz my mom like I come home cut up in it Like I have bruises and I come over like a broken helmet or I like my bike could be just completely destroyed.

360
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:09,480
Scott: My mom would always be like what the hell were you doing?

361
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:17,605
Rym: and I always thought like man, I should just bring a camera and show her and then maybe she understand like what it is that I do here, but I Saw this and I thought of that.

362
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:20,899
Rym: and here you go if you ever wondered what it's like to go mountain biking.

363
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:29,160
Rym: now I'm not talking like downhill mountain biking I'm talking single track with I guess intermediate to like the lower end of the advanced tricks.

364
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,219
Rym: I'll admit there are like five things in this video that there's no way in hell I could have done.

365
00:24:33,902 --> 00:24:38,317
Rym: But if you ever wondered what it's like to go single track mountain biking like that check this out.

366
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:43,354
Rym: It's uh, It's super fun, and I highly recommend you do it if you like getting hurt.

367
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:44,759
Rym: It won't get hurt.

368
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:46,318
Rym: Actually, yes, you will.

369
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,725
Rym: Often when it comes I'll tell you what.

370
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:49,568
Rym: here's the secret.

371
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:53,442
Rym: if you skiing and mountain biking have one thing in common one very important Thing.

372
00:24:54,146 --> 00:25:02,018
Rym: if you see someone who is good at skiing or mountain biking They are only that way because they have hurt themselves several times to get that good.

373
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:03,985
Rym: Yep Right.

374
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:04,349
Scott: All right.

375
00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:15,859
Scott: So so shoddy Dibs no, I win now All right, so you got to talk about all these silly games that people play doorknob.

376
00:25:16,741 --> 00:25:22,100
Rym: Yeah, I think we should because we thought these games are kind of this cultural heritage.

377
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:23,837
Rym: I don't know how it is in the rest of the world.

378
00:25:23,877 --> 00:25:25,224
Rym: in Europe I'm sure they're similar games.

379
00:25:25,264 --> 00:25:32,531
Rym: But in the United States here, there is a long and hallowed tradition of Adolescent males and to a lesser extent females.

380
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:38,580
Scott: They have different games some of them because I don't know Clapping games with the with the rhymes that I can't play.

381
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,017
Rym: I don't know how those work, but I have not known many girls who played doorknob as children.

382
00:25:44,097 --> 00:25:45,060
Scott: No, not really yet.

383
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,680
Rym: It's weird how as a kid I never remember anyone teaching me how to play doorknob.

384
00:25:50,122 --> 00:26:05,743
Rym: I never remember like thinking oh the game doorknob It was just like as far as I can tell as long as I was sentient if a kid farted and I said doorknob I had the unmitigated Human right to wail on them Pretty much.

385
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:10,436
Scott: I mean, it's so strange how there are these games and I remember that I didn't.

386
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:11,900
Scott: I wasn't playing the game forever.

387
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:16,850
Scott: There was a point at which the game sort of came into Daily protocol, but it's.

388
00:26:17,152 --> 00:26:17,675
Scott: it's a game.

389
00:26:17,695 --> 00:26:23,800
Scott: You're always Playing at least among your you know, close friend family company, you know.

390
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,053
Scott: And the game is always on you know, but it's not like.

391
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:30,099
Scott: it's not always on like you're always thinking about it.

392
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,762
Scott: It's just During.

393
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:38,571
Scott: certain events during the day can bring the game into into play, you know And it's you never stop playing it.

394
00:26:38,591 --> 00:26:40,280
Scott: There's no winner loser or anything.

395
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:43,875
Scott: There might be a winner loser of the moment, but there's no there's no end of the game.

396
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:50,115
Scott: It's just this Sort of social rule you put into your life.

397
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,840
Scott: that doesn't really mean anything.

398
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,620
Scott: But you just put it there and it just for no reason whatsoever.

399
00:26:55,224 --> 00:27:01,852
Scott: but somehow that rule and that Protocol spreads like a meme among everybody and everyone's plan.

400
00:27:01,893 --> 00:27:05,886
Scott: even people you've never met before are playing the same game Slightly different rules.

401
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:08,780
Rym: these games spread long before there was an internet.

402
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:09,486
Rym: It's not like.

403
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,160
Rym: the internet allowed this to happen.

404
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,496
Rym: But yet somehow kids in the Midwest played pretty much the same games that kids in California played.

405
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,182
Rym: Yep, except pogs Yep.

406
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:19,005
Rym: All right.

407
00:27:19,045 --> 00:27:23,020
Scott: So so the first game I think the most widespread game of all is shotgun.

408
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Scott: Now shotgun is triggered whenever a group of people are going to get into a motor vehicle.

409
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:29,179
Rym: The thing is shotgun.

410
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,600
Rym: What I what I find interesting about is that it's one of the few of these games that serves a purpose.

411
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:43,833
Rym: It serves a very specific purpose and I've noticed a lot of people seem to play this game more When car space or cars are limited like when you're in high school.

412
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:49,099
Rym: you have the one friend who's 16 and has a car and You're cramming like eight people in that car.

413
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:56,219
Rym: You can cram an infinite number of people in the backseat and it totally sucks But only one person sitting in the passenger seat.

414
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:58,827
Rym: So sitting there is like this holy throne

415
00:27:59,128 --> 00:28:17,128
Scott: and you know, since it usually happens when not everyone owns a car I mean if everyone owns a car then it's not really a big deal because you take enough cars to be comfortable and You know, but when there's only one person who's a driver that person's like, ah, I will always be comfortable But everyone else is like, oh shit.

416
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:18,735
Scott: Only one of us can be comfortable.

417
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:19,397
Scott: Who's it gonna be?

418
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:27,720
Rym: Yep Battle it's like when I was a kid in Michigan just because of the nature of the area No one ever played shotgun because pretty much everyone had a car.

419
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,860
Rym: I mean you could get a. you could buy for $300 you could buy a car that'll get you to school.

420
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:35,780
Scott: But you need because you know, not everyone's gonna be comfortable.

421
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:42,600
Scott: You need some protocol for determining who gets to be comfortable this time and you know There are many things you could arrange to make it fair.

422
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,119
Scott: But in the end everyone just plays shotgun, which is the game of shotgun.

423
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,160
Rym: now I remember that we had basically one car among the entire front.

424
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,828
Rym: Well, maybe one and a half cars among the entire front row crew when we were freshmen Yeah, freshman at least and sophomores.

425
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:59,316
Scott: We still yeah, we still suck.

426
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:00,078
Scott: We had more cars.

427
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,048
Rym: barely We had like two and a half cars.

428
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:05,415
Scott: Yeah, then we got more cars within a year, too Yeah, because we all had money.

429
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:10,740
Rym: finally Yeah, and then we lost all that money because we got cars and now we and now we have cars and money.

430
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:12,028
Rym: Yeah, I barely time.

431
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:13,396
Rym: I barely have a car.

432
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:25,439
Rym: That's true But it's funny how because I remember we were talking about board games a few episodes ago and I remember I said something about how you can tell the geeks or the board game nerds from normal human beings.

433
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:27,346
Rym: because If the geeks sit

434
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:27,767
Scott: around

435
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:42,313
Rym: and play a game made for three-year-olds called peanut butter and jelly Where you play down cards and make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Within five minutes there's going to be an argument as to a possible race condition in the game That is ambiguously defined in the rules.

436
00:29:42,594 --> 00:30:02,055
Rym: Yeah, and the timing considerations of peanut butter and jelly and I point out that I don't know within Two days of the crew front row crew coalescing into a body that had access to 1.5 cars We ran into the problem of how to deal with shotgun because you see we'd all be going somewhere.

437
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:07,152
Rym: We all walk outside and No, we had never really defined what the rules of shotgun were.

438
00:30:07,192 --> 00:30:18,006
Rym: someone would just say it and eventually, you know It was such a high demand commodity that we'd all kind of stand outside the door and then suddenly everyone would yell shotgun Simultaneously and then there'd just be a fight.

439
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:19,231
Scott: So then what do you do?

440
00:30:19,432 --> 00:30:24,930
Scott: it 80 because you know being gamers We all do the best we can to win the game.

441
00:30:25,051 --> 00:30:29,150
Scott: every time we were paying attention where it's on our minds We want to win.

442
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:34,256
Scott: winning is important not even perhaps more important than the actual comfort you get by winning.

443
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:45,819
Rym: and I think that the It came to a head when we were sitting around in the house and someone was like, alright, let's go to the Blah, and I can yep, and then we all said alright, we got a deal with this.

444
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:54,620
Scott: So we came up with a bunch of rules Like if there was a tie then whoever touched the passenger side door handle first gets to be shotgun.

445
00:30:54,921 --> 00:31:00,535
Scott: But if they pull that handle that's preventing the door from unlocking when it's supposed to unlock.

446
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,460
Scott: then they lose their shotgun privileges.

447
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:09,399
Scott: And after someone calls shotgun someone else can say not bitch to avoid sitting in the middle of the backseat.

448
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:14,060
Rym: Some people would go for the preemptive not bitch because they knew they wouldn't get shotgun.

449
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:16,099
Rym: But no one at no one ever goes for second place.

450
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:26,208
Scott: no, no, and then we figured out that you couldn't say shotgun until like some conditions where everyone is walking towards the Vehicle ride and the course was set.

451
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:31,320
Rym: We tried a bunch of different things originally like alright Everyone has to be outside.

452
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:40,815
Rym: So then we'd get into a situation We're like everyone's going outside and I go to get my keys and I walk out and I see everyone Standing on the edge of the door with a foot sticking out.

453
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:41,680
Rym: the doors is waiting.

454
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:49,765
Scott: Many times people would step the last person would you know hide in the bathroom or something or go actually go to the bathroom and Step out last and say shotgun.

455
00:31:50,688 --> 00:31:51,431
Scott: as they stepped out.

456
00:31:51,651 --> 00:31:52,695
Rym: Yeah, I mean everybody.

457
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:54,260
Rym: much people gamed it as much as they could.

458
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,735
Scott: That's that's how a game goes.

459
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:56,199
Scott: you game it.

460
00:31:56,521 --> 00:32:12,677
Rym: I think the eventual like final rule was effectively that the group as a whole had to have come to a Consensus as to where we were going to go what we were going to do there and had begun Generally as a group making movement toward achieving that goal towards

461
00:32:12,717 --> 00:32:13,400
Scott: the motor vehicle.

462
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:17,351
Scott: Yeah, and you know We were going to actually at when we got to the motor vehicle.

463
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:18,657
Scott: that was gonna be we're gonna go.

464
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:24,720
Scott: you could you know Cuz it might have been walking towards the motor vehicle then doing something else then going back to the car and then go.

465
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:34,588
Rym: Yep, if any - if there if there was any action to be taken between Moving and then getting into the car other than opening and closing trivial doors Elevators, I don't think they counted.

466
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,240
Rym: then it was all up for grabs again.

467
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:38,566
Scott: Yeah, so it was.

468
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:44,779
Scott: we got quite serious about that and then you know We only lost that seriousness as we got more cars and drove less.

469
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:46,063
Rym: Yeah, but that is.

470
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:49,593
Rym: I think shotgun is a time-honored tradition among college kids.

471
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:51,900
Scott: I think it's a time also the high school kids.

472
00:32:52,021 --> 00:33:01,226
Scott: it's pretty much very important for and for people who are Putting a lot of people in fewer cars and you know People are wanting comfort now.

473
00:33:01,387 --> 00:33:05,080
Rym: equally important among these games and there are so many different now this one.

474
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:07,086
Rym: Remember how I learned about it.

475
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,089
Scott: Oh really I don't.

476
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:12,880
Rym: I was watching a movie and I don't remember what movie But I've seen a lot of movies.

477
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,039
Rym: I was a little kid and it's a bunch of kids and they're about to go somewhere and something's gonna happen.

478
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:21,318
Rym: and Then suddenly one of them goes one two three not it and then they all go not it one kid goes.

479
00:33:21,478 --> 00:33:25,730
Rym: Ah, man Yeah, I was like, wow, that's a really elegant way.

480
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,455
Rym: I didn't think that's a really elegant way.

481
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:40,720
Scott: I thought hahahahaha Basically when there's something that has to be done By someone like doing the Drano or taking the trash out or paying the check at the restaurant Right one person has to accomplish this task.

482
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,520
Scott: The task must be done by a member of the group right now, but no one wants to do the task.

483
00:33:46,903 --> 00:33:53,001
Scott: You just go one two three Not it and you put a finger on your nose and the last the last person to put a finger on their nose has to Do it.

484
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:57,960
Rym: I think there are a lot of different variations on the game, but I think the basic game is determining.

485
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,671
Rym: It's the shortest straw game and that I like in Michigan.

486
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:14,763
Rym: actually I swear this wasn't racist but a lot of people would say nigs as opposed to dibs, but the etymology of that and I remember very clearly because playing Euchre Right, if you screw up the rules in Euchre like you play now This is also.

487
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,958
Rym: you can do this legitimately to cheat and if no one catches you then you can win.

488
00:34:18,763 --> 00:34:29,664
Rym: But if you play a card that you weren't allowed to play and you're caught it's a renege, you know You've reneged on your deal now just because a lot of people in the Midwest pronounce things Horribly wrong.

489
00:34:30,306 --> 00:34:31,369
Rym: It was renege.

490
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,713
Rym: Oh, man renege.

491
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:38,973
Rym: and because they pronounced it that way Renege and nigg eventually just meant basically not it.

492
00:34:39,154 --> 00:34:40,619
Rym: or you suck or you screwed up.

493
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:43,369
Rym: So they basically it was just reverse not it.

494
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,897
Rym: Mm-hmm or reverse dibs not reverse not it.

495
00:34:45,937 --> 00:34:46,418
Rym: That's dibs.

496
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:49,219
Scott: Yeah, dibs is the exact opposite of the not it game.

497
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,659
Scott: It's when everyone wants something but only there's only one resource and that many people desire and it's sort of the same game as shotgun.

498
00:34:56,841 --> 00:35:02,608
Scott: but basically you just say it's usually like a Saving a seat for the future like hey, man.

499
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:04,032
Rym: I got two pork buns.

500
00:35:04,614 --> 00:35:06,680
Scott: I got dibs, you know, there are two pork buns.

501
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,544
Scott: There are six people.

502
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:08,429
Scott: you say dibs.

503
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:10,440
Scott: now one of the pork buns is yours.

504
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,988
Rym: Now I noticed something really interesting about both these games.

505
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,740
Rym: is that we were talking earlier in the show about like what a sport tests.

506
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:26,279
Rym: It seems like what these games test is Who desires the thing the most and who has the presence of mind to get it?

507
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,134
Rym: But it's not presence of mind.

508
00:35:28,255 --> 00:35:41,105
Rym: as in Like I say I got pork buns and suddenly luke is standing next to me and then suddenly both pork buns are in his mouth But instead it is you know Who who wants it.

509
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,414
Rym: if you really want it then you have the presence of mind.

510
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:46,927
Rym: whoever wanted it the most was thinking I really want that pork bun.

511
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:53,474
Rym: enough to think i'm going to say dibs Yep, or i'm going to say not it and I also.

512
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:54,479
Rym: there's two ways to play.

513
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:54,780
Rym: Not it.

514
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:03,880
Rym: the fundamental ways are either everyone says something and then whoever says it last has to do it or There's the surreptitious, uh finger on the nose, which is my favorite way.

515
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,895
Scott: Yeah, you just put your finger on your nose and you don't say anything.

516
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:13,269
Rym: and then eventually, you know like scott's got his finger on his nose and alex has got his finger on his nose and emily's got her finger on his On her nose and i'm sitting there and I go.

517
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:15,200
Scott: nothing has a finger in Rym's nose.

518
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:19,440
Rym: I see and I go and I look and I see pete doesn't have his finger on his nose.

519
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:22,713
Rym: Oh crap, and I put my finger in my nose And then pete looks around and goes.

520
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:26,300
Scott: Ah And he sees that everyone but him has a finger on the nose.

521
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:28,778
Rym: It's another presence of mind thing and I like it.

522
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:34,415
Scott: Well, you know these games in addition to being fun games of winning and losing and also sort of immature are.

523
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:49,699
Scott: there's social mechanics that You know resolve Situations in a way that everyone can agree upon and generally it works out because basically the person who wants something the most Will usually get it and the person who doesn't want something the most will usually avoid it.

524
00:36:50,382 --> 00:37:00,240
Scott: So, you know out of a group of 10 people if there's something no one wants to do But one person really doesn't want to do it and one person kind of doesn't want to do it this mechanic arranges it.

525
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:08,104
Scott: So even though the one person kind of doesn't want to do it they'll usually end up doing it because everyone wants to do it even less than they do and You know it did.

526
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:11,920
Scott: it kind of works for keeping people happy and together without having a fight.

527
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,366
Scott: I mean, what's the alternative?

528
00:37:13,747 --> 00:37:16,499
Scott: is you sit around and you discuss it for a while because you know.

529
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:18,956
Scott: or Everyone's fighting and yelling and hitting at each other.

530
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:25,060
Scott: I mean Or the mature solution where you just say yeah, i'll do it even though I don't want to okay mature.

531
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:33,264
Rym: Now of course these games can be distilled to the fundamental thing that is known among a lot of people of just The game.

532
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,856
Rym: and there's two, you know, that's the game where you're sitting around.

533
00:37:35,896 --> 00:37:43,575
Rym: then suddenly someone says Ah shit, I lose because they thought of the game or I win which means oh they thought of the game and no one else Did they win?

534
00:37:45,023 --> 00:37:46,348
Rym: Yep, and or there's a lot of like.

535
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:50,140
Rym: I remember the game in michigan that a lot of people play just because you know That was my childhood.

536
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:52,873
Rym: Everything I think of from childhood is from the midwest.

537
00:37:52,913 --> 00:37:53,940
Rym: It was pediddle.

538
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:56,275
Rym: That's the stupidest name for a game ever.

539
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:56,800
Scott: What the fuck?

540
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,409
Rym: It's basically the cyclops game.

541
00:37:58,469 --> 00:38:07,760
Rym: if you're in a car and you see Another car with only one headlight on you punch the roof of the car and yell for diddle And basically you win and everyone else loses because they didn't think of it.

542
00:38:07,941 --> 00:38:08,667
Scott: But what about the game?

543
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:10,100
Scott: yellow car or like punch buggy?

544
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,037
Scott: Same game, you see like a volkswagen then you hit someone else.

545
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:17,119
Rym: Yep Or actually what we played was child molester and it was if you see.

546
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:22,140
Rym: Hey, if you see a conversion van with no windows in the back or one black circular window.

547
00:38:22,281 --> 00:38:25,416
Rym: Yes, that has no company name and no commercial plates.

548
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,079
Rym: Ah And it has to be beat up and it has to be painted brown.

549
00:38:30,145 --> 00:38:31,018
Scott: That just double points.

550
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:35,148
Scott: Yes There's actually a scary child molester.

551
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:38,100
Scott: ish car the car dealer outside that I saw it's it's for sale.

552
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:40,189
Scott: Yeah, it's a pretty scary looking car.

553
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,379
Scott: I don't know who would buy it except a scary person.

554
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,610
Scott: I think they should just whoever looks like a kid.

555
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:46,480
Rym: I think they should just arrest of a cow catcher.

556
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:47,726
Scott: No, i'll show you the car.

557
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:48,470
Scott: It's really scary.

558
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,576
Scott: I think whoever buys that car.

559
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:50,319
Scott: They should just arrest them.

560
00:38:51,261 --> 00:38:52,043
Rym: Maybe it's a trap.

561
00:38:52,324 --> 00:38:52,886
Scott: Maybe it is.

562
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:59,513
Scott: but yet I think the the game that is played the most the game We're trying to stop playing because unlike some of the other games.

563
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:01,000
Scott: It doesn't serve a great purpose.

564
00:39:01,263 --> 00:39:08,659
Rym: I'm one of the few men In the world who has who has played the game for as long as I did and transcended it.

565
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,906
Rym: Yeah, scott didn't believe me.

566
00:39:10,188 --> 00:39:11,053
Rym: He tried.

567
00:39:11,073 --> 00:39:12,220
Rym: he didn't believe that I could do it.

568
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,148
Rym: I didn't believe I could do it, but i've done it.

569
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,657
Scott: i've mostly kind of gotten rid of it kind of But the game is doorknob.

570
00:39:18,698 --> 00:39:24,216
Scott: now The game of doorknob does have a purpose and the purpose is to prevent the old situation.

571
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,520
Scott: because pre doorknob, right?

572
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,463
Scott: What was the situation?

573
00:39:26,523 --> 00:39:33,507
Scott: it was whoever smelt it dealt it whoever made the rhyme committed the crime, you know Who farted bla bla bla bla bla doorknob.

574
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,897
Scott: the game of doorknob sort of encourages a few things.

575
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:52,200
Rym: first of all It slightly encourages not farting at all or holding your farts in until appropriate or or or totally farting And then getting away with it and watching your friend p get totally wailed out even though it totally wasn't him.

576
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:53,800
Scott: That's that can also happen.

577
00:39:53,860 --> 00:40:01,900
Scott: But you know, it would have been so difficult to create a game that would actually discourage actual farting, you know among, uh, you know People.

578
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:05,080
Scott: So we made the doorknob game and we didn't make it.

579
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,241
Scott: It's.

580
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:07,131
Scott: it's a game that just sort of came out of nowhere.

581
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:07,614
Scott: I mean and

582
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:14,100
Rym: it's not always farting I've seen kids play it where if someone swears or if someone says just a certain random word or just yeah

583
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:18,153
Scott: I mean i've been playing it sometime in high school like the game caught on I don't know

584
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:18,494
Rym: how

585
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:22,349
Scott: and it sort of still is Somewhat present a little bit.

586
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,560
Rym: if you don't know the rules of doorknob, it's pretty simple.

587
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:25,704
Rym: There is a condition.

588
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:27,492
Rym: the condition is always active.

589
00:40:27,973 --> 00:40:34,611
Rym: if someone meets the condition Anyone who can see them can say the word doorknob.

590
00:40:34,771 --> 00:40:38,180
Rym: Yep, and that is an indication you have put forth a challenge.

591
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:47,791
Rym: Basically, once the doorknob condition has been met and doorknob has been stated Anyone who is within sight at the time has the legal right.

592
00:40:47,851 --> 00:40:51,503
Rym: as far as i'm concerned the moral imperative to Wail on.

593
00:40:51,523 --> 00:40:53,068
Rym: now wail is the technical term we'll get.

594
00:40:53,108 --> 00:40:56,420
Scott: punch them in the arm repeatedly and with to inflict pain.

595
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,072
Rym: Yes wailing on is a very specific kid thing.

596
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:00,680
Rym: that means punching other kids in the arm.

597
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:02,831
Scott: Yeah, you can't you know punching them in the face.

598
00:41:02,871 --> 00:41:03,293
Scott: You're not.

599
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:06,508
Scott: you're not kicking them in the beans You're not twisting the nips.

600
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:07,654
Rym: It's whoa.

601
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:12,140
Rym: Oh Maybe we should talk about the the first rule of the front row crew.

602
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,560
Scott: It's not so much a game though that fits into the show, but it is the first lot.

603
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,500
Rym: Well, yeah, if anyone has a game that involves titty twisters, you are not cool people.

604
00:41:20,423 --> 00:41:22,471
Rym: Well, unless you're into bdsm, then I guess that's okay.

605
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:23,856
Scott: I guess that's not really a game.

606
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:24,499
Scott: That's just sort of a.

607
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:39,020
Rym: Let me put it this way the first law ever ever passed by the front row crew and it was passed unanimously Was that no member of the front row crew shall ever under penalty of the same by everyone in the room?

608
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,150
Rym: Commits any act upon another front row.

609
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,616
Rym: crew members nipple in anger.

610
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:55,439
Scott: Yep So basically if I were to act upon rims nipple and anger and there were 10 people in the room I would Receive anger upon my nipples tenfold.

611
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:57,219
Rym: It was it was a quite.

612
00:41:58,281 --> 00:42:00,429
Rym: It was you know, I for 10 eyes, I guess.

613
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:00,810
Rym: Yep.

614
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:03,800
Scott: So yeah, no one no one does the titty twisters.

615
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,806
Rym: Yes now second base is totally okay.

616
00:42:05,866 --> 00:42:06,890
Scott: Second base is an anger.

617
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:10,699
Rym: No now if you could somehow commit second base and anger That's just weird.

618
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:12,288
Scott: I guess.

619
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:23,969
Rym: yeah, I guess in A non-permitted I could see I could see a friendly like love punch with the right situation where you accidentally but even then That's not in anger that never happened.

620
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,371
Rym: Luckily.

621
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:26,440
Scott: Yeah, but yeah the game of doors.

622
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,866
Scott: Someone says doorknob you can.

623
00:42:27,886 --> 00:42:38,891
Scott: then if you if let's say Rym farts I say doorknob That means I can hit Rym right now if Rym actually touches a doorknob not a door handle Not a door lever a doorknob.

624
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,600
Scott: if he touches a doorknob now he's safe.

625
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,343
Scott: I gotta let him go.

626
00:42:41,544 --> 00:42:59,652
Rym: the way this game would usually work is there's a group of kids sitting in like a cabinet band camp And then you know someone rips one and then everyone just sits there quiet for a second and then someone Oftentimes it was Nardi when I was in band camp without even looking up would just say doorknob And then you no one ever hit it.

627
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:05,916
Rym: No if doorknob was called I don't think any kid ever would not fess up to it unless someone else stupidly fessed up to it.

628
00:43:06,277 --> 00:43:11,975
Rym: But uh, pretty much one kid would just like Look at everyone and then suddenly just start running.

629
00:43:11,995 --> 00:43:13,423
Scott: see now This is how.

630
00:43:13,443 --> 00:43:14,890
Scott: this is why the game was so great.

631
00:43:15,031 --> 00:43:21,943
Scott: it instead in the olden days I remember like elementary middle school before doorknob times it would be Who farted.

632
00:43:22,405 --> 00:43:22,867
Scott: I don't know.

633
00:43:23,128 --> 00:43:23,811
Scott: We don't know who farted.

634
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,020
Scott: they're not fessing up right but with doorknob, right?

635
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,020
Scott: If you fart and then say safety, no one can call doorknob on you.

636
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:41,054
Scott: So first it encourages people who fart to say safety and announce that they were the ones who indeed farted thus Preventing them from being doorknobbed and often it was kind of a safety.

637
00:43:41,154 --> 00:43:41,375
Rym: as in.

638
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:42,840
Rym: what are you gonna do about it bitches?

639
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,582
Scott: That's right.

640
00:43:43,984 --> 00:43:46,114
Scott: But then again, they just admitted to farting.

641
00:43:46,134 --> 00:43:49,780
Scott: so you now, you know who farted And if it smells really bad, you know who to blame.

642
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:57,540
Scott: The second part is if they don't say safety because they're trying not to admit it Maybe they know it was really smelly or it was a really terrible one and they don't want to be known.

643
00:43:57,881 --> 00:44:06,500
Scott: You get some ruckus when someone when someone says doorknob now They'll usually reveal themselves by running for the doorknob.

644
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,720
Scott: So in the end you find out who did it even if no one got beat up.

645
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:15,853
Scott: And most of the time the game of doorknob reveals the he who passed gas.

646
00:44:16,074 --> 00:44:26,340
Rym: So, uh in van camp we uh, There i'm not gonna name names here But there was a person in the senior guy's cabin who was notorious for uh, letting them rip shall we say.

647
00:44:27,241 --> 00:44:31,494
Rym: And this this this dude this uh, this drummer and bass player.

648
00:44:31,514 --> 00:44:34,359
Rym: He had the the mighty flatulence He was proud of it.

649
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:41,120
Rym: In fact, in fact, he would whenever possible sit in wooden chairs that he could amplify it to the greatest possible effect.

650
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:44,140
Scott: Is he like whittling the chairs to create a sound channel?

651
00:44:44,241 --> 00:44:47,095
Rym: Well the best chair to fart in if you want to make the noise are the wooden chairs.

652
00:44:47,115 --> 00:44:51,651
Scott: they have like the kind of Sanding putting the snare drum under the chair for added effects.

653
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:54,300
Rym: He did fart on his snare drum more than once good god.

654
00:44:54,828 --> 00:44:57,107
Scott: but uh Why don't you just play the?

655
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:59,960
Scott: uh, you know, the the butter phone in the in the van there?

656
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,643
Rym: What there's?

657
00:45:00,683 --> 00:45:02,033
Rym: there's no such thing as a butter phone.

658
00:45:02,073 --> 00:45:02,557
Scott: Yeah, there is.

659
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:06,419
Rym: it sounds like That's not a butter phone that's a butphonium.

660
00:45:08,647 --> 00:45:14,840
Rym: So, uh And doorknob was the game we played but the dude would always sit right next to the door because he premeditated.

661
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:33,499
Rym: So one day he's sitting in the middle of the room We're all sitting around and and another unnamed person who is is famous from another story I told about bandcamp once about a bathroom and an overflowing toilet Sneaks over From the outside of the cabin and he removes the doorknob from the door to the cabin.

662
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:43,819
Rym: And uh one is ripped doorknob is called he saunters over to her with the door knowing that no one's even gonna bother And then he says where the fuck did the doorknob go?

663
00:45:44,986 --> 00:45:47,905
Scott: and Let me tell you that was a good day.

664
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:52,460
Rym: Oh, yeah, because there was no doorknob within like a hundred yards.

665
00:45:53,603 --> 00:45:53,966
Scott: Was this?

666
00:45:53,986 --> 00:45:55,680
Scott: I imagine this is a large man.

667
00:45:56,342 --> 00:45:58,009
Rym: He was uh, quite large.

668
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,720
Scott: the large men are known for two for the flatulence.

669
00:46:01,143 --> 00:46:03,216
Rym: They're also known for not being able to run at all.

670
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:14,173
Scott: thus The game of doorknob has the the added bonus there and that the people who are typically more flatulent Are typically more threatened by the doorknobbing.

671
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:25,120
Rym: So, uh About six months ago, maybe seven months ago one day I farted I ripped one I was playing some game on the wii and scott says doorknob and I said don't you fucking dare i'm done with that game.

672
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,963
Scott: Yeah, the way the game of doorknob ends is when you basically fart you don't say anything and if someone calls doorknob on you You basically.

673
00:46:32,983 --> 00:46:46,139
Scott: because when you're playing the game of doorknob, it's weird You don't consciously decide you just sort of have this rule of society built into you as like you have to actually think outside the box to act outside the rules of the game and

674
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:49,830
Rym: I mean It's definitely ingrained deep in the prime old part parts.

675
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:56,155
Scott: when I was at rit if someone called doorknob on me legitimately And they started hitting me I just couldn't fight back.

676
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:57,040
Scott: that wouldn't even come to me.

677
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:05,376
Scott: But the way to end the game of doorknob is to say if you hit me i'll break your face And thus nobody will call doorknob on you or try to hit you.

678
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:09,500
Scott: because well You're not gonna just cave into the doorknob because you're not playing that game.

679
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:16,638
Rym: You'll actually you know fight back cannot describe to you how difficult it was to not say safety that time.

680
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:20,660
Scott: I farted Yeah, because it was like you have to really have to consciously do it.

681
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,546
Rym: It's like we're sitting there.

682
00:47:21,566 --> 00:47:25,731
Rym: we're playing like icy hockey or something and then Icy hockey.

683
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:29,200
Rym: Yes And then scott looks at me like you didn't say safety.

684
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,591
Rym: He just gives me this look and i'm looking at him right back.

685
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:32,435
Rym: Like are you gonna say it?

686
00:47:32,455 --> 00:47:33,359
Rym: because I didn't say it?

687
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:36,310
Rym: I'm, daring you that was the end of that game.

688
00:47:36,491 --> 00:47:39,000
Scott: Yeah, and so the game mostly ended pretty surprised.

689
00:47:39,262 --> 00:47:46,284
Scott: The result is now people just letting him rip like all over the place Which is fantastic, I guess I don't know.

690
00:47:46,304 --> 00:47:47,977
Rym: There's something about these games where they're.

691
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,171
Rym: They're fun and that's most of what I have to say about them.

692
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:53,240
Rym: Yeah, they're kind of like a rite of childhood.

693
00:47:53,322 --> 00:47:54,279
Rym: They're a rite of passage.

694
00:47:54,781 --> 00:48:01,160
Rym: Everyone plays them and every group has their own little like idiosyncratic rules about the games or special conditions.

695
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:01,743
Rym: And it's just.

696
00:48:01,803 --> 00:48:02,828
Rym: it's great fun there.

697
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:07,179
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely, you know, it's it's I guess It's something.

698
00:48:07,921 --> 00:48:09,186
Rym: Is that all we got to say about that?

699
00:48:09,206 --> 00:48:10,371
Scott: I don't i'm hungry.

700
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:10,833
Scott: I want to eat.

701
00:48:11,034 --> 00:48:12,360
Rym: Yeah, uh, it's thursday.

702
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,154
Scott: I kind of have to do some dishes before I cook.

703
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:21,507
Rym: Yeah We've been uh busy lately shall we say busy busy But there's stuff coming.

704
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:25,503
Rym: swag is on the way and uh It's coming.

00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:30,520
Rym: I gotta tell you when you guys see the shirt that we're gonna be selling as soon as we get them printed.

728
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,955
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows.

729
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:19,182
Scott: It's actually recorded at night All right.

730
00:50:19,243 --> 00:50:21,111
Rym: So, uh, you might notice the show's still going.

731
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:38,159
Scott: emily just reminded us of the one game We forgot which is the perhaps the game i've played the longest just playing this in elementary school the game of jinx where If you say the exact same thing at the exact same time as someone else One of those two people or more multiples of people may call jinx

732
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:43,015
Rym: In which time you cannot say a word until someone says your name.

733
00:50:43,035 --> 00:50:46,449
Rym: if you don't know how jinx is played Watch I think it was season one or two with this.

734
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,734
Scott: Let's let's do an example.

735
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:51,988
Scott: Let's both say, uh, You know, hello at the same time right one two three.

736
00:50:52,088 --> 00:50:55,398
Scott: Hello jinx jinx jinx double jinx.

737
00:50:55,658 --> 00:50:58,330
Rym: I don't know There's different I forget the exact right.

738
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:03,080
Rym: I think scott won that one because uh, He said jinx again before I thought to say it again, right?

739
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:03,761
Scott: All right.

740
00:51:03,781 --> 00:51:07,856
Scott: So because uh, basically now Rym is jinxed but scott just said my name.

741
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:17,759
Scott: so it doesn't matter ah shit But if I didn't if I had not have said the word Rym He would have been jinxed and he would have been unable to say anything at all Until I said Rym and then he would have been able to talk again.

742
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,990
Rym: now, uh There was an episode of the simpsons where lisa has all of her.

743
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:29,070
Rym: uh girly friends stay over and do girly things and among the girly things they uh They basically just torment bard and they jinx him.

744
00:51:29,512 --> 00:51:38,740
Rym: and there there's a perhaps the perfect example of How ingrained these games are because this interaction has probably happened between many young boys and their fathers in the course of life.

745
00:51:39,404 --> 00:51:40,994
Rym: Bart is trying to get his dad to say his name.

746
00:51:41,055 --> 00:51:41,880
Rym: His dad won't say his name.

747
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,787
Rym: So finally he says ah dad say my name.

748
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:46,980
Rym: Why i'm jinxed and he just punches him.

749
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,788
Rym: Bard's dad punches him right then and there.

750
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:50,612
Rym: Oh, what'd you do?

751
00:51:50,632 --> 00:51:52,440
Rym: that for rules the jungle boy?

752
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,110
Scott: Yeah, he was he was jinxed and he was talking.

753
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:55,733
Scott: so he got hit.

754
00:51:55,814 --> 00:51:57,977
Scott: That's That's how the game works.

755
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:02,693
Rym: So, yeah, we couldn't let this show go without talking about jinx.

756
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,380
Scott: Yeah, I can't believe I forgot that one.

757
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,188
Scott: Uh, if there are any others we have gravely forgotten.

758
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:14,099
Scott: or if you have local variations or maybe games that are you know That you play that we didn't mention because we don't know about them.

759
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:17,769
Scott: And so forms are for people but only the always on games.

760
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:22,080
Rym: don't tell me about punch for punch or uh bloody knuckles or quarters.

761
00:52:22,343 --> 00:52:24,060
Rym: There's gonna be another show about that at some point.

762
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,913
Scott: Yeah We're talking about the games that are just sort of always on.

763
00:52:26,953 --> 00:52:28,380
Scott: you're always playing them.

764
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,600
Rym: They're not the game that the third graders taught you about when you were in first grade exactly.
