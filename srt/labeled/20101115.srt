1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,370
Rym: Hey, it's Monday November 15th 2010.

2
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,116
Rym: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:15,600
Rym: tonight the Internet's.

4
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:26,400
Rym: Let's do this Woman.

5
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:27,349
Rym: it is dark.

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,323
Scott: Yeah, it's the Sun and it is not up.

7
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:32,570
Rym: I'm not enjoying this.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,290
Rym: I mean, I work like seven to four and it's dark when I get home at like four or five.

9
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,330
Scott: I don't know why they don't go with my strategy right daylight saving time?

10
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:43,438
Scott: No, well no acts have a better strategy.

11
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,905
Rym: double daylight savings time exactly right.

12
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:50,202
Scott: we should leave daylight savings time as Daylight saving at time.

13
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:51,330
Rym: There's no s whatever.

14
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:59,856
Scott: We should leave that as is but then on the other right and the north and where the quote normal time Which is what we have now, right?

15
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:01,565
Scott: Aren't we currently in normal time?

16
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:02,630
Rym: Yes, we're in normal time.

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,102
Scott: We should make normal time actually an hour earlier in daylight savings time.

18
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:09,167
Scott: It should be double daylight savings time.

19
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:13,090
Scott: I Just think in daylight savings time could be normal time.

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,570
Rym: We should go back to the when it was such that we switch to daylight saving time and we never switch back because it's awesome.

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,395
Rym: It's always better to be on DST.

22
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:24,464
Scott: Oh, here's another is another idea right?

23
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:24,986
Scott: How about this?

24
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:33,007
Scott: How about we just You know when it's not double daylight savings time saving whatever booting to like.

25
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:35,093
Scott: if I owned a company right now I'd be like everyone.

26
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:35,495
Scott: Guess what?

27
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:40,781
Scott: We're just gonna work from seven to three because yeah bullshit I would do that except for one.

28
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:46,187
Rym: I'd be like, yeah work seven to nine Or work until you finish your work and then go home.

29
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:51,590
Rym: But now stock markets open 930 to 4 so I'm kind of so even if your company was cool.

30
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,210
Scott: I mean, it's a stock market company, so they can't change the market.

31
00:01:54,692 --> 00:02:02,289
Rym: However, the day after Thanksgiving every year and every year I forget about this until like right before it happens The markets only open a half day.

32
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:04,079
Rym: So I get a half day.

33
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:08,295
Scott: I get it zero day One of the few zero days I get.

34
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:14,097
Rym: yeah, cuz you technically worked from home while we were in Boston that week I used a week of vacation.

35
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:15,830
Rym: Yeah, I'm out of vacation days.

36
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:17,970
Scott: Well, I wouldn't use a vacation day and a half day.

37
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,308
Scott: Anyway, even though you'd only have to use half a vacation, but if I work a full day, I get a vacation day.

38
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,034
Scott: Anyway, anyway, it's dark.

39
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,739
Rym: Yeah messing up my mojo.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,384
Scott: I know not a fan really.

41
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:35,205
Rym: I got of course being brilliant I bought my bike lights right before the end of biking season.

42
00:02:35,246 --> 00:02:36,030
Rym: They're sitting in my drawer.

43
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:38,038
Scott: I know I stopped biking about a month ago.

44
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:38,661
Scott: I'll start.

45
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,047
Scott: I'll start again when it's warm again.

46
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:40,790
Rym: Yeah, so we stopped biking.

47
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:42,159
Rym: It's super nice out today.

48
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:42,904
Scott: I know right.

49
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:43,749
Scott: What can I do about that?

50
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,825
Scott: I already bought an unlimited subway pass and I had to go to this conference thing.

51
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:48,870
Scott: So I wasn't about to bike today.

52
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,884
Scott: Yeah, then I'll bike again as soon as the.

53
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:52,970
Scott: you know, like mark.

54
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:55,690
Rym: So I got some news some tech news that I think is worth talking about.

55
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,190
Rym: But I want to take an aside and aside.

56
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:04,570
Rym: I was looking at this as a thing of the day because you know I like those nerd kind of tests like remember that old like super nerd test.

57
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,998
Rym: That was like all text a thousand questions long.

58
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:08,042
Rym: No, really.

59
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,530
Rym: That was the kind of a big internet culture thing.

60
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,235
Rym: Okay, late 90s never heard of it.

61
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:16,550
Rym: Really really really major geek tag out of it your nerd tag any of that stuff?

62
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,554
Scott: Yeah, Wow.

63
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:19,562
Rym: Well, did you ever hang out on usenet?

64
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:20,265
Scott: No.

65
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,310
Scott: Oh, okay.

66
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:30,550
Rym: Anyway, so info world which ostensibly and I say ostensibly because we know that that is in fact not true Knows something about technology.

67
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:35,590
Rym: It is a technology magazine and they made their 2010 info world geek IQ test.

68
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,763
Scott: Apparently they made a 2009 one also that shows up in a Google search.

69
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:39,908
Rym: So I saw it.

70
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,155
Rym: I was like, alright I'll take this test.

71
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:42,426
Rym: It'll be funny be a thing of the day.

72
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:42,930
Rym: It'll be cool.

73
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,877
Rym: You know something.

74
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:45,370
Rym: we can all take and share our scores.

75
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:47,618
Rym: This test proved to me a couple of things.

76
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:51,030
Rym: one whoever wrote it has no idea what Linux is or how it works.

77
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:52,357
Scott: Well, I mean bear.

78
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,750
Rym: he's probably not used Linux since about.

79
00:03:55,852 --> 00:04:03,690
Scott: Yeah Or you know, this is one of those situations where it's like somebody just throws something together.

80
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,845
Scott: Right for you know, just because they're going to throw it together, right?

81
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:10,430
Scott: They're not actually trying hard at it.

82
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,615
Scott: They're not trying to make it good.

83
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,101
Scott: They're just trying to get some hits.

84
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:15,070
Scott: It's probably got him a lot of hits last year.

85
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,180
Scott: They're probably hey, let's do it again this year.

86
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:20,176
Scott: You get the same awesome number of hits We got last year, but what?

87
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,246
Scott: I just slapped it together one, two, three.

88
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:26,730
Scott: real quick Easy peasy took him ten minutes at work so you can go play solitaire again.

89
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:30,386
Rym: See, but I'm gonna go one step further and it totally worked and got a bunch of hits.

90
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:31,190
Scott: and now you're talking about it.

91
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:39,183
Rym: That is probably true actually only like less than 200 people noted it in like Facebook and it's actually not Getting that many hits as far as I can say.

92
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:39,747
Scott: info world.

93
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:44,017
Rym: That's a lot but it shows something more interesting to get.

94
00:04:44,037 --> 00:05:01,930
Rym: whoever it is who actually made this thing clearly is a Mediocre to average Windows IT sysadmin who has used Linux but does not know anything about Linux and Probably either played D&D or more likely knows someone in the office who has played D&D and asked him for a question.

95
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:05,810
Scott: Yeah, also, this is a person doesn't understand what IQ means right?

96
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:14,703
Scott: I mean at least if you get you know Obviously you can call it an IQ test and it's never gonna be a legitimate IQ test But you can at least make it resemble an IQ test.

97
00:05:14,703 --> 00:05:22,690
Scott: 90% of these questions Most of them are basically do you know this, you know, do you have this fact memorized?

98
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,472
Scott: But it's not.

99
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:26,139
Scott: if not search on Google and you will find out it.

100
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:31,598
Rym: the facts themselves are just very like old Busted Windows system centric.

101
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,087
Scott: Maybe that's just the audience for info world.

102
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:34,830
Scott: is that kind of person?

103
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,453
Rym: That's what I hope.

104
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:36,339
Rym: that's what I was getting to.

105
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:44,350
Rym: my conclusion based on all of this Is that info world is out of touch and is basically the magazine for people who learn Windows administration in?

106
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,559
Rym: 1999 yeah, and if touch Linux once or twice.

107
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,101
Rym: Mmm.

108
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:54,113
Rym: I mean 10 base - really I Was just.

109
00:05:54,394 --> 00:05:57,910
Rym: I was taken aback by this to where I wanted to call it out for being stupid.

110
00:05:58,476 --> 00:05:59,750
Scott: It is quite the stupid test.

111
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,814
Rym: So whoever wrote this?

112
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:03,744
Rym: if you uh, this comes to you the wind of our anger.

113
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,350
Rym: I'd like to talk to you.

114
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,375
Scott: I'd like to find out more about why you made this and of course if anyone wants to just make fun of Rym Just say all Rym.

115
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,187
Scott: you just call the test stupid cuz you sucked at it.

116
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:15,262
Scott: You got all them right.

117
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:16,647
Scott: you would have said it was an awesome All right.

118
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:17,494
Rym: So I miss.

119
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:22,355
Rym: I miss number three how much RAM does 32-bit Windows 2008 server handle?

120
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:23,780
Rym: because I don't I didn't fucking know I.

121
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,010
Scott: the only question I really wanted to say an error wrong because that's bullshit.

122
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:34,334
Scott: The only question I want to dispute is a final question question 20 and it says which is the following has the best chance to Protect your users identities?

123
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:39,690
Scott: and the choices were like virus scanners spyware detector Rocco the bodyguard and something else.

124
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,515
Scott: And the fact is I have.

125
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:53,453
Scott: I have a strong argument that Rocco the bodyguard can protect the users identity better than a spyware Detector because what will happen is the anytime the user goes to type in their name or any personal information into their computer Rocco

126
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:53,857
Rym: will hit them

127
00:06:53,998 --> 00:07:02,790
Scott: in the face And it won't matter how much spyware viruses are on the computer if Rocco prevents them from typing in any personal information on the keyboard.

128
00:07:03,452 --> 00:07:08,446
Scott: That will perfectly protect the users identity even with a spyware detector if Rocco's not there.

129
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:13,670
Scott: if they type in Any personal information to any website ever they basically just giving away everything.

130
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:16,303
Scott: So the correct answer is Rocco.

131
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:17,750
Scott: the my city didn't get all their answers, right?

132
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,611
Scott: You know?

133
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:23,990
Rym: especially interesting was the question about how do you restart a printer service on a lip it?

134
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,846
Rym: Like none of the answers actually really work on modern systems and the real answer is you go into your GUI and hit restart.

135
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:36,121
Scott: Yeah This is the web interface and the restart button.

136
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:38,068
Rym: this was kind of like punching a guy in a wheelchair.

137
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:41,978
Rym: but So you have any real news ever?

138
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:43,264
Scott: real news, you know, it's.

139
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:44,330
Scott: it's sort of a news.

140
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,803
Scott: It's on the star calm which I assume is a local newspaper Orlando star.

141
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:50,428
Scott: It just says the star.

142
00:07:50,448 --> 00:07:51,070
Rym: It's only star.

143
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,647
Scott: I know I can't really tell where this is from.

144
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,208
Scott: Ryan Toronto it's a Toronto star.

145
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,781
Scott: Anyway, they have an article I think it might.

146
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,470
Scott: oh it's a staff reporter so it's not even AP good for them.

147
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:09,830
Scott: At least it says Cathal Kelly staff reporter and basically this article doesn't talk about anything new.

148
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:15,050
Scott: I just wanted to discuss the things that we already you know, this old news, but I want to discuss it, right?

149
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:15,817
Rym: But how old news?

150
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:16,806
Rym: we talking like 90s vintage?

151
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,563
Scott: I mean first of all, the article was published on December 30th.

152
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:21,487
Scott: Oh 9, right Wow.

153
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,257
Scott: And second of all, that's for you retro.

154
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:28,271
Scott: the information in this article is information that I've known since 2000.

155
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:31,723
Scott: So this is like decade old news, but it's new for a lot of people.

156
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:34,489
Rym: We just said 1999 2000 That's a decade.

157
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,193
Scott: Yeah, we're old.

158
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:41,145
Scott: So anyway, basically what this article talks about is how Israeli airports pretty much.

159
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,489
Scott: There's only one of them, right?

160
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:45,530
Scott: This is only one really important one.

161
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,837
Rym: This is airport security, isn't it?

162
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:50,246
Scott: Yeah, which I went to in the year 2000, right?

163
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:51,089
Scott: So I know all about it.

164
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,081
Rym: You know, well, you know all about it from a decade ago.

165
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:55,808
Scott: It hasn't changed that much.

166
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,370
Scott: Basically they have incredible security.

167
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:05,362
Rym: It's it's like off the charts One of the places that is most likely to have problems.

168
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:08,070
Scott: they have basically problems all the time.

169
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,664
Scott: It's basically like this huge target and it hasn't been breached since.

170
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:15,840
Scott: Oh - so somebody Accidentally carried a handgun onto a flight.

171
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,185
Scott: It wasn't even a terrorist or anything.

172
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:21,925
Rym: I can just picture a guy You know the the Secret Service bus in and they're gonna kick his ass.

173
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:22,427
Rym: He's like, dude.

174
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:23,270
Rym: Sorry my mistake.

175
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:27,243
Scott: And basically they have no lines at least not compared to us.

176
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:28,567
Scott: right and there's a few.

177
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:29,510
Scott: there's a few things here.

178
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:36,765
Scott: I mean if you want the actual details of how they make it more secure Right, you can read this article and it talks about how most of what they do is.

179
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:42,530
Scott: they just look at people Like look them in the eyes and talk to them because if you're a terrorist you're gonna be mad nervous.

180
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:45,590
Scott: And if you're mad nervous watch out cuz they're gonna run out and grab you, right?

181
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,439
Scott: But if you're just a normal person like what's up?

182
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,450
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to friggin, you know, New York.

183
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,247
Scott: They'd be like, alright go on.

184
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,321
Rym: Well, I have this funny feeling that there's some things they don't do that we could.

185
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:58,312
Rym: probably I'll bet they don't frisk paraplegics No, they don't really right What?

186
00:09:58,512 --> 00:09:59,536
Scott: basically what they do these?

187
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:03,890
Scott: the one secure thing that they do is they scan your bags basically immediately, right?

188
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,750
Scott: It's like you bring a bag in scan it, right?

189
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:16,110
Scott: You know, that might be a good idea because there's a bigger line in security In the airport the places where there are lines the lines are staggered so you can't attack the line itself, right?

190
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,590
Scott: You can attack a small portion of the line, but you couldn't get all these people in line all at once.

191
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:20,958
Rym: Smart that makes sense.

192
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:21,622
Scott: He gasped.

193
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:22,528
Scott: They're smart anyway.

194
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,910
Scott: And when they scan the bags, right basically, let's say there was a bat.

195
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,270
Scott: Let's see you're in the jet blue terminal at JFK, right?

196
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,762
Scott: Yep, and they were scanning a bag and had a bomb in it.

197
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,430
Scott: bowling ball candle bowling ball candle.

198
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:34,771
Scott: What.

199
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:35,454
Scott: what would they do?

200
00:10:35,755 --> 00:10:38,225
Scott: What the TSA do if they saw a bomb in the x-ray machine?

201
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:42,819
Rym: probably go And then call for a supervisor to come over and go.

202
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,690
Scott: No, well, they would have to evacuate the whole place, right?

203
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:50,435
Rym: Yeah, once they actually say yes, it's a bomb for sure, right They would probably ground.

204
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:53,004
Rym: every goddamn flight will cancel everything.

205
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:54,510
Scott: point is is that at the bare minimum?

206
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,590
Scott: You have to evacuate the whole terminal because that bomb is threatening every the entire area where the people are crowded, right?

207
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,830
Rym: But I have a feeling that flights would be stopped for like a day.

208
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:16,219
Scott: So the Israeli people right that when they scanning these bags They're in a little room and the room can withstand like a ton of explosion, but you know before actually You know getting out of the room It's not a you know bomb proof room But it's you know, it's it's a strong

209
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:16,884
Rym: like my watch.

210
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:17,850
Rym: It's not waterproof.

211
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:21,510
Scott: And then is this basically the people that are in the room doing the scanning?

212
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:27,830
Scott: They're trained if they see something suspicious to drop it in the bomb box, which is basically a blast proof box.

213
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,814
Rym: I want a bomb box.

214
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:30,461
Scott: It's basically an invincible box.

215
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:31,586
Scott: They drop their pet.

216
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:39,490
Scott: They'll take your bag They'll toss it in the bomb proof box and then they call the experts to come and deal with it And then they'll leave the room and then a bomb squad will just come and take the bomb box away.

217
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:47,462
Scott: I'll bet when that happens, you're not even delayed your bag You just keep going in line.

218
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,650
Rym: see I actually have something to say.

219
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,085
Rym: I mean aside from all the obvious in America and they don't take your shoes.

220
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,210
Scott: They don't check any of that.

221
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:58,692
Rym: One dude fire once.

222
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:10,570
Rym: and and actually I saw all these like we got a notice at work even about how this holiday season because they have the backscatter which actually Not being you know, there are there's things now where they say it's not safe.

223
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:18,950
Rym: Yeah, I was gonna say straight up not being like pseudoscience aside There are legitimate health and safety concerns about those backscattering machines and I would not consent to going through one.

224
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:20,210
Scott: I would also not go through one.

225
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,690
Rym: So there is a national opt-out day because apparently I at least I thought that all the pilots were opting out.

226
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:26,414
Rym: Yeah, they are.

227
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,626
Rym: there's a big but now passengers can opt out to.

228
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:34,563
Rym: the rule Is that if you opt out then they'll grope you and they fucking grope you.

229
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:37,512
Rym: they they even warn you that your genitals will be Touched.

230
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:41,548
Scott: All right, so I should be like hey, no you should do you till a kill.

231
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:43,775
Rym: No underwear.

232
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,309
Rym: and FARC had the added bonus of don't wipe.

233
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:48,994
Scott: They wear gloves.

234
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:49,857
Scott: they wear gloves.

235
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:52,044
Rym: Yeah, but that would still make at least one FARC.

236
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:58,534
Scott: I'm not gonna give myself a diaper rash No, I'm not gonna ruin my utility, but I would gladly I'll let him grope me.

237
00:12:58,554 --> 00:12:59,558
Scott: I'll be like, yeah.

238
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:00,823
Rym: No, but think about this.

239
00:13:01,124 --> 00:13:06,010
Rym: if everyone opts out It's a disaster for the airport an absolute disaster.

240
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:10,719
Scott: They don't have it all because they don't send everyone through that machine So not everyone has the opportunity to opt out.

241
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,845
Scott: most people just go through normal.

242
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:14,887
Scott: Like yeah It's only some people get sent to the machine.

243
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:17,095
Rym: I mean What else can I say?

244
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:18,481
Rym: I'm sick of this bullshit.

245
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:20,370
Rym: I only fly because it's the only vibe.

246
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,926
Scott: But anyway, basically the why did you know the airport in Israel do this, right?

247
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:27,370
Scott: Why didn't they do it the way we do it?

248
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:45,475
Scott: well, basically what happened was and this is what I really want to touch on here right is that You know originally they had the kind of you know security we had and basically This is like 50 years ago, by the way, right and the Israelis are like half-hour wait Fuck that shit.

249
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:49,389
Scott: and they were pissed and they were angry and they were like fuck you, right?

250
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,845
Scott: And the big problem I think is that people in the US and also Canadians it says right here.

251
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:56,290
Scott: We're just too nice.

252
00:13:56,673 --> 00:14:02,470
Scott: It's like we'll be like, okay Okay, I'm not gonna be I'm not gonna start a fuss.

253
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,619
Scott: Israeli guy would just be like you want to grope me.

254
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,924
Scott: I dare you grope me.

255
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,228
Scott: I'll just punch your lights out.

256
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:10,911
Scott: Fuck you Here's.

257
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:13,280
Rym: here's I think why I don't think Americans are nice.

258
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:16,170
Rym: I think Americans are afraid of getting arrested.

259
00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:20,030
Rym: Well, I mean that's I'm real nice to the TSA mouth breathers.

260
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,118
Scott: Well, that's another another factor right.

261
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:25,130
Scott: is that the Israelis right these people doing the scanning, right?

262
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,600
Scott: This is this is one of the reasons why I don't think it'll work in America.

263
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,849
Scott: trained professionals trained professional, of course.

264
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:34,486
Scott: Look they're looking at people in the eyes ask them questions and judging them.

265
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:39,124
Rym: this takes a skilled Intelligent person who's sorry, you've got a bowling ball candle in your bag.

266
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,028
Rym: What the fuck?

267
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:41,640
Scott: Yeah Well, you know this is before.

268
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:51,590
Scott: this is like when you're in your car You drive it to the airport someone comes over and it looks at you and judges you psych You know gives you you know evaluates you by looking at you and judging your mannerisms, right?

269
00:14:52,010 --> 00:15:02,411
Scott: This takes a trained professional someone who is not just a minimum wage TSA person, you know I'm sure there are plenty of TSA people who are not minimum wage morons, but there are many who are you know What.

270
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:06,348
Rym: even if they're smart, it's not like they have any discretion and the Israeli like they can be like.

271
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:07,293
Rym: I'll do it Smartly.

272
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:09,889
Scott: Israel has mandatory military service, right?

273
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:14,150
Scott: So everyone pretty much is a security professional.

274
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:19,230
Scott: See actually and the people who have this as their job, right everyone, you know.

275
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,430
Scott: It's like they're trusting them because they're all skilled.

276
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:28,315
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like if you're all military guys and this military guys You know scanning your bags.

277
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:32,050
Scott: It's like you trust that they're professionals cuz you know, you're a professional and they're with you, right?

278
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,030
Scott: But when you're in the US, you don't trust the TSA.

279
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:37,823
Scott: They're all morons and you're right not to trust them.

280
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:39,090
Rym: I don't even trust them with my bag.

281
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:42,710
Scott: So the fact you know, it's because you don't trust them, right?

282
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,389
Scott: You basically you need a procedure that you can trust because you don't trust the people.

283
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:50,338
Scott: or in Israel you can trust.

284
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:56,175
Scott: you can trust the people so you they don't really need the the procedure We don't.

285
00:15:56,215 --> 00:16:00,270
Rym: we can't trust the people so we make a procedure that theoretically we can trust.

286
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:06,030
Rym: Yes, like zero tolerance policies in our schools exactly like pretty much everything in our society.

287
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:07,859
Scott: So, you know two problems.

288
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,144
Scott: this illustrates number one.

289
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:10,250
Scott: We're too damn nice.

290
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:14,788
Scott: You got to get pissed off and be a bad job to get even even if you don't.

291
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:15,913
Rym: you know A lot of people.

292
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:18,666
Scott: they just have the opinion that like you have to be nice.

293
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:19,670
Scott: being nice is important.

294
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,598
Scott: Look at like the whole south of the US where they value having good manners Even if they're actually races.

295
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:27,105
Rym: wait now Scott that all of them are.

296
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:28,170
Rym: you might go a little too far.

297
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:35,228
Rym: I'm happy with the fact that when I'm in line at Starbucks and the guy in front of me is slightly delayed He doesn't flip the fuck out.

298
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:37,279
Scott: You don't need to flip the fuck out.

299
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:39,410
Scott: There's a such thing as going too far, right?

300
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,057
Rym: I don't even want to hear him yell.

301
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:45,338
Rym: I just want him to just quietly be like, thanks Yeah, and then I get my coffee.

302
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,670
Scott: No, but I'm saying is that there is you know Like for example, right there is there is a line right?

303
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,836
Scott: I mean like you you can't be.

304
00:16:53,418 --> 00:16:57,470
Scott: it's not a good idea to just flip out and be unproductively angry and disruptive.

305
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:04,117
Rym: Actually now I take but I want to see people flip the fuck out because I just remember the last time I actually saw Someone flipped the fuck out in line.

306
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:04,500
Rym: You know what?

307
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:05,306
Scott: It was awesome.

308
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:11,465
Scott: It was hilarious Right, but it's flipping out and yelling and making a scene are not productive.

309
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:15,950
Rym: What is dude, but Didn't have whipped cream in it, right?

310
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:23,417
Scott: But at the same time just being tolerant and taking it up the ass willingly and then saying thanks Right and having good manners about it.

311
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:24,824
Scott: It's also not helping.

312
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:28,215
Scott: but something is Inconveniencing to the point there.

313
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,059
Scott: It's a problem.

314
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,807
Scott: You need to be like, hey, this is a problem If Starbucks is taking too long sleep without paying.

315
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:36,718
Rym: Yeah Here's the problem with that one Starbucks.

316
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:38,104
Rym: if you have a problem you go to leave.

317
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:40,135
Rym: they not only do they not care But they give you a thing.

318
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:41,767
Rym: They'll give you free coffee at any Starbucks.

319
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:49,336
Scott: That's true But that's that's a good reason to be rude at the Starbucks, you know, I mean, you know just The Commons.

320
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:51,523
Rym: it doesn't actually works out pretty well.

321
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:53,168
Scott: the problem still but it was not it.

322
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,301
Scott: look in Israel Everyone is so angry about a half-hour wait.

323
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,647
Scott: Yes that it fixed things.

324
00:17:57,707 --> 00:17:58,310
Scott: No break them.

325
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,004
Rym: Here's where I disagree with you because it's not that Americans are nice.

326
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,490
Rym: We're not buying large.

327
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:07,770
Rym: It's that we're afraid of getting arrested and we don't have an alternative to flying.

328
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,154
Scott: That's also true.

329
00:18:10,194 --> 00:18:16,709
Scott: is that you know anyone in Israel only really flies to go somewhere else other than Israel Whereas in the United States, right?

330
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:21,231
Scott: I feel like I get anywhere because it's so damn big and I think that is you know That's.

331
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:32,687
Scott: one of the fundamental problems of why is the US not different from all other places is because it's so goddamn Geographically big, you know, even someplace like Russia you like all Russia's geographically big China's geographically.

332
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:35,118
Rym: Yeah, no one lives out there No one lives out in the right.

333
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:36,907
Scott: It's like people don't live in Siberia.

334
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,470
Scott: you take Russia.

335
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,718
Scott: It's like well, where's the places where people actually live?

336
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:41,424
Scott: Well, really only this area.

337
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:42,990
Scott: Oh, well, it's not so big then is it?

338
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,870
Scott: I mean, it's still big but it's not as USB.

339
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:47,050
Rym: Of course, we could have those things if we localize them.

340
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,775
Scott: It's like China.

341
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:50,894
Scott: people really only live mostly on the East Coast Like I would I.

342
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:54,310
Rym: I hope this initiative to have high-speed rail actually comes to fruition in the Northeast.

343
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:57,766
Rym: Imagine if we had high-speed rail connecting all the major cities in the northeastern seaboard.

344
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:58,750
Scott: I use that shit all the time.

345
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,777
Rym: Yeah, actually now bolt bus.

346
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:04,529
Rym: Yeah, but I'm not flying to animate Boston.

347
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:06,079
Rym: at least I don't think I'll fly to PAX East.

348
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:06,764
Rym: we gotta sort that out.

349
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:07,287
Scott: We'll figure it out.

350
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:13,748
Scott: Anyway, if you if you didn't know this stuff already because this is old news It's you know now and now it's new news to you.

351
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:18,224
Rym: But I highly recommend if nothing else opt out if you can if you are.

352
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:20,010
Rym: if don't let them back scatter you.

353
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,434
Scott: Yeah, and don't you know?

354
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:23,662
Scott: be groped instead enjoy the groping.

355
00:19:23,702 --> 00:19:24,806
Rym: so you wanna have some real fun.

356
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:31,898
Scott: as soon as they grope you scream Dude I got a better idea ready.

357
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,350
Scott: Yeah chop them off be a eunuch and then get grope.

358
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:35,549
Scott: They'll be like whoa.

359
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,341
Scott: Yeah, that's worth it or no even better.

360
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:40,630
Scott: Just cross dress and go for the groping much easier.

361
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:43,418
Rym: That's brilliant cuz.

362
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:44,285
Scott: then you're a dude.

363
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,030
Scott: you'll get a girl.

364
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,897
Scott: I can't get the other person to grope you.

365
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:50,450
Rym: every single one of you cross players who flies to an anime con.

366
00:19:50,852 --> 00:19:52,563
Rym: Wear your shit on the plane.

367
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,610
Rym: This is gonna be awesome.

368
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:56,970
Scott: It's gonna be like I'll get groped if I go this right this way ma'am.

369
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,229
Scott: And it's like you go and you get the girl comes to grope you and yeah, that's right.

370
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,185
Scott: So or right even just as good right you're it.

371
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:13,290
Scott: you're dressed like a woman Right or your dress is the opposite and you go to the correct person.

372
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:14,254
Scott: So you're a girl.

373
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:15,419
Scott: you look like a girl.

374
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,287
Scott: you go up to get groped by the guy.

375
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:22,427
Scott: He's like And he gropes you in this junk and you give him like a wink.

376
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:27,829
Rym: I Just every vision of this in my head is willing to file.

377
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,670
Scott: You can get a lot of a lot of good stuff going on there.

378
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,902
Rym: So I don't want to talk about this too much because we have to actually see.

379
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:43,752
Rym: this is going to be staged in over time Like in the coming months, but the headlines were Facebook's making a gmail killer, which is not true Not even close to true.

380
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:50,230
Rym: Basically Facebook is trying to make a product called ICQ all over again and integrated with Facebook.

381
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,730
Rym: Basically Facebook originally the announcements for all the Facebook's making an email system compete with Gmail.

382
00:20:57,272 --> 00:21:02,959
Rym: It's actually much more interesting than that and the TL;DR version of this I guess TL;DL.

383
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:06,939
Rym: Okay, TL;DL too long to listen.

384
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:15,712
Rym: Is that what they're making is A good idea for people who don't understand technology and don't use the technology They already have?

385
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:16,254
Rym: effectively?

386
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:19,969
Rym: it is not that useful for people who do both of these things.

387
00:21:20,552 --> 00:21:26,970
Rym: They're adding a sort of email you can use their Facebook that has a social inbox Which is basically a filtered inbox.

388
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:36,049
Rym: So instead of getting all your mail in one inbox all your social mail meaning anything that came from any of your friends Goes into one mailbox and everything else goes into a general mailbox.

389
00:21:36,873 --> 00:21:39,081
Rym: Of course, it's Facebook gonna be full of spam.

390
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:40,967
Scott: Well, I could just do that with the Gmail filter.

391
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:41,650
Rym: Oh, yeah, you could.

392
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:48,970
Rym: So it automatically will show you anything from a friend or a friend of a friend to the bane of orchid.

393
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:50,935
Rym: So we'll see how that goes.

394
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:54,890
Rym: and you can like kick people out of your inbox and back in and you can import people.

395
00:21:55,672 --> 00:22:06,555
Rym: the other thing it's doing and again, these are all just incremental improvements that are being done together is Aggregation much like what the palm pre did where if I SMS you and you G talk me back It just keeps it all in one stream.

396
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:07,659
Scott: That's like Google voice.

397
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:10,590
Scott: Yeah and Google plus Gmail plus Google time.

398
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,850
Rym: So they're doing that a little bit better and that they're actually just making one contiguous stream.

399
00:22:15,011 --> 00:22:19,190
Rym: But the way they're doing it is really geared towards short conversations.

400
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:21,937
Rym: It's pretty much exactly what ICQ was.

401
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:25,787
Rym: only it's as though you had ICQ on every possible device all the time.

402
00:22:25,807 --> 00:22:26,549
Rym: Mm-hmm.

403
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:28,693
Rym: and The weird part is.

404
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:40,250
Rym: the third like aspect of this is the box of letters and they make this point that in the old days You know, wouldn't it be great if you had a record of every conversation you ever had with your best friend or with your girlfriend?

405
00:22:40,411 --> 00:22:45,854
Scott: Yeah, I do too and they're like and you know, I deleted a bunch of them over time But I still have a lot.

406
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:47,021
Scott: they're like my grandma.

407
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:47,463
Rym: I had that.

408
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:48,590
Rym: it was called a box of letters.

409
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:50,598
Rym: No one does that anymore and it's so sad.

410
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:55,549
Rym: and all I could think was I have every chat and email I've ever exchanged in my entire life.

411
00:22:56,094 --> 00:22:57,950
Rym: Yeah all the way back to when I first got a nice.

412
00:22:58,412 --> 00:22:59,134
Scott: All them ever.

413
00:22:59,154 --> 00:23:05,055
Scott: but I still have a lot of them and I had logs at various times and I just deleted or got rid Of them or whatever, but I still have.

414
00:23:05,136 --> 00:23:08,870
Rym: hey, I'm that guy with the hat who was at the gaming night.

415
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,841
Rym: You want to go to the anime club after dinner at Gracie's?

416
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:13,969
Rym: Yeah, that is the first thing I ever chatted to you.

417
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:15,798
Scott: Yeah, all right.

418
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:16,807
Scott: Did you just look that up now?

419
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:19,789
Rym: Yeah I looked it up a little while ago because I knew I wanted to talk about this.

420
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:26,890
Rym: Okay, but it basically they're taking all the way once you get the head again that I got the head around somewhere.

421
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:28,518
Rym: Actually, Emily got me a new hat.

422
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,870
Rym: It's much more comfortable than that one gonna strap a dinosaur.

423
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:33,855
Rym: Don't remind me about that guy.

424
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:36,003
Rym: or else after talk about duck boy.

425
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:37,910
Scott: You can strap a wooden duck to the head.

426
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,422
Scott: Wow, the rubber ducky to the head.

427
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:43,749
Rym: that was a decade ago.

428
00:23:44,314 --> 00:23:53,090
Rym: Yeah, anyway, so Facebook's thing is going to make people who are already Facebook people more Facebook people.

429
00:23:53,150 --> 00:24:03,490
Rym: It's not going to affect other people and it's actually a good feature, but it's not a gmail killer It's not anything new even it's just Facebook doing incremental and obvious improvements.

430
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:11,230
Scott: You know I don't like is this trend now of Rolling out a feature to some people and then some more people and some more people right because Twitter did this with the new Twitter?

431
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:14,170
Scott: Look, yeah, it's like the people who it just it was so random.

432
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,604
Scott: It was like people who actually use Twitter and wanted it just wouldn't get.

433
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:20,100
Scott: I got didn't get it for the longest time But other people got it right away.

434
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,270
Scott: It's like and they took him.

435
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,746
Scott: So, I mean obviously it's better for keeping their systems up and to test things out.

436
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:25,570
Rym: I didn't know.

437
00:24:25,651 --> 00:24:26,882
Rym: I thought people were stupid one day.

438
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:34,233
Scott: all I see all these tweets like And to expose people to like less, you know bugs because it's always good to run in a beta you want to do.

439
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:42,184
Scott: the reason they do betas and stages is because what happens with the beta is you put a beta out and Everyone reports the same exact bug and then you fix it and it's like.

440
00:24:42,224 --> 00:24:43,890
Scott: those people already reported a bug.

441
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,890
Scott: They're not reporting anymore.

442
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,210
Scott: So you got to roll it out to even new people and they'll report the second bug and it's basically each wave.

443
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:51,016
Scott: It's one more bug reported.

444
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,605
Rym: almost, you know, I like NS to every time this new build.

445
00:24:53,645 --> 00:24:55,170
Rym: I play it once I hit a game-breaker.

446
00:24:56,361 --> 00:25:01,510
Scott: The thing is a slow release is very very good for the company doing the release, right?

447
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:15,685
Scott: You know for many reasons like it won't bring the systems down and they can test things out and if there is a bug they expose fewer users to it to decrease people being upset and it's easy to roll back and undo because you got both things up at the same time and working simultaneously, right

448
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:16,370
Rym: but

449
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:23,460
Scott: It's much better for the users If you find some way for them to be like, you know Like a good a good example of the right way to do.

450
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,285
Scott: is you stream right?

451
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:28,460
Scott: you streams like hey Try our beta show page if you want and it's like.

452
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,951
Scott: you can click beta show page to use the newer better page at any Time.

453
00:25:32,453 --> 00:25:33,617
Scott: but most are good.

454
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:37,050
Scott: YouTube with HTML 5. you want to use YouTube HTML 5 go for it, right?

455
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,209
Scott: But we're not switching everyone over and so it's like they put it out there.

456
00:25:40,551 --> 00:25:49,765
Scott: Anyone who wants to use it can use it and anyone who doesn't know where doesn't care doesn't and that's the better way to roll Out I think because it makes it accessible to everyone who wants it immediately.

457
00:25:49,785 --> 00:25:51,150
Scott: They don't have to wait, right?

458
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:52,877
Scott: They're not saying where the hell's the new Twitter?

459
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:53,962
Scott: Where's the hell this new feature?

460
00:25:54,243 --> 00:26:00,890
Scott: Everyone's got the new feature right now, but You know You can still get the same effect of rolling it out slowly.

461
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:03,829
Scott: We're instead of having everyone in the world use it immediately and then it goes down.

462
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:10,890
Rym: So things to watch for with this to see where this is gonna go is How quickly they roll it out and how quickly it gets spanned to fuck?

463
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:17,430
Rym: Yeah, those two factors will determine whether or not this exceeds how quickly people stop, you know using you know more.

464
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:21,530
Scott: How much more do they stop using their other communication things?

465
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,441
Rym: Yeah, because I've noticed this trend among even the front row crew.

466
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:25,947
Rym: We're gonna our personal group of friends.

467
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:35,582
Rym: in college I used ICQ and about half of us use that and the other half of the school used aim and Eventually aim won out for various reasons and then I see cute ICQ died.

468
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:37,609
Scott: Yeah, Google Talk came in.

469
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:44,378
Scott: So now it's like half Google Talk half aim and even though a bunch of people have gone over to Google Talk There's still a bunch of aim which is

470
00:26:44,498 --> 00:26:53,250
Rym: but even worse a lot of the people I know Who are otherwise really techie cool smart people just aren't ever online in any sort of I am system anymore.

471
00:26:53,471 --> 00:26:54,033
Scott: Yeah, people have.

472
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:55,438
Scott: basically I am is almost dead.

473
00:26:55,458 --> 00:27:00,095
Scott: It's like people just use Facebook and that's it Which is interesting.

474
00:27:00,155 --> 00:27:00,658
Rym: check

475
00:27:00,678 --> 00:27:01,320
Scott: their emails

476
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:24,130
Rym: because the way I used instant messaging The only reason it aimed worked was because my computer was always on But with ICQ the only difference really that mattered in this context was that you could send a message and it would be delivered once Someone came online if they weren't online Automatically, so as a result, it was like time bit like you could talk to someone But if they weren't there you could just send them a message.

477
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,798
Rym: Anyway, you'd know they would get it eventually.

478
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:29,394
Rym: and it was kind of this, you know on demand You can talk when you want.

479
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:36,177
Rym: conversations will start and stop over the course of a day and I am as we have it now Doesn't do that very well actually.

480
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:39,550
Rym: Yeah and Facebook and things like it do that much better.

481
00:27:40,012 --> 00:27:44,170
Rym: But Facebook is the stupid walled garden problem and Twitter is the wrong tool for that.

482
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:50,182
Scott: Yeah, and the problem is is that you know Even if you could make something that was a much better I am in.

483
00:27:50,222 --> 00:27:51,829
Scott: tool like you just made the perfect.

484
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:52,110
Scott: I am.

485
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:52,738
Rym: Oh, it's great.

486
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:53,649
Rym: And I'm the only one on it.

487
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,360
Scott: Yeah No one's gonna use it because you don't have the it's.

488
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,855
Scott: the thing is because face it's the same sort of situation We're having a Facebook.

489
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:09,390
Scott: now is the problem we had with Windows in 1995. right Windows was so dominant that anything they attached to Windows immediately got all these people on it.

490
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:14,768
Scott: AOL being on the Windows desktop just was like boom IE being the built into Windows.

491
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:16,510
Scott: boom It made IE an instant success.

492
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:21,938
Scott: So now because everyone's on Facebook because it's Facebook Facebook is just anything they put on.

493
00:28:21,998 --> 00:28:25,330
Scott: Facebook is also but it wins because it's on the Facebooks, right?

494
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:31,928
Scott: And it's it's really hard for anything that isn't on the Facebooks to have any sort of competitions really.

495
00:28:31,968 --> 00:28:32,490
Scott: and the Twitter?

496
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,104
Scott: You know Twitter came out and went.

497
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:37,497
Scott: oh four 707 was Twitter, right?

498
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:41,116
Scott: So even though Facebook was older than that It was still.

499
00:28:41,157 --> 00:28:43,409
Scott: Facebook was not as dominant as it is now.

500
00:28:43,642 --> 00:28:47,043
Rym: Well I think what the next thing is going to be at least the thing for us.

501
00:28:47,063 --> 00:29:01,025
Rym: the thing that'll actually change things will be when people start seriously making ways of Integrating and aggregating things from all these walled gardens to where I can have my one thing But that's the thing is every walled garden is smart enough to have openness.

502
00:29:01,145 --> 00:29:16,410
Scott: in terms of you know You can build on our platform in a way that benefits us by building on our platform But you cannot build on our platform and they limit it in this very smart ways to prevent you from basically Taking all your information out of their platform and dumping them, right?

503
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,708
Scott: So for example if Facebook let you you know, and this is what the Facebook Google fight was about recently.

504
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:22,170
Scott: Do you see that?

505
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:35,310
Scott: Yeah, basically Facebook had a thing like hey find friends using your Google contacts and Google was like, alright We're not gonna let you use our Google time contacts information anymore Unless you start giving us your Facebook information, right?

506
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:35,973
Scott: It's only fair.

507
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:39,349
Scott: and Facebook was like, alright stop, you know and they're like.

508
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:56,270
Scott: We'll just set this different page up where people are Instructed to download their Google contacts and then upload them to Facebook on one easy to do page and Google basically said alright You can do that But we're gonna put a big old message that tells the user is like hey Are you sure you want to download your Google contacts and send them to Facebook?

509
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,968
Scott: Cuz they're not gonna let you export your contacts ever again.

510
00:30:00,152 --> 00:30:03,490
Scott: Cuz what could happen is if Facebook let you export that stuff, right?

511
00:30:04,111 --> 00:30:04,434
Scott: Like let you.

512
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,310
Scott: if Facebook let you export your data.

513
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:10,690
Scott: I could set up a social networking site tomorrow where you would sign in with Facebook Connect.

514
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:16,293
Scott: it would export all your Facebook data to this other site and you can close your Facebook account and People.

515
00:30:16,434 --> 00:30:23,728
Scott: I'd actually have a pretty significant chance if I was able to Copy all those features of Facebook of people jumping ship or what I would do.

516
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:27,441
Rym: much more I guess more practical as in I think this will actually happen.

517
00:30:27,802 --> 00:30:39,499
Rym: if you bust in and get integration to work Smart people like us will have our whatever account and it just publishes to all the stupid walled gardens that I have an account in All publishing - is never a problem.

518
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:40,886
Scott: They love information coming in.

519
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:43,158
Scott: Yeah, but I just Come back.

520
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,450
Scott: I don't like that.

521
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:52,210
Rym: I could get a Facebook and have all my stuff just go into Facebook But then you assholes are gonna like message me in Facebook and I'm not gonna get it and I don't want to deal with setting.

522
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:59,970
Scott: Yeah, basically what I've done is I have you know Facebook emails me on occasion and that's the only time I ever look at is if it sends me an email.

523
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:04,270
Scott: So I never checked the Facebook, but I get emails from the Facebook that have links to the Facebook.

524
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:06,110
Rym: I have a hidden shitty Facebook account.

525
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,678
Rym: I only use to look at other people's crap when I need to.

526
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:12,150
Scott: I have a Twitter that sends to a Facebook, right?

527
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,675
Scott: But I you know, I don't actually ever post manually on the Facebook itself.

528
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:25,230
Rym: So whatever so things of the day.

529
00:31:25,932 --> 00:31:27,357
Rym: You know the old myth that it's hot.

530
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:31,110
Rym: you can't swim out of Alcatraz like those people who theoretically escaped couldn't have swum it.

531
00:31:31,714 --> 00:31:32,421
Scott: It's not that far.

532
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:33,450
Scott: Can you see it from the shore?

533
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,734
Rym: It's actually a pretty easy.

534
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:35,819
Scott: you can see it from the shore.

535
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,386
Scott: You get totally swimming like it's not.

536
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:38,330
Rym: it depends.

537
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:39,957
Rym: I mean people deep there.

538
00:31:40,178 --> 00:31:42,348
Scott: listen, there are people who have swum like the English Channel.

539
00:31:42,428 --> 00:31:55,550
Rym: Oh, yeah Distance alone actually is not a big factor in that sort of thing as opposed to you're saying that the waters are Water temperature water roughness and currents actually are the primary issues in trying to do a swim like that.

540
00:31:55,671 --> 00:31:59,390
Scott: Also sharks also sharks, but and octopuses.

541
00:31:59,911 --> 00:32:06,070
Rym: Basically, this is good for anyone who thinks and could I do somehow Alcatraz was impossible or different?

542
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,572
Scott: Jellyfish.

543
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:12,810
Rym: here's a video of a nine-year-old boy swimming from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

544
00:32:13,193 --> 00:32:14,564
Scott: Hey, it was a nine-year-old boy.

545
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:15,310
Scott: Was it a nice day?

546
00:32:16,132 --> 00:32:16,935
Rym: I was kind of choppy.

547
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:17,899
Scott: Is he like prac?

548
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:18,441
Scott: was he like a?

549
00:32:18,862 --> 00:32:21,616
Scott: his parents trained him to swim from early age So he could be the next Michael.

550
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:21,999
Scott: I don't know.

551
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,569
Rym: He said it was real cold.

552
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,326
Scott: Yeah, when did he do this recently, yeah, why didn't he do?

553
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,369
Scott: in the summer Whatever?

554
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,141
Scott: That's all I got.

555
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:37,070
Rym: as I got her I didn't want to use just like one of my college humor cute animals.

556
00:32:37,452 --> 00:32:40,750
Scott: So I had different thing in the day, but I think it might have been thinking they before I do.

557
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:43,549
Rym: There's one guy who swam at seven hundred and thirty seven times.

558
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:47,139
Scott: So anyway, I know this hasn't been a thing of the day before.

559
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:55,122
Scott: basically have you ever had to write a program that That speaks to another, you know computer over a serial port rs-232.

560
00:32:55,162 --> 00:32:55,864
Scott: I have have you.

561
00:32:55,884 --> 00:33:00,501
Scott: yeah Well, basically right whenever you do I've done this before as well.

562
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:02,850
Scott: You you have some community protocol, right?

563
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,018
Scott: This is what the packets are gonna.

564
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:05,709
Scott: maybe you know, this is what it's gonna look like.

565
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:07,230
Scott: This is gonna be the control cat, right?

566
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,273
Rym: You got to agree to that.

567
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:13,537
Scott: all you got to set the baud rate and you got to do both have to agree to it Have some sort of way of negotiating.

568
00:33:13,557 --> 00:33:16,090
Scott: you got to do all this stuff, right and it's not that hard, right?

569
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,778
Scott: I mean, especially on a Unix system.

570
00:33:17,818 --> 00:33:19,607
Scott: It's like you find the file you open the file.

571
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:23,870
Scott: You're right to it You read from it you buffer the incoming data you buffer the outgoing data.

572
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,650
Scott: Maybe you resend you come up with some protocol and you just do it, right?

573
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,968
Scott: But it has a lot of these things that you have to code every single time that are bullshit.

574
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:35,810
Scott: Well Somebody has written a programming language called any serial port.

575
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,818
Scott: he's got any serious any serial port?

576
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:47,150
Scott: calm and it's a serial port programming language and Basically all the things that you do every single time you want to talk over a serial port in your program.

577
00:33:47,835 --> 00:33:49,610
Scott: It basically just provides easy commands to do it.

578
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:55,615
Scott: So for example, if you want to check if a serial port is open or closed if you want to you know Buffer incoming data.

579
00:33:55,635 --> 00:34:04,690
Scott: if you want to convert a string to an array of bytes, you know All this stuff that you do every single time all the time whenever you're doing any program involving serial ports.

580
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:16,579
Scott: It just may as easy to do commands to handle all that shit and it makes writing any program that speaks over serial RS to 232 really really 32 to 32.

581
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:17,763
Scott: It makes it really easy to do.

582
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:19,187
Rym: It's actually not RS.

583
00:34:19,246 --> 00:34:20,130
Rym: It's an actual standard.

584
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,895
Rym: It's no longer a recommended stand whatever.

585
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:26,610
Scott: It makes it really easy to do even if you aren't like a hardcore programmer.

586
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:31,469
Scott: So, you know if you want to like plug some sort of device into your computer on a serial port.

587
00:34:32,952 --> 00:34:34,179
Scott: This will let you talk to it.

588
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,225
Scott: You know, get some Arduino.

589
00:34:35,245 --> 00:34:36,089
Scott: This will work well with that.

590
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:45,800
Rym: Yeah, I remember when I learned all that stuff worked, you know My original computer my 486 sx2 had Documentation for everything including its 2400 baud modem.

591
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:48,750
Scott: The only thing with this is it's sort of Microsoft centric, right?

592
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:53,590
Rym: So yeah, well, I never actually coded anything in Windows.

593
00:34:53,973 --> 00:35:00,770
Rym: I mean whenever I use the serial port in Windows I would basically open hyper terminal and just connect directly and just type direct commands to whatever I was like.

594
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,100
Scott: You look at this feature list.

595
00:35:02,262 --> 00:35:09,150
Scott: It's like yeah You know supports all major Windows platforms redistributable as part of your dotnet application.

596
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:17,114
Scott: So it's a little you know data export file or any ODBC compatible database MSQL oracle access excel dbase, right?

597
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:25,937
Scott: So it's like pretty Microsoft centric, but even so It's a pretty good idea Especially if you're a serial port kind of person.

598
00:35:26,217 --> 00:35:34,768
Rym: serial ports are still actually fairly useful just because of the fact that they're really simple And it's really easy to do physical stuff on the other side.

599
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:50,508
Rym: Yep like it's the the the thresholds of current and voltage for data are real big and The timing is actually really easy to sort out Like coding like making a device that'll just take in USB unless you just buy pre-made stuff.

600
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,070
Rym: Not so easy.

601
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,530
Scott: Actually, this also has an awesome GUI going on.

602
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:55,104
Scott: So, you know, it's really easy.

603
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:58,379
Scott: for normal people Like you'll be shocked how easy this is.

604
00:35:58,479 --> 00:36:02,859
Scott: you are compared to writing it and see which is what I usually do But not the most.

605
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,167
Rym: I use my bod 2400 baud modem for though was connecting to BBS's until eventually I upgraded to a 33 6.

606
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,170
Rym: I use the null modem.

607
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:13,482
Rym: I had a fit to play Doom 2 with my brother.

608
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:27,744
Scott: I had a 14 4 modem, but then I Eventually got a 56 K external USB modem, which I think I still have somewhere the day or maybe I remember trying to explain to My parents why I needed a null modem And then I finally convinced them.

609
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:28,490
Rym: we went to Radio Shack.

610
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:33,789
Rym: We bought it went home and I hooked the two computers up and we played quick and they were actually pretty amazed by that.

611
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:37,724
Rym: Yeah, because there was no internet back then at least not like we have now.

612
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:41,156
Rym: there was dial-up Kind of.

613
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:42,809
Rym: it didn't work that well.

614
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:55,069
Rym: So we might have done shows about things like this in the past, but Especially now with the peer-to-peer battles really heating up a lot of people don't seem to actually understand what the internet is.

615
00:36:57,017 --> 00:36:59,229
Rym: I'd like It's starting to bother me.

616
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,870
Scott: Well, I got the idea to do this show because people didn't know what internet 2 was.

617
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,190
Scott: So we can we got to start before we even talk about what that is.

618
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,818
Scott: We got to start like with the with the beginning.

619
00:37:07,878 --> 00:37:08,903
Rym: I want well ARPANET.

620
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:10,210
Scott: Yeah, why not?

621
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,770
Rym: So I actually I went to the TLDR version and that too is awesome.

622
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,799
Rym: The internet is capitalized because it's a proper.

623
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:20,230
Rym: now the internet capitalized is an internet.

624
00:37:20,712 --> 00:37:25,533
Rym: Yeah, the internet is a collection of networks that are themselves Networked.

625
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:28,386
Scott: Yeah, so a network is just things connected to each other.

626
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:36,110
Scott: It could be two people It could be it doesn't have to be people could be people computers any things that are connected and communicating is a network, right?

627
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:43,767
Scott: but an intranet right lowercase I Unintranet is when you have a network that is closed off.

628
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:52,362
Rym: now Technically, that's just an internal network and intranet usually means that you have multiple networks that are themselves network But they are not connected to anything.

629
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:54,612
Scott: Yes, but that is Pedantry.

630
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,741
Scott: Yes, that is still a network, right?

631
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:58,910
Scott: Yes, you can consider, you know, what's the difference between that be?

632
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:04,970
Scott: You know, okay So I have an office building in New York and have an office building in California and I have an OC 3 going between them.

633
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:06,805
Scott: That's a land and there's a network.

634
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:09,490
Scott: I know It's many things at once.

635
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:17,372
Scott: All right Because on the one hand the network the network in New York is a network and the network in California is a network and they're Connected.

636
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:18,637
Scott: so that's an intranet.

637
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:23,857
Scott: the two networks are now intranet worked but at the same time Both of them together are connected.

638
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:25,343
Scott: So the whole thing is a network.

639
00:38:25,563 --> 00:38:28,876
Rym: now if you want to get into the real Pedantic bullshit details.

640
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:32,349
Rym: It also matters as to whether or not they share namespaces and IP spaces.

641
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:38,470
Scott: Yeah, and what if the new and if the New York office is split between like the the sales staff and the tech staff?

642
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,330
Scott: Well, that's an intranet because you've split them into two, you know.

643
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:50,563
Rym: Or if you've got multiple like a lot of good production IT environments You have multiple completely separate segregated networks Like you have the main interface network that everything connects to.

644
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,210
Rym: that's how you're like SSH into your servers.

645
00:38:52,654 --> 00:38:54,470
Rym: And then you've got the monitoring backplane.

646
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:59,550
Rym: Maybe you've got even a second backplane that is just for like data transfers or just for backups.

647
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:00,246
Rym: Mm-hmm.

648
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:08,525
Rym: Actually, I didn't bother with that here because now that Scott I don't live in the same place and it's just me and Emily And now that everything's just gigabit doesn't really matter.

649
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:14,349
Rym: but back in the day I was thinking about making a separate network in the house just for internal data transfers.

650
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:16,416
Rym: Yeah, not so important now.

651
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:17,298
Scott: No, not important.

652
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:21,370
Scott: No, actually I transferred something by gigabit over to my HD PC the other day.

653
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,790
Scott: Yeah, it took five minutes like a whole bunch of gigs.

654
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:27,040
Rym: Anyway, I gotta make an HD PC.

655
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,270
Rym: I'm that Mac Mac's not holding up anymore.

656
00:39:29,391 --> 00:39:31,990
Rym: No, but anyway, what's real important here?

657
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:39,030
Rym: I really want people to remember this internet is capitalized because the internet is very very different from an internet.

658
00:39:39,312 --> 00:39:40,840
Scott: Yeah on internet is.

659
00:39:41,202 --> 00:39:42,530
Scott: you know net is?

660
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:46,870
Scott: Inter-networked networks, right it can form on internet.

661
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:53,530
Scott: There are can be many internets, you know, but there is only one capital I internet which is the internet.

662
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:57,550
Rym: However, there is the internet too, which is not itself.

663
00:39:57,671 --> 00:40:07,310
Rym: that name does not specify an Internet so much as it specifies a consortium of people who together have created an alternate high-speed future backbone.

664
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:09,897
Scott: Yes, but it is on internet.

665
00:40:10,178 --> 00:40:11,421
Scott: in lower the internet too.

666
00:40:11,782 --> 00:40:14,610
Scott: is that network that they have created is on internet?

667
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:16,158
Scott: Yes, but it is not the internet.

668
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:17,103
Rym: But what is another?

669
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:21,258
Rym: it is, however, not Necessarily separate from the real internet.

670
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:22,883
Rym: In fact, it's a part of the internet.

671
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:25,330
Rym: It's just your packets aren't routing over it.

672
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:26,055
Scott: That's right.

673
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,010
Rym: Most of the time basically, right?

674
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,766
Scott: So imagine if you know I got.

675
00:40:29,947 --> 00:40:30,812
Scott: you know I'm on.

676
00:40:30,892 --> 00:40:36,690
Scott: I got a cable modem right and rims got cable modem and we're both on the internet right via our cable modems.

677
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:38,816
Scott: But I toss a cable over to rims house.

678
00:40:39,077 --> 00:40:44,615
Scott: Okay, so now our houses are connected to each other and we're violating numerous local statutes Probably but whatever.

679
00:40:45,298 --> 00:40:54,432
Scott: so I set up my router to say hey router Yeah if anything is you know going to Rym send it over this wire instead of the internet wire and then Rym does the same thing on His end.

680
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:58,594
Scott: and now that's basically what internet too is like, you know It's you.

681
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:04,190
Scott: I won't even notice if my packets are going over the you know This the the special Rym wire or the other wire.

682
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:08,127
Scott: They might actually go over the Rym wire and then be routed over to the internet.

683
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,421
Scott: if you know Who knows what's gonna happen with the routing.

684
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:11,608
Scott: the point is?

685
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,055
Scott: That's what internet 2 is like it's?

686
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:18,370
Scott: you don't even notice that you're using internet 2 or using internet 1.

687
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:24,811
Scott: It's just your packets get routed over the better internet 2 wires if you are on internet 2.

688
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:26,809
Scott: So if you're at a college that's an internet 2 connection.

689
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:33,359
Scott: If you visit like say MIT dot edu Your packets are probably going to be going over internet 2 wires.

690
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:37,632
Rym: is now internet 1 wires the tldr version of that or tldl is that?

691
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:45,910
Rym: most of what is on that internet is Pornography where's and various copyright violations.

692
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:52,393
Scott: There is a lot of that going on in internet 2 because someone's sitting in their dorm room at one college as some peer-to-peer Application.

693
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:55,948
Scott: by the way, I found out what the new hot peer-to-peer application is.

694
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:57,634
Scott: Yeah The torrent.

695
00:41:57,714 --> 00:41:58,537
Scott: no, it's something else.

696
00:41:58,818 --> 00:42:05,142
Scott: so and then someone else will be seeing a different college and they'll both load up You know, I guess the modern equivalent direct connector.

697
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:14,250
Scott: if they're still using direct connect that even though Oh my god Or even bit torrent and reconnect flashbacks to RIT and they'll both start a torrent and all those packets like a router.

698
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:17,564
Scott: No for internet - because they're both on internet - and it'll be really fast.

699
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:18,789
Scott: That's just how it works.

700
00:42:19,712 --> 00:42:25,094
Scott: But at the same time like if you want to download an ISO of like a Linux distribution I'll take you like two seconds.

701
00:42:25,556 --> 00:42:29,850
Rym: The best part about internet - was just that it was it's kind of a self-selected internet.

702
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:36,192
Rym: It can be more advanced than the normal internet because smart people are trying out better ways of doing backbone Infrastructure.

703
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:41,249
Rym: because remember the internet with a capital I is just a bunch of networks that are connected like level 3.

704
00:42:41,249 --> 00:42:42,869
Scott: Yeah Basically, what's cool?

705
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:48,885
Scott: so what's going on here is you can't like Practice out or do experiments on the real internet because it's the real internet.

706
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:52,509
Scott: if you mess up your experiment You're gonna disrupt service for a whole bunch of people.

707
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:57,310
Scott: But if internet to service gets disrupted even the people at the college won't be that my wares.

708
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,205
Rym: I'll have to connect to the local direct connect.

709
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:01,373
Rym: that only has The collect.

710
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:08,882
Scott: I can't use internet - I'll have to use the internet and my counter-strike ping to California went up from one Millisecond to two milliseconds.

711
00:43:08,943 --> 00:43:09,910
Scott: Yeah, it's not a bit right.

712
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,184
Rym: So what they do on internet - is actually I think six is about as good as you could.

713
00:43:13,204 --> 00:43:17,053
Scott: possibly the reason it's so fast Is because they're constantly Experimenting on it.

714
00:43:17,093 --> 00:43:24,049
Scott: if you want to do research on you know internet working, you know You do it on internet - at some school and in the in the.

715
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:28,567
Scott: you know The IT department and you can practice and you can set up new lines.

716
00:43:28,627 --> 00:43:33,210
Rym: and like one example You can try out some IP v6 before the IP 6 v6 rollout.

717
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:42,130
Rym: I personally applied for and got a Gigantic chunk of the six bone which was like the testing network for IP v6 to do a project for a class that I then dropped.

718
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:44,366
Rym: eventually that expired.

719
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:53,910
Scott: The point is is that you know, it's a play internet - is I had a partner I don't know ever happened to his project internet - is a place where you know or magical things happen.

720
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,237
Scott: You can do that sort of thing.

721
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,870
Rym: It doesn't matter with no ping.

722
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:04,434
Rym: Yeah, all right He had an OC 3 that was for the internet - and then an RC 3 just for the internet and that was back in 2000.

723
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:05,682
Rym: I can't imagine what they have now.

724
00:44:05,702 --> 00:44:06,507
Scott: I have no idea.

725
00:44:08,032 --> 00:44:09,989
Scott: Well that I thought we would have a lot more to say on this.

726
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:12,481
Rym: Well, I do have a lot more to say because the internet.

727
00:44:12,661 --> 00:44:16,230
Rym: this is why I don't want to harp on net neutrality But this is why net neutrality is so important.

728
00:44:16,852 --> 00:44:17,314
Scott: The internet

729
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:30,580
Rym: was originally designed partly as a military and science application to be a network That was robust that it would route around trouble that everything is kind of connected to everything else and you can send data and it Gets there without having a direct wire to get there.

730
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:32,608
Scott: Yeah, like, you know, oh this wire broke.

731
00:44:32,648 --> 00:44:35,950
Scott: Well, it's good We got other wires because it's a big web of wires all over the place.

732
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,740
Scott: Yep, as long as it's a path from A to B It doesn't matter what that path is.

733
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,303
Scott: as long as we can find some way to complete it Even if it goes all the way around the world to get there.

734
00:44:43,606 --> 00:44:44,130
Scott: We'll get there.

735
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:47,770
Rym: But there's actually not that much redundancy in the modern internet.

736
00:44:48,131 --> 00:44:51,981
Scott: Yeah, the biggest problem is that because everyone has ISPs, right?

737
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:55,370
Scott: There's all these single points of failure for large chunks, right?

738
00:44:55,610 --> 00:45:00,230
Scott: So if your ISP goes down and they say, you know, you're done, right?

739
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:06,933
Scott: that was you have this one's focal wire that is carrying all the traffic of Cablevision or Time Warner or Comcast.

740
00:45:07,576 --> 00:45:11,050
Scott: so and on top of that right you have another problem, which is okay.

741
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,630
Scott: I have a data center and I know I can't have a single point of failure.

742
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,270
Scott: So I've got ten different wires coming in here, right?

743
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:27,369
Scott: But at some point, you know some guy out there right if he wants to get to any of those ten wires He's got to find a wire going to your town and all the wires going to your town go through sprint link or whatever.

744
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:33,750
Scott: some You know huge backbone like that and those backbones luckily are really good at staying up.

745
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:35,678
Scott: But they've had a major problem in a while.

746
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,430
Rym: I've actually I dealt with a major problem last week.

747
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:44,590
Rym: I won't name names or anything, but a major provider had a gigantic fire in a tunnel filled with fiber.

748
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,109
Scott: Oh, gee, I can't guess who that would be and it sucked ass.

749
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:51,430
Scott: But that was a local NYC thing right the big backbone.

750
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:56,044
Rym: No that actually broke connectivity between an NYC thing and a Virginia thing.

751
00:45:56,264 --> 00:45:58,150
Scott: Wow, it's really big.

752
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:03,470
Scott: But I'm saying is that it wasn't like a fire between you know, how many times the great old ones fight?

753
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,886
Rym: There will be gods fighting meaning two level.

754
00:46:05,906 --> 00:46:11,170
Rym: two ISPs Will have some sort of bitch fight with each other and then the internet just gets disrupted.

755
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:11,890
Scott: That's true.

756
00:46:12,392 --> 00:46:19,075
Rym: And if there was actually like a major national disaster like if New York City got nuked or something crazy half the internet's just gonna Stop working.

757
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:24,321
Rym: That's also true and I feel like we need more redundancy.

758
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:28,402
Rym: We need we need to get to the new, you know People always talked about web 2.0.

759
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:29,850
Rym: We need to get to web 3.0.

760
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:41,650
Rym: We need to get to a world or web 10.0 Where every single device is connected to as many other devices as possible wirelessly ad hoc Like you've got to have like 10 layers of redundancy.

761
00:46:42,254 --> 00:46:44,550
Rym: Imagine if we had a world where I've got my wire ISP, right?

762
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:46,614
Rym: Mm-hmm and independently.

763
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:59,302
Rym: maybe I've got the power line connection that anyone can just connect to it slow as shit But it's there and the government maintains it or something or you pay a small fee to have access to it And maybe there's municipal Wi-Fi and I'm also connected to that

764
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:00,185
Scott: and maybe

765
00:47:00,205 --> 00:47:01,369
Rym: I could pay for another Wi-Fi.

766
00:47:01,891 --> 00:47:10,110
Rym: I want to have as many ways of connecting to people as possible such that Everyone is publishing and consuming at about equal rates all the time.

767
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:11,013
Scott: well, that's another problem.

768
00:47:11,074 --> 00:47:13,302
Scott: right is because they're still in IPv4.

769
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:19,244
Scott: right publishing is difficult because You need an IP address and there's not so many of them.

770
00:47:19,284 --> 00:47:20,550
Scott: So you have to get a hosting company.

771
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:21,031
Rym: I would argue.

772
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:29,999
Rym: it's also difficult because the there is a vested interest in many multimedia conglomerates in preventing Individual people from having publishing parity.

773
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:32,046
Scott: Well, also every hosting company in the world, right?

774
00:47:32,066 --> 00:47:33,110
Scott: They want you to buy hosting.

775
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:36,248
Scott: They don't want you to turn on a computer in your house and have that be.

776
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:38,218
Scott: you know As good as the data with my files.

777
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:40,630
Rym: I could pretty much host GeekNights here.

778
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:45,126
Scott: Yeah, there are some people who have good internet connections and they totally do it and that's the way it should be.

779
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:47,469
Rym: and imagine if Everyone did that.

780
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,013
Scott: Yeah You didn't know one.

781
00:47:49,174 --> 00:47:56,145
Scott: every hosting company went out of business and anyone who wanted a website just turned a computer on in their House or even better and left it on all the time and their website was.

782
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,190
Rym: we've talked about this before.

783
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:01,806
Rym: Imagine a world where your web browser is also a web server operas doing that.

784
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:04,271
Rym: Yeah, but it's not There.

785
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:07,470
Scott: no for obvious reason, but as soon as you got a pv6, right?

786
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:10,549
Scott: They won't be able to stop you from having a static IP address, right?

787
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:11,152
Scott: You're gonna.

788
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:11,976
Scott: so you're gonna.

789
00:48:12,076 --> 00:48:22,670
Scott: you know, the DNS the problem will be solved You know, you'll be able to just have you know Whatever calm point at your house where your computers are and your stuff will be running there and it'll be all good.

790
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:24,822
Scott: all right, you wanted to pay for hosting.

791
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:28,161
Scott: all the hosting companies be gone and You know, you'll you'll.

792
00:48:28,201 --> 00:48:28,949
Scott: it'll be totally awesome.

793
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:32,963
Rym: Well, let's talk a little bit about the World Wide Web because we've done a show on.

794
00:48:33,003 --> 00:48:36,375
Scott: the World Wide Web is not the internet It's not on internet.

795
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:41,378
Rym: It's not an intranet and it's not internet - it's a Gillette and Michael Godot I know I argued with you about this.

796
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:42,343
Rym: You guys are still wrong.

797
00:48:42,383 --> 00:48:43,710
Scott: Well, that was a DNS argument.

798
00:48:43,972 --> 00:48:48,334
Rym: Yeah, but then I they I argued with them about Www and they didn't know what it meant.

799
00:48:48,354 --> 00:48:53,267
Rym: and then they they I have the studio World Wide Web is specifically right.

800
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:55,452
Scott: just pretty much HTTP.

801
00:48:55,693 --> 00:48:58,982
Scott: HTTP is the World Wide Web and what it is.

802
00:48:59,323 --> 00:49:02,110
Scott: people have set up HTTP servers.

803
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:15,346
Scott: These are servers that speak the hypertext transfer protocol and like, you know Apache is the most popular HTTP server in the world, right and So you if you run an HTTP server that server is not part of the web.

804
00:49:15,767 --> 00:49:30,978
Scott: and basically because every HTTP server can be reached via a URL you can create links and people can click a link while they're looking at a page that is served by one server and they'll then their Browser will request a page from another server.

805
00:49:31,018 --> 00:49:32,382
Scott: So from the user's perspective.

806
00:49:32,442 --> 00:49:40,207
Scott: It looks like there's this connected web of Pages all served by different servers all in different places around the world.

807
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:47,990
Rym: conceptually I mean the internet physically and conceptually is a web of devices that are all interconnected and there's multiple redundant paths to places.

808
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:51,606
Rym: You know in theory, yep, the World Wide Web is just a meta structure.

809
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:55,201
Scott: on top of that It's not even you know on the hardware level.

810
00:49:55,262 --> 00:49:57,029
Scott: The World Wide Web is not even a web.

811
00:49:57,552 --> 00:50:00,990
Scott: It's pretty much just all these individual points that are you know?

812
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:09,110
Scott: Not connected except for the fact that their content that is served at each of those points Refers to content that is served on other points.

813
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:14,870
Rym: But the beauty of this is that the World Wide Web is nothing more than a meta construct an abstract a protocol.

814
00:50:15,533 --> 00:50:20,116
Rym: You could have any underlying physical infrastructure It doesn't matter.

815
00:50:20,136 --> 00:50:31,805
Rym: and furthermore because the original World Wide Web was Designed really for making pages where words linked to other pages about things It was also designed right to where anyone could edit any page right.

816
00:50:31,826 --> 00:50:34,315
Scott: your HTTP It's it's plus it's.

817
00:50:34,455 --> 00:50:35,298
Scott: but what put?

818
00:50:35,418 --> 00:50:37,485
Scott: post yeah and delete right.

819
00:50:37,526 --> 00:50:38,850
Scott: those are the four major command.

820
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,998
Rym: You're pretty much getting 99% of the time.

821
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,990
Scott: pretty much everyone gets nobody really ever.

822
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:46,989
Scott: You know you post when you submit a form right.

823
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:48,516
Rym: well I think this is just a matter of you.

824
00:50:48,556 --> 00:50:50,424
Scott: don't really delete or put anything.

825
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:55,350
Rym: Tim Berners-Lee and all the other Geniuses involved in this just were far too forward-thinking.

826
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:57,396
Rym: Yeah I mean we're way ahead of their time.

827
00:50:57,456 --> 00:51:07,748
Scott: if what their original vision of the World Wide Web had come to be would basically be Every do basically everything would be Wikipedia everything and even probably even better than Wikipedia.

828
00:51:07,848 --> 00:51:08,490
Rym: That would be awesome.

829
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:13,449
Scott: It would be like everyone edit every page everywhere, and that is what the original vision of the web was.

830
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:15,206
Scott: But that's not what it turned out to be.

831
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:16,978
Rym: yep And there are other you know.

832
00:51:16,998 --> 00:51:21,990
Rym: we could go into detail there where we won't but basically The World Wide Web is a meta construct.

833
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:25,310
Rym: And I think that's important because what was the primary tenant of the World Wide Web?

834
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:36,810
Rym: even if we ignore the fact that we don't have the editing everywhere that you link directly to relevant information and Just by the course of humans the core create useful neural networks of information.

835
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:41,827
Scott: yeah, the core of the web really it was the hypertext right that you could have text that links to other text.

836
00:51:41,847 --> 00:51:42,750
Scott: right HTTP.

837
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,157
Scott: and That's what we got.

838
00:51:45,217 --> 00:51:46,607
Scott: we got text that links to other text.

839
00:51:46,748 --> 00:51:47,010
Rym: oh no.

840
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:49,457
Rym: But now we've got flash that you can't link directly into.

841
00:51:49,477 --> 00:51:51,423
Rym: oh we've got people blocking links.

842
00:51:51,624 --> 00:51:53,449
Rym: You can't hotlink and embed shit.

843
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:58,530
Scott: Yeah, regardless the web right or the World Wide Web really only refers to web pages.

844
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,889
Scott: It doesn't refer to anything else, so if you think about it, right?

845
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:09,533
Scott: The internet also includes pretty much everything else right bit torrents IRC I am Email every.

846
00:52:09,553 --> 00:52:11,999
Scott: there are tons and tons of internet applications.

847
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,030
Scott: right things that you do on the internets that are not the web.

848
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:27,603
Scott: they're not web pages you know and People don't seem to think about those things a lot And I think part of it is because they do a lot of things through a web interface Which is fine, or you know when they're not using the browser.

849
00:52:27,623 --> 00:52:29,710
Scott: They don't realize that they're using the internet.

850
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:33,750
Scott: Internet is the browser and plus I mean it's called Internet Explorer.

851
00:52:33,892 --> 00:52:37,781
Scott: It's you know but Internet Explorer Actually can sort of you can go on FTP.

852
00:52:37,942 --> 00:52:39,529
Scott: it can do a lot of things that are not HTTP.

853
00:52:40,172 --> 00:52:41,921
Scott: So it is actually sort of an accurate name.

854
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:42,986
Scott: It is an Internet Explorer.

855
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:43,810
Rym: Well there was gopher.

856
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,415
Scott: Gopher was also dead now.

857
00:52:46,435 --> 00:52:47,758
Scott: Yeah, you know it was.

858
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:50,826
Scott: it was similar to HTTP kind of well anyway that.

859
00:52:51,027 --> 00:52:54,830
Rym: but going back to the Web thing because you know we've made all these advances.

860
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,329
Rym: We're doing all these things on the internet other than the web.

861
00:52:57,731 --> 00:53:08,370
Rym: but if we just consider the web we have achieved and realized maybe 1% of the true potential of just text only hypertext like that alone.

862
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:10,940
Rym: We have achieved so little of what is possible with that.

863
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:16,942
Rym: all of our laws are not just there interlinked Yep, all of our public policy all the all of our tech.

864
00:53:16,962 --> 00:53:17,042
Rym: well.

865
00:53:17,062 --> 00:53:19,170
Scott: It's just that's just a situation of data, right?

866
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,638
Scott: I mean technologically we've pushed it to the limits.

867
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,380
Scott: It's just data.

868
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,370
Scott: wise you know we haven't gotten all the data up there.

869
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,845
Scott: You know and that's what we built this conceptual.

870
00:53:28,006 --> 00:53:31,690
Scott: a lot of the data That's been up there has been closed off and you know various.

871
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:36,410
Rym: We built a conceptual lattice and we started putting stuff in it And then we were distracted by shiny stuff.

872
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:41,190
Rym: And we've got this perfectly good lattice that could change the world and we're gonna change the world.

873
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:42,496
Scott: But it's only changed the world.

874
00:53:42,516 --> 00:53:45,086
Scott: and the thing is like it can change the world.

875
00:53:45,147 --> 00:53:48,362
Scott: so much right It's like it's only changed the world maybe 10% of what it could.

876
00:53:48,624 --> 00:53:49,910
Scott: but that 10% is gigantic.

877
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,959
Scott: That's like oh, it's 10% of a Jillian.

878
00:53:52,341 --> 00:53:58,001
Scott: so we got 1/10 of a Jillian changes Gigantic ginormous change, I know you hate ginormous.

879
00:53:58,062 --> 00:54:01,903
Rym: I hate that word so much, but We have the word enormous.

880
00:54:02,044 --> 00:54:02,950
Scott: we have the word gigantic.

881
00:54:03,171 --> 00:54:06,144
Scott: We could have a 10 times as much ginormous.

882
00:54:06,164 --> 00:54:07,470
Rym: a change is you know?

883
00:54:07,931 --> 00:54:09,682
Rym: Where does ginormous fit in the scale?

884
00:54:09,722 --> 00:54:11,010
Rym: is it bigger than gargantuan?

885
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,216
