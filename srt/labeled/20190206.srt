1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,438
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 6th, 2019.

2
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:12,381
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:14,526
Scott: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:17,709
Rym: We review spider-man into the spider-verse.

5
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:26,316
Rym: Let's do this So, uh in case you didn't notice Or are a complete tool.

6
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:33,958
Rym: global warming is kind of a problem like we got to do something about being climate change climate change Which is which is effectively global warming.

7
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,921
Rym: Mm-hmm Good like hey, no, it's pretty much never good.

8
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,105
Rym: We don't want to change the climate.

9
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:43,470
Scott: It's good if it's warm.

10
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:44,576
Rym: It's good in New York.

11
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:46,707
Rym: It is good in the Lewis blackaway.

12
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:47,250
Scott: That's right.

13
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:48,713
Scott: Exactly, right.

14
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:53,090
Scott: and for me, they'll be less if it the entire world on average gets warmer.

15
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:54,679
Scott: I don't care about those in the world.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,450
Scott: New York will be warmer more often.

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:03,439
Scott: I can go outside more often snowed on less off until New York starts having malaria and bedbugs That will be bedbugs.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,390
Scott: I mean that hasn't happened yet.

19
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:10,910
Rym: So I'll put it this way that thinking is obviously a joke, but that thinking is the same thing.

20
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:11,494
Rym: You know what?

21
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:12,341
Rym: The same thinking is.

22
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:13,410
Rym: it's the same thing.

23
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,370
Scott: It's a joke when I say it, but this problem is other people say and they're not joking and they're just morons.

24
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:19,189
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

25
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:25,750
Rym: It's the same as I both do not want people to be hurt by tornadoes and fucking love tornadoes.

26
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:37,710
Rym: so if a tornado happens and I did not cause that tornado I can enjoy the existence of the tornado with Independent of the fact that I am sad people are in the path of that tornado.

27
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:40,199
Rym: Mmm, like I didn't make the tornado happen.

28
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:42,970
Rym: if I did there's a whole other problem going on.

29
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:47,529
Rym: So I skied this weekend right top man.

30
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:52,810
Rym: Yeah, so I skied this weekend and we'll put the flute away link two hours from where I live.

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,909
Rym: I went skiing and it was negative six degrees while I was skiing Fahrenheit woman like.

32
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,499
Rym: so I ski like I like winter sports.

33
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:03,426
Scott: What is negative six F and C?

34
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:07,460
Rym: It's It's just F. Negative six.

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,169
Rym: C is F you.

36
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:10,656
Rym: So negative six.

37
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:22,730
Rym: F is the equivalent of literally if any skin one square Centimeter of your skin is not covered by something for you for you international people who are like saltwater freezes.

38
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:24,357
Scott: Negative six.

39
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:27,829
Scott: Fahrenheit is negative 521 Celsius.

40
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:29,834
Rym: That means that salt water.

41
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:32,462
Rym: you put salt out to prevent ice from happening.

42
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:35,391
Rym: The salt will be frozen in the ice Mm-hmm.

43
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:36,355
Rym: That's what it's.

44
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,619
Rym: so I went skiing.

45
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:40,630
Rym: It was negative six when I started skiing that morning.

46
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,990
Scott: Well, I guess it must have been some great skiing cuz everything snow was gonna melt.

47
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,236
Rym: It was and every was too cold.

48
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:47,218
Rym: No one else was skiing.

49
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:48,120
Rym: So the mountain myself.

50
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:49,865
Rym: Yeah by the afternoon.

51
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,909
Rym: It was 35 degrees F.

52
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:55,256
Scott: Let's add that snows gonna melt yo.

53
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:57,161
Scott: Well, thank you slowly.

54
00:02:57,282 --> 00:02:58,304
Scott: It's a little bit above.

55
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:00,290
Scott: It's like single-digit Celsius.

56
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:13,861
Rym: I mean, I don't want to get into the nuances of skiing But 35 is actually pretty good skiing weather for reasons, but just don't let's not derail here a Couple days later as in yesterday, so I skied on Saturday.

57
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:15,566
Rym: yesterday was what Monday.

58
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:17,293
Scott: yesterday was Tuesday.

59
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:17,698
Scott: Wednesday.

60
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,154
Scott: Today is Wednesday Today's Wednesday.

61
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:25,282
Scott: Yeah, it's a Wednesday podcast.

62
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:27,128
Rym: I originally said Thursday and it was now.

63
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:27,450
Rym: take.

64
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:29,129
Rym: Okay, I'm a little tired.

65
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:35,506
Rym: So I went running last night in shorts and a t-shirt because it was like 60 degrees.

66
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:37,130
Scott: It was like 58 59.

67
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,855
Rym: Yeah, it was in the it was near 60.

68
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:44,030
Rym: So the thing is for me that's still cold and for me that is running shirtless.

69
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:47,829
Scott: It's like obviously much much warmer and more comfortable than negative six.

70
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:49,958
Scott: I will gladly take it over negative six.

71
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:51,967
Scott: I'm not complaining but it's still cold.

72
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:52,589
Scott: I need to be one.

73
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:53,593
Rym: Scott You have gotten weak.

74
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:55,060
Rym: I remember weird RIT.

75
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,470
Scott: Let's remove all your hair and we'll see what you think.

76
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:57,852
Rym: Oh true.

77
00:03:57,953 --> 00:03:59,060
Rym: We both had hair back then.

78
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:07,078
Rym: now only one of us has hair At least on the top bit, but I remember in those days and RIT I just transplant all my not my bottom hair to my top.

79
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,628
Rym: if it hit 50 degrees Fahrenheit shorts weather Like the Sun is out.

80
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:22,308
Rym: so anyway So a thing about skiing is that ski resorts have to tell you the snow conditions the snow report.

81
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:22,890
Rym: that's the thing.

82
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:24,415
Scott: Yeah, it's not like ice skating.

83
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:25,740
Scott: We can go ice skating in the summer.

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,470
Scott: Yeah, it's like there's a. you know, we're swimming pool.

85
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,496
Scott: That's always just one.

86
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,750
Rym: like if you're gonna go out on the ocean.

87
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:36,342
Rym: Yeah Like when we were in you gotta check the bacteria the tides the waves.

88
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,870
Rym: when we were in Australia the hotel gave us a report.

89
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,778
Rym: That's like here's the tides for today.

90
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:42,164
Rym: Here's the weather conditions.

91
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:44,452
Rym: Here's the storm that's coming Etc.

92
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:45,616
Rym: So skiing is the same thing.

93
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:53,799
Rym: You can every snow mountain will have a report the snow report, but the thing is Ski resorts never want to tell you shit sucks.

94
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,380
Rym: Don't come.

95
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,162
Rym: Yep.

96
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:58,150
Scott: So there's actually since they're seasonal, right?

97
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,877
Scott: It's like all summer shit sucks.

98
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:00,460
Scott: Don't come.

99
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:02,870
Scott: so except unless it's a super tall mountain or something.

100
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,318
Rym: So luckily there are some standards so people they will.

101
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:14,849
Rym: there are names of particular kinds of conditions and They'll write a bunch of paragraphs that are basically trying to Imply to you that skiing will be great.

102
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:15,534
Scott: Well, don't?

103
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:17,970
Scott: they usually just tell you like the number of open trails?

104
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,730
Scott: And then that is like that is enough to go on because the trails are always open.

105
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:24,503
Scott: Oh, they open them even if there's like just grass there.

106
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:27,596
Rym: Well, no if there's snow on it It'll be open but that snow might be.

107
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:28,920
Rym: there's many kinds of snow.

108
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,389
Rym: You see for example, solid ice is a kind of snow.

109
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:34,678
Scott: Well, they keep it open with solid ice.

110
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,207
Scott: So sometimes that sounds not good.

111
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:44,025
Scott: one time at Killington I was sounds like you're good trying to get a lawsuit because like you shouldn't have kept you good They you shouldn't have kept that trail open.

112
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:44,670
Scott: It was just deadly.

113
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:48,830
Scott: They won't call it ice, but I digress it was solid ice followed by jagged rocks.

114
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,770
Scott: Why did you keep that trail open one time?

115
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,950
Rym: I was at Mount Killington and I went on a trail called bunny buster, which is like a blue like an intermediate trail.

116
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,149
Rym: It was the end of the day.

117
00:05:57,311 --> 00:06:00,670
Rym: The weather was shitty and I was just like I'm just gonna ski down this one run and I'll be done.

118
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:07,490
Rym: I fell over near the top because it was just solid fucking ice and I slid the entire way down the mountain.

119
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,657
Rym: It was so slippery.

120
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:10,610
Rym: I could not stop myself.

121
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:13,741
Rym: I slid like 3/4 of a mile.

122
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:15,150
Scott: Did you see anyone else sliding?

123
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:22,958
Rym: Uh, no, but I saw a few people who were kind of like near the edge of the trail watching me Debating how they themselves were gonna get down.

124
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:24,686
Scott: Oh, so you're just like alone.

125
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:27,514
Rym: I was alone just Slowly.

126
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:30,247
Rym: people on the other less shitty parts of the mountain.

127
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:34,127
Scott: Okay Everyone else got word that that was not a good.

128
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:36,899
Rym: actually Kate Adam and Emily were with me on this trip.

129
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,324
Scott: Do they go slide down?

130
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:39,730
Rym: that Adam slid down us?

131
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,050
Rym: So I think he actually also slid down buddy buster before me, but we didn't meet up.

132
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:43,372
Rym: He didn't.

133
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:44,298
Rym: I did not see him.

134
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:46,089
Rym: so he could warn me to stay away from bunny buster.

135
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,169
Scott: They busted more than but busted my bunny.

136
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:51,927
Rym: But anyway, so hunter mountain.

137
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,859
Rym: now Where was negative six when I was skiing?

138
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:56,628
Rym: tomorrow is going to be?

139
00:06:56,628 --> 00:07:00,462
Rym: 50 degrees and raining so no skiing.

140
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:03,858
Rym: so the snow report Is trying to.

141
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,550
Scott: even if they use their snow machine it would just melt.

142
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:12,130
Rym: I'm gonna read a sentence from the snow report and you see if you can tell how they've massaged this quote.

143
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:21,750
Rym: Our snow makers have put down a ton of snow this season and we are confident that this brief rain event Will not impact our conditions significantly.

144
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:24,019
Scott: That sounds like a lie.

145
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,950
Scott: I know it's 50 degrees.

146
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,973
Scott: Here's how about?

147
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:31,626
Rym: expert skier reads this our conditions are so shitty that this rain doesn't mean shit.

148
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:32,950
Rym: They can't get any worse.

149
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,119
Rym: I'm not going skiing on Saturday.

150
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,770
Scott: I mean even if they keep using the snow maker wouldn't just be mush.

151
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,850
Rym: They can't use the snow maker to be gone above a particular temperature.

152
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:48,561
Rym: But just that phrase will not impact our conditions significantly.

153
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:51,670
Rym: that it takes an expert to understand what that sentence me.

154
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,729
Scott: What if they use the same technology they use in an ice skating rink, right?

155
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,625
Scott: Except they just put it on the side of the mountain to that would be too energy intensive.

156
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:02,049
Rym: It would be literally infeasible.

157
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:08,630
Rym: But anyway the technical term for the conditions is frozen granular and that is a. they can't lie about that.

158
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:16,870
Rym: So smart people just read the thing that says this many lifts this many trails base depth And what is the technical name of the surface?

159
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,430
Rym: So yeah in actual animation news.

160
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:30,517
Scott: so every year the New York International Children's Film Festival comes to New York and Provides us with.

161
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:45,510
Scott: you know, it's Children's Film Festival in name But it has a lot of animations and also non animations films to show Among which is usually some top tier anime movies that you can't see anywhere else in English.

162
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:47,810
Scott: Also, just at least not for a while.

163
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,075
Scott: It used to be that you'd see it.

164
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,890
Scott: that would be like your only chance to see that movie in English in the u.s.

165
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:54,456
Scott: But more lately it's.

166
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:59,361
Scott: you see it at the film festival and then like three to six months later it's in US theaters.

167
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:04,770
Rym: so that a lot of Will be that it's there first or it's there early or like the directors.

168
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,301
Scott: We've seen a lot of like, you know premieres there.

169
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:15,735
Rym: Yeah, we've seen a lot of anime directors Talk about their movie at this film festival exactly including the best moment ever where that kid was like What's your favorite character?

170
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,160
Rym: And I hope it's King Cosmo.

171
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:17,723
Scott: Oh, yeah.

172
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:19,128
Scott: We saw summer wars there hosted.

173
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:19,630
Scott: It was there, right?

174
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,460
Scott: So anyway, we've been going to this thing for a long time.

175
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,327
Scott: So it's it's an early part of the year.

176
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:25,010
Scott: It's always great.

177
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:33,349
Scott: It's coming up and the two big animes they're showing is one of them is called Oko's Inn Which I guess is about a girl who runs it in or something like that.

178
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:36,523
Scott: I don't know much about it other than the name.

179
00:09:36,764 --> 00:09:38,954
Scott: Yep, the girls named Oko She's got it in.

180
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,345
Scott: and the other one is what penguin?

181
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:41,686
Scott: something?

182
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:42,510
Rym: penguin highway.

183
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:51,514
Rym: It's based so it's written by the same person who wrote eccentric family the book that was turned into the utterly Fantastic anime, right?

184
00:09:51,534 --> 00:10:00,206
Scott: So the same author wrote, Tomohiko Morimi, has written eccentric family walk on girl, the night is young Walk on girl, etc, etc.

185
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:05,330
Scott: They also wrote penguin highway and this anime is based on penguin highway.

186
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:12,630
Scott: But as far as I can tell it doesn't seem like this movie was animated either by the people who animated eccentric family.

187
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:14,854
Rym: It says, uh, Hiroyasu Ishida Okay, did they?

188
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:16,762
Scott: were they the person who animated eccentric family?

189
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:17,224
Scott: I don't think so.

190
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,730
Scott: I don't remember offhand.

191
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,737
Scott: Yeah, and I don't think it's made by.

192
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:32,050
Scott: it's definitely not made by Masaaki Yuasa who animated to Tommy Galaxy and Walk on girl, so it's like a different anime studio animating another book by the same author.

193
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:37,790
Scott: But there's also news penguin highway will be in US theaters like April ish.

194
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,470
Scott: So, I don't know if I'll see it at the film festival or just wait until April and see it in a story.

195
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,288
Rym: Yep, there's also a there's other great animation at the film festival.

196
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:54,790
Rym: tons Yeah, the New York International Children's Film Festival If you live anywhere near New York City, like it's worth a trip into the city to see a couple movies.

197
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:55,413
Scott: They also.

198
00:10:55,473 --> 00:11:03,029
Scott: they have this really cute opening like short animation with the like stop Right with these little drumming guys.

199
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,251
Scott: I

200
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,274
Rym: love those guys and

201
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:19,530
Scott: so we see this animation a lot because not only do you see it when you go to the film Festival every screening but also a lot of other screenings in the city for animation are Sponsored or brought to you by or related to the film festival even if they're during other parts of the year.

202
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:35,569
Scott: Yeah, and that little animation still plays and they mix it up a little bit every year, but it's the same song with the same little stop-motion drumming guys and It's like a thing, you know, if you're in the New York animation scene But you don't you it's like it would be completely new to you if you weren't.

203
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:44,292
Scott: Yeah, it's like this inside joke and like we're like, oh here they come There's all.

204
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:45,518
Rym: Moomin Valley is gonna be like.

205
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,331
Scott: there's a bunch of new Moomin movie that CG That's.

206
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:51,620
Scott: I heard at least one positive comment about it.

207
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:52,041
Rym: Yep.

208
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:59,873
Rym: I think that one's actually screening at the Scandinavia house And the IFC Center and the SVA theater There.

209
00:11:59,913 --> 00:12:04,245
Rym: you see it there and also eat early dinner there because Scandinavia houses really good food.

210
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,067
Scott: the Swedish meatball.

211
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:09,481
Rym: Yeah And then the fish and such Something like that.

212
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:22,830
Rym: So in some anime news Just it like you might have seen rumblings about this But I'm not gonna go into all the details because we're commentary not news, but yes Hey for background people who don't know this is dude Vic Mignogna.

213
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:29,164
Rym: Anyway full disclosure I've met him I have met with him.

214
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:35,350
Rym: I've never liked him I have never observed I have personally never run into a specific behavior.

215
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:45,594
Scott: I could have called him out other than him just being kind of break Yeah, but basically this dude is an anime voice actor most famous for being the voice of Edward Elric in the u.s Dub of Fullmetal Alchemist.

216
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:45,835
Rym: Yep.

217
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:49,707
Scott: He appeared at many many anime conventions and still does.

218
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:59,516
Scott: Yep, and Basically, you know, he was a kind of person who would pander to fans Big time right.

219
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:06,270
Rym: his panels were basically he would say something to get all the girls in the room to scream at the top Of their lungs and that was the entire panel.

220
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:06,551
Scott: Like.

221
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:11,530
Scott: he was basically like like, you know Rym disease, but a worst-case.

222
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:18,597
Scott: He is like, you know reveling in the fact that teenage girls are screaming for him Even though he's like an old man, basically.

223
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:26,603
Scott: Yeah, who you know acts like he's younger than he is and He was always sort of like, you know, at least from my perspective.

224
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:28,490
Scott: Yeah, I don't want to be near this guy.

225
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,458
Scott: I don't like this guy.

226
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:41,010
Rym: make this guy go away You know now think that interestingly because we don't go to any anime cons anymore And we don't run guys not entertaining, but we're also not in charge of any cons anymore.

227
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:48,466
Rym: There's actually a lot of video on the internet of me like doing stuff with him in panels And yeah, and then I found out he was just very clear.

228
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:51,339
Rym: I Do not endorse him at all.

229
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,050
Rym: Yeah, then I found out a video of me on a panel with him.

230
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,224
Scott: I also found out that he was very Jesus II or pretend.

231
00:13:57,264 --> 00:13:57,947
Rym: Oh, you didn't know that.

232
00:13:58,027 --> 00:13:59,877
Scott: Yeah, there's a no I didn't find that out recently.

233
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,023
Scott: I found that out a long time ago.

234
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,290
Rym: He's got like this weird Christian band.

235
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,864
Rym: He's like he's done a bunch of really homophobic stuff.

236
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:05,850
Scott: Yeah, but anyway.

237
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:11,170
Scott: So when I found that out, I was turned off to him even more than I was before.

238
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:20,070
Rym: What's weird is he is not by a long shot The only American anime voice actor who has a really like weird culty religious aspect to his career.

239
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:20,994
Scott: No, not at all.

240
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:23,626
Rym: I can name two others who are still active.

241
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:24,229
Rym: Yeah

242
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:25,555
Scott: So anyway,

243
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:34,911
Rym: basically there were always as there are with people like that You know vague suspicions and rumors and people like oh, yeah, he's a creeper and I always got a creeper vibe But

244
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:40,389
Scott: I always got a vibe, but I never witnessed him doing an actual creepy thing personally.

245
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:51,298
Rym: Yep So basically a bunch of people to whom he he has done creepy things have stepped forward to Explain and describe the creepy things he has done to them.

246
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:57,930
Scott: and those things are I believe them a thousand percent because not only Do they match my existing?

247
00:14:58,871 --> 00:15:00,881
Scott: You know impression of him being a creepy dude.

248
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:07,601
Scott: Yeah, but their description of They're like detailed descriptions of the exact turns of events.

249
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:13,917
Scott: it tracks exactly exactly match the Personality that I have observed him exhibiting.

250
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,550
Scott: Yeah, so it's like I can imagine this dude doing that exact thing and it totally fits.

251
00:15:19,272 --> 00:15:30,851
Rym: Knowing the other things I've seen that dude do more in the way I know that person behaves and even more to the point Scott and I were having conversation earlier and what came out of it was in 2019.

252
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:33,770
Rym: Nobody gets the benefit of the doubt, especially white dudes.

253
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:34,471
Scott: Yeah So it's like.

254
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:35,837
Scott: it's like there's a imagine.

255
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:40,797
Scott: if there's a dude and I saw that dude fart a lot and he smelled like farts And I'd be like, oh, yeah that farty dude.

256
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:45,196
Scott: and then someone came and told me farty dude farted on me I'd be like, I believe you.

257
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:50,767
Scott: Yep, even though I'd never saw him fart on a person I see him frequently fart and he smells like farts.

258
00:15:50,989 --> 00:16:08,255
Rym: Yep I guess the only time I would give the benefit of the doubt in that situation is if the person who told me they were Farted on was a known fascist a known farter Farter someone who did not subscribe to the Anyway who denied it.

259
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:17,364
Scott: so now be basically some good people right who have been Abused or harassed or in some way the seal was.

260
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:21,255
Rym: more and more allegations are coming out Like people are stepping forward.

261
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:24,404
Rym: I just saw a voice another voice actor step forward.

262
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:26,550
Rym: Apparently like I just saw some tweets about that.

263
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:31,406
Rym: Yeah, some people I know personally have stepped out about this.

264
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:39,330
Scott: so But basically people are like, alright, let's parade out all the bad things This guy did just like we did for all the other bad guys.

265
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:47,074
Rym: So what's notable here is that there appear to for the first time in this industry in a while be Consequences.

266
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:50,690
Rym: he has been kicked off of at least one project apparently two projects.

267
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:59,166
Rym: He's multiple cons have disinvited him as disinvited him as a guest except anime Montessori Which is like the poster child for bad cons, which doubled down on.

268
00:16:59,467 --> 00:16:59,990
Rym: we're not gonna.

269
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:06,820
Scott: Basically now you can tell which cons are good and bad based on which ones have kicked him out and which ones are still Letting them come in.

270
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:12,939
Rym: yep, so You can read all the details of this terrible.

271
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:25,278
Rym: I think it was a video of him like crying apologizing, but I did not watch Link to it and I was like, nope, you can read all this stuff and decide what you want to decide but What I don't understand.

272
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:29,978
Rym: well, I guess I do understand but the broader Problem I see here is not just that.

273
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:32,084
Rym: Oh, no, another older white dude is a creeper.

274
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:48,827
Rym: The problem is that anime cons for a long time now have drawn a like heavily girl represented younger audience and Because of the there's like this feedback cycle where the cons will invite American voice actors because they're cheaper.

275
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:58,170
Rym: They're easier to get Fans are Obsessed with the characters that these voice actors played and they transfer that obsession to the voice actors.

276
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,438
Scott: Yeah, I don't understand like.

277
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,908
Scott: I guess it's because I don't watch dubs.

278
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:01,390
Scott: Like.

279
00:18:01,491 --> 00:18:06,350
Rym: I don't think Nicolas Cage is noir spider-man because he voice acted to our spider-man.

280
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,255
Rym: Yep, I won't like like.

281
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:10,983
Rym: it is weird that that transference occurs.

282
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,230
Rym: Well, I think it's like a baby duckling.

283
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,250
Scott: I mean, it's like it's hard for me to understand period because I've never had that celebrity fan mentality.

284
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:24,551
Scott: Like I could meet someone that I'm like a true my tremendous fan of like I figured I don't know I could meet like Dr.

285
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:25,214
Scott: Rainer can is he?

286
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:25,918
Scott: I'd be like, hey, what's up?

287
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:26,339
Rym: Yeah.

288
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,384
Scott: How you doing, right?

289
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:28,630
Rym: Like sir, I respect your work.

290
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:30,120
Scott: I don't get that feeling of like.

291
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,167
Scott: I'm gonna get my game again.

292
00:18:33,371 --> 00:18:34,314
Rym: This is specific.

293
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:35,117
Rym: this is beyond that.

294
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:36,141
Rym: this is the like.

295
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:41,260
Rym: people who are fans of a character Treat an American voice actor.

296
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,117
Scott: I mean, I don't know if Rainer can is and that's why I'm saying I don't know if Rainer can is.

297
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:45,590
Scott: he is a even a good person.

298
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:53,616
Rym: I don't think that Rainer fan of games that he has made but I don't think that Rainer can is yet is the dude on The cover of the Puerto Rico box.

299
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,150
Scott: He didn't make a Puerto Rico like a safe art made porter.

300
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,583
Scott: Yes, I never say for the dude on the cover of the almond ray box or res publica.

301
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:04,658
Rym: I don't think he's the Viking in res publica like.

302
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,992
Rym: I'm not a fan of that Viking and as a result a fan of him because he Like.

303
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:11,318
Rym: this is a weird thing.

304
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:24,350
Rym: that seems to happen primarily in anime fandom Specifically and I think the reason it happened is that anime cons Encourage this behavior and as a result the con saw this feedback loop of the fans act like this.

305
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:26,290
Rym: So these people are popular.

306
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:28,781
Rym: so we need to encourage this and bring more people like this.

307
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:32,175
Rym: and the cycle continued until Half the panels and anime cons.

308
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,744
Rym: are American voice actors being treated like this, right?

309
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:36,650
Scott: It's like hey, I can bring this person to my con.

310
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:37,975
Scott: It's not that expensive.

311
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:38,717
Scott: It'll drag.

312
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,524
Scott: It'll increase attendance at my con.

313
00:19:41,187 --> 00:19:42,110
Scott: It will be profitable.

314
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,269
Scott: Why obviously you do that, yep.

315
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:59,623
Rym: And as a result anime cons across the board have excused not let's forget the harassment thing Just in general really shitty behavior by not all but many American voice actors not just Mary But I have a lot of that conventions.

316
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:11,910
Scott: in general Con guests particularly the American voice actor guests are deaf are in a great Guess at any convention of any kind especially the nerdy conventions are always in a position to where?

317
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:15,129
Scott: They can behave poorly and get away with it.

318
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:18,163
Scott: Yep They're not going to be kicked out.

319
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:19,590
Scott: They're being paid to be there.

320
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,159
Rym: Why is notable in the packs is kick some people out?

321
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:25,310
Scott: Yes, but it's like you paid someone to be there.

322
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:28,962
Scott: You're not going to then throw them out on their ass.

323
00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:31,150
Scott: You have like a contract with them, right?

324
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,250
Scott: You know, it's like it's if you're in a tough position, especially when you're a small anime con and not a pack.

325
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:41,167
Scott: But look at how like and that present that person is usually going.

326
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:45,810
Scott: if they're a guest They're usually someone who has fans that they have a great deal of power over.

327
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,102
Scott: Right because those people do have that.

328
00:20:48,303 --> 00:20:49,630
Scott: I'm a guy feeling right.

329
00:20:49,831 --> 00:21:14,790
Rym: I have a huge number of like first-hand accounts myself that I interacted with an experience to observe of a lot of anime voice actor guests at a number of conventions acting like complete pieces of shit to the Volunteer staffers trying to help them out Showing up late to panels and not in the funny like you expect Duke Nukem to show up late and hung over to the panel.

330
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,343
Rym: That's part of his shtick like that.

331
00:21:16,686 --> 00:21:29,470
Rym: That's fine but I'm talking like just doesn't fucking show up to a panel that are being paid to do until like an hour later and Nonsense like that and just demanding staffers like go out and get them sandwiches and things like really weird stuff.

332
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:38,025
Scott: Very Hollywood attitude which they're actors, but it's like, you know You're not that big an actor and even if you were you would still be an ass.

333
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,869
Scott: Yep, right It's like if I become super famous, I'm not doing that shit.

334
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:48,307
Rym: So I wouldn't be surprised if there were a number of other people Rym would tell someone to get him a sandwich.

335
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:51,134
Rym: Uh, no Who would have.

336
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:54,450
Rym: let's see I've been in situations where I've had like the green room and the pampering treatment.

337
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,069
Rym: I don't think I've ever asked anyone for anything.

338
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:58,890
Scott: Usually cuz I'm thankful for what I can get.

339
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,436
Scott: Yeah, I think part of his unique.

340
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:06,163
Rym: when kai-fu like the last time kai-fu flew me out flew me out to Oregon to give a Speech they were they bought me.

341
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:07,090
Rym: I didn't even ask.

342
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,202
Rym: They just took me to dinner and like bought me a beer and I was like, oh awesome.

343
00:22:10,302 --> 00:22:10,644
Rym: Cool.

344
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:11,186
Rym: Thanks.

345
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:12,210
Rym: This is really fun.

346
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,870
Rym: I was almost like I almost tried to pay cuz it was awkward that they were buying me dinner.

347
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,472
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

348
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,320
Rym: I've been rewatching Star Trek Voyager.

349
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,499
Rym: It's way better than I remember partly because everything better to watch.

350
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:35,976
Rym: So it's a show I watch when I'm like exercising downstairs like if I'm on the exercise bike because it's why don't you watch the time of galaxy?

351
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:37,142
Scott: so we can you know, Why?

352
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:40,099
Rym: because there's no internet downstairs in the gym.

353
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:47,491
Rym: Oh and like the internet super slow, like it won't work like LTE won't even work that well in that room You could do the the the save offline.

354
00:22:47,692 --> 00:22:49,520
Rym: Yes crunchyroll doesn't really work like that.

355
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:56,880
Rym: So I can only really watch things that I can download via Netflix and cash and Star Trek I can download.

356
00:22:57,386 --> 00:23:06,288
Rym: I've been watching Star Trek But I think the reason I have fun I like Star Trek Voyager now and I didn't like it when I was younger is that when there aren't Commercials that show is way better.

357
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,395
Scott: I mean there aren't commercials.

358
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:11,257
Scott: any shows way better Yeah, but the you can't erase his laugh tracks, but that's not a comedy.

359
00:23:11,277 --> 00:23:11,780
Scott: So not a problem.

360
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:14,119
Rym: Yeah, there aren't really laugh tracks not Star Trek.

361
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:15,907
Rym: But I was also.

362
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:19,946
Rym: I did because it was an earlier era and I was more tolerant of commercials I did watch.

363
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:24,928
Rym: like most of the next generation and You know lieutenant wharf is a character.

364
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:26,333
Scott: the clip the head.

365
00:23:26,514 --> 00:23:28,020
Rym: yeah the half-cling on guy cool, dude.

366
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,105
Scott: Uh, I thought he was a full-cling.

367
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:31,590
Scott: I'm pretty sure it was a half-cling.

368
00:23:32,252 --> 00:23:33,055
Scott: I know I don't have.

369
00:23:33,115 --> 00:23:34,560
Scott: I'm the non Star Trek nerd.

370
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,125
Rym: Yeah, well, all right.

371
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,573
Rym: was Spock a full Vulcan or half Vulcan.

372
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:40,118
Scott: I'm pretty sure he is a full one.

373
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:40,840
Rym: What about to buck?

374
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:42,463
Scott: I don't know who that is.

375
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:44,388
Rym: He's the Vulcan in Voyager.

376
00:23:44,408 --> 00:23:45,310
Scott: I don't know that.

377
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:55,620
Rym: Okay, you're anyway, you're wrong, but so this video is 15 minutes of wharf getting told to stand the fuck down and shut the fuck up.

378
00:23:55,981 --> 00:24:02,338
Rym: It's basically every time wharf is like commander will do this and someone is like nope the lay of that order.

379
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:05,988
Rym: Nope What you said is being taken under advisement.

380
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:10,480
Rym: It's just wharf getting shut down again and again and again for 15 full minutes.

381
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,623
Rym: It is glorious to watch.

382
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:12,586
Scott: I mean, that's right.

383
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:16,799
Scott: So shows have tropes right usually like that, you know, like.

384
00:24:17,762 --> 00:24:20,955
Scott: But if a show has that many episodes like next generation does how many episodes have?

385
00:24:20,975 --> 00:24:22,260
Scott: like a hundred there's a lot of.

386
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,448
Scott: It's like a fist of the North Star Number of episodes, right?

387
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:32,797
Scott: It's like now you have the power to make a montage like that Just showing every single or a compilation not a montage.

388
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:42,489
Scott: Whatever Mosaic, I just I've always enjoyed the the put them on a grid like a mosaic and the play ball Simultaneous the compilation video of all the times.

389
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,694
Rym: a thing happens in a thing.

390
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:50,908
Rym: Yep, and this is one of those Points out in the chat wharf is in fact a full Klingon Tom Hanks raised by humans.

391
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:52,755
Scott: Tom Hanks peed in a movie.

392
00:24:52,856 --> 00:24:54,000
Rym: Oh Tom Hanks peed in movies.

393
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,863
Scott: That's a classic geek.

394
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:55,586
Scott: best thing of the day.

395
00:24:55,787 --> 00:25:02,450
Rym: Tom Hanks peed in movies was the thing that made me realize that This kind of compilation could be any in a more recent movie.

396
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,978
Scott: I feel like I assume he did.

397
00:25:04,998 --> 00:25:05,500
Scott: he peed in it.

398
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,123
Rym: He had to have.

399
00:25:06,244 --> 00:25:07,552
Scott: I don't there's no way you didn't pee.

400
00:25:07,713 --> 00:25:08,035
Scott: I don't know.

401
00:25:09,782 --> 00:25:11,088
Rym: So what do you got?

402
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:11,992
Scott: I forget what did I have?

403
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:12,836
Scott: Oh, yeah.

404
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:17,320
Scott: Yeah, so New York City has a lot of fancy stores.

405
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,214
Scott: I actually work.

406
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:20,389
Scott: I The first job know.

407
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:26,853
Scott: the second job and my current job in the city Are very close to the or in the fancy clothing district.

408
00:25:27,014 --> 00:25:32,320
Rym: my previous job before I moved to my current job We actually our office moved to the fashion district, right?

409
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:32,922
Scott: So there's.

410
00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:35,936
Scott: there's actually three this sort of three different fashion districts, right?

411
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:36,760
Scott: There's Fifth Avenue.

412
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:44,024
Scott: Yeah We're like You know the Apple store and like touristy zone and that's where like ultra expensive stores are like Bergdorf Good man and shit, right.

413
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:52,759
Scott: then over and like Sixth Avenue is the fashion district Which is where you pay less taxes if you're in a fashion business.

414
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:59,460
Rym: Yep So there's a lot of wholesale places selling fabric and accessories like are we were a tech company today?

415
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,475
Scott: That's where there used to be like textile mills.

416
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:06,700
Rym: Yeah We were a tech company in a building that everyone else was a fashion company of some kind.

417
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,660
Rym: So all that meant was literally everyone in the building was way better dressed than anyone who worked in my company.

418
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:18,618
Scott: And then where I work down in Soho is basically lots of little boutique II fashion stores, right?

419
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:26,575
Scott: But anyway up in the In the more closer to the Fifth Avenue area, right is an Eve st.

420
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:31,011
Scott: Laurent, which is I guess some fancy French Fashion brand of some kind.

421
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:40,339
Scott: I've heard of it You can always heard of it so that I enough that I can kind of pronounce the big shelves that have a bunch of really Tiny individual handbags where there's just one of each one sitting.

422
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:43,780
Scott: now I've seen stores where it's a big fancy store and there's like three things.

423
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,560
Scott: No, there's like a table in the middle with like one thing on it, but it's a thousand of the same thing.

424
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,545
Scott: Yeah, and that's it.

425
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:52,320
Scott: The whole rest of the store is just like lighting and deck anyway.

426
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:59,034
Scott: So in the front of this store, they had a window display as is often right.

427
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:00,478
Scott: this window display.

428
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,681
Scott: However was Amazing.

429
00:27:03,223 --> 00:27:03,985
Rym: It's pretty great.

430
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:14,960
Scott: It was a dance dance revolution machine and the details on it are Make it clear that whoever made this DDR machine knows DDR.

431
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:33,665
Scott: The lights at the top the buttons for changing songs the bar There's a little grip on the bar the crew everything about this is somebody actually either was a DDR fan or spent the time to study real DDR machines and with that knowledge they created this Game, you can't.

432
00:27:33,706 --> 00:27:34,308
Scott: it's not a game.

433
00:27:34,368 --> 00:27:45,208
Scott: It's just it looks like a DDR machine like an art installation that's all fancy and completely has as completely perfect mirrored surfaces and then The has instead of DDR.

434
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:48,440
Scott: There's just a TV playing ads for the store, right?

435
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,364
Rym: It looks so good.

436
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:52,299
Rym: Like if I ever made a custom DDR machine, I want it to look like this.

437
00:27:52,465 --> 00:27:57,555
Scott: Yeah It's like they should make the DDR machine look like this only actually have DDR in it.

438
00:27:57,775 --> 00:28:01,800
Rym: if I ever move to a bigger place I'm getting a fucking DDR machine if I have to make it myself.

439
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:01,887
Rym: Yeah.

440
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:11,476
Scott: So this some crazy nerd like us who's a big DDR fan heard about it went to the store took a video of it Which is great because now I don't have to make a trip in the cold to see it in person.

441
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:12,340
Rym: It's not cold.

442
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,748
Rym: It's like 50 degrees out there.

443
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:14,573
Scott: It's still too cold.

444
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:15,700
Scott: Why should I make an extra trip?

445
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,089
Scott: Just look at this thing in the meta moment.

446
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:25,020
Rym: The GeekNights book club book will be 2001 2001 A Space Odyssey, so I have not yet continued reading it.

447
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,489
Scott: But last night I said to myself, huh?

448
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:30,259
Scott: I should read which means we're getting closer to me.

449
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:35,652

Rym: cuz I Just went to two three day packs.

476
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:45,533
Rym: We go to a lot of goddamn taxes, okay, so this panel will be a brand new panel.

477
00:29:46,015 --> 00:29:47,759
Rym: the real harm of games.

478
00:29:48,442 --> 00:29:49,831
Scott: Oh, yeah, I finally got the panel.

479
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,100
Scott: I wanted to do on the schedule.

480
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,940
Scott: Yeah, cuz you know we put it up doing them boring Rym panels.

481
00:29:54,428 --> 00:29:56,973
Rym: There's always a Panel with every packs of like.

482
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:57,760
Rym: what panel do we do?

483
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,685
Rym: Like which one do you want?

484
00:29:58,746 --> 00:30:00,720
Rym: and sometimes packs will surprise me?

485
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:06,420
Rym: Like I've got two panels that I think are like the highest brow like this is some serious heavy shit.

486
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:10,500
Rym: And they're like, we really want the top 40 panel because that that like that's for this con.

487
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:18,373
Scott: I'm just really curious how it's gonna go over when I go to this game positive Convention and just say games are bad for a whole hour.

488
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:20,060
Scott: Look at all the bad things games do.

489
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:23,810
Rym: The thing is these are conversations we need to have about gaming.

490
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:24,493
Scott: we sure do.

491
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:28,351
Rym: there's a reason I have not opened the like 581 loot boxes.

492
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:29,139
Rym: I've got an overwatch.

493
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,047
Scott: I thought you said he had thousand loot boxes.

494
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:33,810
Rym: No, I'm gone.

495
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,814
Rym: I'm going for a thousand.

496
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:36,601
Rym: I've got like 581.

497
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,460
Scott: I wonder if who has the most unopened loot box in the world.

498
00:30:39,983 --> 00:30:41,008
Rym: I wonder if anything is.

499
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:43,340
Rym: you could just buy loot boxes, but that would be cheating.

500
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:45,493
Scott: But Pete someone who pays for them is gonna open them.

501
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:46,639
Scott: No one's buying loot box.

502
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,029
Scott: No one's buying a thousand loot boxes and holding on to them.

503
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:53,862
Rym: Yeah, I wonder does anyone have more loot boxes than me I'm gonna?

504
00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:54,866
Rym: I'm gonna try to find out.

505
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:56,834
Scott: you should just post on the overwatch reddit.

506
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:57,557
Rym: I will like.

507
00:30:57,577 --> 00:31:00,670
Scott: I have 581 open unopened loot boxes.

508
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,614
Scott: Does anyone have more?

509
00:31:01,634 --> 00:31:04,945
Rym: Yeah without paying Honestly, the only reason I do.

510
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:08,036
Rym: it is because it really angers people who see me streaming overwatch.

511
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:10,058
Rym: Mm-hmm And that alone is worth.

512
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:13,459
Scott: How do they see if you're playing the game how many loot boxes you have?

513
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:16,773
Scott: I guess they'd only see when you like when I'm in the menu before I go in.

514
00:31:16,994 --> 00:31:22,247
Rym: Okay, and sometimes between matches I'll just go look at him Like I'll go through it.

515
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:29,933
Rym: I'll like hover over the open button like nah So, let's talk about spider-man into the spider-verse.

516
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,560
Scott: so this movie was high.

517
00:31:32,002 --> 00:31:32,986
Rym: So no spoilers.

518
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:35,838
Rym: when we're gonna will warn you before we spoil can't really spoil.

519
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,160
Rym: anyway I mean, she turns it Peter Parker.

520
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:43,225
Scott: If you don't know the story of spider-man and that spider-man fights a bad guy and beats them I don't know what to tell you.

521
00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:45,760
Rym: There are moments to spoil but we'll avoid spoilers.

522
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,039
Scott: But that's I mean, that's what happens in the movie, right?

523
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:50,586
Scott: It's good bad guy spider-man wins.

524
00:31:50,646 --> 00:31:51,127
Scott: It's good.

525
00:31:51,147 --> 00:31:54,056
Rym: If you don't know who the other villain is, right?

526
00:31:54,156 --> 00:32:01,875
Scott: Anyway, so This movie was hyped big time and usually me Scott is like no superhero move.

527
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:04,903
Scott: Yep for someone who reads superhero comics That's pretty interesting.

528
00:32:04,943 --> 00:32:07,111
Scott: Like why does Scott not want to see the Marvel?

529
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:09,600
Rym: superhero movies are largely very boring in my opinion.

530
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,217
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I mean I have an even worse opinion of.

531
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:17,120
Scott: you know I saw that first spider-man one that we saw back at RIT where he hangs upside down and kisses.

532
00:32:17,362 --> 00:32:18,228
Rym: That was all I like that movie.

533
00:32:18,248 --> 00:32:19,356
Scott: That's the first Sony one.

534
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:19,940
Scott: I like that one.

535
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:23,074
Scott: Yeah, I mean it wasn't bad, but it wasn't like wasn't great.

536
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:24,440
Rym: Yeah, I don't need to ever see it again.

537
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,063
Scott: I've seen.

538
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:26,009
Scott: I like 1989 Batman.

539
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:30,167
Scott: You know, it's in Burton Batman.

540
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:36,519
Scott: I I mean but most you know, if you're going back Like I like beat ass a thousand times more.

541
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:41,140
Rym: mask of the phantasm was probably one of my favorite superhero movies of all time and

542
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:51,418
Scott: continuously have hyped up other superhero movies like those newer Batman's like the Batman begin and then Dark Knight is like people fucking are like Lose their shit over Dark Knight, and I saw that and was like

543
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:53,827
Rym: Me, I think the Tim Burton.

544
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:57,480
Scott: I thought the one before Batman begin right was was just bad.

545
00:32:57,901 --> 00:33:00,592
Scott: Yeah, we did an episode about it way back.

546
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:02,560
Rym: It was too many movies crammed into one movie.

547
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:15,880
Scott: Anyway, so because other people's opinions have frequently clashed with mine and the feeling I get when I see the few superhero movies I've seen is nothing like the feeling I get when I read a superhero comic book that I like.

548
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:24,379
Scott: Yeah I basically just not bothered to watch any of them and I've seen actually Breathe glimpses of some of them seen here seen there like it's on a TV.

549
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,814
Scott: I'm in the room or I see it on someone else's TV on a plane or something like that.

550
00:33:30,195 --> 00:33:37,740
Scott: and everything I've seen has Only cemented my opinion that yes I don't need to watch any Avengers or any Iron Man's or any of that nonsense.

551
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:46,191
Rym: So me and Emily went to see spider-man into the spider-verse and when we came out of it What I said to Scott was it's the best goddamn superhero movie ever made.

552
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:48,056
Rym: the hype is 100% real.

553
00:33:48,317 --> 00:34:01,320
Rym: it exceeded expectations And it is the times I can think of where Either Scott or myself have gone into any form of media a game a movie anything and had our expectations exceeded.

554
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:03,089
Rym: It's happened like twice.

555
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:18,149
Scott: so I was already I was already planning to make an exception for this movie because a it was animated and to the animation from the teaser looked Phenomenal well and B because I had heard that spider-man 2099 Is in it.

556
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:23,472
Scott: if you don't know when I was a kid I went to comic book store and I bought x-men with no adjectives.

557
00:34:23,672 --> 00:34:38,739
Scott: adjectives x-men up because it's early 90s And I bought spider-man 2099. and the reason I bought spider-man 2099 is Because when I was a kid Amazing spider-man was issue like a bajillion or something and I was like I. I felt I got to start at number one.

558
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:42,992
Scott: I can't be starting at some Random crazy number and I know what's going on.

559
00:34:43,273 --> 00:34:44,277
Scott: I gotta start at number one.

560
00:34:44,337 --> 00:34:44,920
Rym: I did the opposite.

561
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,875
Rym: I just started with random x-men whatever and I also know what the fuck was going on.

562
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:50,341
Scott: and also 2099.

563
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:51,527
Scott: It's like oh, it's the future.

564
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:52,132
Scott: I love that.

565
00:34:52,232 --> 00:34:53,500
Scott: I'm a nerdy kid.

566
00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:02,831
Scott: I love the future right and that is why I didn't read William Gibson Neil Stevenson shatter-run cyberpunk anything until RIT days.

567
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:03,633
Scott: Yeah, right.

568
00:35:04,174 --> 00:35:12,078
Scott: I knew all cyberpunk shit Thanks to Peter David's spider-man 2099 that I read religiously and bought every single issue.

569
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,202
Scott: as a kid Even when the comic book store went out of business, I went to great lengths to get every single issue I could.

570
00:35:17,703 --> 00:35:19,047
Scott: I have every single issue.

571
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:23,984
Rym: and when I'm so when I told Scott I was like I like I basically the hype train is 100% real.

572
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:24,868
Rym: Holy shit.

573
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:29,287
Rym: All Scott said all Scott asked was is Spider-man 2099 in it.

574
00:35:29,347 --> 00:35:30,071
Scott: That's right.

575
00:35:30,192 --> 00:35:39,376
Scott: And my answer was yes But anyway So I eventually also was able to see it on Christmas.

576
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:39,940
Scott: like a good Jew.

577
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,820
Scott: I went to the movie theater.

578
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,009
Scott: So I went and saw as I was planning to do.

579
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:45,740
Rym: I went and saw it again in the theater on Christmas.

580
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,087
Scott: I was not in any great hurry.

581
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,052
Scott: I saw it one time.

582
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:55,145
Rym: Yep, but uh I went to a theater to see a movie twice While it was out.

583
00:35:55,427 --> 00:35:57,900
Rym: This isn't like going to the theater to see like Star Wars Episode 4 again.

584
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,216
Scott: It was the last time I did that I went to the matrix twice.

585
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:04,999
Rym: I Maybe I think that was the last time.

586
00:36:05,382 --> 00:36:10,386
Scott: Oh, I've been to the matrix twice because I saw it when it was new and then we saw it again in that I'm ex Theater at Tinseltown.

587
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:11,532
Rym: Yeah, I saw it a third time.

588
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:12,920
Scott: then that was my second.

589
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:14,400
Scott: I might have been my second in high school.

590
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:16,818
Rym: I went to it and I was like, whoa, holy shit.

591
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:18,009
Rym: And then I got all my friends.

592
00:36:18,029 --> 00:36:21,637
Rym: like guys you got to see the matrix Because I want my friends the first time.

593
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:27,571
Rym: well Cuz when I went with some of my friends then I went with the rest of my friends But I went into the matrix not actually knowing what it was about.

594
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:35,954
Rym: Mmm, so it helps anyway, so Spider-man into the spider-verse is easily the best spider-man movie ever made.

595
00:36:36,055 --> 00:36:42,551
Rym: that's easy from any Generation any country any perspective any measure of greatness?

596
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:43,534
Rym: It is the greatest.

597
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:54,027
Scott: and two, I think it is the greatest Video animated or live-action spider-man Thing of any form.

598
00:36:54,288 --> 00:36:55,152
Rym: I think that is true.

599
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:59,350
Scott: I think there may be Spider-man comics that are better.

600
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,957
Scott: maybe but it's close.

601
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:07,460
Rym: Yep I can also say that this might be it's too soon to say There is a tiny chance.

602
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:14,399
Rym: Spider-man into the spider-verse is on the very short list of movies where I will watch it anytime and never get sick of it.

603
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:15,743
Rym: I don't know.

604
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:16,586
Rym: It's too soon.

605
00:37:16,686 --> 00:37:20,661
Rym: But this is a list that has things like I mean Star Wars Episode 4.

606
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:22,749
Rym: Yeah, I mean the only in the Holy Grail.

607
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:25,340
Scott: Yeah, those are the only kinds of things I could watch repeatedly.

608
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:33,179
Scott: I don't know ultra top even if I go to things that are really good, but our second tier Yeah I have a hard time watching them repeatedly.

609
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:47,846
Rym: But when I went to see it again in the theater the second time not that long after I saw it the first time I Wasn't super hyped because I've seen it before like I was going just because a friend of ours Hadn't seen it and it was Christmas and wanted to do a thing About two minutes into the movie.

610
00:37:47,906 --> 00:37:51,079
Rym: I got real hype again, and I did not expect to feel that right.

611
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:53,373
Rym: So I also noticed a bunch of stuff.

612
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:54,380
Rym: I didn't notice the first time.

613
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,463
Scott: Oh, that's definitely gonna happen.

614
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:58,310
Rym: and I saw it 3d the first time 2d the second time.

615
00:37:58,531 --> 00:37:59,092
Scott: Oh interesting.

616
00:37:59,253 --> 00:38:00,897
Rym: So it works in 2d.

617
00:38:00,957 --> 00:38:04,309
Rym: I It is objectively better in 3d.

618
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,719
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you watch it at home, how you gonna watch in 3d?

619
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:07,442
Rym: You can't.

620
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:10,137
Rym: so you gotta at least see it in the theater once if you want to see it in 3d.

621
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:13,528
Rym: Yes, it is still in the theater, holy shit.

622
00:38:13,568 --> 00:38:17,940
Rym: right now we could go see it in 3d at the legit normal theater around the corner.

623
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,506
Rym: Yeah, how much is 40

624
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:19,546
Rym: p.m.?

625
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:21,233
Rym: 3. there's like four showings.

626
00:38:21,534 --> 00:38:22,197
Rym: There's a showing.

627
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,991
Rym: we could go see it tonight At the coffee story.

628
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,180
Scott: Are we gonna be done with the show?

629
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,496
Scott: Anyway, so the main thing that there's really two main things.

630
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,560
Scott: They're sort of tied together.

631
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,500
Scott: Anyway The first thing is that when you look at a lot of the superhero movies, right?

632
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,924
Scott: It seems like what they do.

633
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:46,520
Scott: is they take the core truth of the original comic, right?

634
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,186
Scott: Spider-man is a dude named Peter Parker.

635
00:38:48,206 --> 00:38:51,080
Scott: He's a photographer for the newspaper.

636
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:53,628
Scott: He's got a girl named Mary Jane.

637
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:55,133
Scott: Yeah, right the bad guy.

638
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:57,000
Scott: It looks like this, right?

639
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,940
Rym: These core facts.

640
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:13,416
Scott: but then they with those core facts, they tell a story and In you know both the cinema the writing and also the cinematography They tell a story in the Hollywood blockbuster way.

641
00:39:13,637 --> 00:39:18,939
Rym: Yep, right There's main villain sub villain potentially tertiary villain that will be in the sequel movie.

642
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:25,120
Scott: They and also, you know nerds, you know We always rag and rag on nerds for complaining about this.

643
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,629
Scott: Right because it is just sort of a nerdy thing to complain about.

644
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:31,823
Scott: but they get lots of details and they change them for seemingly No reason right?

645
00:39:31,904 --> 00:39:35,535
Scott: It's like why is spider-man's web shooters biological in the comic book?

646
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:36,980
Scott: They were mechanical, right?

647
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,247
Scott: It's like why did you change the costume?

648
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:40,652
Scott: Why did you change the dude?

649
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:40,873
Scott: Right?

650
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:43,080
Scott: You change all these little things, right?

651
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,480
Scott: Just you know, and nerds get upset even though those aren't really, you know of severe consequence, right?

652
00:39:49,300 --> 00:40:02,328
Scott: yet spider-man into the spider-verse comes along and Even though it is an animated movie it tells a story Cinematographically and also in terms of the writing.

653
00:40:02,709 --> 00:40:04,876
Scott: the same way a comic book tells a story.

654
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:07,304
Rym: It doesn't feel like a Hollywood movie.

655
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:10,277
Scott: it feels like I'm reading the comic book only I don't got a fucking read.

656
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:18,278
Rym: Yep and what's even crazier is that it tells a Spider-man origin story and the traditional wisdom is there are two kinds of superhero movies.

657
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:22,976
Rym: either We're gonna do the origin story that's been done a hundred times again, or we're gonna.

658
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:23,980
Scott: we're gonna skip it.

659
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,584
Scott: You already know.

660
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:26,780
Rym: Yep, or we're gonna well or we're gonna skip it.

661
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,985
Rym: You know who the fuck spider-man is.

662
00:40:28,346 --> 00:40:34,619
Rym: or the third one of we're gonna make as many sequels of the one we made with the Origin story as we can before it runs out of steam, right?

663
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:50,116
Scott: So what they do is that not only they're telling a story in a comic book way they're telling the kind of crazy story that a comic book tells the kind of story that if you tried to put it as a Screenplay for a Hollywood movie blockbuster.

664
00:40:50,136 --> 00:40:58,780
Scott: They would say no It's a story about multiple universes with crazy characters coming together in a big jumble the kind of thing that you see in comic books.

665
00:40:59,161 --> 00:41:03,876
Scott: And you never see a crazy multiverse nonsense crazy story in a movie.

666
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:07,649
Scott: They always grow in theater and You don't see that.

667
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:20,522
Rym: that's that's the kind of story that's only in comic books And it does but it does this in so many layers like it does it in a meta level it opens with this trope of Hey, y'all know the story is spider-man bit by a spider It said like.

668
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:23,160
Rym: it tells the origin story of spider-man like really quick in a comicky way.

669
00:41:23,862 --> 00:41:28,353
Rym: But then the movie itself is the origin story of another spider-man.

670
00:41:28,674 --> 00:41:33,430
Scott: like if you read even a random spider-man Comic-book right you like an old one.

671
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:37,853
Scott: It's like even you'll see you buy a spider-man I don't know like 80 or something right.

672
00:41:38,215 --> 00:41:46,398
Scott: the first page I'm willing to bet says like Oh bit by a radioactive spider Become spider-man and then it picks up wherever the last issue left off.

673
00:41:46,418 --> 00:41:47,181
Scott: yeah, right It's like.

674
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:55,004
Scott: and that's exactly the kind of storytelling mechanic that is directly transferred from the comic to this movie But not other movies.

675
00:41:55,706 --> 00:42:00,260
Scott: right it's like origin of spider-man, and we're go yep spider-man pick up where we left off.

676
00:42:00,581 --> 00:42:04,599
Rym: So in terms of visuals no movies ever looked like this before.

677
00:42:05,443 --> 00:42:09,900
Scott: Yeah, if you go online as all sorts of things the animators have been surprisingly open.

678
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,469
Scott: I don't know if someone's allowing them to be or encouraging.

679
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,260
Scott: I think Sony realized, but it is very intelligent.

680
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:15,946
Scott: They're like.

681
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:24,206
Scott: they're like check out this scene That's like on screen for like a couple seconds of one of the characters like playing the drums During a flashback.

682
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:27,520
Scott: let me tell you how hard this was to animate and here's all the crazy tricks.

683
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,893
Scott: I did appreciate my work, please and it's like oh my god.

684
00:42:30,913 --> 00:42:31,817
Scott: We appreciate your work.

685
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:32,480
Scott: Oh my god.

686
00:42:33,481 --> 00:42:37,780
Rym: So I want to read a quote for Wikipedia because this is a really one about the shader on penny Parker.

687
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,445
Scott: Yeah, that was like a low.

688
00:42:39,926 --> 00:42:48,637
Rym: it took around a year for two animators to create ten Seconds of footage that they were happy with and then they made the movie.

689
00:42:48,657 --> 00:42:49,380
Rym: based on the technique.

690
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:54,294
Rym: They developed two animators for a year and when you look at the credits for this movie.

691
00:42:54,796 --> 00:42:55,418
Scott: They long.

692
00:42:55,578 --> 00:42:56,240
Rym: Oh my god.

693
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,598
Scott: Yeah, also so many people had to poke computers and weird software just as this movie.

694
00:43:02,422 --> 00:43:05,380
Scott: It's like you thought Toy Story was like holy shit right and like now.

695
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,852
Scott: We're just sort of used to CG movies.

696
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:18,071
Scott: you take it for granted Yeah But it's like actually this may be more of an animation accomplishment or just as equal to feels like Remember when Jurassic Park came out like you'd seen movies with dinosaurs before.

697
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:22,105
Rym: when I saw Jurassic Park in the theater the entire world said Holy shit.

698
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:25,300
Rym: Yeah, these are different from this day forward, and I think that's the sort of thing.

699
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,312
Scott: It's like you look at Jurassic Park those effects.

700
00:43:28,393 --> 00:43:30,180
Scott: It's like we had seen a Star Wars already.

701
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:34,456
Scott: We had seen a Ray Harryhausen already, but they just took it to the next level right?

702
00:43:34,497 --> 00:43:37,326
Scott: so if Toy Story is The Ray Harryhausen you know.

703
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:41,840
Scott: stop-motion of CG that this is like the Jurassic Park taking it to the next level.

704
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:48,656
Scott: Yep, right every other Computer-generated animation movie is like at least one or two levels below this.

705
00:43:48,736 --> 00:43:49,900
Scott: I have at least I haven't seen one.

706
00:43:50,407 --> 00:43:51,100
Scott: That's on this level.

707
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,747
Rym: I think what someone said best what bar has been raised?

708
00:43:54,229 --> 00:44:01,108
Rym: as because then there's now there's that other spider-man movie coming out and Someone's a trailer came out and all the comments.

709
00:44:01,148 --> 00:44:03,716
Rym: I saw were along the lines of where are the colors?

710
00:44:04,037 --> 00:44:12,340
Rym: yeah like it Did two animated superhero movies that are based on comic books what Breath of the Wild did to open-world games right?

711
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,899
Rym: It was like wow here's a different way that is objectively better.

712
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:18,071
Rym: So it does this like crazy combat chromatic aberration thing.

713
00:44:18,512 --> 00:44:22,325
Rym: it looks like a comic book and in 3d It's actually even more pronounced.

714
00:44:22,706 --> 00:44:31,940
Rym: it almost looks like a shadow box of like a layered comic book the entire time and like words will appear Like the Spidey's at the very at the earliest parts of the movie in the early scenes.

715
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,780
Scott: They're actually like bringing in you know a little bit more of that free comic book panel frames And you know text boxes and stuff.

716
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,893
Rym: It's the little time I've ever seen that not like look and like act on.

717
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:47,578
Scott: yeah like word sound effects like a manga a little Bit like that comic zone game for the.

718
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:56,331
Scott: yeah This is a little bit like that at the very beginning of the movie But then they pull back on that a little bit But they don't pull back on it completely and you sort of get that.

719
00:44:56,632 --> 00:44:58,820
Scott: you know that same feel for the rest of the movie.

720
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,766
Scott: But it's not over yeah, but well.

721
00:45:00,786 --> 00:45:05,800
Rym: I think it's that it's so well integrated into the aesthetic that it doesn't feel cheap.

722
00:45:05,982 --> 00:45:07,259
Rym: It doesn't feel like a gimmick.

723
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:10,252
Rym: Yeah, a lot of movies that have tried to do this just felt like a gimmick.

724
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:13,063
Scott: part of it's also like just the speed Right.

725
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:18,668
Scott: it's like if you had a cheesy like page turning like oh my god I'd be like all slow.

726
00:45:18,748 --> 00:45:27,680
Scott: you'd be like it really grabs your attention right, but with Like like comic frame comic everything is so fast so that like if there's a cheesy thing.

727
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,488
Scott: It doesn't like distract you from the action right.

728
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:37,188
Scott: so it just you know gives you this comic book feel in the background But your eye is always on the actual action.

729
00:45:37,228 --> 00:45:41,782
Rym: that matters yep, and meanwhile like the character arcs are fantastic every character is great Right.

730
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,318
Scott: so this is the thing right is like you know I talked about like.

731
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:47,589
Scott: hey You know nerds always complain about this inconsequential stuff.

732
00:45:47,629 --> 00:45:55,110
Scott: They get wrong right, but actually this movie It's like they could have gotten nerdy stuff wrong.

733
00:45:55,191 --> 00:45:56,336
Scott: It wouldn't have really been a big deal.

734
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:59,346
Scott: It's inconsequential But the amount of nerdy stuff.

735
00:45:59,386 --> 00:46:07,570
Scott: They did that actually almost exactly matches the comics is Shocking and they didn't have to do it, but they did it right.

736
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,315
Scott: so here's the is the deal right.

737
00:46:09,355 --> 00:46:12,566
Scott: in real spider-man comic books Right there was amazing spider-man.

738
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:14,272
Scott: That's the real spider-man Peter Parker.

739
00:46:14,392 --> 00:46:25,637
Scott: right in the early 2000s They made this other series called ultimate spider-man And the I. they made this actually whole separate Marvel Universe called the ultimate universe ultimate x-men ultimate Avengers ultimate everything.

740
00:46:25,697 --> 00:46:29,450
Scott: and the idea was hey People like Scott want to start with number one.

741
00:46:30,112 --> 00:46:30,534
Scott: They don't want.

742
00:46:30,574 --> 00:46:33,625
Scott: that's why they bought spider-man 2099 Which is also another universe.

743
00:46:33,886 --> 00:46:40,329
Scott: so sort of it was the distant future of the regular universe whatever They want to start in number one.

744
00:46:40,913 --> 00:46:41,940
Scott: There is no number one.

745
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,044
Scott: We can't let go of these old comic book nerds who if we just delete all the Marvel comics That's not gonna go too.

746
00:46:47,085 --> 00:46:54,435
Scott: Well right, so let's just make new comics and Start at number one with those and a completely separate universe, so they did those.

747
00:46:54,495 --> 00:47:05,248
Scott: ultimate spider-man and Ultimate spider-man is actually not spoilers really because it happens right at the beginning of the movie is The spider-man who dies at the beginning of this movie.

748
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,940
Scott: hmm, and if you read ultimate spider-man what happens in ultimate spider-man?

749
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,784
Scott: There's a spider-man.

750
00:47:10,025 --> 00:47:12,920
Scott: he dies and miles morales is the new spider-man.

751
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,085
Scott: He is ultimate spider-man.

752
00:47:14,407 --> 00:47:30,333
Scott: this movie is in the ultimate universe pretty much exactly Right and all these other spider-men that come in from other universes are actually from other spider-man comic books and are largely faithful to Exactly what happened in those other spider-man comic books right?

753
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:33,965
Scott: It's like you can go buy the original Penny Parker comic book.

754
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:39,865
Scott: she doesn't look like that right, but at least her basic story is pretty much exactly What they said in the movie.

755
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,995
Scott: you can go buy the spider-man noir comic books.

756
00:47:42,257 --> 00:47:44,223
Scott: peter porker Spider-ham.

757
00:47:44,243 --> 00:47:45,969
Scott: those are comics that existed way back.

758
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:47,514
Scott: those are old as hell, and it's like.

759
00:47:47,555 --> 00:47:49,000
Scott: I'm surprised people didn't know about them.

760
00:47:49,261 --> 00:47:52,080
Scott: They're also just as funny as peter porker is in the movie.

761
00:47:52,521 --> 00:47:55,573
Scott: Exact same kind of joke exactly the same.

762
00:47:55,774 --> 00:47:57,200
Scott: his story is exactly the same.

763
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:06,712
Scott: I'm gonna save because I don't want to explore, but so I'm pretty sure that the the the the dumpy spider-man I'm pretty sure that's just the regular spider-man.

764
00:48:06,752 --> 00:48:17,179
Scott: y'all the real Peter Parker from Bro, Cobo Bro, Cobo spider-man, I'm pretty sure cuz I haven't read spider-man in a long time so but I remember reading.

765
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:30,157
Rym: You can figure out which spider-man is which based on the details of like every single one of those spider-man's is a spider-man from An actual spider comic book just pretty much exactly as they are in this universe.

766
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:31,020
Scott: They didn't change shit.

767
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:33,969
Rym: It's a PDNY instead of NYPD.

768
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,795
Rym: so you can figure stuff out from that right.

769
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:40,159
Scott: also the company That is the bad guy company in this movie is alchemax.

770
00:48:40,722 --> 00:48:45,220
Scott: That's the company the spider-man 2099 worked for and was super evil.

771
00:48:45,482 --> 00:48:48,080
Scott: Yeah, it's like they didn't change shit.

772
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:56,514
Scott: They just brought it straight from the comic book, and it's like hey look at you all you Hollywood people You keep changing something that people like you know some of.

773
00:48:56,594 --> 00:48:58,320
Scott: it might seem small, and it doesn't matter.

774
00:48:58,662 --> 00:49:01,820
Scott: But it's like look you didn't change it, and there wasn't a problem.

775
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,120
Scott: So why were you making those inconsequential changes however small and meaningless?

776
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,632
Scott: They may be if there was no reason to so?

777
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,180
Scott: also the story was already written.

778
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,804
Scott: It was already good.

779
00:49:11,106 --> 00:49:14,669
Rym: the music the score is Fantastic all right.

780
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:16,080
Scott: well it is fantastic.

781
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,465
Rym: It's not Star Wars fantastic But it is.

782
00:49:19,505 --> 00:49:22,493
Rym: it's not Marvel Cinematic Universe boring like.

783
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:24,218
Rym: here's the song for the part fan.

784
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:30,309
Scott: It is a. This movie is made by Sony Sony music Sony records.

785
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,336
Scott: let us promote our hit song.

786
00:49:32,396 --> 00:49:33,560
Rym: notice not notice.

787
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:42,588
Rym: I said the score not the soundtrack the soundtracks good, but I'm talking like the song they use the motif for Prowler Like that was.

788
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:48,560
Rym: that's the kind of shit that MCU movies Don't do right that song with that like the MCU movies.

789
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,140
Scott: You've already seen the video talking about how they're all boring Hans Zimmer.

790
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:53,274
Rym: I'm just talking about the score.

791
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:55,305
Rym: you want to talk to the soundtrack Score.

792
00:49:55,345 --> 00:49:58,480
Rym: the soundtrack works and also the soundtrack does work.

793
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,940
Scott: They made whoever was selecting those so you know they tracks that song a good job.

794
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:09,920
Scott: But it still sort of stands out as like I see your placement of your hit pop single in this movie.

795
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,993
Rym: Well, what about the song that they basically made for the movie the one that he's humming.

796
00:50:13,193 --> 00:50:14,057
Scott: That's also a song.

797
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:19,293
Rym: yeah Yeah, that song got stuck into everyone's head on earth not mine.

798
00:50:19,655 --> 00:50:20,397
Rym: It's stuck in mine.

799
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:21,239
Scott: I don't remember it all.

800
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:32,323
Rym: The only one I remember is I do really like the closing credits song - It's alright.

801
00:50:32,423 --> 00:50:32,865
Rym: I would both.

802
00:50:33,187 --> 00:50:37,186
Rym: the closing credits are one of the best closing credits animations I've ever seen.

803
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:38,657
Rym: I love the shit out of those.

804
00:50:38,677 --> 00:50:42,112
Rym: closing credit Is a crime that you can't watch them on YouTube because it's Sony.

805
00:50:42,133 --> 00:50:46,729
Rym: so copyright like I. Those closing credits are phenomenal.

806
00:50:46,789 --> 00:50:49,420
Rym: They they pump you up, which is not what closing credits should do.

807
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,498
Rym: I was more pumped up by the end of the credits, but I wasn't the end of the movie.

808
00:50:53,642 --> 00:50:57,722
Rym: And then we got to see the after credits thing which was There.

809
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,674
Rym: I was surprised they went there, and that was really good.

810
00:50:59,996 --> 00:51:06,185
Scott: Yeah so also right is the Bad guys in the movie?

811
00:51:06,466 --> 00:51:12,020
Rym: well one they didn't do the problem almost every superhero movie does in America of having too many villains.

812
00:51:12,304 --> 00:51:14,865
Rym: They have one villain Who's the main villain?

813
00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:17,393
Rym: and a one other villain teamed up with that.

814
00:51:17,413 --> 00:51:18,296
Rym: there are four villains.

815
00:51:18,477 --> 00:51:19,440
Rym: well two main villains?

816
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,173
Rym: But the maybe five?

817
00:51:21,355 --> 00:51:30,851
Rym: yeah But I think but the point is every sub villain was directly tied to the arc of the main Character and the story as opposed to oh and here's scarecrow.

818
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:32,235
Rym: for some fucking reason right.

819
00:51:32,475 --> 00:51:41,339
Scott: so first of all they didn't Try to bother putting tons of effort into creating lots of motivations and things around all the villains.

820
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:41,620
Scott: right.

821
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,574
Rym: well They all had good motivations because of the plot of the movie itself right the the king.

822
00:51:46,634 --> 00:51:50,527
Scott: and also they weren't afraid of using villains That the mass populace had never heard of.

823
00:51:50,628 --> 00:51:53,700
Scott: yup like kingpin spider-man most of spider-man's villains.

824
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:56,588
Scott: It's not like Batman where people know like the Joker.

825
00:51:56,768 --> 00:52:00,458
Scott: Yeah, it's like most of spider-man's villains are not anyone?

826
00:52:00,558 --> 00:52:05,283
Scott: anyone knows He's got like the lizard and it's like Mysterio.

827
00:52:05,506 --> 00:52:11,319
Scott: yeah in electro It's like the only ones anyone knows are like the people even know dr.

828
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,844
Scott: Octopus or Green Goblin.

829
00:52:12,985 --> 00:52:15,092
Scott: even those aren't like big is you know?

830
00:52:15,152 --> 00:52:15,353
Scott: it's like.

831
00:52:15,694 --> 00:52:17,642
Scott: those are like the big spider-man villains Right.

832
00:52:17,662 --> 00:52:19,110
Scott: so people don't know spider-man villains.

833
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,980
Scott: Yeah kingpin is like a general Marvel villain.

834
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,535
Scott: Who's like more of a daredevil villain, but also spider-man.

835
00:52:23,555 --> 00:52:24,299
Scott: cuz he's a New York.

836
00:52:24,601 --> 00:52:25,605
Rym: But let's talk a bit about that.

837
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:26,871
Rym: cuz that he's a good example.

838
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:29,914
Rym: cuz if we talk about all the other villains it gets into plot spoilers stuff.

839
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:35,062
Rym: but Kingpin as a character design is Phenomenal.

840
00:52:35,082 --> 00:52:36,711
Scott: he looks exactly like it does in the comic book.

841
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:41,672
Rym: He's just this giant Black brick with this little head on top white.

842
00:52:42,235 --> 00:52:42,677
Rym: no don't like.

843
00:52:42,717 --> 00:52:43,340
Rym: his suit is black.

844
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,310
Rym: He's wearing a black suit.

845
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:45,320
Rym: the suit is white.

846
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,755
Rym: I feel like there's a bunch of scenes where he's wearing a black suit in this movie.

847
00:52:47,795 --> 00:52:50,429
Scott: kingpin is like That's his thing is he has a giant white suit.

848
00:52:50,449 --> 00:52:51,133
Rym: It's not always a white.

849
00:52:51,153 --> 00:52:52,460
Rym: He's a giant white square.

850
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:57,580
Scott: He's a giant black square in the white square with juggernauts bald head on top of it.

851
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,707
Rym: I'm talking about in the movie.

852
00:52:58,807 --> 00:52:59,230
Rym: in the movie.

853
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,055
Rym: He's wearing a white suit.

854
00:53:00,155 --> 00:53:00,839
Rym: not every scene.

855
00:53:02,002 --> 00:53:04,573
Scott: I mean you can't watch the movie right now to verify their black suit.

856
00:53:04,754 --> 00:53:06,059
Rym: every image of him is in a black suit.

857
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,517
Rym: like I Said goddamn Scott you just saw this movie anyway.

858
00:53:10,959 --> 00:53:12,042
Scott: anyway They change something.

859
00:53:12,062 --> 00:53:12,443
Scott: they bad.

860
00:53:12,784 --> 00:53:16,854
Rym: they use kingpin so well like on screen.

861
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,097
Rym: He takes up the entire frame.

862
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:22,188
Scott: He's just a giant Terrifying monster which is exactly how that.

863
00:53:22,228 --> 00:53:24,939
Scott: if you read a comic book at least a good one with kingpin in it.

864
00:53:25,461 --> 00:53:29,113
Scott: That's how he's framed in the panels like there's a norm like it does.

865
00:53:29,214 --> 00:53:29,836
Scott: if you want to read.

866
00:53:29,856 --> 00:53:33,448
Scott: there's like a famous series where daredevil fights the kingpin.

867
00:53:33,488 --> 00:53:33,890
Scott: it's like.

868
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:38,389
Scott: it's like maybe the best daredevil comics there are and From like I guess the 90s ish.

869
00:53:39,053 --> 00:53:45,600
Scott: I don't remember late 80s Maybe I forget, but it's like the kingpin the way he's drawn in that it's like this huge kingpin.

870
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,966
Scott: It's like what is the superpower?

871
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:50,400
Scott: being a really big mafia boss, but also just having an enormous body.

872
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,172
Rym: He's big and strong and has a gun.

873
00:53:52,192 --> 00:53:53,240
Scott: that's pretty much it.

874
00:53:53,421 --> 00:53:53,984
Scott: It's like he.

875
00:53:54,124 --> 00:53:55,853
Scott: I don't know if he has any other superpowers nerds.

876
00:53:56,135 --> 00:53:57,039
Scott: Don't call me out on that.

877
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:00,579
Scott: Yeah, it's like daredevil who's gonna beat him and daredevils his little dude.

878
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:08,560
Rym: But also they'd like they just like the store like what kingpin is after is a very simple direct and misguided motivation.

879
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:09,385
Rym: It's not overwrought.

880
00:54:09,405 --> 00:54:10,953
Rym: the story is not about the villains.

881
00:54:11,255 --> 00:54:15,651
Rym: the story is about Miles Morales and the people in his life as he becomes spider-man.

882
00:54:15,671 --> 00:54:16,895
Scott: there are too many stories.

883
00:54:17,135 --> 00:54:18,560
Scott: not that they not that none of them work.

884
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:29,980
Scott: Right that are that focus on the villains as like the main characters Star Wars or you know the those Batman movies are the Joker's or the focus than Batman.

885
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:38,249
Scott: They're basically Joker movies right, but those movies often have people wanting to wear Darth Vader costume And now Luke Skywalker costume.

886
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:40,240
Rym: right you don't want to be kingpin in this movie.

887
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,228
Scott: No one watches this movie wanting to be any.

888
00:54:43,388 --> 00:54:47,539
Scott: maybe someone does but most people watch this movie wanting to be spider-man right.

889
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:49,265
Scott: yep Spider-man is cool.

890
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:50,570
Scott: villains are not cool.

891
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:50,891
Rym: Well.

892
00:54:50,972 --> 00:54:52,076
Scott: I should want to be good guys.

893
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:53,060
Scott: good guys should be cool.

894
00:54:53,321 --> 00:54:54,786
Scott: It's hard to make good guys cool.

895
00:54:55,046 --> 00:54:56,451
Scott: They actually made good guys cool.

896
00:54:56,471 --> 00:54:57,174
Scott: That's a good job.

897
00:54:57,194 --> 00:55:01,067
Rym: Well because they made kingpin so Chilling that moment.

898
00:55:01,088 --> 00:55:02,153
Rym: That's how he is where.

899
00:55:02,194 --> 00:55:03,260
Scott: that's exactly how he is.

900
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,632
Scott: Yeah, and change, but that moment where spider-man says why is good?

901
00:55:06,733 --> 00:55:16,920
Rym: when spider-man is explaining that your plan It won't do what you think it didn't make mess with a good formula And how he reacts and what he does to spider-man like like that moment was just a an amazing chilling moment.

902
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:20,713
Rym: There's so many moments like this in this movie, so all you know another thing right.

903
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:21,616
Scott: so the villains right.

904
00:55:21,636 --> 00:55:22,760
Scott: you got the doctor octopus.

905
00:55:22,881 --> 00:55:24,934
Scott: Also from the comments past this point assume.

906
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:25,880
Rym: We're gonna spoil some stuff.

907
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:31,640
Scott: So I think but there's a henchman right in this movie who they do not name the henchman in the movie.

908
00:55:31,903 --> 00:55:35,125
Scott: So a nerd will be like ah Right, but you look at that guy.

909
00:55:35,346 --> 00:55:36,009
Scott: It's tombstone.

910
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:36,270
Scott: Yep.

911
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:40,920
Scott: It says a guy is it's it's a. it's like a throwaway Marvel villain character named tombstone.

912
00:55:41,261 --> 00:55:49,020
Scott: He's just like a basically a strong dude who's all white and has white hair and looks like a tombstone And he's in the movie.

913
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:50,966
Scott: He's just like a gennaro henchman.

914
00:55:50,986 --> 00:55:55,080
Scott: that like keeps recurring like you see him over and over as a henchman doesn't do it.

915
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:55,361
Rym: He's just.

916
00:55:55,482 --> 00:55:58,400
Scott: if you're not a nerd you won't know that that's a particular guy.

917
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,869
Scott: But they put him in there and didn't.

918
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:01,733
Scott: that's like yeah, that's.

919
00:56:01,974 --> 00:56:06,669
Scott: he's basically just like a for hire Extra henchman plus plus in comics.

920
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:07,794
Rym: That's how you do it.

921
00:56:08,175 --> 00:56:09,280
Scott: That's how to make these movies.

922
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,565
Scott: They didn't mess with it.

923
00:56:10,605 --> 00:56:11,207
Scott: They're like.

924
00:56:11,307 --> 00:56:12,732
Scott: Oh, what's good at a Marvel Comics.

925
00:56:12,753 --> 00:56:14,679
Scott: Let's take exactly that and not fuck it up.

926
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:15,464
Rym: They made him.

927
00:56:15,484 --> 00:56:16,411
Rym: so what's his motivation?

928
00:56:16,431 --> 00:56:17,760
Rym: kingpin fucking paid him?

929
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,829
Scott: He's on a salary how many times right are we?

930
00:56:20,849 --> 00:56:24,580
Scott: and not just superheroes, but like anything where it's like man.

931
00:56:25,461 --> 00:56:30,500
Scott: You know Hollywood always does this and that and people are like oh, but you know they have to do that.

932
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:31,505
Scott: You know it won't work.

933
00:56:31,545 --> 00:56:32,228
Scott: You know there's like these.

934
00:56:32,308 --> 00:56:33,152
Scott: you know sort of like.

935
00:56:33,434 --> 00:56:34,720
Scott: I don't know what to call it.

936
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,860
Scott: There's like a term for it right sort of like accepted truths right that you know where it's like people.

937
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,583
Scott: You know they do.

938
00:56:41,703 --> 00:56:44,113
Scott: oh, we can't have a we can't have a female lead.

939
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:45,138
Scott: We'll sell less tickets.

940
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:46,183
Scott: right It's like.

941
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:46,545
Scott: well.

942
00:56:46,585 --> 00:56:47,592
Scott: Have you have you tried.

943
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,920
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

944
00:56:48,982 --> 00:56:49,418
Scott: Oh, we got it.

945
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,105
Scott: We can't just turn the comic book.

946
00:56:51,145 --> 00:56:54,837
Scott: Americans won't read subtitles right Americans won't read so it gets a good one.

947
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:58,910
Scott: right where it's like People just believe that and they just accept it and they won't risk.

948
00:56:59,652 --> 00:57:01,739
Scott: not you know going against this sort of.

949
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,648
Scott: you know You know this sort of like.

950
00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:06,540
Scott: you know assumed belief.

951
00:57:06,981 --> 00:57:07,443
Scott: But it's like.

952
00:57:07,463 --> 00:57:08,987
Scott: have you ever tried?

953
00:57:09,148 --> 00:57:13,100
Scott: is where it's like do it the other way to prove me to me that it won't work.

954
00:57:13,322 --> 00:57:20,960
Scott: Right it's like look You just made a superhero movie without changing shit from the comics and doing it exactly what the comic does and the world agrees.

955
00:57:21,061 --> 00:57:24,720
Scott: It's the greatest superhero movie ever made and it was better than all those other times you tried.

956
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:26,506
Scott: So I guess you were wrong.

957
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:27,308
Scott: stupid Hollywood.

958
00:57:27,328 --> 00:57:28,893
Scott: Yeah, you just proved you were wrong.

959
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:32,704
Scott: good job, so I was right all along I guess.

960
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:35,480
Rym: spoilers past this point cuz I was not much to spoil.

961
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:39,360
Rym: Yeah, of course it's a spider-man movie.

962
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,506
Rym: I want to talk about a few things.

963
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:41,672
Rym: so we'll spoil this up.

964
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,320
Rym: if you haven't seen the movie just stop listening.

965
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,531
Scott: It's a happy ending kids movie.

966
00:57:44,652 --> 00:57:47,333
Rym: all we're gonna do is And then end the show.

967
00:57:47,353 --> 00:57:48,259
Rym: cuz we've been going for an hour.

968
00:57:48,741 --> 00:57:54,118
Rym: I think we spend enough time telling you to go see this goddamn movie like go see everyone's already seen it.

969
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:57,044
Scott: if you haven't seen It is listening to someone talk about the thing They've already seen.

970
00:57:57,064 --> 00:57:57,466
Scott: they already like.

971
00:57:57,487 --> 00:58:00,886
Rym: if you haven't seen it the hype train is real And it's still in theaters.

972
00:58:00,926 --> 00:58:03,337
Rym: You could just go see it at a normal theater like tonight.

973
00:58:03,598 --> 00:58:17,760
Rym: hmm So spoiler wise I think the moment that my favorite moment in the movie is the Doc Ock reveal because Like it really set you up as like oh that scientist cuz you see her in the thing before like the school thing.

974
00:58:18,282 --> 00:58:20,390
Rym: Oh, she's probably like just working for this company.

975
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:21,374
Rym: He doesn't know what she's doing.

976
00:58:21,394 --> 00:58:28,936
Rym: and when she's like oh spider-man I'm a fan, and he's like oh hey, and they're talking the slow reveal of who she is.

977
00:58:28,956 --> 00:58:33,289
Scott: that was a plus I guess I already knew But I saw that they were doing.

978
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:33,610
Scott: I was like.

979
00:58:33,631 --> 00:58:36,103
Scott: so when I first saw right I was like.

980
00:58:36,123 --> 00:58:37,670
Scott: I was like oh, it's dr.

981
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:52,721
Rym: Octopus, but then I was like oh They're not telling anyone So clever also and may and Doc Ock were definitely in a relationship at some point Convinced.

982
00:58:52,902 --> 00:58:56,559
Scott: so the Aunt May right is like when they were like oh, that's the best and may I've ever seen.

983
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,160
Scott: well That's what I'm saying is like when they were gonna go see Aunt May.

984
00:58:59,301 --> 00:59:01,535
Scott: I was like what Aunt May are they going to see?

985
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:02,280
Scott: yeah, right?

986
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,841
Scott: I was like it's yeah I was like.

987
00:59:03,861 --> 00:59:05,186
Scott: I was like it's the old cuz.

988
00:59:05,226 --> 00:59:09,020
Scott: I hadn't read enough ultimate comics to know what the ultimate and may was like.

989
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:10,907
Rym: She's a badass right.

990
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:17,289
Scott: and I was like it's not gonna be old decrepit and may Like oh some villains are here again.

991
00:59:17,309 --> 00:59:21,280
Rym: It's not gonna be dead and Doc Ock shows up, and she's just like live.

992
00:59:22,224 --> 00:59:24,074
Rym: That was the funniest moment in the whole movie.

993
00:59:24,114 --> 00:59:29,470
Rym: Yeah Uh Prowler like Prowler's arc was good.

994
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:30,637
Rym: I saw that come in the whole movie.

995
00:59:30,677 --> 00:59:31,763
Scott: like I mean Cuz.

996
00:59:31,803 --> 00:59:32,847
Scott: I mean if that's the thing is like.

997
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:35,879
Scott: you know the story of spider-man, and it's like it's spider-man's uncle.

998
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:37,647
Scott: well Yep, I was like.

999
00:59:38,129 --> 00:59:39,153
Scott: Oh, that's your uncle vote.

1000
00:59:39,294 --> 00:59:39,876
Scott: He is also.

1001
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:44,331
Rym: He is bad and Beauty this movie even if you don't know that there's.

1002
00:59:44,371 --> 00:59:46,720
Scott: there's so many like it's spider-man's uncle Ben.

1003
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,300
Scott: I wonder what will happen to spider-man's uncle Ben in a different universe.

1004
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:51,645
Rym: Let's say you don't know any of that.

1005
00:59:51,665 --> 00:59:53,011
Rym: you don't know who Prowler is or anything.

1006
00:59:53,332 --> 00:59:57,108
Rym: it sets it up the cop dad Doesn't trust the uncle.

1007
00:59:57,349 --> 00:59:58,214
Rym: yeah for a reason.

1008
00:59:58,275 --> 00:59:58,878
Rym: so he just doesn't.

1009
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,384
Scott: Spider-man's uncle is not.

1010
01:00:00,524 --> 01:00:08,979
Scott: if you find out tomorrow like if your nephew if anyone has a nephew or a niece and they come to You and they say that they are spider-man or a woman get some kind of protection plan.

1011
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:18,739
Rym: But then You know obviously like he's probably got some criminal thing going on like you get that sense.

1012
01:00:18,779 --> 01:00:24,347
Rym: the movie Just like if you don't anything else spider-man, but then he gets that phone call is like oh I gotta go take care of something.

1013
01:00:24,589 --> 01:00:25,898
Rym: and then he's not in the movie anymore.

1014
01:00:25,918 --> 01:00:31,980
Rym: and Like it's it is very easy to connect the dots even if you have never heard of spider-man.

1015
01:00:32,363 --> 01:00:34,080
Rym: What's gonna happen in that art?

1016
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,343
Rym: I appreciate that.

1017
01:00:35,363 --> 01:00:41,120
Rym: and again his light mode like his motif his his song is real good.

1018
01:00:41,884 --> 01:00:52,886
Scott: So the only thing missing from this movie for me Which makes sense because it's Miles Morales is the spider-man the main spider-man right is The the the only spider-man you know.

1019
01:00:52,906 --> 01:00:58,308
Scott: the I guess core aspect is Daily bugle J. Jonah Jameson.

1020
01:00:58,528 --> 01:00:59,692
Scott: yeah, man's got a you know.

1021
01:00:59,853 --> 01:01:01,860
Scott: get some pictures of spider-man Parker, right?

1022
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,938
Scott: You know all that stuff was not in the movie because it wasn't journalist Peter Parker.

1023
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:07,359
Scott: spider-man.

1024
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,363
Rym: Yeah, it's a man.

1025
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:10,931
Rym: so because it's the Miles Morales spider-man movie.

1026
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:22,795
Scott: all the other spider-man are part of his origin story right so But the thing is as someone who was reading spider-man comics J. Well, it's like I wasn't missing it during the movie.

1027
01:01:23,136 --> 01:01:31,283
Scott: right it's like during the movie I didn't feel like there was a missing gap because obviously this kid is not a Journalist right.

1028
01:01:31,363 --> 01:01:34,373
Scott: so it you know he didn't have you didn't need to make money or anything.

1029
01:01:34,453 --> 01:01:36,520
Scott: so it didn't feel like something was missing.

1030
01:01:37,082 --> 01:01:42,620
Scott: But then after the movie was over my brain was like oh that spider-man was missing something.

1031
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,690
Scott: It's like oh, and I'm like ah, but I'm like.

1032
01:01:46,192 --> 01:01:48,200
Scott: I wish it was in there, but there's nowhere to put it in there.

1033
01:01:48,985 --> 01:01:49,227
Scott: it's like.

1034
01:01:49,267 --> 01:01:57,164
Scott: it's like it's like you finish the puzzle and The puzzle is complete and has no missing pieces, but there is a piece on the side of the puzzle Yeah, and it's like.

1035
01:01:57,184 --> 01:01:58,731
Scott: is that from like another puzzle.

1036
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,198
Scott: They just got in this box.

1037
01:02:00,479 --> 01:02:02,495
Scott: well Cuz and it's like you kind of want to use it.

1038
01:02:02,515 --> 01:02:06,474
Rym: well cuz the movies But there's no it the puzzles done cuz the movies dense and complete.

1039
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:11,198
Rym: every arc every Characters arc like completes as much as it needed for something.

1040
01:02:11,238 --> 01:02:11,460
Scott: That's all.

1041
01:02:12,222 --> 01:02:12,505
Scott: What's it?

1042
01:02:12,546 --> 01:02:13,092
Scott: two hours?

1043
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:13,477
Rym: Yeah?

1044
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:27,480
Scott: They managed to fit a lot like there's a usually like you know sometimes movies I'll have like an early scene where it's like in a school, and then the school's forgotten and you're away from it, right Yeah, they managed to get that school part going.

1045
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:32,335
Scott: It's like yeah, eventually they get away from the school And it doesn't matter anymore right cuz he's still a kid in school.

1046
01:02:32,355 --> 01:02:46,492
Scott: a lot of high school scenes but the high school scenes were is or they lasted deep enough into the movie and Were substantial enough that it doesn't feel like the way Naruto feels where it's a funny Ninja school for four episodes never funny ninja school again.

1076
01:04:14,927 --> 01:04:30,950
Rym: Yeah well I guess what I The thing I like the most about the movie like is the way it framed itself in that it starts with the hey You know the spider-man origin story and then the trope where when the other spider-man appears you get his origin story And then when the three appear it's like here's the three origin stories.

1077
01:04:31,511 --> 01:04:45,259
Rym: and then like the the turning point of the movie like the P The moment before we get into the finale is the climax is the moment where the comic book for Miles Morales Falls onto the screen and it's just like here's the spider-man origin story.

1078
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:52,280
