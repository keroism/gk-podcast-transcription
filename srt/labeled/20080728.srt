1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,587
Rym: It's Monday July 28th.

2
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:12,430
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,919
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:19,600
Rym: tonight We talk a bit about whether or not you were morally justified in stealing people's Wi-Fi.

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:35,876
Scott: If you listen to last Thursday's show you know that us cooking dinner lately has been a rarity.

7
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,600
Scott: and since dinners in the oven right Now but it's only gonna be in there for like 10 minutes.

8
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:43,640
Scott: Let's record the news real quick so we can go down and eat it at the right time.

9
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:45,226
Rym: One thing about the whole dinner thing.

10
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:47,294
Rym: It's not so much that we don't cook dinner.

11
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:48,580
Rym: It's that Scott doesn't cook dinner.

12
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:50,769
Scott: Hey, I cook sometimes.

13
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,899
Rym: Yeah, you haven't cooked in a while not in a while.

14
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,168
Scott: No Cooking again in September.

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,188
Rym: most of these suggestions are They're not really that useful.

16
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,618
Scott: They're not things that we have not known about before.

17
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:07,640
Rym: yes It's more a matter of even those things take too much time Yeah, or they don't produce food that tastes good enough to be worth the time.

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:16,538
Rym: I mean sure I can cook a real quick meal of rice and something in like 10 minutes But I for all that I'd rather go hungry or just eat out.

19
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:19,228
Rym: yeah All right.

20
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:20,271
Scott: so check this out right.

21
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,118
Scott: there's been this big news today's.

22
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,620
Scott: oh my god There's a new search engine and compete with Google.

23
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:27,554
Rym: I think I have to redact that a little bit.

24
00:01:27,675 --> 00:01:28,680
Scott: It doesn't eat with Google.

25
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,670
Rym: There's a search engine gasps.

26
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,716
Scott: There's been search engines since 1990.

27
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:35,358
Scott: God knows what.

28
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:40,379
Rym: of course It's funny how you think back through the early days of search engines, and it was like they all sucked.

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,566
Rym: well No, no, but the internet.

30
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:43,660
Rym: You know was barely usable without search engines.

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,780
Rym: They're all these kind of hacks But like one by one kind of like in Europe only at a much more accelerated pace one by one.

32
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:57,198
Rym: Every single search engine that was worth a damn would like Ascend to the top and then within three or four months be completely forgotten by the next one.

33
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:00,011
Scott: yep But anyway everyone's talking about.

34
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:05,410
Scott: the only reason this one's getting attention Alright is because it's written by ex Google people.

35
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,045
Scott: so they're like oh if these people left Google and made a new search engine Maybe it'll be better than Google.

36
00:02:11,346 --> 00:02:14,274
Rym: wait left Google, or were fired by Google now.

37
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:14,956
Scott: They left Google.

38
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:16,240
Scott: I'm sure I'm pretty sure.

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,666
Scott: Uh-huh they were now.

40
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:21,740
Scott: I know that they were at Google at one point and no longer are with Google anyway.

41
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:25,640
Scott: So the search engine they made is called cool.

42
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:30,468
Scott: It's spelled c-u-i-l because they think they're so cool But they're not someone's shot.

43
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:40,265
Rym: actually noted something very important about cool But they made the critical mistake of branding a new product in that they named it something that you do not Automatically know how to pronounce.

44
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:47,409
Rym: yeah, Google is a stupid name, but you look at it, and you know exactly how to say yeah It's a typical marketing mistake, but that's not what kills them.

45
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:50,980
Scott: what kills them is this number one search results not so good.

46
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:51,582
Scott: All right.

47
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:59,160
Scott: number two the search results are look pretty interesting because they give you like them in columns with pictures And it's it's neat, but it's not helpful.

48
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,329
Scott: It's it's hard to skim that page to get the information quickly.

49
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:08,207
Scott: and the killer of cool the worst part about it the reason it Will not succeed it's slow.

50
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:14,188
Scott: the number one thing already sped up since this morning The only no Google is instant.

51
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,955
Scott: I push the button and BAM there it is.

52
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:18,240
Scott: if it's not that fast It's not worth point out.

53
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,155
Rym: I've been searching on this for the last few minutes, and it's been instant.

54
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:23,509
Scott: every time I clicked I wasn't instant this morning.

55
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:24,958
Rym: Yes, cuz everyone in the world was hitting it.

56
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:28,200
Scott: Yeah, well they need to be able to handle ahead everyone in the world hitting it.

57
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,631
Scott: You can't compete so that presents a problem.

58
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:35,107
Rym: I don't because if that is actually the case It'll be impossible for anyone to ever be Google.

59
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:35,769
Scott: I think it is.

60
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:36,731
Scott: I think it is.

61
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:43,411
Scott: until the world changes to where there's a new Paradigm besides the web search engine Google's gonna be the king.

62
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:44,355
Rym: here's the scary thing.

63
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,484
Rym: you know I was talking about all these different search Engines back in the day.

64
00:03:46,524 --> 00:03:46,987
Rym: think of this.

65
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:54,396
Rym: I remember I used Yahoo for like Four or five months, and then I switched to Alta Vista because it was better.

66
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,420
Rym: for like six months.

67
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,560
Rym: Yeah, and then I went back to Google or not to Google.

68
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,200
Rym: I went back to Yahoo for another month or two And then I switched to Google and I've been using them for almost a decade.

69
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:10,020
Scott: Yeah, I mean I was that I remember I was using Yahoo But I didn't like it because it was just a directory and Alta Vista got all these pages.

70
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,442
Scott: And then I was like going a web crawler and you know like goes and Alta Vista And I was.

71
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:18,913
Scott: whenever I wanted to search for something I would like for a time I would go to every search engine seeing what came up.

72
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:22,325
Scott: You know the major ones at least Until eventually I would go to.

73
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:38,998
Scott: I went to Yahoo and Yahoo was working better than the others and at the bottom it said Powered by Google where it used to say powered by hotspot and hotspot was an okay search engine because it let you get real specific Like show me only SWF files and stuff like that, but Yahoo switched to being powered by Google.

74
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:41,606
Scott: so one day I was like huh What is this Google that powers them?

75
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:46,042
Scott: and I clicked on it and it brought me to Google and I said I can just use The Google.

76
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:47,931
Scott: why am I using the Yahoo to use the Google?

77
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:49,979
Scott: and it was the same search results that Yahoo was getting.

78
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:53,573
Scott: I was Like hey fuck Yahoo, and then Google ever since.

79
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:54,798
Scott: so the end?

80
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,300
Rym: yeah.

81
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,606
Rym: It's kind of interesting though one thing.

82
00:04:56,626 --> 00:05:02,473
Rym: I mean it see while it's not as good as Google it's nowhere near as good or as useful as Google.

83
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:03,899
Rym: Google is like just the.

84
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,769
Rym: It's so transcendent for searching to the point that you use it without even thinking about it.

85
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:20,980
Rym: Yeah, but Most of the people who were complaining on slashdot and Fark and all these places We're doing these super generic one-word searches and their complaint was this and this alone.

86
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:25,720
Rym: It didn't give me the exact same list of things that Google gave me for the super generic search.

87
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:26,870
Scott: That's like the.

88
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,894
Scott: it's like the old argument Oh Linux the interface is bad is not the exact same as the wind.

89
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:32,722
Rym: or like the anime fanboy Argument.

90
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:36,320
Rym: when you're watching if you have the subtitles and the dub on they look at the subtitles.

91
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:40,878
Rym: They see that it's different from the dub and then decry the translation is being wrong.

92
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:45,340
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but I point out I search for something kind of specific.

93
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,720
Rym: I searched for RIT anime the old anime club that we used to run.

94
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:53,561
Rym: I used to run and Scott used to Infiltrate.

95
00:05:53,822 --> 00:06:05,922
Rym: that's fine infiltrating as far as the shadow King shadow something Anyway, so I searched for it and actually all the things on the front page It shows.

96
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:10,458
Rym: the first link is the arti anime clubs home page with a picture of the arti anime club.

97
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:10,920
Rym: It's perfect.

98
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,390
Rym: The next one is the list all the arti anime club.

99
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,740
Rym: Third one is another page on the arti anime club.

100
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,875
Rym: It's got all these like.

101
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:20,080
Scott: really It's not gonna be stupidly off the thing.

102
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:28,139
Scott: The real test would be to search for like complicated things like I'm looking for You know, especially like the kind of things I search for when I'm at work.

103
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:38,160
Scott: I need a class a PHP class that helps me export, you know Excel sheets from you know, you're missing the point.

104
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,760
Rym: What I'm saying is that Google is good at that.

105
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,760
Rym: Google is good at searching for the specific unit of information you want irrespective of where you get that information.

106
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,900
Rym: You just want the piece of information.

107
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:51,880
Rym: But at least with a few searches and the anime club one's a good example.

108
00:06:52,381 --> 00:07:01,148
Rym: It gives you kind of at a glance an overview of a topic of a semi-specific not ultra specific and not ultra Wikipedia for that most of the time.

109
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:02,895
Rym: but Wikipedia doesn't give it to you at a glance.

110
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:08,713
Rym: and honestly Wikipedia's quality in terms of editorial content has been dropping lately.

111
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,980
Rym: people grammars getting worse and worse.

112
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:15,983
Rym: I actually kind of gave up on editing for a while because I just couldn't deal with all the crap I had to fix.

113
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:25,940
Scott: the thing is I mostly I don't you usually use people write these big Wikipedia articles And I really think those big articles are only for the people doing like a research project and for the people.

114
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:32,200
Rym: When I go to Wikipedia, you want the simple English Wikipedia, which just tells you basically what something is as simply as possible.

115
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:38,977
Scott: Yeah, that's what I pretty much use it for But usually it also is I want like to find one specific fact about something that might not be just.

116
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:39,680
Scott: what is it?

117
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,800
Rym: You know, I usually that that's when you google for it and you'll find the Wikipedia page with that one nugget exactly.

118
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:55,200
Rym: But what this does is it gives you a nice overview and I'm looking and it links to GeekNights Because you know we used to be there links to anime cons and torque on and it's actually it worked really well.

119
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,134
Rym: The only problem the only problem is that the next two GeekNights.

120
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:00,580
Rym: It shows a picture of some Nokia phone.

121
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:03,596
Scott: Yeah, I'm not gonna be using the search engine.

122
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,260
Scott: That's all I can say.

123
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,980
Rym: I just I foresee that this search engine could survive because it could provide a service that is not a service Google provides.

124
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:13,504
Scott: I don't see it.

125
00:08:14,046 --> 00:08:14,347
Rym: I don't know.

126
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,314
Scott: There's a search for RIT anime on Google.

127
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,619
Scott: You'll find the same thing.

128
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:20,840
Scott: There's no reason to use this one instead of Google.

129
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:21,904
Scott: It's just more work.

130
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:26,423
Rym: actually know if you search for RIT anime on Google you find Links to all.

131
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:30,742
Rym: these is actually a completely different set of links for the most part and one of that Let's see.

132
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:32,390
Scott: The top link is the artsy anime club.

133
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,020
Scott: Yes, but what else do you need?

134
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,363
Rym: What if you're not?

135
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:38,539
Rym: what if you're just looking for an over you want to see like how what are kind of the websites about?

136
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,000
Rym: this thing Opposed to a specific piece of information.

137
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,949
Scott: I don't see why I would need to do that there either.

138
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:48,808
Scott: is not a time during my searching where I feel like There is a kind of search.

139
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:50,780
Scott: I need to make that I am NOT capable of making.

140
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:55,020
Rym: Well, I think the thing is you don't search for that kind of generic information.

141
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,828
Scott: There's no information that I currently cannot search for.

142
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:02,480
Scott: So what what need does this, you know, what problem does this solve?

143
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,489
Scott: Well, it's solving a non-existent problem.

144
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:10,739
Rym: Well, I think if it does solve anything at all I think it's providing an alternate kind of searching that I think some people are gonna like.

145
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:12,548
Rym: I think Do that.

146
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:16,165
Scott: Well, no one's gonna use this after you know It stops being paid.

147
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:22,816
Rym: because one other thing I can say and what if you hadn't kept interrupting what I would have finished is That Google gives you a lot of shit.

148
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:27,580
Rym: search results I mean Google's good like the top one will always be what you're looking for for like something specific.

149
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:39,540
Rym: But half the other links on Google will be the same thing on dig The same thing on all these other listsites on all these other aggregators and I didn't find any of that in cool.

150
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,248
Rym: Of course, I'm sure cool will eventually.

151
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:41,831
Rym: I don't know.

152
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,600
Scott: That's what I found that I searched for me on cool.

153
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:49,038
Scott: It was like me on you know list all You are on the internet.

154
00:09:49,842 --> 00:09:54,096
Rym: Maybe I'm in a lot of places But that's sort of like for like a club or something.

155
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:56,265
Rym: There's a Podcast going Google.

156
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:57,028
Rym: you find nothing.

157
00:09:57,068 --> 00:10:00,180
Rym: but all these other websites that just have the same syndicated content.

158
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:03,259
Rym: It doesn't happen as much on cool yet.

159
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:10,140
Rym: So in some other news I kind of wanted to talk about all the business going on with software patents.

160
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:12,390
Rym: But I kind of want to wait until that.

161
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,800
Rym: we have more of a solid story there.

162
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,916
Scott: Yeah, I mean we talked about software patents enough times, you know saying they're bullshit is enough.

163
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:21,160
Scott: It's like a huge development.

164
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:30,430
Rym: Well, the development is basically that the USPTO has been very rapidly moving its stance toward just outright Devalidating all of them.

165
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,740
Scott: Yeah, it's a good chance But let's save the news until they do invalidate all of them.

166
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,571
Scott: Then we'll make a huge news out of it.

167
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:37,940
Scott: Like we could do a whole episode going.

168
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:52,997
Rym: But equally important here is that the FCC has been really there's been a lot of debate as to what to do about Comcast and you know and other ISPs and the fact that they've been kind of surreptitiously throttling peer-to-peer content.

169
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:55,483
Rym: Mm-hmm and They voted the.

170
00:10:55,543 --> 00:11:00,520
Rym: you know, the five commissioners of the FCC have voted to punish Comcast.

171
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:04,190
Scott: I'm torn two ways on this quote.

172
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,500
Rym: the initial report on the vote said nothing about which way.

173
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:09,128
Rym: Oh wait, that quote doesn't have anything into it.

174
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:09,690
Rym: Never mind.

175
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,472
Scott: Great quote.

176
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:11,255
Scott: Great quote.

177
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:12,980
Rym: I realize the quote is just partisan BS.

178
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:13,724
Rym: I don't care about ya.

179
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:14,850
Scott: Do you want to tell me the two ways?

180
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:15,373
Scott: I'm torn.

181
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:18,288
Rym: Well me Why would I tell you the two ways you're torn?

182
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:19,936
Scott: All right, so the two ways I'm torn.

183
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:23,154
Scott: on the one hand Comcast is assholes getting punished.

184
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,160
Scott: Awesome, right?

185
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:31,924
Scott: I mean, come on as the obvious feeling to have right at this is Comcast was assholes filtering bit torrent Violating that neutrality.

186
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:33,769
Scott: the FCC is coming down on them.

187
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:36,517
Scott: That's protecting that neutrality weren't filtering.

188
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:43,308
Rym: It's not like they were saying I know I know but it's not like they were saying hey, we're gonna block these ports If you want to use our service, you can't use these ports or anything like that.

189
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:46,780
Rym: They were basically engaging in malicious behavior.

190
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:48,060
Scott: Yeah, we know what they were doing.

191
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:53,440
Scott: The thing is I'm torn the other way because I read this guy had a really great write-up.

192
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,706
Scott: I'll see if I can find the link.

193
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:59,893
Scott: some guy on the internet says it wasn't some guy I think was an actual like editorial in a newspaper.

194
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,280
Rym: Oh, so some guy.

195
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:06,420
Scott: Anyway, what he was talking about though was he was also supporting the net neutrality.

196
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:15,959
Scott: But what he said was this is sort of like the straw that's going to be broken and perhaps open a floodgate And another metaphor I can throw in there as well.

197
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:23,785
Scott: And that here we have for the first time Non-engineers Regulating the internet in some way.

198
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:29,679
Scott: every decision about how the internet works or how it's going to be run has always been done by engineers.

199
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:37,910
Scott: Another you know somewhere in the world, you know It's engineers that have come together and made the decisions about how networks will be run.

200
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:46,439
Scott: and here we have the first touch of government Bureaucracy of and you know politicians and those sorts of people get in their hands and now it's the FCC.

201
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:49,100
Rym: So it's a little bit engineering.

202
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,582
Scott: I disagree

203
00:12:49,602 --> 00:13:04,234
Rym: because there's been a ton of legislation regulation about the internet and technology over the years by governments and not engineers and I would argue that a lot of the people who like what who have been making decisions about the internet are Technically engineers in the same sense that my job description.

204
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:05,600
Rym: It has the word engineering in it.

205
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:11,091
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, you know There's some principle to the thing that you know once.

206
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:15,408
Scott: if the FCC can do this that means they can do other things We don't might not want them to do.

207
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,240
Scott: and that is just a little bit.

208
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,066
Scott: You're not so great.

209
00:13:18,308 --> 00:13:19,780
Rym: your only argument is a slippery slope.

210
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,803
Rym: Then it's a logical fallacy.

211
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:24,795
Rym: it is it is slippery slope is only valid at all.

212
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:31,340
Scott: If you also have other evidence I know there's no evidence that it will you know slip down the slope.

213
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:36,400
Scott: But you know if we allow the government to do it opens a door less than it slips down.

214
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:37,408
Rym: What slope?

215
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:38,860
Rym: because basically?

216
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,340
Rym: I'm of the mind that a lot of what Comcast is doing amounts to among other things false advertise.

217
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:45,101
Scott: Oh, I see That's.

218
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:59,994
Scott: what I think is that Comcast should be punished but not by the FCC and a technological way But by you know, the criminal courts in a in a. that's not a criminal issue You know, they should be sued by the class-action lawsuit by the customers.

219
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:05,539
Scott: action lawsuits never amount to anything I know it's just wait for lawyers to get a lot of money If class-action lawsuits work.

220
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:12,409
Rym: I would take the opposite tack and say that I'm of the mind that this is the kind of thing the FCC Should have been doing all along and should be doing.

221
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,755
Rym: they shouldn't be censoring.

222
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:15,020
Rym: They shouldn't be regulating content.

223
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:19,312
Rym: They should only be regulating the means we get content the airwaves.

224
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:27,620
Scott: Yeah radio waves, which the same as the airwaves Yeah, but the other thing is I feel like the FCC should only deal with the wireless things and not so much the wired things.

225
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:28,343
Scott: Why?

226
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:32,340
Rym: that's an arbitrary distinction that you're making only because the wired things are more near and dear to you.

227
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:39,679
Scott: No, it's because if something's on a wire someone owns the wires and you don't have this issue where you need the government to step In yes

228
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,222
Rym: We tell

229
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:41,265
Scott: people how to use still

230
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:43,833
Rym: need the government stepping in because the regulation of

231
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:44,355
Scott: who

232
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:47,220
Rym: owns what wires where and who's allowed Or not allowed to put wires

233
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,152
Scott: Telephone wires, they're shared wires.

234
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:51,580
Scott: They're they're a public utility.

235
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,674
Scott: But right now, you know cable companies actually own all the wires that they put up.

236
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:59,373
Scott: It's it's an owned thing It's not a it's not a shared thing.

237
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:14,428
Rym: So it's sort of like, you know Civic they still use civic infrastructure they use the telephone poles and in fact cable modems and all these things are part of the reason why our telephone pole infrastructure is now on the verge of collapse because they're Well overextended as true.

238
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:22,095
Rym: Yes that that is why that that is actually the Specific point that I would make for the FCC being able to regulate this.

239
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:24,405
Scott: the other thing though Is that it's not all.

240
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:25,329
Scott: we're not com.

241
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:31,511
Scott: comcast specifically is actually is cable But you know not not every internet service provider is cable.

242
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:36,727
Rym: telephone don't use cable or telephone they use wire less And then the FCC gets it.

243
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,877
Scott: Yeah, but what if someone just gets a what is so?

244
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,800
Rym: it doesn't use wires?

245
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:43,668
Scott: Fiber that's not in a telephone pole.

246
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:44,651
Rym: So where do they put it?

247
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,857
Scott: It just goes to their neighbor.

248
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:47,378
Rym: how?

249
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,003
Rym: no You can.

250
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:49,806
Rym: actually you can do that.

251
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:51,191
Rym: Yeah, I'll tell you one thing though.

252
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:52,797
Rym: You're running pipe underground.

253
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:53,440
Rym: You got to do it.

254
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:56,868
Scott: Don't run copper Hell no hell.

255
00:15:56,908 --> 00:16:04,880
Rym: no we learned a somewhat famous story at RIT Where to a company had two buildings on the same site and they wanted to have Ethernet between the two.

256
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:10,120
Rym: So they just had a conduit run, you know between the two buildings under and they just sent cat5 through the wire.

257
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:13,077
Rym: No, no, no, they send big old, you know coaxial cables.

258
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:14,880
Rym: No, all right All right media converters on both ends.

259
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:22,247
Rym: It was a big deal like, you know Like the internet was there's a bridge on either end and then stuff that had to go across went across this big high bandwidth Link.

260
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:25,614
Rym: All right One of the buildings got struck by lightning.

261
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,866
Rym: Oh Yeah Copper cable connecting the two underground.

262
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,751
Scott: not good bad idea.

263
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:35,640
Scott: Yes, could they can they solve that though with some sort of surge protector thing?

264
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,522
Rym: You're better off.

265
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,880
Scott: Wait, I mean you need a big one for lightning, but you know, you coulda it's possible.

266
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,470
Rym: Anyway, there's actually it's a longer anecdote.

267
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,260
Rym: I don't want to get into all the technicalities of it because none of you care.

268
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:49,260
Scott: No, no one cares.

269
00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:59,520
Rym: It was actually part of an entire like one entire class worth of a case study of Poor decisions made by people who don't understand their amifications, huh?

270
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,086
Scott: I've never seen anything like that before in the.

271
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:05,292
Scott: you know, ITC s industry.

272
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:18,724
Rym: only every goddamn day Every way we're going to communicate will either need civic infrastructure public land right-of-way through private land or Regulation of the airwaves.

273
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:26,940
Rym: the only foreseeable place I could see no use for the FCC Would be quantum communication because it doesn't actually travel anywhere.

274
00:17:28,142 --> 00:17:28,745
Scott: Or does it?

275
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,191
Scott: or can you just not be sure I?

276
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,405
Scott: Mean, yeah FCC.

277
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:34,308
Scott: We're gonna take you to court.

278
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:38,501
Scott: you violated some quanta the Quanta Communication Act of 2012.

279
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:40,587
Scott: Can you prove that I in fact communicated?

280
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:45,380
Scott: I where we have this level of certainty that there was communication occurring?

281
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:51,240
Scott: My follow I can tell you either if you communicated or what you communicated but not both.

282
00:17:51,642 --> 00:18:03,978
Rym: My follow-on joke to what you said would have been but it's only Anyway bees of the day.

283
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,839
Scott: No, not the bees.

284
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:09,444
Rym: This is.

285
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:15,806
Rym: this is one of those rare things that's just so Perfectly formed and so hilarious.

286
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,189
Scott: just it's sort of like.

287
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,432
Scott: this is sort of.

288
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:22,744
Scott: it's good in the same sort of the same way That you can lift em.

289
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:23,666
Scott: Pokemon is good.

290
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:24,188
Rym: It's just.

291
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:31,635
Rym: it's such a simple joke, but it's executed flawlessly and The the mashup and just everything about it.

292
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:32,320
Rym: It comes together.

293
00:18:33,182 --> 00:18:33,665
Scott: Same thing that's.

294
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:35,980
Scott: the one thing is that in the age of the internet, right?

295
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,531
Scott: We've sort of lost the format of like.

296
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:41,282
Scott: the quick joke, you know of like, you know Like.

297
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:43,689
Scott: why did chicken cross the road to get the other side?

298
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:44,912
Rym: dinner is nothing but quick jokes.

299
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:46,016
Rym: I mean real.

300
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:47,500
Scott: I mean incredibly quick.

301
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:49,485
Rym: How many YouTube video?

302
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:53,240
Rym: how many videos in College Humor if they're more than a minute long people just don't bother.

303
00:18:53,662 --> 00:18:56,914
Scott: Yeah, but I'm saying I'm talking about this steak, you know a minute long.

304
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:57,516
Scott: That's that's.

305
00:18:57,656 --> 00:19:00,900
Scott: that's quick relative But that's not like this is super quick.

306
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,014
Scott: We're talking about the fives the one-liner the five-second, you know where those jokes are.

307
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:06,600
Rym: go too far go to something awful.

308
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:07,986
Rym: The joke is a picture.

309
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:08,508
Scott: Yep.

310
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:09,452
Scott: That's that's a good one.

311
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:11,400
Rym: Those are in fact thriving on the internet.

312
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,670
Rym: I poke holes and everything you just said anyway.

313
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,116
Rym: Anyway, this is just.

314
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:19,639
Rym: I Laughed so hard when I saw that I'm pretty hard.

315
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:24,175
Scott: I wasn't expecting so much and I got way more than I expected because

316
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:32,473
Rym: it was like it was done really well Especially with the zooming in and the fact that it was done like obviously filming a TV Which gives it this kind of extra edgy quality, but

317
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:34,160
Scott: it was done well enough where it didn't matter.

318
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,533
Rym: Plus the fact that the comedic timing cuz it's like alright, it's really funny.

319
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:46,740
Rym: That's done really well, but then the exact Precise comedic timing of the second thing that happens at the very end of the video.

320
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:49,780
Scott: Yeah, if the timing and this was off it would not work at all.

321
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:58,640
Rym: What are those things where you know, you ha ha ha ha and just as you're about to stop laughing They hit you with the one-two punch and you laugh even harder I think as I saw it coming because I know how that works.

322
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,800
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time you see it coming but then it hits and you still laugh for anyone.

323
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,790
Scott: It's a combination of this movie called the wicker man a movie.

324
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,296
Scott: I've never seen and know nothing about.

325
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:13,377
Scott: I think it has Nicolas Cage Okay, you can check IMDb for that and Megaman 3 hard man's level.

326
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:20,340
Scott: and well It doesn't matter if you've never seen the movie and it really actually doesn't matter if you've never played Megaman.

327
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:29,026
Scott: Okay, anyway, so I Don't know when you were a kid, right?

328
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:29,588
Scott: You would go to.

329
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:30,251
Scott: you know, there were.

330
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:32,120
Scott: there were these places called showbiz pizza.

331
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,368
Scott: It was a big chain in the in the old Midwest.

332
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:37,440
Rym: We had major magics, which was basically the same thing.

333
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,640
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I think I went to one of these places but it was called something else.

334
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,400
Scott: But I remember it's basically go and play arcade games as a kid, right?

335
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,929
Scott: But really really shitty get really shitty pizza.

336
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,640
Scott: and there's an animatronic, you know band that plays music.

337
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,280
Scott: You know your birthday party.

338
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,593
Scott: They like all your friends in there and you go watch the animatronic animal.

339
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,540
Rym: one of those places was around here today.

340
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:03,820
Rym: I would probably go there regularly because it'd probably be the best arcade around.

341
00:21:04,102 --> 00:21:13,567
Scott: Well if it had games like it did back in the day I mean nowadays to go to a Chuck E Cheese and all the games like crane games and toss the ball in the hole games And stomp the spider.

342
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:16,180
Rym: I remember playing crossbow at my major magics.

343
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:20,639
Scott: Yeah, you know these places don't have DDR and Mortal Kombat 2 anymore.

344
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,599
Scott: Anyway - yeah or virtual on.

345
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,914
Scott: So, you know those animatronic animals and I was a kid.

346
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:30,420
Scott: They scared the fuck out.

347
00:21:30,681 --> 00:21:31,967
Scott: I was I didn't.

348
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:37,294
Scott: oh, they didn't really didn't scare me so much that run away But they were sort of annoying and painful to look at.

349
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:38,440
Scott: I didn't enjoy them at all.

350
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,330
Scott: And I wondered why other kids did enjoy them.

351
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:45,320
Rym: or if they even enjoyed them, you know It might have been at this kind of mass hysteria where kids are at a birthday party.

352
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:48,391
Rym: They see all the other kids losing their shit about the dancing.

353
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:48,953
Rym: We never lie.

354
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:50,960
Scott: I don't remember anyone losing their shit about it.

355
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:54,535
Rym: I remember seeing little kids jumping up and down and clapping and Jerry.

356
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,560
Scott: Yeah, I don't remember that.

357
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,980
Rym: But of course I remember usually my parents would make us sit there and watch the thing and as soon as it was done I would grab my tokens and make a beeline.

358
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:03,520
Rym: Exactly

359
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:15,140
Scott: It always felt like the kind of thing that adults thought kids would like but kids didn't actually like and they made us sit Or at all, I guess when I was a little bit older like maybe six It sort of felt like a thing that was for three-year-olds and I was too old.

360
00:22:15,563 --> 00:22:17,679
Scott: I always felt too old for it no matter how old I was.

361
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:29,125
Scott: But anyway, some dude right he collected like a full set of these animatronic, you know Musicians and actually, you know, the place was called showbiz pizza But the animals were called.

362
00:22:29,345 --> 00:22:33,179
Scott: the band that the animals comprised was the rock of fire explosion.

363
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,058
Rym: now I can say with almost certainty that I saw some of these exact same things.

364
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:38,680
Rym: that major man.

365
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,904
Scott: I've definitely seen some of them.

366
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:47,834
Scott: So this guy collected the full set of these animatronic animals like in his house Yes, I think like in his garage or something or like a rented space.

367
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,260
Rym: Anyway, not the animatronics.

368
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:51,332
Scott: He fixed them all up.

369
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:52,300
Scott: He set them all up.

370
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,000
Scott: The whole thing is pretty much in as working as well as it perhaps better than the day it was made.

371
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:13,699
Scott: he fixed the whole thing and what he does is you go to his website and You make a bid you pick a song and you offer some money and if someone else offers money for the same song that's a total money for that song goes up and Whichever song has the most money going for it.

372
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:23,298
Scott: He choreographs the animatronic animals to play that modern awesome song or maybe people think an old song I don't know and then he puts the video on YouTube and then you pay him.

373
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:32,433
Scott: and As Much as I hated these animals as a kid and thought they were stupid and didn't get it and everything I watch this now and there's something about it.

374
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,960
Scott: That's just really awesome.

375
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:34,322
Scott: I don't.

376
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:35,628
Scott: I don't know what it is, but it like.

377
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:39,457
Scott: it feels great to watch these animals part of it Play modern pop songs.

378
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:48,520
Rym: I think appeals to the hacker and all of us because it takes is that Had those things you can bet we would be doing awesome things with them.

379
00:23:48,782 --> 00:23:54,880
Scott: I guess it's sort of it's like I get the same enjoyment I get if I like watch people play rock band really awesomely, you know.

380
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,680
Rym: See there's more to it though because maybe for children of the 80s more so than anything else.

381
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:06,680
Rym: I remember that animatronics were kind of the symbol and icon of the economic prosperity of my child.

382
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:14,960
Scott: Well, that's definitely true because I remember right now a day when I was that young I didn't appreciate you know What the economy was good economy?

383
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:19,798
Rym: Children of the 80s we really came up like children of the 70s came of age in the 80s.

384
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:21,134
Rym: We were children of the 80s.

385
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,605
Rym: We came of age in the 90s.

386
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:29,471
Rym: in the 90s if you went to any mall in them in America We're at least outside of I guess the back ist of water.

387
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:32,280
Rym: Yeah, there were animatronics in every mall.

388
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,658
Scott: There's a mall over in Jersey on the other side of Tappan Zee Bridge called the Palisades Park, whatever right?

389
00:24:37,698 --> 00:24:38,120
Scott: It's huge.

390
00:24:38,382 --> 00:24:40,278
Scott: They built it sort of like at the.

391
00:24:40,298 --> 00:24:44,034
Scott: yeah They built it at like the peak of economic awesomeness in the u.s.

392
00:24:44,074 --> 00:24:46,766
Scott: Like, you know less than 10 years ago I mean the mall was huge.

393
00:24:46,806 --> 00:24:49,980
Scott: this mall when I went to and it was new it had a Dave and Busters.

394
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:58,224
Scott: Right now only to have a Dave and Busters It had a Chuck E. Cheese Discovery Zone equivalent place with the biggest set of tubes and balls I've ever seen.

395
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:00,920
Rym: you know big ball pit lakeside ball when I was a kid near.

396
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:10,861
Rym: Not only did they have an arcade that was awesome and not only did they have like I'm not even done yet like multiple amusement park like Restaurants.

397
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:14,092
Rym: they had water slides in the mall.

398
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,580
Scott: All right, this wall this wall had a ferris wheel in it.

399
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,929
Scott: I'm pretty sure it had a rainforest cafe.

400
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:19,833
Scott: Remember that shit.

401
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,580
Scott: I remember that animatronics in there.

402
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:25,820
Scott: They had a Disney store full animatronics at Warner Brothers store full animatronics.

403
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:28,046
Scott: They had this NASCAR place.

404
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:44,019
Scott: you can go to NASCAR Silicon Valley Motor Speedway, and it was basically full-size NASCAR's with projectors in front of the screen and little tiny screens in the rearview mirrors and hydraulics lifting the things up and you paid 10 bucks to do like one track and it was a wreck.

405
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:49,540
Scott: it was a Replication of a real track and he drove just like a. you know, it's calibrated to be just like a real NASCAR.

406
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:50,589
Scott: I've had a business.

407
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:52,000
Rym: we've all had VR stuff.

408
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,040
Rym: I remember you'd go and ride like for five or six bucks like a VR roller coaster.

409
00:25:56,241 --> 00:26:02,680
Rym: Actually a lot of them they had VR like first-person shooters where you and a bunch of friends would just play an FPS in the semi.

410
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,683
Rym: VR there's actually Really?

411
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:10,799
Scott: I kind of wouldn't mind doing that today and nowadays all those things are gone and only now can I appreciate that.

412
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:17,973
Scott: the reason We had all those things during that time period during the Clinton era It was because the economy was awesome.

413
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,020
Scott: and now the economy sucks.

414
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:22,714
Scott: We have none of those things, but at the same time the economy's sucking.

415
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:24,541
Rym: we we over the weekend We went.

416
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:25,485
Scott: those things are a waste.

417
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:26,771
Scott: We shouldn't have spent our money on them.

418
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:28,398
Scott: Maybe the economy wouldn't suck now.

419
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:38,746
Rym: Yes Oh, you always saw in malls Was that three rings like three concentric rings and you'd kind of crucify yourself in the middle and then it would spin you around Something a gyro.

420
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:39,791
Scott: Yeah, whatever it is.

421
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,680
Rym: Cuz the thing is that was actually exercise.

422
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:46,720
Rym: It wasn't just like a ride like you could actually control the thing by tensing muscles and shifting your weight.

423
00:26:47,121 --> 00:26:49,811
Rym: Yep, I know this only because I did it a lot.

424
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:52,320
Scott: I don't call it a gyroscope, but it's a gyro.

425
00:26:53,842 --> 00:26:54,709
Scott: It's a gyro something.

426
00:26:54,729 --> 00:27:02,005
Rym: Let's just call it a da Vinci All right, so I'm of the mind that they're.

427
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:05,719
Rym: they're neither moral nor legal implications to just totally stealing someone's Wi-Fi.

428
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:12,520
Scott: I'm of the mind that there are no legal implications that I know of but you know, it's questionable.

429
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:13,102
Scott: It's like.

430
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:15,932
Scott: I don't think there should be and I don't think there are.

431
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:18,120
Scott: but there might be legal implications.

432
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:23,319
Scott: but I think there is a Somewhat moral implication to just stealing someone's Wi-Fi.

433
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:28,839
Rym: I don't think morals should be a factor at all because in technology issues, we should only discuss the technology.

434
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:37,068
Scott: Well, if you only want to discuss the technology Wi-Fi works people leave them open you can connect to them But all the more there more is there.

435
00:27:37,108 --> 00:27:45,380
Rym: there's a lot of people feel as though it is somehow a Crime or it should be a crime to connect to an unencrypted Wi-Fi.

436
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:53,991
Scott: Well, here's the only reason why I feel sort of in line with the moral argument of connecting to an unencrypted Wi-Fi That you just find a right.

437
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:55,859
Scott: All right So just any it doesn't.

438
00:27:56,484 --> 00:27:59,988
Scott: First of all, there's a difference between you know One open Wi-Fi and another.

439
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:07,300
Scott: if I go to the park and there's a sign in the park This is free Wi-Fi here and I open up my laptop and I see one with the ESS ID of free Wi-Fi.

440
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:08,605
Scott: That's okay.

441
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:09,669
Scott: Obviously, it's okay.

442
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:14,044
Scott: if I go to hotel and it says free Wi-Fi and I connect to it It's obviously okay.

443
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:16,031
Rym: right now by the same token.

444
00:28:16,091 --> 00:28:16,954
Rym: I remember one case.

445
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:22,551
Rym: we were out visiting our friend Pete Yep, and we drove way up and he wasn't around.

446
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:28,872
Rym: so we just kind of sat in this park next to there's like one house There and Scott notices that there's Wi-Fi.

447
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:30,718
Rym: Yeah, obviously coming from this one house.

448
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:34,091
Rym: Yep So we connect to it see that there's a computer.

449
00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:36,460
Rym: we see that as an unprotected Windows share.

450
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:39,053
Rym: We made a text file explaining how to secure Wi-Fi.

451
00:28:39,073 --> 00:28:40,098
Rym: We put it on the C Drive.

452
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,907
Scott: Yeah We did.

453
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:51,834
Scott: we did indeed but see here's the thing To you the best example I have and I said this in the forum But I don't think you know, everyone who's listening to this read that forum post right.

454
00:28:52,276 --> 00:28:53,380
Scott: imagine for a second.

455
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:56,760
Scott: I think our opinion is largely shaped by the fact that we live in the United States.

456
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,743
Scott: Imagine for a second.

457
00:28:57,763 --> 00:28:58,566
Scott: We were in Australia.

458
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:02,300
Scott: people in Australia when they buy internet access, right?

459
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,500
Scott: They get a limited amount of bandwidth, you know X gigabytes per gigabits per month.

460
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:11,839
Scott: And if they use that up, they have to start paying an exorbitant fee for every, you know bit they go over.

461
00:29:12,582 --> 00:29:15,273
Scott: So let's say you have someone in Australia and they're dumb.

462
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:16,880
Scott: They set up wireless for their laptop.

463
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,795
Scott: They got that far but they were too dumb to set up.

464
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:22,600
Scott: You know the security on it, right?

465
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:27,113
Scott: Which is something you would definitely want to do if you had limited bandwidth.

466
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:32,678
Scott: because if someone random person used all your bandwidth now suddenly you can't use your internet without paying a crazy fee.

467
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:42,769
Scott: and You know if you go in Australia and you see an access point named links is one two three Odds are right.

468
00:29:43,111 --> 00:29:49,040
Scott: being a technological person You know, the odds are a stupid person set that up and didn't know better, right?

469
00:29:50,242 --> 00:29:53,170
Scott: And if you use that you know that odds are.

470
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:59,160
Scott: a person that's dumb like that is not the kind of person who's paying the Extra money for the unlimited bandwidth in Australia.

471
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:08,216
Scott: So if you use their bandwidth, you're actually taking significant stuff out of their wallet Without their explicit permission.

472
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:13,940
Scott: and in there I think there is a slight grounds for a moral implication that you probably shouldn't be doing that.

473
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,041
Rym: now.

474
00:30:14,282 --> 00:30:21,900
Rym: the reason I definitely say there shouldn't be a legal implication and I Scott and I actually have argued about this a lot over the years

475
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:22,903
Scott: And

476
00:30:22,984 --> 00:30:27,099
Rym: our opinions have kind of moved toward the center a little bit a little bit a little

477
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:27,299
Scott: bit

478
00:30:28,102 --> 00:30:42,408
Rym: but basically I am leery of any time where in using a technology or engaging with the technological device that you have to have some sort of implicit or Subjective like.

479
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:53,140
Rym: you have to somehow Assertained the intention or the intent if I may Of the person on the other end that if I'm communicating with someone there's the information we're exchanging.

480
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:59,120
Rym: I shouldn't have to make some sort of meta calculation as to what they are intending to exchange.

481
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,120
Rym: Yeah, for example you did make that distinction.

482
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:08,380
Rym: You have basically broken the trust of protocols on the internet and made everything subject to legal action here.

483
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:10,029
Scott: Think about this for a second, right?

484
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,940
Scott: Someone has a web server, right?

485
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:14,187
Scott: I can ask that web server.

486
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,640
Scott: I can say get index study HTML and that web server sends me index that HTML.

487
00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:19,945
Scott: It just does it.

488
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,315
Scott: there's no person making a decision on the other end.

489
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:23,399
Scott: What if someone?

490
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:29,419
Scott: Accidentally set up a web server and I'm using their bandwidth when I get data from their web server, right?

491
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:30,257
Scott: You know.

492
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,017
Scott: But it's implied sort of when you set up a web server on the internet that you want people to visit it.

493
00:31:36,178 --> 00:31:39,763
Rym: now see the reason It's implied is because it's a specific Protocol.

494
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:49,784
Rym: the protocol is that if you want to accept these kinds of connections When a certain kind of request comes in then if you don't respond nothing happens, but the fact that I ask it Hey web server.

495
00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:52,633
Rym: Can I look at you and it says hello Rym?

496
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:53,917
Rym: Here is some information.

497
00:31:53,937 --> 00:31:54,800
Rym: Would you like some more?

498
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:55,590
Scott: Mm-hmm.

499
00:31:55,961 --> 00:32:11,167
Rym: And in that case if you if anyone ever argues that we should have to worry about the intent of the person who set up a technology then in that case Legally you could be in trouble for visiting a website just because someone put it online But they don't actually want anyone to look at it

500
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,537
Scott: even though they didn't set up the security on it

501
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:14,140
Rym: now.

502
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:18,040
Rym: That's why a lot of people use the analogy with Wi-Fi of the open door.

503
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:28,420
Rym: ah, well if someone just you know forgets to lock their doors that'll give you the legal right to steal everything in their house and The reason is it's not a good analogy at all with Wi-Fi.

504
00:32:28,522 --> 00:32:33,210
Scott: This this Discussion is ripe for a million broken analogies.

505
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:39,880
Scott: pretty much all people do when they have this argument is throw analogies Like there's that analogies enough to like bury a city.

506
00:32:41,223 --> 00:32:42,552
Rym: But it's like an analogy.

507
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:45,345
Rym: you see no But no, it's.

508
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:48,120
Rym: it's not like leaving your door open if someone walks in and takes your stuff.

509
00:32:48,762 --> 00:32:57,839
Rym: It is much more analogous to you go to the store and you see a sign and the sign says Free lemonade come on in help yourself.

510
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:00,519
Rym: But you don't understand what the sign says.

511
00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:06,060
Rym: But you choose to buy it anyway because you need something to patch a hole in your front in the front of your house.

512
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,338
Rym: There's a hole in your front in your house.

513
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:13,613
Rym: So you put it over the hole because you just you bought it to cover that hole But you can't read so you don't realize that.

514
00:33:13,734 --> 00:33:19,574
Rym: on the on the hole now It says please come in making this algae way too complicated because that's exactly what it's like.

515
00:33:19,594 --> 00:33:23,068
Rym: remember when you buy wireless access point You buy it because you want to.

516
00:33:23,108 --> 00:33:23,993
Rym: you want to do something.

517
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:25,160
Rym: you have an intent in mind.

518
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:28,440
Rym: You want to have your internet around your house, but you're dumb.

519
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:32,079
Rym: So you don't know all the other things that this product does.

520
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:37,345
Rym: So I'm buying this sign to do one thing to cover the hole in my wall But I don't know the other thing.

521
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:38,368
Rym: it does the thing.

522
00:33:38,428 --> 00:33:40,053
Rym: it explicitly does the thing.

523
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:42,722
Rym: it tells me outright that it does That.

524
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:44,471
Rym: it says all are welcome.

525
00:33:44,552 --> 00:33:46,305
Rym: Come on in free lemonade Mm-hmm.

526
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:52,419
Rym: So in that case if I see a house with the door open and a sign that says free lemonade come on in.

527
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:57,539
Rym: I Believe that I'm perfectly within my rights to walk into that house unannounced and take some lemonade.

528
00:33:58,061 --> 00:34:03,020
Rym: Yeah, now it's a little bit more dubious if I decide to also take the safe full of money.

529
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:05,992
Rym: Yeah, in fact you could argue that that is wrong because you were.

530
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:13,040
Rym: the sign explicitly said free lemonade But you're allowed to come in you're allowed to take the lemonade and you're allowed to leave and you're allowed to linger.

531
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:19,868
Scott: Well, well think about the situation where the guy What he did was he put up the.

532
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:26,839
Scott: the two people put something on Craigslist that said come to this address I'm giving you everything away for free and it was some other guy's house.

533
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:32,585
Scott: So it's as if the guy had a free lemonade sign in his house But he didn't put it up.

534
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:36,080
Scott: someone else put it up when he wasn't looking and everyone but at the same time.

535
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:37,387
Rym: What are the specifics?

536
00:34:37,428 --> 00:34:39,360
Rym: the first person who showed up was the house unlocked?

537
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,666
Scott: It must have been.

538
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:42,170
Rym: I don't know.

539
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:49,059
Rym: see because From what I read about that story I get the impression that people showed up and then broke in.

540
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:49,904
Scott: That's what if.

541
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:56,188
Scott: and then they were like angry when the guy said hey don't take my shit And then they waved the Craigslist papers in his face as if to see.

542
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:00,300
Rym: now that is two different situations because here's a not an analogy.

543
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:06,826
Rym: But take the example of a Cisco router that the company sets up like say I run joy Jojo Shabba do soft incorporated.

544
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:08,411
Rym: so I have a router.

545
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:11,300
Rym: now say I'm dumb and I don't set up my security, right?

546
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,232
Rym: So you can tell that to my router and it said it lets you log in.

547
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,000
Rym: now say I put a banner.

548
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:16,771
Rym: I'm smart enough.

549
00:35:16,812 --> 00:35:17,380
Rym: I put a banner.

550
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:22,692
Rym: So when you get to the telnet screen It says clearly this router is the property of so-and-so.

551
00:35:22,712 --> 00:35:25,320
Rym: you are not and no one is entitled to go any further.

552
00:35:25,461 --> 00:35:27,293
Rym: Unauthorized access blah blah blah blah.

553
00:35:27,313 --> 00:35:31,660
Rym: I Don't think you have the right to continue beyond at that point.

554
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,560
Scott: Yeah, I think that's been made pretty clear in the past.

555
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:43,380
Rym: But you can I know but you could not say by visiting this site you have hereby agreed to the following terms Not have known the terms before you arrived.

556
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:49,319
Rym: So that say someone will I you know I put up my lemonade sign and then someone walks in and goes to take my lemonade.

557
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:54,320
Rym: I think I have the right to say hey, who are you get the fuck out?

558
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:01,891
Rym: And then they say hey, but your sign says free lemonade to which I say well the signs wrong get out And then I think the person has to leave my button.

559
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:02,172
Rym: No.

560
00:36:02,212 --> 00:36:03,960
Rym: No, this is this is my opinion the law.

561
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:05,785
Rym: It's pretty clear what the law says.

562
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:10,420
Rym: but my opinion regardless of the law is that in the Craigslist case?

563
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:15,136
Rym: If the owner of their property said to leave the moment those Craigslist people Craigslist people didn't leave.

564
00:36:15,497 --> 00:36:16,280
Rym: they are now in violation.

565
00:36:17,103 --> 00:36:20,395
Rym: But the person at fault is the person who posted the faulty thing in the first place.

566
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:24,808
Rym: in the case of the Wi-Fi The person who owns the house also posted the faulty sign.

567
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:25,711
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

568
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:35,700
Scott: However, here's the thing is that is It is commonly understood, you know that when someone sets up a website without security on it They want people to visit it.

569
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,724
Scott: That's sort of the default.

570
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:38,772
Scott: is that people want you to visit their websites.

571
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:45,780
Scott: when people set up Wi-Fi The default is you know, most people don't even realize that it's something other people are going to use.

572
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,708
Rym: But again, that's only because you're making assumptions.

573
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:51,075
Rym: You have to assume the it is an assumption.

574
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:54,532
Scott: However, I Found that it's mostly true.

575
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:56,644
Scott: people who set up Wi-Fi They don't know what they're doing.

576
00:36:56,664 --> 00:37:02,748
Scott: people set up a web server know what they're doing generally say So it's like the reality.

577
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:03,090
Scott: It's like.

578
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:11,800
Scott: I know the reality of the world is thus Even though I can't basing it on assumptions ruins a lot of things, but this brings up the more important point.

579
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:17,440
Rym: What about the old adage stupid should be painful is I think it should be pain?

580
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,020
Rym: I feel as though now obviously but on the other that's obviously it's a it's a sliding scale.

581
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,927
Rym: There's a is there's no black and white.

582
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:27,617
Rym: there is a line between moral and immoral.

583
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:32,155
Rym: now granted There should not be a line or a gray area between legal and illegal.

584
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:40,095
Rym: It should be a very clear line Yes, but in terms of morality, you know There's a fine line and I think that there's a certain level of due diligence.

585
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:51,156
Rym: in any situation Wi-Fi whatever any possible situation that a human could put themselves or others into There is a head in every case a level of due diligence for all parties.

586
00:37:51,176 --> 00:37:58,040
Rym: that is required And I have the feeling that if you do not put forth that due diligence, then you do not have the right to recourse.

587
00:37:58,221 --> 00:37:59,490
Scott: All right, but here's the thing right.

588
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,920
Scott: stupid should be painful.

589
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:06,940
Scott: I you know that that level of the argument I have to agree with the thing is stupid should not be deadly.

590
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:07,845
Scott: Well, no, no.

591
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:10,800
Scott: No, I'm just saying I'm just saying in this context stupid should be painful.

592
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,262
Scott: not it.

593
00:38:11,362 --> 00:38:25,554
Scott: not as a general not as a general rule and for the universe maybe kind of itchy - right but Should it even if stupid should be painful if you are not stupid and you intentionally go about Dole ing out pain to the stupid.

594
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:38,033
Rym: Yes, that's That's morally questionable, but at the same time I don't think it is that unjustified to expect a do a level of due diligence of?

595
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:43,254
Scott: I click on WEP But they don't even know that much.

596
00:38:43,496 --> 00:38:44,762
Scott: It doesn't mean it You know what?

597
00:38:44,962 --> 00:39:00,134
Rym: I hate to say this but I'm of the mind more and more that with certain with technology if you cannot Function with the technology on it's on a most basic level and put forth the minimal due diligence That you have no business using seg technology.

598
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:01,160
Rym: and take the example of a car.

599
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:05,380
Rym: You don't need to understand the intricacies of a internal combustion engine.

600
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:09,240
Rym: You don't need to understand the chemical composition of automatic transmission fluid.

601
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:12,575
Rym: You don't even know have to know how to change your own oil.

602
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,680
Rym: I'm fine with that.

603
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:16,400
Rym: We're in a society where you know people need cars.

604
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:21,819
Rym: Not everyone needs to be an expert of cars But you need to know what the gas pedal does.

605
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:25,534
Rym: You need to know what the brake pedal does if you don't lock your car doors.

606
00:39:25,594 --> 00:39:26,056
Rym: tough shit.

607
00:39:26,076 --> 00:39:26,759
Rym: if someone steals it.

608
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,132
Scott: I know some shit.

609
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:29,514
Scott: if someone steals it All right.

610
00:39:29,922 --> 00:39:41,632
Rym: If you leave the car Unlocked with the keys in it and the windows down and the sign says please take free car or even if it doesn't say free Car while it's still wrong to steal it The police are probably not going to care very much.

611
00:39:41,893 --> 00:39:44,989
Scott: and the insurance so they don't care very much Even if someone steals it hardcore.

612
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,740
Rym: In fact, I'm not an insurance lawyer.

613
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:55,703
Rym: I'm not a lawyer But I would bet your insurance wouldn't cover it if that if you left the windows If you let your car unlocked and the keys in your insurance isn't gonna cover it They probably won't.

614
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:56,928
Rym: you didn't do your due diligence.

615
00:39:56,988 --> 00:40:10,640
Rym: No, I honestly feel that encrypted that either enabling security or in the very least making the SSID say Private or something something any indication way.

616
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,664
Scott: So if the what if you?

617
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:17,280
Scott: what if you found a public Wi-Fi right and the SSID said private What if it was you know?

618
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:20,955
Scott: Like private Joe and his he was a private in the army or something and they would just.

619
00:40:21,136 --> 00:40:22,140
Scott: he said I'll call it private.

620
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,906
Scott: Cuz that's what I am.

621
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:24,860
Rym: and see now this this is the sliding scale.

622
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,851
Scott: You're just sitting there and all you see is the word private.

623
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,299
Scott: Do you feel would you click on that?

624
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,049
Rym: See now me personally.

625
00:40:30,392 --> 00:40:31,257
Rym: if I needed internet.

626
00:40:31,277 --> 00:40:33,385
Rym: Yes Internet I'd break a web.

627
00:40:33,786 --> 00:40:35,009
Rym: that's entirely different argument.

628
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,880
Rym: I need internet access and I and I find it I'll break the web.

629
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,905
Rym: It's not that hard to do.

630
00:40:39,925 --> 00:40:41,030
Scott: need two laptops though.

631
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,504
Rym: Yeah, actually you can get away with one Can you?

632
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,340
Scott: I used to used to need two to make it easy.

633
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,745
Scott: But anyway, cuz there's

634
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:50,560
Rym: a bunch of exploits now where you can just basically get the server to dump a bunch of data at you

635
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:57,180
Scott: And she go I should get one of those things anyway Cuz most people using WPA now anyway those

636
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,640
Rym: Forgetting the legal argument which I feel private probably wouldn't mean anything because it doesn't explicitly say you can't connect.

637
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,292
Scott: Well, but this there's the other argument this with it with the wireless protocol.

638
00:41:07,312 --> 00:41:09,700
Scott: There's nowhere to put a message before.

639
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:21,760
Scott: Yes You have to allow people to connect then do the thing that all the hotels do where they forward all your HTTP traffic to one Page that has the terms and then have the second level of connection with the Mac filtering in the whole business.

640
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:24,333
Rym: Yes, but you see there is still a facility.

641
00:41:24,374 --> 00:41:24,876
Rym: It's called WEP.

642
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:28,108
Rym: Yep, there's also the argument.

643
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:32,363
Rym: I mean, you know I say implicit and explicit but Legal aside.

644
00:41:32,584 --> 00:41:38,248
Rym: I think the only legal way to deal with it is simply if you don't protect your Wi-Fi It's open.

645
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,059
Rym: It's fair business.

646
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:47,033
Rym: But in terms of morality the more like if it says please don't use or private It's a little less morally justifiable to use it.

647
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:51,850
Rym: if it's a weapon cryptid It's about 80% morally unjustifiable to use it.

648
00:41:52,171 --> 00:41:55,320
Rym: if this is WPA you're at about 99% but you won't break it anyway.

649
00:41:55,423 --> 00:42:13,034
Scott: So yeah I think also in the United States the moral just the moral qualms are less because internet access is less Value, so it's still stealing on in principle in some way I believe legal term is not actually stealing because bandwidth is free and that's how I get.

650
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:14,960
Rym: it is trespass to Chatel, right?

651
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:15,823
Scott: But you're it.

652
00:42:15,863 --> 00:42:26,440
Scott: the amount of damage is so small somewhere like the UK The amount of damage you will cause is much much higher and I think therefore the moral qualm while saint.

653
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,869
Scott: Well, it's the same moral qualm in principle.

654
00:42:29,331 --> 00:42:31,600
Scott: It is far more damage that you are causing.

655
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,202
Scott: So it's like.

656
00:42:32,463 --> 00:42:35,874
Scott: it's like the difference between like, okay if you you know

657
00:42:36,235 --> 00:42:36,777
Rym: have one

658
00:42:36,837 --> 00:42:47,840
Scott: lock on your door But it's really flimsy and I sort of just open the door walk in spin around and walk out versus you know Open the door knock a bunch of stuff over and break it and walk out.

659
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,007
Scott: It's like okay in but in principle I did the same thing the breaking and entering.

660
00:42:52,328 --> 00:43:00,280
Scott: but in one the amount of damage I did was get your floor dirty And in the other one the amount of damage I did was break things and it's just more damage.

661
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,500
Scott: So it's like if you're okay stealing a candy bar, but you're not okay stealing a car.

662
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:07,537
Scott: That's the difference between doing it in the US doing it in Australia.

663
00:43:07,577 --> 00:43:07,939
Scott: at the same

664
00:43:07,979 --> 00:43:19,413
Rym: time I'm kind of sad that you don't argue the legal aspect of it anymore because I have my killer point which is they're Broadcasting their wireless signal their radio waves into public property

665
00:43:19,453 --> 00:43:19,633
Scott: where

666
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:28,495
Rym: I am and it's legal for me to what look at take pictures of observe Anything that I can see or hear from private from public property

667
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:37,240
Scott: and it is legal for you according to the FCC with your radio in your Computer to broadcast from that radio whatever signals you want.

668
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:47,351
Scott: Yeah So you're allowed to look at all the radio signals coming out in in the open air in public property and you're allowed to Broadcast these particular radio signals in public property.

669
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:49,920
Scott: thus and that level that's all you're doing.

670
00:43:50,201 --> 00:44:09,496
Rym: So they're saying that it's illegal or it should be illegal to access someone's unencrypted unprotected wireless You know without having any sort of explicit Way of knowing not to is the same as saying that I could put a picture like a poster in my front yard But make it illegal for you to look at it or take pictures of it.

671
00:44:09,657 --> 00:44:22,480
Scott: Hmm Well, I think the difference there is that you know taking pictures of the thing doesn't do any damage to you Whereas, you know when okay, sure you're broadcasting the waves themselves into the air.

672
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:31,236
Rym: But the result of those waves is also Exclusively defined by the protocol and you have allowed the protocol to make these decisions.

673
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:32,320
Scott: Yeah, what about that guy?

674
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,140
Scott: Remember that story the guys who were in the Home Depot parking lot and they got on the Home Depot Network.

675
00:44:36,281 --> 00:44:37,151
Scott: Remember those guys.

676
00:44:37,171 --> 00:44:46,210
Scott: Oh, yeah Yes, they got in trouble not just for the credit card ceiling that they were doing which is definitely a little but they got in Trouble for the infiltrating of the company network.

677
00:44:46,611 --> 00:44:47,455
Rym: See what was that?

678
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:48,338
Rym: encrypted or not?

679
00:44:48,398 --> 00:44:48,900
Rym: I don't remember.

680
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,763
Scott: I don't think it was.

681
00:44:50,084 --> 00:44:54,380
Scott: I think it was Home Depot being stupid and having open wireless access points on there.

682
00:44:54,642 --> 00:44:56,960
Rym: You know store network, you know, here's here's another point now.

683
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,299
Rym: This is not to argue in favor of stealing things from people or doing bad or not.

684
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:02,478
Scott: Remembering that's.

685
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:15,440
Rym: There's also the point of due diligence is not shouldn't just be this thing that everyone has to do in order to kind of put Themselves above blame or like I at least did my due diligence.

686
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:17,627
Rym: Right, it's not my fight like there's nothing.

687
00:45:17,647 --> 00:45:23,224
Scott: due diligence is usually now my insurance will help me out because I did the due diligence Yes, but it's also the.

688
00:45:23,605 --> 00:45:30,376
Rym: I feel as though a lot of people have forgotten especially in America and in the West where you know Generally our lives are pretty good and personal

689
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:30,820
Scott: responsibility

690
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:58,775
Rym: But no, but just the fact that we live generally very affluent very well-off lives and a lot of people do but Everyone there's a certain level of due diligence you should do not because other people tell you to but because you only have one life and Even though people shouldn't do bad things to you A lot of people do bad things and you should take the due diligence Required to protect yourself from other people as best you can.

691
00:45:59,177 --> 00:46:04,620
Rym: for example I don't I'm not a paranoid nutter runs around with four guns than a taser and a security system.

692
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:16,757
Rym: No, you're around six guns, but at the same time I Wouldn't go to sleep naked in the middle of Grand Central or not Grand Central in the middle of Central Park at night.

693
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,044
Rym: I Wouldn't just sleep naked overnight in a remote part of Grand Central Central Park.

694
00:46:22,164 --> 00:46:23,448
Scott: assuming that that wasn't illegal.

695
00:46:23,488 --> 00:46:27,239
Rym: being naked in public to begin with fine with it with a sock over my nuts, right?

696
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,469
Rym: Assume how it's legal.

697
00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:29,400
Scott: I love that right?

698
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,589
Scott: Assuming that as legal in the first place, right?

699
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,620
Scott: You're putting yourself in incredible danger.

700
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,202
Scott: It's sort of an

701
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:37,386
Rym: at-your-own-risk

702
00:46:37,426 --> 00:46:46,880
Scott: situation and it's like sure if someone comes and you know Mugs you or assaults you because you're naked in the park at night, you know on the one hand

703
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:55,056
Rym: Illegal the police should have protected you because they weren't there The police should follow up and all that but at the same time you could have trivially protected yourself.

704
00:46:55,317 --> 00:46:56,300
Scott: You could have indeed.

705
00:46:57,185 --> 00:47:04,760
Rym: So I just feel as though when it comes to technology The level of due diligence that is expected of people needs to be a little bit higher.

706
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:11,788
Rym: Yeah, I'm not saying it needs to be at the level of a technology professional But protect yourself a little bit.

707
00:47:12,049 --> 00:47:26,920
Rym: know at least something if you're if you set up a wireless access point And you're 70 years old and you don't even know what it does or how it works That's no different than if I get in a car But I've never driven a car before and I just start hitting pedals and turning things on the freeway.

708
00:47:27,241 --> 00:47:28,827
Scott: Yeah, and I mean a lot of Pete.

709
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:37,040
Scott: the other problem right is that there's a lot of people out there in the world Right who know enough about technology to be dangerous, right?

710
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,976
Scott: It's like an old person has no idea what to do with the wireless access point.

711
00:47:39,996 --> 00:47:40,740
Scott: They don't even know it works.

712
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,744
Scott: They don't even know it exists.

713
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:44,999
Scott: They get their smart, you know grandkid to set it up.

714
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:54,240
Scott: The grandkid knows enough to follow the instructions and set it up But they don't know about web for WPA or Mac filtering or routing or net or anything.

715
00:47:54,522 --> 00:48:07,387
Scott: They know just enough to be dangerous but they don't know really enough to get the job done right fully from beginning to end and that is why we have a lot of things like unprotected windows boxes.

716
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:09,152
Scott: and you know people.

717
00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:20,137
Scott: they know how to install software and configure their computers But they don't know enough to watch out for malware how to tell the difference in malware and perfectly Okay where and that that that's really the dangerous situation that we're in now.

718
00:48:20,218 --> 00:48:35,380
Scott: and I Don't really don't have a lot of confidence unless we start, you know, adding a fifth subject to all public schools in computer technology That anyone is ever and we have you know People being like me being paid enough to teach that class in every school

719
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,560
Rym: Now I would use is one I've been using for a long time and I think it's still perfectly relevant.

720
00:48:40,122 --> 00:48:44,596
Rym: The internet and technology today is a lot like the Wild West one.

721
00:48:44,696 --> 00:48:50,294
Rym: everyone says the one yes But think about it on a very on a more literal, you know, take the metaphor really seriously.

722
00:48:50,655 --> 00:48:55,130
Rym: So there are laws Sheriffs, there are laws and sheriffs out there.

723
00:48:55,170 --> 00:49:01,080
Rym: Sometimes the sheriff's are killed in cold blood But not only art like the movie 310 to humor or any of those, you know Western movies.

724
00:49:01,301 --> 00:49:10,200
Rym: So there are laws and the laws applied just like the laws out in the east where there are police everywhere But at the same time there's not a lot of people to enforce those laws.

725
00:49:10,501 --> 00:49:12,228
Rym: There's not a lot of people to help you out.

726
00:49:12,328 --> 00:49:18,968
Rym: if someone else breaks those laws and if you don't carry a gun At the wall, you know, it's a shame.

727
00:49:19,028 --> 00:49:23,027
Rym: if you get killed and your stuff gets stolen and the sheriff will say up That's a shame.

728
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:24,260
Rym: I wish I could have helped him.

729
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:26,273
Rym: I should have helped him, but I couldn't have.

730
00:49:26,394 --> 00:49:31,640
Rym: I wanted to help him But at the same time you can't rely on the sheriff because there's only one sheriff and he's busy.

731
00:49:32,164 --> 00:49:33,799
Scott: So and the deputies are corrupt.

732
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,365
Rym: You've got to carry a gun.

733
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:39,780
Rym: if you're on the internet, you've got to have at least a little bit of internet gun.

734
00:49:39,942 --> 00:49:41,100
Scott: Well, I think that's the thing.

735

738
00:49:51,632 --> 00:49:52,816

739
00:49:53,117 --> 00:49:53,820

Scott: you always thought that they were gonna be rustled any Minute.

744
00:49:59,741 --> 00:50:03,115
Scott: now the internet looks perfectly safe.

745
00:50:03,175 --> 00:50:04,320

746
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,066

747
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:07,912
Scott: no, you know, you could have.

748
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:10,120
Scott: you could be having your cattle rustled right now.

749
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:12,409
Scott: You wouldn't even know you had cattle Russell.

750
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:13,172
Scott: You wouldn't even know.

751

Scott: everything is invisible to the average person.

755
00:50:19,996 --> 00:50:21,200

Scott: on the one hand if we start Getting people to think the internet is dangerous as they should right They will start to fear it much like people fear guns today, you know Even though I guess guns should be you know.

759
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:49,180
Scott: But instead what we need to do is not fear the guns but instead have a proper level of respect for them.

760
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,199
Rym: Well that I think this her would be a healthy fear.

761
00:50:51,602 --> 00:50:54,275
