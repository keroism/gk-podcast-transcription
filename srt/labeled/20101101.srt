1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,418
Rym: Hey, it's Monday, November 1st, 2010.

2
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:11,999
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,924
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:18,230
Rym: tonight with resident GeekNights scientist Peter Olson We discuss science education.

5
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:22,887
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,518
Rym: You know, it's kind of scary that five years and one day ago.

7
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:32,540
Rym: We started GeekNights for no head.

8
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,252
Scott: We started it five years in like couple weeks ago.

9
00:00:35,393 --> 00:00:40,299
Rym: Well five years and one day ago We published GeekNights to people other than our friends.

10
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:44,215
Rym: Yeah, and we did it for like three weeks before that when we used to sing the opener.

11
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:45,299
Rym: remember that.

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,076
Rym: That's these stupid human tricks, so I'm pretty sure that those episodes are still up.

13
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:54,400
Scott: they are in the place.

14
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:57,269
Scott: I have guaranteed that they are publicly available.

15
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,757
Scott: So nobody can tell me that they are not publicly available.

16
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:00,018
Rym: Yep.

17
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:00,560
Rym: They're out there.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,150
Scott: They were linked and the only reason that I do not just straight-up link to them is Because I kind of like having secrets.

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,240
Scott: It's like in the old NES days, you know Finding secrets is like oh man.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,940
Rym: But let me tell you finding the original like beta of GeekNights is a lot like finding the pay-me-for-the-door charge.

21
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:19,939
Rym: You're never gonna get those hours back.

22
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:23,193
Rym: No We had a microphone on the other side of the room.

23
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:31,320
Rym: that Logitech stick mic Pointed straight up and we sat like 10 feet away from it hoping that the room would act as a sort of cheap compressor.

24
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:42,170
Scott: But as anyone out there who's got like old arts or old things that they've made that they're ashamed of Luke crane You should put them out there anyway, you know.

25
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:44,680
Scott: fact, I'm looking to say look at penny arcade, right?

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,920
Scott: You don't see them taking down those original strips.

27
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,333
Scott: In fact, they published a book of those old original strips.

28
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:52,000
Rym: Emily and I are actually gonna try it.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,623
Rym: I gotta find them.

30
00:01:52,643 --> 00:01:55,757
Rym: we're gonna try to trade all the essays we wrote in like high school.

31
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:58,309
Scott: Oh I don't think I have mine.

32
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:00,320
Scott: Yeah, otherwise I would do that.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,260
Rym: I think I got a bunch of hard drives and one of them is crash.

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:13,519
Scott: Maybe we can do is we can just put a Kickstarter and be like look everyone send in So your essays from high school and we'll make a website that people can take those essays and republish them and get a's.

35
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:14,424
Scott: No, no.

36
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:17,119
Scott: No, we'll just print out a book, you know, make a book.

37
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,383
Scott: We'll make a book but like a hundred high school essays will call it if it sells We'll make volume two.

38
00:02:21,745 --> 00:02:25,860
Rym: we can call the book terribly inaccurate representations of literature and history.

39
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:31,778
Scott: We give you like five fag all five paragraphs the book five paragraphs.

40
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:34,950
Rym: Actually kind of a good idea.

41
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,918
Rym: I would read that.

42
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:38,723
Scott: So I go read.

43
00:02:38,944 --> 00:02:40,308
Rym: everyone is so boring.

44
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:44,540
Rym: everyone's gonna start with the global statement and then zero in on their thesis statement.

45
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:45,700
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

46
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:51,990
Rym: So woman, uh Scott warm today.

47
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:57,440
Rym: No My apartment but my heat was working only in the bedroom not in the studio.

48
00:02:57,704 --> 00:03:01,651
Rym: It is warm in this apartment But my heat was not working in the studio the gig night studio.

49
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:05,209
Rym: nor was it working in the living room or the kitchen But it was working in the bedroom.

50
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,120
Rym: So I tell the building they're like, okay, we'll fix it.

51
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:10,119
Rym: Apparently by fix it they might well fix it.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,154
Rym: We'll turn it all the way up and we'll leave it on all.

53
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:12,940
Rym: goddamn day.

54
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:16,840
Rym: I got home and it was like 90 degrees is why you just don't ask for anything.

55
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:20,571
Rym: I wouldn't have had heat in the studio and it's gonna get cold.

56
00:03:20,632 --> 00:03:20,893
Rym: It's gonna.

57
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:21,856
Scott: it's already cold.

58
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:22,820
Scott: It's cold today woman.

59
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:25,919
Rym: I about froze my motherfucking nuts off.

60
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:29,854
Rym: My love for you at deathless is cold outside you by change that only like.

61
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:35,157
Scott: I was like trying to decide like You know how much coat I should wear this morning and I took not enough.

62
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:41,440
Rym: see NASA definitely needs to change its focus, but NASA was right on topic.

63
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:45,425
Rym: That was actually a long time ago.

64
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:46,811
Rym: we talked about that on GeekNights here.

65
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:47,473
Rym: Oh, yeah.

66
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:49,240
Rym: Yeah, so it is Monday.

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,725
Rym: It's a sign.

68
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:50,979
Rym: stay before we get to our guest.

69
00:03:51,495 --> 00:04:01,860
Rym: Yeah You said you had some news and you didn't want to talk about the holographic universe theory because you much like me Probably have at best a superficial understanding and did not want to be caught generalizing incorrectly.

70
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,411
Scott: Yeah, so I really don't know much about it at all.

71
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:19,099
Rym: I'm excited about it and I explained it to a bunch of people not on the air poor because I Can explain it poorly but well enough to where it gets the point across but without having a record where someone can prove me wrong in subtle and pedantic ways.

72
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:31,361
Rym: Anyway, all I'm gonna say is I think it's really cool and I'm kind of excited about the fact that we're getting to the point in the world where we can test for the reliability of things like causality or Locality.

73
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:33,870
Rym: and you know science always has the boring answer like.

74
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,766
Scott: it's mostly because we invented cool things like lasers that help you do It.

75
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:44,767
Rym: yeah But it's always like if there's a cool option and a boring option science usually finds the boring option Like are there aliens now now?

76
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:49,279
Rym: water on that now now now now now is the world just a hologram on a turtle.

77
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:55,377
Rym: now Now but someday we're gonna find something where they're gonna be like, yeah, you know what we disprove causality.

78
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:56,440
Rym: Check it out.

79
00:04:57,842 --> 00:04:59,655
Rym: That electron went back in time and killed your mom.

80
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:00,320
Rym: now what?

81
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:06,499
Scott: So check that here's some news that might actually affect your life in a meaningful way, right?

82
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,700
Rym: I have a feeling that the breakdown of causality would affect my life in a meaningful way if they broke it down.

83
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,846
Scott: But I'm just saying if they just disproved it It wouldn't be that information wouldn't change.

84
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:19,416
Rym: disproving of causality would open up the possibility of free will.

85
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:22,105
Rym: actually anyway That would be exciting.

86
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:24,553
Scott: It wouldn't be the unit.

87
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,480
Scott: So society would not change as a result?

88
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:27,648
Rym: No, but I might change.

89
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:36,976
Scott: I might go all dunyane anyway anyway, so Apparently Google is suing the government which you can only do with the government's permission.

90
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:40,011
Rym: if I recall correctly I don't know if the government consented to the suit yet.

91
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:41,116
Scott: Yeah, I don't know either.

92
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:41,800
Scott: I don't know how that works.

93
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,364
Rym: Neither do I.

94
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:50,960
Scott: what I do know is that they are suing Because what happened was there was a bid, you know how they do bids for government contracts, right?

95
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,639
Scott: It's like oh the government wants to build a bridge.

96
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,445
Rym: Well, we gotta go with the lowest bidder.

97
00:05:55,546 --> 00:06:04,197
Scott: ten different bridge building companies say I will build the bridge for X dollars And now another company says I will build the bridge for X minus ten dollars.

98
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:20,260
Rym: Never mind we did an art we did a show we talked about this a long time ago where there's a Problem where there's a whole kind of line of business where you're not good at what you do But what you're good at is navigating the American bureaucracy and restaurants that are like that are like inside of airports.

99
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:26,719
Rym: Their primary business is filling out paperwork and handling the bureaucracy not making food as you can probably tell.

100
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:39,890
Scott: Yeah anyway, anyway, so So Google put in a bids to get the some part of the government the Department of the Interior to use Google Apps Instead of Microsoft Office or any you know, whatever else could be used right?

101
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:45,488
Scott: So they put in this bid and they got rejected boom crack-a-lack.

102
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:48,159
Scott: and they got rejected again double crack-a-lack.

103
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:55,773
Scott: and Basically the requirements for this contract were Let me see if the exact words are here somewhere.

104
00:06:55,793 --> 00:07:00,792
Scott: Yeah, I can't find them right now But basically the contract requirements were.

105
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:02,940
Scott: it has to be Microsoft compatible.

106
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:11,429
Scott: So basically that's like if I put it a bit and I said our town needs ten cars For compatible they need to be Ford's now.

107
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,877
Scott: Here's manufacturers send in a bid please.

108
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:14,880
Rym: Here's what I would argue.

109
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:16,955
Rym: They didn't say Ford's.

110
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:18,460
Rym: they said Ford compatible.

111
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:22,226
Rym: I would put forth my Chevy and be like It'll drive on the same road.

112
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:25,280
Rym: afford will drive on because open office will drive on the same road.

113
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,627
Rym: The world will drive on kind of almost.

114
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:35,531
Scott: the point is that basically the government sort of was hindering Competition here and sort of giving bullshit.

115
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:39,516
Rym: Here's the question corrupt bidding system was it or incompetence?

116
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:42,209
Guest: because Doesn't matter I know it doesn't matter.

117
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:51,715
Rym: but I still want to know because if it's corruption I expect that and if it's incompetence, it makes me sad, but I Should be angry or sad.

118
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:55,519
Rym: I Want to know if I should be angry or sad.

119
00:07:56,482 --> 00:08:06,309
Scott: See, I find it strange that you would be angry or sad because like if it's in confidence, I expect that and if it's It's Corruption I expect.

120
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,380
Scott: so it's the same feeling either way.

121
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,485
Rym: Yeah, I guess I get angry when someone like when a fat guy blocks me from the subway I get angry because he screwed me up.

122
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:19,355
Rym: But if a fat guy just is fat, I'm sad because he's fat.

123
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,827
Rym: I Don't know if the government is fat.

124
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:26,399
Rym: I'm just sad but if it's also in my way, I'm also angry.

125
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:30,034
Scott: Thing is whether it's sad or in your way.

126
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:31,060
Scott: You should push it over.

127
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:33,207
Scott: It doesn't matter Scott.

128
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:34,852
Rym: if I push it over I might kill someone.

129
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:36,376
Scott: well Google's trying to push it over.

130
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:37,400
Scott: they might kill Microsoft.

131
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:40,919
Rym: The thing is Microsoft has been doing fine lately.

132
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:48,580
Scott: I'm using Windows on my desktop because it's better more bad press about Microsoft and like ever before I know people are looking down on them more than ever before.

133
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,569
Rym: It's unjustified like I agree.

134
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:51,593
Scott: Microsoft thing is.

135
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:53,040
Scott: you make a fuck ton of money.

136
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,960
Scott: They do not from big business contracts.

137
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,406
Scott: They do government being one of them.

138
00:08:56,486 --> 00:09:02,588
Scott: and if Google can force Microsoft out of the government contract arena That's gonna hurt Microsoft a lot.

139
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:04,715
Scott: We're like millions millions and millions of dollars.

140
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:08,919
Rym: another way to go about hurting now This is this is crazy leftist whack job.

141
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:13,499
Rym: What if Microsoft because up Microsoft really is a business probably needs to move into?

142
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:23,640
Rym: tablets and mobile stuff and all this kind of modern thing because core OS is No longer, I think a viable business except for proprietary applications.

143
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:28,600
Scott: But I made it a commodity the brow, you know exactly and then browsers themselves a commodity.

144
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:30,450
Rym: I feel like operating systems.

145
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:30,952
Rym: at least.

146
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:37,900
Rym: there should be a Government branch of Linux that or at least the government should fund open source development in some way and independently.

147
00:09:38,522 --> 00:09:47,619
Rym: Wouldn't it be cool if just the operating system wing of Microsoft and maybe the document stuff too Was bought by the government maintained by the government and just was free?

148
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:53,560
Scott: That's dangerous for the rest of the world to be incredibly scared and they would not like that at all.

149
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,717
Rym: It's dangerous primarily because how many patches would come out after ten years of government control?

150
00:09:58,837 --> 00:09:59,800
Scott: think about this way, right?

151
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,560
Scott: Okay, so the government the US government might think that's a great idea.

152
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:07,875
Scott: But imagine if the the Russian government bought the Microsoft Windows.

153
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:12,740
Scott: very bad news Yeah, so any government buying something like that is very bad.

154
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:14,085
Rym: Here's what those governments will do.

155
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:17,640
Rym: they'll hem and haw and then like China remember the dragon processor.

156
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,895
Rym: They're like, yeah Western x86 wick our own processor.

157
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,060
Scott: All right, they could probably do it.

158
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:27,039
Rym: We have reverse-engineered the 486. we will compete with your penny in billions.

159
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,780
Scott: You're right If you can make a web browser that plays video.

160
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,980
Scott: Video is really the limiter because if you just want to show images and stuff 46 can do pretty well.

161
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,328
Rym: That's actually a fairly lucrative lucrative business.

162
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:44,920
Rym: a lot of technology a lot of hardware that the military and the government use Have mandates that say they have to be manufactured on US soil by US companies.

163
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:51,880
Rym: There's a fairly lucrative lucrative business in old technology fabs to make old shit for the government.

164
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:53,306
Scott: Yeah, but you cut.

165
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:56,960
Scott: the amount of money it costs to create such a business is incredibly high.

166
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:05,800
Rym: but at the same time if you already have an old fab rather than tearing it down you just Contract to the government and overcharge them times a billion because I think only game in town funny people are doing that already.

167
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:07,820
Scott: Yeah, you can't break into that business.

168
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,879
Rym: Yeah, at best you can work for a company that does that like I once did anyway actually twice did.

169
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,837
Scott: But anyway, the point is this is pretty exciting because hopefully we can get some more government technology improvements.

170
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:19,640
Scott: However slow.

171
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:33,000
Rym: I think it's part of a bigger trend where for a long time I'd say for like the past four or five years up until just recently We were kind of at a plateau in a lot of kind of our nerdy computer technological stuff.

172
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:55,080
Rym: like there weren't a lot of revolutions happening and suddenly there has been this spate of lawsuit related chaos where for a long time like the patent stuff where there's a million companies all poised to sue the hell out of Each other and then recently they all just hit nuke and they all sued each other And now Google's suing and all these lawsuits are gonna end at some point and unlike the SEO lawsuit things are gonna change.

173
00:11:55,422 --> 00:12:00,799
Scott: I think what it is is that for a longest time there they were advancing rapidly So they kept coming out with new things.

174
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:04,736
Scott: So everyone is getting new patents and new patents and making new stuff and making more money.

175
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:09,520
Scott: and now You know, it's like what has there really been new recently?

176
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,128
Scott: Well, it gets to the point where have been crooks slightly So's like our CPUs now have more than one core.

177
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:23,580
Rym: gets to the point where it is cheaper to hire the lawyers to engage in The mutually assured destruction crazy lawsuit than it is to pay an R&D team to come up with something.

178
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:25,828
Scott: What are the new things that are happening?

179
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:26,952
Scott: We made a social website.

180
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:28,980
Scott: We made a slightly different social website.

181
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:34,140
Scott: You know, it's like nobody's really making it But you talk about they're only making things that are crooks slightly.

182
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:36,960
Rym: So you push it in the same direction that we go with video games a lot.

183
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,464
Rym: I know a lot of you.

184
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:39,439
Rym: Monday listeners don't bother with the Tuesday night shows.

185
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:45,293
Rym: a Big problem in the video game industry Is that everyone thinks I want to make a massively multiplayer role-playing game.

186
00:12:45,574 --> 00:12:47,260
Rym: World of Warcraft is the biggest and best.

187
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:53,459
Rym: I'm going to try to compete with them and do the exact same thing They do and I'll be 1% better and no one's gonna give a shit.

188
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:57,235
Rym: No and technology a lot of times is the same thing.

189
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,942
Scott: Everything is the same thing Almost everything.

190
00:13:00,223 --> 00:13:05,980
Scott: Yeah, I mean the one thing is that with a traditional sort of business like say a plumber or a carpenter, right?

191
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,480
Scott: It's like you didn't even have to be better than the other carpenter.

192
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:10,868
Scott: It doesn't be better than the other carpenter in town.

193
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:18,091
Scott: But when you're in the whole world when you're an international digital business Location don't mean shit except for your taxes, right?

194
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,055
Scott: You just have to be better.

195
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:20,440
Rym: Don't get me started on taxes.

196
00:13:21,605 --> 00:13:22,800
Scott: It doesn't matter where you are.

197
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,713
Scott: Like if I open up a dry cleaner, I could be a shitty ass dry cleaner But I can open up in a town with no dry cleaners.

198
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:28,235
Scott: Boom.

199
00:13:28,316 --> 00:13:29,140
Scott: I'm in business, baby.

200
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:31,190
Rym: I just pictured a dry cleaner who signed.

201
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,220
Rym: they were called shitty ass dry cleaners.

202
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:38,559
Scott: I would go to that dry cleaner, even if they charge twice as much just because they're awesome.

203
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,364
Scott: name Like what I would.

204
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:41,951
Scott: here's how you get the marketing right.

205
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,060
Scott: is you would take like a piece of cardboard that looks like a poop.

206
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:47,720
Scott: I'd be like your business card and you'd put it in the plastic with the clothing.

207
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:54,479
Scott: It's like you would pick up your shirts and they'd be wrapped in plastic and then under the plastic It would look like there was a piece of cardboard poop like on that.

208
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,575
Rym: So actually this was many months ago when we first moved to the city.

209
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:58,540
Rym: me and Emily are out somewhere.

210
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,736
Rym: We saw a local billboard like what are those lowdown billboards out in?

211
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:02,560
Rym: like the Bronx somewhere?

212
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:08,480
Rym: And it was ass man proctologist and it looked legit and it said butts are our business.

213
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:10,266
Scott: That's what that is.

214
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:17,440
Rym: So I know Facebook isn't something we often talk about.

215
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:22,436
Rym: I mean I don't even have a Facebook account not because I'm a curmudgeon because I graduated before.

216
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:26,189
Rym: Facebook was available To people who weren't in college.

217
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,780
Scott: just go get you should just get one and then don't use it.

218
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:30,880
Rym: Yeah, but I don't want it there festering.

219
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,340
Rym: I don't want to make sites that are related to me that don't have anything about me on.

220
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,558
Scott: Well, what you could do is you could forward your tweets to it.

221
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:39,275
Rym: Yeah, but that because I do.

222
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:39,920
Scott: I don't go to face.

223
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,946
Scott: but then what's gonna happen?

224
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:45,773
Rym: is someone's gonna friend me like I'm a Family member and then they're gonna ask me why they didn't friendly.

225
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,080
Rym: It's gonna be that South Park episode.

226
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:48,965
Scott: You just ignore them.

227
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:50,652
Scott: Just don't don't click on it.

228
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:52,440
Rym: Yeah, and that didn't work so well in South Park.

229
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:53,544
Rym: It's sound clearly.

230
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,712
Rym: South Park is a perfect analog of the real world.

231
00:14:56,475 --> 00:15:02,924
Rym: But anyway, I Think Slashdot is getting Surprisingly conservative.

232
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:06,014
Rym: and I think this is happening because you're reading too much.

233
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:07,038
Scott: Slashdot is dead.

234
00:15:07,138 --> 00:15:07,760
Scott: Stop reading it.

235
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,644
Rym: No, it's not eggs.

236
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:08,965
Scott: Also.

237
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:10,311
Scott: That's not read that either dig.

238
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:12,180
Rym: I wouldn't say dig is dead.

239
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,325
Rym: I would say it's pretty dead.

240
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:16,238
Rym: dig was never quite came to be.

241
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:32,420
Rym: dig was like it was this little thing and it exploded so fast that like in a in a Not used by anybody enough to matter to used by everybody and therefore meaningless.

242
00:15:33,286 --> 00:15:35,219
Rym: There was basically no period at which it was useful.

243
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:42,459
Rym: but my trouble is that it's weird that lately I've been reading slashdot comments and I felt that they've been getting more and more conservative.

244
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:53,780
Rym: slashdot was pretty against the dude who was scanning the barcodes and the selling books and making a profit from used bookstores and They were really mad about my comments in this Facebook article.

245
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:02,880
Rym: But basically the Facebook article was just about the new feature the stalker tool that lets you Easily see the conversations that happened that were public between two of your friends.

246
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:07,300
Rym: So say you and Scott Johnson were using Facebook and like talking to each other.

247
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:12,200
Rym: I could say show me what Scott and Scott talked about and it would just tell me because I could see all that stuff.

248
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:20,479
Rym: Anyway, it just takes extent information that is publicly available That both of you consented to make available in Facebook and gives it to me in an aggregated form that I can then read.

249
00:16:21,202 --> 00:16:24,560
Rym: People are losing their goddamn shit over this as is expected.

250
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:39,980
Rym: uh-huh, and I I feel like the core problem because with this whole privacy debate comes down to the fact that people in America have unreasonable expectations of privacy and They have unreasonable expectations about the transitive nature of privacy.

251
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:46,588
Rym: in fact, one person tried to argue that transitive privacy is not the way to go and Transitive privacy is the only privacy you have.

252
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,814
Rym: anything I ever say.

253
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:54,500
Rym: if any human being ever hears it I have to implicitly trust them to use that information in a way that I approve or I'm fucked and you know.

254
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,204
Scott: Well, you can leave.

255
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:59,460
Scott: you can also legally obligate them to keep a secret Ah, but if you don't know it depends though.

256
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,222
Rym: If I tell you something and then I want to make you do a contract after I told you No,

257
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:05,161
Scott: you have to do the contract before you tell them Yeah,

258
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:08,935
Rym: and even then one-sided contracts aren't really enforceable in court and there's a yeah,

259
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:09,980
Scott: they have to sign the contract.

260
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:12,188
Rym: I guess I don't know.

261
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:15,020
Rym: I feel like this is an issue where there can't be any argument.

262
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:25,480
Rym: In fact, I don't want it one step further in this whole privacy brouhaha That's brewing now on the tech world to the point that even non Texas started like even Jon Stewart's making jokes about Facebook.

263
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:30,080
Rym: Normal people are starting to like get the fact that Facebook invades their privacy.

264
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:38,616
Rym: but I would argue that all of the arguments on either side of the privacy issue are completely moot and pointless except for the one that I mean.

265
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:43,775
Rym: because Alright, even if the people who say we don't have any privacy agreed.

266
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:47,496
Rym: Yes, we should have privacy It's impossible to have yep.

267
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:53,860
Rym: So Even if I agree with you a hundred percent, there is no way to redress your grievances at all.

268
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:55,499
Rym: It is absolutely impossible.

269
00:17:55,861 --> 00:18:04,794
Scott: It is as impossible to give you privacy on the internet as much as it is impossible to stop Piracy piracy and privacy both equally unstoppable.

270
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:08,860
Scott: In fact, they are the same thing They are the transfer and dissemination of information.

271
00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:10,247
Scott: You cannot stop it.

272
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:20,340
Scott: if you may share if there is something in your brain At least as of now you can keep it a secret but soon Soon, we'll have mind reading devices and know that is not a joke, right?

273
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:30,912
Scott: Until then though if you think it it's a secret But if you write it down if you tell it to someone and especially if you type it into the Internet's You have effectively shared it with the world.

274
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:32,220
Scott: That is how the world works.

275
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:36,020
Scott: You can't stop it unless you destroy all the computers with some sort of apocalypse.

276
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:37,972
Scott: So that's the way the world works.

277
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:38,556
Scott: get used to it.

278
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:39,260
Rym: Here's my point.

279
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,880
Scott: I wrote a blog post about this in like June of '09 and I haven't had to edit it or clarify it.

280
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,879
Scott: It is a word-for-word is exactly the same opinion.

281
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:55,999
Scott: I still have part of the problem still the perfect rebuttal to every single privacy article that comes up every week And this is my root point.

282
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:57,365
Rym: this is the news.

283
00:18:57,425 --> 00:19:04,159
Rym: people are freaking out about a feature that shows you information that you can already see and They don't give a shit about fire sheep.

284
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:05,648
Rym: Which fire sheep?

285
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:06,834
Scott: because I can't see.

286
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:07,960
Scott: only nerds see that fire.

287
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:14,000
Rym: She does what any tech has been able to do for as long as there's been an internet.

288
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:15,090
Scott: Yeah, I mean since 1999, right?

289
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,661
Scott: There's there's this piece of software called ethereal which is later renamed to wire shark Right.

290
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:21,664
Scott: and what this does?

291
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:26,920
Scott: it puts your network card be it wireless or wired into what is known as promiscuous mode.

292
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:36,500
Scott: And if you know anything about how Ethernet or wireless works, basically when you send packets from your you know Network card and your computer those packets go to every computer on the entire local network.

293
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:40,907
Scott: The thing is is they're using these Mac addresses So basically the network card.

294
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:43,140
Scott: if me and remember the same well, you're you're right.

295
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,893
Rym: But I want to jump in because modern networks are actually a bit different from.

296
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:46,335
Scott: are they any?

297
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:48,242
Scott: with the point if it's switch It's a little different.

298
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:48,965
Rym: everything switch.

299
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:57,660
Scott: basically to keep it short if me and Ram are both browsing the web in the same Starbucks I'm actually seeing everything he's doing and he's seeing everything I'm doing the differences.

300
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,568
Scott: Our network cards are filtering out.

301
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:02,199
Scott: So we're only getting the packets meant for us like a little.

302
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:03,484
Scott: yeah You know internet sieve.

303
00:20:03,624 --> 00:20:07,600
Rym: now if you're not using SSL, you don't have the little HTTPS and the little shield.

304
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,379
Scott: HTTPS is a way to encrypt your internet your web connection, you know WWE, right?

305
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,319
Scott: Between your computer and the web server.

306
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:22,960
Scott: So if you visit say Amazon and you don't have HTTPS then people see everything you're doing.

307
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,358
Scott: But if you have the s there then everything between your computer and the Amazon computer is encrypted and nobody can bust that.

308
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:31,048
Scott: or it's Incredibly hard to bust that.

309
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:37,320
Scott: and if you they try to bust it There'll be all these alarms going off in your browser like red lights and pop-ups which people will ignore.

310
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:39,197
Scott: Anyway, I'll ignore but because they're stupid, right?

311
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:42,628
Rym: but I guess the part of the thing is that one.

312
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,658
Rym: this actually wasn't a concern for a while before.

313
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:54,659
Rym: there were ubiquitous hot spots and a lot of people who weren't text had laptops and we're connecting them to wireless networks that other people We're also connected to that weren't for work.

314
00:20:55,362 --> 00:21:01,220
Rym: This hadn't been an issue because we had transitioned from flat land structures to switch infrastructure where no one can see anyone else's packets.

315
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:09,824
Rym: Yeah short of like an RIT short of attacks like I could attack old Cisco routers and get it to show me everyone's packets by flooding them and Override.

316
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:16,116
Rym: basically that is actually an attack though Yeah They'd get so flooded that they would start broadcasting everything and then I just sniff like an RIT.

317
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:19,050
Scott: if I turned on Wireshark or ethereal you wouldn't see shit.

318
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:20,799
Scott: I would see Rym stuff because you had a hub.

319
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:26,331
Scott: Yeah, because we couldn't afford a switch back then I wouldn't see anyone else's shit in the whole apartment building.

320
00:21:26,391 --> 00:21:26,712
Scott: right.

321
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:32,280
Scott: but nowadays, you know If you turn on Iran, you won't see anyone who's doing anything outside of your house.

322
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:37,106
Scott: And you know if you have a router routers or switches, they're not hubs So you're not even gonna see the other people in your house.

323
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:39,775
Scott: Well, unless using wireless routers are bridges.

324
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:40,578
Rym: They're they're.

325
00:21:40,658 --> 00:21:41,280
Rym: they're routers.

326
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,630
Scott: Household routers are usually like four ports.

327
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,337
Rym: Oh, yeah, they'll switch but they're also around.

328
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:46,182
Scott: there's switch They're.

329
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:48,040
Scott: you're not gonna see anything unless you're everyone's using.

330
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:55,504
Scott: Even if you're using wireless if one person's on the two point whatever gigahertz and one person's on the other gigahertz You still won't see anything.

331
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,207
Rym: that's decide.

332
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:59,500
Rym: but so people are freaking out about fire sheep at least tech people.

333
00:22:00,003 --> 00:22:08,440
Rym: But the tech people should realize that back when I had a cable modem I could see all the traffic of everyone in my neighborhood.

334
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:22,340
Scott: Yeah, I mean basically all this fire sheep is is it's taking a piece of software a capability of you know Networks that has existed since the 90s and are even older than that and they just put a good user interface on it.

335
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:34,880
Scott: It's it's basically an old incredibly easy and trivial hack that was as always existed and has always been obvious But they have made it, you know Noticed by the common person who doesn't understand network.

336
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,600
Rym: I think where we're going to see it easy is a new era of script kiddieism.

337
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,740
Rym: But it's almost worse and I'm glad it's happening because we've gone through eras.

338
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:52,480
Rym: There was an era where the internet was the wild goddamn West where I would put viruses on floppy disks gives them to my friends Then hack into their computers from home and steal all their stuff.

339
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,014
Scott: Yeah And that was you can like format their hard drives and all sorts of nasty shit.

340
00:22:57,034 --> 00:23:04,900
Rym: what I would always do shit that I wish People would do these day What I'd always do is we'd be playing command and conquer and I'd open their CD tray to distract them and then I'd attack them.

341
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:06,746
Rym: Yeah with back orifice.

342
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:09,335
Rym: Yeah, and I forget with the one with the.

343
00:23:09,677 --> 00:23:12,491
Rym: I forget what it was called now But it was the one where it had like that torch icon.

344
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,155
Scott: I don't know.

345
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:19,019
Rym: anyway there I it was really easy to hack and it was just a wild west and whoever was smarter would just win on the internet.

346
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:26,700
Rym: and Then we moved on to where professionals started writing viruses which meant it's all spam and it's all being used to make money.

347
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:37,860
Scott: I wish that they would make viruses that erase people's hard drives because then people would actually give a shit instead of Breaking just being like oh I have a hundred viruses and I don't even know or care because they're sending spam and they're invisible.

348
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:45,059
Rym: So we went from a world where people were making merry mischief with the internet to a world where evil professionals are doing evil for profit.

349
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:48,809
Rym: and Now we're moving to a world where it's not even script kiddies.

350
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:50,153
Rym: It's browser kiddies.

351
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:57,820
Scott: It's a fire Fox plug-in That's freely available and has an easy user interface on it with icons and pictures.

352
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,980
Rym: People were demanding that Mozilla somehow block it and Mozilla was like are you kidding?

353
00:24:03,203 --> 00:24:03,446
Rym: Someone?

354
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:04,660
Rym: on slash I made the best point.

355
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:08,634
Rym: They said never underestimate the power of scotch tape and a grudge.

356
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:11,965
Rym: if someone wants something hard enough There is nothing you can do to stop them.

357
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:14,874
Rym: Yeah, you can't accept fucking encryption.

358
00:24:15,095 --> 00:24:18,528
Scott: You're not no one's gonna be able to Do anything to you fucking encryption?

359
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:19,110
Rym: How does it work?

360
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,492
Rym: No one?

361
00:24:19,713 --> 00:24:21,299
Rym: No, I mean are we alright?

362
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,125
Rym: So say we want to put up SSL.

363
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:27,480
Rym: half our listeners aren't gonna understand that and they'll see the warning about the self-signed certificate.

364
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,022
Rym: I don't know.

365
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:29,489
Scott: I'll just disable HTTP.

366
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,614
Scott: It'll be HTTPS only.

367
00:24:30,674 --> 00:24:31,840
Rym: Yeah, but do you want to pay?

368
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,450
Rym: Someone for a so-called legit certificate.

369
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,177
Scott: I can get a legit certificate from Gandhi.

370
00:24:36,197 --> 00:24:37,040
Scott: Yeah, pretty cheap actually.

371
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:38,257
Rym: Yeah, we could get one but it cost money.

372
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:43,880
Scott: Yeah, it does cost money does cost money as you know, but it depends also what kind of you know.

373
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,409
Scott: That's because SSL is a scam.

374
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,180
Scott: There's a racket, but I don't want to get into that.

375
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,133
Rym: Yeah, I'll put it this way all the fears of it's weird.

376
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:55,881
Rym: People are most afraid of People who are taking extent information and showing it to you information you are.

377
00:24:55,901 --> 00:25:04,480
Rym: it's like if someone went into your house found your bank account and then told you all With all the information that was in your bank account and didn't even keep it for themselves.

378
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,798
Rym: They're just like hey, here's all this information that you already have.

379
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:07,441
Scott: yeah,

380
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:24,610
Rym: but they're not afraid of the fact that I can just go into a Starbucks and steal a hundred myspace accounts and Facebook accounts and RIT Accounts and email accounts and FRC forum accounts and there's nothing you can do about it except never logging into anything That isn't encrypted on any public wireless ever.

381
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:27,020
Scott: Oh, there is one thing you can do VPNs.

382
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,500
Scott: No, people are actually saying there was a suggestion that people do SSH tunnel, right?

383
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,440
Scott: So I could set up an SSH tunnel for example from Mike and my laptop to say my line Yeah, that's just a poor man's VPN.

384
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,225
Scott: Well, no the problem with that right?

385
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:40,646
Scott: is the?

386
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:49,996
Scott: the reason that you a VPN or an SSH tunnel is not gonna cut it Theoretically at least right is let's say I make the SSH tunnel to my line node where they were.

387
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:50,920
Scott: the website is hosted.

388
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:52,178
Scott: That would totally work, right?

389
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,880
Scott: No one in the Starbucks would be able to see shit But someone who's on the other side of the line node could see everything anyway.

390
00:25:58,021 --> 00:25:59,569
Scott: But SSL is the only thing.

391
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:12,840
Rym: I got you from both ends But there are few people remember and that's I'm visiting my own website Which I have both ends after you get past the local network the no one but a professional is going to get your unencrypted data.

392
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,267
Scott: There still could be evil professionals.

393
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:15,754
Rym: Yeah, but they're a minority.

394
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:16,840
Rym: I mean, here's the problem.

395
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:20,939
Rym: The problem is people stealing like my Facebook account and causing trouble for me.

396
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:25,180
Rym: No one like most ad is not gonna go after me out there me massage.

397
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,340
Rym: Yeah, what's gonna go after me is the dude in the Starbucks who wants to post cockboats on my wall.

398
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,760
Scott: That's true, but there could be and I suspect at least one at one or two places in the world.

399
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,023
Scott: This is happening If not more.

400
00:26:35,063 --> 00:26:36,349
Scott: I'd be very surprised where.

401
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:50,220
Scott: there's some guy at an ISP somewhere Who's got like a computer set up like one you in Iraq somewhere and he was just like Foraging tons and tons of accounts into like big bundles and then selling them for like the height to the highest bidder in China.

402
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,294
Rym: Pretty trivial to do absolutely trivial to do.

403
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:54,500
Scott: you go completely undetected.

404
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:57,800
Scott: No one would know that there was like an extra computer in Iraq with an extra wire.

405
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,507
Scott: They wouldn't know that it'd be completely hidden.

406
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,174
Scott: You could put it in a closet somewhere.

407
00:27:01,195 --> 00:27:02,400
Scott: totally get away with it.

408
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:12,739
Scott: So you're basically trusting everyone at every ISP everywhere not to be that guy Unless you actually get your encryption going all the way to the other end instead of just part of the way.

409
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:23,497
Rym: So things of the day.

410
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,480
Rym: What do you got for me Scott?

411
00:27:24,982 --> 00:27:36,648
Scott: Oh, man, if you have never seen Right, like the awesomest model trains in the world You don't need to see them because here is something that is similar but superior in the eyes of Scott this guy.

412
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:38,320
Scott: now What some Lionel?

413
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,450
Rym: no Lionel?

414
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:55,115
Scott: No, this guy in his you know equivalent of model train room has made not a set of model trains but instead of slot cars, however, this set of slot cars is basically a Perfect Formula One track.

415
00:27:55,456 --> 00:28:00,470
Scott: a lot of people with pit crew and such and such and grandstands and everything.

416
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:09,170
Scott: A lot of people are really down on slot cars because even though even the lighting It's like it looks like a racetrack that is lit up at night for a night race.

417
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:15,007
Rym: It's pretty hot but a lot of people don't Respect slot cars enough because they look at it and they think I don't have to steer.

418
00:28:15,268 --> 00:28:15,730
Rym: that's stupid.

419
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,934
Rym: I'll just hold it down the whole time.

420
00:28:16,954 --> 00:28:17,637
Rym: They don't realize.

421
00:28:17,657 --> 00:28:18,440
Scott: fly off the track.

422
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,728
Rym: Yeah, it's all about speed control much like real racing.

423
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:27,390
Rym: Yeah, it's actually a better analog for non race car drivers of race car driving than an actual driving simulator.

424
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:37,110
Scott: Yeah, I mean basically, you know, if you just hold down the trigger all the way you'd be like Oh whoever has the better slot car will win except on little kid tracks where you can hold it down the whole time exactly.

425
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:41,040
Scott: but basically when you get to the you know When you get to a turn you have to let go.

426
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,817
Scott: but if you let go all the way the car will just stop And you'll get past.

427
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:50,190
Scott: but and you also if you know and also there'll be other situations Like you'd be coming to a part where the tracks cross.

428
00:28:50,692 --> 00:28:51,697
Scott: So it's like well, what do you do?

429
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:54,370
Scott: Do you slow down and let the other guy cross over first?

430
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,417
Scott: Do you try to beat him if you crash?

431
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,962
Scott: you crashed.

432
00:28:58,062 --> 00:29:00,090
Scott: if you're actually taking it seriously, right?

433
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:06,010
Rym: So there was that big slot car track system in beacon that we are like on the border from beacon and fish kill.

434
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:06,753
Rym: We never went to.

435
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:08,540
Scott: yeah was attached to that shady bowling alley.

436
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,110
Rym: Yeah, I feel like we should have gone there at least once.

437
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,156
Rym: Yeah, we talked about.

438
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:14,370
Scott: it was like a birthday party kind of place.

439
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:26,742
Scott: It was not like this which is like a man's You know, so this guy is obviously this is number one hobby and you look at this and he is definitely achieved greatness in his Hobby and for that he is a geek nice type of person.

440
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:28,910
Rym: So, you know, I'm all about the urban exploration.

441
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:34,695
Rym: I used to do it a lot more and we lived upstate because there was a lot of industrial ruins and I could get away With it around here.

442
00:29:34,715 --> 00:29:37,670
Rym: I feel like if I break into a band in factory, I'm gonna get shot.

443
00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:40,484
Scott: You don't go into a band in factory, but you want to do in New York City's.

444
00:29:40,504 --> 00:29:41,790
Scott: you want to go into underground things?

445
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,170
Rym: Like yeah the things that'll get me shot as a terrorist.

446
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:46,139
Scott: No, you got like hobo who lives under the street.

447
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,753
Scott: you go to in there's a hobo down there and it's like hey hobo What's going on?

448
00:29:49,773 --> 00:30:00,210
Rym: Nice sewage, but one thing I've always been fascinated with are empty tunnels, especially abandoned tunnels Like I was really, you know when we did that trip you didn't come but we went through the Rochester subway.

449
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:03,010
Rym: We walked the entire length of the Rochester subway system.

450
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:09,815
Scott: I mean, it's not a tunnel that gets me that I have any interest in but what I do have interest in is anything Where there used to be stuff.

451
00:30:10,156 --> 00:30:19,130
Rym: well civilized stuff and now one you would have liked not the Rochester subway Because in the Rochester subway among other things all the stations were still there.

452
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:22,102
Scott: Oh, the thing is that thing is as much as I like it.

453
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:27,400
Scott: It also makes me sad Yeah, and if I had like powers the saddest are.

454
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:32,617
Scott: basically what I would do with my powers is make things that are out of Use in use like the saddest part.

455
00:30:32,638 --> 00:30:36,848
Rym: There's like I go to Queens and I'm like world's fair exist again.

456
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:41,350
Rym: But there's this one spot that was really sad where it looked like the Mines of Moria.

457
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:49,670
Rym: There was these intricate art deco columns that were gigantic Spanning as far as the eye could see in every direction and it was just an empty abandoned place.

458
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,720
Rym: They're gonna fill in eventually because they want hobos to live there.

459
00:30:52,222 --> 00:30:53,870
Scott: Oh, I just let the hobos live there.

460
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,556
Rym: Why don't they turn into a tourist attraction?

461
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,001
Rym: What stuff down there?

462
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:59,670
Scott: They just turn at least turn it into a paintball airsoft arena.

463
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:06,890
Scott: Oh, man, that's what you should do with all large abandoned places is play airsoft until the black paintball laser tag.

464
00:31:07,251 --> 00:31:11,870
Rym: So a year later the police come see a firefight taking place and that's the end of you.

465
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:15,121
Scott: You set it up as a business with a storefront and everything.

466
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:16,907
Scott: So it's completely legitimate.

467
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:22,427
Rym: what I did not know I mean the table don't even know that there was a subway in Rochester, New York.

468
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:30,950
Rym: of all places But even fewer people know that there's a series of intricate tunnels connecting large portions of Salem, Oregon.

469
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:33,430
Scott: I've never even heard of Salem, Oregon.

470
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:37,925
Scott: I've heard of Salem New York and Salem Massachusetts and you've heard of Oregon I assume.

471
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:39,450
Rym: Yeah, not Oregon.

472
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:44,600
Rym: I also heard of Missouri But in Oregon, there's actually a hue in Salem at least.

473
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,462
Rym: there's this huge network of tunnels connecting Buildings all over the downtown.

474
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:50,790
Scott: and why was it made?

475
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:58,009
Rym: It was made for various reasons that evolved over time and different parts of it arose in different eras Like if you like there's some people who are exploring it.

476
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:00,535
Rym: Pretty big really.

477
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:04,270
Rym: It was a boomtown a long time ago a lot of Chinese immigrants and during prohibition.

478
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:13,558
Rym: but to quote this article there's an antique bank vault with an intact gold drop from the bank upstairs a 1920 stairwell that goes way up to nowhere.

479
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,102
Scott: a gold drop.

480
00:32:15,182 --> 00:32:17,730
Scott: you put gold in it and it falls into the vault.

481
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:20,250
Scott: Oh, no, no, but I mean gold is fucking heavy.

482
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,769
Scott: If you drop gold, it's gonna get first of all soft gonna get a big old dent in it.

483
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:26,310
Rym: Well, there was probably a dumbwaiter or something.

484
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:28,564
Scott: I mean, I'm not but then it's not a gold drop.

485
00:32:28,584 --> 00:32:29,610
Scott: then it's a gold lift.

486
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,962
Rym: It's a gold drop like a mail drop a mail drop.

487
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:34,708
Scott: Just drops the mail via gravity.

488
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:35,410
Rym: Not always.

489
00:32:35,491 --> 00:32:36,356
Rym: Sometimes it's just a hole.

490
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:38,410
Rym: you put the mail in someone's a male elevator goes.

491
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,429
Rym: Sometimes you just put it on anyway, there's a gold drop.

492
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,744
Rym: There's a 20s stairway that goes nowhere an entire 30s grocery store.

493
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,570
Rym: Where did the stairway originally go?

494
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,177
Rym: No one knows.

495
00:32:48,238 --> 00:32:48,769
Rym: some building.

496
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,195
Rym: Okay, kind of like how.

497
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:58,804
Rym: when they took down the book off in Midtown and when they took away all the like shelves There was this fancy old metal door connecting to the building next door.

498
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:04,481
Rym: That's just walled off on the other side on 80s disco and just stuff like that.

499
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:07,656
Rym: There's like this whole underground city a Mall.

500
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:14,211
Scott: it's an abandoned mall But it happens to be underground making it different from all the other abandoned malls now because it goes all the way back to the 1800.

501
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:14,815
Rym: Some of these tunnels.

502
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:16,949
Rym: there's speakeasies down there and bars.

503
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:18,709
Rym: Yeah, it is.

504
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:23,790
Scott: Every nerd must move to Salem, Oregon and we'll take it over.

505
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:29,030
Scott: We're gonna take it over and it'll be nerd town and we will turn all this awesomeness into nerd city.

506
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,583
Rym: So we have our guest Peter Olson resident GeekNights scientist.

507
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,225
Rym: Hi Pete.

508
00:33:33,566 --> 00:33:34,630
Guest: So, my name is Peter Olson.

509
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:38,810
Guest: I'm a senior food bacteriologist employed by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets.

510
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:51,629
Guest: my job is to test food products from all across the state of New York or The presence of certain food-borne pathogens, I also do Characterization subtyping and lots of other complicated science things.

511
00:33:53,272 --> 00:34:06,230
Guest: So, you know any opinions expressed in this podcast or any writings attached to this podcast That I Express are solely mine and are not necessarily reflective of the stance of the Department of Agriculture and Markets.

512
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:16,270
Guest: further any mention of any specific product website a Private enterprise of any sort does not constitute endorsement of that thing by the Department of Agriculture and Markets.

513
00:34:16,732 --> 00:34:21,580
Rym: Thank you, and we're hoping you could bring us the thing of the day something We used to ask our guests to do and then we forgot.

514
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:23,790
Guest: I just might have a thing of the day for you.

515
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:27,371
Scott: So I I do So.

516
00:34:27,493 --> 00:34:34,956
Guest: anyone who knows me knows that I am not necessarily a huge fan of raw milk But I am.

517
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:40,335
Guest: I'm also not really a fan of the Colbert rapport either though I'm not equating those two things.

518
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:47,279
Guest: the Colbert rapport is definitely better for you than raw milk Or less likely to give you serious gastroenteritis.

519
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:59,334
Scott: So as someone who has experienced severe gastroenteritis and been hospitalized Yeah, as much as people out there probably won't like me saying this I also kind of agree like, you know Colbert obviously has his shtick Yeah, but it's like.

520
00:34:59,936 --> 00:35:05,897
Scott: I personally find it to be only tolerable for like a short amount of yes Colbert just made a movie.

521
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:07,463
Rym: That was the Colbert rapport.

522
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:09,210
Rym: would have been like bar at that would have been great.

523
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,910
Scott: But I mean, it's like you have one joke and you do the joke every day.

524
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:19,225
Rym: It's like well notice how at the rally I went to they Basically had him up there in character and then they killed his characters.

525
00:35:19,245 --> 00:35:20,250
Rym: They could have the serious talk.

526
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:24,509
Guest: Yeah, he definitely does much better as did much better as Stewart straight, man.

527
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:47,210
Guest: so anyway Every now and then the Colbert report does a piece or a segment that I do happen to like and and one such segment aired about a month ago now a little less than a month ago earlier in October and The the story that he discussed concerned arrayed by the FDA on an establishment called raw some foods.

528
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,297
Guest: It's expected really well,

529
00:35:56,558 --> 00:36:00,130
Rym: I mean I if they're selling say beef, I mean I eat raw beef

530
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,470
Scott: Technically and he was ironically saying that the government was correct to raid them.

531
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:09,666
Scott: And since his character is supposed to be the negative he was implying that the government should not have raided them.

532
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:13,360
Guest: Yes Really not the case.

533
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,630
Guest: Well, it's it's an interesting story.

534
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:29,707
Guest: The the allegations were that raw some foods was illegally selling raw milk I can tell it by their name and and they did indeed starters pot palace We're talking about you Taking it back aways.

535
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:37,166
Guest: But yeah no, they found unlicensed raw milk in this establishment and shut them down.

536
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:42,810
Guest: and there was a video of The feds coming in with guns drawn and oh, yeah, very dramatic.

537
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:45,330
Scott: But you know, we need that because the hippies will friggin fight back.

538
00:36:45,592 --> 00:36:50,187
Rym: They take this with what like it like in lock stock Exactly.

539
00:36:50,250 --> 00:37:03,723
Guest: Oh There's a clip out there and this segment is interesting for a number of reasons that it features David Atchison of the FDA who is a fantastic speaker very intelligent man.

540
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,870
Guest: He gives a lot of very great information.

541
00:37:06,412 --> 00:37:07,900
Scott: The like the head head head.

542
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,683
Guest: No, no, no, he's not.

543
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:12,258
Guest: he's not the super head of the FDA But but he's a great communicator.

544
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:19,481
Guest: He was brought on board relatively recently and he's been great for the agency Like the surgeon general or someone technically the head head of the.

545
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:20,624
Guest: it's complicated.

546
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:22,630
Guest: it's really really calm.

547
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,494
Scott: Okay, don't explain it.

548
00:37:23,695 --> 00:37:26,489
Guest: I won't I didn't intend to no intent there.

549
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:32,050
Guest: So the situation itself is also interesting because raw some foods was selling raw milk illegally.

550
00:37:32,531 --> 00:37:42,043
Guest: but it's legal to sell raw milk in a grocery store in the state of California if you go through the proper licensing procedures, so They didn't even bother to go through the licensing procedure.

551
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,330
Guest: No, it was just laziness.

552
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:44,819
Guest: But the reason I'm linking to.

553
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:55,750
Guest: so as a scientist I encounter a lot of bullshit explanations for things in my day-to-day life And of course, they they contribute heavily to my predilection for drinking gin.

554
00:37:56,856 --> 00:38:07,477
Guest: so this one particular Gentlemen that they interviewed from raw some foods Explains why he drinks raw milk.

555
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:17,946
Scott: and you must understand I've heard I've heard a lot of explanations as to why people legitimate reason I can I can take from someone is they like that it tastes better and it's like?

556
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:22,379
Scott: is it worth it to Risk death and illness for that better taste?

557
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:26,190
Scott: and if they say yes, well, that's you know, it's only them drinking it.

558
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:27,676
Guest: There is another guy.

559
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:30,930
Guest: there is a guy who who actually says and I'll spoil this little bit of the interview.

560
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:46,273
Guest: He actually says something I agree with which is that if I if I want to drink raw milk And I know it's going to give me dysentery Then it's my right anyway to proceed as long as I as long as I can agree I can.

561
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:50,690
Rym: I read an article recently talking about how there's been a rise of tuberculosis in a couple of places.

562
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:56,586
Rym: There's a rise in the Mexican border because of people taking raw poorly processed milk and cheese.

563
00:38:56,606 --> 00:39:10,205
Guest: It is hypothesized that Tabra mycobacterium tuberculosis human infecting tuberculosis actually evolved from the naturally occurring Mycobacteria that are present in raw milk and they evolved and adapted to human hosts.

564
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:18,175
Guest: and that's how we got the tuberculosis that we know now it actually came from had been invented and Disseminated earlier.

565
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:19,440
Scott: there would be no tuberculosis.

566
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:21,730
Guest: It is it is it is possible.

567
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:26,042
Guest: We obviously it is hard to go back 300 years and research what happened then.

568
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:31,181
Guest: exactly disprove the holographic universe You and your holographic universe.

569
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:34,795
Guest: But anyway, so there's one guy Holographic universe a interview.

570
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:43,523
Guest: Listen, my mom is a lot of things but I can assure you she is not holographic or pasteurized or Pasteurized that that would be kind of gross.

571
00:39:43,543 --> 00:39:56,063
Guest: But listen, there's one guy Explains why he drinks raw milk and all I can tell you is that it is It's the most outrageous Explanation I've heard in my time as a scientist and I will tell you something.

572
00:39:56,505 --> 00:39:57,849
Guest: I've heard some pretty outrageous stuff.

573
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:01,563
Guest: I'm gonna link this video and I hope you guys enjoy it.

574
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:08,210
Rym: and yeah All right, so very briefly the meta moment the GeekNights book club is World War Z by Max Brooks.

575
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:09,736
Rym: I'm reading it Scott is not.

576
00:40:10,198 --> 00:40:11,041
Scott: I'm gonna read it pretty soon.

577
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:11,905
Rym: You're not reading it now.

578
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,150
Scott: Not this very second.

579
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:13,774
Scott: I'm gonna get to it.

580
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:14,881
Scott: I'm doing a podcast right now.

581
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:15,585
Scott: Yes, very soon.

582
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:19,810
Rym: All right Yep, we're gonna be at MAGFest doing.

583
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:22,356
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX East.

584
00:40:22,396 --> 00:40:23,802
Rym: We're gonna be a pack.

585
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:24,705
Rym: We're gonna be a PAX East.

586
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:30,843
Rym: We're gonna be a pax prime And we're probably gonna be at anime Boston and I think that's all the matter that matters.

587
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:35,500
Rym: the e-commerce for GeekNights And our old t-shirt are gonna be up relatively soon.

588
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:36,103
Rym: snap.

589
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:38,030
Rym: The last regulatory hurdle is complete.

590
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:40,110
Rym: We are now legally authorized to sell t-shirts.

591
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:46,730
Rym: It's just a matter of me turning on the website Right and figuring out what I have to file after we sell to the first person in New York, but that's beside the point.

592
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:55,570
Rym: So yeah tonight we thought you know before we had Pete on the show This was quite some time ago and we talked about pseudo science.

593
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:01,230
Rym: You know the Randy bullshit that we're so angry about all the time and pizza scientists, so we thought he'd be extra angry about.

594
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:08,319
Rym: So now we thought we'd talk about science But we realized science is not.

595
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,347
Rym: there's not a lot to say other than it's science.

596
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:11,069
Rym: It's right G.

597
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:16,830
Scott: What a. what a incredibly specific topic that we can you know discuss for 30 minutes science.

598
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:26,969
Rym: But one thing that we definitely can talk about because it's something very important that I think we all agree needs to be addressed is The state of science education in the world at least in the United States, right?

599
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:34,070
Scott: I mean I'm pretty sure there are other countries where science education is quite good and other countries where it is perhaps even worse.

600
00:41:34,713 --> 00:41:37,950
Scott: But the United States is the country which we know the most about right?

601
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:41,968
Guest: So so the state of science education in the US, huh?

602
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,814
Rym: I think how do we like?

603
00:41:44,095 --> 00:41:48,369
Rym: I guess the fundamental question is how do you teach science is like what?

604
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,919
Rym: constitutes a good science education that that's?

605
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:57,457
Guest: that's a tricky part and a lot of a Lot of how we've taught people science has been.

606
00:41:57,477 --> 00:42:08,430
Guest: it's been a result of how science was 40 or 50 years ago back when Back when the people who were teaching did science and new things and science.

607
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:12,106
Guest: 40 or 50 year old science isn't isn't really that useful.

608
00:42:12,327 --> 00:42:19,095
Guest: these days science can be invalidated in the span of a year or two or You know, so it's like.

609
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:19,758
Scott: so you're saying like.

610
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:23,330
Scott: is it because the science is moving too fast to update the textbooks?

611
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:27,982
Scott: Or is it because well, it's somehow science is fundamentally different now than it was then?

612
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:31,816
Guest: it is moving faster than we are Updating it.

613
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:33,228
Guest: I would I would contend.

614
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,012
Guest: as for science itself Hasn't changed.

615
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:40,896
Guest: I mean it's everybody throws out the word science the science that I think.

616
00:42:40,997 --> 00:42:49,050
Guest: xkcd addressed this very well in a Fantastic comic with Feynman rising from the dead and smacking people down because they were bitching about myth busters.

617
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:58,653
Guest: The core of science will never change which is that ideas are tested by an empirical Experimentation.

618
00:42:58,673 --> 00:42:59,214
Guest: that's it.

619
00:42:59,355 --> 00:43:04,008
Guest: It's rooted in the the most fundamental of skeptical philosophy.

620
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:09,650
Guest: and until Something like their changes then then the root of science is never going to change its investigation.

621
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,610
Guest: Do you think you can I do and we invest easy to teach people?

622
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,661
Rym: Alright, if you don't know how something works try to figure it out.

623
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:17,870
Rym: come up with an idea and test it and see if you're right.

624
00:43:18,131 --> 00:43:27,240
Guest: Well, the problem was for the longest time our education system was built around teaching people information that we knew because there was a period of time

625
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:35,309
Rym: like when they taught me there were five kingdoms and they taught me that You flew because the air is moving faster on top because the shape of the airfoil.

626
00:43:36,353 --> 00:43:43,442
Guest: There was a time way back when you could reasonably know Pretty much all there was to know in science.

627
00:43:43,502 --> 00:43:48,058
Guest: you you could be a scientist You could work in the field of science because there was just one.

628
00:43:48,078 --> 00:43:49,342
Guest: you could be mad.

629
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:51,108
Guest: Yeah, you could be a little crazy.

630
00:43:51,168 --> 00:44:01,365
Guest: and now we live in an era of unprecedented access to information an Unprecedented ability to gather and disseminate information except scientific studies, which are incredibly difficult.

631
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:02,929
Guest: Well, that's that's part of the issue.

632
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:06,083
Guest: Talk about that for a while and I might.

633
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:16,097
Guest: but One of the problems I've seen at least and in in my my day-to-day duties Or The agency for which I work.

634
00:44:16,578 --> 00:44:27,370
Guest: I do have an opportunity to work with students at different grade levels usually college and post-post undergraduate graduate students working in various programs.

635
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:39,580
Guest: Well, it wasn't that long ago that that was peers and now it's children Yes kids and I can tell you that I get you know The the area in which I'm located in.

636
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,950
Scott: these are people district in New York scientists.

637
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:45,630
Guest: These are people who are trying to be scientists who come from reasonable backgrounds.

638
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:49,063
Scott: They didn't just go to public school and take science class.

639
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:51,352
Scott: They actually went to school for sign They.

640
00:44:51,472 --> 00:44:55,766
Guest: they took microbiology courses and they took physics courses and they took math.

641
00:44:55,887 --> 00:45:00,444
Guest: and they are in Programs and are allegedly because I only have an undergraduate degree the.

642
00:45:00,806 --> 00:45:11,610
Guest: these people pursuing upper upper level degrees should Hypothetically be more knowledgeable in the field than I am and that is unfortunately often not the case.

643
00:45:12,532 --> 00:45:21,930
Guest: I I get to experience a wide range of Knowledge bases from these different students and I say what the heck is going on?

644
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,797
Scott: Some of these kids they went to different schools.

645
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:40,070
Guest: I haven't established I have not done sufficient experimentation to draw to Draw a correlation but I can tell you that my my course completely unscientific observation is that it doesn't matter It it really.

646
00:45:41,032 --> 00:45:46,674
Guest: It really just seems to vary with the individual level and I'm not quite sure yet what it is that varies from individual to individual.

647
00:45:46,694 --> 00:45:59,550
Guest: that makes one a better candidate for being a scientist than the other but I could tell you that a lot of these kids that I have Taken under my wing started off knowing jackal about science after going through high school in an undergraduate program.

648
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:08,415
Guest: some of the most basic tenants seem to escape them and I can also tell you that it's not limited to just Undergraduates, it's limb.

649
00:46:08,575 --> 00:46:10,381
Guest: It's it goes to PhDs.

650
00:46:10,482 --> 00:46:12,248
Guest: It goes to people have been in the field for 30 or 40 years.

651
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:19,470
Guest: Sometimes it seems that people just lose their grip on the the fundamental aspects of science.

652
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:23,247
Rym: Well, I remember a very poignant moment in my you know, educational curves.

653
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:34,930
Rym: in 10th grade I was taking like physics in high school and it was like the third week and we're doing experiments and we went outside because it was nice out and We learned all these methods to calculate how far away the Sun was from the earth.

654
00:46:35,412 --> 00:46:40,310
Rym: And we were supposed to figure out how far away the Sun was from the earth using the materials we had available.

655
00:46:40,795 --> 00:46:46,464
Rym: So we did it and you know I was off by like four orders of magnitude because that's what my calculations told me.

656
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:48,029
Rym: Yeah, and everyone was way way off.

657
00:46:48,049 --> 00:46:55,681
Rym: and Afterward he asked us, you know, all right, we were way off and a lot of people were balking like yeah We were way off like why are even bothering with these experiments?

658
00:46:56,424 --> 00:46:59,885
Rym: and he asked us very simply Alright, so how do we know what the right answer is?

659
00:47:02,846 --> 00:47:07,114
Rym: And Someone said well, it's in the textbook But they were smart.

660
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:07,857
Rym: They were smart.

661
00:47:07,877 --> 00:47:14,096
Rym: They stopped as soon as they said that and they said oh wait How'd they get the answer in the textbook?

662
00:47:14,116 --> 00:47:19,010
Rym: and the teacher was like by doing exactly what you did only not being?

663
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:23,853
Guest: And it's it's.

664
00:47:24,034 --> 00:47:24,595
Guest: it's a little.

665
00:47:25,097 --> 00:47:36,210
Guest: it's a little disconcerting that I'm fairly certain those conversations don't happen as often as they need To in science classrooms, obviously, I haven't studied science classrooms extensively.

666
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:43,430
Guest: it's been a long time since I've been in a high school classroom or even a an undergraduate college classroom.

667
00:47:44,232 --> 00:47:55,410
Guest: But I can tell you that that my experiences and from what I have gathered of other people's experiences from talking to them There's really not so much emphasis on the critical thinking aspects of science.

668
00:47:55,430 --> 00:48:10,350
Guest: Which is really the most critical component of any scientific investigation is how to take these observations and these data that you've gathered and Analyze them and how to break them down into their fundamental components and understand how they interact with each other.

669
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:10,975
Guest: what do they tell you?

670
00:48:10,995 --> 00:48:12,588
Guest: what what conclusions can you draw?

671
00:48:12,608 --> 00:48:21,550
Guest: and how are your conclusions limited which I find is one of the things that gets lost in the public perceptions of Sciences.

672
00:48:22,293 --> 00:48:31,736
Guest: When whenever a study comes up we see this all the time somebody says science cures Pretty much about everything.

673
00:48:31,756 --> 00:48:32,680
Scott: just read XKCD.

674
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,768
Guest: Randall Monroe was right about a lot of things.

675
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:38,325
Rym: Yeah That was the other discussion about significant digits.

676
00:48:38,526 --> 00:48:39,972
Scott: anything is beat though It's like you're.

677
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:47,284
Scott: you're upset because you've got these people who went to school and learned some science But then no it turns out they didn't actually learn the science, right?

678
00:48:47,686 --> 00:48:48,470
Scott: Right, but here's the thing.

679
00:48:48,631 --> 00:48:50,150
Scott: Yeah, look at us computer people.

680
00:48:50,491 --> 00:48:59,018
Scott: They don't even have high school classes and computers and when they do they're not mandatory and when they do It's not taught by anyone who knows any.

681
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:04,049
Rym: I mean at least I mean you look at the average like freshman computer science or IT Person even at a prestigious tech school.

682
00:49:04,672 --> 00:49:09,789
Rym: They come in and unless they're a nerd who already knows how to code it'd be the equivalent of someone coming to you.

683
00:49:10,191 --> 00:49:17,270
Rym: They've got their bachelors and they're like, I'm ready to do some science and they don't actually know anything more than that.

684
00:49:18,753 --> 00:49:19,768
Guest: They know are a bunch of facts.

685
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:24,417
Rym: They're like I learned how.

686
00:49:24,437 --> 00:49:26,604
Rym: to you know how to turn my graphing calculator on?

687
00:49:26,805 --> 00:49:28,209
Rym: teach me how to do science with it.

688
00:49:28,772 --> 00:49:32,050
Guest: Yeah, no, I've encountered roughly that that same level of calm.

689
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,157
Scott: That is that's pretty scary.

690
00:49:34,217 --> 00:49:43,105
Guest: I mean consider, you know, not not often not often Usually usually most students I get have memorized factual information and can reproduce it at me.

691
00:49:43,266 --> 00:49:46,218
Guest: when I ask them then I ask them What does that mean?

692
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,950
Guest: How did we arrive at that data?

693
00:49:48,232 --> 00:49:50,306
Guest: How can you apply these data in other situations?

694
00:49:50,548 --> 00:49:50,769
Guest: They go.

695
00:49:53,673 --> 00:50:09,310
Rym: I feel like I had an extraordinary at least science education compared to other high schools because These things were dealt with very well like for example, like with these examples I mean, why did I professor would always like we do a professor the teacher We'd always like do an experiment or something or learn an equation like he said simple ones.

696
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:16,869
Rym: He said F equals ma force equals mass times acceleration and he put it on the board and he paused Looked at us and he asks, what does that imply?

697
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:21,326
Rym: and We went for a week on just the implications and the ramifications of that.

698
00:50:21,346 --> 00:50:24,518
Rym: Mm-hmm And I is it just that no one does that.

699
00:50:24,578 --> 00:50:27,809
Rym: I mean, it wasn't hard to have the science education I had.

700
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:33,623
Scott: I'm not a science genius by any stretch, but it's like I think.

701
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:35,589
Scott: I think that I know things.

702
00:50:36,052 --> 00:50:38,390
Guest: Yeah, a lot of people think they know things.

703
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:45,213
Guest: I think we could point to a lot of people who think they know things and this is part of the problem with science education.

704
00:50:45,233 --> 00:50:50,409
Guest: science is all about figuring out how little you actually know and rectifying that problem.

705
00:50:50,429 --> 00:50:52,554
Guest: and We we get into this.

706
00:50:53,076 --> 00:51:03,408
Guest: we tend to get into a situation where people will draw conclusions and say well this conclusion is definite because they sort of misinterpret the some of the fundamental aspects of science about.

707
00:51:03,629 --> 00:51:04,231
Guest: you know How we.

708
00:51:04,472 --> 00:51:25,390
Guest: we have a theory or perhaps some set of conclusions that are valid until something more valid comes along And then people will often Engage in confirmation bias and other such things to Shoot down every single competing Anything that comes along to try to keep clinging to this this principle that they found so many years ago.

709
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:35,510
Guest: And and this is this is something that I've observed not just in Scientists in general and in science fields at large but but out in the public at large.

710
00:51:35,591 --> 00:51:36,710
Rym: So would you would you agree with this?

711
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:59,721
Rym: I have this feeling just based on the scientists and the teachers the professors I've met over the years that the ones who were the best were the ones who's like they got more joy from Disproving something then from verifying something like the people who are really driven were the ones who love nothing more than to take some established theory and Absolutely disprove it or even their own theory and disprove it and be like, alright check this out I disprove my theory that I spent 40 years working on.

712
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:00,425
Rym: how awesome is that?

713
00:52:00,927 --> 00:52:01,249
Guest: It's you?

714
00:52:01,269 --> 00:52:04,697
Guest: well There aren't very many of those people.

715
00:52:04,737 --> 00:52:04,958
Guest: we.

716
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:07,206
Guest: there's a story in the god delusion.

717
00:52:07,246 --> 00:52:14,442
Guest: I think it was Richard Dawkins Reflected a story about a scientist who had Talked about I forget the exact the exact theorem you.

718
00:52:14,502 --> 00:52:16,130
Rym: I think I remember this anecdote.

719
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:18,238
Guest: But anyway, you know, he'd been a scientist for 40 years.

720
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:30,275
Guest: and then he walked up and he congratulated the guy who just proved him Wrong, he said I've espoused this thing 40 years and you just proved me wrong and everybody clapped their hands raw And I got to tell you that doesn't happen Didn't happen that one time.

721
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,540
Scott: Yeah made up story.

722
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,427
Guest: It happened that one time probably.

723
00:52:33,447 --> 00:52:38,703
Guest: I don't know I wasn't there I'm not Richard Dawkins, but it's nice to think that that is what happens.

724
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:50,322
Guest: but scientists are people people are fallible and The majority case is that a PhD will cling tenaciously to their the research They've been doing for the past 40 years because it's what they've been doing for the past 40 years.

725
00:52:50,362 --> 00:52:51,927
Guest: They depend on that research.

726
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:59,310
Guest: So It's nice to say that that the principles of science are that we will abandon something as soon as it is disproven.

727
00:52:59,772 --> 00:53:08,340
Guest: But it is not often that somebody will just abandon a Particular theory wholesale, so we're screwed.

728
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,769
Rym: I mean, that's what about the non scientists?

729
00:53:10,809 --> 00:53:12,749
Guest: Yeah No, you guys you guys are pretty much hosed.

730
00:53:16,733 --> 00:53:19,042
Scott: Tell you what to do, but this is sort of a separate problem right?

731
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:28,230
Scott: the the the problems between Scientists in academia and fighting over getting published and getting you know, all sorts of stuff like that, right?

732
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:34,890
Scott: It's like that is sort of a separate problem that perhaps is intertwined with the problem of the students not learning anything.

733
00:53:34,991 --> 00:53:36,279
Guest: Oh, yeah, so how does that can?

734
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,790
Scott: how does the one affect the other?

735
00:53:38,751 --> 00:53:51,210
Guest: Well when you have scientists who have to compete very viciously for funding that's coming from many different sources a lot of them will Try as hard as they possibly can to get students to produce as much work as possible.

736
00:53:52,032 --> 00:54:06,970
Guest: You'll often find this in Colleges where a professor has a laboratory and they use their graduate students or undergraduate students as slave labor slave labor To produce as much work as possible to get as much noise out there as they can to make as big a name as possible.

737
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:07,896
Rym: I wish I could do that.

738
00:54:08,177 --> 00:54:10,230
Rym: I want to get some interns to like migrate machines.

739
00:54:11,631 --> 00:54:13,201
Guest: Again, I get interns every now and then.

740
00:54:13,261 --> 00:54:15,473
Guest: it is pretty awesome to have interns I'm not gonna lie.

741
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:17,924
Guest: I even get full-fledged employees that I can boss around to.

742
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:21,715
Guest: it's a lot of fun, but There there are some.

743
00:54:22,096 --> 00:54:38,389
Guest: there are some side effects to this and it is the person who is Willing to make the most noise makes the most noise and they get the most funding whether or not their science is the best or or Perhaps the most used for what should be being done.

744
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:38,510
Guest: now.

745
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:48,428
Guest: I don't need to disparage any scientist who is doing a lot of hard work because I know many many very hard-working scientists who publish a lot of really good earth-shattering groundbreaking data.

746
00:54:49,213 --> 00:54:52,430
Rym: Wait, those are the mad scientists shattering the ground breaking the earth.

747
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:58,350
Guest: Yeah, all scientists at some point, especially when you when you publish very extensively go a little mad.

748
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:04,734
Guest: so So we have this this Massive problem.

749
00:55:04,774 --> 00:55:05,216
Guest: really it's.

750
00:55:05,316 --> 00:55:06,119
Guest: it's just pervasive.

751
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:13,217
Guest: everybody kind of misuses the scientific method One of the scientific methods.

752
00:55:13,237 --> 00:55:21,370
Guest: there really is no global method but a lot of people just kind of spin science To suit their own ends and it's it's unfortunate science.

753
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:29,560
Guest: The the scientific process is easily spun because it's neutral by default It it doesn't care about what you want.

754
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:34,417
Scott: It just gives you information and then you have How did it get this way?

755
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:37,210
Scott: Was it ever good before or was it never good?

756
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:38,394
Guest: No, it was probably never good.

757
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,744
Guest: Well, well, it was never it was never.

758
00:55:40,764 --> 00:55:42,290
Scott: I mean you say it was never good.

759
00:55:42,431 --> 00:55:44,050
Scott: But meanwhile, we still have.

760
00:55:45,231 --> 00:55:48,378
Rym: I would argue that the scientific process is fine.

761
00:55:48,438 --> 00:55:50,563
Rym: The people interpreting the results are.

762
00:55:50,643 --> 00:55:51,686
Guest: it's how it's it's.

763
00:55:52,548 --> 00:55:52,668
Guest: it's.

764
00:55:53,813 --> 00:55:59,744
Guest: the problem we have now is that Science as I said before used to be a thing that you could just know.

765
00:55:59,865 --> 00:56:00,768
Guest: you could grasp all of it.

766
00:56:01,551 --> 00:56:03,236
Guest: There used to be less information.

767
00:56:03,557 --> 00:56:04,580
Guest: We just had less.

768
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:05,403
Guest: we knew less.

769
00:56:05,864 --> 00:56:12,829
Guest: when we knew less things It was easier to figure out those few things that we knew really easy.

770
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:16,610
Guest: It's sort of like when there were only four books.

771
00:56:17,192 --> 00:56:20,870
Guest: They were all really good books because they were the only four books we had.

772
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:28,214
Scott: So it's like we had the specialization and the specialization has you know caused it's the you know And they've all sort of.

773
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:38,101
Guest: it's not really the specialization the techniques of science Like how we've applied them for the longest time has always been Exploratory in nature finding more information.

774
00:56:38,222 --> 00:56:40,309
Guest: I can give you an example the kind of work that I do.

775
00:56:40,891 --> 00:56:49,539
Guest: Where we test food samples from across the state of New York or various pathogens I Generate a shocking amount of data in a week.

776
00:56:49,579 --> 00:57:02,945
Guest: You could you could take multiple PhDs and give them Graduate projects build entire careers analyzing data that I've generated in a week All right, and it's it's pretty shocking the amount of data that we can actually produce.

777
00:57:03,306 --> 00:57:06,390
Guest: and the problem we have now Is that except for scientists?

778
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:11,562
Guest: Most people are not very good at processing that amount of information.

779
00:57:11,582 --> 00:57:14,170
Guest: There's literally just too much stuff out there.

780
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:17,510
Rym: I've been making for a long time and a lot of other computers.

781
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:18,133
Rym: That's all that.

782
00:57:18,153 --> 00:57:27,070
Rym: knowledge of statistics is probably one of the most important things we could teach now Because a lot of people don't understand the ramifications or the meaningfulness of data.

783
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:31,393
Guest: Oh, yeah, that is that is pretty much the critical problem with the awesome TED talk I saw.

784
00:57:31,474 --> 00:57:33,870
Scott: basically this guy made a good few minute argument.

785
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,342
Scott: He's basically like look we do all this math in school.

786
00:57:36,402 --> 00:57:37,970
Scott: math in school and we build up to.

787
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:46,609
Scott: Calculus is like the big thing you're building up to right but calculus almost nobody You know very few people actually need or use calculus on a day-to-day basis.

788
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:53,710
Scott: You know as fun as it is probability and statistics Everyone needs to use every day even probably before they're gonna learn it in school.

789
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:59,250
Scott: You need to use it from the time you're like - right yet You don't learn that unless you learn it like in college extra.

790
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:03,712
Scott: So he said that we should have probably statistics be like the thing now People.

791
00:58:03,752 --> 00:58:08,588
Rym: I think this is where gaming can be used very well because the quickest way to learn statistics is to lose money.

792
00:58:08,628 --> 00:58:21,610
Rym: playing craps All the kids would show up yeah or just D&D I mean every lunch period all through middle school we would play poker for money.

793
00:58:21,691 --> 00:58:22,408
Scott: Well, didn't you see that?

794
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:29,495
Scott: the guy who was talking about how his kids got really good at doing math by playing Pokemon the card game because they basically How much damage does he do?

795
00:58:29,635 --> 00:58:33,330
Scott: uh, and he was doing math really fast so he could play pokemons better.

796
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,820
Rym: Yep, that's how I learned computing.

797
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:40,524
Guest: I wanted to play DOS games And this is part of the problem we have with with getting information to people.

798
00:58:40,564 --> 00:58:50,260
Guest: is you have to present it to them in such A way that it makes sense to them that they can that they can reason with it and a lot of a lot of these problems are.

799
00:58:50,761 --> 00:59:11,529
Guest: so you publish a scientific journal article and I'm gonna set aside the fact that 99.99% of you can never access the full text of an article to actually look at the the testing that they do and The greater problem which is that 99.99% of you wouldn't even understand what the hell that means Even if you could read the whole article.

800
00:59:13,072 --> 00:59:13,654
Rym: I asked Lisa.

801
00:59:13,674 --> 00:59:14,679
Rym: I was there's some article.

802
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:15,342
Rym: I forgot what it was.

803
00:59:15,383 --> 00:59:15,805
Rym: now was like.

804
00:59:16,106 --> 00:59:16,930
Rym: Yeah, I read the abstract.

805
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:17,895
Rym: It was really awesome.

806
00:59:17,915 --> 00:59:18,297
Rym: And she's like.

807
00:59:18,317 --> 00:59:19,241
Rym: I can get you the real article.

808
00:59:19,281 --> 00:59:20,869
Rym: I'm like, yes now I will understand it.

809
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:21,652
Guest: No, you won't.

810
00:59:22,053 --> 00:59:22,996
Rym: Oh, it's a lot of words.

811
00:59:23,057 --> 00:59:26,167
Rym: I actually don't recognize and looking them up did not help.

812
00:59:26,488 --> 00:59:26,729
Rym: Nope.

813
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:28,777
Scott: Yep That's that's often how you look it up.

814
00:59:28,797 --> 00:59:30,967
Scott: The definition consists of more words.

815
00:59:30,987 --> 00:59:38,870
Rym: You don't recognize Yeah, but but the major problem is no it's worse when they consist entirely of words that I recognize and yet combined mean nothing to me.

816
00:59:39,111 --> 00:59:41,402
Scott: I wish that they would just translate them into plain English.

817
00:59:41,443 --> 00:59:42,770
Guest: There's there's no way to we.

818
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,560
Guest: Well, the part of it is there.

819
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,110
Guest: there is of course a problem with the way that journal articles are published.

820
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,260
Guest: You you pay by the word to publish an article.

821
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:55,720
Guest: that is which is which is why Scientific writing is often incomprehensible.

822
00:59:56,061 --> 01:00:05,150
Guest: We basically condense it to the point where it's barely Recognizable English to get it out there as to get as much information into a small space as possible.

823
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:09,730
Rym: At the same time Scott you want to change like translate it into like simple English like component.

824
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:17,058
Rym: No, that's like making but they can assembly like if they didn't people to read they would just write it, you know Normally just what do you mean normally?

825
01:00:17,419 --> 01:00:31,372
Scott: just like, you know, the way that you would say it if you were explaining Roxy zone does the whatchamacallit explaining it to the scientists next to you and you had all the time in the world and you just had to explain the whole Thing you would use Right.

826
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:34,442
Guest: Well, no, no, we would use scientific lingo because that's what we do.

827
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:36,730
Scott: Yes, but it would not be nearly as in government.

828
01:00:37,072 --> 01:00:40,226
Rym: Yes, no, no, it actually would be more Scott when I tell you for computing.

829
01:00:40,286 --> 01:00:44,059
Rym: I'm like, yeah We'll set up an SSH tunnel for the people.

830
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:52,370
Guest: that doesn't mean anything to most people and because it's because scientists are usually Extremely busy people we don't have a lot of time to talk to anyone very extensively about anything.

831
01:00:52,471 --> 01:00:55,290
Guest: So we need to convey the information to you as quickly as possible.

832
01:00:55,611 --> 01:01:00,470
Guest: I hope you're noticing a trend here about how science information is conveyed to people.

833
01:01:00,811 --> 01:01:13,155
Guest: It's as quickly as possible as dense as possible as much information as we can in as small a space as we possibly can or as Little information as we can in the smallest soundbite as we can possibly so Interestingly enough there is.

834
01:01:13,175 --> 01:01:16,506
Guest: I can give you one example of somebody who is doing something right here.

835
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:25,396
Guest: There is a Project run by a guy in Kansas State University named Doug Powell In conjunction with several other people.

836
01:01:25,597 --> 01:01:27,162
Guest: this guy named Ben Chapman Canada.

837
01:01:27,543 --> 01:01:29,750
Guest: It is called barf blog and this relates specifically.

838
01:01:31,632 --> 01:01:34,641
Guest: This relates very specifically to food safety science.

839
01:01:34,741 --> 01:01:36,326
Guest: I'm a food safety microbiologist.

840
01:01:36,366 --> 01:01:36,888
Guest: This is what I do.

841
01:01:36,948 --> 01:01:37,630
Guest: It's my bread and butter.

842
01:01:38,134 --> 01:01:46,453
Guest: It's it's very public health related Raw butter.

843
01:01:46,473 --> 01:01:48,579
Scott: even look like if y'all like.

844
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:52,130
Guest: I've seen raw butter before in in the midst during things.

845
01:01:54,135 --> 01:01:55,107
Guest: But no, it's not.

846
01:01:56,094 --> 01:01:56,520
Guest: It's really.

847
01:01:56,541 --> 01:02:00,550
Scott: it's smell Like you don't want to take the raw milk from the cow you put in a butter.

848
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,517
Guest: Do you guys know what a cow smells like you ever smelled?

849
01:02:02,577 --> 01:02:10,022
Guest: Yeah Well, grab the udder and just tug a few times.

850
01:02:10,183 --> 01:02:11,668
Guest: it's a little more complicated than that.

851
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:12,370
Guest: don't do that you'll get.

852
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:19,140
Guest: There's a lot of poop around the udder around the cow.

853
01:02:20,372 --> 01:02:22,941
Guest: The milk smells like poop all the time.

854
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:25,490
Guest: a lot of raw milk products smell very vague.

855
01:02:25,751 --> 01:02:28,380
Rym: I watched a farmer literally squirted into his mouth.

856
01:02:28,781 --> 01:02:29,885
Guest: Yeah, I cannot.

857
01:02:29,966 --> 01:02:31,190
Guest: that is so unsanitary.

858
01:02:32,994 --> 01:02:34,040
Scott: Maybe I have a theory.

859
01:02:34,462 --> 01:02:35,870
Scott: farmers scat.

860
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,008
Scott: It makes sense.

861
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:46,813
Guest: So anyway barf blog it is a blog and I'm.

862
01:02:46,995 --> 01:02:48,869
Guest: I'm going to tell you that you should read it.

863
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:53,149
Guest: I don't know if you want to subscribe to it because they post like 40 things a day.

864
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:54,915
Scott: Whoa, that is so it's.

865
01:02:55,035 --> 01:02:55,978
Guest: it's a hardcore blog.

866
01:02:55,998 --> 01:02:57,522
Guest: These guys are totally dedicated to it.

867
01:02:57,583 --> 01:03:00,090
Guest: And what they do is a really neat.

868
01:03:00,712 --> 01:03:06,620
Guest: They take all of this this crazy food safety information and they make cool infographics.

869
01:03:06,923 --> 01:03:10,315
Guest: they make Plain language articles.

870
01:03:10,857 --> 01:03:27,270
Guest: they summarize information in a way that is accessible to the modern reader to You know Joe whoever in Wichita, Kansas Anybody can read these articles and understand what they have a fifth-grade reading level or does it need at least a reasonable adult reading?

871
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:35,350
Guest: I would say if you are probably 16 years old you can grasp our blog well enough.

872
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:41,690
Guest: So they they condense these articles into a plain language that is understandable to modern reader and this is exactly what you want.

873
01:03:41,931 --> 01:03:44,037
Guest: Yes, it's a fantastic movement.

874
01:03:44,097 --> 01:03:46,945
Guest: I think more areas of science need to do things like this.

875
01:03:47,547 --> 01:03:48,610
Guest: It's it's very small.

876
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:53,350
Guest: It's a very very focused topic, but it's a great start and I tell everyone about it.

877
01:03:53,631 --> 01:03:57,550
Guest: I get a lot of my food safety, you know articles that I spit out to other people about it.

878
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:58,989
Guest: I say just go read these guys.

879
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:08,583
Guest: They'll explain it to you because I don't have time to sit here for three hours and explain to you The the full details of why this particular outbreak is significant.

880
01:04:08,704 --> 01:04:10,669
Guest: these guys already did it and they're very good at it.

881
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,670
Scott: So that maybe that maybe that's what we need.

882
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:26,510
Scott: Maybe we need someone to basically when you if I go to like, you know, PubMed or whatever And there's some scientific paper that I can only see the abstract for right, you know I mean even if I could read the paper we already discussed I won't be able to understand it.

883
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:34,610
Scott: But maybe we need some guy whose job it is is basically do the bar blog job and write that is normal article Like that for every single paper.

884
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:36,798
Guest: That's the easiest in the first place to start.

885
01:04:36,858 --> 01:04:51,745
Guest: what I would like to see eventually is and this is one of my pet Projects is full public health and well full public science education reform to shift away from Information gathering to information processing because we can gather information really?

886
01:04:51,785 --> 01:04:54,514
Guest: Well, we need to teach Everyone.

887
01:04:54,715 --> 01:05:01,810
Guest: every individual person needs to be able to understand how to process information How to grasp the limits of a study.

888
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,298
Guest: What is this actually saying?

889
01:05:03,338 --> 01:05:05,630
Guest: and you know, how far does the scope actually apply?

890
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:15,569
Guest: And that's something that we need to do in the classroom at home in every media to which people are exposed And that that's really what the mission needs to be.

891
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:21,086
Guest: We we really need to instead of just throwing around pretty charts to spin our points.

892
01:05:21,607 --> 01:05:28,927
Guest: We really need to Break things down and explain them and explain to people how they work and how you draw those conclusions.

893
01:05:28,947 --> 01:05:36,470
Guest: because until we do that Normal people are gonna look at information and just believe it because they don't know how to process it.

894
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:37,798
Guest: They don't know how to question it.

895
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,850
Guest: They don't know how to think about it critically.

896
01:05:41,131 --> 01:05:42,817
Guest: And that that that problem.

897
01:05:42,878 --> 01:05:46,270
Guest: now we actually have people who interpret and present information.

898
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:53,690
Guest: This is something that we've found in doing consumer studies people how people respond to package labeling on foods.

899
01:05:54,174 --> 01:05:56,210
Guest: This is how consumers get a lot of their safety information.

900
01:05:56,631 --> 01:05:59,118
Guest: It comes from the people selling them the product.

901
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:07,842
Guest: the people selling them the product know how to interpret the information to make it Most attractive to the person who is trying to buy.

902
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:24,170
Guest: it supports the immune system It's like that and that there are all kinds of things wrapped up in that and people are very very very good at Staying within the bounds of the law and allowing people to draw conclusions based on the things they have never actually said.

903
01:06:25,252 --> 01:06:32,026
Guest: But using all of the other details about packaging or presentation Cheerios, I won't have a heart attack and die.

904
01:06:32,107 --> 01:06:38,250
Scott: Yeah, okay It's because there's a picture of a heart on it, right and and and because they've they've thrown some some information at you.

905
01:06:38,712 --> 01:06:39,717
Guest: Wow, that must be good.

906
01:06:39,858 --> 01:06:42,150
Guest: or you know, organic food must be better for you.

907
01:06:42,271 --> 01:06:43,949
Guest: So I'm gonna buy nothing but organic food.

908
01:06:47,792 --> 01:07:11,070
Guest: There are all kinds of examples of these sorts of things and while they often have a degree of scientific merit until we can get people Really able to investigate and ask the right sorts of questions Will will basically have a population that just believes what other people tell them and that is sort of the antithesis of science Everybody kind of needs to turn into a skeptical jackass in order for science to work.

909
01:07:17,553 --> 01:07:20,090
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

Rym: you can do your real opening.

928
01:08:53,738 --> 01:08:54,840
Rym: it's Monday November.

929
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,701
Scott: You couldn't even look to make sure Was like.

930
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:16,479
Rym: I don't know I don't I don't have to look at you.

931
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,319
Rym: I was looking at my beyond began well before you begin.

932
01:09:22,281 --> 01:09:25,960
Scott: Yawning is contagious, you know, and they still know the purpose of yawning.
