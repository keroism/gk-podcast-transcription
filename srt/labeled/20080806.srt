00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,325
Rym: It's Wednesday August 6th.

2
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:12,087
Rym: I'm Rym.

00:00:12,247 --> 00:00:14,935
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:18,580
Rym: very briefly and somewhat disorganized Lee we talked about ConnectiCon.

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:39,160
Rym: Well, it's Wednesday the Wednesday before Otak on which means I don't know how how good our show will be tonight because we got to get on the road at like 8 in the morning.

7
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:40,907
Scott: I'm doing laundry as we speak.

8
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,115
Scott: I have unpacking things as we speak.

9
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:52,088
Scott: I'm rearranging the computer Still putting together two of our panels and Tomorrow morning in the car we go to be more.

10
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:53,231
Rym: Oh and don't forget.

11
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:54,815
Rym: We might have a sixth panel.

12
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:56,600
Rym: what we'll see about that?

13
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:59,452
Scott: Well only four of the panels we're doing so.

14
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:03,280
Rym: yes one of them will be there, but Katzen or you'll be doing most of it.

15
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:13,807
Rym: I'll be up there in armor fighting for my honor that smelly armor I feel bad for you and Scott will be in the background far away from the fighting with a video camera to catalog my Untimely demise.

16
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:14,976
Scott: yeah, that'll be worth it.

17
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:20,336
Rym: I guess Yeah, but you know once again welcome all you.

18
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:21,140
Rym: ConnectiCon listeners.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,231
Rym: I'm sure you're here for the con report that we promised yesterday.

20
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:29,615
Rym: as you know GeekNights is four nights a week blah blah blah and Wednesdays is anime manga and comics.

21
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:35,220
Scott: Oh my god Are we gonna talk about anime manga comics not a lot?

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,036
Rym: We're gonna talk about an anime con because you know as I said we're going to Otak on tomorrow.

23
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,040
Rym: things are a little crazy.

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,635
Scott: I don't know that you know before we actually get to it.

25
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:42,937
Scott: You know.

26
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:43,340
Scott: I don't know.

27
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:44,709
Scott: I mean sure we're gonna do.

28
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,758
Scott: we are gonna do the ConnectiCon review tonight But I really feel either it should have been split up into Tuesday Wednesday or more.

29
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,982
Scott: really I think more.

30
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:55,693
Scott: just Tuesday ConnectiCon is an everything geek con.

31
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:58,200
Scott: It's not just anime manga and comics.

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,842
Scott: You know it's all.

33
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:03,780
Scott: it's got web comics, but it's got a lot of gaming going on there a lot.

34
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:08,460
Scott: And you know I feel like maybe even the ConnectiCon review should be on a Tuesday.

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,912
Scott: Or maybe we should move all convention related things to Thursday, or I don't know.

36
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:20,453
Rym: see what I'm thinking is anime cons We should talk about on Wednesdays Cons we should talk about on Tuesdays ConnectiCon and things like that.

37
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:22,800
Rym: We should probably talk about on Thursdays.

38
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:27,440
Scott: Yeah, well that's okay, then because you know what we were supposed to do a Thursday episode this week.

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,063
Scott: What do you say?

40
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:30,980
Scott: we put this episode up and just tomorrow now?

41
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:32,675
Rym: We should put it up tonight because it's a Wednesday show.

42
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,105
Scott: yeah But I mean it should be.

43
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,740
Scott: you know we are supposed to do a Thursday this week and not a Wednesday.

44
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:46,000
Rym: Yeah, but there are recording it Wednesday because we have to leave Thursday, so Whatever, it'll be a Wednesday show because we said it would be and we'll kind of rearrange all this business.

45
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:46,746
Scott: It's okay.

46
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,724
Scott: We can do some post-hoc retcon Haha later.

47
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:58,817
Rym: and also just in case you're wondering we're gonna be out of town next week on our annual writers retreat Which is a codename for doing jack and shit and fuck and all.

48
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,792
Scott: but Have no fear and you're in mom.

49
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:09,615
Rym: for the many previous years We would have guest hosts of GeekNights and this year We I totally dropped the ball and didn't follow up on any of that at all.

50
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:10,960
Scott: I mean we had some volunteers.

51
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:12,726
Rym: We didn't really follow up.

52
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,074
Scott: We went around and some people agreed to it.

53
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:16,940
Scott: some people couldn't do it on time.

54
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:26,467
Scott: Basically we are too busy doing other shit, and we didn't do it and we suck however Instead of not doing shows for a week.

55
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,576
Rym: We're gonna be in Wildwood, but we've got internet access.

56
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:32,252
Rym: We've got a Marantz We've got our microphones.

57
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,080
Rym: We've got everything.

58
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:36,880
Rym: We're gonna do some GeekNights live at the beach.

59
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:39,480
Scott: We're gonna try to do some GeekNights live at the beach.

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,359
Rym: I promise there will be at least one episode of GeekNights uploaded at some point next week.

61
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,090
Scott: That is very likely more than one.

62
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,114
Scott: I wouldn't bet.

63
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:49,580
Rym: maybe not maybe or four.

64
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:53,028
Scott: No to it most people.

65
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:53,851
Scott: that's what you're gonna get.

66
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:54,253
Scott: maybe?

67
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:55,920
Rym: yeah, we might have GeekNights live at the beach.

68
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:57,820
Rym: We might have GeekNights live in Atlantic City.

69
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:59,306
Scott: Also, here's something else right.

70
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:13,463
Scott: if you want to do a guest episode of GeekNights and you can record it and edit the whole mp3 and do the whole thing on your own and Email either email it to us or better yet email us a link to a place We can download it.

71
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:17,774
Scott: then we could actually go and pretty easily.

72
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:23,905
Scott: if we just go to internet cafe You know go and add it to the website, so all right I'm gonna say it right now.

73
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:27,060
Rym: not many of you are capable of doing no very few people.

74
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:32,600
Scott: I mean we're gonna listen to it And we're gonna make a pretty quick judgment like within a minute of whether we deem it worthy.

75
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:38,700
Rym: You mean like all those people who came from Connecticut and have already turned us off exactly exactly all right.

76
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,702
Rym: So we're unlike the normal format of GeekNights because you know we got to get this show on the road as in go to Baltimore.

77
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:49,860
Rym: so we're gonna dispense with the usual news and kind of just right get right into this Connecticut thing.

78
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,492
Rym: But first I do want to point out last weekend Connecticut this weekend Otakon.

79
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:04,538
Rym: so August 8th 9th and 10th We're gonna be in Baltimore at Otakon doing a ton of live shows too many if there is such a thing.

80
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:08,448
Rym: so Friday noon to 1 in panel 1 anime.

81
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:13,280
Rym: you should see this has been the standing room only like batshit crazy panel.

82
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,909
Scott: I don't know why but I guess it works.

83
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:16,671
Rym: I know exactly.

84
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:17,936
Scott: do it works right?

85
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:20,587
Scott: if you don't understand it You don't like it.

86
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,220
Rym: It's confusing, but we know we understand exactly.

87
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:24,991
Rym: It's easy to get into anime.

88
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:26,500
Rym: a lot of people got into anime.

89
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:29,453
Rym: They don't know what to watch after they watch it.

90
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:30,035
Scott: You know what I'm gonna.

91
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:34,940
Scott: Do is after that panel I'm gonna ask people like why they came to it and really see what they're thinking.

92
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,121
Scott: Well,

93
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:41,119
Rym: we asked him last year and more than half the crowd raised their hands at I don't know what to watch now

94
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:41,944
Scott: Uh-huh,

95
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:48,880
Rym: and then like the other third was pretty much It was a half of them were I don't know what to watch and the rest didn't really were non-committal.

96
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:52,600
Rym: Uh-huh, yeah, and you know it is kind of hard to figure out what to watch.

97
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,489
Rym: I mean how many good shows are there?

98
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,956
Rym: not just an anime, but in any.

99
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:56,820
Scott: this is what I don't get.

100
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:58,666
Scott: I mean It's like these people.

101
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:10,049
Scott: the only explanation I could think of is that these people don't talk to anyone And they don't go on the internet at all and they don't even read Scott Scott, and they don't even What magazine tells you what anime is good.

102
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,459
Scott: it tells you at least something.

103
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:17,100
Scott: it It might tell you wrong, but at least you'll listen to it and watch something bad.

104
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:21,540
Rym: No, and then they watch bad things and everything they watch is bad, and then they stop watching anime.

105
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:22,751
Scott: I know, but what what?

106
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:23,719
Rym: do they go on the internet?

107
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:24,741
Rym: Where do you?

108
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:29,880
Rym: unless you listen to animal world order us or maybe fast karate people are gonna tell you to watch bad shows?

109
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:37,954
Rym: Probably there's really nowhere to get Reliable recommendations for anime to watch except GeekNights anime world order and fast karate.

110
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:40,220
Scott: for the gentleman there had to be somebody.

111
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:41,725
Rym: I defy you.

112
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,490
Scott: it's gotta be some blogs out there.

113
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,711
Rym: All right.

114
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:44,613
Rym: There's one blog.

115
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,740
Rym: That's okay that ba ba suga su.

116
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,140
Rym: However that blog reviews everything and the reviews really kind of glowing.

117
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,798
Scott: I mean these people really must live under a rock if you go.

118
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,998
Scott: gee I don't know what anime to watch at all.

119
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:56,180
Rym: I mean.

120
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,625
Scott: I think we just I know too many.

121
00:06:57,665 --> 00:07:00,074
Scott: I know more anime to watch than I can watch.

122
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:01,720
Rym: no anime that you know are good.

123
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,085
Rym: I mean basically think of this.

124
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:05,152
Rym: you just got into anime like you've.

125
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:08,785
Rym: someone said hey watch this anime you watch Akira And it was awesome.

126
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:10,832
Rym: and now in a vacuum you think all right.

127
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:11,816
Rym: I liked Akira.

128
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:12,860
Rym: I like anime.

129
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:15,373
Rym: What should I watch?

130
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:21,020
Scott: at the very least I go to the best But I look at the shelf and I pick something judging on the cover way way way in the title way.

131
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,608
Rym: That's not gonna get you very far.

132
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:23,010
Rym: Yeah.

133
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,271
Rym: Well.

134
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:25,040
Rym: No it won't go to Best Buy.

135
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:34,316
Rym: Anyway, I think I understand exactly why this panel is because it is hard to find out What good anime is out there because the industry is not conducive to people watching good anime anymore.

136
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:34,778
Rym: Well.

137
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:35,400
Scott: That's for sure.

138
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:36,565
Rym: I'm sorry.

139
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:37,227
Rym: I misspoke.

140
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:40,220
Rym: the anime industry is not conducive to existing anymore.

141
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:48,328
Rym: Anyway Friday 3 p.m.. To 4 p.m.. In workshop 1 Comics for the manga reader.

142
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,115
Scott: yeah, this is a panel I came up with.

143
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:52,168
Scott: I didn't plan it But we could just wing it.

144
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,942
Scott: we're at each in each convention We're doing.

145
00:07:53,962 --> 00:08:03,638
Scott: we're gonna wing one panel sort of and the basic idea this panel Is that a lot of the people at Otakon are gonna be people who like anime and people who like manga.

146
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:04,320
Scott: those are gonna be?

147
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,029
Scott: You know big interest for them.

148
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,863
Scott: I mean there are video game fans There.

149
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:15,478
Scott: you know all sorts of geeks there but mostly there's gonna be anime and manga geekdom even more anime than manga.

150
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:23,000
Scott: right and All these manga readers right obviously enjoy comics because manga is comics, and they enjoy manga.

151
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:24,565
Scott: There's a manga library there.

152
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,431
Scott: They'll be people in there reading manga.

153
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:27,936
Scott: They paid all this money to read manga.

154
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:28,979
Scott: They must like it.

155
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:36,740
Scott: But these people don't tend to read American comics and I've been American but non-japanese comics.

156
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,995
Scott: I partly understand any from any publisher.

157
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:44,559
Rym: because one You're not gonna find a lot of those really good French comics anywhere accessible or you'll know what they are.

158
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,300
Rym: Yeah, and if you go looking for American comics unless you know where to look you're gonna find mostly underwear perfect.

159
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,410
Scott: Yes, I mean you could pre-order with the crazy spreadsheet.

160
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,153
Scott: who's gonna do that?

161
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:56,236
Scott: who isn't on the inside?

162
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:57,782
Scott: you go to a comic-book Store.

163
00:08:57,983 --> 00:09:00,595
Scott: who's gonna do that or doesn't have body odor and a giant gut.

164
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:01,600
Rym: Oh, that's real harsh.

165
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:04,255
Rym: I know it's morning thing all right go to you go to a comic.

166
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:05,060
Rym: you go to borders.

167
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:06,607
Rym: Well, no the way you buy the manga.

168
00:09:06,627 --> 00:09:09,620
Rym: the problem is you go to a comic store, and it's mostly underwear perverts.

169
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:21,720
Scott: Yeah, you go to a borders where all the manga is and there is a shelf of you know non manga comics And it's so disorganized and difficult to figure out what's what and you don't even know what any things are.

170
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:27,500
Scott: More importantly it's all underwear pervert mostly, but you know more and more.

171
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:27,884
Scott: There's not.

172
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:30,624
Scott: this is not underwear perverts on there But not that much.

173
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:34,516
Scott: I would say about 25% at the average borders will be not underwear perverts.

174
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:35,620
Scott: That's a job space.

175
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:36,448
Rym: That's not enough.

176
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:37,659
Scott: It's not enough at all.

177
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:45,724
Scott: But 25% of the non manga graphic novel shelf space will be not underwear perverts on the average at the average borders I've been to.

178
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:50,119
Rym: yeah, yeah, the thing is even so a lot of it You can't tell unless you don't even know what it is.

179
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:58,604
Scott: So we're gonna tell at this panel Pete manga readers what non manga comics They would probably like.

180
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,129
Rym: I'm gonna spoil the panel right now.

181
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:08,799
Rym: Batman the Dark Knight Returns Watchmen V for Vendetta Scott Pilgrim Runaways Anything by Brian gave.

182
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:11,500
Rym: I think we're gonna do a whole aside.

183
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:14,409
Rym: I think we're gonna do an aside about alright.

184
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:15,332
Rym: There's also manga.

185
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:16,856
Rym: You should read that none of you probably have.

186
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,020
Scott: maybe we'll see.

187
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:23,060
Scott: Imagine I think over the way we'll tie it in is we'll say these are the great mangas this one.

188
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:24,460
Scott: We'll talk about that great manga.

189
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:30,720
Scott: Like if you like that great manga Then you'll like these great non manga and then picking and then we're done with that thread.

190
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:33,400
Scott: We'll pick another great manga and then continue.

191
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:37,172
Rym: But anyway, I don't want to get into this long discussion of all our panels now.

192
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:38,636
Scott: Friday 8 p.m.

193
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:44,194
Rym: To 9 p.m Panel 3 We're doing know your creators from Osamu Tezuka to Osamu Tezuka.

194
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:46,100
Rym: I don't think we need to say much more about that.

195
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:47,010
Rym: I think that'll be fine.

196
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,680
Scott: We're gonna tell people Pay-attention to who the hell makes your anime and your manga.

197
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,851
Scott: Yeah, because it's important the end Saturday morning 10 a.m.

198
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:54,573
Rym: To 11 a.m.

199
00:10:54,693 --> 00:11:07,603
Rym: In workshop - we are doing Advanced Wars because Otakon was desperate for panels and I happen to have suggested this as like a second string panel Earlier in the year and they basically came back before the con and said yeah Could you run that?

200
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:08,709
Rym: and I said, oh, yeah, sure.

201
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:09,895
Scott: I think we could do.

202
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:11,000
Scott: we didn't have a better suggestion.

203
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,984
Scott: They could have faked instead.

204
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:13,390
Rym: Well, we're already doing.

205
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:19,420
Rym: know your creators comics for the manga reader anime You should see and we could have done beyond D&D instead of Advanced Wars.

206
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,909
Rym: That's so less related to anime.

207
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,194
Scott: I know I know.

208
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:28,930
Rym: however, however I've been talking to them and there is a tiny chance.

209
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,880
Rym: We might run beyond D&D Saturday morning at some point.

210
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,980
Scott: Oh, yeah, because best panel we came up with this year.

211
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,818
Rym: Basically, the gist of all this is come to the GeekNights tables in the artist alley.

212
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:49,680
Rym: You will find us we have 11 of them and Over there, we'll have our schedule posted on our table and we might be doing extra panels all over the place.

213
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,704
Rym: So make sure you stop by.

214
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:54,839
Scott: Yeah, we all have a little stand-up schedule and we'll have a little stand-up something else.

215
00:11:55,482 --> 00:12:02,557
Rym: Yeah, Scott only said that because he knows that I happen to have bought two table tripods Yep, and of course on Sunday from 1 p.m.

216
00:12:02,577 --> 00:12:02,697
Rym: To 2 p.m.

217
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,969
Rym: Katsunori Matsushita will be talking about kendo the way of the sword and all I can say is that Katsu runs one fucking kendo panel.

218
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,980
Scott: Yeah, I mean I heard that the one from last Otakon was too epic.

219
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,731
Scott: The Katsu-Kan one was mildly epic.

220
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:17,876
Scott: It was a little smaller room.

221
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:18,800
Scott: I think it hindered him.

222
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,059
Rym: I think the small room is the only thing that held him back.

223
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:23,620
Scott: Yeah, but I think that the Otakon won.

224
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:30,940
Scott: I see no reason why it wouldn't be as epic as the last one Especially since Katsu will be very excited to hit Rym with a stick and Rym will be very unhappy.

225
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:33,980
Scott: Not that he gets hit with a stick which won't really hurt wearing armor.

226
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:40,310
Scott: But I will no longer be the undefeated honorable vice president To be in a really smelly sweaty armor.

227
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:41,995
Rym: Oh that armor is real smelly.

228
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:43,640
Scott: It's it's full of bo anyway.

229
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:51,420
Rym: Yep, and of course Saturday from 1 to 2 the Apple geeks panel and panel 2 with our good friends talking enough.

230
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:52,631
Rym: Oh, very nice very nice.

231
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:55,427
Scott: We'll probably be there I think panel at the same time don't we?

232
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,857
Rym: Saturday from 1 to 2 we most definitely don't.

233
00:12:58,018 --> 00:12:59,729
Rym: okay awesome I don't know where you got that.

234
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:01,080
Scott: there was something at the same time.

235
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,749
Rym: I forget whatever at the same time.

236
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:04,900
Scott: the Apple Geeks panel is better than anything at the same time.

237
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:09,418
Rym: Make sure you come by our table because we are going to be scheduling other things throughout the con.

238
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:13,299
Rym: for example We have our tradition of going to the ultra-violent movie.

239
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:18,195
Rym: If you I'm not gonna talk about it cuz we have to decide which ones we're going to.

240
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:21,289
Scott: but I want to go to that Bushido one and I want to go to machine girl.

241
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,857
Rym: I think I only want to go to machine girl.

242
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:30,139
Rym: That's fine I don't want to go to the other ones so much but basically we will be scheduling things that we are going to go to.

243
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,860
Rym: and If you're gonna be at Otakon check our schedule.

244
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:35,852
Rym: And if you want to be where the awesome is be where we're gonna be.

245
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:37,960
Scott: yeah on our little schedule probably have events.

246
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,171
Scott: We're running events our friends are running and then events.

247
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:43,419
Scott: We are attending so that you know where we're gonna be at.

248
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:52,951
Rym: Anyway, it is time for things of the day.

249
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:54,957
Rym: I've got something real light real quick.

250
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:55,920
Rym: I just thought this was cute.

251
00:13:56,481 --> 00:14:01,515
Rym: It's a comic by Sarah Mensinga called dragon girl, and it's really short.

252
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:02,598
Scott: It's a generic name.

253
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:03,380
Rym: there it is.

254
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:11,611
Rym: It's a really simple short comic, and it's just you know 20 or so Images accompanied by 20 or so paragraphs attacks, then isn't that's?

255
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:13,195
Scott: and that's not a comic.

256
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:14,539
Scott: That's more of a light novel.

257
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:18,594
Scott: Light novel yeah, incredibly light novel.

258
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,180
Rym: I would call it a comic.

259
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:22,493
Scott: It's not a comic if it's the art isn't sequential.

260
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:23,740
Rym: the art is sequential.

261
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:28,211
Rym: It just has a very long sequence.

262
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:30,138
Scott: Yeah, we'll see we'll see.

263
00:14:30,258 --> 00:14:30,780
Scott: anyway continue.

264
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:34,095
Rym: I don't see any reason why you wouldn't call this a comic if nothing else.

265
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:37,305
Rym: I'd call it a one-off webcomic Because it could be.

266
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:41,100
Scott: it's an illustrated work of prose as opposed to a comic which are two different things.

267
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,574
Scott: There's a line at which you go from illustrated book to comic.

268
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,480
Scott: There's there's a very distinct line there.

269
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,220
Rym: See I don't make the distinction at all and I couldn't care less.

270
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,899
Scott: There is there's a very very important artistic distinction that we won't get into now.

271
00:14:54,642 --> 00:14:57,190
Rym: Fine it is a rough illustration and text.

272
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,313
Rym: good God Scott.

273
00:14:58,775 --> 00:14:59,577
Scott: I know I didn't look at.

274
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:00,400
Scott: it might be a comic.

275
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:01,362
Rym: It's.

276
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:06,640
Rym: it's a really cute little story about a king and a little girl who is kidnapped by dragons.

277
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:08,400
Scott: Does the king have an awesome beard?

278
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,902
Rym: Actually, he does.

279
00:15:09,982 --> 00:15:10,886
Scott: I'm totally reading it.

280
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:11,668
Scott: He does.

281
00:15:11,688 --> 00:15:13,715
Scott: is this is the king awesome.

282
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:15,020
Rym: Uh no not really.

283
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:19,917
Rym: Basically all I'm gonna say is it's cute, and I really like the ending even though.

284
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:20,680
Rym: It's a little cliche.

285
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,704
Rym: I thought it was cute.

286
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:22,206
Scott: All right.

287
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:23,030
Scott: That's it.

288
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:23,953
Rym: Yeah.

289
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:27,929
Scott: Yeah, okay, so check this out I'm not sure, but I have.

290
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:30,359
Scott: basically this is a really quick thing of the day.

291
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:32,766
Scott: What fleshes it out as I have suspicions?

292
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:33,809
Scott: all it is.

293
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:35,213
Scott: the video is pretty simple.

294
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,500
Scott: some people at a Tokyo?

295
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,827
Scott: Convention Center are on an escalator.

296
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:43,840
Scott: so many people are on the escalator the escalator goes in reverse and they all fall off.

297
00:15:45,581 --> 00:15:46,243
Scott: Now that's it.

298
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:47,768
Rym: no no that's funny.

299
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:50,416
Scott: It is pretty funny, but here's the thing I have.

300
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:53,207
Scott: suspicions number one No the top.

301
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:58,915
Scott: well it could have been not the weight of the people But there were a lot of people on there, but someone flicking the switch.

302
00:15:59,257 --> 00:15:59,780
Scott: It's possible.

303
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,594
Scott: Another thing all the people on there are nerdy looking dudes.

304
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:05,638
Rym: You're thinking.

305
00:16:05,658 --> 00:16:06,340
Rym: It was not like comic.

306
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,466
Scott: I think this is a comic at situation.

307
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,770
Scott: That's my suspicion.

308
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:13,040
Scott: so someone watch this video and then confirm or deny.

309
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,727
Scott: Okay, that's all I got.

310
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:21,429
Scott: and you know watching people fall off an elevator elevator Elevate escalate it's an escalator.

311
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,420
Rym: Yeah, not too many people fall on elevators.

312
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:26,147
Scott: No It's pretty funny because you do.

313
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:29,456
Scott: the thing keeps coming down and the people keep spilling off of.

314
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:32,900
Scott: it causes like spill spill Spills bills, but it just doesn't stop.

315
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:34,495
Scott: It's pretty good.

316
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:40,340
Rym: You know I have a little bit more trouble laughing at own videos when it's not the person getting owns fault.

317
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:42,909
Scott: Yeah, but they're not owned too badly.

318
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,792
Scott: It's pretty much you.

319
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:44,294
Scott: I burped there.

320
00:16:44,455 --> 00:16:45,157
Rym: That was fantastic.

321
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:45,940
Scott: I know it's pretty much.

322
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,966
Rym: We're all about professional.

323
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:50,918
Scott: it's pretty much just fall off get up fall off get up fall off get up.

324
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,438
Scott: lots of screaming It's no one's really good.

325
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:54,928
Scott: No, one's really getting owned here.

326
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:56,435
Scott: It's just sort of like oh, no.

327
00:16:56,777 --> 00:17:03,669
Rym: Oh, no All right, okay, so I don't know how long we'll spend on this But we're gonna give you at least a brief overview.

328
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,982
Rym: slash counter part of ConnectiCon 2008 which we were at Already.

329
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:09,367
Scott: you want to do chronological.

330
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:09,749
Rym: What do you?

331
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:14,288
Scott: let's just do this chronologically all right, so we went there Late-ish Friday.

332
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:16,920
Rym: well they originally and I was gonna take work off.

333
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,925
Rym: I ended up not like all this business.

334
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:22,106
Rym: we ended up getting in you know late on Friday and Friday night.

335
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,200
Rym: the con was basically dead.

336
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,208
Scott: Yeah, I mean we got there.

337
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:27,773
Scott: There was nothing happening.

338
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:29,340
Scott: I couldn't tell if there are any events.

339
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:32,489
Scott: You know we discovered they had a new layout for the con.

340
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:33,973
Scott: everything was really sparse.

341
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,518
Scott: there weren't a lot of people.

342
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:37,063
Scott: there wasn't anything Happening.

343
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:37,926
Scott: you know we.

344
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:39,029
Scott: it was pretty.

345
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,394
Scott: it was really not.

346
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:41,237
Scott: it was very bad.

347
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,391
Scott: Basically, that's the only word I can come up with.

348
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:44,833
Rym: I mean just.

349
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:46,563
Scott: I tried to think of a nicer word But I couldn't.

350
00:17:46,885 --> 00:17:47,428
Rym: well it was just.

351
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:48,674
Rym: you know we show up in the world.

352
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:49,740
Rym: things kind of came together.

353
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,569
Rym: We got our badges we dealt with all that, but it was just.

354
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,055
Rym: there was really no one around.

355
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:54,040
Rym: there wasn't any energy.

356
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:02,884
Rym: Like there was a very small crowd of people kind of very morbidly and slowly and quietly and grumbly Wandering about and that was it.

357
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:06,317
Scott: Yeah, it was very Blair, and I wasn't getting a good feeling.

358
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:08,348
Scott: I had a pretty Pessimistic view.

359
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:15,038
Scott: as soon like we were there for maybe 15 minutes on Friday, and I was looking not forward to the Saturday and the Sunday.

360
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:16,744
Scott: I was like oh This is gonna be real bad.

361
00:18:17,046 --> 00:18:17,989
Scott: It's gonna be no good.

362
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,740
Scott: I can tell already I got bad vibes all over the place.

363
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:21,190
Scott: No good.

364
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:29,660
Rym: No good Yeah, so basically we just decided to go to our hotel You know how we're not here, and we left because we weren't actually supposed to show up till Saturday anyway.

365
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:31,720
Scott: Yeah, we didn't really do anything Friday.

366
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,205
Scott: We basically walked around real quick said hi to people got badges Didn't do so much.

367
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:38,386
Scott: Well.

368
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:39,332
Rym: We went to the hotel room.

369
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:40,257
Rym: We watched some Ava.

370
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:41,403
Scott: all right We watched that.

371
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:46,559
Scott: we watched Ava up from my iPhone to the TV pretty cool And I played a bunch of Civ 4 and we went to bed.

372
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:47,947
Scott: Here's a tip for people.

373
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:57,259
Scott: if you want to connect something to your hotel television It's all fancy, but the input button on the side You know cuz they always give you a weird remote and the weird remote doesn't give you the input buttons, right?

374
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:00,959
Scott: But there's an input button on the side of the television that doesn't seem to be working.

375
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,940
Scott: Disconnect the telephone cord from the television and now the input button will suddenly work Because it's no longer talking to the hotel system.

376
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,353
Scott: And then when you're done plug the phone cord back in and no one will say wary.

377
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:20,395
Rym: at some hotels that sets off an alarm And somehow it's all that you will not be able to turn off An alarm that says someone is stealing the television.

378
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:23,269
Scott: however at the hotel We were at it didn't do that so it was all good.

379
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,524
Rym: either that or no one was watching that alarm Which is fine?

380
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:30,140
Rym: Yeah, but but my one warning is that that alarm is not always silence.

381
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:31,826
Scott: Yeah, that's also true.

382
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:35,960
Scott: usually though a lot of times the alarm cord is a little different from the other ones.

383
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,742
Scott: It's a little more.

384
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:39,652
Scott: You know physically secured more thoroughly.

385
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,300
Scott: You know like have a big metal lock on it of some kind.

386
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:44,506
Scott: You know anyway Why would you do that?

387
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:47,560
Rym: because as long as the if as soon as it gets broken the alarm goes off and then you send?

388
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,186
Rym: Someone up to the room.

389
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:49,339
Rym: They can't get a TV out that quick.

390
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:53,600
Scott: Well the idea is that you know we slow them down and getting the TV out.

391
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,890
Scott: They lock not only that cable, but the other one.

392
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,040
Scott: so it's like if they break the alarm cable.

393
00:19:58,482 --> 00:19:59,870
Scott: You know that anyway forget it.

394
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:01,579
Scott: talk about Connecticut, okay?

395
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,157
Rym: Because I don't think you've seen these things so much before what they look like anyway.

396
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:05,760
Scott: I've seen a bunny.

397
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,745
Scott: I've been a lot of hotels.

398
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:09,076
Rym: have you now mr.. Hotel big shot.

399
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:13,069
Scott: Yes No, I've never been to hotels before Scott's.

400
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:15,294
Rym: he did now except for Connecticut.

401
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:16,117
Scott: right right.

402
00:20:16,137 --> 00:20:33,500
Rym: so Saturday morning We wake up early because we have the anime match game scheduled for two hours on Saturday morning from 8 a.m.. To 10 a.m.. Now the only Concern I had was that we had not yet met the people at the convention who were responsible for us being there.

403
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:40,900
Rym: We had figured out we had the match game because we got a schedule Went through it looking for names of events that we had submitted and assuming that they were ours.

404
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,031
Scott: Yeah, last year when we arrived at Connecticut.

405
00:20:43,071 --> 00:20:44,397
Scott: They had badges for us.

406
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:50,280
Scott: right well They had to make one for me But they had them and they had our names on a list to prove that we were actual guests.

407
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:56,913
Scott: They checked us out to make sure we were guests And then they had pre-printed itineraries telling us what to do.

408
00:20:57,796 --> 00:20:59,040
Scott: that was pretty cool this year.

409
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:05,108
Scott: We walked in and we said hey, we're GeekNights Basically and we had to make our own badges.

410
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:08,560
Rym: well basically the thing is what happened was we walk in we're like all right.

411
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,625
Rym: Hey, we're getting nice badges.

412
00:21:09,966 --> 00:21:12,919
Rym: and the funny thing is I see katsu's badge on the top of the stack.

413
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:18,317
Rym: Yep, it was like why does katsu have a badge, but the person who got him a badge doesn't have a badge.

414
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:25,073
Rym: luckily We didn't even have to argue or anything because the con chair Recognized us because we're at every freaking major con on the east.

415
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:25,917
Scott: was it the con chair?

416
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:26,560
Scott: is it someone else?

417
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,767
Rym: That was the con chair all right, so he's like.

418
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:34,898
Rym: Oh, yeah, you guys you recognize me actually and not Scott at first alrighty, and then he's like oh, okay, whatever.

419
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:42,927
Rym: and The point that basically the con chair asked us where the panels person was which we said Great, so you know we Saturday morning.

420
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:53,106
Rym: We go to our match game, and we're getting ready to go, and then we're thinking all right our Convention guests going to show up so we can run this or Not.

421
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:59,140
Scott: and well last year last year They didn't tell us whether or not we actually had guests, and we couldn't get a confirmation all day.

422
00:21:59,281 --> 00:22:03,945
Scott: But when we showed up to the panel guests appeared Miraculously awesome guests.

423
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:05,370
Rym: that was actually a really good match game.

424
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:14,834
Scott: the thing that really got me worried about this year was not just that They didn't tell us guests were coming or not But because it was 8 a.m.. Guests don't like to make up at him and to.

425
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:21,100
Scott: if I looked at the convention book There wasn't really people who were good guests for anime match games.

426
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,700
Rym: I was like even if they said guess who are they gonna say they were awesome guests.

427
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,638
Rym: I mean don't get me wrong actually a fan of some of these people But they are not going to be able to deal with the air.

428
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:33,491
Rym: well You know what they probably could have dealt with our anime match game.

429
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:39,210
Rym: just fine because after we had Peter Fernandez on and we kind Of rewrote everything we have two sets of questions.

430
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,660
Rym: the everyone is a hardcore anime fan.

431
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:44,800
Rym: Let's go set and the people kind of know anime.

432
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,980
Rym: Let's have generic magic game questions with an anime thing.

433
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:56,230
Scott: I definitely think that the that the only raid that the people kind of know anime match game works is If the people on the panel have enough star power.

434
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:04,177
Scott: if they weren't big star amazing people Then you really can only get by with the very knowledgeable match game or else.

435
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,120
Scott: It won't be entertaining.

436
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:10,676
Rym: So there's Scott and I are sitting in a room Basically alone and no one's in the panel.

437
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:15,813
Scott: so we're like alright People trickled into the con and people actually trickled into the room.

438
00:23:16,014 --> 00:23:18,329
Rym: yeah, but I'm saying at first no one was there And we're like awesome.

439
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:19,240
Rym: This is gonna be awesome.

440
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,558
Rym: You know people trickle in bit by bit.

441
00:23:21,204 --> 00:23:35,613
Rym: So we basically just start Talking to each other on stage and kind of talking to the audience a lot like GeekNights actually And we kind of just did GeekNights for about a half about 20 minutes or so Yeah, and the crowd kept growing and growing and the thing is no one left.

442
00:23:35,653 --> 00:23:39,620
Rym: in fact people kept coming in to see what was Going on and sitting down the crowds growing and growing.

443
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:47,618
Rym: We did an abbreviated version of know your creators because we weren't running it at the con And we didn't have the index cards because we weren't running it at the con.

444
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:49,000
Scott: actually I thought we were running at the con.

445
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:52,140
Scott: I forgot the index cards, but didn't matter because we weren't running it at the con.

446
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:55,740
Rym: Yes, so you know we do that and everyone loved it.

447
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,594
Rym: And then eventually there was a pretty large crowd in the room, and they're all being entertained.

448
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:04,974
Rym: so we stopped and said wait a minute You guys want us to just run the match game for you guys.

449
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:06,179
Rym: and the crowd was like oh my god.

450
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:13,619
Rym: And there are actually some people in the audience from last year who showed up only because they remembered How absolutely badass the match game was last yeah?

451
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:17,979
Scott: And the girl who bothered us all year and wanted a prize is actually not annoying.

452
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:19,648
Scott: She's just like I want my prize.

453
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:20,251
Scott: I'm like okay.

454
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,236
Scott: I brought some prizes here.

455
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:21,618
Scott: take them.

456
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:29,202
Rym: yep Sadly the t-shirts that we were also going to give here her are arriving a Friday morning at Otakon.

457
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:32,534
Rym: great, so I'm gonna mail her one as soon as we get back before packs.

458
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:35,205
Rym: okay, so if you're listening yes You're gonna get your t-shirt.

459
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:35,547
Rym: Yes.

460
00:24:35,587 --> 00:24:40,620
Rym: It's awesome alrighty, but so This actually started this one really well.

461
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,373
Rym: We got uncle yo up and I got to say uncle yo has gotten better and better.

462
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:51,313
Rym: at the anime comedy like every time I see him he's funnier on stage, and he's trying real hard.

463
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:53,180
Scott: I mean you know you got to give the guy some credit.

464
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:55,048
Scott: He tries he's putting everything.

465
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:57,780
Scott: He's got into that and he's you know he's improving himself.

466
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,059
Scott: Which is what you got to do?

467
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,640
Rym: I mean well one thing listen to the first few episodes of GeekNights say no more.

468
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:07,613
Rym: But I gotta say this as a match game guest.

469
00:25:07,894 --> 00:25:08,957
Rym: He was hilarious.

470
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:09,760
Rym: I kind of want him.

471
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:12,997
Rym: I always want him to be my ringer if we don't have enough guests.

472
00:25:13,037 --> 00:25:13,600
Rym: that was great.

473
00:25:14,022 --> 00:25:22,960
Scott: And the other thing is what I did is that when we were trying to select people for the game I actually sort of quiz the audience to get you know people who actually knew about anime.

474
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,228
Scott: I was like who knows what a road to katochi is?

475
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:28,300
Scott: and one guy said legend of the overfeed and I said who knows what?

476
00:25:28,747 --> 00:25:34,385
Scott: you know Itano circuses and one guy knew and I was like yes And the best part is we were.

477
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:37,717
Rym: I mean we figure with these game shows people might lie or something.

478
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:41,572
Rym: so at first we're like All right, if you lie and get yourself up here.

479
00:25:41,793 --> 00:25:43,540
Rym: You're only gonna make a fool out of yourself.

480
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:46,780
Scott: Yeah, but I also I asked questions, and I made sure the people answered them.

481
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,210
Rym: So there's no way that they were lying.

482
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:54,734
Scott: it was like it was trivia And it was hard anime trivia And I was very surprised that people in the audience actually knew like.

483
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:55,557
Scott: I'm surprised.

484
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:56,400
Scott: I got one person.

485
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:59,120
Scott: It was pretty good, and yeah They're great panelists.

486
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,092
Rym: It was funny because one of them I was like who is seen Gundam?

487
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:06,429
Rym: and everyone raised their hand and I was like double Oh 80 and all the hands of a two went down.

488
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,772
Rym: Yeah, but you know we get these people up and Running this match game.

489
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:11,720
Rym: Just kind of winging it.

490
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:18,008
Rym: It was real fun like everyone had a super good time and people kept coming in to the point that Just as the panel was ending the room was half full.

491
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:21,640
Scott: yeah, but not not super full like it was last year.

492
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,410
Scott: But that was because the guests, but here's the deal.

493
00:26:24,972 --> 00:26:27,280
Rym: this started a trend that kind of surprised me.

494
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:30,555
Rym: We're at ConnectiCon right which is not an anime con.

495
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:34,680
Rym: it is a geek Webcomic gaming anime con like all these rolled into one.

496
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,786
Scott: It's very in fact.

497
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:38,320
Scott: I'd say there's more web comics and gaming than anime.

498
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:42,857
Rym: I mean what anime stuff was happening at a con has better gaming than most gaming conventions.

499
00:26:42,898 --> 00:26:43,540
Rym: I've said that before.

500
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,606
Rym: I'll say it till I die.

501
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:44,887
Rym: Yeah.

502
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:45,148
Rym: Good.

503
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:47,320
Rym: God is the tabletop gaming at ConnectiCon vent.

504
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:48,965
Scott: Just cuz they have enough tables.

505
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,778
Scott: I mean ubercon didn't have enough tables at that hotel in Jersey.

506
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:57,012
Rym: the only thing They're lacking is Luke crane And I'm going to do everything within my power to get him.

507
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,525
Rym: he is going to PAX right yes And we'll all get to that a hundred percent.

508
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,110
Rym: Yes, all right in fact.

509
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,253
Rym: I've worked out to where he's.

510
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:07,205
Rym: he's going to be ready Hopefully I mean we got it.

511
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:15,175
Rym: unless something that comes up to run a burning wheel the sword or something demo Immediately following our beyond Dungeons and Dragons panel awesome.

512
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,320
Scott: is he gonna be on our panel though?

513
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:17,324
Rym: I'm not sure.

514
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:19,012
Rym: I think he might be in the audience.

515
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:20,900
Rym: my plan would be he could be in the audience.

516
00:27:21,202 --> 00:27:22,672
Rym: We do the panel cuz I think he'd really like.

517
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:25,660
Scott: oh, and then we and then we do that We praise him at during the panel.

518
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:33,986
Rym: I'll just because I want to I'd love to see him in person like sitting there in an audience where he is called by two Strangers a rock star.

519
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,651
Rym: yeah, I'd love to see that.

520
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:38,499
Rym: and then I'd love to be like ladies and gentlemen you're a rock star.

521
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:41,439
Rym: Let's say yeah, we'll see what happens.

522
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:56,073
Rym: But this trend that at every panel we ran, and I'm saying every single panel at ConnectiCon There were more hardcore knowledgeable awesome anime fans here than at any anime con we've ever been to that we did.

523
00:27:56,113 --> 00:28:00,687
Rym: panels at we at Katsucon were like How many of you have seen cowboy bebop?

524
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:04,420
Rym: and out of a hundred and twenty people like a third of them raised their hands?

525
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,867
Scott: It was pretty shameful.

526
00:28:05,928 --> 00:28:07,238
Scott: I was like oh my I was in pain.

527
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:10,020
Rym: We go we were here right at this panel.

528
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,986
Rym: I'm like you know.

529
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:11,630
Rym: here's some anime.

530
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,274
Rym: You should see you know.

531
00:28:12,294 --> 00:28:13,280
Rym: We're just talking in the beginning.

532
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:15,588
Rym: I'm like millennium actress blah.

533
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:22,370
Rym: I start naming Satoshi khan stuff and someone's like yeah, Satoshi khan I'm like wait How many of you have seen all of the Satoshi khan's movies?

534
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,000
Scott: and like everyone raised their hand and is the one girl like the?

535
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,936
Scott: Back left corner who had seen every anime in the known universe.

536
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:33,537
Rym: Oh god She was a little excited, but but it was great cuz she wasn't lying at the at the very end.

537
00:28:33,557 --> 00:28:41,754
Rym: you know at anime You should see which we did later We're like oh real quick And we're rattling off like obscure good anime or at least anime that you should probably watch.

538
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:50,478
Rym: and as soon as we started to say Jojo's Bizarre Adventure she ran up and showed us the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure PVC that she had just bought.

539
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:59,992
Rym: yeah But yes Every single panel we ran had hardcore Amazingly knowledgeable anime fans.

540
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:11,960
Scott: that was the hardest core match game We've ever run outside of the RIT anime club and by announcing what panel I mean at every panel We said these the panels are doing later these the panels are doing later, and it worked.

541
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:17,680
Scott: We saw the same people come to all these panels one after the other because they enjoyed our earlier panels so much.

542
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:21,480
Scott: I couldn't believe like it's never worked before, but it totally worked a hundred percent.

543
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:25,159
Rym: I don't want to sound like we're full of ourselves, but we were basically rock stars by the end of the con.

544
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:31,208
Scott: I know it was really weird the ConnectiCon size wise Smaller than a lot of other cons we'd go to.

545
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,940
Scott: you know smaller than Otakon smaller than KanzaCon by a lot, right?

546
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,111
Rym: You know I think it's actually now with our new no small cons policy the smallest convention We attend.

547
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:41,844
Scott: yeah But you know what?

548
00:29:42,185 --> 00:29:49,789
Scott: for some reason we had such a stronger and bigger connection with the fan base at Connecticut than we had at any con ever.

549
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,254
Rym: yeah, and it was.

550
00:29:51,335 --> 00:30:02,411
Rym: it was really cool like the audiences We're really into it And they seem to really enjoy it and it seems like audience members are going around like I saw people in the halls Telling other people to go to the rest of our panels, and they did.

551
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:06,962
Scott: but like you like every hallway I walked down every room I went into.

552
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:09,069
Scott: there were people that I had seen earlier in the day.

553
00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:10,735
Scott: there are people that I knew.

554
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:13,912
Scott: you know on some level They were and there were people.

555
00:30:13,993 --> 00:30:17,705
Scott: I saw them one day And then they played a game with them the next day And I'm like I remember you.

556
00:30:17,987 --> 00:30:18,369
Scott: in fact

557
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:33,502
Rym: out of all this there was a bunch of cool geeks we ended up playing a long game of power grid with on Sunday and a bunch of them played in like the burning wheel stuff and Now these people are cool enough to where they're probably going to be joining one of our burning wheel games like here in our real Lives.

558
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,268
Scott: yeah, I mean I played the sword.

559
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:44,833
Scott: I ran the sword for some people on Saturday night And then on Sunday we played this incredibly long game of power grid And one of the dudes who was in my sword was in the power grid.

560
00:30:44,853 --> 00:30:45,597
Scott: I was like I remember you.

561
00:30:45,617 --> 00:30:48,572
Rym: yeah So basically every panel we did.

562
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:53,573
Rym: so the next panel you know later in the day And they pretty much if you didn't get it at this point Friday was dead.

563
00:30:53,874 --> 00:30:55,400
Rym: Saturday was rocking in a big way.

564
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:57,108
Scott: No, we're super rocking.

565
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:58,498
Rym: Yeah, so we do.

566
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:04,470
Scott: I mean I don't know about the con itself, but as far as we were concerned the con was rocking Which is all I care about because that's what we promised.

567
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:09,198
Scott: we say if we go to a con No matter how much the con sucks we will rock and we fulfilled.

568
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:16,060
Rym: well We'll get to that because actually there were very few real complaints about the con as far as the con feedback session was concerned.

569
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:22,389
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, so next we did anime You should see and the fun thing was that panel.

570
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:29,300
Rym: that panel probably needed to be in main events because there was a line Like 20 minutes before filling the hallway.

571
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:32,206
Scott: I don't have a need to be in main events But it could have definitely been a panel one.

572
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:33,129
Scott: easily we.

573
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,020
Rym: the room was filled to the point that every single seat was taken.

574
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,408
Rym: Every possible space on the floor was filled.

575
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:41,300
Rym: there were people standing up like against all of the walls.

576
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:43,051
Rym: There are people standing in the doorway.

577
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:43,836
Rym: the door was open.

578
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:49,660
Rym: people were like Standing in the hallway with their heads in and there was a crowd outside being turned away for fire code.

579
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,123
Rym: You know what?

580
00:31:50,163 --> 00:31:51,251
Scott: I'm thinking we got to do.

581
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:52,640
Scott: Here's what I think with anime.

582
00:31:52,700 --> 00:32:03,533
Scott: You should see right on it twice and be no I can at Otakon and katsu con and cons that have a more this general Public audience do the anime that everyone should see at kinetic con.

583
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:05,720
Scott: We're obviously more people know what anime to see.

584
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:07,308
Scott: All we do is bring up.

585
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:08,614
Scott: These are obscure anime.

586
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:09,699
Scott: You should see we should do now.

587
00:32:09,981 --> 00:32:10,384
Rym: You know what?

588
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:12,580
Rym: We should be really for ConnectiCon because there are two audiences.

589
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,214
Rym: We do two panels and I don't know what to call them.

590
00:32:15,354 --> 00:32:16,460
Rym: one is the anime.

591
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:17,856
Rym: Everyone should see that.

592
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:20,731
Rym: You know all the like super big names that people might just not know.

593
00:32:20,811 --> 00:32:22,719
Rym: I know Ava ask a bebop all those things.

594
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:24,284
Rym: Then we do the other panel.

595
00:32:24,324 --> 00:32:28,617
Rym: That is all the like KO century beast Dominion tank police all that stuff people know.

596
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:29,319
Scott: tank police.

597
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:31,955
Rym: Well people at ConnectiCon no tank police.

598
00:32:31,995 --> 00:32:33,242
Rym: That's right God.

599
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:35,671
Rym: at the match game someone started singing it.

600
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:38,280
Rym: as soon as someone said Dominion tank police and that you know.

601
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:40,500
Scott: I'm gonna skip ahead to the con feedback session.

602
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:47,120
Scott: But you know the guy who was sort of the guy who ran the panels and events at ConnectiCon was sort of thrown into it the last minute.

603
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:54,014
Rym: Yes This is there were a lot of problems with panels at ConnectiCon but They really weren't the guy in charge of its fault because it was one of those.

604
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:56,871
Rym: Ah shit the cons fucked You fix it.

605
00:32:56,952 --> 00:32:58,163
Rym: and he said, ah crap Oh.

606
00:32:58,203 --> 00:33:02,931
Scott: and he did the you know As good a job as can be reasonably expected from someone in that position.

607
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:12,700
Scott: and I could tell from listening to him at the feedback Session which he had to handle on his own Right where last year at ConnectiCon the feedback session was handled by the you know, the entire head staff.

608
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:18,040
Scott: So the end he handled it real well And I could tell that he was the right person for the job and he knew his shit.

609
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Rym: Yeah, pretty much we're gonna be joining the staff along with him next year to handle panels.

610
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,328
Rym: No, yeah, so they can.

611
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:25,200
Rym: ConnectiCon is gonna be awesome.

612
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,919
Scott: But what he said at the you know feedback panel, which is something I think is very true for ConnectiCon is that?

613
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,327
Scott: Even though ConnectiCon is understaffed.

614
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:36,760
Scott: They know that right ConnectiCon has its problems and you know logistics.

615
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:37,526
Scott: We know that.

616
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:39,360
Scott: you know, there's all these things.

617
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:47,812
Scott: the people the members the people who come to ConnectiCon are really the people who make it happen and You get so only true.

618
00:33:47,932 --> 00:33:49,462
Scott: you look around the con It's not.

619
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:55,420
Scott: the staff aren't going around making big magic like happens and say Katsucon where they make huge magic.

620
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:56,243
Scott: You know this.

621
00:33:56,424 --> 00:34:00,880
Scott: the there aren't you know, there are big guests, but there aren't tons and tons of huge guests and amazed.

622
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:11,690
Scott: There's no industry presence at all Right, but awesome things are happening and it's all the people who came to the con making it awesome for each other Especially the thing that's so crazy about ConnectiCon.

623
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,978
Rym: I think I talked about this last year, but it always amazes me.

624
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:18,797
Rym: Every other con I go to Otakon Katsucon, even though his staff and an amazement.

625
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:23,969
Rym: and you know all these There were always like you needed crowd control everywhere.

626
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,580
Rym: You needed people like constantly keeping everyone in line and keeping everything organized.

627
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:34,777
Rym: Basically unless there was like something going on like an event you would really never see a ConnectiCon staffer.

628
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:38,382
Rym: and yet There were practically zero Problems.

629
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,835
Rym: there were like you didn't need people walking around yelling at people to move and get out of the way.

630
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:44,078
Rym: crowd control was it?

631
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,239
Rym: It's really amazes me that nothing goes crazy at ConnectiCon for how little security there is.

632
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,985
Rym: Yeah, and that says a lot about the people who can.

633
00:34:52,045 --> 00:35:03,513
Scott: I know they need a little help, you know Which I'll believe but you know what as Bad, you know, even though those things might not have been a hundred percent smooth.

634
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:07,545
Scott: They weren't completely Disastrous they they weren't.

635
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:08,870
Scott: they were you know, okay.

636
00:35:09,212 --> 00:35:10,135
Scott: It wasn't the end of the world.

637
00:35:10,436 --> 00:35:13,528
Rym: Yeah, but Anime, you should see that was like.

638
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:14,613
Rym: that was crazy.

639
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:16,000
Scott: Yeah, we didn't even say much.

640
00:35:16,121 --> 00:35:17,695
Scott: I don't remember what I said during that battle.

641
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:22,120
Rym: and then you know We did the skip a bit cuz I actually I really gotta start packing for Otakon.

642
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,000
Rym: Yeah, I'm still doing laundry here But you know then we did our how to run an anime club.

643
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,161
Rym: Which?

644
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:27,703
Rym: what do we say?

645
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:30,453
Rym: we we know how to run an anime club like perfectly.

646
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:36,370
Rym: we ran the biggest anime club in the country for a while and This panel is always like super good and the people there.

647
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,555
Rym: They thought this is intently.

648
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:41,420
Rym: they ask intelligent questions We give them the right answers and it's a fun panel to do.

649
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,891
Scott: I was kind of hoping we would get one of those questions.

650
00:35:43,932 --> 00:35:44,695
Scott: Like I'm a trucker.

651
00:35:44,715 --> 00:35:47,900
Scott: I want to run anime club But that was so awesome that guy wasn't there.

652
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,562
Rym: So I know.

653
00:35:48,943 --> 00:35:53,138
Scott: but then I'm always looking for that guy dressed up as the guy from Ranma who runs.

654
00:35:53,178 --> 00:35:53,700
Scott: what's his name?

655
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,888
Rym: Yeah, Oh Ryoga.

656
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:57,434
Rym: I thought you had the name of the trucker guy.

657
00:35:57,454 --> 00:35:58,820
Scott: No, the trucker was dressed as Ryoga.

658
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,571
Rym: Yeah, I know but I don't remember the truckers name.

659
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,100
Scott: No, I don't remember the truckers name either.

660
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:04,410
Rym: I find a trucker named Ryoga hilarious.

661
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:10,171
Scott: ConnectiCon trucker Ryoga If you if you listen to this email us geeknightsafrontrecruit.com.

662
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:11,234
Rym: Yes, so.

663
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:22,269
Rym: then we had our Headlining panel beyond Dungeons & Dragons the event that we were running at the penny arcade expo Which the only event we're running in the penny arcade expo.

664
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:33,248
Rym: also the one thing on the schedule most I mean most events We run at conventions are kind of like the show like they're organized and they're good, but they're kind of this back and forth They're kind of ad hoc.

665
00:36:33,268 --> 00:36:39,700
Rym: They're usually like they're really entertaining but they're Beyond Dungeons & Dragons is one of those rare ones kind of like the gecky guy panel.

666
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:50,480
Rym: We ran before where it's a we presented more like a serious lecture and it's a really like we actually put together a polished sort of like We model them as best we can after the TED talks.

667
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:53,391
Rym: We're just insane much because we can't really aspire to that level yet.

668
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:55,760
Scott: No, we're not, you know by that awesome.

669
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,779
Scott: We can't even go to TED let alone speak at it.

670
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,819
Scott: Yes, but you gotta be good enough to go before you good enough to talk.

671
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:15,864
Rym: but this was more like a lecture than a panel and The only thing I want to say is that when we arrived to do this panel And I saw that line going all the way down the freaking hallway for us and as we walked out people were going Oh my god, it's them.

672
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:17,149
Rym: Oh, man, this is gonna be awesome.

673
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,614
Rym: That really meant a lot to me.

674
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:20,060
Scott: Yeah, it was alright.

675
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:23,572
Rym: Well, I get a much bigger hard-on for attention than you.

676
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:24,013
Scott: Yeah.

677
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:25,258
Scott: I was just like what's up people's.

678
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,523
Scott: let's go you know, it's sort of like, you know, I guess that's it's one thing is I People?

679
00:37:30,604 --> 00:37:39,214
Scott: sometimes they have fans look at their fans like oh man, these people like me Oh man, but it's like I look at fans more is like a posse.

680
00:37:39,414 --> 00:37:40,417
Scott: It's like what's up guys.

681
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:41,300
Scott: Let's go rock the house.

682
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:41,925
Scott: It's not like.

683
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:43,436
Scott: oh, yeah, these people love me.

684
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:46,111
Scott: Oh my god I'm super famous and oh my god, it's like haha.

685
00:37:46,312 --> 00:37:47,056
Scott: What's up, dudes?

686
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:47,760
Scott: Let's rock.

687
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:50,275
Rym: But that panel was kind of awesome.

688
00:37:50,295 --> 00:37:55,891
Rym: And then of course Sunday, we got to watch a lot of people playing burning wheel.

689
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,200
Scott: I mean people are playing burning wheel all day Saturday.

690
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,444
Scott: I mean Alex.

691
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:01,547
Scott: he ran the sword.

692
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:03,293
Scott: I think what five or six times he's.

693
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:05,460
Rym: he ran it until he was sick of it.

694
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,000
Scott: He didn't run the lacuna But yeah He was complaining.

695
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:10,079
Scott: You know that he did.

696
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:18,931
Scott: Running the sword and not changing the scenario was getting a little boring to him and I could see that but he kept on doing It to see was basically selling a game.

697
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:20,800
Scott: That was someone else's game.

698
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:31,000
Scott: It's like if Rym wrote a book and I went around selling copies of it on my own time And he was doing it awesomely and he never had the same person play twice and he had at least three people in every game.

699
00:38:31,161 --> 00:38:36,300
Scott: So he introduced like 20 to 30 people to burning wheel and they all had an awesome time.

700
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,474
Scott: I ran the sword once, you know, and that was a little bit rough.

701
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:40,679
Scott: He ran it how many times?

702
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:45,920
Rym: One funny thing I noticed is that what we were doing this panel to you know, we're it was just a lecture.

703
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:51,146
Rym: you know anime cons like people always try to like say stuff to you or they raise their hand cuz they want to like interject something.

704
00:38:51,998 --> 00:39:02,680
Rym: and There were a lot of the people in the audience were very clearly hardcore Dungeons & Dragons fans and when we first started a lot like I saw a lot of people like raise their hands when we started talking about D&D and they're like

705
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:04,426
Scott: and

706
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:08,930
Rym: After another five or ten minutes, they all put their hands down.

707
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,280
Rym: I think by the end we converted almost everyone in that room.

708
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:12,484
Scott: Yeah, I know it was.

709
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:17,460
Scott: I was expecting there to be like outcries of you know, people saying ah D&D doesn't suck.

710
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:20,340
Scott: And we weren't really saying the D&D suck.

711
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:29,900
Scott: We were saying the D&D only plays this one kind of game which is crawl in the dungeon fight the monster Which is true and I was expecting you know, the typical fanboy outcry.

712
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:36,991
Scott: but I think we the way we presented ourselves really sent a clear message of This is us talking and you listening time.

713
00:39:37,413 --> 00:39:41,655
Scott: There's no talking during this panel and the questions at the end there were.

714
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:49,007
Scott: you know, I allowed time for like three quick questions or so and none of them really Confronted us in a negative way.

715
00:39:49,127 --> 00:39:52,800
Scott: even better and everyone was smiling and laughing and then cheering and excited.

716
00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:58,919
Rym: well, I think part of that was the That picture of the train that made sure the train works real well.

717
00:39:59,582 --> 00:40:01,391
Rym: That picture is just one of my favorite pictures.

718
00:40:01,672 --> 00:40:03,380
Scott: Anyway, it's a good picture.

719
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,480
Rym: It's one of those pictures where if there's a crowd of people you just have to show it to them and I'll start laughing.

720
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:10,399
Scott: Yeah, but I mean putting it in context is doubles the power.

721
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,308
Scott: That's that.

722
00:40:12,348 --> 00:40:12,673
Scott: love me.

723
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:20,216
Rym: That's one thing as much of a hardcore anime love and base.

724
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:21,239
Rym: there was a ConnectiCon.

725
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:26,513
Rym: Only like only two or three people in the audience got that joke until we explained it.

726
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:27,275
Scott: Yeah.

727
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:32,927
Scott: Well, that's a Dragon Warrior joke Dragon Warrior One and you had Dragon Quest.

728
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,673
Rym: Yeah, you had to get.

729
00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:36,860
Scott: we're talking about slimes and Drake ease.

730
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,071
Scott: It's something else right?

731
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:38,960
Scott: Dragon Quest, right?

732
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,023
Scott: They have rocket slime.

733
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:41,969
Scott: the Drake II gets no love.

734
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:44,337
Scott: the Drake II is far superior to the slime.

735
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:45,159
Scott: Where the fuck is it?

736
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,983
Scott: There's no Drake II game.

737
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:48,066
Scott: What the hell?

738
00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:49,631
Scott: I want Drake ease sure.

739
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:50,393
Rym: It's not Drake.

740
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:55,664
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's Drake II dr Iky At least in the translation.

741
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,230
Scott: Anyway, uh-huh.

742
00:40:57,511 --> 00:40:59,377
Scott: I believe anyway, they're so cute.

743
00:40:59,397 --> 00:41:01,363
Scott: They have to have a white the Smile.

744
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:03,671
Rym: I always felt bad about killing monsters in that game.

745
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:09,318
Scott: Well, not until later when they're horrible and disgusting but Early on it's slimes and Drake is yay.

746
00:41:10,562 --> 00:41:13,220
Rym: And of course we spent the rest of the con just hanging out with awesome people.

747
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:15,029
Rym: We met a ton of you.

748
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,140
Rym: everyone we talked to with this con was awesome.

749
00:41:17,402 --> 00:41:18,268
Scott: Yeah, there were no.

750
00:41:18,308 --> 00:41:24,337
Scott: like I usually had a con I always expect, you know, annoying fanboys to talk to me like hey Scott.

751
00:41:24,758 --> 00:41:25,784
Scott: I love your Hey, oh my god.

752
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,568
Scott: and There weren't any no smelly fan.

753
00:41:32,608 --> 00:41:34,977
Scott: They're probably there but they did not approach me.

754
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:37,004
Scott: They did not bother me I did not notice them.
