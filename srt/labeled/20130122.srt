1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,080
Scott:

2
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:13,623
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday January 22nd 2013.

3
00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:14,144
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:16,731
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:16,772 --> 00:00:17,253
Rym: We're back.

6
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:17,794
Rym: We're bad.

7
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:19,780
Rym: We're talking about Android netrunner.

8
00:00:22,382 --> 00:00:26,883
Rym: Let's do this Woman it's.

9
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:42,451
Rym: uh you know usually I'm the first one to make fun of people who actually say that it's cold outside because It's cold I mean if it's once it's close to zero degrees a real zero degrees the f-zero That's when I get a little bit.

10
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:43,619
Rym: It's a bit woman out.

11
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:55,238
Scott: According to NOAA it is yeah Negative seven Celsius, it's 20 Celsius 20 degrees Fahrenheit whatever it's cold.

12
00:00:57,523 --> 00:00:58,267
Rym: But yeah, we're back.

13
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:04,019
Rym: if you none of you've been paying attention We were out of town for our New Year's party, which was in town.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,263
Rym: We just didn't fucking do shows.

15
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:10,360
Rym: and then magfest mm-hmm, and then I went pretty much straight on to Istanbul mm-hmm.

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,534
Rym: And then I spent this last weekend skiing mm-hmm, and we're finally back.

17
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:15,940
Rym: I think you were sick for almost a day.

18
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:19,150
Scott: I was sick sort of yesterday and today ish.

19
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:21,437
Scott: I was like half sick, and I'm now.

20
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,705
Scott: I'm feeling actually pretty good Yeah, just feeling that.

21
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:27,339
Rym: but I realized we were talking about this just before we started doing the show.

22
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:34,918
Rym: Lot happened in the last few weeks, so we got a lot we could start with and we're gonna forget pretty much everything That we could talk about.

23
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:35,441
Scott: yeah it's like we.

24
00:01:35,702 --> 00:01:53,559
Scott: so many things happened between this episode and the previous episode that we could talk about and maybe one of those things will be in this opening bit, but Next episode the only things that we could think of for opening bits will thing or things that happened between this episode ending and The next episode.

25
00:01:54,222 --> 00:02:05,746
Scott: Which is really annoying because if we could figure out how to send our memories back in time before this episode And you think oh we got we could bring up like enough opening bits for half the year you'd think oh Just take notes or something.

26
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:06,167
Rym: you know what?

27
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:09,880
Rym: I have some notes that are written on the board next to the studio.

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,413
Rym: Do you know what I have written to X RFE?

29
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:13,197
Rym: and then two words?

30
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:13,820
Rym: I can't read.

31
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,854
Rym: I think one of them is oranges or dragons.

32
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:16,438
Rym: I can't tell.

33
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:20,150
Scott: And Luigi says go straight, it's gonna have.

34
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,535
Rym: I'm not even sure who wrote that.

35
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:22,880
Rym: I think it was nerd.

36
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:24,232
Scott: I think Luigi saw a ghost.

37
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:27,286
Rym: yeah Work emails like.

38
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:33,818
Rym: I don't know if that was a show idea, and then I wrote M show utana gig nights behind the scenes.

39
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:36,371
Rym: What Oh pro wrestling?

40
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:40,786
Rym: I guess we said we do that a long time ago, and Guys, and they're under we're grabbing each other.

41
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:43,096
Rym: We were gonna do a show on a hundred percenting a.

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,673
Scott: We've done that show I don't know.

43
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:47,580
Scott: it's not a bad.

44
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,240
Rym: You see why taking notes does not affect to actually help us.

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,085
Rym: It's not a bad show.

46
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:55,225
Rym: and despite all I mean I was in Istanbul for three days We had crazy crap happen.

47
00:02:55,847 --> 00:03:06,000
Rym: all I can think about right now is that I listened to Dave and Joel on the way to work Today and they watch not see you crisis, and they both simultaneously thought that the song sounded like Van Halen's jump.

48
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:08,958
Rym: And I listen to the song and it kind of does.

49
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:10,669
Scott: That's a listen to that song.

50
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,940
Rym: that's what's running through my head right now Makes me want to watch like bad 90s style anime all over again.

51
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:19,640
Rym: So yeah, what'd you do while I was in Istanbul?

52
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,707
Scott: That's a good question.

53
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:22,432
Scott: I went to work.

54
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:25,328
Scott: Yeah Played a lot of netrunner.

55
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:29,163
Scott: There's a runner meetup in fact Laid around.

56
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:29,785
Rym: well, I mean it's funny.

57
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:36,140
Rym: our friends Phil and she I mean we brought netrunner to magfest and then they well It's a two-player game, so they started playing.

58
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:37,622
Scott: Save it.

59
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:42,480
Rym: We'll save it, but yeah suffice it to say they took Scott's copy with them on trips around the world.

60
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:45,999
Scott: I watched a whole lot of Korean television shows.

61
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:48,550
Rym: I'm actually you know talking about stuff.

62
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,313
Rym: We've been watching lately.

63
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:50,337
Rym: I mean archer started up.

64
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:54,979
Rym: Which is good because Emily and I basically are trick hard in the netrunner box.

65
00:03:56,663 --> 00:04:04,835
Rym: Maybe you should look at it, so Emily and I burned through all of adventure time and this is a problem that spans all geekeries.

66
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:20,918
Rym: when you have something that's episodic Like maybe you're going through all the Megaman's or something or you're watching like all of a TV show that you never watched before You kind of get addicted to the fact that there's another one right there ready as soon as you're done like if you start playing Half-life 2. now it's like man.

67
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,120
Rym: I got all this half-life 2 and then I burned through episode 1 and episode 2. and then what do you mean?

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,950
Rym: There's no episode 3. what?

69
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:28,136
Rym: when's it coming out?

70
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:28,659
Scott: never?

71
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:41,150
Rym: So I watched the like four seasons of adventure time and it went from being a show I'd heard of to a show I liked to Second only to ponies in terms of current shows.

72
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,936
Rym: okay, really like that show.

73
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:46,387
Rym: It is a great show, but They're 15-minute episodes.

74
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:53,232
Rym: I watched so many I can hardly remember them and I hit the most recent one and now every day.

75
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,279
Rym: I look on pirate bay to see if there's another one.

76
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,412
Scott: Why don't you just look at Wikipedia to see what the TV schedule is?

77
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:02,202
Rym: I could I just don't because if it's on pirate bay I just click download Ponies.

78
00:05:02,263 --> 00:05:02,806
Scott: I check them.

79
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,600
Rym: well the thing is I've been why I've all right.

80
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,540
Rym: I never had a point where I could watch a whole bunch of pony in a row.

81
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:11,730
Rym: So I'm already in tune with the cycle of ponies.

82
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,640
Rym: I very recently hit the adventure time wall.

83
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,325
Rym: You should watch that show.

84
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:17,269
Rym: I'd like to do a show on it.

85
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,192
Rym: We could.

86
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:19,900
Scott: you know me shows are hard to watch.

87
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,445
Rym: Yeah, I know, but it's it's got.

88
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:23,673
Rym: I'm telling you I put it second to ponies.

89
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:34,093
Scott: see unlike you right I have chosen to watch running man, which has an episode Every single week no matter what of the year there is never there is.

90
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:37,237
Scott: since the show has started there has not been a Missed week.

91
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:41,151
Rym: It is a black and media.

92
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:42,980
Scott: the show is really long.

93
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,370
Scott: It's like at least an hour long each episode.

94
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:47,359
Rym: if I watch cowboy bebop again, right?

95
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,732
Rym: Eventually it ends like if they were just more episodes forever.

96
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:52,760
Rym: I would just be beyond that event horizon forever.

97
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,580
Rym: Yeah, if there is more if there was half-life 3 I just been forever.

98
00:05:56,162 --> 00:06:01,597
Rym: I just be in that event horizon forever, but those things all end and I can escape running man.

99
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:03,689
Rym: You can't get out There's no escape.

100
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,254
Rym: You're done.

101
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:08,780
Scott: Mm-hmm It'll and some of these shows do get cancelled and the ratings get bad.

102
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:11,014
Rym: But doesn't look like that'll happen to running man, right?

103
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:12,382
Scott: Well, not soon I mean there.

104
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:18,020
Scott: apparently there was a time when it may have been cancelled and the ratings are low But I guess they passed that and it's pretty popular.

105
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:19,487
Rym: Anyway, it's gaming day.

106
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:21,295
Rym: Skip all the anecdotes about shit.

107
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:24,444
Rym: I did in Istanbul and Mag Fest.

108
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:27,258
Rym: we barely talked about like the crazy crap that happened at Mag Fest.

109
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:27,599
Rym: Mm-hmm.

110
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,776
Rym: But so yeah speaking of sports and games the hockey's back.

111
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:37,478
Rym: Yeah, I Really wanted to boycott hockey cuz I'm kind of pissed about the whole, you know thing.

112
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:45,735
Rym: But I was at a kind of burger joint in Brooklyn Eating a burger and having some poutine and there was some hockey.

113
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:54,966
Rym: and there was hockey on an HD 16-inch screen like right in front of my face and I look up and I'm like, oh Right Hockey is the fucking bad.

114
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:55,729
Rym: It's hockey.

115
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:56,953
Rym: Oh my god.

116
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:58,337
Scott: Well, didn't you see that goal?

117
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,874
Scott: That was my thing of the day I think in last episode that was one of the better goals I've ever seen.

118
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:03,140
Rym: that's like top 10 or 15.

119
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,113
Rym: Yeah, but so I'm.

120
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:06,200
Rym: the hockey is there.

121
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,488
Rym: I'm watching the Rangers live at MSG right there from Brooklyn and then right then There's a face-off.

122
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:21,864
Rym: like two seconds after I start watching Gloves drop to fistfight and there's two guys in this joint who turn up and they're like, whoa Are those guys fighting?

123
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:23,490
Rym: Why aren't the ref stopping him?

124
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:24,574
Rym: So I turned.

125
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:27,660
Rym: I'm like so you realize in hockey There's rules about this sort of thing.

126
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,116
Rym: They're like there's rules about fighting and I explained to these guys how hockey works.

127
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:33,100
Scott: never seen hockey.

128
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:35,708
Scott: They just didn't really from Brooklyn.

129
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:36,491
Scott: I don't know.

130
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:37,655
Rym: it was just two dudes.

131
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:39,220
Rym: and meanwhile the owner comes out.

132
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,885
Rym: He's an LA guy.

133
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,397
Rym: He's like, yeah fucking break his nose.

134
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:44,154
Scott: Yeah LA just won the cups.

135
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:44,780
Scott: He's excited.

136
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:50,095
Rym: So the fight ends and one guy's got a clearly broken nose that he's hiding.

137
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:53,003
Rym: so we won't have to leave the game And everything's cool.

138
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:54,909
Rym: next face-off another fight.

139
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:59,002
Rym: Yeah, I think those are the first two hockey fights of 2013 Huh?

140
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:01,732
Scott: I mean, I'm sure that wasn't the first game of the day.

141
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:03,860
Rym: I think they were the first proper.

142
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,540
Rym: I mean, you know sometimes fights just kind of start.

143
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,675
Rym: Those are the first like two guys at the face-off give each other the look of.

144
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:11,966
Rym: as soon as that puck drops Let's drop our gloves.

145
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:14,419
Rym: Anyway, those are my favorite kind of hockey fights.

146
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:15,926
Rym: No second favorite.

147
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:17,756
Rym: My favorite is when the goalies get involved.

148
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:20,790
Rym: exciting You got any news?

149
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:21,355
Scott: I do so.

150
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:31,320
Scott: Kotaku posted this article top five or so board games to get excited about in 2013 And normally this kind of thing is one of those link bait top whatever list.

151
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:39,876
Rym: Yeah it's also really hard for me to get excited about new games because I mean every board game that comes out is Going up against Puerto Rico teeny

152
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:50,551
Scott: But anyway, so I looked at this list and you know It actually was kind of handy because usually I don't pay shit attention to what games are coming out Later, I pay attention to board games after they come out.

153
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:53,844
Scott: I see that they're starting to get hot and then I get grab Yeah, it's like oh what.

154
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:54,910
Scott: after like a month or two?

155
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,035
Rym: I'll be like, what's this game?

156
00:08:56,075 --> 00:09:02,077
Scott: and some dude who knows Huh, a lot of people are talking about and playing this game.

157
00:09:02,197 --> 00:09:05,132
Scott: or wow I see this game at every retailer and every convention.

158
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:06,379
Scott: I wonder what the deal is granted.

159
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:12,648
Scott: Oh this game shot all the way up to the top of the board game geek list That I saw before.

160
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:16,240
Rym: it was out that I was really intrigued about was castellan, but I don't think it's out yet.

161
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:17,886
Scott: Yes, I'm gonna look for that though.

162
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:18,971
Scott: So here's the games.

163
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,136
Scott: they talk about the cave.

164
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:30,880
Scott: based on their description the cave looks like Infiltration but you're discovering a caves as different paths is branching Right.

165
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:47,680
Scott: Uh Space cadets seems to be a lot like space team or you know Artemis bridge simulator where everyone has a different board and does things on their board and it affects the Universal board and everyone else is bored, right?

166
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,527
Scott: Kemet seems to be relate.

167
00:09:51,567 --> 00:10:05,840
Scott: I guess they say that it's a successor to a different game called cyclades Cyclades, I guess it looks like Greek gods fighting or something or Seen that somewhere auctions to appeal to the different Greek gods.

168
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,824
Scott: I don't know like.

169
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:10,136
Rym: I've seen that in a board game library and for some reason ignored it.

170
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:15,078
Scott: roll for the galaxy Which I guess is race for the galaxy X couriers, which?

171
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:29,464
Scott: Race for the galaxy is okay couriers is me So combining them, you know, whatever the one that's really interesting here that I think I'll buy no matter what is called Tammany Hall.

172
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:33,480
Scott: and yes, the theme is part of the reason part of the reason I'm buying this.

173
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:41,993
Scott: So apparently Tammany Hall was the game that was released a while ago in oh seven But only printed 500 copies and that was it period.

174
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:42,836
Scott: so but it got.

175
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,020
Scott: people liked it a lot.

176
00:10:45,345 --> 00:11:03,255
Scott: on the theme alone This appears to be an el grande of downtown New York broke it into areas and you put Italians Irish Germans and different races of New York City immigrants into the different neighbor.

177
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:07,836
Rym: It sounds like a perverse Zularato, it's like get a red.

178
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:16,525
Rym: Oh, yeah You know if ever a game was gonna be sold to me on theme alone and also has a little bit of die marker I guess cuz it's political.

179
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:26,350
Rym: the only game that's grabbed me on theme alone before this I think was Not glory to Rome but the goth game gluttony in whatever Rome.

180
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:32,990
Rym: yeah, whatever that was called that game actually sucked but It was actually fun the first time.

181
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,060
Scott: the second time I realized second time We saw it was going on and how most of the cards were just new.

182
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:42,378
Scott: Yeah, if you could if you made a better deck of cards that game could be good.

183
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:44,979
Scott: Anyway, we did an episode on that.

184
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:47,947
Scott: Oh, there was actually I completely forgot about it.

185
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,855
Scott: There is actually a more important news.

186
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:51,998
Scott: It's recording, right?

187
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:56,180
Scott: Yeah Yeah, why would it not be because we stopped and started again?

188
00:11:56,701 --> 00:12:01,437
Scott: There is a more important news that I forgot back the veil that I forgot and remembered.

189
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:02,420
Scott: Are you ready for this news?

190
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,905
Scott: It's actually a big news.

191
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:08,460
Scott: some you know how we always complain companies don't do smart shit and we're like company.

192
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:10,269
Scott: Why don't you just do smart shit?

193
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:10,893
Scott: Fuck you?

194
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:11,737
Scott: Fuck you do it.

195
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:16,194
Scott: Come on What if I told you a company did a smart shit?

196
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:17,700
Scott: the smartest shit?

197
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,530
Rym: Is it a company that is not valve or Google?

198
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:21,433
Scott: it is.

199
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:23,340
Scott: it is a company that is not.

200
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:30,898
Scott: in fact Hasbro subsidiary wizards of the coast wizards of the coast.

201
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,133
Scott: Yes So you could also in fact truthfully say Hasbro has done a smart current.

202
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:43,596
Scott: stewards of fuck out of them stewards of Dungeons and dragons and guard the kind and more duck magic the guy that ain't.

203
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:57,016
Scott: if you go to the website www.letter D letter N letter D classics.com This website will sell to you for American dollars.

204
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:58,400
Scott: Shut up and take my money.

205
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:08,998
Scott: every D&D book ever in a DR apparently DRM free PDF you can just buy.

206
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:10,969
Scott: look here It is D&D something.

207
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,800
Scott: I just bought on eBay made out of paper.

208
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:16,779
Scott: D&D classic, you know basic set rule book by.

209
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:23,800
Rym: So when you say every are we talking like all the original individual things plus like the cyclopedia edition.

210
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,703
Rym: Is this everything?

211
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:34,039
Rym: everything name a book the Dungeons and Dragons rules cyclopedia rules Cyclopedia because that is the original D&D that I knew.

212
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:38,352
Scott: Hold on I think I typed it wrong.

213
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:40,944
Rym: It might have the AE Diphthong in there.

214
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:42,931
Scott: Yeah, I don't think I'm spelling it wrong.

215
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:48,296
Rym: See why CLO P a DIA search engine is slow.

216
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,865
Scott: great It's pretty slow.

217
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:53,356
Rym: doobie doobie doo doobie doo doo.

218
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,808
Scott: Their website is not the greatest.

219
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:56,491
Rym: All right.

220
00:13:56,692 --> 00:14:02,663
Rym: All right, I'll figure out if they Rules compendium three and a half Three and a half.

221
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:03,285
Scott: Hold on.

222
00:14:03,486 --> 00:14:05,011
Scott: They still they got all the additions.

223
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:06,435
Scott: one, two, three, I think.

224
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:07,178
Rym: wait one.

225
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:07,619
Rym: That's a D&D.

226
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,048
Rym: What about regular D&D?

227
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,773
Scott: Yeah, they have.

228
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:12,794
Scott: they have all the D and D's.

229
00:14:14,242 --> 00:14:17,474
Rym: Do they specifically have the rules cyclopedia, which is correct slightly.

230
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:19,039
Scott: So I'm looking.

231
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,205
Scott: it's Cyclo.

232
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,613
Scott: Hey, dear God, do I have to do?

233
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:24,740
Rym: I have to use Google myself?

234
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,402
Rym: CYCL o it's like encyclopedia without the end.

235
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:35,188
Scott: It's not a good book though.

236
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,070
Scott: That is no it's not.

237
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,410
Scott: everybody I have talked to says you should use in fact this other book.

238
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:45,590
Scott: That is the number one best-selling book on here the D&D basic set rule book.

239
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,238
Rym: Okay Tell me what the differences are and maybe I will trust you.

240
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,061
Scott: somebody.

241
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:51,725
Scott: Luke Crane says so.

242
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:52,587
Scott: he plays.

243
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:54,273
Scott: he's played these game Recently.

244
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,141
Rym: ask Luke Crane what the difference is.

245
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:56,865
Rym: Okay.

246
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:59,494
Scott: But anyway They have.

247
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:03,030
Scott: they sell you here D&D basic set rule book five dollars.

248
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:05,040
Scott: They give you a watermarked PDF.

249
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:11,349
Scott: as the PDF doesn't seem to have DRM It just has some sort of watermark on it by mold vay or mensa or whatever it is.

250
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,959
Scott: I forget which one was the guy who wrote which one.

251
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:16,570
Rym: all right doesn't have the second edition psionics handbook.

252
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:18,100
Scott: All right psionics.

253
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:19,490
Scott: The search engine is really slow.

254
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:25,596
Rym: Yeah Cuz the Cyclopedia is the oldest D&D book I have right expanded sound exam book.

255
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:29,270
Scott: three and a half and HR for a mighty fortress wait three and a half.

256
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:30,988
Rym: No, I need the a D&D one.

257
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:33,215
Scott: Well this second edition.

258
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:35,021
Scott: Let's see edition second edition.

259
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:37,910
Scott: Let me try browsing for it because their search engine is awful.

260
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:42,040
Rym: Oh so far that the books I'm most interested in or not in here.

261
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:44,166
Scott: This site is so slow.

262
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:49,590
Scott: Oh my god Oh my god, but supposedly this has all the books.

263
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:53,509
Rym: We'll do a follow-up review of this thing as I see if the books that matter in there or not.

264
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:56,630
Scott: But at least on paper This is kind of awesome.

265
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,348
Scott: right?

266
00:15:57,851 --> 00:15:59,576
Scott: because now you don't you know the rules?

267
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:07,349
Rym: Cyclopedia contains all major rules compiled and revised from the dungeons and dragons basic rules as Well as the expert rules companion rules and master rules box sets.

268
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:14,094
Scott: Yes, suppose like on in theory the Cyclopedia is just supposed to be BECM all in one book.

269
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:17,383
Scott: right but apparently there are things that are different right.

270
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:21,540
Scott: Luke Crane told me whoever told you to get the Rules Cyclopedia was wrong.

271
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:24,678
Rym: He told me those words, okay I just want to find out what the difference is.

272
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:24,960
Rym: the rules.

273
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,989
Rym: Cyclopedia has extra optional things in it.

274
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:30,649
Scott: No, he said that there were in fact Changes in it that were bad.

275
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:33,474
Rym: I'm dubious.

276
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:36,408
Rym: I trust the man, but I'm dubious of this second gen.

277
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:47,000
Rym: hearsay Okay, anyway, but anyway things of the day.

278
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:58,720
Rym: so Technology when it comes to audio has actually been progressing pretty rapidly for the last decade Despite you know people might not realize this because music seems so ubiquitous.

279
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:10,819
Rym: Audio seems so kind of standard like people don't think what is improving in audio but when you think about like autotune as We know it today is a relatively modern invention and the old ways to do it like vocoders and things.

280
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:13,491
Rym: We're a lot more manual like automatic shit.

281
00:17:13,511 --> 00:17:14,756
Rym: Just kind of works in audio.

282
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:20,027
Rym: now, so There's some people and this was on Boing Boing So I'm gonna link to two of these.

283
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:23,020
Rym: it's the same people as far as I can tell who did these two videos.

284
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:37,636
Rym: they took Rym's losing my religion and Metallica's nothing else matters and all they did was transform every minor third into a major third to make the song be in a major key and I think it sounds great.

285
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:39,145
Rym: It's.

286
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,700
Rym: it's interesting to listen to though.

287
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:55,680
Rym: If you read the comments a lot of people claimed that it made them feel sick Listening to it But most of those people also admitted that they were big fans of you know Either Metallica or Rym and had listened to the song so many times that like it bothered them that it sounded different.

288
00:17:56,381 --> 00:18:04,300
Rym: What's funny is a lot of people seem mad that they were doing this Like actually angry that someone was taking these old songs and doing something cool with them.

289
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:07,532
Scott: I don't understand why people can't angry about shit like it's like.

290
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:08,937
Scott: would you repaint the Mona Lisa?

291
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:10,500
Scott: I'm like, yeah sure Yeah, why not?

292
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,942
Scott: Original.

293
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:16,446
Scott: it's not like if someone fucked up the original Mona Lisa and painted on it I would like shoot.

294
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:18,480
Scott: that'd be like what the fuck is wrong with these guys.

295
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,562
Scott: But if some guy stands next to the Mona Lisa and paints a new one Who?

296
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:25,074
Rym: and it was a funny little Charlie Chaplin mustache on it.

297
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:26,300
Rym: I mean who cares?

298
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:39,380
Rym: but what's cool is the Metallica one is from about a year ago and the losing my religion one is from very recently and Even now the difference in a year's technology is like night and day in terms of how well it's done.

299
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:54,859
Rym: So I urge you to listen to these and it's interesting that one losing my religion Like if you don't think about like chords and intervals and things I mean back in the day the church would write at length about the effects of different chords and different intervals on the human psyche.

300
00:18:54,879 --> 00:19:11,920
Rym: and listening to the song in a major key has a very different feeling from listening to it in a minor key to the point that the It's like the underlying maths of the music itself Independent of the lyrics has an equally profound effect on the way you feel the music to the actual words in the song.

301
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:13,205
Scott: But is it?

302
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:23,326
Scott: you know, but the thing is it's like we you know, the rules of music It's like there are no like the rules of music are not an inherent thing of the universe like Inherent thing of the human brain exactly.

303
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:26,415
Rym: Well, we know I got to qualify that a little bit.

304
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:32,500
Rym: They are based on Certain things where like there are the ideas of harmonics, right?

305
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,150
Scott: But the point is is that all it is is there are sounds.

306
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:48,272
Scott: we can only hear this frequency through that frequency Right, and we tested over centuries how people feel when different sounds different frequencies are heard And then we categorize them, right?

307
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:53,860
Scott: So it's like oh my god Minor makes you feel this way to major makes you feel that way.

308
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,720
Scott: Well, it's like yeah because we just we group those sounds together because they made you feel that way.

309
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,004
Scott: We said let's take all the sounds that make you feel this way and call those the minor and You feel this way.

310
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:07,593
Rym: We'll call those major not quite because what minor and made.

311
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:13,720
Rym: it's just the difference between one specific interval That's defined by a frequency difference between two pitches, right?

312
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,260
Scott: But it's like they group, you know, it was Named it the minor as opposed to the major, right?

313
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:31,320
Scott: But the point is they came up with that system based on you know They categorize them in you know Realized that made a difference in feeling and that is why there is even any, you know definition there at all any categorization.

314
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:39,733
Rym: Well, my point is just that listening to a song that you know, very well that it's not a cover It's not like someone covered it and sang it in a different key, which is pretty easy to do.

315
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:45,532
Rym: This is the exact original Identical in every way except it's in a major key.

316
00:20:45,572 --> 00:20:46,335
Rym: It's uncanny.

317
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,380
Scott: That's what keys are.

318
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:52,080
Scott: Be like, you know, we define foods by the way, they taste to us.

319
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,166
Scott: We put this food here.

320
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:55,056
Scott: We call it salty because it's all actually.

321
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:59,780
Rym: no we defined We define that because we can only taste four things right and we put this food over there.

322
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,211
Scott: We call it bitter because it's bitter because we can only.

323
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:02,873
Scott: oh my god.

324
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:03,496
Scott: I changed.

325
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:10,975
Scott: I took this food That's usually a salty food the potato chip and I took out the salt and I replaced it with bitterness and oh my god It is bitter now.

326
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,288
Scott: Okay, I changed it.

327
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:13,851
Scott: I changed now.

328
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:14,897
Scott: It's a bitter potato chip.

329
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:21,780
Rym: Holy shit All I'm saying is these are really cool and the technology to do this autumn fairly automatically is relatively recent.

330
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,443
Scott: That is.

331
00:21:22,463 --> 00:21:26,320
Scott: the interesting part is that usually if you wanted to have a song in a different key.

332
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:39,687
Rym: you would have to read, you know, re-score and re-perform the song or Be basically sit and master the entire thing kind of by hand which we change the frequencies it or use a really harsh Automated system.

333
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:43,746
Rym: that usually were really bad like old vocoders Kind of sound like shit.

334
00:21:43,827 --> 00:21:51,340
Rym: one of the reasons why you have those sort of synthetic voices and a lot of old You know early days of electronica music is because you couldn't make it sound natural.

335
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:54,380
Rym: So instead we went the other direction made it sound cool, but not now.

336
00:21:54,582 --> 00:22:06,660
Scott: It would also be much easier to do this If you had the original Recordings of all the separate tracks so that we could like take the guitar and change it and take the singing and change it Whereas if you know to change it when they're all already mixed together is much more difficult.

337
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:15,900
Scott: So the fact that technology can now do this when they are mixed together, you know It probably does like an FFT to separate everything out then change it and mix it back together again.

338
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:17,639
Rym: Yeah, it's actually probably a little more subtle.

339
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,248
Rym: Do you know what FFT stands for the fast Fourier transform?

340
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:27,979
Scott: actually because that keeps coming up all the time and is a programming thing I've actually done Some research on what that's about.

341
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:37,018
Rym: Yeah, I actually use those in the the mag fest videos that I uploaded to remove a couple of specific actually use notch filters And other things too.

342
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:43,987
Rym: There were some hisses and some weird like background noise from the con that I had to kind of edit out because some of the panelists Were way fucking quiet.

343
00:22:44,168 --> 00:22:44,349
Scott: Mm-hmm.

344
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:46,480
Scott: Anyway, anyway thing of the day.

345
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:51,346
Scott: So this guy I guess he has a chicken in his yard or something All right chicken in the yard.

346
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:54,499
Scott: But anyway, the chicken lays fucking eggs cuz that's what it does.

347
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,869
Scott: And one of the eggs it laid was huge.

348
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:05,984
Scott: Like we're talking way bigger than the chicken no, but like Really big.

349
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:09,260
Scott: you can see it in this video how big the egg is, right?

350
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:13,740
Scott: It's like if it was around it might be a tennis ball.

351
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:16,443
Scott: It's a big egg And he's.

352
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:20,180
Scott: he gets his video and he's like check out this egg and compares it to a grocery store egg.

353
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,084
Scott: It's like look how big it is.

354
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:28,833
Scott: Oh my god, and then he cracks it open over the stove To show, you know over a pan on the stove to show you.

355
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,944
Scott: because and he's like, all right We're gonna see what's in here.

356
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:31,928
Scott: everybody on video.

357
00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:34,840
Scott: We're gonna see what's in here and watch the video and see what's in there.

358
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:37,150
Scott: It's not what you expect to be in there.

359
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:41,959
Scott: I Mean, you know, I was expecting, you know a chicken of some kind.

360
00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:45,980
Scott: No, there was not a chicken in there it was so it was something else.

361
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:49,617
Rym: So was it that some other animal laid an egg under the chicken?

362
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,762
Rym: Nope All right.

363
00:23:51,823 --> 00:23:52,747
Rym: I have not watched this video.

364
00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:53,229
Rym: I don't know.

365
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:55,420
Scott: I know you're gonna watch it and find out.

366
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:55,943
Rym: I'll watch it.

367
00:23:56,406 --> 00:24:02,732
Rym: Yeah, so in the meta moment the book club book Which I'll finally add to the website is F Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.

368
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:03,935
Scott: It's actually.

369
00:24:03,955 --> 00:24:05,760
Scott: I read it completely.

370
00:24:06,162 --> 00:24:07,108
Scott: It's actually way short.

371
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:08,999
Rym: I'll read it relatively soon.

372
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:12,460
Scott: I did not realize how short it was because I had a digital edition of it.

373
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:13,470
Rym: Yeah, you guys just don't know.

374
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,569
Scott: you look at those percentages you don't have and then you don't know how long it is.

375
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:21,332
Scott: unless you either check to see how many pages or Start reading and you see how much the percentage goes up.

376
00:24:21,513 --> 00:24:22,819
Scott: Yeah, it's like at the end of chapter one.

377
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,389
Scott: I'm like six percent.

378
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:26,019
Scott: This is gonna be short.

379
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:29,344
Rym: We were just at magfest.

380
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:32,172
Rym: I've uploaded two of our panels and lectures.

381
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:33,978
Rym: I've uploaded beyond candy land to YouTube.

382
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:34,520
Rym: you can watch it.

383
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:36,345
Rym: I've also uploaded one of the panels.

384
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:50,320
Rym: we were on video game genres and I'm thinking about submitting that same topic to PAX dev But assembling a an expert group of panelists for it And I've already sent some emails to people because I think it'd be a good topic actually for dev with a with like people who?

385
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,480
Rym: Are prepared and have specific things to say already?

386
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:53,793
Rym: We'll see.

387
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:55,738
Rym: It's my crab people.

388
00:24:56,643 --> 00:24:58,851
Scott: The next thing she's coming out PAX East.

389
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:00,055
Scott: I'm enforcing.

390
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:01,500
Rym: Yeah, I submitted to enforce.

391
00:25:01,842 --> 00:25:04,480
Scott: They're looking for more enforcers so you can join our club.

392
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:05,800
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

393
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,329
Rym: I did not.

394
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:11,463
Rym: I you know I will do whatever they ask me but I'm actually not going for like panels or the things you guys know I'd be good at.

395
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:13,050
Rym: I'm going for like something crazy.

396
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:13,673
Rym: I've never done.

397
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:15,040
Scott: I'm just going for whatever.

398
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,625
Scott: I don't really give a shit.

399
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:21,600
Scott: I'm going for like back-end operations or something I mostly just don't want to have to do something where I sit in one place for a long time.

400
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,620
Rym: That's why I want to do back end like like haul something around.

401
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:33,609
Scott: I don't really want to do like, you know stand and check badges or Sit at the tabletop library and check games in and out.

402
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:41,003
Scott: I want to do something like stand there and help people or You know walk around doing work Whatever.

403
00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:41,566
Scott: We'll see.

404
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:42,169
Rym: it should be fun.

405
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:46,475
Rym: We should also be doing one or two panels I sent in our GeekNights workshop.

406
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:50,431
Rym: like we always do Might do something a little bit different if they give us a room for that thing again.

407
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:52,400
Rym: Hmm probably involving power grid.

408
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:54,606
Rym: After that ConnectiCon.

409
00:25:54,646 --> 00:25:55,470
Rym: submissions are open.

410
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,153
Rym: submit your panels.

411
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:58,405
Rym: We're gonna start scheduling in a few weeks Mm-hmm.

412
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:03,189
Rym: You can keep submitting after that but Prime spots will slowly disappear for his dibs.

413
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,480
Rym: Yeah dibs dibs Jerry the dibs.

414
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:09,088
Scott: We're gonna go to Pax Australia man.

415
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:10,252
Scott: Things are just coming up fast.

416
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:22,044
Rym: We've got to start looking for that I know and of course if you want us to speed up our utenna show or radio free equestria or any of these other videos Spread them around.

417
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:23,389
Rym: the view counts have to go way up.

418
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:26,462
Rym: where I'm gonna take my sweet fucking time and uploading these things Mm-hmm.

419
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:30,000
Rym: I like doing them, but that means I'm gonna do them at the rate that I want to do them.

420
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,863
Rym: We're not gonna force it.

421
00:26:30,903 --> 00:26:37,566
Rym: But if you get if radio free equestria gets like 10,000 views in the next couple weeks We'll put out one every week or so.

422
00:26:37,586 --> 00:26:39,452
Rym: I mean, I'll do whatever if you guys start watching them.

423
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:42,360
Scott: Anyway, so Android netrunner.

424
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:43,026
Scott: Here's the deal.

425
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:44,700
Rym: I keep wanting to call it an Android.

426
00:26:45,882 --> 00:26:46,626
Scott: So here's the deal.

427
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,180
Scott: right for people who don't know this needs some explanation.

428
00:26:50,021 --> 00:26:51,728
Scott: Back in the day when magic came out.

429
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:54,760
Scott: There was another CCG called netrunner, right?

430
00:26:55,081 --> 00:27:03,126
Scott: I saw it in the stores But I ignored it because and I was I rightfully ignored it because every CCG that wasn't magic sort of died, dude I tell spellfire.

431
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:04,733
Rym: Yeah, I played jihad.

432
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:05,034
Rym: There was.

433
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:09,710
Scott: there were so many CCGs that came out when the Star Wars one right.

434
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:14,987
Scott: there were so many that came out when magic first came out That we're trying to compete with magic.

435
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:16,513
Scott: They're like, oh my god, this thing caught on.

436
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,255
Scott: Let's copy it.

437
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:20,911
Scott: Right but They almost all failed.

438
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:28,640
Scott: None of them succeeded until The second round right when you know, like Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh came out all that.

439
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,665
Scott: There was a Star Wars.

440
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:30,971
Scott: There was a Star Trek.

441
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:31,273
Scott: There was.

442
00:27:31,554 --> 00:27:34,531
Scott: there were so many CCGs as Lord of the Rings one.

443
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:41,443
Scott: I had a couple cards from yeah There's the l5r one that I played a little bit right and netrunner was one of those and it there was jihad Which is the ultra rare.

444
00:27:41,484 --> 00:27:42,306
Rym: I was saying jihad.

445
00:27:42,366 --> 00:27:43,349
Rym: I mean day one.

446
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:43,690
Rym: Yep.

447
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:47,000
Rym: But anyway, I have like a whole deck and everything.

448
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,220
Scott: So netrunner was unique in that it was unlike those other ones.

449
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,791
Scott: It was also made by Richard Garfield who made magic the gathering.

450
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:56,380
Scott: he considers it one of his best game designs ever.

451
00:27:57,185 --> 00:27:59,579
Scott: But you know, it disappeared it was ignored and it was a CCG.

452
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:02,371
Scott: So we had no interest in it Even if we knew about it.

453
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:08,320
Scott: because number one, you know I mean remember when I quit playing magic when fallen empires came out.

454
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,375
Scott: I started playing magic shortly before fallen empires came out.

455
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:17,623
Rym: when fallen empires came out I was like wow stop these expansions are really just alliance's came out Alliances.

456
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:20,653
Rym: the last tournament I played in was like the day after.

457
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:25,213
Rym: it was a middle school thing, basically Yeah, and I played in a type 1 tournament.

458
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:26,620
Rym: is the last tournament I played in right?

459
00:28:26,841 --> 00:28:28,419
Rym: I wanted to use my Sol ring and my mocks.

460
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:33,392
Scott: Anyway, so and so netrunner was a game.

461
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,540
Scott: it didn't come, you know, and they didn't promote it.

462
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,036
Scott: They didn't make it win because why would they promote a competitor to their own product, right?

463
00:28:40,237 --> 00:28:40,839
Scott: They didn't do that.

464
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:45,180
Rym: now It'd be fine if they'd have different niches, but you're basically gonna tap the same pool, right?

465
00:28:46,003 --> 00:28:47,208
Rym: Why should we same pool?

466
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:50,200
Scott: Why should they take players away from magic to get them play netrunner?

467
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,586
Rym: I can only tap the pool.

468
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,335
Scott: No one can afford to play two games.

469
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:54,400
Scott: It didn't work out.

470
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,549
Scott: So anyway, apparently fantasy flight games.

471
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:59,856
Scott: It was a great current publisher of games.

472
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:01,280
Scott: It was published many good games.

473
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,840
Scott: They publish Citadel's and a whole bunch of other games.

474
00:29:06,022 --> 00:29:10,047
Scott: they have this thing called a living card game and Apparently they've been going.

475
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:11,760
Scott: I didn't realize that they've been going for a while.

476
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:16,260
Scott: I've always wanted a living card game at least on paper and I didn't realize they were already making them.

477
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:19,073
Scott: They have a call at Cthulhu one and a Game of Thrones one.

478
00:29:19,094 --> 00:29:33,380
Scott: They've been around for a while and what a living card game is is much like a CCG you customize your deck and then you play but Like Dominion, you don't have to buy boosters and starters and collect cards.

479
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:41,925
Scott: You just buy every single expansion once and you will have all the cards and then you make whatever deck you want And then you play against your friends.

480
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:43,109
Scott: So you do.

481
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,819
Scott: it is not a cheap thing to do, right?

482
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,220
Scott: It's about it might even be slightly more expensive than Dominion.

483
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:58,568
Scott: You do have to keep paying money like a subscription to get more cards, but I'm not buying Booster pack exactly to get the rare.

484
00:29:58,628 --> 00:29:58,949
Rym: I'm looking.

485
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,294
Scott: there are no rares.

486
00:30:00,374 --> 00:30:02,300
Scott: There are no uncommons or commons, right?

487
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,864
Scott: You just buy all the cards.

488
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:09,920
Scott: It's like a subscription to a game you pay 15 bucks most months and you will have every card.

489
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:14,617
Scott: one annoying thing is that you know They have these data packs that come out every month.

490
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:21,319
Scott: that are $15 or so and those include three copies of every card that is in them Which is the most you're allowed to have in a deck.

491
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:23,528
Scott: So you only to buy a data pack once and you're set.

492
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:28,277
Scott: but the base set of netrunner the basic box Which you need to buy at least once.

493
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:30,087
Scott: Some of the cards in there.

494
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,172
Scott: they give you three copies.

495
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:32,760
Scott: other cards in there.

496
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,893
Scott: You only get two copies and other cards in there.

497
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:36,000
Scott: You only get one copy.

498
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:55,020
Scott: So if you are all alone and you want to have Every possible if you want to have available to you every possible configure configuration of deck You need to buy the basic netrunner three times, which is bullshit Bullshit, but I did it anyway, and at least when you but do it.

499
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:05,100
Scott: Anyway, you can give a lot of those cards to other people and now they don't have to buy as many other basic sets Unless they really want to have those cards that only appear once.

500
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,685
Scott: There's only like a handful of them.

501
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:11,300
Scott: So really you can get away with two sets pretty well, and it's actually not an expensive game.

502
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,425
Scott: It's like 20 something bucks.

503
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:16,923
Rym: Yeah, I mean I've spent quite a bit more money on Much worse.

504
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:21,440
Scott: to buy two netrunners is the same as buying one, you know, really fancy board game.

505
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:24,360
Scott: So, you know, I'm not too upset but it is bullshit.

506
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,140
Scott: They should they should sell some sort of like completion thing.

507
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,407
Scott: That's like buying the netrunner base box.

508
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:38,512
Scott: then buy this and you'll have everything but whatever anyway, so You get all the action of a CCG without any of the.

509
00:31:39,034 --> 00:31:42,591
Scott: oh he won because he has fancy expensive Black load as I can't afford.

510
00:31:42,631 --> 00:31:43,154
Scott: that's all gone.

511
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:47,652
Scott: There's no pay to win It's just pay to play a lot like say Warhammer.

512
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:59,640
Rym: where you think what I find much more interesting is, you know All that aside just the fact that it's straight up Asymmetric and there's two separate sides with sort of sort of separate goals and very different ways of playing.

513
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:01,590
Rym: That is what seals this for me.

514
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,660
Rym: That is what pushes it away from being just right.

515
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,425
Scott: So I wasn't actually sure how.

516
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:14,280
Scott: I thought that this new Android netrunner, which it takes place in the Android universe Which is I guess fantasy flight is a game called Android which doesn't look to be too good.

517
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,768
Scott: It looks like clue at least based on the description of it.

518
00:32:17,008 --> 00:32:20,680
Scott: and then they released Android infiltration, which we've talked about, right?

519
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,984
Rym: Yeah, which is a great game.

520
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:22,425
Rym: I like it.

521
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,131
Scott: Yeah, and now they have Android netrunner.

522
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:28,023
Scott: Android infiltration is made by the Dominion guy Vacarino whatever.

523
00:32:28,063 --> 00:32:33,920
Scott: so they're putting out these games in this Android cyberpunk universe, which seems to be not a bad universe.

524
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,284
Scott: I like cyberpunk styling.

525
00:32:35,826 --> 00:32:37,030
Scott: So Android netrunner is.

526
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,020
Scott: I didn't realize how identical it was to the original netrunner.

527
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:42,193
Scott: It's very identical in the way it plays.

528
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:44,182
Scott: It's an asymmetrical game like Rym said.

529
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:48,192
Scott: yeah one player is the corporation and one player is the runner.

530
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:54,131
Scott: and the corporation is trying to win either by a Flatlining the runner so that they're dead.

531
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:59,745
Scott: They can't hack into the corporation anymore or two Advancing their corporate agendas.

532
00:32:59,785 --> 00:33:05,523
Scott: so they play agendas advance them and score them and if they score seven points worth of agendas they win.

533
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:15,740
Scott: the runner is trying to either a Deplete the corporation's research and development their deck down to be empty so that the corporation will you know?

534
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:23,522
Scott: Not be able to research anything and lose or be Steal the agendas from the corporation steal seven points worth of agendas Right.

535
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:28,740
Scott: and what this game is all about is, you know, you got a little bit rock-paper-scissors and the deck customization.

536
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:29,794
Scott: Yeah a little bit.

537
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:33,891
Scott: But really what it's all about is the corporation is bluffing.

538
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,520
Scott: They're setting up servers with all these face down cars.

539
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,473
Scott: They're sending out defenses in front of the server.

540
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:39,520
Rym: might not be bluffing.

541
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,772
Rym: I mean you might not have any traps in there

542
00:33:41,792 --> 00:34:00,773
Scott: or might be setting up, you know Facedown defenses in front of the servers and the runner has to attack these servers, you know In you know with their icebreakers and their hacking tools to get past the ice the defenses the facedown defenses And to get into the servers and then access the servers and see what's in there.

543
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:03,543
Rym: now the fact that one player is the attacker And one's the defender.

544
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,713
Rym: the problem is in game and pretty much all games.

545
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,960
Rym: I just I really enjoy playing defense.

546
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:12,219
Rym: So I really really like playing the corporation.

547
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:22,500
Rym: I got to play the runner more to kind of get around a feel for it and also to figure out holes in my current Corporation strategy which by the way involves a Haas Biaroid because I really like them.

548
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:25,833
Scott: But anyway, so I've been playing this game a lot.

549
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:27,179
Scott: There's actually a meetup in the city.

550
00:34:27,221 --> 00:34:28,699
Scott: There's people who play it a lot.

551
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,422
Scott: They've been playing it since it came out of Gen Con some of them and I even went to a tournament at the complete Strategist.

552
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:37,858
Scott: and the only problem with that tournament was that it took all day from like 10 a.m.

553
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:38,661
Scott: To 6.

554
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:45,179
Scott: Well, I guess for maybe it took a while right which you know is knowing but you basically have to play both sides.

555
00:34:45,802 --> 00:34:50,967
Scott: And the weird thing is when I first started playing this game with just people I know like it There's go Joe's party.

556
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:52,179
Scott: I played with Alex a bunch, right?

557
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,150
Scott: The corporation was just sort of unbeatable.

558
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,060
Scott: We didn't understand how to run properly.

559
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,623
Rym: Yeah, but that was.

560
00:34:57,643 --> 00:35:00,680
Rym: that was you know, the jinteki default deck and whatever the runner device.

561
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:04,413
Scott: At the tournament, you know, I had to play against four people.

562
00:35:04,614 --> 00:35:05,840
Scott: It's a Swiss kind of system.

563
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:14,480
Scott: the rules are on the official website and I won three out of four times as runner and I lost three out of four times as corporation.

564
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:31,099
Scott: but I ended up losing overall because in the matches I split I Gave up points some number of points as the you know winning runner But as the corporation I wasn't able to score as many points as I gave up in.

565
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:32,105
Scott: you know The time that it right.

566
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:41,114
Scott: Yeah, so the other person won overall Which means I really only won one out of four times, which is not enough My early magic tournaments.

567
00:35:41,214 --> 00:35:46,019
Scott: I did not do super Well, so it's weird that you know, two people who didn't never played the game before and we're learning it.

568
00:35:46,421 --> 00:35:48,449
Scott: Corporation just couldn't be beat was invincible.

569
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:49,252
Scott: We're like, what the hell.

570
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:51,160
Scott: it was way more fun to be corporation.

571
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,370
Scott: But now I'm way good better at running.

572
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,035
Scott: I think it is running.

573
00:35:56,115 --> 00:35:57,620
Scott: I suck ass at corporation.

574
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:04,428
Rym: I think what it is is that just thinking about the way we play games cuz look we were mostly used to these crazy German games we're used to.

575
00:36:04,468 --> 00:36:10,317
Rym: you know, we I tend to take very Conservative strategies and tend to minimize my risk.

576
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:13,560
Rym: in all games like I'll do I'll make decisions like like in netrunner.

577
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,704
Rym: I think things like up.

578
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:17,734
Rym: I should wait another round to run because I'm gonna.

579
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,280
Rym: I gotta build my deck out that rat.

580
00:36:19,581 --> 00:36:22,496
Rym: You know if he raises that extra ice, I might not be able to beat it.

581
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:23,340
Rym: I don't take any damage.

582
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:24,779
Rym: No, you just gotta fucking go for it.

583
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:32,904
Scott: Yeah, it's usually in all games and this is explained in our favorite book characterisms games by Richard Garfield When you're ahead.

584
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:34,910
Scott: well all it's more it's also by these other people.

585
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,377
Scott: yeah George Scaf Elias you guys should buy.

586
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:38,280
Scott: you never mentioned them.

587
00:36:38,502 --> 00:36:39,109
Rym: Yeah, we should.

588
00:36:39,251 --> 00:36:41,587
Scott: it is written by Those guys.

589
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:43,702
Rym: be like we interview you about your boy It's.

590
00:36:43,963 --> 00:36:47,500
Scott: the other two authors are George Scaf Elias and Robert Gucera.

591
00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:57,584
Scott: Anyway, so it talks about how when you're ahead in a game you tend to play conservatively and when you're behind You play very risky moves Because they're high-risk.

592
00:36:57,604 --> 00:37:02,260
Scott: high-reward move is if you succeeded that you might catch up and if you lose if you fails.

593
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,665
Scott: Well, you were losing anyway, right?

594
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:06,475
Scott: That's why when you're losing in football, you'll do an onsides kick.

595
00:37:06,776 --> 00:37:07,860
Scott: Maybe you get the ball back.

596
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,266
Scott: It's a very small chance.

597
00:37:09,547 --> 00:37:12,700
Scott: But if you do that gives you an opportunity to catch up big time.

598
00:37:13,054 --> 00:37:17,240
Rym: Yeah There's also a second time when you play very aggressively and that's when you're in a sort of equilibrium.

599
00:37:17,681 --> 00:37:19,065
Rym: Hearts is the best example of this.

600
00:37:19,566 --> 00:37:33,415
Rym: for people who play perfectly conservative hearts and are smart enough to keep track of everything The game ends up being pretty random or maybe it comes down to like cards yet Oh, yeah or psychology to a little bit like a little bit of bluffing and everything.

601
00:37:33,495 --> 00:37:39,580
Rym: So then The way to win is, you know, basically you have a 25% chance of winning against everyone.

602
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:49,840
Rym: You're almost better off being the one guy who just fucking goes for it and tries to shoot the moon Even if you're not a hundred percent sure because you only have a 25% chance of winning the whole thing.

603
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:58,159
Rym: Anyway, go big or go home early on because if you go big early on and succeed You can play conservatively the rest of the game and probably win.

604
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:07,965
Rym: So you can increase your odds of winning in a situation where everyone is very skilled and everyone is playing conservatively But it gets very tricky Figuring that out.

605
00:38:08,025 --> 00:38:13,269
Scott: So anyway, the way netrunner is constructed if you try to play Conservatively on either side.

606
00:38:13,772 --> 00:38:15,340
Scott: You're just gonna get hosed, right?

607
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:25,797
Scott: Even if you get ahead and then start playing conservatively that basically is just letting the other guy catch up like Basically, you know in football they say you're running up the score, right?

608
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,647
Scott: And the reason I keep using footballs analogy is the thing.

609
00:38:28,687 --> 00:38:32,560
Scott: netrunner is the football of tabletop gaming, right?

610
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,837
Scott: There's so many, you know.

611
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:43,560
Scott: Mechanically, it doesn't have so much in common with football, you know But in terms of the way it plays out and the flow of it.

612
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:52,760
Rym: It is very hand egg Extremely, it's got that like the damage you do to the runner Like I can do like if Scott's running against me I can do damage to him or deuce his hand.

613
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:54,169
Rym: He only has a few cards in his hand.

614
00:38:54,189 --> 00:38:55,840
Rym: if I get him down to zero I immediately win.

615
00:38:55,941 --> 00:38:57,839
Scott: Oh, you know you have to get him down to negative one.

616
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,480
Rym: If I yeah, I have to get you down to zero and then force you to draw.

617
00:39:00,802 --> 00:39:03,680
Scott: Yes by doing you have to do one more damage than cards in hand.

618
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:13,753
Rym: So I always feel like ah I just gotta push him over the edge and you'll always get so close to that ninth yard and that tenth yard and Nope got a kick.

619
00:39:14,197 --> 00:39:18,576
Scott: Yep but anyway, I Was in.

620
00:39:19,622 --> 00:39:29,000
Rym: But like I would like with the corporation like an example of conservative play say you've got you know You never discard an asset into your archives because you don't want to have to spend resources defending them.

621
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:30,487
Rym: They're not defended yet.

622
00:39:30,648 --> 00:39:31,573
Rym: Yeah, so you've got agendas.

623
00:39:31,593 --> 00:39:36,377
Rym: You're not discarding them into your archives Simultaneously, maybe you've only got two remote servers with ice.

624
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:41,960
Rym: So if you've got two agendas in your hand and you've already deployed two agendas.

625
00:39:42,744 --> 00:39:44,492
Rym: What are you doing with these agendas in your hand?

626
00:39:44,513 --> 00:39:46,000
Rym: The runners gonna eventually attack your hand?

627
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:55,564
Scott: It's like if you take your sweet-ass time only putting down agendas and super safe Servers that are very very iced up that the runner can't get into Your hand.

628
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:57,169
Scott: you have to draw a card every turn.

629
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,015
Scott: your hand will fill with agendas.

630
00:39:59,276 --> 00:40:04,980
Scott: You need to defend HQ Also, it's very very difficult to defend that and enough remote servers.

631
00:40:05,301 --> 00:40:13,593
Rym: Your hand will fill with agendas and you'll be in deep deep shit and it's fine to discard them if you're also defending archives But suddenly you're back in the situation.

632
00:40:13,613 --> 00:40:14,640
Rym: We're not having enough ice.

633
00:40:14,901 --> 00:40:19,438
Scott: Yeah, or you can start putting them out into into other servers and be like I dare you.

634
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,125
Scott: I you know That aren't as well defended.

635
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:30,863
Rym: but the bluffing game is fun because twice I was in a situation where I put out What was the trap and I go advance advance and then if the runner doesn't attack it I'm fucked.

636
00:40:31,104 --> 00:40:34,418
Rym: because if I advance it more but don't finish it, it's obvious.

637
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,446
Scott: It's a trap And you're wasting credits on it.

638
00:40:36,526 --> 00:40:37,028
Rym: Exactly.

639
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:37,510
Scott: You have to.

640
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,444
Rym: you know, it's like but if I didn't advance at all They'd probably also not.

641
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:42,427
Rym: you know, it's it.

642
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:43,610
Rym: there's a point beyond which it is.

643
00:40:43,671 --> 00:40:44,874
Rym: Just which cup is the poison in?

644
00:40:44,894 --> 00:40:55,800
Rym: Yeah, but like poker Humans are kind of stupid in the sense that psychology can matter and I think it's very difficult Especially because a lot of the people are gonna be playing this game.

645
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,453
Rym: There's gonna be the pros and the kind of serious gamers.

646
00:40:59,493 --> 00:41:04,429
Rym: There's gonna be a lot of punk kids like magic, too I mean even in magic tournaments for fun.

647
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,900
Rym: I would play with like 300 card decks and still beat some of these scrubs.

648
00:41:09,282 --> 00:41:10,935
Rym: I'm like, yeah, I got five colors in here.

649
00:41:10,975 --> 00:41:11,318
Rym: Let's go.

650
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:13,642
Rym: Actually four.

651
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:14,665
Rym: I never actually did five.

652
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:16,270
Rym: that would be probably too crazy.

653
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,519
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, you know playing aggressively as the runner, right?

654
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:27,088
Scott: It's like yeah If you're the runner you could choose only to run against servers that you know You can definitely get into safely without getting hurt, right?

655
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:34,229
Scott: If you do that, you're not going to run often enough To actually, you know score any points.

656
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:37,178
Rym: Yeah, you only run run once per round.

657
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,819
Scott: fine I start scoring agendas, right now I did, you know and not eat, you know.

658
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:46,020
Scott: It's like if you don't win that guy has three face down ice on that server.

659
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:48,500
Scott: You just you're like, oh shit if I run there I could just die.

660
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:52,525
Scott: Well, yeah But if you don't run there That means that he is not.

661
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:57,080
Scott: the corporation is not forced to spend the credits required to rez all those ice.

662
00:41:57,542 --> 00:42:01,138
Scott: You're just letting him have a perfect defense without having to pay for it.

663
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,780
Rym: Yeah I just be three chums in a row.

664
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:08,775
Scott: Yeah You have to go and basically face up on my desk as the runner.

665
00:42:08,795 --> 00:42:17,859
Scott: to have any chance of success You have to risk Take big risks at losing or getting hurt or losing credits or taking damage or who knows what in?

666
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:39,940
Scott: order to force the corporation to spend Resources defending to at least slow them down Even if you don't actually score on that move that you're making All right you basically have to spend some amount of resources to make them lose resources to slow them down so that you can catch up and Try to win and maybe take damage in the process and hope you can recover from it.

667
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:41,530
Scott: It's the only way you can possibly.

668
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,100
Scott: so it's like both people.

669
00:42:43,421 --> 00:42:51,999
Scott: the corporation is forced to take risks either, you know secretly putting agendas in the trash or Putting them in less defended servers.

670
00:42:52,060 --> 00:43:14,118
Scott: well at the same time the runner is forced to take risks running into dangerous territory to force the corporation to spend credits rezzing ice and If you if either side doesn't do one of those things They're gonna be in trouble, but it seems like and this is why I think in the early games I played with Alex the corporation always win is that if both people are ultra conservative the

671
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:14,860
Rym: corporation's free.

672
00:43:15,281 --> 00:43:17,807
Scott: The corporation will win.

673
00:43:18,188 --> 00:43:29,620
Scott: but when both people sort of know what they're doing, you know, at least for me I'm doing bad at corporation when people know what they're doing Yeah But I'm doing very well at running when people know what they're doing.

674
00:43:29,723 --> 00:43:35,160
Rym: So yeah The thing is ice combos are tough because you can't really guarantee having cards in the right order.

675
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:41,862
Rym: Like there's one ice that basically says if you hit this ice and you don't break it go back to the beginning of this Run.

676
00:43:42,263 --> 00:43:48,079
Rym: so if you put that first and you have three other ice in front of it you effectively have six ice in front.

677
00:43:48,861 --> 00:43:53,536
Rym: Yeah, but you have to play that first and it's useless first and it's expensive.

678
00:43:53,736 --> 00:43:53,877
Scott: Mm-hmm.

679
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:54,960
Rym: or there's cars.

680
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,727
Rym: They're like, you know draw a bunch of cards.

681
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,680
Rym: if any of them arise just stick them out there for free.

682
00:43:59,861 --> 00:44:03,018
Rym: But they might not be ice, you know, you got to play that the.

683
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,669
Rym: you know The deck building game with magic of all right.

684
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:06,894
Rym: I got four lightning bolts.

685
00:44:07,215 --> 00:44:08,400
Rym: I got four fireballs.

686
00:44:08,681 --> 00:44:08,942
Rym: I got.

687
00:44:08,962 --> 00:44:12,679
Rym: you know, you got to maximize on what your deck is intended to do.

688
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:17,319
Rym: But the more you maximize onto one specific strategy the more open you are.

689
00:44:18,162 --> 00:44:30,920
Rym: But the biggest difference between this and magic is that once you made your deck in magic Unless you're talking about sideboards and shit in tournaments That was 90% of the game the decisions you made in magic were not where they were trivial.

690
00:44:31,282 --> 00:44:31,744
Rym: I was never.

691
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:34,660
Scott: yeah early magic's been changed a lot now since we've played it.

692
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:39,680
Rym: Creatures are way more powerful and I played creature decks back in the day with revised.

693
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:41,126
Rym: I played a green and blue deck.

694
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:42,070
Rym: that would rock your shit.

695
00:44:42,372 --> 00:44:42,532
Scott: Mm-hmm.

696
00:44:43,155 --> 00:44:44,320
Rym: Also green and white occasionally.

697
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:48,080
Scott: So what did you do when you played that guy who just had wrath of God and killed all your creatures?

698
00:44:49,020 --> 00:45:00,020
Rym: Because I was blue I could also I. basically my strategy was tons of creatures which will take a guy out Unless they're the kind of deck that's strong against creatures in which case creatures whatever those are just there.

699
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,096
Rym: I'm mostly wheedling down their deck with my millstones and my other shit.

700
00:45:03,398 --> 00:45:03,619
Scott: Mm-hmm.

701
00:45:04,103 --> 00:45:05,939
Rym: Or I had the creature poison deck.

702
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:13,360
Scott: Anyway, anyway, but what I'm saying is that any netrunner magic that we played was mostly rock-paper-scissors, right?

703
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,840
Scott: What your deck was pretty much determined you're winning or you lose.

704
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:22,708
Rym: Yeah But a netrunner you the decisions you make in the game at least for now and this is Obviously with all games.

705
00:45:22,728 --> 00:45:24,740
Rym: this changes as people start to refine strategies.

706
00:45:25,482 --> 00:45:27,587
Rym: You can change your strategy mid game.

707
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:29,312
Rym: You can play cards different ways.

708
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:33,582
Rym: You actually right now the decisions I make playing Like.

709
00:45:33,642 --> 00:45:35,348
Rym: I'm not making all trivial decisions.

710
00:45:35,389 --> 00:45:36,754
Rym: I'm making complicated decisions.

711
00:45:36,794 --> 00:45:38,420
Rym: Sometimes I'm calculating them out.

712
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,251
Rym: I don't have an overarching strategy to play the game yet.

713
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:43,534
Scott: Yeah magic.

714
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:44,056
Rym: It was drama.

715
00:45:44,096 --> 00:45:45,420
Rym: cards play the optimum order.

716
00:45:46,282 --> 00:45:50,040
Scott: Yeah, and the thing is, you know, I said, you know to bring back the football analogy, right?

717
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:57,679
Scott: Is that you know netrunner, you know people who like like us like high-skill games And why do we like high-skill games that have less luck?

718
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:05,944
Scott: Because then if you win it's because you won and because of your awesomeness and you lose is because you weren't simultaneously Like tennis.

719
00:46:06,044 --> 00:46:10,840
Rym: remember when we played that horse racing game in Albany that one time?

720
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:12,950
Rym: Yeah, that game was random bullshit.

721
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:13,372
Rym: You know, what?

722
00:46:13,392 --> 00:46:15,140
Rym: It's just as fun, right?

723
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:21,560
Scott: Well, the thing is there's an amount of luck that can make it to where the better player is still gonna win.

724
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:28,820
Scott: But the luck and randomness makes the game kind of more interesting and makes decision-making much much harder, right?

725
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:37,975
Scott: When I make a decision in Puerto Rico, all right, I'm like, well if I do this He loses three and I get four right in netrunner.

726
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:38,980
Scott: It's a similar decision.

727
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:45,220
Scott: I'll do this, but he has a 60% chance of losing three and I have a 70% chance of getting four.

728
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,220
Scott: All right, let's you know, it's that percentages that are in there.

729
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,680
Scott: So you're still, you know, you know what the odds are on certain things.

730
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:59,620
Scott: You know what the costs and resources are in certain things But there's a certain element of chance to it right where it might not go your way.

731
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:06,120
Scott: It might go your way But you can sort of calculate the odds Mostly and not do things that have a load low chance of success.

732
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:10,920
Rym: There is one other case though that the simulation the edge like certain kinds of war games and games can be fun where?

733
00:47:11,421 --> 00:47:20,126
Rym: There is a lot of random bullshit But that's because they're kind of a simulation of reality and the process of going through the game and seeing what the results are Is the primarily interesting

734
00:47:20,186 --> 00:47:28,543
Scott: part I'm saying just like, you know in sports right any sport, you know There's a. you know, tennis is the example is less luck But I mean even football.

735
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:39,280
Scott: the wind blew the ball around or you know, the guy just had a slippery finger, you know There's so many little things that just can't you know that are so far beyond your control, right?

736
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,651
Scott: And netrunner has a lot of those things just little things everywhere.

737
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:49,560
Scott: They just might go wrong might go right You know, you don't know what that one card was and it throws a loop in your whole thing.

738
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:52,709
Scott: Uh, you know you draw five cards to start the game.

739
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:56,380
Scott: what those five cards are is kind of can change everything.

740
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,227
Scott: You know one game I played at that tournament.

741
00:47:58,288 --> 00:47:59,894
Scott: I won almost instantly.

742
00:47:59,954 --> 00:48:00,536
Scott: I felt bad.

743
00:48:00,597 --> 00:48:01,440
Scott: It was so unfair.

744
00:48:01,702 --> 00:48:09,779
Scott: I'm gonna remember that guy in that game because We just mean him just couldn't shut up about how bad that game went for him how much bullshit it was, right?

745
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,515
Rym: Yeah, but then again, I mean he even Accelerated beta test drew three cards.

746
00:48:14,596 --> 00:48:17,647
Rym: No ice I mean in magic sometimes I draw all land.

747
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:20,394
Rym: call the farmer hand draw land again.

748
00:48:20,415 --> 00:48:21,758
Rym: Like it can happen.

749
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:25,540
Scott: Yeah You know or is a netrunner the same exact deck?

750
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:30,316
Scott: You're only allowed three cards of any one type, you know of the same name in the deck.

751
00:48:30,537 --> 00:48:32,929
Rym: now if any you can About that rule.

752
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:40,240
Scott: There's a reason that rule is Yeah, and you have to have a minimum deck size and you have to have a certain number of agenda points in a corporation deck.

753
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:55,780
Rym: So it's like, you know you when you draw five you can draw drastically different hands and that changes how you play a Lot, but meanwhile in magic drawing the hand you don't make a decision You just play the hand out no matter what it is.

754
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,920
Rym: You're not thinking like well do I want to risk this now considering that I drew all my assets?

755
00:49:01,504 --> 00:49:08,560
Scott: Also in making the deck right the deck construction rules You can only bring in so many influence points worth of cards from other factions.

756
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:11,320
Scott: So, you know that any deck you play against you see their identity card.

757
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:15,250
Scott: You know what most of their cards can be right.

758
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:28,028
Scott: there will only be a few cards that aren't cards you expect from them so you can look at how they play and sort of play this meta game once you know all the cards because there aren't that many of What did they bring in right?

759
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:31,420
Scott: if you don't see a lot of cards of that don't go with their identity?

760
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,960
Scott: You know that they probably just have a few really powerful cards from the other identities.

761
00:49:36,081 --> 00:49:36,362
Scott: Maybe.

762
00:49:36,463 --> 00:49:39,820
Scott: four point, you know influence cards like scorched earth which do for damage.

763
00:49:40,442 --> 00:49:48,520
Scott: But then again if you see a lot of cards of different colors right out on the table And that means they don't have a lot of high influence cards.

764
00:49:48,761 --> 00:49:57,039
Scott: So now you don't need to worry maybe about a scorched earth in a deck that isn't Wayland And that means that you can take tags and not really worry about getting instantly killed.

765
00:49:57,943 --> 00:50:04,632
Rym: And you know, but then again the the high-risk strategy of you've got all little cars You've got one fucking scorched earth in there.

766
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:06,060
Scott: just one and one isn't enough.

767
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:11,239
Scott: You gotta have two at least right and you really if you're gonna do any if you're gonna base your game around a card You gotta have three.

768
00:50:12,882 --> 00:50:15,838
Scott: The other thing is when you're making the corporation deck you to put agendas in.

769
00:50:15,919 --> 00:50:18,060
Scott: well You have to put a certain number of agenda points.

770
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,390
Scott: So if you're what you want to do is the rules.

771
00:50:20,732 --> 00:50:31,582
Scott: the minimum deck size is 45 But if your deck contains between 45 and 49 cards, you have to have 20 or 21 Agenda points.

772
00:50:32,143 --> 00:50:42,147
Scott: So ideally ideally what you would do is make a 49 card deck with 20 agenda points thus to maximize the.

773
00:50:42,348 --> 00:50:46,538
Scott: you know, the did lessen the chance of an agenda card coming up.

774
00:50:46,638 --> 00:50:47,982
Scott: you don't want you know that way.

775
00:50:48,042 --> 00:51:06,634
Scott: when the the runner accesses your hand to your deck the odds of them getting an agenda card are low, but You might want to put in agenda cards that are only worth one point each because you can score those quickly without having to Defend them very much which makes the points much easier to get.

776
00:51:06,735 --> 00:51:09,083
Scott: if you get a really powerful agenda That's worth three points.

777
00:51:09,364 --> 00:51:13,900
Scott: You have to leave it on the table and advance it a whole bunch before you can score.

778
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,530
Scott: It's in a very vulnerable position.

779
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:17,000
Scott: You know, there's a bunch of ice in front of it.

780
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:25,900
Rym: So if you're gonna do like if you're gonna do smaller number of high point ones You probably want to play someone or you can have a bunch of traps, too Right, but it's it's like you have to balance this out.

781
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:33,889
Scott: Right, if I have a whole bunch of cheap agendas, my deck has a lot of agendas in it The runner is gonna score But they're not gonna score a lot of.

782
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:39,612
Scott: you know, they're gonna score a whole bunch of ones But if I put a bunch of threes they still might score.

783
00:51:39,672 --> 00:51:42,420
Scott: the odds are still like one in four of them getting an agenda.

784
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:51,382
Scott: They're still not great for you But when they do score they're gonna get two or three points and that means that in your deck there will be less non Agendas.

785
00:51:51,844 --> 00:51:57,040
Scott: so this game gives you all kinds of crazy things to think about and new cards coming out all the time.

786
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:58,387
Scott: Yeah, it costs money.

787
00:51:58,467 --> 00:52:00,719
Scott: But hey, it costs a fixed amount of money.

788
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:17,451
Scott: You never had to spend crazy amounts of extra money collecting, you know to get all the cards you need or buying singles or any of that nonsense and at the same time you can know what all the cards are and Really that turns out to be one of the things we're knowing.

789
00:52:17,491 --> 00:52:19,680
Scott: what all the cards are matters a lot.

790
00:52:20,025 --> 00:52:25,722
Scott: But I sort of you know I've played only for like a couple weeks and I already know most of the major cards and Some of them.

791
00:52:25,782 --> 00:52:28,913
Scott: it's like just the first time you play it's obvious what the good cards are.

792
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:29,776
Scott: on magnum opus.

793
00:52:29,977 --> 00:52:33,199
Rym: Yeah, right It's not a big fan of the toll booth.

794
00:52:33,615 --> 00:52:40,421
Scott: Yeah the toll booth and magnum opus are like the most obviously good cards and you just read through the cards and it's like oh I Get it.

795
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:41,243
Scott: I get it.

796
00:52:41,764 --> 00:52:42,025
Scott: I get.

797
00:52:42,065 --> 00:52:43,789
Rym: you can't underestimate the economy though.

798
00:52:44,491 --> 00:52:46,215
Scott: It's it's all about economy.

799
00:52:46,235 --> 00:52:51,380
Rym: Yeah, I Know it's a super fun game that we'll probably review in much more depth.

800
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,686
Rym: That's where you play it a whole bunch.

801
00:52:52,826 --> 00:52:59,640
Scott: and the thing I the real thing I see here right is that You know, we look at all the kinds of tabletop games out there, right?

802
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,980
Scott: You got the high investment ones the miniatures the RPGs the eclipses, right?

803
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,409
Scott: They take a long time to play.

804
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:08,200
Scott: you have to learn a lot of complicated rules.

805
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,173
Scott: They're really satisfying though, but you need a big table.

806
00:53:11,193 --> 00:53:12,800
Scott: You need a big investment, right?

807
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,492
Scott: So it's really hard to get anyone to play those but mean it like magic.

808
00:53:15,573 --> 00:53:22,880
Scott: I would just play with like a friend In the cafeteria, you got the medium investment the Puerto Rico's and the power grids and those types.

809
00:53:23,202 --> 00:53:25,960
Scott: You got the low investments like the spot is right.

810
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:34,580
Scott: But the thing is those low investment ones, you know to learn is not so much But you know to bust them out and play them is very quick, right?

811
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,452
Scott: But it's not as satisfying strategically really.

812
00:53:37,773 --> 00:53:45,643
Scott: what you get with the CCG Right like magic is a game you can just sort of bust out and play casually like a instant play Whatever.

813
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:49,826
Scott: you can play it with someone who knows how to play and has it as Easily as you can play.

814
00:53:49,846 --> 00:53:50,973
Scott: spot it because they know how to play.

815
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:51,416
Scott: you know how to play.

816
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,020
Scott: you both have cards.

817
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,405
Scott: Just bust it out and play really quick.

818
00:53:53,466 --> 00:53:58,687
Scott: One, two, three, right nutrunner takes a little while a little longer than spot it But it's not a high investment.

819
00:53:58,707 --> 00:54:01,518
Scott: You can just sort of be sitting around, you know wasting time with it.

820
00:54:02,682 --> 00:54:10,060
Rym: You know, it's also got the single person not player But person component of like the deck building and the fucking around when you're just messing.

821
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,530
Rym: Yeah, I can be sitting around at home just flipping through the cards.

822
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:14,840
Rym: Like I wonder if I should replace one of those eyes.

823
00:54:15,022 --> 00:54:16,499
Scott: It gives you something to do.

824
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:21,280
Scott: You can play the game when no one else is around by looking through the cards and customize.

825
00:54:21,381 --> 00:54:24,800
Rym: Well, like we play we used to play a battle tech a lot in our IT and you know what?

826
00:54:25,941 --> 00:54:30,019
Rym: Half the fun was just fucking around in a mech builder a mech maker making max

827
00:54:30,321 --> 00:54:30,843
Scott: Yep, even

828
00:54:30,863 --> 00:54:32,129
Rym: if I never played with those mess,

829
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:38,640
Scott: you know by having just one of these games Even if you don't pick netrunner, maybe you pick a CCG then you want to waste all your money.

830
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,070
Scott: Maybe you pick another living card game.

831
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:43,700
Scott: I know some people play the Game of Thrones one.

832
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,960
Scott: I think there's a Cthulhu one also, you know, maybe you know.

833
00:54:47,123 --> 00:54:49,125
Scott: But whatever it is It fills that niche of.

834
00:54:49,546 --> 00:54:54,665
Scott: you can spend time on your tabletop hobby when no one else is around customizing your deck.

835
00:54:54,826 --> 00:55:01,799
Scott: or you know miniatures painting or you know in it, right and It's a game where if there's other people around you know how to play it.

836
00:55:02,241 --> 00:55:08,739
Scott: You can bust it out with low effort, even though there's still an effort to learn it or buy it You can bust it out with low effort.

837
00:55:09,002 --> 00:55:16,083
Scott: So like me and Rimmer hanging out, you know We can play it as easily as we could play spot it and that's you could not say the same thing for a big Board game.

838
00:55:16,103 --> 00:55:18,898
Scott: that requires setting up pieces and all that kind of nonsense.

839
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,559
Rym: Yep I mean, I would play magic just all the fucking time for years.

840
00:55:21,972 --> 00:55:25,971
Scott: Yep so it really fills that niche of the tabletop spectrum.

841
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:39,922
Scott: if you've got one one of these games and You know the low-end spot it type games dixit types You know the medium German board games and the high investment games that covers every possible tabletop gaming scenario you could be in.

842
00:55:40,344 --> 00:55:51,436
Scott: there'll be a game for all seasons for all times of day for all flavors for all numbers of people for All everything and this is sort of the one that was missing and it also has a serious competition aspect.

843
00:55:51,697 --> 00:55:56,640
Rym: That is pretty interesting You know, I'll have to decide if I'm going to engage on that or not.

844
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,915
Scott: Yeah, I don't know how serious I'm gonna be.

845
00:55:58,995 --> 00:56:00,001
Scott: I guess, you know I'll go.

846
00:56:00,162 --> 00:56:04,120
Rym: I was pretty serious about magic like I would make my parents drive me to these tournaments.

847
00:56:04,562 --> 00:56:06,270
Scott: Yeah, I went to one local tournament.

848
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:07,255
Scott: It was kind of fun.

849
00:56:07,336 --> 00:56:08,200
Scott: I'd probably go back.

850
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:12,075
Scott: It's like I think what it is is if it doesn't conflict with my existing schedule.

851
00:56:12,677 --> 00:56:13,219
Scott: Why not go?

852
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,345
Scott: You know, I'll go check it out.

853
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:14,768
Scott: Why not?

854
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:16,960
Scott: and I'm only gonna get serious.

855
00:56:17,181 --> 00:56:17,301
Scott: I'll.

856
00:56:17,321 --> 00:56:27,379
Scott: you know, I'll try to win obviously with my usual level of tabletop skill, but if I start winning right, seriously Then I may attempt to go.

857
00:56:28,441 --> 00:56:33,137
Scott: Yeah, it's like if I start kicking everyone's ass locally like these people who are really good the stars.

858
00:56:33,178 --> 00:56:38,960
Rym: if you were really good You might run into the situation of the Street Fighter champion among friends who can't beat anyone in the pro circuit.

859
00:56:39,321 --> 00:56:47,919
Scott: I may I may but if I do start winning a whole bunch and I surpass everybody I may go one step up to see if I can beat people.

860
00:56:48,019 --> 00:56:48,120
Rym: now.

861
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:59,138
Rym: What'll be interesting to see is that in the old days of magic before they really settled on these draft Tournaments before they really settled on like, you know, I don't know what they call them now But the old days they had type zero type one and type two.

862
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:06,100
Rym: Type two being you can only use like the current base set and the previous two released expansions to like limit the card set.

863
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,250
Rym: so it prevented the problem to a degree.

864
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:19,919
Rym: couple of the fact that there was barely an internet back then where there were to merge like a handful of decks that were just like the best and You could just find like the deck list and they were kind of like traded by

865
00:57:20,301 --> 00:57:22,227
Scott: The net runner like world champion.

866
00:57:22,247 --> 00:57:23,190
Scott: deck lists are online.

867
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:23,833
Scott: You can go look at them.

868
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,980
Scott: Yeah, I know so you can make them go for it.

869
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:38,420
Rym: Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see if I get to the point where I am building decks to change how I play or I end up taking a deck that is known to be the champion and learning how to play it.

870
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,026
Scott: There is significant meta game.

871
00:57:40,147 --> 00:57:40,368
Scott: right.

872
00:57:40,488 --> 00:57:47,052
Scott: if you try to play the champions deck in the next tournament You'll just lose because there are people who are doing the sort.

873
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:49,080
Scott: of which cup did I put the poison in?

874
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,920
Scott: I'll make the deck that beat the champions deck from last year.

875
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,479
Scott: But there's people who are playing two steps ahead of that saying well Everyone's gonna try to beat the champions there from last year.

876
00:57:56,701 --> 00:57:59,071
Scott: So I'll make a deck that beats the deck that could beat that deck.

877
00:57:59,453 --> 00:58:00,960
Scott: and then other people are you know?

878
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:01,724
Scott: So it's really.

879
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,740
Scott: you just have to pick a strategy and play well.

880
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:08,757
Scott: And you know the meta game is only some aspect right like the scorched earth we talked about.

881
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:09,540
Scott: it does for damage.

882
00:58:10,064 --> 00:58:12,843
Scott: There were a lot of people who are saying yes score It's so obvious.

883
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:15,431
Scott: play NBN because that's the easiest to tag someone.

884
00:58:15,732 --> 00:58:19,487
Scott: they need to be tagged to do the damage and then put scorched Earth into it to kill them.

885
00:58:19,749 --> 00:58:26,836
Scott: and a lot of some people played that deck But everyone enough people are playing that deck that everyone sort of can beat it now.

886
00:58:27,116 --> 00:58:28,380
Scott: It's not so dangerous.

887
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,427
Rym: Well look at the early days of magic.

888
00:58:29,508 --> 00:58:31,240
Rym: It was like Oh red deck.

889
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:36,500
Rym: It's all just fucking fireballs and lightning bolts, and you just burn your way down 40 card deck bare minimum.

890
00:58:36,965 --> 00:58:38,040
Scott: Just attack attack attack.

891
00:58:38,062 --> 00:58:39,886
Scott: Yeah There's a card plastic Greek carapace.

892
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:43,920
Scott: people are just putting two of them in their decks now to make sure that scorcher doesn't work.

893
00:58:44,362 --> 00:58:47,795
Scott: And now it doesn't work, so now what do you do if you're playing the scorcher deck?

894
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:48,398
Scott: sure it might work.

895
00:58:48,478 --> 00:58:49,884
Scott: sometimes I got hit by it.

896
00:58:50,206 --> 00:58:50,488
Scott: there were.

897
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:56,593
Scott: there were a few scorched earth still going around in the tournament I was at but for the most part scorched earth didn't win the tournament.

898
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,459
Scott: right it won a few matches here and there.

899
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:01,840
Scott: But it's like yeah, you know everyone knows about that.

900
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:02,644
Scott: It's not gonna.

901
00:59:02,785 --> 00:59:04,234
Scott: the meta game is not gonna work.

902
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:05,220
Scott: people know what's coming.

903
00:59:05,481 --> 00:59:11,300
Rym: But eventually the things can crystallize to a degree like there will eventually be unless they start cutting out old cards.

904
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:13,371
Rym: I'm sure they planned like I'm sure they designed.

905
00:59:13,411 --> 00:59:15,120
Scott: you should read the tournament rules.

906
00:59:15,923 --> 00:59:21,240
Rym: You know I'm saying I'm sure they that the designers designed the first several sets all at once.

907
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,300
Rym: So they're just kind of yeah.

908
00:59:22,481 --> 00:59:26,654
Scott: They have like previews of like sets for months from now like five sets down the road.

909
00:59:26,715 --> 00:59:28,644
Scott: even only two data packs are currently on Sale.

910
00:59:28,664 --> 00:59:29,780
Scott: I think the third one's coming out.

911
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:34,414
Rym: It'll be interesting to see if tournaments start converging on a small handful of decks.

912
00:59:34,454 --> 00:59:41,080
Rym: because if if that happens rapidly I'm going to take one of those decks and then modify it for myself and my style of play.

913
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:45,840
Scott: I doubt it because I think it's a circle of you know Rock-paper-scissors in all sorts of different directions.

914
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,147
Scott: I don't think there's a deck that you know.

915
00:59:47,429 --> 00:59:53,140
Scott: for any deck that you make no matter how good You you might just come up against the guy who happened to make the deck.

916
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:59,620
Rym: Oh, yeah, the shit might be a deck that in that rock-paper-scissors Statistically wins more on average.

917
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:04,100
Scott: I think this is why I'm interested in this game because I think you know you look at the way that the rules are.

918
01:00:04,562 --> 01:00:06,651
Scott: The playing matters more than the deck making.

919
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:07,333
Scott: you could not.

920
01:00:07,655 --> 01:00:09,282
Scott: you could not make a deck That's just.

921
01:00:09,342 --> 01:00:10,086
Scott: you could make a deck.

922
01:00:10,126 --> 01:00:16,959
Rym: see the thing is eventually the playing all game like Stratego Was like that, but eventually you come up with very strong heuristics.

923
01:00:16,979 --> 01:00:17,622
Scott: well Yes, they're.

924
01:00:17,742 --> 01:00:21,678
Scott: obviously there are decks you can make that are just fucking stupid and aren't gonna win.

925
01:00:21,698 --> 01:00:28,800
Scott: all right They can't win because you didn't put enough economy cards You didn't put enough ice or you didn't put an icebreaker for code gates.

926
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:31,858
Scott: You can never break a code gate you can make it just a stupid broken deck.

927
01:00:32,561 --> 01:00:41,012
Scott: But overall amongst the good decks you can make you know there's enough variation that it's interesting Yeah, but there's nothing that you can do.

928
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:42,720
Scott: That's just better.

929
01:00:42,961 --> 01:00:54,720
Rym: And it doesn't matter how you play it only in the sense that we have not had enough statistical data To see if there are particular strategies that statistically win more than other strategies other than basic stuff.

930
01:00:55,262 --> 01:00:59,100
Rym: So it'll be interesting to see over the next few years if the game becomes more popular.

931
01:00:59,261 --> 01:01:00,186
Scott: But I mean I had there.

932
01:01:00,266 --> 01:01:02,980
Scott: there are already other living card games the Cthulhu one in the game.

933
01:01:03,764 --> 01:01:09,580
Rym: So and it is not happening with those seat now you say that But I don't know how much data there is for those games.

934
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,046
Scott: There's a lot of people playing those games.

935
01:01:11,066 --> 01:01:14,600
Rym: there are but those kinds of games draw different kinds of gamers.

936
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:22,189
Rym: I don't think there's a huge competition between like the player Serious tournament, I know they do but so does Yu-Gi-Oh.

937
01:01:22,209 --> 01:01:25,680
Rym: yeah, Yu-Gi-Oh is one of the most popular card games with huge tournaments.

938
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:30,254
Scott: Yeah, well you know Yu-Gi-Oh, but the rules of Yu-Gi-Oh are such that you know.

939
01:01:30,335 --> 01:01:32,402
Scott: It's you know vanilla coke I know.

940
01:01:32,502 --> 01:01:37,120
Rym: I'm just saying that players will eventually solidify on pretty strong heuristics for play.

941
01:01:37,884 --> 01:01:49,630
Rym: There will definitely be a subset of possible decks Who are able to play sufficiently randomly when it comes down to enacting their strategies in terms of you know What percentage chance do I bluff?

942
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:51,299
Rym: and all that once those are kind of down?

943
01:01:52,102 --> 01:01:56,140
Rym: It will fall back on just deck building at the highest level of play.

944
01:01:56,321 --> 01:01:57,626
Scott: I do not think it will fall back on.

945
01:01:57,646 --> 01:02:02,567
Rym: it has to because the game isn't that complex in the sense that a player there's no way there are.

946
01:02:02,587 --> 01:02:15,457
Rym: there won't be players who come up with if Not perfect in a mathematical sense, but effectively perfect human directional heuristics I think for a deck that they have constructed in which case the deck itself is what matters.

947
01:02:15,497 --> 01:02:17,022
Rym: they have a strategy They're gonna follow.

948
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:19,571
Scott: I think I think you could fight that.

949
01:02:19,631 --> 01:02:22,400
Scott: you could take the world champion decks give them to us.

950
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:25,209
Scott: We know how to play but we're not the world champions right.

951
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:33,660
Scott: and let's say when those two world champions played against each other the People in the finals deck a beat deck be 60% of the time with us to playing.

952
01:02:33,882 --> 01:02:37,006
Scott: You know not playing the way that they played, but yeah My argument would not be 60% of the time.

953
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:40,244
Rym: It doesn't refute my argument.

954
01:02:40,264 --> 01:02:41,328
Scott: the other deck might win.

955
01:02:41,509 --> 01:02:49,540
Rym: that doesn't refute my argument at all because if I play enough to develop those Strong heuristics, then my statistics will probably match those of the expert players.

956
01:02:50,622 --> 01:02:51,405
Scott: I do not think so.

957
01:02:51,425 --> 01:02:53,936
Rym: I'm pretty sure that's what's gonna happen.

958
01:02:54,439 --> 01:02:59,650
Scott: anyway There was one other thing I wanted to say trying to remember.

959
01:02:59,771 --> 01:03:02,700
Rym: I mean I'm digging the game I bought into it.

960
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,543
Rym: I'm buying every set.

961
01:03:03,584 --> 01:03:05,391
Rym: I ordered sleeves for my cards.

962
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,580
Scott: Yeah, oh, I gotta show you a sleeve shuffling trick.

963
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,949
Rym: I learned I watched a bunch of YouTube video.

964
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:14,718
Scott: No the YouTube videos do not teach you the most important trick That I have learned from a guy.

965
01:03:15,801 --> 01:03:17,007
Rym: You learn something from some guy.

966
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:18,293
Scott: I did all right.

967
01:03:18,313 --> 01:03:19,378
Rym: You should make a YouTube video.

968
01:03:19,539 --> 01:03:19,800
Scott: I will.

969
01:03:21,102 --> 01:03:21,908
Rym: Anyway, I think we're done.

970
01:03:21,948 --> 01:03:23,520
Scott: We have talked a great deal about this game.

971
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:30,809
Scott: We will probably be talking about it a lot more in the future if we play it a whole bunch more Which at least I know I'm gonna get there.

972
01:03:30,829 --> 01:03:31,674
Scott: you spend enough money on.

973
01:03:31,714 --> 01:03:32,579
Scott: I gotta get my mom's work.

974
01:03:37,205 --> 01:03:39,740
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

975
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:44,655
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

976
01:03:44,856 --> 01:03:49,914
Scott: be sure to visit our website At front row crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

977
01:03:50,155 --> 01:03:57,180
Rym: remember GeekNights is not one But four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

978
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,076

979
01:04:02,341 --> 01:04:07,096
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows.

980
01:04:07,216 --> 01:04:08,520
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
