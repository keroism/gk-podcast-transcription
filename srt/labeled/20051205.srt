1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,872
Rym: It's Monday December 5th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:15,319
Rym: We talk about money, and how not to suck with it.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,240
Rym: Let's do this Yeah, so we had a weekend of super geek up in Albany.

4
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:24,091
Scott: Super geek played all them board games.

5
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:28,919
Scott: Yeah, we didn't play a Moisture yeah, and turns out whatever it looks like it could have been the most fun.

6
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,459
Rym: We played a bad board game, and we feel sorry for our friend who bought it.

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,882
Scott: Yeah It always.

8
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:39,166
Scott: it always kind of hurts when you buy something and then you're not gonna use it or someone buys you something and you Don't want it.

9
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:40,618
Scott: It's it's kind of an ad.

10
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:40,820
Rym: yeah.

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,085
Rym: Now I got a couple of board games.

12
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:43,607
Rym: I bought that.

13
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,920
Rym: we haven't played in years, so I really can't hate on him too much.

14
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:49,880
Scott: Yeah, I'm all smart piling my spiel disjars.

15
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:54,379
Scott: I think I've only got one board game now that no one wants to play hellas hellas.

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:59,499
Rym: We'll be talking about hellas tomorrow because one I broke that game into the games broken independently of me.

17
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:01,750
Scott: Yeah, it's just busted up.

18
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:03,056
Scott: Yeah, I can see why.

19
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:10,555
Scott: now on board game geek There's lots of trading and selling and buying of games You know, but I think I'll stick to you know because I'm into more than just.

20
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:15,000
Scott: I can see if you're into just games That you would buy and trade and sell all different types of games.

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,188
Scott: But when you're someone like me who does a bunch of other stuff and board games You just get the best of the best and screw the rest.

22
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:22,352
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

23
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:24,640
Scott: Yeah, so I didn't go to work today.

24
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:32,352
Rym: Oh, yeah I noticed cuz I woke up and I was about to go through my normal morning routine And then I heard a grumbly noise and lo and behold your home.

25
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:33,997
Scott: Yeah, it's like you know.

26
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:36,088
Scott: some people live Maybe you know half-hour from work.

27
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:39,325
Scott: So if they wake up, you know a little bit late They can still go to work late.

28
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,981
Rym: I show up to work anytime between 7 and like 11.

29
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:45,731
Scott: Yeah, I wake up at 5 30 in the morning.

30
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:53,060
Scott: And if I wake up at 7 or later I might as well not go to work because the train ride I'd get to work.

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,680
Scott: I'd be there for about three hours and they can know the train ride home and it's not worth it at all.

32
00:01:58,002 --> 00:01:59,308
Scott: It's easier to just work from home.

33
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,614
Rym: I guess it's good though.

34
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:01,659
Rym: It forces you to wake up.

35
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:07,080
Rym: I mean, I know I can lay in bed another hour and I often do and then I have to stay at work another hour.

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:16,860
Scott: Yeah, I only messed up a couple times and sometimes there's gotten that 726 train, you know, and I Think you're just a little ill and you seem kind of tired.

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,140
Rym: We were trying to watch a ninja movie up in Albany, but you kept falling asleep.

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,803
Scott: Well, cuz it was.

39
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:24,119
Scott: I wouldn't I would have made it if I would have sat up but I laid down and that was it.

40
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:26,390
Rym: This ninja movie was fantastic.

41
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,335
Rym: We'll have to talk about it.

42
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:31,420
Scott: All right We saw barely any of it so I can't really talk to him.

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,368
Rym: I think we'll have to do a whole podcast on bad ninja movies Mm-hmm, because we have several.

44
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,396
Scott: but anyway during my day at home today.

45
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:43,500
Scott: I made an Awesome little demo combining some technologies.

46
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:46,508
Rym: Okay, I take it you use canvas.

47
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:49,900
Scott: I use the little Firefox canvas and I combined it.

48
00:02:49,960 --> 00:03:09,440
Scott: Well, it's not the Firefox canvas is the HTML canvas element and I combined it with the Ajax HTML HTTP request whatever the hell it's called thing so I can Lively update a drawing surface on a web page from a web application without reloading or anything.

49
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,520
Rym: Did you did you draw a penis?

50
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:28,230
Scott: No, but I'm sure The point is is that what I can basically do using this technology is if I spend more than a couple hours on it Is I can make an MMO in 3d in a web browser That requires no downloading.

51
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,500
Scott: No installing and no plugins.

52
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:35,619
Rym: You know, not bad because we've always been bouncing around that idea of an awesome MMO.

53
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:40,300
Scott: Yeah, basically, I'm just gonna not go that far and make like a board game or something.

54
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:52,833
Scott: Yeah for now, but if we ever get any more coders to live near us Yeah, because he before you were just restricted to drawing on the web page whatever you could draw with pings and gifs and CSS and HTML.

55
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:54,999
Scott: now I can draw Anything.

56
00:03:56,525 --> 00:04:00,120
Scott: So it's like oh, yeah My day was great.

57
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:16,920
Rym: I had to set up a secondary DNS server somewhere and I discovered that the routing path between My network and the network where the real DNS server is is blocking DNS traffic specifically and only DNS traffic Thus present preventing me from doing my job.

58
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:25,339
Scott: Wait, but if you block DNS traffic right and the DNS traffic on the blocked side if the DNS server on the block side goes Down won't they lose DNS?

59
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,114
Rym: They don't get DNS where I am anyway, because it's blocked.

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,026
Scott: Oh There is no DNS server in there.

61
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:41,659
Rym: No, it's my own private network that I'm using to build some cool thing I can't really talk about but I have to deal with people who don't particularly care if I complete my job.

62
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:44,683
Rym: Ah It's awesome.

63
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:45,886
Scott: Totally awesome.

64
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:49,776
Rym: I just found it great that they blocked only that the one thing I needed.

65
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:51,080
Rym: everything else is fine.

66
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:54,416
Scott: Yeah, maybe they knew that was the thing you need and they want to get rid of you.

67
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:58,520
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so it's strike two for Bell South.

68
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,464
Scott: You mean strike three?

69
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:02,028
Rym: They had a first strike.

70
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,793
Scott: Yeah, they suck.

71
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,947
Rym: I Mean First they do.

72
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:14,767
Rym: they're crazy, you know Ruined the internet ideas and now They did something really kind of.

73
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,922
Rym: I guess asshole is the only word that can be used to describe this Mm-hmm.

74
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:24,619
Rym: So they promised New Orleans they were gonna just as a donation rebuild a police station or some building for him.

75
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,063
Rym: Okay, it was a donation.

76
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:26,865
Rym: They can pick up the tab.

77
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:27,527
Rym: Mm-hmm.

78
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:32,420
Rym: independent of that New Orleans is offering all the flood victims free Wi-Fi.

79
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,893
Rym: They're trying to build a Wi-Fi network to get people back in touch.

80
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:37,419
Rym: since the phone lines are all still down.

81
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:46,615
Rym: Bell South found out about this decided they didn't like the unfair competition Had an wrote an angry letter to New Orleans and rescinded their donation.

82
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,060
Scott: Well, what were they donating?

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,215
Rym: They I just said they were gonna repair a building.

84
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:57,780
Scott: now See I could understand if you're donating some Wi-Fi and they said screw you we have our own that you would rescind your donation.

85
00:05:58,444 --> 00:06:03,984
Scott: maybe donating a building to be nice and then it's like You know.

86
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:07,620
Scott: the image to the public is that we're donating because we're good people.

87
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:13,620
Scott: But really the the truth apparently is we're donating because we're basically buying business.

88
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:18,360
Scott: We're giving you something that we don't need in exchange for business and we don't get the business.

89
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,530
Scott: We're not gonna donate to you.

90
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:26,900
Rym: even better They rescinded the donation about a couple hours after the city announced his Wi-Fi plans.

91
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:31,352
Rym: They called him and angrily told them why like just girl you bastards.

92
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:32,856
Rym: We're not gonna give you our donation now.

93
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:34,120
Rym: Well, yeah.

94
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:39,174
Rym: So, uh, I guess Bell South is on the list of things for boycotting.

95
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:41,000
Scott: yeah Bell South this is a bunch of asshats.

96
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,466
Rym: Yeah, Bell South is right up there.

97
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:42,827
Rym: But let's see.

98
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:48,276
Rym: We're boycotting American Greetings still the RA RIA Walmart Target.

99
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:57,400
Scott: Yeah, except for that whole pharmacy thing, yeah, it's nice but it could be a worse pharmacy thing than their policy.

100
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,188
Scott: Their policy is like the borderline.

101
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:06,579
Rym: Yeah problem is if we boycott all those stores We can't buy things like floor mats or yeah, and all the stores pretty much have the same deal.

102
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:17,136
Rym: Yeah, and Walmart is definitely above and beyond in the worst department though Apparently according to my mom who lives in Arizona someone's running these like super anti Walmart ads on television.

103
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:17,858
Rym: good for them.

104
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,332
Scott: Yeah Now people freaking know but they're gonna still gonna go there because they're freaking dumbasses.

105
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:29,854
Scott: Okay, or because it's a town where there's no more Stores or because they're so poor they can't afford to go anywhere else.

106
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:30,477
Rym: Yeah.

107
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:30,698
Rym: Yeah.

108
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:35,633
Scott: So Adobe, you know bought macromedia a long time ago.

109
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,699
Scott: Yeah today they finished buying them.

110
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:45,123
Scott: So now if you go to macromedia.com, you see the red a up in the top left and it's kind of scary Great.

111
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,666
Rym: So what's flash called now?

112
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:58,700
Scott: It's still called macromedia flash, but we can look forward to in the future is a Single plug-in type thing that encompasses the HTML and the PDFs in the flash and everything.

113
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:09,160
Scott: It's a one one plug-in to rule them all and in the darkness bind them and you can look forward to like You know getting Photoshop and flash in like a bundle and stuff like that.

114
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:11,519
Rym: I think we can look forward to paying more money, too.

115
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:14,957
Scott: You're definitely gonna be looking forward to paying more money because this company.

116
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:19,939
Scott: basically You know, this is basically three categories of software that I see in all four.

117
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,551
Scott: There's four categories of software in terms of price.

118
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:24,099
Scott: There's open source free stuff.

119
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:27,450
Scott: There's the little cheapy bits like, you know, you buy five dollars.

120
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,938
Scott: it you know staples right $50 at staples.

121
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:34,833
Scott: Then is the big packages like Adobe and macromedia and stuff.

122
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:37,986
Scott: and then there's the enterprise stuff Which doesn't have a price cuz you

123
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:38,287
Rym: yeah,

124
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:44,980
Scott: it's like Oracle you pay a zillion dollars doesn't matter Adobe pretty much that was a monopoly on that third level of software

125
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:52,079
Rym: Yep, and they seem to buy up things that are in the category down and then put them in that high category and run the old company out of business.

126
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,836
Scott: Yeah, that's always easy because one way to put these guys out of business is you know Photoshop.

127
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:58,679
Scott: you have the gimp.

128
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,265
Scott: the gimp is free But Photoshop is like $500.

129
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:05,035
Scott: Yeah, the gimp can almost do everything Photoshop does.

130
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:06,680
Rym: there's no free flash.

131
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,363
Scott: Yeah A lot of people.

132
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:15,560
Scott: what they do is they make a program that does almost everything or everything that Photoshop does and as good as the third level software.

133
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:19,339
Scott: But it only cost them a little bit and they sell it on the second level.

134
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,520
Rym: So Adobe of course goes around and buys them up and yep, I don't know if any of you remember a program called cool edit.

135
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:27,333
Scott: Yeah, there were a bunch of other ones too.

136
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:30,728
Rym: Yeah Yeah, there's an awesome awesome program.

137
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:33,720
Rym: It was cheap and it did a good job of manipulating audio.

138
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:50,360
Rym: They bought it and they're selling the same product for almost an order of magnitude more money Though someone in the forum pointed out today or yesterday or whenever there was posted that uh My diet or what I eat is scientifically back to be the healthy way to live.

139
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:54,760
Scott: So there's a New York Times article that you know supported this a long time ago.

140
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:55,402
Scott: I mean like.

141
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:57,511
Scott: I just knew it like intuitively.

142
00:09:57,672 --> 00:09:59,459
Scott: In fact, it's called intuitive dieting, isn't it?

143
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,666
Rym: Yeah, it is.

144
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:05,100
Scott: and then the New York Times came out with an article I love it because like there are things that I kind of know.

145
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:09,920
Scott: You know and I know because I know the stuff that contradicts it is wrong.

146
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:10,743
Scott: But I don't.

147
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:15,120
Scott: I never have evidence that I'm right except for the fact that everything else anyone has said I know is wrong.

148
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:25,319
Scott: And then I'll find an article on Google News that says Scott was right and I'll be like, yeah They see I was right again and it happened in the New York Times, but now it happened again double-plus

149
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:38,179
Rym: yep, basically all that all the studies say is that the best way to be healthy and to not be obese and or to lose Weight is to eat everything you crave whenever you crave it and if you're not hungry don't eat.

150
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:46,185
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty confident that anyone who's not fat because of genetic reasons or glandular problems is Simply they eat when they're not hungry.

151
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:53,729
Rym: or actually a lot of people really really underestimate the number of calories They eat all but some of them don't even think about.

152
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:57,020
Scott: they don't even have a good like number in their head.

153
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,231
Scott: They don't understand how many calories equals how much fatness is.

154
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:02,740
Scott: how many you're supposed to eat is how many is in the food?

155
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,428
Scott: They just it just to see your numbers.

156
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:05,234
Scott: They don't understand it.

157
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:06,119
Scott: They don't even think about it.

158
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,680
Rym: Well, I did see a study a while ago of people who were obese and who were dieting and counting calories.

159
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:21,620
Rym: And they were supposed to they eat they eat but they catalog what they eat and then they calculate the calories and they keep it To you know, fifteen hundred two thousand calories a day, whatever and they were still gaining weight.

160
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:33,020
Rym: So then the scientists had observers follow them around and independently And properly count how many calories they were eating and they were underestimating by an order of magnitude.

161
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:38,697
Rym: They were eating thousands upon thousands more calories than they thought they were just because they didn't calculate properly.

162
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:39,540
Rym: They said no idea.

163
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,320
Scott: Well, I mean if you're dumb enough to eat when you're not hungry, you're dumb enough to not be able to do math.

164
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,324
Scott: Yeah, I Don't know.

165
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:48,531
Scott: I was always cuz.

166
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:49,537
Scott: I knew that you know.

167
00:11:49,577 --> 00:11:56,180
Scott: my whole life I've been eating all kinds of crap foods and every healthy foods ate like steaks and chocolates and whatever the hell.

168
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,743
Scott: I never thought about health food and health food always tasted bad and I said screw that crap It's not see whatever I crave.

169
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,068
Rym: I mean when I was a kid I craved dr.

170
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:10,102
Rym: Pepper and I drank, you know Eat whatever.

171
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:13,171
Scott: I wanted then to live long and eat health food.

172
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:13,713
Scott: I didn't want.

173
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:15,800
Scott: so then, you know, I never turned fat.

174
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:19,140
Scott: So I was like and then I saw fat people and I was like, huh?

175
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,972
Scott: Other than like eating McDonald's or something.

176
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,479
Scott: That's crazy makes you fat.

177
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,646
Scott: What the hell's going on here?

178
00:12:26,988 --> 00:12:27,831
Rym: Well, you know, it's scary.

179
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:36,376
Rym: when I was in like elementary school I remember there was there was one fat kid in the whole school Like one and ever ever made fun of him and it was kind of sad.

180
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:37,180
Rym: I felt bad for him.

181
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,160
Rym: There was like the token fat kid.

182
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:43,150
Rym: Now I walk past elementary school and they're all fat.

183
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,116
Rym: Yeah, like every other kid.

184
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:46,562
Scott: I Don't know.

185
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:53,760
Scott: I see when I was in elementary school There was one kid who was large, but he was generic genetically large like we could sit on his lap.

186
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:01,671
Scott: He was so large and there was another kid who was it was like fat, but he wasn't fat like Blob you fat he was blood.

187
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,620
Scott: He was like a big guy like hey, what's up?

188
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:05,599
Scott: Jolly kind of fat.

189
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:15,860
Scott: There weren't any really like slobbily fat guys in my school But like, you know in high school, there were a few of them that walked around the building.

190
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,955
Scott: I guess I'm not from a big fat area You know, but I see these people in the street.

191
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:24,088
Scott: No, I see them all over the place.

192
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,459
Rym: I gotta get by him in the tiny hallways in the factory at work.

193
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:28,906
Scott: Yeah, they're no fat.

194
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,855
Scott: Is there any fat people at my work?

195
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,631
Scott: I Don't think we really hire fat people.

196
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:34,859
Rym: You hired the chain chomp.

197
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:36,909
Scott: That's an old lady.

198
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,079
Scott: I think she's been there for a long time.

199
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:40,728
Scott: Yeah, she has scary teeth.

200
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:42,418
Scott: That's why they call it the chain chomp.

201
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:49,976
Scott: so Tomorrow Google is expected to release Google Calendar.

202
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:54,025
Scott: Ooh No, you know Okay, cool.

203
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,711
Scott: Google new thing, whatever.

204
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:57,839
Scott: I don't understand the whole calendar thing.

205
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,986
Rym: Some people use calendars.

206
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,090
Rym: I don't I don't.

207
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:02,435
Scott: what would he would?

208
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,800
Scott: can you not remember what you're doing?

209
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,523
Scott: Are you doing?

210
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:16,279
Scott: if you're a guy who does so many things that you need a calendar to keep track of like every hour every day because you have a meeting and then a Presentation and then a trip and then an office and then who knows if you need to do that?

211
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,910
Scott: You're big enough and important enough to have someone who does it for you.

212
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,015
Rym: Yeah, though.

213
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:22,420
Rym: I can see it from a business sense.

214
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:27,545
Rym: I mean I use my calendar at work exclusive extensively Because people will.

215
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:34,890
Rym: just I have meetings scheduled all the time all over the place in weird places with weird people And I don't even care enough to remember where to go.

216
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,899
Rym: Yeah, so it's just every day I look in my calendar and says oh I have to meet this guy this time this guy this time.

217
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:45,957
Rym: But every company that does that gives you some sort of calendaring thing.

218
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:46,599
Rym: Mm-hmm.

219
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,849
Rym: So I really like Yahoo calendar.

220
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,793
Rym: a lot of people use it.

221
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:51,320
Rym: I don't yeah.

222
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,126
Scott: I mean like I could see calendar.

223
00:14:54,186 --> 00:15:01,414
Scott: the only use I would have for a calendar is like some sort of event notification like a Page I could go to to look at.

224
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:03,585
Scott: that would say Here are the things that are.

225
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:07,320
Scott: I could click on a day or a time and it would tell me if there's anything cool happening.

226
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:11,058
Scott: It's like I could turn on my blackberry and be like, is there anything cool I can go to?

227
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:11,400
Scott: right now?

228
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,180
Scott: Here's where I'm at and it would say yeah, there's a cool happening.

229
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,456
Scott: You might like over here, but I don't need a whole calendar application for that.

230
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:19,360
Rym: Yeah, we don't.

231
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,320
Scott: I just need something where I put in the position and the date and time and it gives me a list of events.

232
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:28,600
Rym: Like we don't need something to tell us Otakon's coming up because we're thinking about Otakon now.

233
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:40,728
Scott: yeah, and I don't need something to tell me how to do my everyday stuff because Every day is pretty much almost the same, you know, and I do whatever I want, you know I just go to work do work come home.

234
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,915
Scott: Do what I want go back to work.

235
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,580
Rym: Yeah, well that takes me off.

236
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,855
Rym: I miss the college days where I did crazy difference every day.

237
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:54,880
Scott: I did a different crazy thing Yeah, but even then I learned my schedule I memorized it and like inside of the week and then nine weeks I had it memorized.

238
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:58,793
Rym: Like every day was different and it was real easy to skip classes.

239
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:05,590
Scott: Oh, yeah, I can't skip work But I don't know why.

240
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,199
Scott: can't people remember what they're supposed to do?

241
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:08,484
Rym: I don't know.

242
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:10,658
Rym: Maybe the life hackers should help them out.

243
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:11,704
Scott: I don't know.

244
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:12,869
Scott: a lot of those life hackers.

245
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,054
Scott: half the stuff they do is Randy.

246
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:17,326
Rym: Yeah, it's just kind of silly Mm-hmm.

247
00:16:17,346 --> 00:16:19,920
Scott: Oh, I'm sure a lot of people use the Google Calendar.

248
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,944
Scott: It'll let people.

249
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:24,540
Scott: at least let people share what they're doing so you could look and see what your friends doing.

250
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:27,440
Rym: But yeah, but I don't like that for the same reason.

251
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:55,513
Rym: I don't like LiveJournal, but I'm not hating on it because a lot of people we know use LiveJournal, but basically, what I've seen is that a lot of people I know who have a LiveJournal if You like if you fall out of contact with them and you don't talk to them every day like you used to Instead of talking to them to find out what they're doing They just they post everything their LiveJournal and you can be friends with someone for years after you stop talking to them And you'll still know exactly what they're up to and they'll know what you're up to.

252
00:16:55,573 --> 00:17:00,745
Rym: but you never talk anymore And when you talk to each other you have nothing to say Mm-hmm.

253
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:01,509
Rym: I don't like that.

254
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:03,360
Scott: I'm not a fan of LiveJournal.

255
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,869
Rym: In fact, I make a point of not reading people's LiveJournals.

256
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:08,154
Scott: I won't read.

257
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:09,859
Scott: Oh, it's not LiveJournal the system.

258
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,210
Scott: That's a problem, but I won't read a LiveJournal.

259
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:18,680
Scott: if there's a thing that happens to be on the LiveJournal system I don't care, but I won't read a LiveJournal the way other people do though.

260
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,776
Rym: Actually, it leaves a lot of interesting conversations.

261
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:23,192
Rym: I call a friend I haven't talked to in a long time like hey, what's up?

262
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:28,852
Rym: And they say oh Read my LiveJournal and I say I don't what even up to.

263
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:34,745
Rym: and then they talk to me for an hour instead of just you Know, I don't know hanging up Sending me a link to their LiveJournal.

264
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:37,795
Scott: Yeah, I just don't call people unless I have something to say to them.

265
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:39,320
Rym: Hey there quagmire.

266
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,039
Rym: Hey, what you doing?

267
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:48,065
Scott: Nothing you called me Mm-hmm.

268
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:51,668
Rym: Granted I do that a lot.

269
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:53,580
Rym: I actually talk on the phone quite a bit woman.

270
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:55,503
Rym: Yeah, what can I say?

271
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:57,429
Rym: I'm very European woman.

272
00:17:57,449 --> 00:17:59,214
Rym: I'm very continental European guys.

273
00:17:59,254 --> 00:17:59,796
Scott: Don't do that.

274
00:17:59,816 --> 00:18:00,839
Scott: Hey there hate to tell you.

275
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:13,054
Rym: Actually according to a lot of studies they have tests of you know masculinity and femininity and the American idea of masculinity is Far different from the European idea.

276
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:14,160
Scott: Oh, of course, of course.

277
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,160
Scott: But European guys still don't just call other European guys and say hey what you doing?

278
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:25,120
Rym: Actually, they do not a lot but more often than Americans who seem to avoid any contact with other males.

279
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,524
Rym: That doesn't involve drinking or sports.

280
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:31,619
Scott: Yeah, that's some but you know, not all and we're seeing that change.

281
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:35,233
Scott: a Lot of people are hanging it out doing all kinds of other stuff.

282
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:38,087
Scott: Well, at least geeks are well At least the Internet's bringing them together.

283
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:58,635
Rym: Yeah, but all the people who aren't on the internet boat Yep, all right.

284
00:18:58,895 --> 00:18:59,836
Rym: So my thing of the day.

285
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:03,099
Rym: I found this last week and I've been keeping it until now.

286
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,394
Rym: I Found this video of a dancing puppet skeleton.

287
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:12,559
Rym: It's some good puppeting it's just it's a little puppet and it's really really emotive and realistic.

288
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:26,329
Rym: and the funniest part is when he looks into the little Donation hat and doesn't see any money in there and starts crying and then some lady gives him some money and then he's a little dance Whoo There's really not much more I can say about it.

289
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,912
Rym: It's awesome.

290
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:27,515
Rym: Follow the link.

291
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:30,098
Scott: Mm-hmm my thing of the day.

292
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,200
Scott: So remember you were looking for some slippers recently.

293
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:37,100
Scott: I was eventually were complaining that every store only had one type of slippery.

294
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:43,660
Rym: Yeah, every store had like 50 million kinds of slippers for women and in the men's section of one ugly moccasin looking thing.

295
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:45,728
Scott: Yeah, you finally found some though.

296
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:47,253
Rym: Yeah, I paid too much actually.

297
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:48,337
Rym: No, I didn't find some.

298
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:54,638
Rym: no My girlfriend's father gave me some That he happened to have lying around.

299
00:19:55,561 --> 00:20:03,233
Scott: awesome, but well if you would have waited until today you would have found out that that company that makes the Cthulhu plushie toys.

300
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:10,659
Rym: No way plushie slipper HP Lovecraft is spinning in his grave tentacles to keep your feet warm.

301
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:12,450
Rym: How much are they?

302
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,155
Rym: 30 bucks?

303
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:13,980
Rym: That's pretty badass.

304
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:16,516
Scott: Oh, oh, it's out of stock.

305
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:23,276
Rym: Great I guess I think today didn't beat park slash dot whoever the hell found it before we did.

306
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:33,784
Scott: Yeah Well, I'm sure you'll see them at your next gaming convention game store where they sell your Plushie products.

307
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:36,834
Rym: Yeah, probably overpriced as those things tend to be.

308
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:37,617
Rym: but what are you gonna do?

309
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,305
Rym: Yeah Considering that we have a kid.

310
00:20:40,385 --> 00:20:45,400
Scott: It looks like to be the same quality as the actual plushie toy, which is high quality.

311
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,272
Scott: Yeah, only I think the plushie toy was 40 bucks.

312
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:50,180
Scott: So this being 30 and you get two of them.

313
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:51,444
Scott: That's pretty good.

314
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:54,676
Rym: But we have a lot of high quality weird plushies like that.

315
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:55,499
Rym: You wouldn't expect us.

316
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,789
Rym: We got the Cactuar.

317
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,331
Scott: Yep.

318
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:00,320
Scott: Well, it's it's all about the high quality plushie.

319
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,285
Rym: So moving on from our main bit.

320
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:15,436
Scott: It's time for another edition of how not to suck.

321
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:17,839
Scott: how not to suck at money.

322
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:31,839
Rym: Oh the greens the gold the Platinum's the doubloons the rupees Yeah, so Scott found an article that he'll talk about in a minute.

323
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:39,671
Rym: and Basically, we discovered that despite the fact that from my perception I piss money away on stupid things on a regular basis

324
00:21:39,872 --> 00:21:41,779
Scott: and I buy freaking every video game I see

325
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:47,660
Rym: I just head down to the city on a train like all the time and eat food out constantly.

326
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:53,805
Scott: I drive places when I know it'd be cheaper to take a train or vice versa and Buy food.

327
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:54,850
Scott: just yeah.

328
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,100
Scott: Yeah, I know that vending machines a ripoff, but I don't care.

329
00:21:57,361 --> 00:22:06,375
Rym: We had two expensive dinners in two days over the weekend, and I'm still just fine Yep, but apparently a lot of people really really suck at dealing with money.

330
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:08,720
Scott: Uh Just about everybody.

331
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,446
Scott: So I read this article.

332
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:18,800
Scott: I think it was business week or some other one of those magazines I don't really remember because I didn't go to work today where it was in the bathroom.

333
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:20,949
Rym: Yeah, you found it in the bathroom in the bathroom.

334
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:23,700
Scott: They replaced the nice Forza magazine with the Ferraris in it.

335
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,787
Scott: I'm kind of upset, but anyway Hey, we're talking about how.

336
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:30,420
Scott: you know people are having a hard time these days with debt.

337
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:33,905
Scott: You know they go to school they get these student loans.

338
00:22:34,406 --> 00:22:35,568
Scott: You know then they have to pay 200 $300 a month.

339
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:42,099
Scott: You know their jobs don't pay so much They're just pay more than ours.

340
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:46,170
Scott: And You know and and these people?

341
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:57,414
Scott: it said that the average credit card debt For people between the ages of 24 and 34 25 and 35 or something around there was fifty four hundred dollars.

342
00:22:57,675 --> 00:23:06,399
Scott: good god now They gave examples of people and the first example was a lady who made sixty thirty year old lady who made sixty thousand dollars a year.

343
00:23:07,742 --> 00:23:10,032
Scott: She had to be three hundred dollars a month for student loans.

344
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:14,479
Scott: her loan was the same size as mine But mine is two hundred a month.

345
00:23:15,642 --> 00:23:20,260
Scott: But I I'll be paid off before I'm 30 if I just make the payments and don't do anything else.

346
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,771
Scott: Yeah, right, and it was like oh if you get a master's degree.

347
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:26,459
Scott: You're screwed even more, but you know not so much.

348
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:35,085
Scott: and Somehow her making let's see 33% more money than me.

349
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:40,880
Scott: and Oh my money plus 50% is how much he makes.

350
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:44,082
Scott: and then Paying less.

351
00:23:44,484 --> 00:23:47,113
Scott: you know about the same amount for student loans and things.

352
00:23:47,374 --> 00:23:49,200
Scott: she has fifty four hundred dollars of credit card debt.

353
00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:50,405
Scott: Where'd that come from?

354
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:52,494
Rym: yeah like what do people spend their money on?

355
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:53,860
Rym: I buy stupid crap?

356
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,178
Rym: I buy anime and just garbage constantly, and I still have plenty of money, and I make far less money than these people.

357
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:06,638
Scott: yeah Well the number one rule of how not to suck with money Don't live above the means.

358
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,644
Rym: Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

359
00:24:08,885 --> 00:24:09,568
Scott: too many people.

360
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:12,157
Scott: they decide on what their level of living is.

361
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:21,871
Scott: you know they say I am a person who lives in a car in a house with four bedrooms in a two-car garage and two SUVs Regardless of how much money they make.

362
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:27,659
Scott: if you do it that way Unless you happen to be making more money than that you know then you're in a big pooper.

363
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:33,480
Scott: Yeah, you got to look at how much money you make and then decide how well you're gonna live.

364
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,312
Scott: You know based on the money.

365
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:48,081
Scott: if you only make 30 G's you got to live a 30 G lifestyle or else you're gonna be poor real real soon Plus just poor decisions in general like say you want an Xbox 360.

366
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:52,959
Rym: If you buy it now you pretty much have to buy the full-on bundle and you're out a whole shit ton of money.

367
00:24:53,564 --> 00:24:53,705
Rym: Mm-hmm.

368
00:24:54,028 --> 00:25:00,239
Rym: if you wait till like February and you buy one You'll probably be better off.

369
00:25:00,963 --> 00:25:03,072
Scott: Yeah, and what are you gonna gain by buying it now?

370
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:08,539
Scott: if you buy it now You'll gain a tiny bit of social currency for like maybe a week or two.

371
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:12,838
Scott: You know people coming to your house to go ooh and a bunch of crap launch games.

372
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:14,707
Scott: of course It might backfire on you.

373
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:15,430
Scott: people might go out.

374
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,259
Scott: Here's the poser trying to get one real quick.

375
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:18,526
Scott: You know what?

376
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:21,460
Scott: what are you really paying if you buy it on eBay for $1,000?

377
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,106
Scott: What is that really doing for you?

378
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:25,696
Rym: You mean you know how many were sold on eBay.

379
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:27,181
Scott: you're paying 800.

380
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:32,760
Scott: You know maybe $600 more than you know what the thing normally costs or what you could buy it for.

381
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:38,657
Scott: You know in a couple months from now Dollars or $800 worth of stuff out of that.

382
00:25:39,901 --> 00:25:41,807
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I mean for 800 bucks.

383
00:25:42,188 --> 00:25:42,930
Rym: I could live it up.

384
00:25:43,973 --> 00:25:45,137
Scott: Oh man for 800 bucks.

385
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:48,425
Scott: Wow Wow, I could buy.

386
00:25:48,987 --> 00:25:54,390
Rym: I'd buy every anime box that I've been waiting for for a long time and every board game I've ever wanted and I'd have a lot money left.

387
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:56,239
Scott: Yeah, I'd gain interest on it in the bank.

388
00:25:58,822 --> 00:25:59,143
Scott: What else?

389
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:00,852
Scott: one of the mistakes do people make with money uh?

390
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,252
Rym: Don't buy a car if you don't need one.

391
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:07,938
Scott: don't buy an SUV.

392
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:17,778
Scott: well Don't buy a car that uses more gas than you can afford or cost more than you can afford And don't drive it if you don't have to.

393
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:19,560
Scott: Like.

394
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:24,076
Scott: you know just because it might be convenient don't drive up and down the road ten times a day.

395
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:25,160
Scott: go all out at once.

396
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:29,809
Scott: You know cuz gas is a lot a lot of money that adds up if you keep using the car.

397
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:36,377
Scott: and You know no matter how much fun you might think the SUV is or how trendy you think you'll be.

398
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:38,859
Scott: guess what you're not gonna Stand out in a sea of SUVs.

399
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:45,220
Scott: It's cheaper to buy a freaking like Ford Mustang sports car and more fuel-efficient than to buy a Ford Explorer.

400
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:49,460
Rym: You can get a freaking Lotus Elis a for not that much money.

401
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:51,894
Scott: Yeah, you can get a Lotus Elis a is 40 G's.

402
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:58,760
Scott: a Ford Explorer I think is 40 G's or maybe 30, but you know it's only like five to ten thousand dollars more.

403
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,655
Scott: But you'll save that money in gas in a year.

404
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:12,200
Scott: if you use the car free Lotus as just a Toyota Celica engine and it weighs nothing You use barely any gas it goes really fast, and you can turn on a dime.

405
00:27:13,162 --> 00:27:19,632
Scott: You can't take anything with you besides you and maybe a passenger Maybe you and a grocery that has more space into the friggin mr.

406
00:27:19,632 --> 00:27:20,234
Rym: 2 spider.

407
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:25,310
Scott: yeah, and if you got a big family You know you can get a minivan even though you'll be uncool.

408
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,178
Scott: Yeah, okay sure you'll be slightly uncool.

409
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:32,294
Scott: is being Uncool is being cooler worth ten thousand dollars.

410
00:27:32,314 --> 00:27:33,219
Rym: I don't know.

411
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:35,812
Rym: yeah I'll tell you what I could buy a ten thousand dollars worth of cool.

412
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:37,360
Rym: That wouldn't include a big car.

413
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,363
Scott: Yeah, think about this.

414
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:43,160
Scott: if you buy a minivan instead of an SUV right you can get all those fancy minivan features like.

415
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,311
Scott: it Has little TV players in there and stuff right.

416
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:47,019
Scott: you'll still save 10 G's.

417
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:51,660
Scott: You can use the 10 G's to buy a projector in your house in a home theater, and then you'll be wicked cool.

418
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:57,742
Rym: Like our friend Alex he drives a minivan around and we're always glad when he comes cuz we can all pile into it and go Do geekery.

419
00:27:57,982 --> 00:28:03,356
Scott: yeah, don't be you know a stupid fashion type person buying like you know the $300 jeans or anything.

420
00:28:05,144 --> 00:28:05,325
Scott: You know.

421
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:07,080
Scott: you pay for labels you pay for cool.

422
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:08,676
Scott: You're gonna pay.

423
00:28:09,782 --> 00:28:10,103
Rym: Of course.

424
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:13,040
Rym: one big big thing you can do is you know not have cable TV anymore?

425
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,330
Rym: Yeah, that costs a lot of money.

426
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:16,940
Scott: cable TV does cost a lot of money.

427
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,147
Scott: I mean the family.

428
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:21,488
Scott: a lot of you have the family basic basic plan Which is still $40 a month you know but?

429
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,705
Scott: Anyone who gets more channels than that?

430
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:33,880
Scott: I see people paying a hundred two hundred a month doesn't matter satellite or cable either Yep, and they only watch maybe like one or two channels or they TiVo a bunch of stuff.

431
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,730
Scott: You just get a myth TV.

432
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:43,428
Rym: You don't have to pay the TiVo bill yeah, and Netflix is like less than 20 bucks a month and It's more movies than we'll ever have time to watch.

433
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:49,243
Scott: and the other thing is if you're not spending all your time watching TV Maybe you can spend your time doing other things You know.

434
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:54,378
Scott: maybe make some money or learn some skills that might get you a raise at your job, or you know.

435
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:57,134
Rym: granted I don't think many of our listeners watch much TV anyway.

436
00:28:57,577 --> 00:28:58,684
Rym: That's good You know.

437
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,675
Rym: at least I would assume you know when we were kids.

438
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:01,419
Rym: we watch a lot of TV.

439
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,660
Scott: That's kind of why you know I stopped watching TV when I got to college.

440
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:06,887
Scott: Yeah, that's kind of why podcasts are so great.

441
00:29:06,948 --> 00:29:16,675
Scott: so I can still get some sort of push programmed media But it's interesting and targeted to me And I don't have to actually stop doing what I'm doing on the computer to do it.

442
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,986
Scott: like if I have to visit a web Page I have to stop working.

443
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,740
Scott: podcast goes right through work simultaneous.

444
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:22,484
Scott: I like it.

445
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:24,835
Scott: TV can't do anything.

446
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:29,748
Scott: while you're watching TV I can play like Mario Kart yeah But then you're not really getting the TV at all.

447
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,718
Rym: you're just playing Mario Kart because there's so much to get ever since.

448
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:34,706
Rym: uh You know every good show was cancelled.

449
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:37,798
Rym: Yeah, yeah, the Simpsons is still going.

450
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:40,760
Scott: something else You can get rid of is your home telephone.

451
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:45,818
Scott: Haha, just go for the cell phone alone, and don't have a phone line in your house.

452
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:46,320
Scott: You don't need it.

453
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:50,488
Rym: Yeah, right we haven't had a phone line since college And that's just because they gave us one.

454
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:51,233
Rym: we didn't pay for it.

455
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:54,120
Scott: sure even if you had one Have you used it for years and years and years?

456
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:01,318
Scott: It's only a slight pain in the ass to change it you know and then once you change it You're changed and now you can use your cell phone for everything.

457
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:05,673
Scott: yeah Cell phones definitely cheaper also for the long distance.

458
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:08,763
Scott: if you call anyone far away No gouging.

459
00:30:08,784 --> 00:30:11,920
Rym: I don't think I've ever paid long distance on a phone ever.

460
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,779
Rym: I've had a cell phone pretty much as long as I've used phones for things.

461
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:22,739
Rym: My first cell phone was one of those giant bricks that lasted about 45 minutes if you actually tried to talk on it.

462
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:28,837
Rym: My mom got it for me because she thought it would keep me secure or safe or something in case I ever got in a car accident.

463
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,145
Scott: Mm-hmm.

464
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,682
Rym: I still have it laying around somewhere Mmm.

465
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:42,839
Scott: Oh oh the number one way to save money when you do have to buy things even though they may be expensive is To do lots and lots of research and not be dumb.

466
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:45,572
Rym: Yeah, well that just boils down to.

467
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:48,247
Rym: don't listen to the guy at Best Buy He doesn't know what he's talking about.

468
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:53,408
Scott: yeah like when you go to buy a car Don't buy a car cuz it's cool.

469
00:30:53,468 --> 00:31:03,260
Scott: Don't buy a car because the dealer tells you to do your own Research on the internet and in books and things and what is good for you and decide based on that.

470
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:07,940
Scott: Completely ignore anything superficial like brand and color and whatever.

471
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:10,290
Rym: And well I care about matters.

472
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:13,398
Scott: well, okay, yeah, but You know what I'm saying?

473
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,626
Rym: More importantly be an asshole.

474
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:18,360
Rym: once you find what you want go and get that and don't settle for less.

475
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:19,685
Rym: Yeah, walk into the car.

476
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:22,175
Rym: dealer pointed a car and say give me that one for this price.

477
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,280
Rym: if they say no walk away.

478
00:31:23,702 --> 00:31:24,828
Scott: Yep, no one had.

479
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:26,014
Scott: you don't have to do what anyone says.

480
00:31:26,054 --> 00:31:27,120
Scott: you're the guy with the money.

481
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,027
Scott: You're buying stuff.

482
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:29,720
Scott: if they don't want to sell it to you give them the finger.

483
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:32,089
Scott: You know when you go to buy.

484
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:33,254
Scott: what else is a big purchase?

485
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:36,708
Scott: if you're gonna buy a computer Don't buy a computer from Dell.

486
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:39,136
Scott: don't get the little insurance plans.

487
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:40,960
Scott: don't buy the accessories.

488
00:31:42,143 --> 00:31:43,132
Scott: Just figure you know.

489
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:47,320
Scott: go online Figure out what kind of computer you need and buy the cheapest one you can get.

490
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:53,447
Scott: If you can't build one your own you can still get someone to build one for you, or you know I mean you're geeks.

491
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:55,060
Rym: you got to know a geek who can build a computer.

492
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:59,540
Scott: Yeah, I mean like I look on Dell comm and I see a computer for like a thousand dollars.

493
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:05,254
Scott: I could build it for three hundred dollars And it would be better and faster, and you'd never need to upgrade it ever.

494
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:09,718
Scott: you know that thousand dollar Dell is missing pieces never upgraded ever.

495
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:13,014
Scott: eh Well, I guess if you didn't want to play games.

496
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:14,140
Scott: You wouldn't have to upgrade it ever.

497
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:17,311
Rym: Grant I'm still running a freaking Thunderbird gigahertz.

498
00:32:17,332 --> 00:32:18,216
Scott: yeah see there you go.

499
00:32:18,276 --> 00:32:19,745
Rym: is the last game I cared about?

500
00:32:19,786 --> 00:32:21,620
Rym: they came out was counter-strike.

501
00:32:22,162 --> 00:32:27,437
Scott: Oh speaking of games don't play a game with any sort of subscription service or get addicted to anything.

502
00:32:27,598 --> 00:32:31,290
Scott: well specifically Yeah, well those are the games you can get addicted to.

503
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,515
Scott: don't do drugs either.

504
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,860
Scott: drugs will take away all your money.

505
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,990
Rym: Yeah, I remember the the geeky fable about Duane.

506
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:37,356
Rym: Yeah, I don't want to be Duane.

507
00:32:37,436 --> 00:32:43,222
Scott: Yeah Anything that addicts people I mean even like Farc.

508
00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:45,349
Scott: well FARC doesn't cost money.

509
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:49,243
Rym: well as it does you pay or cost money if you lose your job because all you do is Read FARC.

510
00:32:49,263 --> 00:32:50,652
Scott: Yeah, well don't pay for FARC.

511
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:51,920
Scott: I guess you're not paying for it.

512
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,791
Rym: That's a lot of people pay for total FARC.

513
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:59,031
Rym: Yeah, it's probably not a good idea Now if you have trouble Closing your web browser now.

514
00:32:59,514 --> 00:33:02,020
Rym: Don't get total FARC He'll just sit there until you starve.

515
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:05,434
Scott: He has a good example of when to know to pay for something and when not to let.

516
00:33:05,475 --> 00:33:07,728
Scott: I played puzzle pirates when it was Like beta and free.

517
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,260
Scott: cuz I hear free and I like pirates.

518
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:11,610
Scott: Yeah, it was a good game And I had some funny fun puzzles in.

519
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,180
Scott: it wasn't like an MMO where you level up.

520
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,794
Scott: It was just puzzles all right and money collection, but you can get money so easily.

521
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,220
Scott: it wasn't even like a contest.

522
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:20,306
Scott: And then it was.

523
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:22,899
Scott: they said pay 50 bucks for like two three years.

524
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:24,167
Scott: So I'm like all right.

525
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:28,508
Scott: 50 bucks is what I usually pay for a video game And I usually play a video game for maybe a year.

526
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:31,759
Scott: if not if not even like a few months all right.

527
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:33,730
Scott: So 50 bucks for three years.

528
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,018
Scott: That's like a freaking deal.

529
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:42,180
Scott: It's I paid for it And then it ran out and I stopped playing long before it ran out as I expected and I stopped playing.

530
00:33:42,923 --> 00:33:44,790
Scott: If an MMO was like pay $50 a year.

531
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:50,410
Scott: I'd be like no Because the formula of that is a dick to you.

532
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:51,213
Scott: and take your money.

533
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:53,141
Scott: take your money take your money take your money take your Money.

534
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:56,920
Rym: yep, they do that with talk with total FARC - cuz I had FARC.

535
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:03,198
Rym: I read FARC a lot more than I should I post on it a lot and one day someone sponsored me for total FARC.

536
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:10,034
Rym: some Total Farker must have liked me enough or hated me enough to spend money to give me total FARC for a month.

537
00:34:10,335 --> 00:34:13,808
Rym: Wow oh my god There were just a million.

538
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:18,130
Rym: I basically was infinite entertainment Infinite news constantly.

539
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,060
Rym: it was a sea of updating.

540
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:26,426
Scott: So not only will that take away your job, but and your money Hey, it just ruined you.

541
00:34:26,446 --> 00:34:35,775
Scott: yeah Wow No really yeah really Volcano look yeah, don't spend your time making photoshops, and you're supposed to be working anything.

542
00:34:36,277 --> 00:34:39,279
Rym: Yeah quiet I thought my Asian bird flu haha guy was hilarious.

543
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:42,607
Rym: Maybe.

544
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:50,675
Scott: oh Another good way not to lose money is It's okay to have like you know a hobby, but don't get into a hobby.

545
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:53,926
Scott: That's like collecting Expensive useless things.

546
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,373
Scott: I know a lot of people.

547
00:34:55,474 --> 00:34:55,956
Scott: you know where.

548
00:34:56,138 --> 00:35:06,800
Scott: otherwise They're just perfectly good people, but they have an infinite number of like PVC robots Yeah, or they'll spend their time collecting comic books, and they'll go and they'll spend like a thousand dollars for comic book.

549
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,770
Scott: You know it's like all right.

550
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:13,920
Scott: I understand You know collecting you want to have a nice collection, and you know show it off, and it makes you feel good.

551
00:35:14,682 --> 00:35:24,144
Scott: But when it comes to something like you know a statue Well you can just get the replica of the statue or the look thing that looks the same and does the same things But isn't the original?

552
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:30,852
Scott: for much less you know and no one will know or care except you Just get over it and you can save yourself a freaking fortune.

553
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:33,040
Rym: Yeah, or be like our friend Scott Johnson.

554
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:35,008
Rym: Yeah, I mean you a video game.

555
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:35,871
Rym: some of them are good enough.

556
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:39,366
Rym: you buy them on opening day like they come out and you Immediately take how many beat it.

557
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:40,250
Scott: that's usually just cuz.

558
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:47,200
Scott: I have no other games left and when a new one comes out I can go get it, but most games wait and buy him in the discount bin for like five bucks.

559
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:54,016
Rym: Say with anime our friend Scott Johnson every time we go to a convention We we all leave with you know we go to the dealer's room.

560
00:35:54,036 --> 00:35:54,640
Rym: We buy crap.

561
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:58,780
Rym: He'll leave with like 50 DVDs and a giant sack of crap.

562
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:06,185
Rym: And then we ask him how much he spent and it's almost nothing because he pretty much just rooted around in bargain bins and bought Yesterday's hotness.

563
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:08,373
Scott: yep, I mean he gets you know.

564
00:36:08,393 --> 00:36:14,659
Scott: you look at the individual deals there And it's like you know get five for the price of three, and you're like all right.

565
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:27,500
Scott: But when he keeps going around getting every single deal starting from the best going to like you know like a limit And then when you look at the sum total, it's like he got 60% off the total price of things.

566
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:33,057
Rym: It's like wow granted the drawback of that is we were subjected to some bad anime as a result of him.

567
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:35,671
Scott: Yeah What was that one called?

568
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:35,732
Scott: Oh?

569
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,204
Scott: God Super Atrogan, I was okay Was he?

570
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:43,709
Scott: definitely I could have done without it.

571
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,117
Scott: Yes wasn't a bad anime though.

572
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:52,608
Scott: anyway Don't give your money to homeless people on the street.

573
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,935
Rym: don't give your money to a Scientologists.

574
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:56,340
Scott: Yeah, don't join a cult.

575
00:36:57,122 --> 00:36:59,290
Scott: Don't give your money to wacky religion.

576
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:07,218
Scott: Don't give your money to pretty much anything unless You you're getting something out of it, or you know it's you know a charity.

577
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:07,680
Scott: That's good.

578
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,873
Rym: Yeah, like if you're gonna give to a charity give to like the Red Cross.

579
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:12,500
Rym: Yeah, don't give to the United Way.

580
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:17,860
Rym: Yeah, well actually get into that some other podcast, but Red Cross good United Way bad.

581
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,843
Rym: You don't deserve.

582
00:37:19,144 --> 00:37:20,469
Rym: okay UNICEF's all right.

583
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,340
Scott: if you're gonna give money to like something like Child's Play, right?

584
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,716
Scott: You know it's good to give the Child's Play or Red Cross, but don't give more than you got.

585
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:32,594
Rym: yeah You know like actually the worst thing to give your money to is the Salvation Army.

586
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:34,260
Scott: Yeah, Salvation Army very bad.

587
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:46,979
Rym: They spend most of their money on administrative garbage and paying their own employees And they spend the rest buying various religious implements to convert people Like they'll go to a starving African village and bring Bibles instead of food.

588
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:52,780
Rym: That's not cool not cool at all and there's nothing to do with the fact that it's Christian.

589
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:56,298
Rym: I mean they could be bringing anything other than food, and I'd be equally pissed.

590
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,936
Scott: yep Let's See what all the things do people spend their money on.

591
00:38:01,956 --> 00:38:02,419
Scott: that's dumb.

592
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,718
Rym: Yeah, do I just turn them to a list of things that are dumb to spend money on because that's pretty much everything.

593
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,718
Scott: yeah Oh, well, here's here's a good thing.

594
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,571
Scott: Don't get a loan for something.

595
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:14,140
Scott: That's just like stupid.

596
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,424
Rym: Okay, great advice there.

597
00:38:17,006 --> 00:38:17,227
Scott: Well.

598
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:18,089
Scott: You know a lot of people.

599
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:25,500
Scott: they go and like you know they've already got a loan here And they've already got a mortgage there And you know and then they want to make like addition to their house.

600
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,405
Scott: So they get another loan.

601
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:28,216
Scott: just leave without the freaking addition.

602
00:38:28,256 --> 00:38:28,880
Scott: you can't afford it.

603
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,073
Rym: You've already got a loan or maybe you can't afford it, and then you get it.

604
00:38:32,776 --> 00:38:33,880
Rym: It's just live within your means.

605
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,254
Scott: It's that simple yeah, but specifically with loans because they have the big interest.

606
00:38:38,635 --> 00:38:42,492
Scott: if you get a lot of money You know you want to pay off that.

607
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:45,790
Scott: you know the loan real quick Faster if you know than it's supposed to be.

608
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:49,085
Scott: if you don't pay a crap ton of interest a lot of times They'll trick you with those payments.

609
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:57,127
Scott: You know and a lot of people aren't quick enough to realize oh The interest adds up to like you know $5,000 over.

610
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,333
Rym: well the worst thing you can do.

611
00:38:58,433 --> 00:39:04,359
Rym: or like there are lower loans And then there are negative amortization loans, and then there are balloon loans.

612
00:39:05,062 --> 00:39:06,327
Rym: And basically these are loans.

613
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:09,599
Rym: well you'll owe more at the end than you did at the start.

614
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:16,018
Rym: Loans where you have a low monthly payment, and then after two years you suddenly owe a one-time payment of like 20 grand.

615
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:19,219
Rym: Yeah, because you weren't paying down the interest.

616
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:24,831
Rym: Mm-hmm Money-making schemes are all BS, but you know that.

617
00:39:25,192 --> 00:39:37,419
Rym: yeah if anyone says you know you can get rich quick You'd think oh, that's obvious don't fall for a money-making scheme, but we've had a lot of Fairly smart friends put money into stupid stupid things.

618
00:39:37,861 --> 00:39:40,514
Scott: Mm-hmm I fell for a money-making scheme in middle school once.

619
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:42,282
Scott: oh really well It was just.

620
00:39:42,403 --> 00:39:45,120
Scott: it was contest to win a bunch of games called pandemonium.

621
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,764
Scott: Uh-huh.

622
00:39:45,785 --> 00:40:01,795
Scott: and they put an advertisement in the video game magazine That was that showed like a giant TV and every video game system and a giant stereo And it looked freaking out and a satellite dish and everything and all you had to do to enter the contest Was send in this little puzzle that was in the magazine, and it was the simplest puzzle ever.

623
00:40:01,815 --> 00:40:04,958
Scott: and I said all right I sent it in with free.

624
00:40:05,941 --> 00:40:09,139
Scott: then they sent me a thing back and said fill out this puzzle and send us a dollar.

625
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:18,740
Scott: and I said and they're like there are five puzzles And I calculated the increase in difficulty of the puzzle that this one wasn't so much more difficult than the previous one.

626
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:20,625
Scott: So I'm like all right.

627
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:21,569
Scott: It's only a dollar.

628
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,614
Scott: if the next one sucks.

629
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,812
Scott: I won't send it again, right What's it gonna cost?

630
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:25,319
Scott: five bucks?

631
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,182
Scott: Yeah, the next one came and these people were so good and I was such an impressionable middle school kid that It was.

632
00:40:32,586 --> 00:40:34,320
Scott: it was harder, and I felt like it was harder.

633
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,900
Scott: But I was smart enough to figure it out because I was a smart guy and it was five bucks.

634
00:40:38,484 --> 00:40:40,800
Scott: So I'm like yeah five bucks whatever who cares all right?

635
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:40,981
Scott: What?

636
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:45,373
Scott: I didn't have anything to spend five bucks on in those days except like a pack of Magic cards Which were also a ripoff?

637
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:47,425
Scott: It wasn't safe.

638
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:48,370
Scott: It wasn't waste any money.

639
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,134
Scott: those other waste money.

640
00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:50,299
Scott: They're wasting money somewhere else.

641
00:40:51,261 --> 00:40:59,700
Scott: So they sent me the fourth one which is really freaking hard But I finally got it after like many hours and help from people and they said send ten bucks.

642
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,247
Scott: So I'm like there's only one more.

643
00:41:01,288 --> 00:41:02,473
Scott: how much could the last one be?

644
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,820
Rym: was the last one a hundred dollars?

645
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:04,725
Scott: No, it wasn't.

646
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:07,320
Scott: the last one is 15 bucks, right?

647
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,668
Scott: So they got 15 plus 10 plus 5 plus 1 so 25 30 31 dollars.

648
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,519
Scott: I sent them which is not so bad, but the last puzzle pretty much.

649
00:41:16,982 --> 00:41:19,213
Scott: they said they had a big open square.

650
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:37,957
Scott: it was just a grid and They had point values assigned to letters of the alphabet all the letters of the alphabet And you had to completely fill this grid right with words in every single possible direction filling every single square and I think it was like a 10 by 10 grid and you also had to get the highest possible score.

651
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:45,178
Scott: and Oh, so I filled out the whole thing using as many Z words as I could because I think it was.

652
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:49,342
Scott: I think Z was A big one and like Q is a big one, you know I take it.

653
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,208
Rym: you didn't win the amazing pile of awesome.

654
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,256
Scott: Do I have an amazing pile of awesome?

655
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:54,400
Rym: No, you do not.

656
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:55,353
Scott: Do I have a neogeo?

657
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:01,296
Scott: Have an original game boy to have a Sega Saturn to have an original game boy.

658
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:01,978
Scott: Do I have a 3do?

659
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,542
Scott: I have?

660
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:07,260
Scott: no I have never known anyone who had none of these things are things that I have?

661
00:42:07,682 --> 00:42:15,712
Scott: I don't have a 50 inch rear projection TV in a satellite dish and a 5,000 watt stereo or anything because it was a scam.

662
00:42:15,953 --> 00:42:16,574
Rym: good game.

663
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:17,317
Scott: Yep.

664
00:42:17,377 --> 00:42:18,420
Scott: I never fell for a scam again.

665
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:22,640
Rym: I had a couple of friends in high school who fell for this Amway scam.

666
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:28,300
Rym: We did one of those thick abs where you sell crap on a website that you buy from someone else.

667
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,626
Rym: It's not really a pyramid scheme.

668
00:42:29,988 --> 00:42:30,269
Rym: It's just.

669
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,640
Rym: it's a direct marketing crap.

670
00:42:32,861 --> 00:42:36,296
Scott: Yeah, anyone who says that you can make money by selling their stuff.

671
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,200
Scott: That's a scam.

672
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:40,720
Rym: Anyone who says you can make money and doesn't offer you an hourly wage is a scam.

673
00:42:41,021 --> 00:42:50,087
Scott: Yeah, you know those pieces of paper you see hanging there like, you know big money work from home You know Thousands of dollars.

674
00:42:50,127 --> 00:42:51,132
Scott: that's all scams.

675
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:52,619
Scott: every single last one of them.

676
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:54,587
Scott: There's not a single one.

677
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:55,231
Scott: That is not a scam.

678
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:56,660
Rym: Don't forget Nigerian scams.

679
00:42:57,182 --> 00:42:59,834
Scott: Oh, I don't think anyone's gonna fall for a Nigerian scam.

680
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:01,240
Rym: a lot of people still fall for them.

681
00:43:01,904 --> 00:43:03,453
Scott: That's like the obvious scam.

682
00:43:03,795 --> 00:43:04,540
Scott: chop your dollar.

683
00:43:08,662 --> 00:43:10,808
Scott: I had to get that in real quick the dollar chopping.

684
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:21,760
Rym: Yeah, so we're sorry if this uh, all this talk of money and Responsibility and crap was boring, but we were just really kind of pissed off about that article.

685
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:25,492
Rym: Yeah, because there's someone who's just like us.

686
00:43:26,134 --> 00:43:27,197
Rym: They make more money.

687
00:43:27,217 --> 00:43:28,160
Scott: They're not geeks though.

688
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:30,797
Rym: Yeah, they're not geeks, but they don't have any dependents.

689
00:43:30,877 --> 00:43:32,505
Rym: No kids No family to take care of.

690
00:43:32,725 --> 00:43:39,006
Rym: they're making a lot more money than us and yet they're somehow Struggling and can't make ends meet.

691
00:43:39,468 --> 00:43:42,760
Rym: that's really an insult to the people in the world who really can't make ends meet.

692
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:44,612
Scott: I know it's like I can't buy food.

693
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:50,633
Scott: Are you so Greedy and and whatnot that you have to have all these fancy things.

694
00:43:50,693 --> 00:43:53,856
Scott: They're whatever you're spending your money on that God.

695
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:56,547
Rym: yeah, God course.

696
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:05,318
Rym: then we have like our one friend who couldn't afford to eat and Then he got all his student loan money and he bought a drum set And then he didn't have any money to eat.

697
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,514
Rym: Yeah, and then a friend of his felt sorry told the story before we did.

698
00:44:09,554 --> 00:44:10,820
Rym: we told that story told that story.

699
00:44:11,122 --> 00:44:12,492
Rym: Ah, did we actually tell her?

700
00:44:12,512 --> 00:44:13,680
Rym: do we tell her one of the beta podcast?

701
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,111
Scott: It might have been in a beta podcast.

702
00:44:15,212 --> 00:44:17,394
Scott: Oh, yeah Don't be that guy either.

703
00:44:17,556 --> 00:44:25,880
Rym: Yeah Well onto a meta bit We do have a bunch of old terrible podcasts that we might publish someday if you guys want to hear them.

704
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:34,729
Rym: Yeah, like when we decided to do a podcast and we took this crap logitech like microphone and stuck it in the middle of The room and real sad on opposite sides of the room.

705
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,417
Scott: It sounds like everyone else's podcast.

706
00:44:36,558 --> 00:44:40,654
Scott: Yeah Doesn't have a mixer or anything fancy completely unedited.

707
00:44:41,035 --> 00:44:42,120
Rym: We screw up a lot.

708
00:44:42,882 --> 00:44:44,548
Scott: It's basically just.

709
00:44:44,669 --> 00:44:44,789
Scott: it's.

710
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:46,335

Scott: Yeah, the rawest raw raw Like meat that's uncooked.

712

713
00:44:57,724 --> 00:44:59,049
Scott: No, there's like a raw steak analogy.

714
00:44:59,069 --> 00:44:59,792
Scott: I used for something.

715
00:45:00,475 --> 00:45:01,419
Rym: No, I don't remember that at all.

716
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:02,502
Scott: Okay.

Scott: You don't let me finish.
