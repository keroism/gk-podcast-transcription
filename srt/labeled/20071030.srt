1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,446
Rym: It's Tuesday, October 30th.

2
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:12,188
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:25,402
Rym: I'm companion to you and this is portal tonight GeekNights Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:32,162
Scott: I Beat that phantom hourglass on the train home today.

5
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:32,847
Rym: Oh, did you?

6
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:39,450
Scott: I did I didn't get anywhere near all this stuff in the game, but you on a scale of one to five minish caps.

7
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,053
Rym: How was it?

8
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:41,841
Scott: Wait one to five minish cap?

9
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:43,549
Scott: Yeah, like a thousand minish caps.

10
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:45,034
Scott: Well, I don't know.

11
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:46,963
Scott: I know I guess minish caps are bad.

12
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:48,510
Scott: So it would be zero minish caps.

13
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:50,217
Rym: Ah, you see it was a trick question.

14
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:51,744
Scott: Yeah, it's good.

15
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:53,230
Scott: It's not like the best.

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,590
Scott: It's not like SNES Zelda or anything like that, but you know, it's a good game, you know.

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:05,010
Scott: And it's like it's sort of weird cuz it's unlike other Zelda games Which like minish cap was sort of all bad, you know and Zelda 64 was sort of all good.

18
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:08,645
Scott: This is sort of like some parts are really good like that Goron dungeon.

19
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,965
Scott: That was the fucking dungeon Goddamn, but the main like the the ocean Kings dungeon.

20
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:17,518
Rym: so bad From what you and Alex were saying.

21
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,454
Rym: the co-op or not the co-op but like the multiplayer DS action It hasn't got.

22
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:27,664
Scott: it has a multiplayer mode and like many DS games They sort of tack on a multiplayer mode like say New Super Mario Brothers.

23
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:29,170
Scott: They tack on some multiplayer.

24
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:37,074
Rym: Ah, I still can't express to you enough how disappointed I was in that because it they could have done something amazing with that Multiplayer.

25
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:39,230
Rym: instead they made something insipid, right?

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:47,854
Scott: Well, the multiplayer they have tacked on to Zelda Phantom Hourglass is actually sort of related to a part of the game and is actually Quite good.

27
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,550
Scott: It's it's fun and strategic and it's like it's a good two people game.

28
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,482
Scott: So Phantom Hourglass will probably talk about it more if when Rym plays it.

29
00:01:56,663 --> 00:02:07,317
Scott: but some parts of it are great some parts of it annoying It's if you have a DS and you're looking for a game that'll take you know 10 to 20 hours of fun.

30
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,402
Rym: get advanced wars to.

31
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:11,679
Scott: if you are advanced wars You don't have it already.

32
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,010
Scott: But you know, this is this is on the list somewhere.

33
00:02:15,473 --> 00:02:23,014
Rym: Yeah, though speaking of new games I you know Scott works in the city and Emily works in the city and I well didn't have to go anywhere Yesterday.

34
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:25,946
Scott: cuz you're not starting work until what next Monday Guy Fawkes day.

35
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:30,430
Rym: Yep, but So Scott says that well, you should go get guitar hero 3.

36
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,110
Scott: Well, I was gonna go get it on my way home, but I remember that Rym wasn't going to work.

37
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:34,552
Scott: He was.

38
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:35,818
Scott: he's unemployed for a week.

39
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:37,887
Scott: So I said, why should I fucking get it?

40
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:42,562
Rym: You go get it Yeah, and curiously enough it would sold out a GameStop.

41
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:45,410
Scott: I figured that already it would be sold out just about everywhere.

42
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,190
Scott: That's why I wanted you to run around town looking for it, but I didn't have to run around.

43
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,430
Rym: I went to the target next door and they had plenty.

44
00:02:51,510 --> 00:03:01,290
Rym: However, they were sold out of the ps2 version apparently and at the GameStop I asked the guy and sure enough the PlayStation 2 version of guitar hero 3 sold out immediately.

45
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:10,110
Scott: Well, that makes the most sense considering, you know PlayStation 2 is the only system that has all the guitar heroes and most people who have guitar hero have it on those systems.

46
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,968
Scott: Right, and if you're gonna buy guitar hero 3, why would you get it for?

47
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:15,510
Scott: you know?

48
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,507
Rym: The 360 a system where you're only gonna have one guitar.

49
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:23,432
Scott: Yeah Well, no the 360. you can have more guitars because guitar hero 2 is on the 360.

50
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:31,585
Scott: Yeah, but even if you only have ps2 guitars Which most people do right if you have ps2 guitars already the game isn't any different on the ps2.

51
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:33,230
Scott: not not significantly different.

52
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:36,444
Scott: So you would get the ps2 version because you already have guitars like.

53
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:37,710
Scott: we got the Wii version, right?

54
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,167
Scott: Which I think was a good choice, even though it goes against my prior plan.

55
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:43,244
Scott: I think It was a good idea.

56
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:43,869
Rym: It's worth it.

57
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:47,738
Rym: I got to say though The funny thing is the Xbox 360 version didn't sell at all.

58
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:52,190
Rym: the GameStop had it and the target had a pile of them.

59
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:55,783
Rym: But what did sell out was the Wii one and there were three left.

60
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,490
Rym: the first one was dented to all hell.

61
00:03:58,052 --> 00:03:59,618
Rym: So I reached behind and grabbed the second one.

62
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:03,733
Rym: and while I'm looking at it, you know doing my mental check of yes It's the Wii version.

63
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:04,034
Rym: Yes.

64
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:04,756
Rym: It's the right one.

65
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:05,237
Rym: Let's go.

66
00:04:05,257 --> 00:04:09,650
Rym: I hear a guy right around the corner and he's talking to a target employee.

67
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:13,001
Rym: He says yeah, I was in the Wii section I can't find guitar hero through.

68
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:14,892
Rym: and then he comes around the corner goes Oh, never mind.

69
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:18,601
Rym: Yeah, and then he looks goes back past the dented all hell.

70
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:19,966
Scott: one grabs the other.

71
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,954
Scott: we know someone bought that dead All hell one.

72
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:24,629
Rym: Oh, yeah, cuz there are only three lovely within like 20 minutes.

73
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:27,717
Scott: But yeah, we got it.

74
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:37,295
Scott: it is I must say of all the guitar hero guitars I have used and I've used the original the guitar hero to ps2 and I've never used the 360 ones But this is the best one yet.

75
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:37,696
Scott: So

76
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:51,310
Rym: one that because I'm gonna bust right in this is my news - this game came out All right The guitar won the net comes off which is just great for carrying the stupid thing around And the faceplate comes off and we're gonna be able to buy all skin cool faceplates.

77
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,163
Rym: I'm waiting for some sort of Mario with an axe.

78
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:55,830
Scott: I'm waiting for something really cool.

79
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,845
Rym: Perhaps maybe perhaps link with an axe or shadow with an axe.

80
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:02,032
Scott: something cool will come out I guarantee you.

81
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:05,042
Rym: now it came with all these stickers, but with one exception.

82
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:08,349
Scott: the stickers are all I think the old guitar heroes Also came with stickers.

83
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:08,915
Rym: I don't know.

84
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:21,104
Rym: the stickers are all stupid and actually Because the guitar is white and the wiimote is white and the wiimote sticks in the back But kind of pokes out through the front I think it looks pretty snazzy in this kind of black and white minimalist way and

85
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:21,806
Scott: I don't

86
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:22,830
Rym: plan to modify

87
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:22,890
Scott: it.

88
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,906
Scott: I also think it looks pretty snazzy and I will not be buying a faceplate.

89
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:26,630
Scott: That is gaudy.

90
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,530
Rym: I will tell you that now also genius on the upper like right on the top of the guitar.

91
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,900
Rym: They put a little analog stick meaning one.

92
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:41,107
Rym: you can play Mario 1 with the guitar Which I did and it's actually not that hard to do.

93
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:52,482
Scott: Anyway, it was like green is a and red is B reason the analog stick is there so I don't need navigate the Wii menu and Actually turn the game on without having to use another score.

94
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:54,630
Rym: Of course Scott gets home and he picks it up.

95
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,839
Rym: He's like, ah, can I use it just?

96
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:59,149
Rym: and he starts trying to point the guitar at the TV.

97
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:00,315
Rym: He's like, it's not working.

98
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:01,059
Rym: This is bullshit.

99
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:02,185
Rym: And I'm like Scott.

100
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:03,230
Rym: There's an analog stick Scott.

101
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,983
Scott: There's an analog sticks and then I was listening to you like two minutes later.

102
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:08,529
Rym: He's like, oh wow, there's Rym.

103
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:08,850
Rym: check it out.

104
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:12,407
Scott: Yeah, pretty much Tom and not listening to you.

105
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:19,513
Rym: But I saw complaints on the internet about guitar hero 3 one of which was that the game Lags.

106
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:24,530
Rym: and all I have to say is no if the game is lagging then some of your audio-visual equipment is broken.

107
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:28,262
Rym: Yep, or you set it up poorly or something because the game does not like at all.

108
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:30,470
Rym: Nope, and the guitar is heavy.

109
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,293
Rym: It's solid.

110
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:36,710
Rym: the noises when you screw up come out of the Wiimote and not out of the TV and that is so hot.

111
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,301
Rym: That is so hot, especially when we're gonna play some co-op.

112
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,570
Rym: Yep, and I'll hear it coming out of Scott's guitar.

113
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:43,542
Scott: Oh, I hear it coming out of rims guitar more.

114
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:43,743
Scott: so.

115
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:52,130
Rym: well I think my favorite thing is that when you activate the star power Not only does the music get echoey and loud and don't you hear the crowd yelling and screaming?

116
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,951
Rym: But you get some vibration going on in the in the guitar vibration coming out of the guitar and it makes it Just.

117
00:06:57,971 --> 00:07:02,130
Scott: it feels like guitar also vibrates a little bit when star power is, you know acquired.

118
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:04,553
Scott: It's like you have star power Just so you know.

119
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:08,530
Rym: plus because you're using the Wiimote which has I guess better accelerometers.

120
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:14,630
Rym: It does that I never Activated the star power by accident something that happened all the time in the original guitar.

121
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:19,049
Scott: So always activated the star power successfully on purpose Yep.

122
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,428
Rym: And also like I can hold the guitar kind of up and it doesn't go like oh if you've tilted it activates.

123
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:27,830
Rym: if you just give It a good knock up or a knock down it activates.

124
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:31,624
Scott: Yeah, you just got to you know, shake the accelerometers a bit to activate it.

125
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:33,895
Rym: The song selection is of course Fantastic.

126
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:35,102
Rym: I don't think I need to get into that.

127
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:47,196
Scott: I am though I think that I've yet to play all the songs or unlock them all but it does feel like so far You know being I guess most of the way through the game that there's a lot me It's called legends of rock so I can.

128
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:51,370
Scott: I can see why it's got all these awesome songs painted black.

129
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:56,855
Scott: Yeah, that you know are already know like classic awesome rocks Hot shit.

130
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:58,627
Scott: I gotta say these songs rock.

131
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:03,610
Scott: However The thing I liked about guitar hero 1 & 2 is like this especially in guitar.

132
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:16,821
Scott: There are lots of songs that I had never heard before and did not know and restored, you know sort of more independent I guess not completely independent but more independent and less record company.

133
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:17,563
Scott: that I didn't know.

134
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:22,800
Scott: but we're awesome and it feels like this game is Lacking a large quantity of those types of songs.

135
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:32,645
Rym: So the only real thing this game is lacking I mean I could go in more about the Wii version or whatever, but it's fine Is that there's no Queen and there's no Led Zeppelin.

136
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:33,789
Scott: That's just not gonna happen.

137
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:44,359
Rym: now I know Scott I I think agree and I think you will too that if I were Led Zeppelin I would make a deal with them and release Stairway by itself for like 20 bucks.

138
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:46,105
Rym: because you know people would buy that.

139
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:46,827
Scott: I would buy it.

140
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:47,589
Rym: I might do.

141
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:53,874
Rym: But think about just a guitar hero stairway edition Ten bucks.

142
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,384
Scott: I would buy only ten maybe 15 maybe.

143
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,703
Rym: because imagine playing stairway here.

144
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:01,678
Scott: I just Yeah, also we can't on the Wii.

145
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:03,305
Scott: you can't buy spare guitars yet.

146
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:05,274
Scott: Yeah, that changes I'll go buy one.

147
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,208
Rym: The thing is you can play over the internet with the WFC.

148
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,902
Scott: Uh-huh, so cuz I want to do the co-op campaign with you.

149
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:14,030
Scott: So I can't do that without another guitar.

150
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,285
Rym: Well, I imagine we'll get a guitar pretty quick and - we're going to a party.

151
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:19,890
Scott: I think next weekend They're not gonna have we guitars there.

152
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:22,701
Rym: But if he buys guitar hero 3 for the Wii he's not.

153
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,950
Scott: he's gonna buy for the ps2 because he's already got one to do.

154
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:26,276
Rym: He's a dumbass.

155
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:27,220
Rym: he's got all the ones for the ps2.

156
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:31,575
Scott: He should accommodate us.

157
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:33,440
Scott: Oh, oh for the Wii.

158
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:36,570
Scott: Yes buy the Wii version then give us the guitar that you don't need.

159
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:38,798
Rym: Now two other things I got to say.

160
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:45,270
Rym: the there's this dual mode Where like in the single-player like you'll finish a set maybe an encore something.

161
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:51,720
Rym: Sometimes someone will come and challenge you to a duel and at first I thought God This is gonna be the stupidest thing ever.

162
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,403
Scott: It's not stupid.

163
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:53,790
Rym: It's awesome actually doing it.

164
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,553
Rym: It's pretty fun.

165
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:58,266
Scott: and the songs and it's like, you know the first, you know, who is it?

166
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:02,023
Scott: It's um Tamarello, I think yeah, and it's like.

167
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:09,350
Scott: and then in the second one Yeah, they had they had him, you know play this song, you know for the challenge and it's wicked cool.

168
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:11,769
Scott: You know, it's and it's not something you can hear anywhere else.

169
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:18,350
Rym: And the thing is I am at I mean DDR had a battle mode and it kind of like reviewing the whole game for the show.

170
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:22,363
Rym: Hey, that's fine Because we have nothing but positive things to say about our top.

171
00:10:22,403 --> 00:10:23,970
Scott: no, there's some negative things.

172
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,070
Rym: There's news on the internet that supposedly I meant about our main topic not about Guitar Hero 3.

173
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,590
Scott: Oh that the Dolby Pro Logic 2 if you're using that and the Wii version does some audio problems.

174
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,737
Scott: That's what I read on the internet.

175
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:40,145
Rym: Well, I'm not gonna get into it But if you know how Dolby Pro Logic works, well, you get what you deserve.

176
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:46,782
Rym: Yep, and You can't get a spare guitar yet Yeah But from what I might the rumor mill is that they want.

177
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:51,570
Rym: they push this game out and they didn't want to risk Not having enough guitars or whatever.

178
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:59,570
Rym: Yep and cuz they knew anyone who bought the game was probably buy an extra guitar and I don't think they could have made as Not enough guitars to release the game and have it.

179
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:03,430
Scott: It's like what would have happened was you would have gone to GameStop and they would had a pile of game.

180
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:09,857
Scott: You know discs there and no guitars and you know, they would have sold, you know Only half as many games right away.

181
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,278
Rym: Plus as I saw the game is selling out and a lot of places I don't pretty much everywhere.

182
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,322
Scott: Yeah, but the only What.

183
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:19,595
Rym: What are you gonna say?

184
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:20,478
Rym: I was gonna talk about how.

185
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:32,987
Rym: the opening video they they have personified the god of rock in this game and you see him and all I want to say about that is that he looks exactly the way the god of rock should is a cross between Satan and Thor.

186
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,522
Scott: There's one more thing what do you have to say, but I forgot it.

187
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:38,265
Rym: Oh good game.

188
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:50,174
Rym: So yeah Well, I can't - a lot of our friends made fun of us because we were not so good at Guitar Hero Because we never played it and we always said if we actually own the game we get good real quick and they're like I'm reminding them.

189
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:52,442
Rym: Well because we're getting good real quick.

190
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,566
Scott: Don't remind people of our shit.

191
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:53,867
Scott: Talk.

192
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:55,575
Rym: Our shit Talk is coming true.

193
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,023
Scott: We're number one rule of shit talking.

194
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:57,907
Scott: Don't really shit.

195
00:11:57,948 --> 00:11:58,189
Scott: Talk.

196
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:00,870
Rym: I'm not really shit talking.

197
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:06,627
Rym: I am preemptively bringing up the fact that I'm going to own some people at some battles in the near future.

198
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:08,655
Rym: Yeah All right.

199
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:09,889
Rym: So what do you have in the news?

200
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:13,203
Rym: Okay, so better than Guitar Hero 3 for the Wii.

201
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,106
Scott: not my news.

202
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,070
Scott: yours was not a news.

203
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,395
Scott: It was a geek bite says cheating.

204
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:17,117
Rym: It's also a news.

205
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:18,120
Rym: It's both.

206
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:20,870
Scott: I did - mine's actual news in the board gaming land.

207
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:23,038
Scott: You know Mayfair games I do.

208
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,544
Scott: they have a new policy.

209
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:25,588
Rym: Oh, really?

210
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:34,690
Scott: Yes the new policy is that If they're gonna sell a game, you know, then you're a game retailer.

211
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,650
Scott: Let's say you're a gaming store, right and you buy some settlers copies, right?

212
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:46,929
Scott: You're not allowed Now according to Mayfair games to sell those settlers copies for more than 20% off what you paid for them.

213
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:48,333
Rym: Uh-huh.

214
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:50,901
Scott: No 20% off manufacturers suggested retail price.

215
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:54,977
Scott: All right, huh, and this is legal, you know I mean Apple does this.

216
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:56,911
Scott: no one's allowed to discount iPods, you know This.

217
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,670
Scott: this used to be illegal and I think it's legal now.

218
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,558
Rym: I don't think it should be legal but that's not the point.

219
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:02,402
Scott: that's besides the point.

220
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:03,225
Scott: but this is legal.

221
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,650
Scott: now people have you know Talking about how it is legal.

222
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:12,489
Rym: Well, because it's kind of a cut like I mean, I guess the way it would really work It's just that a company's within its rights to just say well, I'm not selling to you.

223
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:13,649
Scott: That's pretty much what they're gonna do.

224
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,730
Scott: If you let's say you order you buy a bunch of copies of settlers and you sell them for five bucks each.

225
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,664
Scott: You know where you sell them at cost.

226
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:24,850
Scott: then Mayfair games is gonna not let you buy any more copies of settlers.

227
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,990
Rym: But the thing is you can't discount them too much or you're not gonna make any money.

228
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:34,168
Scott: So but I think the problem here is what they're specific their specific goal in mind, right?

229
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:34,469
Scott: Is that?

230
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:40,923
Scott: Online retailers with no overhead Can put a much bigger discount on the games.

231
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:43,030
Scott: Oh, yeah say the local gaming store.

232
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:53,049
Rym: however, this sets a bad precedent in the long run because uh There have been other games in the past particularly games workshop games where similar policies were in place.

233
00:13:53,973 --> 00:14:04,510
Scott: Yeah games workshop is nefarious for putting all sorts of restrictions Like websites are not allowed to use the games workshop logo on their site and they're not allowed to use certain words on their site.

234
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:07,670
Scott: And you know, they're not allowed to cut the prices more than a certain amount.

235
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,846
Scott: You know a games workshop has games workshop stores one of them's in New York City.

236
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:12,508
Scott: I know where it is.

237
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:12,869
Rym: Yeah

238
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,924
Scott: Or you can order from their mail-order catalog and

239
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:29,710
Rym: yeah, even though honestly I'll tell you this if you ever want anything games workshop the best way to do it play on find I know on eBay cuz there's always someone who realized that those games are bullshit and is selling their whole collection for not so much.

240
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:38,930
Scott: Another good idea is to instead of playing Warhammer find some other miniatures game that is not made by games workshop Where the prices are not fixed on the miniatures and play that instead.

241
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,693
Scott: It's just as good.

242
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:51,981
Rym: if you just want to play Warhammer and you don't want to buy and deal with all the crap Find a friend who's really into Warhammer and just say hey, I kind of want to play Warhammer They'll give you an entire army just cuz they're desperate for someone to play with.

243
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:54,410
Rym: could be you'll lose but you'll get better.

244
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:54,982
Scott: It could be.

245
00:14:55,832 --> 00:15:03,268
Scott: Anyway, the point is is that there's some price fixing going on in the board game world And I think I'm pretty sure they're trying to you know crack down on.

246
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:11,223
Scott: you know the internet retailers which kind of pisses me off because I like buying from the internet more than I like buying at the store because the Store is like 15 20 minutes away.

247
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,790
Scott: Here's the thing cuz I'm sure doesn't have the wide selection of the internet or the low price.

248
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,285
Scott: Well, except millennium games except millennium games.

249
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:19,050
Rym: I will our way.

250
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:27,670
Rym: I mean think when I will try hours away I'll drive to millennium games five hours away in Rochester, New York to buy board games oftentimes before I'll order them online.

251
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,998
Scott: Yeah, but only that's one store.

252
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:32,750
Rym: Yeah, no one not everyone has a millennium games.

253
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:41,270
Rym: I think the real problem I mean I want to end people might argue that Well, maybe this will give a shot in the arm to the local game store in the gaming community and make gaming as a whole more.

254
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:45,430
Scott: No, that's gonna make game buyers pissed off at Mayfair and I want to buy Mayfair games.

255
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:47,050
Scott: They're just to get in games mad cheap.

256
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,718
Rym: Well, my argument against that is is beyond.

257
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:58,029
Rym: what Scott said is simply that game stores that foster community Don't need a shot in the arm like that because they can do just fine on their own.

258
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:12,532
Rym: Game stores that fail tend to not realize that their biggest asset are the people who come to their store Yeah, and that by tricking them into coming to their store all the time They'll end up making a lot of money just from the fact that those people get other people into games who then go to the Yeah,

259
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:30,460
Scott: but if you're Mayfair games right and let's and your customers are these stores you know and let's say 10 of the stores are awesome and foster a sense of community and are able to sell their games and 50 of the stores are not then you're not gonna make a lot of money because those 50 stores are Shitty at selling your products and there's not much you can do about.

260
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,062
Rym: but you know what?

261
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:33,190
Scott: in that case the stores not suck.

262
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:36,699
Rym: Unlike games workshop Mayfair doesn't own these stores.

263
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:46,310
Rym: if I were a Mayfair I'd say fuck you all and just Whoever online and if they sell things discounted I got the same amount of money either way.

264
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:47,067
Rym: So I don't care.

265
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:59,621
Scott: The problem is is they sell more if they can get all these stores to buy their stuff and keep it on the shelves Whereas online you're only get says the thing with with online You know selling is that the number of things you sell on.

266
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:00,684
Scott: say amazon.com.

267
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:04,141
Scott: right every book Amazon sells is a book Someone reads right.

268
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:09,643
Scott: but meanwhile Every book that borders buys from the publisher.

269
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:11,430
Scott: those might not all get read.

270
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:18,169
Scott: So the publisher likes it when borders buys their books because borders buys a bunch of books Even if people don't actually buy them in the end.

271
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:18,972
Rym: Well, yeah I like that.

272
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:25,499
Rym: but are the borders near us where they have like one of every crappy manga just to have a shelf full of Manga, no one buys that manga because no one goes to?

273
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,101
Scott: that is great.

274
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:28,050
Scott: The cows just graze on it the manga cast.

275
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:36,637
Scott: Yeah The way to make money as a publisher of things is to sell a lot of your product to retailers who will keep it on Shelves, which means you get money.

276
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:49,430
Rym: whether any you know customers actually buy that probably depends I mean because one of the things that could be returnable well one of what destroyed Dungeons & Dragons back in the second ed days was at a point where there were a million books and they really weren't selling.

277
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:56,882
Rym: and Then all at once all the Walden books just said, you know what we're sending all of this crap back And TSR almost went bankrupt.

278
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,270
Scott: Yeah, it goes a good times.

279
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:06,050
Rym: If only they had gone bankrupt instead of being bought out with arts up that coast fall got to container items has bro.

280
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,435
Rym: Hey, at least they did something smart.

281
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:11,790
Rym: They got rid of whatever crap they had before and now forgotten realms is the actual campaign setting.

282
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:17,386
Scott: Yeah, it's funny though how Wizards of the coast now sort of has like this monopoly over more and more of gaming.

283
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:20,436
Scott: Yeah It's really just has bro.

284
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:24,650
Rym: And luckily it hasn't affected me because I buy so few games.

285
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,878
Scott: I got burning wheel books.

286
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:31,394
Scott: You can take them from my cold dead hand And so D&D fuck you I don't care.

287
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:38,589
Scott: and I've got my Tigris and Euphrates Which I bought for Mayfair Games before the price fixing days and you can take that from my cold dead hands, too.

288
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,170
Rym: You know, we'll stop this very quickly and get to the main bit.

289
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:47,480
Rym: but I just would like to say one thing too because I know a lot of you always are just kind of salivating for news of our burning wheel exploits.

290
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:58,640
Rym: now that we're making the change and I would just like to say that Let this previous weekend when the Visigoths came and for once didn't destroy our house Because they came for less people per unit time.

291
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,414
Rym: I'm not gonna yeah, yeah, but regardless of all that there they were good But we're good.

292
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:09,766
Rym: We played full-on burning wheel like straight and everyone knew the rules for the most part and we just hit the ground running.

293
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:19,490
Rym: and all I have to say is That was the most fun I've had role-playing outside of being in the physical presence of Luke Crane since high school.

294
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,739
Rym: That was so hot.

295
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,992
Rym: it play burning wheel by the go to Luke Burning.

296
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:27,097
Scott: we think about when he played.

297
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:35,110
Scott: all I got to say is this the only I'll give you this anecdotal evidence When we play D&D, I'd be like getting up and getting food and going to the bathroom and kind of sleep.

298
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:43,090
Scott: I there was the point at which I wasn't even doing much and I didn't want to get up to pee cuz I didn't want to miss Happen was awesome.

299
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:45,778
Rym: I did a thing and I do this great awesome thing.

300
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,021
Rym: great success all around.

301
00:19:47,382 --> 00:19:56,330
Rym: and then Pete tries to do something and it fails Miserably and causes horrible problems for us, but you know what both were equally awesome.

302
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:58,219
Scott: Yeah, it was good times.

303
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:02,603
Rym: So seriously We you know, we talked about our switching to burning wheel.

304
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:04,292
Rym: and yeah, D&D is not so great You know what?

305
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:07,890
Rym: I think I am done with Dungeons & Dragons forever.

306
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,310
Rym: I can't imagine anything that would make me switch from burning wheel.

307
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:13,089
Scott: No, I really couldn't.

308
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,459
Rym: It's it's such a hot system.

309
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,248
Rym: I all of you should buy it.

310
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:22,463
Scott: I mean, even if you don't play it, it's 25 bucks for two books.

311
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:22,904
Scott: That's it.

312
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:28,019
Rym: And you know what if nothing else It's really fun to make characters in burning wheel.

313
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,663
Scott: It's so fun.

314
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:31,769
Scott: I'm like, I've been wanting to remake mine.

315
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:32,813
Scott: so bad I might do it right.

316
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,107
Rym: Alex Scott and I sat down one day and made characters and didn't even doing.

317
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:40,110
Scott: I might say it's more Fun the entire hero because that's what I might be doing right after this show.

318
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:41,294
Rym: You know, it kind of is.

319
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,238
Rym: but I'm actually.

320
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,265
Rym: when D&D ended I wasn't thinking.

321
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:45,490
Rym: Oh man time to get some food.

322
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,698
Rym: I was thinking oh man.

323
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:48,409
Rym: I want to play more burning wheel.

324
00:20:49,696 --> 00:21:00,321
Scott: Fight for what I believe in things of the day Statress.

325
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:06,579
Rym: it's just countries stasis statress like state wrists or state tris.

326
00:21:07,524 --> 00:21:18,169
Rym: It's countries states countries falling down From the north to the south and you got to rotate them left and right and land them where they go And it's actually really really fun.

327
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:18,510
Scott: Huh?

328
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:28,809
Rym: That should teach you a lot about Geographies, yeah, I was surprised how on one hand I knew a lot more than I thought I did about certain areas But on the other hand, I didn't know anything about some area.

329
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:30,455
Scott: Yeah, I saw you playing.

330
00:21:30,495 --> 00:21:31,620
Scott: it was a map of Europe, right?

331
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,380
Scott: Yeah, I totally like the Balkans like I knows the names of a bunch of countries over there like, you know, Serbia.

332
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:41,726
Rym: See, I know that whole area like Hers a Covina.

333
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:42,829
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

334
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:43,169
Scott: Yeah.

335
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,317
Scott: Oh is it anyway, so you see that's how that place would be.

336
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,177
Scott: just big gap I would fuck it all up.

337
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:55,727
Rym: See I remember it cuz like one's eating the other one like an amoeba and I know that whole area But other places not so much.

338
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,132
Rym: I forgot where Andorra wins.

339
00:21:57,493 --> 00:21:58,877
Scott: I have no clue where Andorra goes.

340
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:02,104
Scott: I know where Cyprus goes But it's kind of fun.

341
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,928
Rym: It's worth five minutes of your time.

342
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:08,240
Scott: All right, so here's a cool flash game called electro city.

343
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,009
Scott: It's supposed to be an educational flash game, but whatever.

344
00:22:11,451 --> 00:22:15,840
Scott: basically it's sort of like Sim City in a way And you've got this little tiny grid.

345
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:25,180
Scott: It's like five by five and there's a little coast and maybe some mountains and some woods and in the middle Square is your city and that's the only square that's gonna have your city on it.

346
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,624
Scott: So basically you're trying to do.

347
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:31,400
Scott: you can do stuff on every other square to try to make your city bigger, right?

348
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,473
Scott: I mean you have money right and you can adjust.

349
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:35,900
Scott: there's basically four things.

350
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,068
Scott: You're trying to balance here your money.

351
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:42,919
Scott: you get more money if you raise up, you know the taxes But then people get unhappy.

352
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:45,735
Scott: So the happiness is the second thing you're trying to balance.

353
00:22:45,775 --> 00:22:46,720
Scott: you want to keep the people happy.

354
00:22:47,223 --> 00:22:48,311
Scott: You want to get lots of money.

355
00:22:48,774 --> 00:22:49,660
Scott: when you get a lot of money?

356
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,723
Scott: You can build things.

357
00:22:50,824 --> 00:22:51,326
Scott: mostly.

358
00:22:51,406 --> 00:23:03,883
Scott: electricity is what this game is teaching you about, you know, so you you start out with like one wind farm and You know, you can build up all sorts of different electricals, you know supplies, you know coal gas oil Whatever.

359
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:05,108
Rym: I was wrong.

360
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:06,293
Rym: Sarajevo is the city.

361
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:11,175
Rym: Herzegovina is not a city But it's a tiny tiny tiny little part of Bosnia.

362
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:16,972
Scott: Anyway, anyway The fourth thing you're trying to manage in this game is the environment.

363
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:23,420
Scott: So it's like money happiness power Environment and it's a turn-based game.

364
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:33,924
Scott: so you have a hundred and fifty turns and you can only do so much per turn and You're trying to get the city in the middle to be as big and bad as you can but also have the happiness.

365
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:41,129
Scott: be as happy as you can as much money as you can as good an environment as you can in a 150 turns and it's it's pretty fun.

366
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:43,078
Scott: And I've gotten like.

367
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:53,297
Scott: the best score I got was a plus a plus C a plus because my population was low But I managed to get lots of electricity a great environment lots of money and lots of happiness.

368
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:54,200
Scott: Just not enough people.

369
00:23:54,463 --> 00:24:04,834
Scott: so I Felt like if I would have pushed it any harder to get more people, you know Building another gas plant or something that would have ruined the other things, you know I've always kind of like games like that where they give you a like.

370
00:24:04,894 --> 00:24:11,870
Rym: it's kind of like a Figure out the optimal way and it's kind of a once you've beat the game you're done with it forever but getting there is really fun.

371
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:20,060
Scott: It's also very slick and Very well designed and it's a. it's a fun experience and it's flash and it's free and it's semi educational.

372
00:24:20,202 --> 00:24:21,520
Scott: I think it's supposed to be educational.

373
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:23,103
Scott: Yeah, okay.

374
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:23,625
Scott: So play it.

375
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:24,327
Scott: It's fun.

376
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:27,376
Rym: So speaking of games you should play.

377
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:46,088
Rym: I figure we should at least devote one episode to this because I really think it was probably the Greatest triumph in game development and design Since tribes - it is probably better than tribes - all things considered design Yeah, I mean tribes - was a great game.

378
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:50,829
Rym: probably a better game in terms of you know, a different multiplayer single-player realms.

379
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,899
Scott: I think in terms of like.

380
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:04,520
Scott: You know like game design as you know You get out you get a book about video game design and this this game is like the game that follows every rule in the book tribes - is just a game that didn't follow most of the rules in the book.

381
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,260
Scott: It just happened to be a game that was right up our alleys.

382
00:25:07,662 --> 00:25:10,300
Scott: I wouldn't consider like, you know some like greatest game ever.

383
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,175
Scott: it's like our greatest game ever for the kind of game we want.

384
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:16,303
Scott: but portal is Might be.

385
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:20,159
Rym: maybe I'd go one step further and say that portal wrote a new book.

386
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:23,960
Scott: It may be it just write a new book this game chapter in the book.

387
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,080
Rym: perhaps this game was just so slick like I and I. even the zero punctuation guy was like.

388
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,947
Rym: I have nothing bad to say about this game.

389
00:25:31,987 --> 00:25:32,408
Rym: You know what?

390
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,540
Rym: I agree with him entirely that zero punctuation guy.

391
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:42,853
Scott: I watched every one of his videos because now that I discovered him I have Agree with everything he has said in all of his videos.

392
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:47,767
Scott: 100% agree so as until a future further notice.

393
00:25:47,827 --> 00:26:01,779
Scott: if you wonder what Scott or Rym thinks about a video game and the Zero-punctuation guy has talked about that video game assume we agree 100% And don't wait for us to review it because it's like dazing taking the crazy out of Richard Carrey.

394
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:11,315
Rym: Okay, I don't think I need to but I guess very briefly.

395
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:14,706
Rym: portal is a game Released by valve.

396
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:23,195
Rym: you might remember valve from such games as half-life Half-life 2 counter-strike team fortress - -.

397
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:27,413
Scott: Yeah, so this is the third game in the orange box.

398
00:26:27,434 --> 00:26:28,439
Scott: in the orange box you get.

399
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:31,684
Scott: well No, I guess the fifth game in the orange box but yeah, you get.

400
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:32,245
Scott: you know.

401
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:41,171
Scott: half-life 2 episode 2. half-life 2 episode 1. half-life 2 team fortress 2 and portal and We already talked about team fortress 2 enough.

402
00:26:41,191 --> 00:26:42,419
Scott: We're not speaking about it again.

403
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:46,280
Scott: Half-life - we had to wait till Rym plays all those games even though I've played them to death.

404
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:51,008
Scott: I just haven't had time and I Should be bioshock first.

405
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:52,693
Rym: I killed one boss.

406
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:55,040
Rym: I got a key and then I just I've been doing other things.

407
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,843
Scott: Yeah, I know right.

408
00:26:56,184 --> 00:26:59,036
Scott: and now we got guitar heroes and we got DS action.

409
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,223
Scott: Yeah, but damn it Yeah but portal.

410
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:08,604
Scott: we both beat portal because the thing about portal is it only takes like a couple hours to beat and in fact my Second and third times through.

411
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:19,526
Scott: I didn't beat it entirely a second or third time, but I'm after beating it once I can just burn through the game like I can get up to the weighted companion cube in like 15 minutes Probably even less.

412
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,654
Scott: it's like whoosh.

413
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:21,519
Scott: I can just get through.

414
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:22,764
Rym: Yeah Which is great.

415
00:27:22,804 --> 00:27:32,010
Rym: because and I have to say if you've played the game and beaten it Play through with the commentary because we're not gonna talk about everything They say in the commentary simply because they say it better

416
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,183
Scott: than I don't see all the commentary because I didn't beat it in commentary Mode.

417
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:37,059
Rym: I got almost to the end so far.

418
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:41,939
Rym: once they started talking about how they made the portals work and how they dealt with the physics and

419
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:55,720
Scott: It's like, you know, it seemed like everyone who is who played the game, you know They was interested in it for a different reason Like I was interested in it for like the programming reasons Like how do they program those portals and other people were interested in like, how did they render those portals?

420
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,760
Scott: You know other people were like, how do they design this level to be all clever like, you know.

421
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:10,295
Scott: And it they the commentary has whatever the your interest is in the behind the scenes They cover it somewhere in that commentary and it's way cool way cool.

422
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:11,539
Rym: Very insightful, too.

423
00:28:12,282 --> 00:28:14,931
Scott: Yeah, like if remember our whining episode we were like.

424
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:16,416
Scott: you don't know anything about game design.

425
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:26,961
Scott: if you watch You know the commentaries for this or team fortress You will see What the kind of things that they are thinking in their game design and why you should stop whining and why they're smarter than you Are.

426
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:28,806
Scott: it was obvious.

427
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:36,689
Rym: the story of portal is that you're some woman and you wake up Somewhere and a computer tells you to do things

428
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:43,999
Scott: you wake up in like our picture labs some sort You don't know and it's part of something called our picture and they're doing a scientific experiment and you're

429
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,120
Rym: it.

430
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,264
Rym: You're like the test subject.

431
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:52,828
Rym: the computer directs you around to all these tasks and it's obvious that it's kind of like a lab and Your promised cake at the end of all the experiments.

432
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:54,614
Scott: Oh, you're promised all sorts of nice things.

433
00:28:54,754 --> 00:28:56,439
Rym: You're pretty much just promised cake.

434
00:28:57,242 --> 00:29:00,113
Rym: Also other things you will be baked and then cake will be served.

435
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:03,568
Scott: There will be a party for just for you Everyone will be there.

436
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:08,089
Rym: Well, except for all right You gotta make this not be to what movies.

437
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:09,655
Rym: you see what I always say a quote fast.

438
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:13,271
Rym: whenever they review a movie they like They just kind of like remember when blah happen.

439
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,100
Scott: Oh, yeah, remember when blah happened.

440
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,743
Rym: Don't do that.

441
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:18,054
Rym: Oh, yeah, and then actually review the movie.

442
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:19,280
Scott: Yeah, that could be.

443
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:22,340
Rym: If it's a bad game, we'll just go right into it.

444
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,560
Rym: Well, this sucked and this sucked but I could probably spend an hour just quoting the computer and be happy.

445
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:35,319
Scott: Yeah, so while you're doing this, you know, these these test experiments because you're the test subject Basically they're puzzles and you do them one at a time.

446
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:45,700
Rym: Yeah, because the real the core of the game is that there's this gun you can use to put portals two different kinds of portals But they're really like there's two different portals that are linked on any surface.

447
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:51,387
Scott: Yeah One blue and one orange at any one time and you go in the blue you come out the orange you go in the orange You come out the blue and they're connected.

448
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:52,613
Rym: you look through do whatever you want.

449
00:29:52,673 --> 00:29:54,381
Rym: So like say I'm in my room now You know what?

450
00:29:54,863 --> 00:29:58,737
Rym: I'll link to a penny arcade that shows you exactly what the portals are the slide.

451
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,280
Scott: Yeah That was so great.

452
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,909
Rym: If you shot a portal directly above you into your ceiling and directly below you into the floor You would fall forever through your room continuously.

453
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:11,100
Rym: You can shoot one in front of you and behind you and poke yourself in the back.

454
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:19,860
Scott: Yep You could put one Under your feet and then put one above your head and then drop a block into the one on the floor and it'll crush you.

455
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:23,499
Rym: That's a great use I know right?

456
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:25,789
Scott: Yeah, it's basically.

457
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:28,240
Scott: you know, this portal thing in itself is way cool.

458
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,960
Scott: But also they came up with all sorts of clever uses for the portal.

459
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:38,219
Scott: For example, you know You could put one on the wall way high up and then one on the floor right in front of you.

460
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:43,640
Scott: You go in the one on the floor and you pop out of the wall way high up and you start falling really fast.

461
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:49,800
Scott: Then you fall back into the one on the floor again And you already have all this acceleration because you were fault.

462
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,392
Scott: You were free falling for you know, however high up the portal was let's say it's 20 feet up in the air You're just free-falling for 20 feet.

463
00:30:56,412 --> 00:30:59,771
Scott: Oh You're coming out of a portal on the wall.

464
00:31:00,214 --> 00:31:01,240
Scott: You're going pretty fast.

465
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,940
Scott: You're gonna keep going pretty fast whoosh and you can use that to get to all sorts of high up places.

466
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,226
Scott: Yeah You have to or like.

467
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:18,040
Rym: there's a big button on the floor somewhere like up high And so I shoot a portal above the button and then I shoot a portal Underneath a block and the block just falls through then out the ceiling onto the button and then I continue

468
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:19,243
Scott: Yeah,

469
00:31:19,924 --> 00:31:23,212
Rym: and the puzzles are done especially if you play through the commentary.

470
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:38,480
Rym: the puzzles are so perfectly designed to teach you how to use this gun and yet at the same time provide interesting challenging environments and Then the thing happens and the game goes all crazy and then it's just awesome from that point forward like unceasing awesome.

471
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,480
Scott: Yeah in the commentary they do spend a lot of time talking about how they designed.

472
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:43,042
Scott: Like.

473
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:47,940
Scott: there's only what like, you know, so many missions 19 and then there's the endgame, right?

474
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:51,356
Rym: Which is like it's like half the game is more than half the game.

475
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,040
Scott: the missions.

476
00:31:52,482 --> 00:32:05,346
Scott: the goal of those missions is to sort of teach you how to deal with the portal gun and They talk about in the commentary a lot about how they structured the missions to teach you all the skills in an intuitive and Good learning curve way.

477
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:09,260
Rym: cuz think it's not like a team fortress game where you'll learn just by playing over and over again.

478
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:14,300
Rym: This is a game that you're expected to play through from start to finish not play over and over and over.

479
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:18,671
Rym: So they've got to teach you about this world they've created.

480
00:32:18,892 --> 00:32:27,760
Rym: they've got to teach you about all the kinds of puzzles They're going to give you and they've got to set you up so that you'll be equipped Mentally to be able to deal with the later parts of the area.

481
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,490
Scott: They teach you a skill then they reinforce that skill.

482
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,755
Scott: then they teach you another skill.

483
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:34,829
Scott: then they teach you how to use that skill In combination with one you learn before.

484
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:35,975
Scott: then they reinforce that.

485
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:40,675
Rym: and you know It's educators could do well to take a hand from portal.

486
00:32:40,956 --> 00:32:41,498
Scott: Oh they could.

487
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:53,627
Rym: indeed I foresee a future of education being done very differently And I I I don't think we should lock children in a lab with a slightly homicidal Computer and see who makes it out.

488
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:57,418
Rym: No, but at the same time that would make a very Spartan robust society.

489
00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:00,269
Rym: maybe But I and there would be cake.

490
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:06,695
Scott: the one thing I worry about with portal though is you know It's such a clean and sit like the design of it and the learning curve of it.

491
00:33:06,715 --> 00:33:07,940
Scott: when a gamer plays it they go.

492
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:09,809
Scott: Oh non gamers could play this.

493
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:18,680
Scott: it'd be amazing and I think it would but I Don't think that portal does a good job of teaching you basic FPS skills, and I haven't tried this yet.

494
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,320
Scott: But my theory is like my mom could not play portal because she would first need to learn.

495
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:31,760
Rym: You know WASD aim with the mouse shoot with the mat, you know It's kind of like how grandma can't use Firefox because she doesn't know how to move the mouse yet.

496
00:33:32,021 --> 00:33:33,827
Scott: Yeah, and portal does.

497
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:38,763
Scott: it has a great learning curve for anyone who already has basic FPS in skills But I don't.

498
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:48,980
Scott: I am not confident that if you do not already know how to at least do the basics of a 3d FPS You know walk around and shoot at things that you will be able to do portal right away.

499
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,838
Scott: You'll have perhaps some trouble and take some minutes to get used to it.

500
00:33:52,858 --> 00:34:00,296
Scott: Sadly I think the best way to learn those skills is just a beat quake - yeah beat quake - or beat half-life 1 on easy or Something like that.

501
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:07,954
Scott: You know the only thing I can think of in the world that actually teaches Basic FPS skills is the half-life 1 training mode.

502
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:09,480
Scott: Do you know anything else at all?

503
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,405
Rym: Uh, you know what did you know?

504
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,047
Rym: what did it for me?

505
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:24,100
Scott: Hmm a good 14 years of playing FPS Just to go from never having played a 3d FPS with the mouse and keyboard to Being able to walk around and shoot with confidence.

506
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,503
Scott: Yeah, just think I mean the basics.

507
00:34:25,824 --> 00:34:28,670
Rym: doom when doom came out and I got doom.

508
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:34,170
Rym: I Didn't know how to play FPS.

509
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:35,260
Scott: is you suck?

510
00:34:35,382 --> 00:34:36,034
Scott: But you were able to.

511
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:36,320
Scott: you know.

512
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:39,980
Scott: How long did it take you before you knew understood how to walk and shoot and aim at things?

513
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:40,980
Rym: Yeah, well that didn't take long.

514
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,179
Rym: But being able being confident and being good and not being afraid when I see any bad guy Well, no, we're not talking about bad guys.

515
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,699
Scott: I'm just talking about getting a handle on the controls so that you don't have to constantly think about.

516
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,960
Rym: you know Yeah, but at the same time I had previous video game and experience.

517
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,619
Rym: I mean my parents couldn't play portal and my parents couldn't play quake - yeah, they just wouldn't get it.

518
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:16,939
Scott: So well, really I wish valve would sort of redo the half-life 1 training mode somehow or make something similar Just sort of like take someone who's never played a mouse and keyboard PC FPS and get them up to speed to where you know They would have the skills where they could beat half-life 1 if they started it, you know

519
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,563
Rym: Of course.

520
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:18,935
Rym: at the same time there's a little bit of that.

521
00:35:18,955 --> 00:35:28,114
Rym: was that theory We were talking about the other day with Alex mechanism design theory where they set up Environments in such a way as to encourage a certain kind of gameplay which they desire.

522
00:35:28,134 --> 00:35:29,780
Scott: Yep, and it works.

523
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:33,410
Rym: And I thought well, I just I think we'll leave it at that.

524
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:37,946
Rym: I think those principles could be applied to many arenas Many many areas.

525
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:39,712
Rym: So what really makes portal great?

526
00:35:39,753 --> 00:35:42,585
Rym: I mean aside from the fact that it's polished It's perfect.

527
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:53,220
Rym: Like every puzzle is so meticulously designed The tolerances are exact the the the hints are just enough to make you figure it out and you will figure it out.

528
00:35:53,522 --> 00:35:56,279
Rym: But yet to feel like it was a huge accomplishment and it kind of was.

529
00:35:57,541 --> 00:36:00,520
Rym: But there's a lot more because if it was just that it would have been a pretty good game.

530
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:06,399
Rym: I think what made this game shine beyond anything else is Just the computer.

531
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:17,200
Scott: Yeah, I mean not only do you have this game with the probably the best learning curve ever Extremely polished, you know everything right that could be polished.

532
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,640
Scott: Amazing puzzles, you know, it's only a few hours long, but there's never a dull moment.

533
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:27,435
Scott: But they added this incredible like it's not this most complex.

534
00:36:27,536 --> 00:36:28,559
Scott: Oh my god blow your mind.

535
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:28,840
Scott: plot.

536
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:45,247
Scott: it's sort of a obvious transparent kind of plot, but the the way they pull it off is It's sort of you know, it's real for you at least while you play and it's incredibly humorous and quotable and Endearing I mean it.

537
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:48,080
Rym: and also it's so self-consistent.

538
00:36:48,722 --> 00:37:00,900
Rym: And I mean, we're really gonna avoid spoiling anything because there are some things that could be spoiled that are fantastic things involving cake Things that have probably been spoiled for you already on the rest of the internet and might be spoiled obliquely if you're intelligent.

539
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:09,260
Rym: But I'll say this Knowing or being able to guess what is going to happen will in no way detract from what actually happens.

540
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:20,584
Scott: No, no it because I knew a lot Knew about what it's sort of obvious like if you've ever watched any sort of like sci-fi anything in your life You start this game.

541
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:25,260
Scott: You immediately know everything there is to know about the basic of the plot.

542
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:25,621
Scott: There's.

543
00:37:25,962 --> 00:37:28,128
Scott: there's no mysteries for you.

544
00:37:28,168 --> 00:37:32,860
Rym: There's no surprises really, but the game just it does it so subtly and so well.

545
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,394
Rym: I mean it starts out in the very beginning and the computer is just very much like.

546
00:37:36,815 --> 00:37:38,060
Rym: this is a science experiment.

547
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:39,140
Rym: We're going to do blah.

548
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:46,730
Scott: Please step out of the blah and do the blah and do the blah and I immediately if you have any you know Any literary knowledge whatsoever you go.

549
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:48,357
Scott: something evil is going on.

550
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:49,040
Scott: I am in danger.

551
00:37:49,462 --> 00:37:54,377
Rym: well, not necessarily because it starts out really benign and like bit by bit.

552
00:37:54,921 --> 00:38:02,947
Rym: Little things are wrong about the computer or about the environment or little things are just off sort of like a game of paranoia Or a game of lacuna.

553
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:09,140
Rym: there was such a paranoia moment Because I remember way back in the day when Luke was running different Luke not Luke crane.

554
00:38:09,462 --> 00:38:27,018
Rym: I was running a paranoia game for us a paranoia larp and The computer spits out the sheet with the instructions of where we're supposed to go and to do that He holds his hands up and he like starts pushing the paper toward us and then he stops and I go to grab for it And then he starts pulling it back in and I and I only got half of it

555
00:38:27,761 --> 00:38:28,182
Scott: And I didn't

556
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:32,618
Rym: know what to do after that because it was like go to sector 7 something scribble

557
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:40,459
Scott: tear Yep, and it's like there's a point in the game where the computer is telling you what to do and it's like yes to beat This one you're going to need

558
00:38:41,562 --> 00:38:41,823
Rym: Yep.

559
00:38:41,883 --> 00:38:45,637
Rym: My favorite is be very careful under no circumstances.

560
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:46,059
Rym: Should you?

561
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,418
Rym: It would be very dangerous.

562
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,207
Scott: It's gonna become a quote fest.

563
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:54,236
Scott: Yeah, this puzzle is impossible.

564
00:38:54,277 --> 00:38:54,879
Scott: Just give up.

565
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:57,779
Rym: That was I. I just I love that.

566
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:17,760
Rym: I think what sums up the humor of the first half of the game is there's a moment where the computer says Due to the protocols of the experiment then you will not be monitored during the next experimental chamber and you walk into the chamber and there's a camera there Immediately looking at you and then there's another camera looking at you the whole time.

567
00:39:19,522 --> 00:39:24,720
Rym: But also I was talking about being self-consistent that you know, there's these computer things everywhere and they have cameras watching you.

568
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,385
Rym: But there's also every now.

569
00:39:26,425 --> 00:39:31,905
Rym: then you see kind of these glass windows way up high and you see like office chairs in there like.

570
00:39:32,029 --> 00:39:34,808
Rym: obviously Scientists are gonna be in there observing you but you

571
00:39:34,848 --> 00:39:38,660
Scott: don't ever actually see like shadows or anything up there moving around

572
00:39:39,205 --> 00:39:45,478
Rym: And then you like later in the game I always I was thinking like I got to get up there I got to see what's in there and sure enough I get in there.

573
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:54,380
Rym: later I start like I bust out of places and I I get to places I probably shouldn't be and I find somewhat disturbing things but also hilarious things.

574
00:39:54,681 --> 00:40:00,018
Scott: I think what the game really does is it provides you with this really sleek sort of.

575
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:02,747
Scott: you know Not even like it's.

576
00:40:02,888 --> 00:40:06,240
Scott: it's not even like a real gritty world like half-life 2 is you know?

577
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,762
Scott: It's so.

578
00:40:06,902 --> 00:40:12,488
Scott: it's sort of like being in an Atari game or like Tron or something like that, you know It's not a real world It's a video game world.

579
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:19,000
Scott: and then they'd let you Slowly but surely bust out of that world and go behind the scenes where there's a real gritty world.

580
00:40:19,282 --> 00:40:19,384
Rym: It's.

581
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:25,720
Rym: it's like a minor Chekhov's gun Like they show you those rooms and you see him and you think I'm gonna get back.

582
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:43,600
Scott: But at the same time it really brings back That whole feeling of like when you'd play a Nintendo game and you would get to like some secret room And you'd be like, oh man I'm in the secret room behind the scenes and I'm supposed to be here Sort of like in Zelda 1 if you go to the top right and you walk against the wall and you go to the place Where the guy gives you a hundred rupees or something like that, you know.

583
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,111
Scott: And it gave me that same feeling even though it was so obvious.

584
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:51,689
Scott: and so Chekhov's gun and so right, you know Protruding and you know what it still worked.

585
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:54,320
Rym: I got the feeling despite the game being pretty straightforward.

586
00:40:54,962 --> 00:41:02,306
Rym: It was kind of unnerving to be in those places like to be behind the scenes in this game and I Remember at one moment where I get into.

587
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:07,292
Rym: I'm in one of those rooms and I'm looking back out of the test chamber and I got A little chill for a second.

588
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:19,800
Rym: Yeah but I cannot stress enough how Absolutely fucking hilarious the game is after the thing happens about a little over halfway through like when the real game starts.

589
00:41:20,282 --> 00:41:22,113
Rym: Yep, I I can't.

590
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:23,400
Rym: I don't even want to quote anything.

591
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,800
Rym: I don't want to ruin it, but it's we ruined quite a bit, but it's really funny.

592
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:30,851
Rym: This is one of the funniest games I've played ever.

593
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:33,140
Scott: Yeah, it was quite the humor.

594
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,194
Rym: This is funnier than half the comedy movies I've seen in my life.

595
00:41:36,556 --> 00:41:39,736
Scott: Oh, yeah, definitely This means not Monty Python funny.

596
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:46,771
Rym: Don't get me wrong But you don't know what that thing does and neither do I so our best bet is just to leave it alone And I'll deal with it later.

597
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:47,879
Rym: Yeah alone.

598
00:41:50,165 --> 00:41:50,249
Rym: Yeah.

599
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:54,000
Scott: Do we want to say anything else about portal?

600
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,172
Scott: I guess if you you should probably buy the orange box.

601
00:41:57,232 --> 00:42:00,045
Scott: if you're any kind of human being buy it for you know if you really must.

602
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:09,934
Scott: if you have a 360 you but if you have to buy it for the 360 if you have a PC that can run it and you're a Windows user Get it for the PC because I think that's the better way to get.

603
00:42:09,954 --> 00:42:11,159
Rym: don't need much of a PC.

604
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,440
Scott: No, if you can play half-life 2 the original you can play this.

605
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:24,219
Scott: This isn't like, you know that new crisis game or anything that requires a monster PC, you know If you buy a Dell right now, not even the most expensive Dell you can play it's gonna work.

606
00:42:26,381 --> 00:42:38,819
Scott: If though you really think that you like are never gonna play like multiplayer FPS is or FPS is we have to shoot bad Guys, you know like you're really against that or you really don't think that's ever gonna be it for you.

607
00:42:39,362 --> 00:42:41,197
Scott: Then I think that is really the.

608
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,919
Scott: you know You're that kind of person and maybe you don't have a lot of time to play a lot of games like that.

609
00:42:46,282 --> 00:42:49,139
Scott: You know, there might be that person and I'm pretty sure there is.

610
00:42:49,783 --> 00:42:52,700
Scott: I do think there is a case to be made for buying portal on its own.

611
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:52,941
Scott: I think.

612
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:53,202
Scott: what's it?

613
00:42:53,202 --> 00:42:54,326
Scott: 20 bucks something like that?

614
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:55,611
Rym: I would have paid 40.

615
00:42:55,611 --> 00:42:58,001
Rym: Yeah, it's that good 50 60.

616
00:42:58,001 --> 00:43:07,687
Rym: Well, if you're gonna pay, you know that much money you can get the whole orange ball Yeah, but what I'm saying is that portal is worth a lot more than you're gonna have to pay for it Even if you buy it in the least optimal way.

617
00:43:07,908 --> 00:43:13,130
Scott: Yeah, so I guess if you are You know, you should buy it.

618
00:43:13,693 --> 00:43:22,585
Rym: in what order is without Question the best Pete the best gaming experience of the last year or two Now without like.

619
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,229
Rym: there's no argument against that.

620
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,456
Rym: it is such an amazing.

621
00:43:26,696 --> 00:43:28,983
Scott: It's it's $20.

622
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:31,720
Scott: You can even watch the trailer for free on steam power.

623
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,876
Rym: So even if you're not good at FPS is you can beat this game in under five hours.

624
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:43,640
Scott: Oh, yeah If you can solve like the I mean if you can solve puzzles then you can beat this game.

625
00:43:43,761 --> 00:43:55,840
Scott: It's it's a it's a puzzle something like if you can beat like Lola one Then you're more than good enough to beat portal plus like the game itself is, you know Two three four hours depending on how quickly you burn through it.

626
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:00,336
Rym: But they also have the commentary and they have this challenge mode.

627
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:03,106
Scott: Good God Challenge mode equals.

628
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:04,452
Scott: hard challenge mode equals.

629
00:44:04,512 --> 00:44:06,459
Scott: I'd only beat like a little over half of it.

630
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:07,703
Rym: Yeah, and there's two.

631
00:44:07,723 --> 00:44:07,924
Rym: there's.

632
00:44:08,024 --> 00:44:13,600
Rym: there's challenge things like beat this room with as few portals as possible, right?

633
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:18,345
Scott: It's it's it's the same rooms you've done already, but it's like okay You did this room before.

634
00:44:18,425 --> 00:44:22,520
Scott: right now do it with only like two portals and it's like oh my god.

635
00:44:23,222 --> 00:44:28,820
Scott: But some of the other ones are like, okay do this level again, but we slightly modified the level.

636
00:44:29,381 --> 00:44:32,110
Rym: Yeah, the advanced ones are just really hard things.

637
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,575
Scott: Yeah, I beat like four of those.

638
00:44:33,635 --> 00:44:36,759
Scott: I think maybe three but yeah They're really wicked hard.

639
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:55,232
Scott: so if you even if you beat the game and you know because the learning curve goes up and up and up and up and It's so exact but you know, it doesn't ever reach the max like it doesn't go to the maximum They could have made it keep going, you know They could have had 10 more levels 20 more levels Until they would have started getting things that were as hard as they could be.

640
00:44:55,252 --> 00:45:03,758
Scott: we had to use all your skills in combination But they don't and they just added like six challenge levels that do record, you know, bring the difficulty up higher.

641
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:10,834
Rym: now I got two more final things to say and I think we'll be done All right, one there's a song at the end of the game.

642
00:45:10,854 --> 00:45:12,420
Scott: Everyone knows about the song at the end of the game.

643
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:16,020
Rym: I just want to say do not listen to the song before you have played portal.

644
00:45:16,442 --> 00:45:21,480
Rym: Just just let it be this thing that you don't know about and just go into it blind.

645
00:45:21,821 --> 00:45:23,830
Rym: That is the best way to experience that.

646
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:30,000
Scott: so it was an article by the guy about I guess Interviewing the guy who wrote the song or made the song on dig today or something.

647
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:31,847
Scott: So check that out after you beat the game.

648
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:36,647
Rym: and two is it wrong of me to find those sentry guns Incredibly adorable?

649
00:45:36,748 --> 00:45:39,120
Rym: and now they're really bad about knocking them over.

650
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,440
Scott: They made him that way on purpose, but I do not feel bad about knocking them over.

651
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,527
Rym: I felt really bad even though they didn't blame me.

652
00:45:44,547 --> 00:45:46,815
Scott: Yeah, I don't blame you.

653
00:45:46,836 --> 00:45:52,960
Rym: I Think you know that that was part of the only thing they didn't say that they should have said was it's a living?

654
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:54,748
Rym: Yeah, that would have been perfect.

655
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:55,532
Rym: I think I would have just.

656
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:56,236
Scott: I think you know.

657
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:57,120
Scott: think about it though, right?

658
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,560
Scott: That was supposed to be making sentry guns like you know for military purposes.

659
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:03,668
Scott: So think about that.

660
00:46:03,688 --> 00:46:11,976
Scott: on the eerie sci-fi level someone was making Weapons that were sort of nice to actually use as real weapons out in a battlefield.

661
00:46:12,016 --> 00:46:12,959
Rym: Where are you?

662
