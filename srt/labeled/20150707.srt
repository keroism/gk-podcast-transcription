1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,932
Rym: It's Tuesday July 7th, 2015.

2
00:00:12,932 --> 00:00:13,474
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,115
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:15,740
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,412
Rym: Ray and Eric and Izzie's Lost Cities.

6
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:19,799
Scott: Also known as Rym Cheats.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,763
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:29,790
Rym: We had a... I'm not cheating, I'm winning.

9
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:34,250
Rym: So we had a 4th of July party that was notable in one way.

10
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:43,930
Rym: When we first moved, well when I first moved to New York City which wasn't too long after Scott moved down here the 4th of July fireworks were on the East River.

11
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,866
Rym: Like right next to my apartment and all up and down.

12
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:47,529
Rym: Like right there.

13
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:51,390
Rym: And then every other year after that I don't remember that.

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,950
Scott: I remember them being in 2009.

15
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,860
Scott: I'm pretty sure they were in the Hudson River.

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,519
Rym: But they had them for many many years in a row over next to New Jersey for no good reason.

17
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,894
Rym: And New York City has finally taken them back.

18
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:14,959
Rym: and let me tell you there were barges all the way up and down the East River and they were all synchronized and that was one hell of a firework show from the roof.

19
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:16,683
Rym: So yeah.

20
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:17,969
Rym: We had our awesome party.

21
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:22,319
Rym: We played some games that we're going to do a separate GeekNights show about after we do a little more research.

22
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:28,140
Rym: And Scott is distracted because his iPad broke I guess so he doesn't have his...

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,620
Scott: It's hard for me to do the show without my iPad so I'm using my iPhone.

24
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:34,471
Rym: If only you had a reliable Android device.

25
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:36,100
Rym: It would just mysteriously stop working.

26
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:37,780
Scott: Yeah, so mysterious.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,051
Rym: Yeah, well what happened to it?

28
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:39,720
Rym: Why did it stop working?

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,020
Scott: It was a hardware failure.

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,120
Rym: So you can get a new one for free or you're just fucked?

31
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:45,494
Scott: I didn't pay for AppleCare because that shit's a ripoff.

32
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:46,319
Scott: You shouldn't pay for it.

33
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:48,280
Rym: And now you got to buy a brand new iPad.

34
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,220
Scott: I was going to buy a brand new iPad anyway.

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,420
Rym: In September, now you're going to not have an iPad until September?

36
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,197
Scott: Yeah, I can live without it.

37
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:57,240
Rym: So we kind of needed it this weekend.

38
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,605
Scott: That's the only time I needed it.

39
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:02,360
Scott: If it broke next week I wouldn't have even thought about dealing with it.

40
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:12,696
Rym: In other news, because this is the opening vid, you know many of you new listeners to GeekNights we kind of talk about stuff in the beginning and I promise not to talk about a certain topic for the rest of the year in the opening vid.

41
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,039
Rym: But my left eye has been twitching for like three days.

42
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:19,473
Rym: The eyelid?

43
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,020
Rym: Or the eye?

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,598
Rym: The eyelid.

45
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,243
Rym: I've had that.

46
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:22,931
Scott: But I haven't had it for three days.

47
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:24,720
Scott: I've had it for like an hour here maybe.

48
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,999
Rym: Yep, it's coming and going but pretty much three days.

49
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,340
Rym: And usually that only happens if I drink like way too much garana or something.

50
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:32,676
Rym: I don't know.

51
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:34,384
Scott: There's a thing.

52
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,316
Scott: It's supposed to happen when you're old but I guess...

53
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:38,808
Rym: Maybe we're old.

54
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:40,099
Rym: There was just that article on Slashdot.

55
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:40,889
Scott: Real old.

56
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,619
Scott: Like grandpa old.

57
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,880
Rym: Talking about how some people when they're 40 they look like they're 60 and some people when they're 80 look like they're 40.

58
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,780
Rym: Apparently there's a pretty well... People do just straight up age at different rates.

59
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,498
Rym: Well they don't know what the cause is.

60
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,579
Scott: Pretty sure it's just genetic.

61
00:02:56,202 --> 00:03:01,560
Rym: But the people who look older when they're young, in terms of health, they basically are older.

62
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,942
Rym: They might as well be 70 or 80.

63
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:07,480
Rym: It's not just that some people age differently in looks.

64
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:12,220
Rym: If you look way old when you're young you're probably also actually effectively old.

65
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,281
Rym: So yeah.

66
00:03:14,763 --> 00:03:15,165
Rym: Game nine.

67
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:15,768
Rym: Tuesday.

68
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:18,339
Rym: Low energy here on Scott's side it sounds like.

69
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,798
Rym: So you got any news?

70
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:26,382
Scott: They announced the Spiel des Jahres winners for 2015.

71
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:28,679
Scott: In between the last time we did a Tuesday episode and now.

72
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,980
Scott: And they're games I never played.

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,014
Scott: The winner was Cult Express.

74
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:33,639
Scott: Never played it.

75
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,620
Scott: The Kenner Spiel winner was Broom Service which is a cool name but I never played it.

76
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,803
Scott: I don't know anything about it.

77
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,349
Scott: The kids game was Spinderella.

78
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:42,554
Scott: Another fun name.

79
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:43,216
Scott: Never played it.

80
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,160
Scott: Don't know anything about it.

81
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,720
Rym: The thing is I guess it's fine because a lot of times there are so many tabletop games.

82
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:55,740
Rym: That pretty much I wait until the Spiel des Jahres are announced and then I check out those specific games and I pretty much ignore the rest.

83
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,040
Scott: Yeah but I think this is one of those awards where they hand it out every year no matter what.

84
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:05,269
Scott: And most awards are like that.

85
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:07,600
Scott: They give out the awards every single year no matter what.

86
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,260
Rym: The Oscars should have a none of the above for best picture.

87
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:11,304
Scott: Well right.

88
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:13,953
Scott: I think that you need some awards like that.

89
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,996
Scott: Not for giving out awards that you deserve to be awarded but just for the sake of history.

90
00:04:23,057 --> 00:04:24,300
Scott: people can look back and say.

91
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:26,025
Scott: Ah look.

92
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:29,280
Scott: This was the best in that year and this was the best in that year.

93
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,880
Scott: If you just don't have a winner then when someone looks it up they'll be like wow.

94
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,307
Scott: All they know is that everything sucked that year.

95
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,618
Scott: You learn a lot more if you say wow that was the best that year.

96
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:39,060
Scott: Whoa.

97
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:41,687
Rym: We learned a lot a while ago like months ago.

98
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:46,960
Rym: We were arguing about movies and things and then we went back and we looked at best picture year by year.

99
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:50,680
Rym: And there was in fact like this ten year run of amazing movies.

100
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,888
Scott: Yes there was.

101
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:53,319
Scott: No there isn't.

102
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,649
Rym: There's still some good movies.

103
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:55,939
Scott: As long as it's in the sea.

104
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,883
Scott: But it's not like you.

105
00:04:56,923 --> 00:05:01,660
Scott: look at every movie that came out in that year and it's like wow every single movie that came out that year was incredible.

106
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,521
Scott: Anyway.

107
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:12,340
Scott: so I think that we need you know because the other thing that happens when you have annual awards is you have like two masterpieces come out at the same time.

108
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:15,000
Scott: And you can only give the award to one of them right.

109
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:24,380
Scott: So I feel like for every category of awards that's out there for everything that's being awarded you need to have awards of both types.

110
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,720
Scott: You need to have the award where we give this out every year to the best no matter what it is even if it's garbage.

111
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:31,132
Scott: It's just the best that year.

112
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:31,999
Scott: That was an awful year.

113
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:37,120
Scott: And you need to have another award which is you award it when there's a masterpiece.

114
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,779
Scott: If there's five masterpieces at once you just give out five of them.

115
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,200
Scott: And if everything sucks you just give out none.

116
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,560
Rym: You could go one step further.

117
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,125
Scott: There's no time when you give them out.

118
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:51,480
Scott: It's when something worthy appears you bestow the award upon it.

119
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,959
Scott: Sort of like how the queen knights people.

120
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,475
Scott: It's sort of like there's someone worthy of being knighted.

121
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:56,099
Scott: You're knighted.

122
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:56,926
Scott: Why don't we just do it?

123
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:00,331
Rym: Why don't we just do it?

124
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,340
Rym: Why don't we just make that our thing?

125
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,160
Rym: Penny Arcade used to do the wear/write awards.

126
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,599
Scott: Yeah but that was an annual thing.

127
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:06,780
Scott: And they were only mostly right.

128
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,979
Rym: So why don't we just do it and award our...

129
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,738
Scott: Geek Knights Awards?

130
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,960
Rym: Yeah the Geek Knights Awards.

131
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:15,199
Scott: Whenever something is worthy of an award we give it one.

132
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,319
Scott: Instead of having a show that's like the award show we go.

133
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:18,983
Scott: Oh!

134
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:21,978
Scott: Something appeared that is worthy of a Geek Knights Award.

135
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:22,319
Scott: Here it is.

136
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:23,358
Rym: I would do three.

137
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,804
Rym: So here's what I'd do.

138
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:29,879
Rym: You have one award which is every year this was the best game or the best game in that category of this year.

139
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:38,339
Rym: And then there's a separate discussion of is that game better than the best game that's ever won that award in history.

140
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,220
Rym: So every year it's like the best game this year in worker placement was this game.

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,519
Rym: And the best worker placement game of all time...

142
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:55,360
Scott: The problem is you can't be award giver outer unless you've played or for board games for example every single fucking board game right?

143
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,340
Rym: Yeah because the Oscars people watch all those movies.

144
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,200
Scott: You know they should right?

145
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,818
Scott: But they don't.

146
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,439
Scott: But that's the thing is I don't want to be... I can't simultaneously say hey their Oscars are bullshit which they are.

147
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:12,340
Scott: And that be one of the reasons if I'm giving out an award where I'm also bullshit.

148
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,600
Scott: I have to not be bullshit.

149
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,893
Rym: Why don't we just claim the awards like the Geek Knights?

150
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,060
Rym: we're full of bullshit awards.

151
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,960
Scott: Because then that won't be what I'm talking about.

152
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,339
Scott: We could do that but that won't be what I'm discussing right now.

153
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,240
Scott: That would be something entirely different which might be okay.

154
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,780
Rym: Well it's also trouble if you do the cumulative thing.

155
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,382
Rym: It's like alright.

156
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,991
Rym: so Puerto Rico and Tigris and Euphrates.

157
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:32,420
Rym: is one of them objectively better than the other one?

158
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,453
Scott: It doesn't matter they're both masterpieces.

159
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:35,420
Scott: they both get the award.

160
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,320
Rym: Yes but if you do the cumulative thing it's hard to say which one is the master.

161
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,440
Scott: You don't need to say that that's pointless.

162
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
Rym: Yeah but that's the kind of thing the nerds actually care about more.

163
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,259
Rym: Making up artificial hierarchies.

164
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,600
Rym: Nerds love the top 10 list of top 10 X's in Y just so they can argue about it.

165
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,000
Scott: The number one reason to be an awards giver outer right is so that when people who receive awards.

166
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,860
Scott: If your award is is respected then people who receive the award will then put your logo on their box.

167
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,280
Scott: Like if you you know Oscars are under suspected awards of a movie wins an Oscar.

168
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:14,820
Scott: They put Oscars on their posters on their what on their ads on TV and everything.

169
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:19,240
Scott: And then because of that that makes your award more legit.

170
00:08:19,702 --> 00:08:23,500
Scott: And now you get money just for doing this stupid awards nonsense right?

171
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,046
Scott: Suddenly you become a thing.

172
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,712
Scott: The spiel des Jahres is given out by like.

173
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,720
Scott: isn't it like a journalistic publication?

174
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:39,380
Scott: So the fact that I think it is given out by a jury of German-speaking board game critics who review games released in Germany.

175
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,313
Scott: Okay but it's like you know that helps them right to be like.

176
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:44,760
Scott: I'm a spiel des Jahres judge.

177
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:51,860
Scott: And if the more people that put spiel des Jahres on boxes because it's a respected award helps them you know be respected.

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,607
Scott: This is why I remember the early days of the web.

179
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,580
Scott: people would always just like make up awards for websites.

180
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,044
Scott: Yeah and you'd get.

181
00:08:58,064 --> 00:09:00,815
Rym: remember the parsec awards and I still have this trophy.

182
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:01,860
Rym: it's sitting right here.

183
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:05,611
Scott: Yeah I think that's still around but that's no.

184
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:08,540
Rym: they stopped giving out like anime podcast and whatever.

185
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,885
Rym: So I have two trophies on my desk covered in dust.

186
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:19,656
Rym: One of them is third place in the 30 to 39 year old category at the multiple sclerosis run.

187
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:23,441
Rym: the US New York finish 5k in 2014.

188
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:29,960
Rym: And the other one is the 2007 parsec award best anime podcast GeekNights anime.

189
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:33,270
Scott: That's another thing you can do with awards.

190
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,620
Scott: is you can get people to come to a place right?

191
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,139
Scott: It's like hey.

192
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:36,821
Rym: I know they didn't.

193
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:47,860
Rym: I point out when we won this parsec award everyone who was nominated in that category was there and then they announced that we won and no one went up to get the award.

194
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,780
Scott: I don't know if everyone in the category was there but I'm sure someone was.

195
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:57,000
Rym: Everyone who was nominated and met like in the end was there because they all gave me shit about it and I was like what?

196
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:05,580
Scott: The point is if you have an awards thing you can make it an event you can get a TV deal you can get people to stay in a hotel you can make some money right?

197
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,960
Rym: Yeah so maybe we should do the masterpiece thing and forget all the other kinds of awards.

198
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:12,792
Rym: The certified list.

199
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:13,580
Rym: it's like the steam list.

200
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:14,219
Scott: What's your news?

201
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,220
Rym: So I got two news that are the same news because they prove a point.

202
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:25,980
Rym: So way back there was Twitch plays Pokemon which was an important like I'm not even joking an important cultural phenomenon and kind of an amazing thing.

203
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,665
Rym: Like that was a very cool thing.

204
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:33,935
Rym: that happened and separately not that long ago in fact on April 1st.

205
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:36,480
Rym: so a few months ago a subreddit appeared.

206
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,843
Rym: I got I paid attention to the subreddit.

207
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:43,731
Rym: some people did some people didn't and in fact you can see the record forever of who did pay attention who didn't.

208
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:49,500
Rym: but a button appeared on this subreddit and the button was counting down from 60 seconds to zero.

209
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:57,818
Rym: If you click the button it reset the timer to 60 and you could never ever click that button again ever.

210
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,600
Scott: Did we discuss this already?

211
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,668
Rym: So barely we didn't talk about it that much because Scott just clicked it right away and whatever.

212
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:08,640
Rym: so people kept it going for a long time.

213
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:11,985
Rym: In fact it ended the 5th of June.

214
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:21,180
Rym: so a human being or a script that a human being wrote that only had one chance maybe two or three chances if you had multiple accounts to like spam Reddit.

215
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:31,076
Rym: A human being clicked this button by one means or another every at least every 60 seconds from April 1st to June 5th at 2150.55 UTC.

216
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:37,230
Rym: And now it's over and you just can't click the button.

217
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,253
Rym: and that's it like literally.

218
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:39,999
Rym: that's it and it was a super cool thing.

219
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,180
Rym: Both of these things were super cool and in gaming whenever someone does something clever like remember Salty Bet?

220
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:50,340
Rym: Salty Bet was the most amazing thing ever until everyone got tired of it.

221
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:50,960
Scott: For like 10 minutes.

222
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,360
Rym: Yeah like who even pays attention to it anymore?

223
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:53,960
Scott: It was good for a few months actually.

224
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:57,878
Rym: Yeah like we'd be doing the show and we'd just have it out in the corner kind of half watching it.

225
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,606
Rym: But these things these flashes in the pan are super important.

226
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:13,759
Rym: but my moral my lesson to you is if you see a thing like that a cultural gaming phenomenon event and you think hey what if I do that?

227
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,160
Rym: but?

228
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,240
Rym: Just stop right there because everyone who tries to do the same thing again just fails.

229
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:30,440
Rym: And I don't know why this is making the news everywhere but Twitch plays Metal Gear Solid whatever on the Game Boy Color is like in all the gaming news sites today.

230
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:33,499
Scott: It must be a slow news day.

231
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,674
Rym: So I went and checked it out and one there's 180 people watching it.

232
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,641
Scott: It's a slow news day.

233
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:40,043
Scott: one gaming site posted.

234
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,748
Scott: the other gaming sites copied it because the first one posted it.

235
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:53,800
Rym: And pretty much no one watched any of them but the original one.

236
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,839
Scott: I watched the fish play Street Fighter a little bit.

237
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,666
Rym: A little bit.

238
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:57,679
Rym: A little bit.

239
00:12:57,923 --> 00:12:58,599
Rym: In five minutes.

240
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,680
Rym: Yeah five minutes moderately amusing.

241
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:09,380
Rym: Twitch plays Pokemon and the button were different because all the hundreds of thousands of people who paid attention to that were all paying attention at the exact same time.

242
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,540
Rym: So a community formed around that thing.

243
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,280
Rym: Salty Bet formed a community that lasted as long as Salty Bet lasted.

244
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,366
Rym: That Reddit button.

245
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:21,180
Rym: There are people who live on that subreddit now basically.

246
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:26,620
Rym: This Metal Gear Solid thing and all the copycats will never have a community.

247
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,159
Rym: The other interesting thing is the people who are promoting this and trying to make it happen.

248
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:38,460
Rym: Metal Gear Solid on the Game Boy Color is possibly the worst possible game to do this for.

249
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:43,900
Rym: There is literally no way they can actually beat the game unless one person is in the chat alone.

250
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,620
Rym: I mean the game requires timing and stuff.

251
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:51,060
Rym: And watching this chat, it's just kind of really sad.

252
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,518
Rym: And everyone is really unhappy here.

253
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,310
Rym: Anyway, things of the day!

254
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,610
Rym: This is a, well it's a Google Doc with a bunch of animated gifs in it.

255
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:16,046
Rym: But it's basically an essay by Ite Karen, the owner of that studio that made that cool mushroom game.

256
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:17,810
Rym: we played at the sheep's meow thing way back.

257
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,365
Rym: You remember that?

258
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,179
Rym: You paying attention?

259
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:22,763
Rym: You doing the show?

260
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:23,750
Rym: What's going on over there?

261
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,349
Scott: I'm remembering my thing of the day.

262
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:32,050
Rym: So this is a cool game where you erase part of your fungus and then the fungus sort of grows from its other parts.

263
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:32,702
Scott: Oh yeah, I played that.

264
00:14:32,723 --> 00:14:33,030
Scott: I remember.

265
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,450
Rym: It was this really cool puzzle game.

266
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:43,192
Rym: So this is an essay that was basically presented as a talk at GDC 2015.

267
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:55,130
Rym: And it is a very, very, very in-depth mathematical detailed examination of basically every possible way to scroll your 2D game that may or may not involve scrolling.

268
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:08,590
Rym: This is super detailed and anytime someone makes a crapo game on a phone or something or a platformer or cheetahmen and it's bad, it's because of this stuff.

269
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:14,550
Rym: This stuff is one of the most important things when it comes to any 2D game that involves motion.

270
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:17,170
Scott: Just do it the way Super Metroid does it.

271
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,038
Rym: No, because Super Metroid does what it does.

272
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,370
Rym: Super Metroid is an example here for very specific reasons.

273
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,530
Scott: Yeah, because you go in the door and it loads the next room and unloads the previous room, right?

274
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:29,460
Rym: No, they're not talking about that kind of scrolling.

275
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,209
Rym: They're talking about within each zone.

276
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,474
Rym: It's the walking scrolling.

277
00:15:33,494 --> 00:15:37,344
Rym: Do you use a lerp smoother or a straight up position lock?

278
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,610
Rym: Do you just lock the guy to the center of the screen?

279
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,641
Scott: Yeah, Super Metroid, you only push the screen when you get closer to one of the edges.

280
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:46,050
Scott: You can move around the middle without scrolling anything.

281
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:53,330
Rym: So like Mario 1, the good example is, it keeps you at the center of the screen, but depending on when you backtrack, it doesn't move it quite the same way.

282
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,497
Rym: They call it the speed up push zone.

283
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:59,670
Rym: So this does say it gives you a name for every kind of scrolling.

284
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,970
Rym: And it gives you an animated gif that makes it extremely obvious what they're talking about.

285
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,750
Rym: And you're going to feel kind of dumb that you didn't notice some of this stuff.

286
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:15,250
Rym: A lot of games that seem really similar have way different scrolling and because it's implemented well, you don't even realize what the game's doing.

287
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,112
Rym: And it's brilliant.

288
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:21,630
Rym: Like here, Donkey Kong Country, lerp smoothing, position locking, region based, anchor, dual forward focus.

289
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:23,790
Scott: Yeah, Nintendo gets everything right.

290
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:29,450
Rym: Most of these games are Nintendo games or modern indie games by really smart people.

291
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:34,090
Scott: See, this is the kind of thing that Nintendo always gets right, which is why their games take so goddamn long to make.

292
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,950
Scott: And why when you play a Nintendo game, even if it's not a good game for other reasons, it just works.

293
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,770
Scott: As opposed to you get some indie game, you're like, man, this feels kind of janky.

294
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,837
Scott: It's like that's because they got this sort of thing wrong.

295
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:49,490
Scott: And not just scrolling, but also the jumping, shooting, etc.

296
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:55,530
Rym: So, like, really, if you think you're designing games, you want video ball is taking a long time.

297
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,981
Scott: Why is this triangle shooting each other?

298
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:58,110
Scott: Because they're getting this thing right.

299
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:58,651
Rym: Yeah.

300
00:16:59,014 --> 00:17:01,410
Rym: I mean, well, I think I'll talk about later.

301
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,579
Rym: But seriously, you should if you're a game designer, you should.

302
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:07,349
Rym: you should read this entire essay top to bottom.

303
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:13,910
Rym: And you should reference these animated gifs on a regular basis of your video game developer, not necessarily game design.

304
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,384
Rym: Anyway, video game designer to maybe designing the game.

305
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:18,690
Rym: How is it supposed to scroll?

306
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,092
Rym: What do you do?

307
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:20,018
Rym: What's the game's focus?

308
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:20,621
Rym: How's it working?

309
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,109
Rym: Stuff matters.

310
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:29,830
Scott: So little are traveled 60 meters while limbo dancing on roller skates.

311
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,156
Scott: A record setter dot com world record.

312
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:37,150
Scott: She remained under six inch bars for the duration of the attempt.

313
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,625
Scott: This attempt may have been broken to check the current status.

314
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:41,249
Scott: Visit this URL.

315
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:45,303
Scott: The here's a YouTube video showing the successful attempt.

316
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,250
Rym: The video kind of amazing.

317
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:49,411
Scott: Yeah.

318
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:50,836
Scott: You can't do this now.

319
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:51,237
Scott: You can't.

320
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,647
Scott: No, I don't think any of you could even limbo under a 12 inch bar.

321
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,149
Rym: Me attempting to do this would resolve my death.

322
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:00,294
Rym: What can I limbo?

323
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:03,810
Scott: I think you would just sort of roller skate and then fall forward on the ground and be done.

324
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,311
Rym: How?

325
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:05,314
Rym: I think you'd fall backward.

326
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,641
Scott: I mean, she goes forward.

327
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:08,804
Scott: Yeah.

328
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:10,610
Rym: So what are the official rules of limbo?

329
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,057
Rym: What style of limbo is this?

330
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,323
Scott: I think it's just.

331
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:14,550
Scott: you had to be on roller skates.

332
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:14,911
Scott: Yeah.

333
00:18:15,614 --> 00:18:18,284
Scott: And you got to skate forward as far as you can.

334
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:19,850
Scott: But you have to remain.

335
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:30,230
Scott: Your body has to remain not touching the ground except for the bottom of the skates and also not touching the bars above you that are, you know, maintaining your low height.

336
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,298
Scott: You can get your body loaded the ground by any means necessary.

337
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,450
Scott: But considering human anatomy, you know, ignoring freaks of nature.

338
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:39,558
Rym: I feel like the people.

339
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:41,510
Scott: This seems to be the best way to do it.

340
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,277
Rym: I feel like maybe the people who are good at this are.

341
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:49,490
Scott: it's the genetic advantage advantage partially contortionism and also being a small child.

342
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:55,470
Rym: So in the moment, the book club book is still the wheel of time.

343
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,723
Scott: And oh, the world.

344
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,230
Rym: It's a fantasy book.

345
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:02,841
Rym: And they got to a fantasy town.

346
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:04,189
Rym: And now they're in a fantasy in.

347
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:05,813
Rym: Have you gotten that far?

348
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,516
Rym: Have you read any?

349
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:08,281
Scott: I think I'm almost at the fantasy town.

350
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,910
Scott: I'm like, I'm like, I'm like on the road right behind that town.

351
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,960
Rym: Did they get to go through the gates of a town yet?

352
00:19:13,442 --> 00:19:14,186
Scott: No, they're getting to it.

353
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:15,070
Rym: Oh, all right.

354
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,524
Rym: There's not that there's not that much travel between the boat thing.

355
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:18,905
Scott: They are.

356
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:19,870
Scott: They finished the boat thing.

357
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,211
Rym: Yeah.

358
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:21,034
Rym: You're almost at the town.

359
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:22,038
Rym: Yeah.

360
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,186
Rym: All I got to say is the main character is OK.

361
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,199
Rym: His two dumb ass friends.

362
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,446
Rym: Like, I really just.

363
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:29,030
Scott: Why are they even?

364
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,033
Scott: Why are they even there?

365
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:31,921
Rym: I would like them to die.

366
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:33,950
Rym: I imagine they will.

367
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,893
Scott: They don't do anything.

368
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:38,685
Scott: I don't even know which one's which one with the ax and the one with the bow.

369
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:40,270
Rym: Matt, I think is the dumb one.

370
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,435
Scott: Is he the ax or the bow?

371
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:42,721
Rym: I don't know, but he's the dumb one.

372
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:44,690
Scott: The ax one's the better, smarter one, I think.

373
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,131
Scott: Yeah.

374
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,118
Rym: The guy named Matt is the dumb one.

375
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:49,266
Rym: I'm pretty sure because he just.

376
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:50,470
Rym: I just want him to shut up.

377
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:57,390
Rym: I really you know, it's funny maybe because I'm reading this because the book is like I could see if you're a kid who doesn't live in a big city and you're reading this book.

378
00:19:57,871 --> 00:20:00,278
Rym: It's definitely like, oh, I wish I could go on a journey like this.

379
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,770
Rym: Oh, man, that warden guy is so scary or the water or whatever.

380
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:11,090
Rym: But me as an adult reading this book, I really sympathize with the eyes today and the warden.

381
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,974
Rym: And I really don't like the kids.

382
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:18,329
Rym: Yeah, I I would basically be the guy with the sword yelling at them to shut up the whole book.

383
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,571
Scott: Pretty much.

384
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:28,470
Rym: Yeah, we are going to be live at Connecticut 2015 this weekend in like two days.

385
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:29,413
Scott: Oh, shit.

386
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:34,970
Rym: On Thursday night, there are a few panels in the Marriott and you don't want to do that shit.

387
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,150
Rym: No, if you're going there, because as much as I want them to mail the badges, they don't mail the badges yet.

388
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,179
Rym: You can pick up your badges on Thursday, like most of the day.

389
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,183
Scott: Great.

390
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:45,350
Rym: And there are like four panels on Thursday.

391
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,556
Rym: And you don't even need a badge to see.

392
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:47,781
Rym: I'm totally open to the public.

393
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:49,670
Rym: Oh, so that's cool.

394
00:20:50,210 --> 00:21:03,550
Rym: I am at least and we'll see if Scott wants to join me or not at six thirty p.m.. And people being really mad about the fact that we told some cold, hard truths about why no one will game.

395
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:10,870
Scott: Maybe I'll show up and sit on stage while you do that panel to an audience of zero and eat a DiBella sandwich.

396
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,694
Rym: I suspect I'll have you.

397
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:17,610
Rym: should the panel just be the two of us just eat a DiBella sandwich and be in love and just be like, you're assuming you're getting a sandwich.

398
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:19,459
Rym: I really hope you get me a sandwich.

399
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,248
Rym: I'll be really sad if you don't.

400
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,590
Scott: Should I take after my uncle who doesn't show up with a sandwich when you give him tickets to the All-Star?

401
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,255
Rym: Do you want to be that guy?

402
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:28,418
Scott: My uncle?

403
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:28,899
Rym: Yeah.

404
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:29,982
Scott: He's not bad guy.

405
00:21:30,263 --> 00:21:31,828
Scott: No, he just doesn't get you a sandwich.

406
00:21:31,848 --> 00:21:32,429
Rym: He's a bad guy.

407
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,490
Rym: On Saturday, we're skipping Friday because we do kind of run the whole panels department.

408
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,332
Rym: So we have work to do Saturday.

409
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:50,390
Rym: We're doing analyzing anime Utena, the history of losing Five Nights at Freddy's live with our boss at Connecticut, the director of all programming who's never played those games before.

410
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:51,895
Scott: Matt is actually going to do that.

411
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:52,577
Scott: Oh, Kristen.

412
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:52,918
Scott: Yeah.

413
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:56,690
Rym: Oh, why Five Nights at Freddy's is scary and foreign anime.

414
00:21:56,991 --> 00:21:58,074
Scott: You're going to get mad to them.

415
00:21:58,114 --> 00:21:58,616
Scott: Like, really?

416
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:01,385
Rym: Now, I would like to see Matt play that game.

417
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:02,308
Scott: He's probably has.

418
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:02,770
Rym: Yeah, I don't.

419
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,592
Rym: We'll see if he has.

420
00:22:03,993 --> 00:22:05,317
Rym: Maybe we'll trick him into coming into the room.

421
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:06,722
Rym: We'll see.

422
00:22:06,963 --> 00:22:07,885
Scott: You can even find him.

423
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,230
Rym: Yeah, I know.

424
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,128
Rym: Finding him is a lot harder than finding like a kahil at a PAX.

425
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:14,530
Scott: Yeah.

426
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,490
Scott: When the convention like you see him before the convention starts, then the convention starts and he disappears.

427
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,169
Scott: And then when the convention ends, there is occasionally on the radio, you're here.

428
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:26,763
Rym: This is operations looking for Matt and then just silence.

429
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:28,590
Rym: That happens a lot.

430
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,432
Rym: It's his convention.

431
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:29,894
Scott: He owns it.

432
00:22:30,998 --> 00:22:34,590
Rym: If I have the ring convention, you're not going to see me at the convention.

433
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:36,079
Rym: I'll be there, but you won't see me.

434
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:37,750
Rym: All right.

435
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:40,978
Scott: Oh, the main bit.

436
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:41,641
Scott: Yeah.

437
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:43,850
Scott: The main bit is this game called Lost City.

438
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,266
Rym: So, Lost City is an old, old, old Reiner Knizia game that we just like knew about.

439
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:49,190
Scott: Well, I played it.

440
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,326
Scott: I knew I had played it in the past with people.

441
00:22:52,346 --> 00:22:53,190
Scott: I knew this game.

442
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,404
Scott: I knew it was a great two player game, but Rym had never played it.

443
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:57,750
Rym: And the other people play it.

444
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,695
Rym: I just kind of ignored it.

445
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,069
Rym: In fact, I owned it and didn't realize I owned it.

446
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:01,290
Scott: Right.

447
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,725
Scott: The other day, the other day, it's like, hey, let's just play a two people game.

448
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:05,750
Scott: So I go over to the closet.

449
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,141
Scott: We're looking and I see lost cities in there.

450
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:09,990
Scott: I'm like, hey, I haven't played lost cities in a couple of years.

451
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,638
Scott: That game is an amazing two player game.

452
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:12,302
Scott: Let's play that.

453
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:13,809
Scott: And Rym hadn't played it and he owned it.

454
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,153
Scott: So we took it out.

455
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:18,930
Scott: I reread the rules and we played and we've been playing it a whole bunch.

456
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,678
Scott: Because you remembered how amazing it was.

457
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:22,608
Scott: My memory was absolutely correct.

458
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:23,110
Scott: It's amazing.

459
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,600
Rym: I want to point out, Scott taught me the game.

460
00:23:24,661 --> 00:23:25,749
Rym: And remember, we just did that show.

461
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:30,730
Rym: We're talking about Wil Wheaton and tabletop, how even professionals like us will like mess up the rules.

462
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,056
Scott: I got the tiniest thing wrong.

463
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:34,240
Rym: It's a big deal.

464
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,530
Rym: Scott is kind of a big deal when teaching me this game.

465
00:23:38,072 --> 00:23:42,110
Scott: But otherwise I was absolutely correct about all the other rules and I didn't miss any other rules.

466
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,536
Rym: However, you suck at this game.

467
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:46,101
Scott: I don't suck.

468
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:47,626
Scott: You cheat.

469
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:48,990
Scott: I just beat you just now in that one round.

470
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,757
Rym: You beat me in a one round by a few points.

471
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:56,750
Rym: Meanwhile, in every other round and game of this, I've crushed you.

472
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,136
Rym: The three we played in a row, what was my score?

473
00:23:59,176 --> 00:23:59,357
Rym: Like 280?

474
00:23:59,357 --> 00:24:02,750
Scott: I mean, there is a certain amount of luck in this game.

475
00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:04,498
Rym: Yeah, but I can't always be lucky.

476
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:06,910
Scott: You can be lucky three out of four times.

477
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,816
Rym: Especially when you're the one shuffling.

478
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:13,130
Rym: And so, Lost Cities is actually a really, really simple game.

479
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,671
Scott: Right.

480
00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:15,198
Scott: So, there is a deck of cards.

481
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:17,065
Scott: In this deck of cards, there are five.

482
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:18,270
Scott: It's really a card game.

483
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,810
Scott: It's like it comes in a box with a board just to sort of increase the production value.

484
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:23,355
Scott: It's just a deck of cards.

485
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:27,110
Scott: But the deck of cards has the numbers two through ten in five colors.

486
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,256
Scott: Yellow, red, white, green, and blue.

487
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,550
Scott: And it has, in each color, there are also three handshake cards.

488
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,642
Scott: I don't know what they're actually called.

489
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,189
Scott: No one cares.

490
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,109
Rym: Investments.

491
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,430
Scott: Yeah, the theme of the game is you're going on expeditions.

492
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,702
Rym: Adventure into the unknown for the daring and adventurous.

493
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:46,590
Rym: There are many lost cities to find and explore.

494
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,139
Scott: Yeah, there are five different lost cities to search for.

495
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:51,790
Scott: The red one, the yellow one, the green one, the blue one, the white one.

496
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,070
Rym: Scott, you're missing the great flavor of this game.

497
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,770
Scott: No one gives a shit.

498
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,247
Rym: The search can take you to the Himalaya.

499
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,230
Rym: The white.

500
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,289
Rym: The Brazilian rainforest.

501
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,724
Scott: The green.

502
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,270
Rym: The ever-shifting sands of the desert.

503
00:25:01,692 --> 00:25:01,943
Rym: The yellow.

504
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:03,190
Rym: Ancient volcanoes.

505
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:03,567
Rym: The red.

506
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:05,329
Rym: And to Neptune's realm.

507
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,186
Scott: The blue.

508
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:08,031
Scott: Yeah.

509
00:25:08,411 --> 00:25:12,518
Scott: So, basically, you play cards in the different expeditions.

510
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:20,750
Scott: And for an expedition to pay out and give you points, you have to play enough cards for that expedition to get to the successful point, right?

511
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:27,598
Scott: If you start playing cards in an expedition, but you don't play enough to make it successful, you lose a bunch of points.

512
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:37,330
Scott: because you went out and geared up and went to Neptune's realm, and you didn't really find anything there, and you just went your ass back home, and you just wasted a bunch of money, so you lose points.

513
00:25:37,811 --> 00:25:42,290
Scott: If you don't even try, you don't play any cards of a certain color, then it's just a zero.

514
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,033
Rym: So, basically, think of it this way.

515
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:54,130
Rym: The game is all about risk management, risk aversion, and reading the other player and their discards, and managing the deck timer.

516
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:54,650
Scott: Right.

517
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,720
Rym: Because, basically, what you do is you draw a card, play a card.

518
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,210
Rym: Well, you play a card, draw a card, actually.

519
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,109
Scott: That's the worst part.

520
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,931
Rym: It's like a battle line.

521
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:02,112
Rym: You gotta play something.

522
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:04,254
Rym: Gotta play something.

523
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:18,588
Rym: And your only option is either to discard on the top of a color in the middle, and then the other person on their turn could choose to draw that as their draw, or play it in one of the piles, and now you're locked in.

524
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:20,290
Rym: That pile's gonna score.

525
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:28,429
Rym: If you ignore a color completely, it never scores, but if you put even one card down there, you could get up to negative 60 points.

526
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,310
Scott: That's a lot of negative points.

527
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:30,945
Scott: Yeah, it is.

528
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,332
Scott: If you play the wrong things.

529
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:32,612
Scott: Yeah.

530
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:37,980
Scott: So, and the other thing is, so let's say you play down, you know, handshakes have to come first.

531
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,706
Scott: If you play one handshake in a column, that doubles the score.

532
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:45,190
Scott: Even if it's a negative score, it'll be negative doubled.

533
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:48,962
Scott: So, if you just play one handshake, that score is negative 20, negative 40, right?

534
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,751
Rym: Yep.

535
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:56,020
Rym: But you have to play the handshake first before you play anything else.

536
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,890
Scott: So, like, if you play the number three, and then you draw a handshake, the handshake's useless if it's the same color.

537
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,232
Rym: So, here are the actual rules.

538
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:03,375
Rym: The game is really simple.

539
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:04,538
Rym: You have, like, a hand of eight.

540
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:05,521
Rym: Both of you have a hand of eight.

541
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:09,110
Rym: The oldest player goes first, so I always go first, I guess.

542
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,069
Scott: Older by, like, two months and change.

543
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,552
Rym: But older nonetheless.

544
00:27:13,073 --> 00:27:14,555
Rym: The rules are very explicit.

545
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:15,556
Rym: We're not going to mess up the rules.

546
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:25,370
Rym: And on your turn, you either play a card onto one of the colors, or you discard a card into the middle on one of the colors, covering up any cards that are already discarded.

547
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,920
Rym: Then, you draw a card, either from those discards or from the top of the deck.

548
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:37,630
Rym: And play continues until someone draws the last card in the deck, meaning every card has been drawn.

549
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:39,534
Rym: You then immediately score.

550
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:45,585
Rym: And before you do all of this, you agree how many rounds you're going to play.

551
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:47,850
Rym: The game says three is a good number.

552
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:48,790
Scott: Yeah.

553
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:56,570
Scott: I mean, the reason you play rounds is because while the game isn't, you know, super luck-based, I mean, it's still got some luck involved, right?

554
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,576
Scott: You could theoretically get some awful draw.

555
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:06,670
Scott: that's, like, unplayable, and you end up with no score, even though you played as well as you possibly could.

556
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:14,710
Scott: So, you mitigate that by playing a few rounds, and then all the luck is washed out in, you know, the multi-round play, and you see who's really better at the game.

557
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,416
Rym: Now, that's pretty straightforward, but as Scott said when he was teaching it to me, then there's a Kinesia twist.

558
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:21,559
Rym: Because remember, this is Rainer of Kinesia.

559
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:29,790
Rym: You know, Amun-Re, Battle Line, Ra, through the desert, modern art, there's always a Kinesia twist.

560
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:36,843
Rym: The twist is, for each color, the score you get is one, like Scott said, multiplied by two.

561
00:28:36,863 --> 00:28:40,130
Rym: Well, it's multiplied by one plus the number of handshakes you've played.

562
00:28:41,651 --> 00:28:50,090
Rym: And, before you multiply, or add your score together, you subtract twenty from the total face value of all the cards' sum.

563
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:57,130
Rym: So, if I play a four, five, and a ten, that's nineteen, so that's a negative one on that row.

564
00:28:57,591 --> 00:29:02,546
Scott: And if you get three handshakes, that's four times negative one, so negative four.

565
00:29:03,248 --> 00:29:03,710
Scott: That's bad.

566
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:11,187
Scott: And think about it, it's really hard to get to twenty when you've got, in the deck, cards numbered two through ten, and that's it.

567
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:12,230
Scott: One of each.

568
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:21,504
Rym: Oh, and did I mention, you have to play the cards on their correct color, of course, and you must always raise the value of your pile.

569
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:24,990
Rym: You must always play a higher card than any previous card you've played.

570
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,338
Scott: Right, so you play the two, and then you play the five.

571
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,064
Scott: You can never play the three or the four ever.

572
00:29:29,104 --> 00:29:30,590
Scott: There's no way to pick up that five.

573
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:35,290
Rym: And that's when Rym immediately discards the three and four he's been holding on to, and now you can't draw them.

574
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,904
Scott: Right, so it's like, on the one hand, you know, I could try to hold out to get the three and four.

575
00:29:40,924 --> 00:29:42,208
Scott: Maybe they're in the deck, I don't know.

576
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:42,830
Scott: Rym has them.

577
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:55,230
Scott: But if I assume he has them, even if I say, well, he has them, there's no point in holding out for them, because I won't get them, I'll just play my five, that now frees his hand up, and he can now finally discard them.

578
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:01,330
Scott: If I had maybe held out longer, he might have been forced to discard them, just to do something, and given me a play.

579
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,034
Rym: There is one other rule, and this is the rule that Scott forgot.

580
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:14,070
Rym: If you play eight or more cards in a pile, then after you do all the scoring, you get twenty additional points.

581
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:21,750
Scott: Right, so you can play, you know, it might be hard to get over twenty if you don't get the big cards, like someone might be holding them out on you.

582
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:25,690
Rym: I think if you play eight cards, you're guaranteed to be above twenty, making it moot.

583
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,324
Scott: Yeah, well, you could...

584
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,729
Rym: Two, three, four, what Scott, what's two plus three plus four plus five plus six plus seven plus eight plus... Alright, handshake.

585
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,469
Scott: Three handshakes, two, three, four, five, six.

586
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,101
Rym: Yup.

587
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,713
Rym: That's eleven... Yup.

588
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,030
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna get positive points.

589
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:43,183
Rym: Yup.

590
00:30:44,772 --> 00:30:47,590
Scott: It won't be that, it won't be a lot though, but it'll be still a great play.

591
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:55,190
Rym: Okay, so with all this combined, like the rules make it very clear, and again, this is actually an example of really well-written rules, like you just read these things, they're beautiful.

592
00:30:57,131 --> 00:31:02,170
Rym: Your expedition, each one could be worth anywhere between negative eighty and a hundred and fifty-six.

593
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,007
Scott: There you go.

594
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,050
Rym: That's a big swing, that's a wizard swing.

595
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:10,100
Scott: Yeah, negative eighty is three handshakes and nothing else, and one fifty-six is.

596
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:14,070
Scott: you play all the cards in order perfectly in the whole set.

597
00:31:14,502 --> 00:31:14,750
Rym: Yup.

598
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:22,237
Rym: So, we've played this game a bunch, I'm pretty much the god wizard of this game, at least for now, but it's interesting.

599
00:31:22,277 --> 00:31:36,670
Rym: the interplay, like one thing I've noticed that I started trying right away, it seems like a pretty powerful strategy, is if I think Scott's not going after a color, I'll start banking cards by discarding them, because, you know, the round ends when the last card is drawn.

600
00:31:37,452 --> 00:31:41,421
Rym: So I can bank cards into the middle and draw new cards by discarding.

601
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:45,070
Rym: if I'm confident Scott will not draw those cards from the discard and use them.

602
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:57,890
Rym: Then later, if I get cards of that color, and that's actually more likely because Scott's not investing in that color, then I can just redraw those as my draws and have guaranteed points.

603
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:07,590
Scott: Well, a good way to stop this strategy if your opponent is using it is, "Oh, I see that he has begun redrawing the cards he previously discarded to sort of make a huge play in that color, let me-".

604
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,649
Rym: Yoink, there goes the six!

605
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,658
Scott: "Let me take one of the cards from that perfectly open discard pile.

606
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:14,021
Scott: so now that they cannot use it.

607
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:17,769
Scott: Oh, there's still- I'll take another one from there, just hold it in my hand where they can't get it, yes?

608
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:18,049
Scott: Thank

609
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:18,169
Scott: you.".

610
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:18,771
Rym: Yup.

611
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:25,110
Rym: But, you could twist that one step further and use that as a stalling tactic to get the other person to not finish a bigger pile of something.

612
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:25,634
Rym: Mmm.

613
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:38,925
Rym: There's a- because it's a two-player symmetric game, there is a huge amount of card counting, reading the other players' plays, bluffing, all that stuff combined.

614
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:43,070
Rym: You can take really big risks, sometimes you get fucked by those risks.

615
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:51,483
Scott: Yeah, it's like you could just, like, a lot of times you'll start a hand and in your hand you'll see something like, "White handshake, white two, white

616
00:32:51,564 --> 00:32:51,904
Scott: ten.".

617
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:55,390
Scott: And you're like, "Alright, this is gonna happen,

618
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:55,510
Scott: right?".

619
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,350
Rym: I'm going for that long inside straight.

620
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:03,662
Scott: I mean, I'm gonna get- I just need like one more- one or two white cards in the whole- this is turn one, right?

621
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:07,710
Scott: There are, I know for a fact, a lot of white cards left in the deck.

622
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:08,146
Rym: Yup.

623
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:17,670
Scott: All I need to do is see pretty much any two of them, and this will be a positive play, and I can just make easy plays at the start of the game, I can just go white handshake, white two.

624
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,825
Scott: So, of course, what happens is you play white handshake- And then Rym goes, "Three, four, six, seven,

625
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:23,329
Scott: eight.".

626
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,320
Scott: And it's like, "You just turned one!

627
00:33:25,601 --> 00:33:26,707
Rym: How could you possibly

628
00:33:26,768 --> 00:33:27,069
Rym: know?".

629
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:37,170
Scott: But, it's like, that was a somewhat reasonable risk to take, and you know what, if you didn't just get that horrible luck of, "Yeah, Rym had every white card in his hand, you just didn't know

630
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,230
Scott: it.".

631
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:39,689
Rym: Yeah, heading into the Himalayas is a horrible risk to take.

632
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:53,990
Scott: Then, you would've had, you know, you could've drawn, like, it was possible that the deck was shuffled in such a way that every other card was white, and you would've just kept drawing white cards and playing them, and played them all in order, some majestic, perfect luck, right?

633
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:55,249
Scott: It can happen, there is luck.

634
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:02,410
Scott: But, you shuffle in the cards, I mean, you can't- you can only blame it on luck three out of four times like I can.

635
00:34:03,191 --> 00:34:08,050
Rym: So, this is basically, like, one of the best two-player tabletop games I've ever seen.

636
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:13,208
Rym: So, if you need two-player tabletop games- Which everyone does.

637
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:18,849
Rym: Get this and Battle Line, 'cause they're both great and they're both Genizia, and I guess Oshii?

638
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:20,650
Scott: Sure.

639
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,478
Rym: Can you name another good two-player game?

640
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:24,309
Rym: We've played a lot of bad two-player games.

641
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:25,726
Scott: Hellas.

642
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:26,909
Scott: All the other ones ever.

643
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,670
Scott: Netrunner's a good two-player game.

644
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,869
Rym: Netrunner is a good two-player game.

645
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:30,889
Rym: Yeah.

646
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:31,456
Rym: Yeah?

647
00:34:31,842 --> 00:34:32,389
Rym: Not that many.

648
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:37,329
Scott: Yeah, Lost Cities, go find out what treasure is lying in them.

649
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,090
Rym: Alright, and on that note, we will see you at ConnectiCon, 'cause we got shit to do before the con.

650
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:43,650
Scott: Yeah, I got a lot to do, I can't sit around.

651
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:51,929
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

652
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:57,070
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

653
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:02,470
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

654
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:05,410
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

655
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,150
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

657
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,970
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

658
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,090
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
