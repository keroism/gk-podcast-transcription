1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,490
Scott: It's Tuesday, March 7th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,250
Scott: Tonight we talk about how not to suck at games in general.

3
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,428
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:24,630
Rym: I apologize if this episode may be short or slow, but we're a little tired from the weekend.

5
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,090
Scott: Yeah, this episode also might suck because I'm also tired.

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:38,690
Rym: Yeah, I mean we talked yesterday, I think we did a decent show yesterday, but one, I had quite a bit of wine in me, and two, the weekend had not hit me with full effect yet.

7
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:42,429
Rym: I'm down off of my geek high, and now I'm just tired.

8
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,009
Scott: Yup, but it's kind of funny that we're going to make an episode of How Not To Suck.

9
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:47,370
Scott: That Might Suck itself.

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,629
Rym: Yeah, especially since yesterday's episode was How Not To Suck At Podcasting.

11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,646
Scott: Yeah, see, we said we were going to do a theme week last week, but then one yesterday we decided "Oh, let's do a How Not To

12
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:57,869
Scott: Suck.".

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,690
Scott: Well, we decided, let's do both!

14
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:00,950
Scott: It's a How Not To Suck week.

15
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:13,006
Rym: Yeah, now, for anyone who's curious, the only reason we didn't do a main, normal theme week was that we had Nuri, our guest, around, and whenever we have someone around who we can have on the show, we try to have a show that they would actually have something to say on.

16
00:01:13,714 --> 00:01:14,250
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of boring.

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,302
Rym: We made that mistake early on where we'd have someone over, so hey, be on the show, and then we'd talk about something they didn't care about or didn't know about, and it didn't work.

18
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:28,450
Scott: Yeah, hey, uh, artist person, artist podcaster, yeah, let's talk about, um, video games.

19
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,528
Rym: Yeah, video games.

20
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,007
Rym: Awesome.

21
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:30,567
Rym: And food.

22
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:30,978
Scott: Yeah.

23
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:32,890
Rym: Let's talk about the Linux kernel.

24
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:33,685
Scott: Awesome.

25
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:35,348
Scott: Maybe next week.

26
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:36,386
Rym: Yeah.

27
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,089
Rym: So, uh, Scott, I hear you were playing, uh, a game as a result of the fact that you were so tired.

28
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:47,510
Scott: Yeah, see, and the fact is, uh, I'm so tired, I had to play a game where I didn't have to exert any effort whatsoever.

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,350
Scott: In fact, I could play this game in my sleep, and you may have heard of it, it's called Progress Quest.

30
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,088
Rym: It's a lot like World of Warcraft, only they really kind of streamline the process of playing the game.

31
00:01:58,511 --> 00:02:13,930
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you pretty much, you have all your stats, you roll stats, you pick a class in a race, you start out at level one, you have spells and equipment, and there's a plot, and you fight monsters, and you collect items, and, uh, that's it.

32
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,290
Scott: It's just like every other, um, RPG of leveling MMO-type game.

33
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,350
Rym: Yeah, it just takes out all the most tedious part, you know, the horrible leveling.

34
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,690
Rym: You don't have to deal with that, you can just play it.

35
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,750
Scott: Well, it has the leveling, it just doesn't have to be clicking.

36
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:26,048
Scott: Yeah, so it'll just do it.

37
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:31,110
Scott: You just, uh, you run Progress Quest, and, um, it starts to level you up.

38
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:34,409
Scott: It's pretty awesome, you should check it out.

39
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:35,121
Rym: Yeah.

40
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:42,430
Scott: I mean, it even lets you play online, you know, there's like a server that keeps track of everyone's level, and you might kill someone else if you're lucky, I think.

41
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,804
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people have, uh, little avatar sig things.

42
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:51,170
Rym: they put in their sig profiles in various, like, PHP-type BBs where it'll show how high a level you are.

43
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:51,929
Scott: Oh, really?

44
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:53,570
Rym: In semi-real time.

45
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:55,229
Scott: I didn't know about that, maybe I should get that.

46
00:02:55,491 --> 00:03:01,830
Rym: I've seen people do it, I don't know all the details of it, but I've seen people who had Progress Quest updater things in their sig.

47
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:09,510
Scott: Ooh, my encumbrance filled up, and now I'm selling all my equipment for, I'm selling all my items for gold, and now I'm gonna turn them into, uh, new equipment.

48
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,428
Scott: Let's see what comes out.

49
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,749
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, anyway, uh, it's video game day, and, uh, Scott, tell us about the pedophiles in the news.

50
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,368
Scott: So, pedophiles?

51
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,227
Rym: Yeah, 'cause this doesn't come up, you know, every other week when we're talking about the internets.

52
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:24,147
Scott: Pedophiles?

53
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:36,789
Scott: So, this one guy, you know, pedophiles seem to always come up with a crazy way to get little boys and girls, you know, like, a guy will start an ice cream truck, or maybe, like, a bookmobile, you know.

54
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:42,477
Rym: Well, I guess the thing we'll preface is that you always hear a lot of hysteria about, "Oh, the pedophiles are out there,".

55
00:03:42,698 --> 00:04:01,664
Rym: and this has been around pretty much as long as there have been pedophiles, and people worry about it a lot, and I think some people might worry about it too much, or the media, perhaps, likes to sensationalize it in order to, uh, you know, get listeners or readers, but this case here is an actual, like, "Wow, that was really a pedophile doing a scam on the internet to get kids,".

56
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:03,030
Rym: and they got him.

57
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:10,450
Scott: I mean, it does happen, you know, it's just that pedophiles are really kind of, they're kind of clever, a lot of them, you know?

58
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,549
Rym: Yeah, this is kind of scary.

59
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:16,850
Scott: So, this guy, he started a counter-strike, like, clan, I guess.

60
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,309
Rym: Yeah, like a guild for you non-FPS types.

61
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:25,029
Scott: Yeah, so, it was apparently a very good guild too, like, way, pretty, uh, good, like, the...

62
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,508
Rym: Yeah, if you play counter-strike, you might have played against them, they're called the Green Berets.

63
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,530
Scott: Yeah, I'm kinda tired, so I'm gonna explain this pretty shittily.

64
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:32,289
Rym: Oh, good game.

65
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,728
Scott: So, he went around and he recruited ten to thirteen year old boys, apparently that's what he liked.

66
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,990
Scott: In fact, this guy was actually a former convicted pedophile in Canada and was not allowed to make contact with minors.

67
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:50,110
Scott: Oh, so, uh... He was against his parole or probation or whatever he had.

68
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,010
Rym: Alright, strike one, well, I guess strike two, since strike one was being a pedophile.

69
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,151
Rym: Yeah,

70
00:04:54,191 --> 00:05:18,550
Scott: so he recruited, he went around the internet recruiting ten to thirteen year old boys, and he had them lie about their, um, age, so that he didn't get in trouble, and he had them join the guild, or clan, or whatever it's called, and then what he would do is he would say, "Hey, if you send me pictures of you naked, I'll promote you or make you a manager in the clan," or stuff.

71
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,689
Rym: Yeah, now, his second in command, and he'd kick people out who didn't comply with these requests.

72
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:30,810
Scott: Now, the second in command or someone else in the clan- A normal guy, like a nineteen, twenty-something year old guy, like a normal dude.

73
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:39,588
Rym: Yep, now he got a complaint from a kid, like, "Alright, the head of this clan just, uh, wanted me to send him naked pictures of myself, you guys are freaking weird, oh my

74
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:39,929
Rym: god.".

75
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,620
Rym: And he chalked it up as, "Wow, crazy punk kids will say anything if you kick them out of a clan,

76
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,007
Rym: whatever.".

77
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:50,848
Scott: Yeah, when you, I mean, seriously, you see what punk kids say in forums these days, they're like, "Oh, you noob, homo, blah blah blah

78
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:50,970
Scott: blah.".

79
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,785
Rym: "Oh my god, today, these are

80
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:53,188
Rym: ours.".

81
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,490
Scott: Someone says that, you don't actually think, "Oh, that guy's actually-".

82
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:04,430
Rym: Alright, so what do you do when, you know, ten kids all say the exact same thing, that your leader guy is a pedophile, who was, who propositioned him?

83
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,070
Scott: He called the police.

84
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,170
Rym: Yep, and it turned out, sure enough, he was.

85
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:09,690
Scott: And they got him.

86
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,288
Rym: And they got him.

87
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:24,355
Scott: So, um, you know, if you're looking to protect yourself from pedophiles, I don't know how old everyone here is listening, but if you're a pedophile target, or if you have pedophile targets living with you- I think more importantly,

88
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:26,730
Rym: if you're a parent who has to worry about this sort of thing.

89
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,170
Scott: Yeah, don't worry about, you know, normal stuff, like chat rooms and stuff, that's, you know, whatever.

90
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,350
Scott: Worry about, like, you know, clever places you wouldn't expect.

91
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:39,450
Rym: Yeah, that's real useful advice, Scott.

92
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,670
Rym: Because the pedophiles are clever.

93
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,710
Rym: Oh, worry about the thing you won't expect, as opposed to the thing you already expect.

94
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,390
Scott: Exactly.

95
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:45,167
Rym: Yeah.

96
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,109
Rym: Alright, so you know what?

97
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:59,090
Rym: Alright, parents, apparently, if we're gonna go by Scott's theory of avoiding pedophiles, have to worry about a pedophile getting a hot air balloon and sailing over the neighborhood with a giant crane game grappling hook, picking up children.

98
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,787
Scott: Dude, that would be the most dangerous pedophile ever, in fact, we should make a comic book about that.

99
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,809
Rym: Actually, I point out that he's not that dangerous at all, because the problem is solved with one airsoft bullet.

100
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,190
Scott: You really think that would make it all the way up to the hot air balloon?

101
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,950
Rym: Fine, fine, a gun, I don't know, I'm tired.

102
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:15,887
Scott: Yeah, me too.

103
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,528
Rym: That's a hot air balloon, you pop it.

104
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,730
Scott: Yep, just like you pop the pedophiles in the face when you-- Yeah, yeah, anyway.

105
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:23,442
Scott: Wow.

106
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,162
Rym: And now there's a siren going on outside the--.

107
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:27,370
Rym: yeah, we're real tired, we'll see how long this episode actually goes.

108
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:28,005
Rym: Alright.

109
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:35,710
Rym: Yeah, but at least our saving grace is that the reason we're tired is that we had a weekend of geek, or a geekend, if you will.

110
00:07:36,232 --> 00:07:46,427
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if this podcast was three days a week, every episode would be awesome, but we're so manly, we're gonna keep doing four days a week anyway, so you have to expect this kind of thing and deal with it.

111
00:07:47,030 --> 00:08:00,030
Rym: Yeah, well, partly because way back we asked the question to our listeners, and I guess now that we have a lot more listeners than we did way back, we'll ask again, if we're too tired to do a show, do you want us to do it anyway, or do you want us to just skip it or what?

112
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:05,030
Scott: Yep, I mean, you'll still get something, we'll do it, it just won't-- it'll be like this.

113
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:06,710
Scott: This is like the minimum quality.

114
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:09,570
Rym: Yeah, because if it's beyond this, we'd actually skip it.

115
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,410
Scott: Yeah, it's where we revert to talking about how sucky it is, that's as sucky as it gets.

116
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,269
Rym: Yeah, because beyond that we just don't record one.

117
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:22,970
Scott: So go to our forums at frontrowcrew.com and answer our question again.

118
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,810
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, I actually have a news here too, it's not about video games, but it's about the internet.

119
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:35,090
Rym: Now, there are blogs, blogs have been around for a long time, there are shills, shills have been around for a long time.

120
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,289
Scott: Oh, we know them shills.

121
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,989
Rym: Yeah, Penny Arcade broke a lot of interesting news about shills not too long ago on the internet.

122
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,328
Scott: Forum shills.

123
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:50,589
Rym: Apparently, Walmart has been effectively just hiring bloggers to spread propaganda about Walmart on their blogs.

124
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:52,050
Rym: Like openly.

125
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,729
Rym: As in, Walmart sends out emails and these bloggers post them verbatim as though they said them themselves.

126
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,710
Scott: So why are these bloggers doing this, what kind of people are they?

127
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,010
Rym: I don't know!

128
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:19,309
Rym: Actually, these bloggers are not only defending Walmart against all this legislation and against all this quote "bad propaganda" against them, but they're also really indignant to the fact that people have pointed out that they're just posting emails they get from this Walmart PR person.

129
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:30,830
Scott: See, here's the thing though, maybe these aren't actual bloggers, but just like people, Walmart, like actual employees, or maybe they're a marketing company Walmart hired that just creates blogs.

130
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,217
Scott: I mean anyone can make a blog.

131
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:38,909
Scott: if you don't know, just because there's a blog there doesn't mean there's a person who I would call a blogger on the other end.

132
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,510
Rym: Now five years ago, I would've laughed to you and called you crazy.

133
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,870
Rym: No one would put that much effort into marketing.

134
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:58,178
Rym: But as the last year or so has shown us, there are people who will quite literally create entire fake online communities and entire fake identities with the sole purpose of tricking you into thinking they're a real person so that they can then recommend a product to you.

135
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:05,668
Scott: Well, it all comes down to the fact that nowadays we have ad blocking, commercial blocking, pop-up filtering, you know.

136
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,229
Scott: No one wants to look at ads.

137
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,790
Scott: So the new thing in marketing is to not make ads because people don't like to look at them.

138
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,449
Scott: You know, it's like Google took it one step by just making, okay these are ads, they're text and they're tasteful.

139
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:26,809
Scott: They take it a step further where they say it doesn't even look like an ad, it looks like content, it is content, it just is also an ad.

140
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:30,650
Rym: Now the thing is, to me at least, chills are very easy to spot.

141
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:38,370
Rym: I mean, I actually see them fairly regularly on Slashshot and it's very obvious that wow, that guy was totally paid by a company to say that.

142
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,869
Rym: No human being would type that.

143
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,330
Scott: Yup, I know, it's very easy.

144
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:51,770
Scott: It's like, hey, that guy is recommending a very specific product and if I go in and look for that product, you know, I see something similar or it's not hard.

145
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,090
Rym: But I don't know what these marketers are thinking, they're not being clever.

146
00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:00,570
Rym: I mean, I could see if they were being clever about it, but like Walmart here, it's the same text going to all the different blogs.

147
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:09,329
Rym: So whatever the blogger says, like, this is my opinion, whatever, um, yeah, you happen to have the exact same opinion verbatim as 80 other people out there.

148
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:10,865
Rym: Outstanding.

149
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:11,809
Scott: Yeah, good job.

150
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:22,170
Scott: I mean, if someone was going to pay me to promote them on my blog, first of all, I wouldn't do it unless I actually agreed with whatever I was going to say.

151
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,610
Scott: So if Walmart came around, I'd be like, I'd say, okay, Walmart sucks.

152
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,350
Scott: But if Nintendo came around, I'd be like, all right, I'll say something good.

153
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:31,748
Scott: You know, you give me money.

154
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,590
Scott: But I'd say I was being paid.

155
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,129
Scott: You got to say you're being paid.

156
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,728
Rym: Yeah, well say Microsoft gave us Xbox 360s because they wanted us to, you know, talk good about them.

157
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:43,870
Rym: We'd take the Xbox 360s, but we'd be fairly brutally honest about them.

158
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:53,390
Scott: Yup, we'd be completely honest in whatever we said and we'd be very open about the fact that Microsoft gave us the Xbox 360s with intent for us to review them.

159
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:54,869
Rym: So awesome.

160
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:56,453
Scott: So pretty much.

161
00:11:56,553 --> 00:12:12,090
Scott: if a blogger or anyone on the internet is promoting something, you know, a product, a service, a store, a company, you know, make sure that they're not just BSing you, especially if you're in the process of making a purchasing decision.

162
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:19,470
Rym: Yeah, the easiest way to pick them out is to, usually the person posts under some sort of name, try to find other posts by the same person.

163
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:26,410
Rym: You'll often find that, wow, that guy has nothing better to do than to go to every forum on the internet and post the same message.

164
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:34,210
Scott: Of course, it's funny because like, I'll hang out in a forum and I'll just like, you know, they're the things I like and I'll try to promote them to people.

165
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:42,210
Scott: So it's like, you look at myself and you might think I'm a shill sometimes, you know, it's like, I'll be like, read sanctuary, read sanctuary, you think I work for Viz.

166
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,150
Rym: See, I can't really define it, but like I get this vibe.

167
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:51,250
Rym: You read something and you'll just think, all right, that's obviously a shill and I'm usually pretty accurate, at least as far as I can tell.

168
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,530
Rym: I mean, I very rarely can track the person down to the point of knowing with certainty.

169
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,049
Scott: Yeah, but see, it's like we go back to those people in the forums that Penny Arcade was talking about.

170
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:07,750
Scott: The whole point of that is those people, you know, mastered the art of not setting off the shill alarm by looking like legitimate people.

171
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,079
Rym: So I guess that just be very leery of any advice you get on the internet that doesn't come from us.

172
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:15,032
Scott: Yeah.

173
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:23,750
Scott: And, you know, this stuff even we were talking about before, even on TV, it might not look like a commercial, but if they're showing curling, it's a commercial for curling.

174
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:24,424
Rym: Yep.

175
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:32,484
Rym: All right.

176
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:36,400
Rym: So things of the day so we can get this Travis Deva podcast on the road.

177
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:37,883
Rym: All right.

178
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:47,328
Rym: So over the weekend, one thing that we did is our usual hobby of sit around and watch videos on Google, you know, type the word explosion and see what kinds of explosions you can find.

179
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,599
Scott: YouTube also works.

180
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:49,044
Rym: Yep.

181
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,360
Rym: Well, we found this video.

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,500
Rym: It was filmed around 2002 and it's these two guys.

183
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:57,058
Rym: I forget their names, even though I just looked it up.

184
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,520
Rym: But basically, they are pretty much perfection when it comes to Super Mario Bros.

185
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,425
Rym: 1.

186
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,779
Scott: I can do just as good as they did.

187
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:06,090
Rym: One is just as well.

188
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,637
Rym: Yeah.

189
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,506
Scott: I know.

190
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:08,359
Rym: Captain Grammar.

191
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,608
Scott: Captain Sleep.

192
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:10,420
Rym: Yeah.

193
00:14:12,522 --> 00:14:12,704
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:14,620
Scott: Speaking of Captain Grammar, how not to suck.

195
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,459
Scott: It's supposed to be how to not suck.

196
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:17,002
Scott: Yeah.

197
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:21,000
Rym: I point out that I put how to not suck in everything we do about this whole thing.

198
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,260
Scott: But you say how not to suck.

199
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:23,288
Rym: Well, you do.

200
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:24,099
Scott: You also do.

201
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:24,566
Scott: No.

202
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:25,019
Scott: Yeah.

203
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,280
Scott: I'm sure we have a recording of it, in fact.

204
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,640
Rym: I think that I've said it the correct way more times than I've said it the incorrect way.

205
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,193
Scott: That doesn't mean shit.

206
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:32,779
Rym: Yeah, it does.

207
00:14:33,346 --> 00:14:33,491
Rym: Anyway.

208
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:33,800
Rym: Anyway.

209
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:40,842
Rym: So these guys, they set up two TVs and they had original NESs, like no emulators or anything.

210
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:44,500
Rym: And they raced each other to see who could beat Mario 1 first.

211
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:45,846
Rym: I could beat them.

212
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:47,597
Rym: Now, aside from the fact that no, you can't.

213
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,501
Rym: Yeah, I could.

214
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:57,180
Rym: Aside from the fact that they beat the game crazily fast without ever dying or anything, they beat the game within seconds of each other.

215
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,480
Scott: Like one was it like within milliseconds, like me, like the flag at the same time.

216
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:02,721
Rym: Yeah.

217
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:09,118
Rym: One guy's record, his all time record is like five minutes and 11 seconds and the other guy's like five minutes and nine seconds.

218
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,882
Rym: Ooh.

219
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:19,840
Rym: Like the race was neck in neck the whole time and one would pull away a little bit because one of them wouldn't attempt something difficult, but then the other one would jump ahead and watch this video.

220
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,599
Rym: It's amazing.

221
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:28,060
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I've seen Mario 1 speed runs, but those are always like programmed with some emulator or something.

222
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,140
Rym: This was two guys doing it live.

223
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,919
Scott: There's two guys doing it with their hands.

224
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,442
Scott: Right.

225
00:15:32,944 --> 00:15:41,443
Rym: And they don't do anything particularly impressive, you know, because they play just I'll know that the jump and this is even mentioned in the Google video, like side notes from the website.

226
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:50,101
Rym: But in World 8-2, one guy jumps straight through all these bad guys and the other guy sits there and ducks for like three seconds until the coast is clear.

227
00:15:50,643 --> 00:16:01,012
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's not you know, it's a pretty good move, but it's not like one of the crazy things like in the Mario 2 speed run where he jumps over without using the magic carpet.

228
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:01,379
Scott: Yeah.

229
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:16,899
Scott: Anyway, so I don't know who here is super old school like me, but before there were Game Boys and before everyone had Game Boys and such, there were other games that you could video games you could play in your car on long trips.

230
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:18,340
Rym: Yeah, back in the Stone Age.

231
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,300
Rym: And these things are terrible.

232
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,679
Rym: I don't know why Scott seems so enamored with them.

233
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,339
Scott: Hey, the Game & Watch was like the original real deal, right?

234
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:39,800
Scott: But then a company called Tiger LCD or Tiger Electronics, whatever, they made these little LCD games that would all take two AA batteries, most of them anyway, and it was like this fun little LCD video game.

235
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,900
Scott: And there's a website here that has pictures of most of them.

236
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,300
Scott: I say most because at first I thought they didn't have any missing.

237
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:51,320
Scott: But in fact, there is one that I had that is not on this site.

238
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:53,358
Rym: So which one?

239
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,078
Scott: Outrun.

240
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:05,000
Scott: Well, actually, Outrun is on this site, but the Outrun they show is actually like this whole big piece of plastic that's the front of a car with a real steering wheel on it.

241
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,699
Scott: Like, look at this thing.

242
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:07,300
Scott: You know, it's kind of crazy.

243
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:11,440
Scott: Ah, the Outrun that I had was just like all the other ones.

244
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,420
Scott: That was just a little white thing with buttons on the left and buttons on the right.

245
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:25,659
Scott: And, you know, but anyway, some of the best ones actually were the Disney ones, like the Disney ones were like bigger and they had more plastic and they cost a little more.

246
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,680
Scott: But like the Aladdin one was like this terrific game.

247
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:42,640
Scott: Like you could call on the carpet, you could call on the genie three times to come help you and you would throw your swords at Jafar and stuff and you'd like jump and duck and get around the magic carpet and stuff.

248
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:47,466
Rym: I'm sorry, I found these games just utterly, I don't know, I guess contemptible is the word.

249
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:49,020
Rym: I just couldn't stand them.

250
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,238
Rym: They weren't really good games.

251
00:17:50,862 --> 00:18:03,800
Scott: Well, they leave a lot to the imagination because, you know, all you really have is, you know, it's like there's a screen and there are only so many built-in LCD sprites on the screen and some of them are out of your control and some of them are under your control.

252
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:15,860
Rym: And you're basically trying to control your LCD sprites that, you know, you can-- Imagine playing a game that goes one frame per second and there are only like three possible frames for your character ever.

253
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:19,040
Rym: Yeah, and-- Yeah, that sounds just awesome.

254
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,620
Scott: You can also control like weapons and things.

255
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
Scott: It depends on the game.

256
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:31,618
Scott: Like some of the games are more complicated than others, like the Street Fighter game, you know, you could go forward, back, up, down, punch, kick, punch left, punch right, use your special move.

257
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,370
Scott: It was, you know, it was better than any Street Fighter for the NES because, you know, there wasn't one.

258
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:40,540
Scott: Except for Street Fighter 2010.

259
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:46,760
Rym: I mean, I hate to, you know, rain all over your thing of the day, but I'd rather play with, I don't know, nothing than a tiger game back when I was a kid.

260
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,600
Scott: Well, see the thing was tiger games weren't something you really did like in your house.

261
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,080
Scott: You did like on a trip when there was no Game Boys.

262
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:56,759
Scott: As soon as Game Boys came around, these things were done.

263
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:07,420
Rym: Actually, I point out that when the Game Boy came out, some people got Game Boys, but there were a lot of people, at least in my school, who kept playing the tiger games and insisted they were better.

264
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,339
Scott: Alright, those people are messed up.

265
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,560
Scott: There's no way-- None of these tiger games even come close to Tetris.

266
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:35,078
Scott: It's not even like-- Okay, maybe Home Alone 2 is probably the best one because the way that worked is like you'd go up and down escalators and there was a map and it would show you where you were on the map and you could run all around the mall setting traps and it would show you where the bad guys were on the map and you would try to trap them.

267
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:38,360
Scott: and once you trapped them enough times, it was actually pretty good and complex.

268
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,260
Rym: I think the NES one was the same kind of way.

269
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,420
Scott: Yeah, the NES one was also really good.

270
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,279
Scott: I should go find that ROM.

271
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,820
Scott: But other than that one, I think none of these hold up to anything the Game Boy had at all.

272
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:58,476
Rym: Yeah, I guess before the Game Boy came out, as a little kid, I'd either read or sleep in the car and tiger games were just kind of-- I remember laughing at my friends who had them.

273
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:05,239
Scott: No, we've always-- whenever we went on a long trip, our mom would buy some tiger games and that would keep us quiet for most of the trip.

274
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,700
Rym: So in keeping with our first fairly weak-themed week, how to not suck at games and gaming.

275
00:20:12,923 --> 00:20:14,139
Scott: Oh, we said it grammatically correct.

276
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,276
Rym: Correctly.

277
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,004
Scott: Haha!

278
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,660
Scott: It's funny.

279
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,680
Rym: Yeah, you may notice that we will probably be saying "haha" fairly often for the next, I don't know, month.

280
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:24,960
Scott: All right, so anyway.

281
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:26,159
Rym: I'm sorry about that.

282
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,320
Rym: The first rule-- A new inside joke has really gotten to us lately.

283
00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:29,772
Rym: Yeah.

284
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,720
Scott: The first rule about being good at games, try to win.

285
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,619
Rym: Now, this might seem obvious.

286
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:40,705
Rym: I mean, you might think, "All right, if I'm playing a game with people, my goal is to win.

287
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:42,270
Rym: Have a good time and

288
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:42,452
Rym: win.".

289
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:46,120
Rym: If you're not playing to win, you might as well not even play the game.

290
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I can't tell you how many times people are like, you know, you play a game to win and some other people don't play to win.

291
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,720
Scott: They just play to manipulate the pieces.

292
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,959
Scott: I don't know what they're doing there.

293
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:04,219
Scott: But if not everyone in the game is trying to win, it really ruins the game for the people who are.

294
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:15,218
Rym: Like, a good example of it, way back, we were freshmen at RIT and our friend Greg, we were playing a four-way game of Settlers, and it was me and Scott and our friend Greg and this girl we knew named Yoen, I think.

295
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,696
Scott: I don't remember at all.

296
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,580
Rym: It was once some girl we knew.

297
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:20,020
Rym: It might have been a five-way game or a six-way game.

298
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,360
Rym: I forget.

299
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,200
Rym: All I remember is that we were playing Settlers, and Greg was in last place.

300
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,740
Rym: He just happened to be, because he's pretty good at the game.

301
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,477
Rym: He was in last place.

302
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:36,980
Rym: Instead of just striving to do his best or whatever, he just kind of started giving all his stuff to the girl, and then she won because of that, and the game just kind of ended.

303
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:39,579
Scott: Imagine if you were playing baseball, right?

304
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:50,100
Scott: And you're not major leagues, there's no prize or anything, so no one really cares, and your team really wants to win, and you're trying your best, and the other team just doesn't care.

305
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:54,480
Scott: The pitcher lobs the ball to you, and no one even bothers to field.

306
00:21:55,801 --> 00:22:01,499
Scott: If no one's bothering to field the ball, you're not in this heated race to run around and get home.

307
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,220
Scott: You're just like, "Oh, they're not even trying.

308
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,696
Scott: Now it's not even fun to run the bases because no one's trying to get

309
00:22:05,717 --> 00:22:05,757
Scott: me.".

310
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:11,000
Rym: Now, of course, it really all depends on what, I guess to use a game theory term, utility you want from the game.

311
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:17,960
Rym: I mean, if you're playing with three people, and all of you just want to screw around or just want to have fun, and you don't care who wins, great.

312
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,960
Scott: Just fiddle around with the pieces.

313
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,999
Scott: Don't even bother with the rules.

314
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,460
Rym: Or even just play the game, but do whatever you want.

315
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,300
Rym: The thing is, the problem only comes up when multiple people in a game want a different utility from the game.

316
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,738
Rym: So if I'm playing to win, and you're just playing to fiddle around with the pieces, then it's not going to be fun for either of us.

317
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:45,920
Scott: My suggestion, though, is that if you're the type of person who doesn't want to play games to win, then you should probably play different kinds of games, like Apples to Apples or Nanofictionaries.

318
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,720
Rym: Or Wench, which we played this weekend.

319
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,618
Rym: It was actually really fun.

320
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:49,780
Scott: Or Mafia.

321
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:58,100
Scott: Or games where winning really isn't the point, where the point is the game is crazy, as opposed to games like Puerto Rico or Tigris and Euphrates, where the point is winning.

322
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,400
Rym: Because we've actually had good success with that.

323
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,600
Rym: I mean, Scott and I, and the rest of most of our crew, are fairly hardcore German gamers.

324
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,578
Rym: Like we'll sit down and play a multiple hour game where we move cubes around and yell at each other.

325
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:11,100
Rym: And we really play to win, like seriously.

326
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:13,759
Rym: But some of our friends just really aren't into that.

327
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,939
Rym: And at least we can still play games with them, because we play a lot of these more open-ended games, like as Scott said, Apples to Apples, and et cetera.

328
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:36,279
Scott: Now the second rule of not sucking at games is don't cooperate with the guy who's winning, and don't, you know, I guess you can screw anyone, but you want to try to screw the person who's ahead of you.

329
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,640
Rym: Yeah, like say you're playing a game with five people, and you're currently winning.

330
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,860
Rym: Now say the person in last place is losing, like they're losing by a lot.

331
00:23:45,581 --> 00:23:52,860
Rym: And instead of trying to win themselves, or trying to, you know, not be in last place, say they just start taking every action to prevent you from winning.

332
00:23:53,581 --> 00:24:00,040
Rym: So you would have won, and the only reason you lose is because the person who was in last place had nothing better to do, so they just screwed you out of the victory.

333
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:01,898
Rym: That's not really cool.

334
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,418
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of like, you know, a spoiler.

335
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,800
Scott: Like it's like imagine if you're in a car race, and you're winning the car race.

336
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,060
Scott: You're winning it so much, you're passing the guy who's in last place.

337
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,758
Scott: And then, since he can't win, he crashes into you.

338
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:19,297
Scott: That's what it's like.

339
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:20,538
Scott: Don't do that.

340
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:20,851
Rym: Yeah.

341
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:43,079
Rym: Now honestly, it's not a problem for us, because basically, if I'm not going to win a game, like, actually it happened to me in, uh, we played Citadel's over the weekend, and I would have had a decent chance of winning, but after a few rounds into the game, Evan to my left decided to be the king every round, and he decided to assassinate the, uh, king every round.

342
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:46,080
Rym: That may sound weird, but it actually makes sense if you play the game.

343
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,197
Rym: Basically, he set up the game so that I could not in any conceivable way win.

344
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:54,660
Rym: And there was no way I could win at this point.

345
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:56,157
Rym: But the game still had a long way to go.

346
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,320
Rym: Now, regardless of how well that strategy worked for him, I didn't just turn around and start trying to screw whoever I could in the game.

347
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:06,280
Rym: I did everything I could to not end up in last place.

348
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,420
Rym: So my utility became strive to win, but more importantly, strive to not be in last place.

349
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:17,139
Rym: That way I'm still participating in the game, I'm still having fun, but I'm not just spoiling the game for other people.

350
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:25,720
Scott: And of course, you know, he's not, you don't want to modify the outcome of the game to not match the play that occurred.

351
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,100
Scott: You know, 'cause some, it really, sometimes it's a broken game that lets these things happen.

352
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:32,774
Scott: You know?

353
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:43,585
Scott: Like, the simple fact that someone who's not doing well can ruin the game, and there's no way that they can win at some point before the end, that's like, you know, it shouldn't be.

354
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:55,534
Scott: In a perfectly designed game, there should be no point during the game before the end of the game where you can have absolutely no chance of winning, no matter what your score is.

355
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,458
Scott: Or else it's, I don't know.

356
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,820
Rym: That can happen if you make poor decisions in a good game.

357
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,580
Scott: But the point is, you don't want a game, if a game keeps making the game, god, I need some grammar.

358
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:11,040
Rym: Alright, alright.

359
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:11,559
Scott: Okay.

360
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:26,198
Scott: If there is a game in which people who play poorly frequently end up in a situation where they cannot win well before the game is actually over, that game probably isn't the best game in the world.

361
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:35,119
Rym: Yeah, um, Risk is a big purveyor of this, um, Settlers kinda gets to that point when you play with good players, but that becomes more random.

362
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,439
Scott: Monopoly, I guess, kinda.

363
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,459
Scott: Oh, Monopoly, definitely.

364
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,176
Scott: Yeah.

365
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:45,676
Rym: Axis and Allies, Shogun, that game we talked about, someone will win long before someone wins.

366
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,840
Scott: Uh, even in, like, chess, it's like, I have a million pieces and you have two, but now it'll take, like, 20 turns for me to actually get Checkmate, you know?

367
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,866
Rym: Yeah, well that doesn't happen.

368
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,796
Rym: if your two good people are playing chess, that happens when we play chess.

369
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,720
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but you see the point, like, in checkers, one guy's a bunch of kings and then you're running around trying to get the other guy.

370
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,060
Rym: Yeah, but again, that's a two player game, I think that's a whole different thing.

371
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,077
Scott: Yeah, a two player game is a whole different thing, I'm just trying to think of examples, but.

372
00:27:11,242 --> 00:27:12,199
Rym: I think we had enough examples.

373
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:13,060
Scott: Okay, cool.

374
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,600
Rym: Yeah, once again, we're tired.

375
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:18,159
Scott: Don't fall asleep during games.

376
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,240
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

377
00:27:19,341 --> 00:27:19,980
Scott: Oh, okay, ready?

378
00:27:20,761 --> 00:27:26,040
Scott: There is the third way to not suck at games, pay attention and take your turn.

379
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:36,660
Rym: Yeah, now this is a pet peeve of ours, your mileage may vary, but honestly, we don't like it if people take more than about 20 seconds to take their turn in most games.

380
00:27:37,162 --> 00:27:45,859
Scott: I mean, most board games don't have simultaneous play, you know, when one person's taking their turn, everyone else is sitting around waiting for them to take their turn.

381
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:56,952
Scott: And, you know, if you spend, like, five minutes taking your turn, everyone else is spending five minutes doing absolutely nothing, it's, you know, it makes the game un-fun for everyone else.

382
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,380
Rym: So you have to kinda, you know, move along a little.

383
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,619
Scott: Yeah, and you might say, "Oh, that contradicts rule number one, try to

384
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:03,800
Scott: win.".

385
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:04,439
Scott: Well, guess what?

386
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:08,019
Scott: If you can't think fast enough, you probably don't deserve to win.

387
00:28:09,362 --> 00:28:12,920
Scott: You know, it's about thinking correctly, but also thinking quickly.

388
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,540
Scott: Any idiot can figure it out if they spend ten minutes.

389
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:20,164
Rym: See, I guess that's another hallmark of a game that maybe isn't the most well-designed game.

390
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,800
Rym: Like, the game Acquire.

391
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:29,599
Rym: It's a fun game, a little stock market kinda deal, but if you sit and calculate the odds of everything every round, you're guaranteed to win.

392
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:34,536
Rym: And if everyone calculates it every round, the game becomes just a machine, and you might as well not even play it.

393
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:41,860
Rym: So we had a friend who would actually sit there and think every round, you know, five minutes, and come up with the exact perfect move.

394
00:28:42,561 --> 00:28:47,380
Rym: And no one else wanted to bother with that monumental kind of wasted effort.

395
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,520
Rym: I mean, if everyone did that, then it wouldn't matter anymore, and the field would be level.

396
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,728
Rym: The only way to really fix that was to say, "Alright, you can only take thirty seconds on your

397
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:55,933
Rym: turn.".

398
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:59,440
Rym: Now the game goes to whoever can think all of that the most quickly.

399
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:00,099
Rym: Mhm.

400
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,839
Scott: Another thing is, when it's someone else's turn, 'cause people's turns do take time, you know?

401
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:08,140
Scott: At the most, someone's turn takes a minute, depending on the game.

402
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,239
Scott: You know, maybe it's a game where they have to manipulate a lot of pieces, and that takes a while during their turn, you know?

403
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:17,880
Scott: Think about what you're gonna do on your turn during the other person's turn.

404
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,140
Scott: Also, some games might allow you to prepare physical stuff for your turn.

405
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,260
Scott: Like I know in Illuminati, you can prepare your income before it gets to your turn.

406
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:27,708
Rym: Yep.

407
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:39,519
Scott: Do that, because it makes the game go faster, and when the game goes faster, it makes it more fun for everyone, and it actually helps you win, because, well, you're thinking about what you're gonna do constantly.

408
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:46,579
Scott: Even in some games where, you know, you can't really think about what you're gonna do before it's your turn, because- Like Alabra.

409
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,092
Scott: Oh my.

410
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:47,920
Scott: Yeah.

411
00:29:48,320 --> 00:30:01,220
Scott: Or like Ticket to Ride, kind of, where the situation changes so much between your turn and your next turn, that thinking about it along the way, you know, just doesn't help you because the situation will be different before your turn comes around.

412
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:09,620
Scott: Just think about whatever you can, because there usually is something you can think about, you know, and then your turn will take less time and everyone will be happier.

413
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:25,460
Rym: Now also, if a bunch of friends decide they're gonna play a game, and you decide to play with them, you've gotta commit to playing the game to the end, because otherwise, nothing is more disappointing than if three people are really into a game or sitting around playing it, and then the fourth player halfway through just doesn't want to play anymore.

414
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,479
Scott: Oh, that's the worst.

415
00:30:26,842 --> 00:30:27,239
Rym: Oh my god.

416
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,340
Rym: Because you can't keep going.

417
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,640
Rym: If they don't take their turn, or they just leave, you can't continue.

418
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,080
Rym: That basically just- the game's over and no one wins.

419
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:34,529
Rym: Yeah.

420
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,840
Scott: If you play a game, you better pay attention to that game.

421
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,340
Scott: Don't like, go looking at something else all the time.

422
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:57,631
Scott: I'm guilty of this sometimes, like, there'll be a distracting movie in the room and it'll grab me, you know, or the worst is when something happens in the middle of a game and everyone in the game gets up to go do something else, the game sits there, then everyone comes back and there's this game sitting there- And no

423
00:30:57,711 --> 00:30:58,759
Rym: one remembers what was going

424
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,300
Scott: on in No one remembers what was going on, no one remembers whose turn it was.

425
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,220
Rym: When you- the best way to- It's fine if everyone gets distracted, because then no one cared in the first place.

426
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:12,440
Scott: It's only a problem when- Well yeah, but then it's kind of disappointing for everyone when they come back and the game is lost, you know, kind of-.

427
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:20,540
Rym: Yeah, well I mean it depends on the game and what you're doing, like if you were just playing a game to kill time until the pizza arrived, and then you ate as soon as the pizza came and then you forgot what was going on in the game, whatever.

428
00:31:20,982 --> 00:31:25,979
Rym: But basically just don't be the one guy who ruins the game for everyone else by quitting halfway through.

429
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,140
Scott: Oh, oh yeah.

430
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,159
Scott: Do not cheat.

431
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:35,500
Rym: Alright, yeah, you wouldn't think we had to say this, and- because honestly, none of us- other than Scott, none of us have ever cheated at a board game.

432
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,539
Scott: I didn't cheat.

433
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:41,219
Scott: Well, not quite, I mean it wasn't against the rules in the book.

434
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,819
Rym: Alright, I submit that it was at least morally dubious.

435
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:52,740
Rym: I agree it was dubious, which is why- It's like a CEO, you know, giving him a pay raise and then firing a bunch of people.

436
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,960
Rym: It's not technically illegal, but you're such an ass if you do it.

437
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,460
Scott: Well, what happened is this game where you have a deck- where you have cards- Citadel.

438
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:09,848
Scott: You have cards and you pass them around, and there's one of each card, so you take one and you give the rest to the other player, and then they pick one, and they give the rest to the other player- And you

439
00:32:09,868 --> 00:32:12,419
Rym: have a vested interest in knowing what everyone picked.

440
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:13,159
Scott: Yes, you do.

441
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:38,479
Scott: If you know what everyone picked, you can really kick some ass, so what I did is I always thought that someone else might do it, and I was looking out for it, defensively, because I thought it was such an obvious move, but I wasn't going to do it because I was too honest, where what you would do is you would just take the card you want, put the cards in order, hand them to the next person, they would select it, and you would see which one they selected by memorizing the order in which the cards were.

442
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:47,259
Rym: So Scott does this, and he hands them to Pete, and Pete like fans the cards out, very obviously thinks selects one of them, puts it down, and then puts the cards out.

443
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:57,536
Scott: I believe that no one of you actually said anything before I admitted it, because Pete fanned the cards out, I was staring right at him, he drew- I just stare- I just store at him.

444
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:57,990
Rym: Store?

445
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:58,678
Rym: Store?

446
00:32:59,062 --> 00:32:59,479
Rym: Stared.

447
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,036
Rym: Stared.

448
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:03,100
Rym: Captain Grammar Strikes Again.

449
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,020
Scott: It's grammar day here on GeekNights.

450
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:23,678
Scott: I stared right at Pete, right at his hand, I saw exactly what he picked, he handed the cards to Rym, I announced loudly, very loudly, what card Pete had selected, then Rym selected a card, and I very loudly proclaimed what card Rym had selected, then at the end of the turn I told them that I did it, and they were like, "Goddamn you

451
00:33:23,698 --> 00:33:23,959
Scott: cheater!".

452
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,926
Rym: See that's the difference, to Scott's credit, I mean, he cheated, but it was more like a, "Hey guys, heads up,".

453
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:30,900
Rym: whoa, when he was open about it, we didn't care.

454
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:36,839
Scott: It was mostly a defense against anyone doing it in the future, because I was worried about people already doing it, specifically Rym.

455
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:50,739
Rym: Scott accuses me of cheating, even though I've never cheated in any game other than the cheating version of Illuminati, where you're supposed to cheat, and Euchre, because honestly for any of you who play Euchre, the card game, half of that game is how you cheat with your partner.

456
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,620
Scott: I accuse anyone of cheating and does better than me.

457
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,899
Rym: Yeah, Scott accused me of cheating at Advance Wars, so.

458
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,480
Scott: Doing better than me is equivalent to cheating.

459
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,016
Rym: Yeah.

460
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:10,860
Rym: But I mean, apparently, there are people out there who cheat, like, consider this, we've played games with our friends for years and years and years, and cheating, like, no one even considered the idea that any of us would ever cheat, like actually cheat at a game.

461
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,958
Rym: It was never even an idea, like, we never even conceived of it.

462
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:32,476
Rym: And then, recently, we were playing games with these, uh, Moz guys, this gaming group in the area, and we all sit down, and, uh, one of the guys' victory point chips were kinda near the victory point chip pool, and one of the other guys was like, "Hey, we should move that pool so there's no, uh, confusion as to how many points anyone

463
00:34:32,496 --> 00:34:32,757
Rym: has.".

464
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,060
Rym: And we look at each other like, "What?

465
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:36,010
Rym: Why bother?

466
00:34:36,862 --> 00:34:37,386
Rym: What's he gonna do,

467
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:37,730
Rym: cheat?".

468
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:42,000
Rym: But apparently, other gaming groups have problems with this occasionally.

469
00:34:42,522 --> 00:34:43,438
Rym: Or they worry about it.

470
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:54,100
Scott: Yeah, if you're the kind of person who, like, if you're gonna play a game, right, it's like, how can I explain this, there are emotions within the game and without the game.

471
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:02,339
Scott: If you're the kind of person who lets emotions within the game carry outside of the game, you probably shouldn't play games at all.

472
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:09,699
Scott: Not with anyone else, because what happens is, let's say we're playing, um, what's a game where you screw the other player a lot.

473
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,180
Rym: Alright, uh, Tigers and Euphrates with the catastrophes.

474
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,960
Scott: Yeah, Tigers and Euphrates with the catastrophes.

475
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,558
Scott: You can directly screw up other players by putting catastrophes right in good places to screw them.

476
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:25,319
Scott: So if you do this during a game, to me, I'll be like, "Fuck you!

477
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,405
Scott: Fuck

478
00:35:26,446 --> 00:35:26,629
Scott: you!".

479
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,618
Scott: But after the game's over, I won't be like, "I hate you for doing that still,

480
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:31,960
Scott: girl.".

481
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:37,400
Scott: And be serious about it, I mean, what the hell's your problem if you're like that?

482
00:35:38,343 --> 00:35:40,460
Scott: The game is not like, it's just a game, man.

483
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:53,080
Rym: Or by the same token, if in a game, like, say Scott, I don't know, dinged my car in the morning, so I'm mad at him, and then at night we're playing a board game, and I do everything I can to make sure he doesn't win just because I'm mad at him, what the hell.

484
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,800
Scott: Yeah, that's not cool, because, you know, Rym's not doing everything he can to win the game for himself, which is rule number one.

485
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,918
Scott: He's doing everything to make sure I lose, you know, that makes the game fun for not him and not me.

486
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:07,140
Rym: Yep, that was kind of a non-sequitur, since we're still talking about cheating, though.

487
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,260
Rym: Well, no, because cheating is something that the person-- Yeah, I see your point, now that I realize it's outside of the game.

488
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:28,945
Scott: A person who takes their emotions, you know, from outside and inside the game, across the border, is the kind of person who would cheat, because if you're gonna be mad about losing after the game's over, you know, then you're probably gonna be more likely to cheat, because that'll make you feel good.

489
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:37,959
Scott: after the game's over, you know, if you actually take the game too seriously and care about the winning and losing on another level, that's gonna be a cheater, which is not good.

490
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:38,836
Rym: Yep.

491
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:45,699
Scott: It's kind of like, imagine if you're playing football, like American football, and a guy tackles you and breaks your arm.

492
00:36:46,983 --> 00:36:48,020
Scott: It happens, man.

493
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:55,040
Scott: If you're the kind of person who, after the football game, and after you're out of the hospital, will go and beat that guy up and break his arm, you got a problem.

494
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:55,509
Rym: Yeah.

495
00:36:55,941 --> 00:36:57,180
Rym: Actually, something like that happened.

496
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:17,840
Rym: We were at a quiz bowl tournament in high school, and we were just playing tackle football outside with a bunch of other kids from other schools, and one guy knocked a tooth out during a tackle by accident, and he was hurt, but the guy who knocked it out and the guy who had it knocked out, they both walked over and called a doctor and took care of it, and they were walking like, "Ha, you totally knocked my tooth out.

497
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,013
Rym: Yeah, that

498
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:19,378
Rym: sucked.".

499
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:25,939
Scott: Yeah, see, that's how it's supposed to be, you know, unless, of course, the guy obviously meant it, like he tried to knock the guy's tooth out.

500
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,219
Rym: Yeah, like, say you have a scrum, and then one guy just kicks another guy who doesn't even have the ball in the sack.

501
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:34,020
Rym: That's a different story altogether.

502
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:41,340
Scott: Yeah, it's obvious, like, in ice hockey, if a guy hits you, he hits you, but if you start a hockey fight, that's a hockey fight.

503
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,419
Rym: Well, that's also part of the game.

504
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,200
Scott: It's more like- There are different kinds, there are some hockey fights for one reason.

505
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:53,679
Rym: If someone takes his skate off and tries to stab you with it, yeah, you can tell we're tired because I didn't put an away message up on aim, so I just got messaged.

506
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:54,333
Scott: Good job.

507
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:54,888
Rym: Yeah.

508
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,159
Scott: Yeah, but that's the idea.

509
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:06,180
Rym: But basically, I mean, my point on cheating is simply that if you have to worry about your friends cheating at a board game, uh, what kind of friends are those?

510
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:06,541
Rym: Those

511
00:38:06,561 --> 00:38:28,800
Scott: are the kind of friends who probably take the game too seriously, you know, I mean, you take the game- you can't take the game not seriously enough because if you don't care about the game at all, you're not putting any effort into winning, but at the same time you take it too seriously and you care about it too much, then winning and losing becomes like this life or death thing when really all it is is some number and some pieces moving around on a piece of cardboard.

512
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,119
Rym: I mean, I guess for me, I take games very seriously, but I take them seriously within the context of the game.

513
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:34,572
Scott: Yep.

514
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,807
Rym: So it is life or death during the game, and as soon as the game's over, it's "haha, you beat

515
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:39,993
Rym: me.".

516
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,056
Scott: Or "haha, I win, you all

517
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:42,339
Scott: suck.".

518
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:42,999
Scott: And that's it.

519
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,938
Scott: That's the last you'll hear of it.

520
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:49,340
Scott: Yeah, unless- Until the next time the game is played, in which case, "didn't I kick your asses last

521
00:38:49,423 --> 00:38:49,857
Scott: time?".

522
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:54,060
Rym: Yeah, but you know what, that falls into the realm of trash talk, which is not only acceptable, but expected.

523
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:57,160
Scott: Uh, uh, encouraged is the correct word you're looking for.

524
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:04,457
Rym: I mean, once again, your mileage may vary, but trash talk is a very critical part of the front row crew culture here.

525
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,439
Rym: I mean, if someone loses a board game badly enough, they'll hear about it for the next, I don't know, the rest of their life.

526
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,207
Scott: Yeah.

527
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,796
Scott: I mean, if you can't take and dish out trash talk, I think, you know, you probably shouldn't do it then.

528
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:28,992
Scott: But at the same time, if you can't take it, you're probably missing out on a lot of the enjoyment that can be had from dishing and taking trash talk when all are capable of doing so.

529
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:34,040
Rym: Alright, now the last one is very important if you play, uh, German-type board games.

530
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,900
Rym: And this one is gonna sound very self-deprecating because we have a problem with a certain game.

531
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,900
Rym: So uh, read the rules and play the game right.

532
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:43,736
Scott: Yeah.

533
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:50,040
Scott: A lot of people like to modify rules of games, and- Which is alright, but make sure you understand what you're doing.

534
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:54,450
Scott: Yeah, a house rule is okay now and then, you know, especially if it's an intelligent house rule.

535
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,880
Scott: Some games, in fact, need house rules to be playable.

536
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,518
Rym: But like, say you're playing Monopoly, and you add the free parking rule where, you know, all the money goes in the middle and whoever lands on free parking gets it.

537
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,438
Rym: Uh, that's not a good house rule, that just ruins the game and makes it a random crap fest.

538
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,820
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you really have to think about whether you're making the game more fun or whether you're making the game silly.

539
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,820
Scott: The way game rules are written are by people who spent a lot of time designing and perfecting the rules of that game.

540
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:26,420
Scott: And if you play it the way that is indicated, you'll probably get the most fun, especially if you're, you know, taking it seriously and trying to win.

541
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:34,039
Rym: Now we say probably, because like, there's a game Enddecker, and most people seem to agree that a variant that some people kind of came up with is better than the actual game.

542
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:49,259
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there's an old Enddecker and a new Enddecker, and it's pretty complicated, but- Yeah, but- You know, in most cases, you want to play the game as written in the rules, and, you know, when you mess up the rules, you just put an asterisk next to the score at the end.

543
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,220
Rym: Yeah, like in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

544
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:58,540
Scott: And everyone goes, "Ambiguity, ambiguity," and then, you know, you finish the game out following the rules as best you can.

545
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,940
Rym: Yeah, but the main thing is, don't feel bad if you screw up the rules, because, I mean, we're the hardest core German gamers out there.

546
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,499
Rym: Like, we scare some of the scary war gamers when we play with them.

547
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:13,479
Rym: But the first times we played Puerto Rico, we played three player, but we didn't take the prospectors out.

548
00:41:13,882 --> 00:41:16,680
Rym: So, the game was just completely broken, and we didn't realize it right away.

549
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,860
Scott: Yeah, and we played Amun-Re, a game we like a lot and have played many times.

550
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,140
Rym: Yeah, like, it's one of our favorite games.

551
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,313
Scott: We played it incorrectly every single time, except maybe we got it right the first few times.

552
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,539
Rym: Nah, I don't think we did.

553
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:32,360
Scott: I think we had, like, rules right the first few times, and then we forgot them.

554
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:32,879
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

555
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:39,180
Scott: I don't think we had all of them right, because I don't think- I don't- I can't remember a specific instance in which we had every rule correct and we played the game.

556
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,857
Rym: Basically, we loved this game, and then one day someone noticed that we were doing a rule wrong.

557
00:41:43,382 --> 00:41:45,200
Scott: And then we noticed we were doing another rule wrong.

558
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,760
Rym: And then we looked through the rules, like, with a fine-tooth comb, and we figured out, like, everything, and we found, like, another thing we were doing wrong.

559
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,820
Rym: We're like, alright, now we've got the game set, phew, now we're playing the game perfectly.

560
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,060
Scott: And then I found a website where you can play Amun-Re online.

561
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:00,240
Rym: And what did Scott discover?

562
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,599
Rym: We were still playing it wrong.

563
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,860
Scott: I was playing the game, and there was something that didn't quite match up with what I remembered from playing the board game.

564
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,498
Scott: So I went, and I, you know, I tried to call home, but Rym lost his cellphone, which he just got back today.

565
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,720
Rym: Yep, I say I had to mail the cool guy who, uh, found my cellphone some money.

566
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:26,020
Scott: So when I got home, I posed a question to everyone sitting there, three of which were Amun-Re players, and they all gave the answer that I would have given that morning.

567
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,757
Rym: Yeah, and I said, "Bullshit, we've got this game

568
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:29,079
Rym: down!".

569
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:30,493
Scott: And I said, "Read the

570
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:30,999
Scott: rulebook.".

571
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:34,438
Scott: And what was the first word out of "He who readeth the rulebook's

572
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:34,720
Scott: mouth?"?

573
00:42:34,841 --> 00:42:36,433
Rym: I believe the word was "Fuck

574
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:36,756
Rym: me!".

575
00:42:37,524 --> 00:42:38,459
Scott: That would be correct.

576
00:42:40,382 --> 00:42:42,840
Scott: So read the rules carefully and follow them.

577
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,531
Rym: A lesson we have learned.

578
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:44,040
Rym: well.

579
00:42:44,681 --> 00:42:46,460
Scott: A lesson learned, damage done.

580
00:42:47,045 --> 00:42:47,131
Rym: Yes.

581
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,600
Rym: Alright, so we're about done today.

582
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,879
Rym: I'm sorry we were tired.

583
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,239
Rym: Um, Pierrot has his dead Pierrot days.

584
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,000
Rym: Penny Arcade never makes a mistake, but, whatever.

585
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,520
Scott: Penny Arcade only has three days a week.

586
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,158
Scott: If we did three days a week, we could do it too.

587
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:00,614
Scott: Yeah.

588
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,940
Scott: We're just as good as they are.

589
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:02,759
Scott: In fact, better.

590
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,318
Scott: One more.

591
00:43:03,805 --> 00:43:04,139
Rym: One more?

592
00:43:04,304 --> 00:43:04,579
Rym: One more.

593
00:43:04,845 --> 00:43:05,500
Rym: Yes, he's better.

594
00:43:06,761 --> 00:43:07,460
Rym: Alright, yeah.

595
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:15,900
Rym: Uh, tomorrow I can guarantee that we'll be much more awake because I'm going to go to sleep about ten minutes after I stop talking into this microphone.

596
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:17,059
Scott: Awesome.

597
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:26,560
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

598
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,220
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

606
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,920
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
