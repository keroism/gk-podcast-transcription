1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,508
Scott: It's Wednesday, October 15th.

2
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:12,231
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:12,973
Scott: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:14,739
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,442
Scott: Tonight, Politics in Manga.

6
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:26,952
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,077 --> 00:00:36,088
Scott: So if there's one thing that is a never-ending source of opening bits, it is the choo-choo train.

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:36,650
Rym: Oh?

9
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:37,875
Scott: Oh yes indeed.

10
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:38,939
Scott: I got on the train today.

11
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,526
Scott: A little earlier train than usual.

12
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:44,063
Scott: You know, the Super Express basically stops at our stop and nowhere else.

13
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:46,412
Scott: Well, it makes up after our stop, but whatever.

14
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:50,446
Scott: I got on, you know, a car and it was a hot car.

15
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:59,846
Scott: So I walked from one end of the hot car to the other and I sort of thought about maybe sitting at the other end of the hot car, but there was a bathroom at the other end of the hot car.

16
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:02,699
Rym: A hot car plus bathroom equals bad idea.

17
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:03,763
Scott: So I did not sit there.

18
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,112
Scott: I sat in the next car, right?

19
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:06,875
Scott: It was basically...

20
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:08,984
Rym: Wait, how could the car have been that hot?

21
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:10,310
Rym: It wasn't that hot outside.

22
00:01:10,873 --> 00:01:11,777
Scott: It was a hot car.

23
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:12,460
Scott: I don't know.

24
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:17,087
Scott: I walked in and I was sweating my balls off and apparently everyone else was too because no one was sitting in that car.

25
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:17,992
Rym: Maybe the heat was on.

26
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:18,695
Scott: Maybe.

27
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:21,371
Rym: Maybe everyone's eye in that bathroom like a ticking time bomb.

28
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:23,261
Rym: Someone's going to open that door and people are going to die.

29
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:25,369
Scott: So I sat in the next car.

30
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:30,745
Scott: So between me and that nasty bathroom in the hot car was two vestibules.

31
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:32,149
Scott: basically, right?

32
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:34,154
Rym: Did something breach the vestibules?

33
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:35,818
Scott: Nothing breached.

34
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,306
Scott: Well, both vestibules.

35
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:39,874
Rym: There was a hull breach, I imagine.

36
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:41,180
Scott: There was indeed a hull breach.

37
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:44,369
Scott: You see, we were approaching Beacon Station.

38
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:45,312
Rym: Oh my God.

39
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:50,673
Scott: And I went to go wait in the vestibule, the vestibule of my car, not the vestibule of the other car.

40
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:52,160
Rym: But connected to that one.

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,559
Scott: Indeed, they were connected as train cars are connected with the big metal links.

42
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:59,650
Rym: If this was a space movie, you are in the airlock.

43
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:04,807
Rym: The cold death of space is outside, aka the hot car, possibly the aliens and lasers.

44
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:06,593
Scott: Yeah.

45
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:12,371
Scott: But when I got off the train or when I got really close to Beacon, it was pretty much just a flood.

46
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:17,168
Scott: It was just, it was just a straight up flood of water coming out of that bathroom.

47
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:27,526
Scott: And when the train, like when the train came in to stop, it was literally like a, like the sheet of like water just sort of came out into the vestibule and run.

48
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:30,517
Scott: And you know, it didn't come across the vestibules.

49
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,128
Rym: So you had that fire break between the car.

50
00:02:33,148 --> 00:02:33,549
Scott: Exactly.

51
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,971
Scott: It was just the sheet of water just came straight across and then down under the train.

52
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:48,267
Scott: Now you realize what this means because I've been in hot cars and half of the other car, you know, half of the car with the bathroom in it was just flooded with water like a centimeter deep.

53
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:52,120
Rym: Now, now see, I can see having the hot car that happened.

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:01,147
Rym: Surprisingly, the water looked clean, but at the same time, well, for it not to have been clean, someone had a real bad day.

55
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:01,709
Rym: Yeah.

56
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:04,139
Scott: I think it was just clogged and then filled up too.

57
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:05,824
Rym: Wait, but hot car is one thing.

58
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:07,810
Rym: Clogged bathroom is another thing.

59
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:14,410
Rym: Using the bathroom in the hot car has never in the history of hot car has been a good idea.

60
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,252
Rym: No bad idea.

61
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:16,878
Rym: Hold it in, seriously.

62
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:20,211
Rym: Go in the vestibule or something, but don't go in the hot car.

63
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,485
Rym: I imagine that was an Aaron Nardi situation right there.

64
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:30,229
Scott: It was, it was pretty funny just seeing this flood of water at the edge of the train, spilling out under the door.

65
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:31,453
Rym: Now here's the question.

66
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:34,182
Rym: Was anyone caught in the impact?

67
00:03:34,504 --> 00:03:40,689
Scott: Well, there, you know, there was some people, was there the guy that the shell of burger going, ah, they weren't himself.

68
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:50,871
Scott: Well, there was no one holding themselves up, but there were, when the train came in for a stop, there were people who were waiting in that vestibule and they didn't seem to mind standing in this water.

69
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:57,358
Rym: I guess it didn't, you know, I would have been holding myself up by the rails and leaping out of the car without touching it.

70
00:03:57,398 --> 00:04:01,498
Scott: The water looked clean and it didn't look like it was, you know, going above the sole of the shoe.

71
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:02,221
Scott: It wasn't that deep.

72
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:04,030
Scott: So I guess they just didn't mind.

73
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,256
Scott: And then they got off the train.

74
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:15,478
Rym: I guess if I was on a train car and suddenly the water came, all right, I could live with that, but the water out of the hot car, I don't know, the hot car bathroom, hot car bathroom, hot car bathroom, water flood.

75
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,584
Rym: Uh, Scott, I, there's a quest of you.

76
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:19,672
Rym: There's something that I can't believe hasn't come up yet.

77
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,604
Scott: Ah, it's in my raccoon wounds.

78
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,231
Scott: Yeah.

79
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:26,853
Rym: All right.

80
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:28,196
Scott: So that was pretty funny.

81
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:31,308
Scott: I'm always laughing at things like that, like infinitely flushing toilets.

82
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:32,854
Scott: So this is funnier than that.

83
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:39,823
Rym: Even, you know, you may laugh you out there, not Scott, but if Scott sees an infinitely flushing toilet, he just starts cracking up.

84
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:46,408
Scott: It doesn't help that the one that the bathroom at work has a pro a toilet that frequently as infinite flushes.

85
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:47,633
Scott: All right.

86
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:53,336
Rym: So before we go any further, we should point out that this isn't like a quote unquote special episode of GeekNights.

87
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:59,435
Rym: Those are mostly the way the dodo, but this is a somewhat unique episode of GeekNights yet.

88
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:04,954
Scott: We don't do these things too often or hardly ever at all, but, uh, basically here's the deal, right?

89
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:09,209
Scott: People are listeners want us to talk politics, but I don't want to.

90
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,574
Scott: Rym does, but I don't want it.

91
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:12,562
Rym: I like to talk about some politics.

92
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:14,891
Scott: Uh, I like to talk about comics.

93
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:16,336
Scott: Comics are cool, right?

94
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:24,402
Rym: We don't do enough episodes about comics, but luckily, well, we were this week going to talk about, uh, a famous comic Scrooge McDuck.

95
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:25,566
Scott: We're going to do that next time.

96
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:25,908
Scott: Yeah.

97
00:05:25,948 --> 00:05:27,433
Rym: But we had to put it off because of this.

98
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:27,915
Scott: Yep.

99
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,553
Scott: So, uh, came along this opportunity to sort of do an episode.

100
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,158
Scott: that sort of politics sort of not.

101
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,546
Scott: And I said, okay, let's do this thing.

102
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:38,249
Scott: Why the hell not?

103
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:54,886
Scott: So what's going on is a whole bunch of comic podcasts, podcasts about comic books of various sorts have sort of teamed up for the month of October, you know, leading into the big election in the U S and early November to do a comics politics month.

104
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:55,708
Scott: Right?

105
00:05:55,769 --> 00:06:04,491
Scott: So the idea is that all these podcasts in the month of October, we'll do an episode about politics and comics combined in some way.

106
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:13,480
Rym: And I said, you know, I just, I can't imagine there that many superhero comics that have anything non superficial to do with politics.

107
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:18,541
Scott: Well, if you want to find out, you know, plus, you know, not everyone's talking about superhero comics.

108
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:18,923
Rym: I know.

109
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:19,264
Rym: I know.

110
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:20,570
Rym: I'm just saying superhero comics.

111
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,879
Rym: I could talk about some V for Vendetta.

112
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,928
Rym: I think that's a very politically motivated coming.

113
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:25,129
Scott: Yeah.

114
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,053
Scott: That's a good one to go for.

115
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:31,396
Scott: Um, so basically if you want to maybe the silver surfer, no, not really.

116
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:41,373
Scott: If you want to listen to a bunch of podcasts about politics and comics, uh, I'll provide you with some links that, you know, it's sort of like a tag team thing, you know, the cross promotion dealing.

117
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:41,996
Rym: Wow.

118
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:44,485
Rym: We're, we haven't done this sort of thing in a long time.

119
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:46,973
Rym: Remember the days of promos?

120
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:47,675
Scott: Yeah.

121
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:48,337
Scott: Yeah.

122
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:48,939
Scott: Forget those.

123
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:52,190
Scott: Um, but yeah, I'll link it to the cross promotion dealies.

124
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:56,871
Scott: You'll see us up there probably as soon as I give them the link to this show after he put it up and such.

125
00:06:56,911 --> 00:07:14,421
Scott: And you know, if, if you're a, one of the people who's came here, not, you know, it was not a regular listener of our show, but as someone who listened to some other politic comic podcast and, you know, saw our link on this, one of these sites and came over, uh, just so you know, we're going to do news and things of the day.

126
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:18,681
Scott: And then we're going to talk about politics and manga, which is the topic that we have selected.

127
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:20,630
Rym: It's kind of our normal show format.

128
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:30,131
Scott: We've had some 600 episodes because, you know, the stuff that we're going to talk about politics and manga, we're basically going to be mostly focusing on a few politics, heavy manga series.

129
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,782
Scott: And our listeners have heard about those mostly already much.

130
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:42,211
Rym: anyone who saw, I don't know, the last four or five of our live appearances or anyone who's listened to the show for more than a year.

131
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,442
Rym: So it was probably heard everything we're about to say.

132
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:44,984
Rym: Yeah.

133
00:07:45,045 --> 00:08:00,388
Scott: So, you know, to make up for the fact that we're doing sort of redundant show for our older existing listeners, you know, and, but even though it's a new show for these sort of cross promotion listeners, we're going to do a normal show where we do news and all that other business and then politics and manga.

134
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:01,010
Scott: All right.

135
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,254
Scott: So that's enough of that.

136
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:04,722
Scott: Uh, let's go to the news.

137
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:05,244
Rym: All right.

138
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:06,028
Rym: All right.

139
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:07,072
Rym: So what do you got for me?

140
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,097
Scott: What do I have for you?

141
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:18,233
Rym: There's pretty much nothing on the, I mean, I guess anime news network is pretty much my AP wire of anime news and I don't really pay attention to comic news unless you tell me about something.

142
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:20,441
Rym: So I basically had nothing.

143
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:24,216
Scott: Well, if you want comics news, you can go to like news around or whatever.

144
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:24,979
Scott: Yeah.

145
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,350
Rym: If you want anime news is pretty much, uh, anime news network.

146
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:28,611
Scott: Yeah.

147
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:30,758
Scott: Um, so check this out.

148
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:32,323
Scott: This is sort of a video game news.

149
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:37,945
Scott: It came out of the Tokyo game show, but I think it's anime related enough to, to be said today, right?

150
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:47,573
Scott: Some people might not realize the studio Ghibli and level five are making a DS game, or it looks like to me, they've made a DS game.

151
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:49,980
Scott: Now there are two links for this.

152
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,954
Scott: One link is the trailer for this DS game video footage of the game.

153
00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:58,705
Scott: And let me tell you, this is pretty impressive shit right here.

154
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:08,864
Scott: We're talking, you know, a whole lot of video as is to be expected, you know, animated video, sort of like professor Layton, but obviously Ghibli animation, not professor Layton animation.

155
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:14,100
Scott: Uh, and also, you know, we got Ghibli style music going on.

156
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,382
Scott: It's like, you hear this music and you're like, Oh, that sounds like the music for every Ghibli movie ever.

157
00:09:18,522 --> 00:09:19,767
Scott: I could have told you right away.

158
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:22,619
Scott: Um, but yeah, the trailer is pretty impressive.

159
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,287
Scott: So that's one thing I'm linking to you for the news.

160
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:30,007
Scott: The other thing here, which is far more important than the trailer for this game, which, you know, of course you have to buy.

161
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:39,450
Scott: This is the, um, the, I don't know if it's exclusive or it's the default box the game comes in.

162
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:50,803
Scott: This is the most extravagant game box I've ever seen in my entire, the word ostentatious perhaps apply a double ostentatious, maybe, maybe epic.

163
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:53,109
Scott: It's like a spell.

164
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,656
Scott: First of all, this is spell book, right?

165
00:09:56,578 --> 00:10:03,967
Scott: And the spell book has on each page of the spell book is some sort of, you know, you know how Castlevania had the runes that you would draw with the stylus.

166
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:04,510
Rym: Yeah.

167
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,217
Rym: That got real old, real quick.

168
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:08,746
Scott: This has like one of these on each page of the spell book.

169
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:10,753
Scott: It's like an actual spell book.

170
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:12,900
Rym: So I can cast those spells.

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,382
Rym: Yes.

172
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:13,924
Rym: Oh man.

173
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:14,949
Rym: I'm kind of down with that.

174
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:23,867
Scott: And then under the spell book is of course the game, but it comes in this big box that looks like a book and is all fancified and has, you know, like a felt fuzzy interior.

175
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:28,644
Rym: So the operative question, will the U S release of this game have the same box?

176
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:31,071
Scott: Is there going to be a U S release of this game?

177
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:36,010
Rym: I would probably buy it site on scene for anything less than a hundred dollars.

178
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:47,420
Scott: If I were you, I would just go to like, uh, NCSX or one of those, you know, video game import sites and preorder this shit from Japan for the hundreds of dollars it's going to cost you because probably should, you probably should.

179
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,468
Rym: It'll probably be worth it to own that thing.

180
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:50,010
Scott: Yeah.

181
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,159
Rym: I mean, basically be buying the thing.

182
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,205
Rym: I can't read Japanese.

183
00:10:53,246 --> 00:10:54,332
Rym: I'm not going to play the game.

184
00:10:54,453 --> 00:11:03,349
Scott: I mean, when you see this thing, there's no way, if you're any sort of ghibli person, which is everybody in the world and you have a DS, how could you not go for this?

185
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:09,153
Scott: I would pay 200 bucks for it, but it's, you know, it's the trouble that I'd have to go through to pay the 200 bucks.

186
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:11,444
Scott: Then it's probably why I'm going to, I got some money.

187
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:12,871
Rym: I might just do it.

188
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:14,800
Rym: I'll let you all know how I turn out here.

189
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:15,322
Scott: All right.

190
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:16,588
Rym: But I got a little bit of news.

191
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:20,265
Rym: and this is, this comes partly after the fact that not that long ago.

192
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:25,990
Rym: Well, I guess it wasn't a while ago now, but anime Boston, the previous anime Boston had a little bit of trouble.

193
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:34,122
Scott: Well, anime Boston is sort of an infamous convention in that it's so close to us much closer than many other conventions such as, you know, uh, katsuka.

194
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:37,881
Rym: And yet not only have we never performed at anime Boston, we've never gone to anime Boston.

195
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:39,185
Rym: I've never been to Boston.

196
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:41,393
Scott: I've never been to Boston.

197
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,812
Scott: I've been to Boston like a hundred times, but I've never been to anime Boston.

198
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:47,600
Rym: I went north and south and north and south.

199
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:51,534
Scott: We should take an extra day off so you can see the Boston.

200
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:54,830
Rym: I actually plan to take several days off around it because I want to go see Steve.

201
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,935
Scott: Yeah, we can see Steve.

202
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:58,945
Scott: I haven't seen him in, uh, probably be working though.

203
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:00,209
Rym: Hi, whatever.

204
00:12:00,229 --> 00:12:01,353
Rym: He'll take time off.

205
00:12:01,393 --> 00:12:02,035
Scott: All right.

206
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:08,481
Rym: But, uh, anime Boston, you know, we, we talked about the news of the previous anime Boston and I don't need to get into that.

207
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:15,445
Rym: And of course, several anime Boston staff contacted us on the low down and kind of told us what the real deal was.

208
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:23,442
Rym: And we talked about that a bit, but I remember I said, Oh yeah, well, you know what, maybe we should go to anime Boston next time and, you know, do a bunch of panels and stuff.

209
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:39,780
Rym: Well, the staff is together and nothing is set in stone yet, but it is highly likely we are going to be at anime Boston most likely as guests or in the least as kind of, I don't know, built in panelists doing a whole bunch of our usual shtick.

210
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,569
Scott: That is a very nice, yeah.

211
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:44,900
Rym: Cause anime Boston, I don't think I don't want a table or anything.

212
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,588
Rym: We're pretty much just going to do live shows.

213
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:52,760
Rym: Maybe we should dust off some of the, uh, old classics just because this Con will have a lot of people who have never seen this before.

214
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,852
Scott: I don't know if I want to dust off any class.

215
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:57,500
Rym: Well, I don't want to dust off get geeky guy.

216
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,271
Rym: No, we have some other classics.

217
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:00,854
Rym: We could whip out.

218
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:08,968
Scott: There are definitely some panels that we could be running there and you know, maybe we'll just, you know, the, the conventions in what may, I think it's in may something.

219
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:13,990
Scott: we'll have panels set up by may and that'll be good practice for June, July, Otakon, right?

220
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,539
Scott: Otakon is going to be July this year, isn't it?

221
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:15,901
Rym: Yup.

222
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:17,289
Rym: And we're already setting that stuff up.

223
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,979
Rym: And of course, ConnectiCon next year.

224
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:25,882
Rym: I don't know if you talked about this yet, but there will be big, big announcements and changes in ConnectiCon.

225
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:40,794
Rym: And thus my second news, if you know anyone who you think should speak at ConnectiCon, which is not really an anime convention, it's more of a geek convention has a lot of webcomic stuff, but it has a lot of gaming and a lot of anime convention.

226
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:42,040
Rym: There's a lot of comic people there.

227
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,725
Rym: It's kind of a pretty much anyone who listens to GeekNights would have a good time at ConnectiCon, but it's everything but tech.

228
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:57,960
Rym: If you can think of anyone, I don't know, either professional or industry or a professor, anyone who you think could give what I would call an erudite panel.

229
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:01,631
Rym: We are putting out the kind of initial call for speakers.

230
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:05,649
Rym: So email us, email ConnectiCon, email someone, it'll get back to us.

231
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:07,400
Scott: We're not looking for the fan panels yet.

232
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,529
Scott: We're looking for the quarity panels.

233
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:12,300
Rym: The farrier panels, I believe is the word.

234
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,326
Scott: Yes, that is the word.

235
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:15,359
Rym: So is there any other anime news?

236
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,674
Scott: No, it's, it's really, you know, and Oh, Toonami died.

237
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:19,900
Scott: Did I talk about that before?

238
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:20,808
Rym: I don't think we did.

239
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:21,696
Scott: It's dead.

240
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,584
Rym: You know what?

241
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:23,520
Scott: Toonami died.

242
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:27,340
Scott: I could do a whole show on, let's do a whole show on it and then skip on it for now.

243
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,585
Rym: Wait, I can do the whole show right now.

244
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,932
Rym: Toonami died the day.

245
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,400
Rym: Moltar was no longer the host.

246
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:31,958
Scott: That's true.

247
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,660
Rym: And the body just spasmed for many years afterwards.

248
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,437
Scott: That's true.

249
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:41,539
Rym: I'd say that I would miss it, but I missed it a long time ago.

250
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:50,648
Rym: Hey, that music played.

251
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:54,339
Rym: Now we have a lot of people listening who probably have never listened to GeekNights before.

252
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:55,859
Scott: This is sort of a waste.

253
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,680
Rym: Yeah, but I feel like I should at least explain a little bit things of the day.

254
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,467
Rym: The bit we're about to do is pretty simple.

255
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:10,127
Rym: We talk about the thing of the day, the thing that in the last 24 hours or so has somehow impressed us more so than other things we've seen.

256
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:12,140
Rym: That's the extent of our bid.

257
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,820
Rym: We don't do so many kind of bits on this show, despite the original plan back in like 2005.

258
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,380
Scott: Now, maybe we'll get around to that someday.

259
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,680
Rym: So Scott, what is your thing of the day?

260
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:30,320
Scott: Well, you know, the guys from Engadget, the former guys from Engadget, you know, the Peter Rojas and the Ryan Block, they're doing their new GDGT thing.

261
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,640
Scott: Their podcast is back up and running.

262
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,320
Scott: You know, used to be the Engadget podcast, now is the GDGT podcast.

263
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:39,500
Scott: And the opening music for that was pretty cool.

264
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,318
Scott: Maybe we'll play it right now.

265
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:42,905
Scott: Or maybe we won't.

266
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,500
Scott: We'll find out if Rym decides to paste it in there.

267
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:49,280
Scott: But basically it's a pretty cool song and I was grooving to it.

268
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,780
Scott: So I went to find out what it was and, you know, I wanted to download it, of course.

269
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:57,999
Scott: And I found a free and legal way to download it.

270
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:05,840
Scott: Wouldn't you know, there's apparently some sort of, at least it looks like a record label called Ghostly International and some sort of record label.

271
00:16:06,502 --> 00:16:09,400
Scott: And they had a little partnership with Adult Swim.

272
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:13,780
Scott: So on Adult Swim dot com, there's an album called Ghostly Swim.

273
00:16:14,902 --> 00:16:18,180
Scott: And you can just download this whole album for free on their website.

274
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:19,282
Scott: Yeah.

275
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:30,140
Scott: And it's got a whole bunch of music that I kind of like, sort of ambient, you know, sort of electronic ish, groovy music, a little Halloween vibe, a little ghostliness.

276
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:33,074
Scott: And the I really like the first track.

277
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:34,280
Scott: The first track's pretty great.

278
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:40,340
Scott: The GDGT theme song track is the final track, which is Night Court by Muxmool.

279
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:46,320
Scott: And there is also a couple exclusive videos there for, in fact, those two songs.

280
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,280
Scott: The first track, which is Triple Chrome Dipped by Mitchna, I think.

281
00:16:51,982 --> 00:16:55,240
Scott: And there's, you know, there's two music videos and a whole album of free music.

282
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:56,325
Scott: I like it.

283
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:57,431
Scott: Why not?

284
00:16:58,014 --> 00:16:59,180
Scott: Legitimately, legally free.

285
00:16:59,800 --> 00:16:59,982
Rym: All right.

286
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:01,860
Rym: So it's very rare.

287
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:08,859
Rym: I mean, there was the big Webcomics boom, but it's been a very rare circumstance where I would, I guess, add a Webcomic to my repertoire.

288
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,640
Rym: And what have we added since the boom?

289
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:11,342
Rym: Dr.

290
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:19,339
Rym: McNinja, XKCD, Order the Stick, Anime News Nina, I guess that's pretty much it.

291
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,000
Rym: But it just so happens that there is a new Webcomic and a new Webcomic that I probably should have known about.

292
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,858
Rym: Well, there are new Webcomics every day.

293
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:29,800
Rym: Well, I should qualify that statement.

294
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,180
Scott: A new Webcomic we care about is this news.

295
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,920
Rym: Let me add another where clause to this SQL statement.

296
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,579
Rym: Basically, this Webcomic, Johnny Wander, is new.

297
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:47,420
Rym: And it happens to be by Yuko and Anath, two very close friends of ours and, in fact, members of the Front Row Crew.

298
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:48,458
Scott: Oh, we're biased.

299
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,720
Scott: You can't take us, our review, seriously.

300
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:51,858
Rym: I can say one thing.

301
00:17:52,320 --> 00:18:04,960
Rym: Yuko was Internet famous in the past for her Webcomic Fallen, which was kind of frighteningly popular to the point that even after she stopped updating it for a long, long time, she still to this day has fans and still to this day.

302
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,540
Scott: You know that if we stopped doing GeekNights, we would have the same situation.

303
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:11,700
Rym: Except multiply that by a magnitude or two.

304
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,460
Rym: And that's the number of people who still email her about this comic.

305
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,080
Scott: Really?

306
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,879
Scott: Could it be that many?

307
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,120
Rym: Well, I don't think you understand how many people read her.

308
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:21,959
Rym: More people read her live journal than listen to us.

309
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,840
Rym: But anyway, she stopped doing that, you know, college and all that.

310
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,920
Rym: Now, the other person involved in this, Ananth, he's half of Apple Geeks.

311
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:33,439
Rym: You may have heard of it.

312
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,038
Rym: It's somewhat popular out here.

313
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:36,780
Scott: Yeah, more popular than us, at least.

314
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,780
Rym: And basically this comic, the part of the reason I bring it up is that I find it funny into it's about them.

315
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,919
Rym: They are characters in it.

316
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,380
Rym: So it's them and our friend Conrad and, you know, some other.

317
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:57,599
Scott: It's a lot like, you know, it's artistically, it's not like real life comics, but, you know, the kind of comic it is, is like real life comics where it's just funny anecdotes from their everyday lives.

318
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,538
Scott: And because I know them, I know a lot of these events was perhaps there for some of them and such.

319
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,142
Scott: So it's.

320
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:06,099
Scott: it is double hilarious for us.

321
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:06,739
Rym: Yes.

322
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:14,679
Rym: It's kind of funny to me in the same way that bad boys in computer science was funny to me because it's bad boys in computer science had shit art compared to.

323
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:15,560
Rym: Yes, it did.

324
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,677
Rym: That is the one I could do.

325
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,195
Scott: I could do art better than BBOCS.

326
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:21,660
Rym: By the way, BBOCS author still owes me.

327
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,240
Rym: Nick, you fuck you owe me five bucks, dude.

328
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:24,880
Scott: That's right.

329
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,378
Rym: Seriously, I want it back.

330
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,158
Scott: I do.

331
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,219
Scott: I want my two dollars back.

332
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,200
Rym: But this is my thing of the day because I'm friends with them.

333
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:33,519
Rym: But, you know, they all move to DCs.

334
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,042
Rym: I haven't really.

335
00:19:34,324 --> 00:19:36,800
Rym: I didn't talk to them in a relatively short span.

336
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,678
Rym: And I find out suddenly that they're doing a webcomic.

337
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:43,177
Rym: I have to call them and ask about this webcomic.

338
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:43,980
Scott: Yep.

339
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,020
Rym: And also, I want to say one thing.

340
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,420
Rym: If you do happen to read it, the Conrad in it is exactly like that in the real world.

341
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:52,680
Scott: He's also in our forum.

342
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,319
Scott: You can talk to him.

343
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:53,596
Scott: Yes.

344
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:53,887
Rym: Yes.

345
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:58,516
Rym: In fact, all these people are in our forum anyway, except for John.

346
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:00,080
Scott: John.

347
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:00,393
Scott: John.

348
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:00,820
Rym: Yeah.

349
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,820
Rym: I don't know John that well.

350
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:03,380
Rym: I can't say anything about him other than that.

351
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,320
Rym: He's very tall.

352
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,319
Scott: I've only heard of this person second hand.

353
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:07,480
Rym: He is very tall.

354
00:20:07,682 --> 00:20:08,337
Scott: He is very tall.

355
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:09,180
Scott: I know.

356
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,999
Scott: I think I met him once at a dim sum.

357
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,320
Rym: So that was things of the day.

358
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,619
Rym: I guess we can move on to this.

359
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:16,559
Rym: The main bit.

360
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,740
Rym: So old listeners, you've heard all this before.

361
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:21,100
Scott: Yeah, you can stop listening.

362
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,760
Scott: New listeners.

363
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:22,049
Scott: Hello.

364
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:26,460
Scott: We'll teach you now about politics and manga.

365
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:34,620
Scott: Now, before we're going to do is I want to talk about politics and manga a little bit generally, and then I want to talk about a few specific political mangas.

366
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:40,900
Scott: So first thing you got to know about politics when it comes to manga is that nothing is realistic.

367
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,178
Scott: I mean, a lot of times you'll see and say, you know, American storytelling.

368
00:20:45,238 --> 00:20:47,760
Scott: more often, you know, for example, politics on TV.

369
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:51,420
Scott: A lot of times they try to pretend to be realistic.

370
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:53,179
Scott: Like look at a movie like Dave.

371
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:53,800
Scott: Right.

372
00:20:54,121 --> 00:21:00,402
Scott: I like that movie a lot, but it tries to pretend or put on the air is that this could really happen.

373
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:05,140
Scott: or we're trying to make some sort of representation of how things really are.

374
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,100
Scott: Manga, not so much, at least not the political manga I've read.

375
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,520
Scott: They just go if they sort of treat politics the way Harry Turtle Dove treats history.

376
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:26,020
Rym: Well, you know, see, it depends because the I guess the skew here is that manga that are released in America are not exactly representative of, I guess, the whole of manga.

377
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:26,799
Scott: That is true.

378
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:37,320
Rym: I mean, there are manga about golf that are Kazuo Koike and there are manga about golf that are about golf in a literal probably Jack Nicklaus Tiger Woods fashion.

379
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:37,672
Rym: Yes.

380
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:41,436
Rym: I'm sure there are political manga that are just like.

381
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:43,120
Rym: there's probably something about like Barack Obama.

382
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:45,519
Scott: Well, I mean, Obama, I don't know.

383
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,240
Scott: I mean, technically speaking, right.

384
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:50,300
Scott: A manga is just, you know, Japanese comics.

385
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:57,940
Scott: I'm sure that there are political comics, you know, political commentary comics, just like we have, you know, political cartoons in the Japanese newspapers.

386
00:21:58,382 --> 00:22:00,980
Scott: So would those not count as political manga?

387
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:03,200
Rym: Well, yes, yes, they would.

388
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,040
Scott: Yeah, I got to go find some now because I've never seen one of my entire life.

389
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,539
Scott: But it it reasons to be that they should exist now.

390
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:10,238
Rym: Yeah.

391
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:16,337
Rym: It's just sadly, I mean, even well, double sadly, one, we don't see stuff like that in America.

392
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:25,298
Rym: And two, even the stuff that is good and is political that we're going to talk about is for the most part out of print and none of you will be able to read it.

393
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,060
Scott: Yeah, that's that is really sad.

394
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:30,060
Rym: Luckily, one of them is very easy to get, at least.

395
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:42,320
Scott: Yeah, no, but all the political manga that get translated into English, right, either a have a lot of stuff going on with sort of world politics that someone from the U.S.

396
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:50,360
Scott: can, you know, have be more involved in it, you know, relate to it better, or they have a lot of sensationalist things going on.

397
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:57,240
Scott: So you can relate to it even though the politics is foreign to you, because Japanese politics is really foreign to anyone who is in Japanese.

398
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,419
Scott: I mean, it's crazy.

399
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,960
Scott: I mean, you know, for the most part, the Japanese political system is parliamentary, only they call it the diet, not the parliament.

400
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:12,040
Scott: And it works somewhat similar to the way it does in, you know, other parliamentary countries like Canada or Britain.

401
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,860
Scott: But that's that's only on the most surface and basic levels.

402
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,159
Scott: Really, Japanese politics are crazy.

403
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:24,080
Scott: They got like all these different prefectures and American politics is crazy.

404
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,539
Rym: They get all these states.

405
00:23:26,344 --> 00:23:27,777
Rym: I know I don't get that crap.

406
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,100
Rym: It's bullshit.

407
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:38,020
Scott: No, but like the laws about how you're allowed to campaign and, you know, the types of scandals and the things are gone with the types of scandals you're allowed to have.

408
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,138
Rym: But we're not going to talk about it.

409
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,079
Scott: Well, wait, that's the same is true here.

410
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,100
Rym: We're not going to talk about Japanese politics.

411
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,880
Rym: We're talking about Japanese comics, about politics.

412
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:55,558
Rym: And the other thing I'd like to say is that a lot of Japanese political comics, at least the ones we've read and like and are going to talk about, are really sensationalistic and over the top.

413
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,680
Rym: But one in particular is actually not.

414
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:02,497
Rym: And other than the drama that is added is incredible.

415
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:03,838
Rym: Well, it's weird.

416
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:09,897
Rym: It's incredibly realistic, like so perfectly accurate as to what actually goes on in one sense.

417
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,740
Rym: And yet in this other sense, completely wrong.

418
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:16,568
Rym: But the part is right about is the part I wish it was wrong about the part it was wrong about.

419
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,558
Rym: I wish it was right about.

420
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:21,500
Scott: No, I wish that was true for many things.

421
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,173
Rym: Oh, my God.

422
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:23,745
Rym: We'll talk about that.

423
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:26,840
Rym: one last, I think, because this is the most political of the political.

424
00:24:27,704 --> 00:24:28,999
Rym: I keep wanting to say podcast.

425
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,640
Rym: The alliteration is too strong.

426
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:30,996
Rym: Yeah.

427
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,620
Scott: The one thing I think, though, is like, you know, I'm sure they must exist.

428
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:41,940
Scott: But, you know, the political manga is actually seen to be like literal stories about politicians.

429
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,800
Scott: It's like a straight up drama.

430
00:24:44,302 --> 00:24:53,800
Scott: But all the characters are, you know, senators or congresspeople or people running for president or people running for office or something, you know, something along those lines.

431
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,800
Scott: In fact, I think all three of these involve elections in some way.

432
00:24:56,821 --> 00:24:57,034
Scott: Yes.

433
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:57,884
Rym: Yes.

434
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:01,880
Rym: I mean, one of them is called the first president of Japan.

435
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:02,458
Scott: Yeah.

436
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:02,876
Scott: Yeah.

437
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:05,120
Scott: They're all about, you know, elections and such.

438
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:11,100
Scott: And I don't you know, there are plenty of comics outside of Japan that deal with politics.

439
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,040
Scott: You know, political cartoons are in every country.

440
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:21,720
Scott: I've already discussed that, but not too many of them have straight up stories about politicians that are long running serial dramas.

441
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,800
Scott: I mean, there might be one out there, but I've never seen one.

442
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,960
Scott: You know, European comics.

443
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,699
Scott: Most of the ones I see are like histories or fantasies or sci fi or are those sorts of things.

444
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:35,360
Scott: You know, American comics, of course, are mostly superheroes.

445
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:43,180
Scott: Sometimes there are politicians in the superhero stories like there's always that one senator fucking with the X-Men and, you know, the president sometimes gets involved.

446
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,600
Rym: But but they're always like this side thing or they're there, but they're they're shallow.

447
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:47,768
Scott: Yeah.

448
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,887
Scott: It's like, you know, Marvel.

449
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,880
Scott: Civil War is not a political story.

450
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,120
Scott: It's just the government is involved.

451
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:58,280
Scott: The government is a character is a player in the greater story tries to have this sort of political.

452
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:07,860
Rym: It kind of pulls the V for Vendetta sort of, you know, there are the two kind of extremes and then they basically use that to make the superhero comic seem different, right?

453
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,500
Scott: It may have a political message, but it's not about politicians.

454
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,500
Scott: Politicians do not comprise the majority of the main characters.

455
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:23,460
Scott: But, you know, it's not a story about running for office or getting a bill passed or political maneuvering, you know, in a real world government.

456
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:24,579
Scott: It's it's something else.

457
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,479
Rym: But I will say this.

458
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:33,320
Rym: The three comics we really want to talk about tonight, the politicians in them are superheroes, but their special moves are not punch.

459
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:34,868
Rym: They are dramatic.

460
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:36,899
Rym: speech or ate that cake.

461
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,419
Scott: I was going to make a joke about cake, but you right then.

462
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,276
Scott: But you got me.

463
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:41,580
Scott: All right.

464
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,739
Scott: So let's get a move on.

465
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,700
Rym: Let's start with the simplest one to talk about.

466
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,280
Rym: Also, the one that's probably the most dramatically dramatic.

467
00:26:51,141 --> 00:27:03,800
Rym: It's all about the first president of Japan, which is basically a fanboy masturbatory session about the way Japanese politics should be if the world was awesome.

468
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:09,140
Scott: First president of Japan is a story because, you know, Japan, like I said, is a prime minister and a parliament.

469
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,843
Scott: So this is a story about, you know, what if it's sort of an alternate future kind of thing where?

470
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:19,820
Scott: what if Japan had a president instead of a prime minister?

471
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,840
Scott: They switched up their whole government and fixed the whole thing to make it awesome.

472
00:27:23,261 --> 00:27:33,120
Scott: And then even though crazy shit went down, like war between China and Taiwan and such, Japan was in there and everything was all right because that president of Japan was so awesome.

473
00:27:33,323 --> 00:27:34,119
Rym: But not just him.

474
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:35,880
Rym: Everyone is awesome.

475
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,800
Rym: And that's what makes this.

476
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,719
Rym: This is basically I would almost call it a superhero comic straight up, except instead of spandex, they all wear suits.

477
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Rym: It's just it's so it's so over the top.

478
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,228
Rym: And yet nothing happens.

479
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:51,800
Rym: that is in any way like metaphysical or superpowers.

480
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,010
Rym: It's just it's over the top.

481
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,400
Rym: in this way that manga is very good at doing.

482
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:02,280
Rym: And American comics aren't as well, I guess, mainstream American comics by and large are not as good at doing well.

483
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:17,020
Scott: Much like, you know, DMZ, an American comic where it sort of has like this ludicrous political situation of, you know, the majority of the United States having a giant civil war with, you know, the official United States and then having a DMZ in New York City.

484
00:28:17,323 --> 00:28:18,740
Scott: Sort of a ludicrous situation.

485
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:33,260
Scott: First, President Japan is also a ludicrous situation, but in the ludicrous situation, you know, within that context, if you ignore the fact that the context is unreasonable, what happens within the context makes sense, you know, in the setting.

486
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,560
Scott: And it's super dramatic and super awesome.

487
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,600
Rym: The context is not that unreasonable.

488
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,740
Scott: The way that it's not as unreasonable as DMZ, but it's still unreasonable.

489
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,680
Rym: It's not that unreasonable.

490
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,940
Rym: What is unreasonable is the way the people who are the characters react to this situation.

491
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:52,393
Rym: It is the kind of thing, you know, in history, you always read.

492
00:28:52,855 --> 00:29:01,480
Rym: any time you read a history book, there's always kind of the linchpin historical moment, the point where something, you know, awesome or dramatic could have happened.

493
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:04,460
Rym: But more often than not, the lame thing happens instead.

494
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,078
Rym: The guy surrenders, the guy makes the blunder, the king gives up.

495
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:08,584
Scott: Yep.

496
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,018
Scott: Instead of, you know, something awesome happening, like someone going, ha ha.

497
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:15,540
Scott: And then, oh my God, everything's fixed.

498
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:19,000
Scott: You know, it's usually status quo maintained.

499
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:20,037
Scott: Nothing to see.

500
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,038
Scott: Nothing to see here.

501
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,018
Scott: Everybody go home.

502
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:22,400
Rym: Yep.

503
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:38,060
Rym: I mean, of course, my favorite moment is, well, maybe not because he lost, but when the last empire emperor of Rome cast off his regalia and flung himself into the fighting to die, that was a good, he could have just totally surrendered or ran away and just disappeared in history.

504
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:39,738
Rym: But no, he had to do the thing.

505
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:40,758
Scott: Yeah.

506
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,180
Rym: But first president of Japan, basically, it's not just OMG Japan as a president.

507
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,519
Rym: It's all right.

508
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,759
Rym: Japan is going to have a president very soon.

509
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:53,180
Rym: We're in the process of doing this transition.

510
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:55,300
Rym: Oh shit.

511
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,920
Rym: China invades Taiwan.

512
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,435
Rym: Oh shit.

513
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,919
Rym: North Korea goes all berserk.

514
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,280
Rym: Oh man, everything's going crazy.

515
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:07,460
Rym: And maybe we should give up the US Japan defense thing and section nine and have a military and, oh crap, there's a new coming.

516
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:08,140
Rym: What do we do?

517
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:09,320
Rym: I'm going to stand here.

518
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,517
Rym: It's a done and I know it.

519
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,079
Rym: And that's pretty much all that goes on.

520
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,822
Scott: That's something important to mention here because it's sort of central to all of Japanese politics.

521
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:23,359
Scott: is way back when Japan, after world war two, you know, Japan became, you know, good, right?

522
00:30:24,661 --> 00:30:31,980
Scott: You know, in the Japanese constitution, there is, you know, a section that says you Japan cannot have a military.

523
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:38,960
Scott: They can have, you know, and, you know, over time, basically the situation is that Japan can have the Japanese self-defense force.

524
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,400
Rym: So even that is actually a kind of a stretch.

525
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,938
Scott: It is.

526
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,980
Scott: It's sort of as loophole.

527
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,759
Scott: It's sort of a, well, the thing is, it's the kind of thing a Supreme Court might interpret as being unconstitutional.

528
00:30:49,746 --> 00:30:50,700
Rym: It's kind of a loophole.

529
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,200
Rym: It's one of those things where everyone involved says, you know what?

530
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:56,038
Rym: It's best to just keep it the way it is.

531
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:56,498
Scott: Yeah.

532
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,035
Scott: Basically, Japan has a military force, the Japanese self-defense force.

533
00:31:00,356 --> 00:31:01,120
Scott: that is not allowed.

534
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:10,140
Scott: It's not allowed to project, not only by, you know, and it's not, you know, some international law that says Japan, you can't project your military force.

535
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,040
Scott: It's a Japanese law that says Japan cannot project its own military force.

536
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:19,140
Scott: Imagine if the US Constitution said the US is not allowed to attack anybody.

537
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:29,460
Scott: All US military forces have to stay in the United States, and they can only do anything if it means physically protecting the United States from physical attacks.

538
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:45,620
Scott: And, you know, in Japanese politics, especially if you're doing, you know, dramatic Japanese political manga, the question of whether or not to keep or get rid of, you know, this, you know, section of the constitution is pretty big deal.

539
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,079
Rym: It's also, remember, a lot of the people who read a lot of these comics are military fanboys or otaku of some degree.

540
00:31:52,900 --> 00:32:00,179
Rym: And one of the kind of ultimate fantasies of these people is Japan gets rid of Article 9 and becomes totally awesome.

541
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,400
Scott: Cause the thing about Japan has wicked awesome technologies.

542
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,320
Scott: You know, they were one of the most advanced places technologically on earth.

543
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:19,420
Rym: That's actually one of the plot points in first president of Japan, where Japan has the, I think the, some special AWACS or the Aegis cruisers, where they know where all the Chinese nuclear subs are in the straits of Taiwan.

544
00:32:20,162 --> 00:32:23,200
Rym: And the US doesn't have the capability to detect them quickly enough.

545
00:32:23,782 --> 00:32:27,640
Rym: And Japan makes a secret deal with the US to totally tell them where they are.

546
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:37,360
Rym: And then there's this great scene where the Chinese military guy who was just seized power because there's a coup in China is like, OMG, nuke subs.

547
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:41,760
Rym: And then his advisor is like, ah, we haven't heard from them in a while.

548
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,739
Rym: I'm sure everything's okay, but, uh, uh, we don't know where they are.

549
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:47,577
Rym: Things aren't going so well.

550
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:48,558
Scott: Oh no.

551
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,299
Rym: I don't want to be the one to tell you this.

552
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,800
Scott: You can see how bring section nine into it, you know, with the technological superiority.

553
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,060
Rym: Article nine is something else.

554
00:32:57,903 --> 00:32:58,620
Scott: Section nine, lol.

555
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:10,875
Rym: Article nine, quote, aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.

556
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:17,940
Rym: in order to accomplish the aim of the proceeding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential will never be maintained.

557
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,220
Rym: The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.

558
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:23,340
Rym: That's pretty straightforward.

559
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,156
Rym: Yeah.

560
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,280
Scott: There's not a real lot of interpretation there.

561
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:30,940
Scott: I was going to see how the Japanese self-defense force is unconstitutional.

562
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:39,900
Rym: I was going to quote it sooner, but, uh, I kept finding the Japanese and it was basically Kanji Kanji Kanji Kanji Kanji Kanji Kanji.

563
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:44,700
Scott: So you can see why this is a pretty easy thing to tell a dramatic story about.

564
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:51,120
Scott: Cause you know, any story about someone pushing for a constitutional management is going to be pretty high energy, pretty fantastic.

565
00:33:51,542 --> 00:34:09,317
Scott: And then you throw in the high technology, you throw in, you know, the international war, you already got three pretty big aspects to lean on is going to be good stuff going on, especially for the military fan boys who want to see crazy high-tech Japanese military of awesomeness satellite lasers and shit

566
00:34:09,337 --> 00:34:09,599
Rym: like that.

567
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,219
Rym: All three of these comics have something in common and that they basically they're character driven more than like that.

568
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,259
Rym: You're not going to see a lot of the fighting or the action or any of that.

569
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:28,600
Rym: You'll see those as kind of establishing shots, but all the real action scenes, like the war is not tanks fighting with tanks and fighter jets fighting with fighter jets.

570
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:42,099
Rym: It's the president watching his monitor and talking to people, the military dictator watching his monitor and talking to people, the president of Taiwan, totally talking in a secret chat room onto internet with the president of Japan.

571
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:44,139
Rym: That was a great scene.

572
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:53,036
Rym: They're just totally talking in this like political forum about what they're going to do and all the, and they read what all the other people say, but no one else knows that it's actually them.

573
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:53,757
Rym: Yep.

574
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:56,940
Scott: So first president of Japan, I think it's three volumes.

575
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,480
Rym: I think at least three.

576
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:58,985
Rym: It's 176 pages.

577
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,840
Scott: I think 176 pages is just one volume, right?

578
00:35:04,824 --> 00:35:05,119
Rym: I don't know.

579
00:35:05,242 --> 00:35:05,478
Rym: Oh yeah.

580
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:06,160
Rym: Just volume one.

581
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:06,680
Rym: I'm sorry.

582
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:07,055
Rym: Yeah.

583
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:08,159
Rym: I pulled up the wrong webpage.

584
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:08,680
Rym: Yeah.

585
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:08,940
Rym: Yeah.

586
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:13,756
Rym: It's written by Kadaka Yoshiki who honestly, I don't know that much about compared to the other people we're going to talk about.

587
00:35:14,201 --> 00:35:17,620
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, the art is pretty standard art.

588
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,820
Scott: You know, they look like people.

589
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,619
Scott: It's not anything that's going to blow you away or anything like that.

590
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,719
Rym: Political people.

591
00:35:23,053 --> 00:35:23,200
Rym: Yeah.

592
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:32,999
Scott: It's just a bunch of it's drawings of guys in suits, drawings of boats, really, really dramatically fist out mouth open scowling.

593
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:33,499
Scott: Yeah.

594
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,320
Scott: You know, pictures of flags and missiles and that sort of thing, you know, and you, it's as out of print.

595
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,080
Scott: It was published by Raijin comics.

596
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:42,136
Scott: It's one of those dealies.

597
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:44,800
Scott: Um, it's these little tiny blue books.

598
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,940
Scott: You should be able to find them.

599
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,500
Scott: They're in English.

600
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,340
Rym: You'll find them in the dollar bid at a comic con for a dollar.

601
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:57,360
Scott: You're not going to find them on the shelf because they're out of print for quite a while, but in there, in every discount bin of manga I've ever seen, I've seen first presence of Japan.

602
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,560
Scott: It's an easy pickup.

603
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,398
Rym: I'll put it this way.

604
00:36:00,321 --> 00:36:06,420
Rym: And I'm not going to try to sell it to you, but it's so cheap that even if you end up hating it, it's totally worth the money.

605
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,200
Rym: And you're probably not going to hate it because it's a, it's a, it's a ride to put it gently.

606
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,937
Rym: It is real fun.

607
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,920
Scott: It's not like something epic and amazing.

608
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:21,800
Rym: It's not, you know, one of the greatest comics of all time, but it's definitely the Tom Clancy slash West wing version of this sort of thing.

609
00:36:21,984 --> 00:36:22,558
Rym: Absolutely.

610
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:23,439
Scott: All right.

611
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:32,838
Rym: So shall we talk about, uh, the one, well, we can talk about the one that is much more relevant, but at the same time, which cannot be obtained, I don't know.

612
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:34,580
Scott: Let's talk about sanctuary.

613
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,120
Rym: Okay.

614
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,760
Rym: So sanctuary, I'm sorry, is so out of print.

615
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,959
Rym: It took us a long time to get ahold of all of it.

616
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:48,980
Rym: And the sad thing is we've been talking about, we've, we've done live shows and like every con we go to about sanctuary.

617
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:49,839
Scott: We do more.

618
00:36:50,422 --> 00:37:00,320
Scott: There's, I think sanctuary, we, if you take all the talking about manga we've done, I think more than 33% of the manga talk we have done is just promoting sanctuary.

619
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:02,720
Rym: And it is, it's not like it's the best manga in the world.

620
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,720
Rym: It's actually not even close to that.

621
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:11,040
Rym: But the thing is of this kind of manga, it's one of the only ones that's ever been released in America.

622
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:16,378
Scott: So sanctuary can best be described as a political erotic thriller, right?

623
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:20,540
Rym: If that sounds up your alley, this is up your alley in a way you can't imagine.

624
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,040
Scott: This is pretty much the best political erotic thriller I've ever seen.

625
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,980
Rym: It's, it's pretty much the story.

626
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:40,740
Rym: And again, it's similar in terms of, I guess the way it's presented to like first president of Japan, but it's much more realistic in many ways, but at the same time, it still definitely has that unrealistic, dramatic little to it.

627
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:48,580
Rym: The story is basically about Japan is a kind of corrupt, slow moving political system.

628
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,920
Rym: The Japanese people are complacent and these two kids were unrelated.

629
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,780
Rym: Their parents work in Cambodia.

630
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:00,197
Rym: One thing leads to another, their parents are murdered and they end up barely surviving the killing fields.

631
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,395
Rym: Yes.

632
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,499
Rym: They, they returned to Japan as young kids.

633
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:21,619
Rym: They're, you know, they get foster families, they're enrolled into school and they decide that because of their experiences and because of the way the people of Japan are versus the way they should be, that they are going to dedicate the rest of their lives to changing Japan in a fundamental way.

634
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,799
Rym: And the way they decide to do this is that they draw lots.

635
00:38:26,801 --> 00:38:29,580
Rym: One of them will take the high road, will stay in school.

636
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,979
Rym: We'll get supported by the other one.

637
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:32,020
Rym: We'll go to college.

638
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,280
Rym: We'll join the political system.

639
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:41,600
Rym: We'll do whatever it takes, no matter what they have to stoop to, no matter how high, they will enter politics and they will become prime minister.

640
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:55,099
Rym: The other one is going to drop out of school, join the Yakuza, do whatever it takes, no matter how low they have to sink to become the head of the Yakuza and then use all of that money and all of that power to prop the first one out.

641
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:57,680
Scott: So it's the ultimate tag team.

642
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,440
Scott: You basically have the king of all the crime and then the king of all the government.

643
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:04,800
Scott: So it's like you become the king of the Yakuza.

644
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,600
Scott: I'll become the prime minister and we'll take over this whole country.

645
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:13,476
Scott: Let's say they both teamed up and went into politics together and didn't do the Yakuza thing, right?

646
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:21,776
Scott: Well, being prime minister, the head of the Yakuza has a lot of control over what goes on.

647
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,800
Scott: They can blackmail you and all these horrible things.

648
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,240
Scott: Just controlling the Yakuza, well, that's also not so good.

649
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,319
Scott: The government, the police can come cracking down on the Yakuza and take you out.

650
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:32,480
Scott: So you need to control both these things.

651
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,780
Scott: If you control both these things, you can control the above world and the underworld.

652
00:39:37,304 --> 00:39:39,219
Scott: And no one can stop you.

653
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:55,960
Rym: And let me tell you, is this and I mean, if you read FPOJ with the first president of Japan, it's easy to get the level of style and sophistication and subtlety and just storytelling and art and everything is an order of magnitude above.

654
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,400
Rym: This is this is an ultimate banger.

655
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:06,380
Scott: We're looking at the writer of Sanctuary, Isho Fumimura, aka Buronsan, aka the guy who worked on Fist of the North Star.

656
00:40:06,644 --> 00:40:06,929
Scott: No can.

657
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:19,140
Scott: So you take that and then take the artist, Ryuichi Ikigami, the artist of, you know, Crying Freeman and such and Samurai Crusader, Samurai Crusader is awesome.

658
00:40:19,344 --> 00:40:19,636
Scott: It is.

659
00:40:20,363 --> 00:40:22,419
Scott: And put them together on a team.

660
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,699
Scott: And Sanctuary is the ultimate genius that is produced.

661
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:28,247
Scott: Sanctuary is how many volumes is?

662
00:40:28,307 --> 00:40:29,151
Scott: it's a lot of volume.

663
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:30,719
Rym: eight, I think eight or nine.

664
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:31,340
Scott: Yeah.

665
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,599
Scott: Well, isn't it more volumes in Japan than the US?

666
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:35,880
Rym: I always forget.

667
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,120
Rym: It doesn't mention that like anyone out there is going to actually be able to read it.

668
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,940
Scott: This is like wicked out of print.

669
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:47,238
Scott: But if you see it, pick up whatever volume you can, even if it's just ten copies of volume one, just buy all of them.

670
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:55,300
Scott: Anything it takes to get volumes of Sanctuary just hoard them and then we'll all distribute them amongst people who, you know, we know are good for it.

671
00:40:55,522 --> 00:40:56,420
Scott: That's the current plan.

672
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,240
Rym: Anyone who is a little underhanded because it's so out of print.

673
00:40:59,843 --> 00:41:01,219
Rym: There are torrents out there.

674
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:06,379
Rym: I have seen entire collections of translated or scanned Sanctuary out there.

675
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,118
Scott: Yeah, I would not consider it amoral to even though it might technically be illegal to go and get those.

676
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,280
Rym: But I mean, the kinds of scenes.

677
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,480
Rym: I mean, this is a manga where a cruise ship is filled with Yakuza.

678
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,080
Rym: You know, there's Yakuza over another part of Japan and they're causing trouble.

679
00:41:22,501 --> 00:41:23,959
Rym: So what does the awesome Yakuza do?

680
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:29,140
Rym: They fill up an entire cruise ship with Yakuza and just park it off the coast.

681
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:45,779
Rym: And there's this beautiful two page spread of just a lot of very intimidating looking men standing there, looking dramatic over the edge of this cruise ship and a bunch of other very angry, imposing men looking very angry and somewhat frightened, looking up at this cruise ship going, oh, shit.

682
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:56,160
Scott: The earlier volumes concentrate a lot more on the Yakuza stuff because it takes time to move up in, you know, the actual a lot longer to move up in the actual government than it took to move up in the Yakuza.

683
00:41:56,482 --> 00:42:01,440
Scott: You know, because all this time, you know, because they got one guy dropped out of school and immediately went in the Yakuza.

684
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,200
Scott: He's been moving up for quite some time.

685
00:42:03,461 --> 00:42:11,520
Scott: The other guy was still going through school, graduating, you know, working his way up, you know, into being like an assistant of, you know, some dead men.

686
00:42:11,681 --> 00:42:14,600
Scott: And, you know, it takes a lot longer to move up in that area.

687
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,700
Scott: So the earlier volumes concentrate a lot more on the Yakuza action.

688
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,000
Scott: But later on, it's they really become intertwined and the politics get pretty heavy.

689
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:30,867
Scott: You've got making coalitions, breaking coalitions, making alliances with other dead men, trying to win elections, trying to lose.

690
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:39,738
Rym: all those disenfranchised and just, you know, completely apathetic junior senators end up getting inspired and drunk and go off with those biker gang kids.

691
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:50,898
Scott: And there are so many just amazing, iconic scenes in this manga, expose people, exposing other people's scandals, you know, taking, you know, get people getting dirty money, getting clean money.

692
00:42:51,225 --> 00:42:52,019
Rym: The gecky guy thing.

693
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,300
Rym: I mean, there there's this great scene where a big scandal is exposed.

694
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,718
Rym: They're like, you blah, blah, blah.

695
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,278
Rym: Yakuza something connection, blah, blah, blah.

696
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:07,195
Rym: And the political guy basically looks at the camera and all the press and says, Yep, what of it?

697
00:43:07,847 --> 00:43:08,340
Scott: Oh, snaps.

698
00:43:08,622 --> 00:43:09,979
Rym: And no one knows what to do.

699
00:43:10,142 --> 00:43:11,299
Rym: And then all hell breaks loose.

700
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,580
Scott: I mean, like every time, you know, you know, a politician's act in the world, right?

701
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:23,020
Scott: Someone says a scandal and they go and they'll say something like either, you know, I'm deeply sorry for the blah, blah, blah.

702
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,720
Rym: Imagine if Bill Clinton had said, Yep, it sucks.

703
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,278
Rym: But you know what?

704
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:27,039
Rym: I did it.

705
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:27,778
Rym: Here's pictures.

706
00:43:28,282 --> 00:43:29,140
Scott: No, even better.

707
00:43:29,281 --> 00:43:29,949
Scott: What if?

708
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:30,820
Scott: what was his name?

709
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,380
Scott: Elliot Spitzer was like, Yeah, I had a bunch of hookers in the hotel.

710
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:34,937
Scott: It was hot.

711
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:37,999
Scott: That's basically that's what sanctuary is like.

712
00:43:38,921 --> 00:43:50,660
Rym: I mean, the thing is, if you need any sort of quick impression, there there is a scene where there's a kind of a young member of the Yakuza who who's you know, he works with the main characters and he has his young wife and all this sort of thing.

713
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:57,559
Rym: You like this guy a lot, but there's a question that is asked, which is why did you become a member of the Yakuza?

714
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,299
Rym: Why did you choose this life?

715
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:10,300
Rym: And there's this whole scene where they look down at all the people walking in the streets, the salarymen that just the normal everyday people so apathetic, so insulated from the real world, so uninspired.

716
00:44:11,242 --> 00:44:13,260
Rym: And, you know, they talked about how their eyes are dead.

717
00:44:13,502 --> 00:44:15,660
Rym: And I don't want to be one of those people.

718
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,099
Rym: I want anything other than to be one of those people.

719
00:44:19,082 --> 00:44:23,998
Rym: And there's a flashback to another point where they ask the main character, why did you become a Yakuza?

720
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:31,439
Rym: And he looks up and says, because I can do in a single day what it takes a normal man 30 years to accomplish.

721
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,460
Rym: Oh, that that line sums up everything that is sanctuary.

722
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,092
Rym: Oh, my God.

723
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:38,639
Rym: Is this an amazing comic slash manga?

724
00:44:39,293 --> 00:44:39,440
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:46,759
Scott: Just to you know, to clarify, I guess, you know, we use the word Gekiga a few times, Gekiga was sort of this for people who don't know.

726
00:44:47,344 --> 00:44:48,920
Scott: You know, there's manga, right?

727
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,164
Scott: Manga translates to.

728
00:44:51,184 --> 00:44:57,600
Scott: it is the word for comics in Japanese, but it translates into irresponsible pictures.

729
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:05,580
Scott: So sort of the word manga inherent in the word is sort of the feeling of comedy or or, you know, non seriousness.

730
00:45:06,242 --> 00:45:13,860
Scott: And Yoshihiro Tatsumi and a bunch of other guys back in the 60s and 70s, whatnot, they decided they were going to make serious manga.

731
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:18,120
Scott: You can't make serious manga because that's a serious, irresponsible picture.

732
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:18,859
Scott: That didn't make sense.

733
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,980
Scott: So they made Gekiga, which is dramatic.

734
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:24,340
Rym: It's very much like in America.

735
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,860
Rym: Suddenly we had graphic novels.

736
00:45:27,221 --> 00:45:29,860
Rym: No, no, not a comic, a graphic novel.

737
00:45:30,321 --> 00:45:43,240
Scott: Yeah, it's very similar to it's sort of a combination of, you know, our crime and Will Eisner, you know, our crime sort of took comics out there and tried to do things that were a little more racy, a little more extreme, a little more on the edge.

738
00:45:43,682 --> 00:45:47,840
Scott: And Will Eisner tried to, you know, say, hey, you know, this is serious business here.

739
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,860
Scott: This isn't just all fun and games for the kiddies.

740
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,200
Scott: You know, comics can be, you know, serious art.

741
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:54,680
Scott: And you combine those two ideas together.

742
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,360
Scott: And that's sort of what the Gekiga movement was in Japan.

743
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,700
Scott: Now, the comics that we're talking about now, you know, are not really Gekiga.

744
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:05,640
Scott: They have many inspirations from the Gekiga movement, but they are not Gekiga.

745
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:07,460
Scott: What they are is Seinen.

746
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:13,000
Scott: Now, when you buy your mangas at the store, right, you notice that they talk about Shoujo and Shounen, right?

747
00:46:13,221 --> 00:46:16,500
Rym: Shoujo marketed girls, Shounen marketed boys.

748
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:17,398
Scott: Exactly.

749
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,439
Scott: That's how you know, it's not like in the in the U.S.

750
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,239
Scott: where you separate genres by like, well, they do that there, too.

751
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:23,286
Scott: But, you know, in the

752
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:23,688
Scott: U.S.,

753
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:25,560
Scott: we don't really say this is for guys.

754
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,400
Scott: This is for girls in the toy store.

755
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:28,540
Rym: It's also in the bookstore.

756
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,020
Scott: We say this is a fantasy.

757
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:30,836
Scott: This is a sci fi.

758
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:31,900
Scott: This is a mystery.

759
00:46:32,001 --> 00:46:32,440
Scott: This is right.

760
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:39,460
Rym: But don't be confused too much, because while Japan like they categorize their comics based on, you know, where they're published and who the demographic is.

761
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:41,840
Rym: But that's kind of the primary demographic.

762
00:46:41,981 --> 00:46:45,020
Rym: A lot of boys read Shoujo and a lot of girls read Shounen.

763
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,319
Scott: I read lots of Shoujo.

764
00:46:46,661 --> 00:46:47,156
Rym: I do, too.

765
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,920
Scott: But all these are Seinen, right?

766
00:46:50,180 --> 00:47:02,438
Scott: Now, Shoujo and Shounen are actually for little girls and little boys, technically, you know, show like Shounen Jump, Dragon Ball Z. That's for like, you know, elementary school, middle school, you know, boys, Naruto and stuff like that.

767
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:13,480
Rym: All you comic people out there who don't maybe not read a lot of manga or you see the kind of Tokyo pop Shoujo stuff in the manga section and you just kind of write off manga as being that sort of thing or Dragon Ball Z or whatever.

768
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:18,494
Rym: In Japan, you know, the stuff you want to read that you will like is called Seinen and Jose.

769
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,217
Scott: Right.

770
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,160
Scott: Seinen is for like college dudes and older than that.

771
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,400
Scott: And, you know, Jose is for college girls and older than that.

772
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,276
Scott: And that stuff isn't published in the U.S.

773
00:47:27,316 --> 00:47:27,760
Scott: too often.

774
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,700
Scott: I mean, this Seinen stuff is out of print.

775
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,520
Scott: Now, don't be confused by the Seinen.

776
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,420
Scott: There's Moe Seinen and just regular Seinen.

777
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,100
Scott: And Moe Seinen is like, you know, lots of cheesecake type action.

778
00:47:39,241 --> 00:47:42,295
Rym: Or also like Azumanga Daiya or Yotsuba.

779
00:47:43,502 --> 00:47:44,719
Scott: Those are Moe Seinen's.

780
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,200
Scott: This is not Moe Seinen.

781
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,899
Scott: This is just sort of regular Seinen.

782
00:47:48,922 --> 00:47:52,020
Scott: But anyway, that's just a little lesson there for you people.

783
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:58,760
Scott: So the final comic I guess we'll talk about here is perhaps it's somewhat easy to get.

784
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,360
Scott: It's easier to get than sanctuary, but it's not as easy to get as it once was.

785
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:09,960
Rym: I have me, us and other friends of ours have acquired between us four complete sets of two really four complete sets.

786
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:10,698
Scott: We have won.

787
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:13,039
Rym: And I know three other people who have won.

788
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,379
Scott: It's funny that we have four complete sets to go with the four Eisner Awards that it was nominated for.

789
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,840
Rym: I was going to bring up the Eisner Awards story and art were both done by Kaiji Kawaguchi.

790
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,837
Rym: Remember that name?

791
00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:29,559
Scott: That's a very important name because see, Kaiji Kawaguchi is not only a manga writer and artist.

792
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:39,760
Scott: He actually, in researching this comic, came over to the United States and followed around the US election.

793
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:48,419
Scott: He went around on the campaign trail studying and seeing what people were doing and learning people's names and seeing everything that was going on.

794
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:58,480
Rym: You see, this comic is about straight up the 2000 presidential race in the United States from before the primaries until after the election.

795
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:03,020
Rym: But it's with a little bit of a twist because it was just following the election.

796
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,180
Rym: Well, we know what happened and they could dramatize it.

797
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,240
Rym: But that wouldn't be that interesting.

798
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:09,620
Rym: It's that election.

799
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,660
Rym: Now, a lot of the names are changed and they changed kind of a lot of the Republicans.

800
00:49:13,821 --> 00:49:21,800
Rym: But the Republican who ends up getting the nomination is kind of an amalgamation of several prominent Republicans at the time just to make the story work.

801
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,980
Scott: And there are a lot of names changed to protect the innocent.

802
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:31,600
Scott: You know, the current president at the time is Bill, Bill and his wife, Ellery.

803
00:49:32,521 --> 00:49:40,380
Rym: And his his vice president, who is running for the nomination for president in that election is Al Noah.

804
00:49:42,722 --> 00:49:45,940
Rym: But despite all this, there's there's also one more dark horse.

805
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:50,539
Rym: There's a dark horse candidate who's in the primaries, not getting a lot of attention, not pulling that well.

806
00:49:51,682 --> 00:49:55,859
Rym: And he is the half Japanese senator from Hawaii.

807
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:58,000
Rym: He's a Democrat.

808
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,480
Rym: He's seeking the nomination of the Democratic Party.

809
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:05,740
Scott: Now, the thing is, you know, if you're a Republican or a Democrat, it doesn't really matter.

810
00:50:06,122 --> 00:50:14,060
Scott: Even though this manga is about a Democrat and you're going to be rooting for a Democrat, because sort of the issues don't come into it too much.

811
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:14,700
Scott: Right.

812
00:50:15,281 --> 00:50:20,300
Scott: And even when the issues do come into it, like gun control is a pretty prominent issue that is addressed.

813
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,340
Rym: You'll be surprised by his stances.

814
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:22,898
Scott: Yes.

815
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:24,140
Scott: You'll be very surprised.

816
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:28,340
Scott: The guy does a lot of you know, it's all fictional.

817
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:32,120
Scott: Obviously, the character, the main character is the fictional part of the story does.

818
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:37,240
Scott: And the reason that, you know, he does so well, obviously, he does well to make it through five volumes.

819
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:37,960
Scott: Right.

820
00:50:38,162 --> 00:50:39,199
Rym: Oh, oh, God.

821
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,760
Rym: Bill's last name is actually mentioned in the manga.

822
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,356
Scott: Oh, what is it?

823
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,354
Scott: Clyde on.

824
00:50:44,522 --> 00:50:45,250
Scott: Oh, Clyde on.

825
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:48,000
Scott: He does.

826
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,807
Scott: He has a lot of stances.

827
00:50:49,868 --> 00:50:52,400
Scott: that sort of appeal evenly across the board.

828
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,420
Scott: The one of my favorite scenes is where he goes into this bar in Texas.

829
00:50:56,764 --> 00:50:58,140
Rym: Oh, that's one of the cowboys.

830
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,840
Scott: And they know he's running for president and they confront him.

831
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,580
Scott: And, you know, in their cowboy way, like, you know, what's your problem?

832
00:51:06,742 --> 00:51:07,800
Scott: Taking away our good.

833
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,497
Rym: Because he is.

834
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,260
Rym: He's super forward slicker.

835
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,340
Rym: And they're like, are you for gun control?

836
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,320
Rym: You for taking away?

837
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,659
Scott: And he says, yes, I am.

838
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,160
Scott: But then he wins them over in a totally awesome way.

839
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,620
Rym: But you might be thinking, it's not just, oh, he gives a speech and they're convinced.

840
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:23,899
Rym: No, it's so much more than that.

841
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:30,800
Rym: I can't I don't even want to hint at how he does it because it would spoil so much about what makes this comic so great.

842
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,840
Scott: The thing is, though, right, is that this guy running for president, he's pretty central character, right?

843
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,500
Scott: But he's actually not the main character.

844
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:47,340
Scott: The main character is a Japanese reporter who from a Japanese newspaper who was sent to United States to follow around the campaign.

845
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:53,320
Scott: And he's pretty much like one of the only, you know, Japanese reporters who has this level of access.

846
00:51:53,381 --> 00:51:55,600
Scott: He's basically embedded in the campaign.

847
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:03,358
Scott: He follows around this Yamaoka character who's running for president, you know, and is chronicling and reporting on everything that goes on.

848
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:07,100
Scott: And mostly you're paying attention to what his story is.

849
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,160
Scott: And of course, his story ties into Yamaoka and some other people.

850
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:29,760
Scott: And he has a love interest going on and things get sort of hairy and there's a crazy climax, you know, and you sort of get this simultaneous personal story of the main character, what his deal is and his connection, and also the story of the campaign, you know, through the primaries, through the general election.

851
00:52:29,882 --> 00:52:30,600
Scott: Oh, no spoiler.

852
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,020
Scott: Like you didn't see that coming, right?

853
00:52:32,302 --> 00:52:33,359
Scott: Who wins in the end?

854
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,040
Rym: But I mean, there's still a lot of drama.

855
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,248
Rym: I mean, obviously he's going to get to the end and then we find out, you know, does he win?

856
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:39,938
Rym: What happens?

857
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:43,740
Rym: But there is still who is going to be the vice president.

858
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:51,620
Rym: And let me tell you, a lot of people are in for the running and who actually ends up being the running mate and how that goes together.

859
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:58,160
Rym: Is more dramatic than like any action scene I've read in most comics I've ever read.

860
00:52:59,222 --> 00:53:01,580
Scott: Yeah, it's at the Democratic convention.

861
00:53:03,124 --> 00:53:09,539
Rym: This is a comic that makes the Democratic convention to determine who will be the nominee and all that business.

862
00:53:10,183 --> 00:53:12,520
Rym: Ultra dramatic and super engaging.

863
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:13,564
Rym: Oh, my God.

864
00:53:15,481 --> 00:53:19,740
Rym: Pennsylvania cast its 84 votes for Senator Yamaoka.

865
00:53:21,082 --> 00:53:22,560
Rym: Oh, what's going to happen in Texas?

866
00:53:22,985 --> 00:53:23,399
Rym: I don't know.

867
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,380
Rym: And it keeps cutting to Texas for all Noah.

868
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:25,839
Scott: Oh, shit.

869
00:53:26,524 --> 00:53:27,218
Scott: What's going to happen?

870
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,780
Scott: Yeah, no, but the here here's a quote from the back of volume three of Eagle, right?

871
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:34,427
Scott: And a lot of a lot of.

872
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:37,779
Scott: there's a lot of comparisons between these manga we've mentioned in the West Wing.

873
00:53:38,163 --> 00:53:39,920
Scott: You know, that TV show that I've never watched.

874
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:42,599
Scott: But here's a quote that I think is pretty cool.

875
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:47,720
Scott: Says I was content to get my regular political fiction fix from the West Wing.

876
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:54,160
Scott: Then I discovered Eagle James Lucas Jones of savant mag dot com.

877
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:01,160
Rym: Now, one thing, you know, we've kind of gone from the most stylized and caricatured and kind of dramaticized to the least.

878
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:10,180
Rym: I mean, this is very dramaticized, but all the politics itself, all the rules, all the inside baseball is super accurate.

879
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,897
Rym: Like this is actually incredibly, incredibly accurate as to how the U.S.

880
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:14,876
Rym: political process works.

881
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:24,239
Scott: I mean, a lot of the campaign strategies, a lot of these people who are managing these campaigns are, you know, they're based off the actual campaign managers and campaign strategists.

882
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,492
Scott: And because remember, I told you, Kaiji Kawaguchi came to the U.S.

883
00:54:27,794 --> 00:54:32,877
Scott: and spent a long time getting very close to the campaigns, studying how they work, studying U.S.

884
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:34,300
Scott: politics, seeing how things went.

885
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,720
Scott: And a lot of this campaign strategy is is pretty close to how things actually work.

886
00:54:40,221 --> 00:54:54,180
Scott: You know, and if you look at how the campaigns are being run now, you know, in the 2008 election and you read this manga, you'll see, oh, yeah, if people, you know, are thinking the way that these characters in this manga are thinking, then it totally makes sense.

887
00:54:54,240 --> 00:55:03,400
Scott: the things that are going, you know, that I see in the press, you know, and you can sort of surmise from what you see on the news, what the people were, you know, in McCain or Obama's campaigns.

888
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:11,998
Rym: You know, we're thinking when all these behind the scenes, because dramas like this do happen to a degree behind, you know, when the cameras are rolling, it's not quite.

889
00:55:12,118 --> 00:55:14,700
Scott: it doesn't have many speed lines when people aren't moving.

890
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:20,240
Rym: It depends, but it can because, I mean, our friend Barack Obama did get one kind of get.

891
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:26,400
Rym: you got point when he pulled that he bought a half hour of primetime TV on every network on the eve of the election.

892
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:27,225
Scott: Yeah, that's kind of.

893
00:55:27,245 --> 00:55:30,700
Scott: that's kind of the kind of awesome thing that happens 20 times in each of these books.

894
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,140
Rym: That's the kind of thing that happens on every page in these books.

895
00:55:33,341 --> 00:55:35,679
Rym: But here's where this is unrealistic at all.

896
00:55:37,122 --> 00:55:38,480
Rym: Everyone is awesome.

897
00:55:39,042 --> 00:55:45,599
Rym: Either they're a bad guy who's misguided, but still totally awesome, or they're a good guy who's totally awesome.

898
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,800
Rym: And everyone always does either the smart thing or the right thing or the wrong thing.

899
00:55:50,962 --> 00:55:51,778
Rym: But you know why.

900
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:52,574
Rym: And you sympathize.

901
00:55:53,120 --> 00:56:00,040
Scott: And every guy who's a bad guy, right, when actually confronted by the good guys either caves in or can't beat him.

902
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,840
Scott: So he joins them or something along those lines.

903
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,560
Scott: They're like, there are no bad guys who stay standing and unopposed.

904
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:12,800
Rym: I guess when I said that this is a very realistic, very unrealistic comic, all the details are incredibly realistic.

905
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:17,260
Rym: What is unrealistic is that there are politicians with this level of moral fiber.

906
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,940
Scott: Now, Eagle is also out of print, but you can actually get it at a lot of discount bins.

907
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,920
Scott: I've seen it on the shelves and a lot of comic book store.

908
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,500
Rym: We've acquired several copies or several sets.

909
00:56:26,601 --> 00:56:27,339
Rym: You can acquire one.

910
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,260
Scott: Now, the thing is, it was published in two different formats.

911
00:56:30,381 --> 00:56:33,560
Scott: You see, it was published in these very small trade paperbacks.

912
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,360
Scott: You know, there may be like a centimeter thick.

913
00:56:35,743 --> 00:56:37,420
Scott: And there are many, many volumes of that.

914
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:41,060
Scott: There's like 20 some odd, maybe 30 volumes of these little tiny trade paperbacks.

915
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,218
Scott: Ignore those.

916
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,059
Scott: You're never going to collect them all.

917
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:47,180
Scott: They cost way too much money unless they're in like the five cent bin.

918
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:47,780
Scott: Right.

919
00:56:48,181 --> 00:56:49,058
Scott: It's not worth it.

920
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:53,640
Scott: All of Eagle was published in five gigantic volumes.

921
00:56:54,042 --> 00:56:56,920
Scott: So the first volume doesn't actually have a number on the side.

922
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:58,160
Scott: It's just solid black.

923
00:56:58,362 --> 00:56:59,999
Scott: And it's about like an inch and a half thick.

924
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:05,000
Scott: Volumes two through five have the numbers two, three, four and five on them in a bit.

925
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,639
Scott: What single big white number?

926
00:57:06,981 --> 00:57:10,440
Scott: They're solid black on the side, and they're also like an inch and a half thick.

927
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,120
Scott: So look for big, thick black books.

928
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:17,120
Scott: And on the front covers look like newspapers that say Eagle at the top.

929
00:57:17,762 --> 00:57:18,727
Scott: And that is how you will know.

930
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,980
Scott: you have found the correct publishing of Eagle.

931
00:57:21,061 --> 00:57:22,720
Scott: And all you need is these five volumes.

932
00:57:23,102 --> 00:57:25,839
Scott: And you've got the whole thing beginning to end and you're ready to read.

933
00:57:27,065 --> 00:57:28,280
Rym: It is such a good car.

934
00:57:28,781 --> 00:57:29,279
Rym: I'm flipping.

935
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,740
Rym: I've been flipping through it this whole time.

936
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,380
Rym: Just kind of thinking about it because I haven't actually read.

937
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,999
Scott: I've got the one with the cowboy scene in a long time.

938
00:57:34,321 --> 00:57:37,759
Rym: I've got the one where there's a scene where basically he gives a speech.

939
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,180
Scott: Do you have the cake scene over there?

940
00:57:39,444 --> 00:57:40,340
Rym: I don't have the cake scene.

941
00:57:40,602 --> 00:57:41,299
Scott: I'll talk about the cakes.

942
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:42,480
Rym: OK, you can talk about the cake scene.

943
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,478
Rym: I'm going to pull up this speech.

944
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,400
Scott: So the cake scene basically check.

945
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,180
Scott: This is the kind of awesome thing that happens in Eagle.

946
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,340
Scott: Yet another example, right?

947
00:57:48,963 --> 00:57:49,980
Scott: So he's a politician.

948
00:57:50,222 --> 00:57:51,560
Scott: He's on the campaign trail.

949
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:53,860
Scott: He's basically trying to make nice with everyone.

950
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,200
Scott: He sees, you know, every stop along the road.

951
00:57:56,281 --> 00:57:58,719
Scott: You want to get everyone who gets close to you to vote for you.

952
00:57:59,221 --> 00:58:02,960
Scott: So he stops, you know, and it turns out someone messed up his schedule.

953
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,100
Scott: They screwed up, right?

954
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,520
Scott: Because you don't manage your own schedule.

955
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:10,739
Scott: Someone else manages it and takes you around and you do all these things and you just approve it and whatnot.

956
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:15,920
Scott: So they accidentally scheduling for two dinners in one night.

957
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,640
Scott: Now, a dinner is not really a big deal.

958
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,580
Scott: You go to dinner, you eat, you chit chat.

959
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,400
Scott: Maybe, you know, give a little toast, et cetera, et cetera.

960
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,160
Scott: Everyone goes, yeah, and then you get votes.

961
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:30,180
Scott: Two dinners in one night is rough because he has to eat two dinners.

962
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,760
Scott: And that's not too bad.

963
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,660
Scott: Eating two dinners is good by me, right?

964
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:38,760
Scott: I like to eat, but it's hard to put down two dinners in your stomach.

965
00:58:38,942 --> 00:58:40,159
Scott: One after the other, you might have room.

966
00:58:40,302 --> 00:58:40,918
Scott: You might barf.

967
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,060
Scott: I know I'd get really full after just one.

968
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,260
Scott: And this is like a little dinner.

969
00:58:44,482 --> 00:58:46,080
Scott: It's a big multi-course dinner.

970
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,700
Scott: You know, a fancy, you know, political fundraising type of dinner, right?

971
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:55,740
Scott: So if you don't eat the whole dinner, the people who prepared are going to be really insulted.

972
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,419
Scott: That's going to look pretty bad if you show up and you just sort of nibble on it and you don't like it.

973
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:06,880
Scott: The people are going to be like, yeah, we've made this big fancy dinner for you at our, you know, try to fundraise for us and you don't even eat it.

974
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,276
Rym: Fuck you.

975
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:15,799
Rym: The media, basically, you know, it's pretty accurate here, are always watching for any gaffe because a gaffe makes a lot more news than someone doing the right thing.

976
00:59:16,141 --> 00:59:20,960
Scott: Even if it's, I mean, look at the sort of ludicrous things that the media has paid attention to in this election.

977
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,673
Rym: You got a flag pin on.

978
00:59:23,883 --> 00:59:26,440
Scott: Did you put the wrong jersey on at the sporting event?

979
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,500
Scott: Your dog's hair is the wrong color.

980
00:59:29,161 --> 00:59:33,780
Scott: You misspoke, you know, some word, you know, someone gets started a foreign war of aggression, right?

981
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:41,999
Scott: No matter how many, no matter who you are, if you give so many speeches, you're going to mess up a word now and then it's going to happen, but the media jumps all over it.

982
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:46,120
Scott: So of course the media is going to jump all over too full to eat dinner.

983
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,859
Scott: There's a question of his health.

984
00:59:48,182 --> 00:59:50,560
Scott: Is there, you know, there's going to be all sorts of craziness.

985
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,039
Scott: So he's got to eat these two dinners.

986
00:59:53,540 --> 01:00:03,817
Scott: So miraculously, he eats the two dinners and it's like, he, when he eats the final bite of the second dinner, it's like this big glow around him and every, all the, see that most of the people don't know.

987
01:00:03,857 --> 01:00:04,799
Scott: he's eating two dinners.

988
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,100
Scott: That is the second one, you know, but all the people in his campaign are like sweating bullets.

989
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:13,019
Rym: Like it is, it is as tense as like some standoff in a gun.

990
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,675
Scott: Everyone who knows that it's his second dinner is sweating their brains off.

991
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,719
Scott: Meanwhile, he's looking cool and collected like he's supposed to.

992
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:23,516
Scott: And he puts the final bite down and they're like, oh man.

993
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:31,139
Scott: And then right as he gets up to leave, this little girl comes up to him with this piece of cake.

994
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:38,919
Scott: And I'm not going to tell you what happens then, but oh man, he's got to eat the cake, but can he eat the cake?

995
01:00:40,242 --> 01:00:41,238
Scott: Oh, I don't know.

996
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:42,598
Scott: I don't know.

997
01:00:43,403 --> 01:00:47,818
Scott: It's supposed to be a political manga, but one of the most dramatic things that happen is someone's forced to eat cake.

998
01:00:49,621 --> 01:00:55,560
Rym: But also the thing where it really gets me about this comic is that it's kind of wordy, but also the art's really good and really detailed.

999
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:07,100
Scott: There's a lot of characters, like a lot of people, you know, especially fans of, you know, superhero comics and whatever, you know, they shy away from the manga because they get that initial initial visual thing.

1000
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:11,779
Scott: You know, before anything else catches your catches you, it's always going to be the visuals, you know?

1001
01:01:12,164 --> 01:01:13,280
Scott: And I'm guilty of this too.

1002
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:25,299
Scott: If I pick up a new comic, even if that comic might be really well written or something I might care about, the visuals, you know, if the cover art or something puts me off, I'm not going to, you know, it's going to be very difficult to get me to read that or spend money on it.

1003
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:32,600
Scott: But a lot of people out there, they see a manga and they see the typical anime style, big eyes, small mouth, and they're put off for whatever reason.

1004
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:37,039
Scott: And, you know, I can understand someone being put off by that and they don't want to read it.

1005
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:37,676
Scott: They don't like it.

1006
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,740
Scott: They're sort of prejudiced towards it sometimes.

1007
01:01:40,002 --> 01:01:41,500
Scott: But, you know, there's something about that.

1008
01:01:43,021 --> 01:01:47,063
Scott: These manga, these three we have mentioned are not big eyes, small mouth art.

1009
01:01:47,561 --> 01:01:50,860
Scott: They're created, they're written and drawn by Japanese people in Japan.

1010
01:01:51,161 --> 01:01:55,800
Scott: These were published originally for Japanese audiences in the Japanese language, translated into English.

1011
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,080
Scott: Yet they are not big eyes, small mouth.

1012
01:01:59,223 --> 01:02:00,059
Scott: It's black and white.

1013
01:02:00,724 --> 01:02:01,680
Scott: Well, or monochrome.

1014
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:04,640
Scott: But it looks like normal people.

1015
01:02:05,101 --> 01:02:09,540
Scott: I mean, I guess if you looked at it, you might be able to tell that it was Japanese, you know, from the art.

1016
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:14,160
Scott: But it's not big eyes, small mouth, pointy chin, giant robot action.

1017
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:15,380
Scott: Far from it.

1018
01:02:15,521 --> 01:02:27,820
Scott: And if you're put off, you know, by the art style, the stereotypical manga anime art style, you should definitely take a look at this before you are prejudiced against it because you will be very, very surprised.

1019
01:02:27,965 --> 01:02:28,075
Rym: Yeah.

1020
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,120
Rym: I mean, like here's a dramatic scene.

1021
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,220
Rym: This is one of my favorite scenes.

1022
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:36,440
Rym: I mean, the reason I one of the reasons I really like this comic is the speeches because it's, you know, normal drama, normal drama.

1023
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:41,120
Rym: But when a politician gives a speech, you get the whole speech.

1024
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:50,580
Rym: Meanwhile, you get like all the crowd reactions, the press reactions, the reactions of people in their homes watching it on TV and the poll numbers and kind of the behind the scenes drama.

1025
01:02:50,661 --> 01:02:52,240
Rym: But you get the whole speech.

1026
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:58,160
Rym: And one of the big plot points is that there's a lot of rumbling about his kind of foreign policy and military policy.

1027
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:02,900
Rym: And a lot of people are saying he's weak and he's, you know, there's all these kind of rumors and allegations floating around.

1028
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,960
Rym: And finally, he's at a press event.

1029
01:03:05,563 --> 01:03:10,860
Rym: You know, in real politics, a lot of times reporters will appear and say, hey, we've heard blah.

1030
01:03:11,261 --> 01:03:12,299
Rym: What's your actual stance?

1031
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,620
Rym: And they always say something crap and totally dodge the issue.

1032
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:19,140
Rym: Well, the reporters corner him and they say, what's the deal?

1033
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,275
Rym: Are you disrespecting our military servicemen?

1034
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:21,880
Rym: and blah, blah, blah, blah.

1035
01:03:23,024 --> 01:03:24,238
Rym: And his response is this.

1036
01:03:25,523 --> 01:03:27,620
Rym: I want to take this opportunity to speak for the record.

1037
01:03:28,261 --> 01:03:31,040
Rym: My campaign has a long term strategy for US defense.

1038
01:03:31,842 --> 01:03:36,500
Rym: It is for this reason in particular that I'll work hard to receive two terms from the American people.

1039
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:42,060
Rym: As I anticipate, these policies will require a timeframe stretching through the first decade of the 20th century.

1040
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:47,319
Rym: For the next eight years, I will order that all US bases abroad be shut down.

1041
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:48,319
Scott: Oh, snaps.

1042
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:50,019
Rym: And this speech goes out.

1043
01:03:50,281 --> 01:03:51,580
Scott: That's something I would do if I was president.

1044
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:52,880
Rym: That happens all the time.

1045
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:58,900
Rym: He says this and the next like eight panels, at first it shows the reporters like a GOG.

1046
01:03:59,421 --> 01:04:02,860
Rym: It cuts to his campaign manager going, did he just say?

1047
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:06,980
Rym: And his other campaign manager is like sweating, going off shit behind him.

1048
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,739
Rym: It cuts to all these military people.

1049
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,040
Rym: What out of his fucking mind?

1050
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,439
Rym: That traitor bastard.

1051
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,900
Scott: See, it's like someone said something ludicrous, right?

1052
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:19,520
Scott: And that's the sort of thing that in the real world, you just basically ruined yourself.

1053
01:04:20,042 --> 01:04:23,080
Scott: And of course, everyone acts as if he ruined himself.

1054
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,740
Scott: It's it's the reactions are real.

1055
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:33,260
Rym: It's the Bulworth second and parallel to this order, unless the lives of American citizens and the territory of the United States is itself under threat.

1056
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:38,720
Rym: It will be the policy of my administration to forgo any future military action.

1057
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:45,480
Scott: Do you see how that plays into the whole, you know, Japanese ideology with the, you know, the Article nine and whatnot?

1058
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:49,540
Rym: Now, this is when it cuts to a bunch of officers at a club somewhere.

1059
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:55,920
Rym: And his a guy who he wants to be his advisors at this club and forgo military action.

1060
01:04:56,301 --> 01:04:58,499
Rym: Asshole sounds like he's running for the president of Iraq.

1061
01:04:58,947 --> 01:04:59,700
Rym: That bastard.

1062
01:05:00,281 --> 01:05:00,978
Rym: He wants to get rid of us.

1063
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:01,880
Rym: Jesus Christ.

1064
01:05:02,241 --> 01:05:03,359
Rym: General, you were right about him.

1065
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,549
Rym: And he was in the core.

1066
01:05:04,812 --> 01:05:05,620
Rym: traitor, traitor.

1067
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,740
Rym: And like people are just losing their shit.

1068
01:05:08,462 --> 01:05:09,800
Rym: And then, you know, it goes on for a while.

1069
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:16,000
Rym: And then later, the Republican candidate gives a speech that's basically rah, rah, rah, military.

1070
01:05:16,682 --> 01:05:19,320
Rym: And everyone's thinking that the whole campaign has fallen apart.

1071
01:05:19,743 --> 01:05:21,520
Rym: And oh, my God, he's totally going to lose.

1072
01:05:21,822 --> 01:05:22,960
Rym: He's lost the American people.

1073
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:23,740
Rym: He's lost the military.

1074
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,237
Rym: It's over.

1075
01:05:25,102 --> 01:05:30,680
Rym: And then there's this scene where that military advisor is meeting with all these big military people and they confront him.

1076
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,300
Rym: They're like, do you really follow on with what that guy says?

1077
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:35,119
Rym: Are you with him?

1078
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:35,554
Rym: Really?

1079
01:05:36,163 --> 01:05:36,680
Rym: Blah, blah, blah.

1080
01:05:37,081 --> 01:05:43,359
Rym: And he just said he looks at him and he says, if you die for a meaningless war, you died a meaningless death.

1081
01:05:44,184 --> 01:05:45,640
Rym: And they stand up like they're about to hit him.

1082
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,639
Rym: And he says, I said, a meaningless death.

1083
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:50,520
Rym: And that is the drama that you get in Eagle.

1084
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:54,680
Rym: And that that whole thing is like one out of a thousand.

1085
01:05:54,882 --> 01:05:56,739
Rym: And that is actually one of the weaker ones.

1086
01:05:58,005 --> 01:05:59,240
Rym: This comic is so great.

1087
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:02,080
Scott: Yeah, that's a that's a good mention there.

1088
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,580
Scott: The Bulworth, though, if that's your kind of movie, these are your kind of manga.

1089
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:10,938
Rym: And if these are your kind of manga, Bulworth is your kind of movie, even though, man, is that a depressing movie?

1090
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,160
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty depressing.

1091
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:21,819
Scott: You know, and I think even though all these these manga here will have you wishing that, you know, any of these fictional characters are the candidates instead of the real ones.

1092
01:06:22,442 --> 01:06:24,599
Rym: I would have voted for the Republican in this book.

1093
01:06:25,421 --> 01:06:27,880
Scott: Yeah, I would have fun the Republican in this book before Obama.

1094
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,397
Scott: Hells yeah.

1095
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,460
Scott: But no, it's it's not going to happen.

1096
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:32,423
Scott: And that's the most.

1097
01:06:32,564 --> 01:06:45,700
Scott: that's why even though these are really inspirational and will have you, you know, jumping up and down and cheering and every and such and such in the end, they are depressing because you realize that this is what politics, at least in theory, could.

1098
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:50,099
Scott: well, maybe not could, but what should be in a perfect world and it never will be.

1099
01:06:50,582 --> 01:06:53,140
Scott: And that's why it's sort of it's sort of sad at the same time.

1100
01:06:53,220 --> 01:07:07,620
Rym: Isn't it always kind of the cliche that I mean, how many movies do we have where the guy who doesn't care and doesn't expect to win and doesn't want to win, runs his campaign stupidly and haphazardly and as a result wins, because that's what the people really want.

1101
01:07:08,143 --> 01:07:10,120
Rym: And that's such a cliche.

1102
01:07:10,582 --> 01:07:14,278
Rym: But yet we've never seen a major political candidate do it.

1103
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:21,679
Rym: No, I guess the thing is, one person did actually Ross Perot and he got real close, closer than anyone ever had.

1104
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:28,140
Scott: I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about what the what's and whys and wherefores of Ross Perot and his gigantic, gigantic ears.

1105
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,480
Rym: Well, I guess I can say this, though.

1106
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,640
Rym: I think I want to say here's my political bit here.

1107
01:07:32,062 --> 01:07:35,900
Rym: I think the reason for that is Ross Perot was the least insane.

1108
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:52,839
Rym: He was pretty much the least insane non-primary party person to ever, at least in history that anyone out there remembers, really to get on the national stage and get noticed for speaking his mind, because a lot of people, there are a lot of politicians who run for high office, who speak their mind.

1109
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,779
Rym: But usually it's because they're crazy.

1110
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,300
Rym: I mean, Ron Paul is crazy and his politics are stupid.

1111
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,460
Rym: I'm sorry, Dig, but you're wrong.

1112
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,539
Scott: Bob Barr, also crazy.

1113
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:08,195
Scott: Pretty much every constitution party, 10,000 times crazy.

1114
01:08:09,641 --> 01:08:12,000
Scott: And that's not even one of the crazier parties out there.

1115
01:08:12,161 --> 01:08:12,880
Rym: I got to say one more thing.

1116
01:08:13,581 --> 01:08:19,279
Rym: You know how many people Ellery slaps or beats up or freaks out at in this book?

1117
01:08:20,187 --> 01:08:21,779
Rym: She is basically a tank.

1118
01:08:22,542 --> 01:08:23,339
Scott: Yeah, it's great.

1119
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:24,220
Scott: It's super great.

1120
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,997
Rym: She kind of reminds me of Bulma from Dragon Paul, just a little bit.

1121
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:33,379
Scott: But basically, you know, everyone who runs for office in the US who isn't one of the two major parties is crazy.

1122
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:35,819
Scott: And even sometimes the two major party people are crazy.

1123
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:39,399
Scott: So, you know, we usually end up voting for the sane person.

1124
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:45,120
Scott: And the thing is, Ross Perot was sane and there were two other sane candidates against him with three not crazy candidates.

1125
01:08:45,301 --> 01:08:54,620
Scott: And what happened was is the things that Ross Perot was saying that were so universally appealing, they were so agreeable, which is why he got so popular.

1126
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,000
Scott: He said things like balance the fucking budget.

1127
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:57,225
Scott: Duh.

1128
01:08:57,761 --> 01:08:58,899
Scott: And everyone was like, of course.

1129
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,439
Scott: Well, I mean, no one disagree.

1130
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:04,800
Rym: No one's saying that he had other policies that were crazy, but no one listened to those.

1131
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:05,231
Rym: Right.

1132
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:11,080
Scott: But he had a but his primary policies, his major ones were agreeable across the board.

1133
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:15,100
Scott: So what happened was the Democrats, you know, Bill Clinton just said, I'll do that.

1134
01:09:16,246 --> 01:09:17,120
Scott: And it was a Bob Dole.

1135
01:09:17,961 --> 01:09:20,759
Scott: I think, yeah, Bob Dole said, yeah, I'll do that, too.

1136
01:09:21,401 --> 01:09:33,420
Scott: So there was no reason to vote for Ross Perot, because if you voted for one of the other guys, you got all the other issues that you actually agreed with and you got everything that Ross Perot said.

1137
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,840
Scott: And that's what happens when there's a third party in the US.

1138
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:46,100
Scott: The third party either displaces one of the two parties by taking over for it or its policies get adopted by the two major parties.

1139
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:53,558
Scott: And now there's no reason to vote for that third party because it was a single issue party, something like the Green Party, which is a heavy emphasis on environmentalism and whatnot.

1140
01:09:54,160 --> 01:10:01,680
Scott: Both of the major parties, even though they differ on the specifics, they have both, at least in their campaign, said stuff like, you know, good for the environment.

1141
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:03,639
Scott: Yeah, because it's so popular.

1142
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:04,619
Scott: Wait a minute.

1143
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:06,339
Scott: You're talking about politics.

1144
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:07,600
Scott: Yeah.

1145
01:10:08,623 --> 01:10:10,180
Scott: I'm not talking about any specific stuff here.

1146
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:10,996
Rym: Yes, you are.

1147
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:12,100
Scott: Whatever.

1148
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:18,220
Scott: You know, so that's that's what happened is the Green Party's policies have been adopted by the two major parties.

1149
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:25,617
Scott: So there's no reason to vote for the Green Party, really, because you can just vote for one of the other parties and you're going to get some of your environmental goodness that you're looking for.

1150
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:43,320
Scott: So, yeah, that's you know, and that's sort of why these manga are somewhat unrealistic is that if candidates like these came around with these sort of policies, they would either be crazy and no one would vote for them and they would be cast off or their policies would be agreeable to everyone.

1151
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:48,579
Scott: And one of the other candidates would adopt those policies and there would be no reason to vote for the awesome person.

1152
01:10:49,721 --> 01:10:56,159
Scott: But if you're looking for a political inspiration of awesomeness, these books, you should try to find them in the bargain bins.

1153
01:10:56,723 --> 01:10:58,600
Rym: And I think on that note, we can wrap this up.

1154
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:03,619
Rym: So I hope we have opened your eyes to three comics, two of which you'll probably never be able to read.

1155
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:05,620
Scott: Well, you know, try hard.

1156
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,360
Scott: Don't go out of your way to look for them.

1157
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:10,580
Scott: You know, maybe eBay is worth looking at or Amazon or, you know, once in a while.

1158
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:26,780
Scott: But whenever you happen to be at a convention, happen to be at a comic book store, look in the bargain bins, look in the, you know, discount manga, old manga, whatever, whatever, and see if you can find first president of Japan, Sanctuary or Eagle.

1159
01:11:27,184 --> 01:11:28,540
Scott: And if you do, just buy them.

1160
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:29,619
Scott: Don't even think about it.

1161
01:11:29,902 --> 01:11:32,019
Scott: You know, at the very least, buy them.

1162
01:11:32,241 --> 01:11:39,780
Scott: And then if you don't like the mail them to us, because I'll take as many copies of these as I can get just so I can, you know, make sure they find good homes.

1163
01:11:46,451 --> 01:11:48,530
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1164
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:51,170

1168

1177
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:01,870
