00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,132
Rym: It's Wednesday November 21st.

2
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:13,116
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:16,828
Rym: I'm Scott And this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:18,392
Rym: We finally do it.

5
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:20,800
Rym: we discuss hentai.

6
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:25,378
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:39,829
Scott: so I've been riding the train to the city for many moons now and the day before Thanksgiving is Consistently the most busy train day of the year.

8
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:42,197
Scott: They don't put out any extra trains for some reason.

9
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:43,280
Scott: Yeah, they do do they?

10
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,080
Rym: Yeah, there were like four extra trains.

11
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:58,180
Scott: I didn't notice any extra trains, but even if they were the trains going to the city On this day are always really empty because no one goes to work or at least a lot less people go to work.

12
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,574
Scott: But the trains coming home are packed to the brim standing room only.

13
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:03,777
Scott: it's crazy now.

14
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:09,000
Rym: Scott warned me I didn't even think about this because I hadn't been working down in the proper part of the city.

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,469
Rym: I've been working up in the Bronx, so I'm thinking you I'm gonna get my 410 train home and Scott's like yeah I'm getting on the three something.

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,600
Rym: Oh my god the craziness.

17
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:18,390
Rym: So I walk down.

18
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:25,500
Rym: It's about 406 it's about 405 and I walk into Grand Central.

19
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:34,591
Rym: I see my 410 train and then I see about to leave a 405 train that goes to one place beacon.

20
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:36,938
Rym: Oh, yeah, well and Poughkeepsie, but that's past beacon.

21
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:37,660
Rym: so it doesn't exist.

22
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,060
Scott: It also goes to New Hamburg which is in between, but that doesn't matter Hamburg exists even less.

23
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:42,683
Scott: I know.

24
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:47,718
Rym: I went there once when a friend of ours visiting us missed the stop And I had to drive to New Hamburg and pick him up.

25
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:53,659
Rym: But yeah, I get on this train and like Scott said it's standing room only.

26
00:01:53,679 --> 00:02:00,360
Rym: yep I was not lying until I realized that no it wasn't standing room only in the three across seats.

27
00:02:00,783 --> 00:02:02,637
Rym: Almost every one of them had no one sitting in the middle.

28
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:11,014
Scott: well You gotta understand that the way the train is laid out at the ends of the train cars There are these four-seaters with this two seats facing two seats and you can fit two people there.

29
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:11,818
Rym: if you're lucky.

30
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:17,239
Scott: those things are God-awful, it's mostly because any you know as long as it's for children You can fit like six children there.

31
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:23,258
Scott: But because your knees are gonna You're basically if two people sit across from each other your knees at the other person's knees.

32
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:25,889
Rym: now remember This is only on the old crappy cars.

33
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:29,824
Rym: if you take the nice new electric cars that only go to Croton Harman It's not a problem.

34
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:35,885
Scott: the problem is we live so far away from the city that we have to use a diesel train which has Different train passenger cars.

35
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:47,780
Scott: the electric trains have very nice better passenger cars that are superior in every way But anyway, but they want to extend them electric Other than the four-seaters where it's two seats facing two seats.

36
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:56,493
Scott: There the others the all the other seats are One half of the train is three-seaters And then there's an aisle to walk down and the other half of the train is two-seaters.

37
00:02:56,554 --> 00:03:05,280
Scott: now for some reason people have no Problem sitting two people and the two-seaters, but in the three-seaters People don't like to sit three people in the three-seater.

38
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,660
Scott: They only like to sit one person in one seat one person in the other and then one nothing in the middle.

39
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:11,272
Scott: They don't like anyone sitting in the middle.

40
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:19,952
Rym: rule on any New York City transit is that if there's a seat you have to make it available and you cannot take up more than one seat no matter what.

41
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:25,980
Rym: yes, so I Well, I've never had to stand on a train because there's always a seat somewhere.

42
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:38,501
Scott: The last time I was on the last time I took the train the day before Thanksgiving the entire train Every two-seater had two people and every seat three-seater had three people and every four-seater had four people and people were standing in the Isles.

43
00:03:38,682 --> 00:03:44,139
Rym: so today ever like there's hundreds of people to stand and ever in the aisles in the vestibules And I look and there's a bunch of seats.

44
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:48,780
Rym: So I just walk up to a random spot, and I say excuse me is anyone sitting in the middle there?

45
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:52,947
Rym: And the guy looks horrified Absolutely horrified.

46
00:03:52,988 --> 00:04:08,580
Rym: II he got a mumble something to me Nicely dressed guy and the guy sitting there's on the other end is just kind of quiet and he kind of gets up to let me in and I sit down in the middle and Then he walks away and stands for the whole hour ride home, and I got the seat to myself.

47
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:10,415
Scott: All right.

48
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:13,140
Rym: Then everyone else is just standing there.

49
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,396
Rym: There's plenty of seats But no one would just ask if they could sit in the middle which they are allowed to.

50
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:21,975
Rym: everyone's just so afraid of Touching another person or talk to another person.

51
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:22,780
Rym: It's kind of scary.

52
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:27,240
Scott: Yeah, I have no problem asking to sit in the middle or anything like that.

53
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,344
Scott: I just if I if there's a seat I'm gonna take it.

54
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:35,146
Scott: the problem was last time the train was so crowded there was no seat But I guess this time on the train I was riding today.

55
00:04:35,226 --> 00:04:40,134
Scott: many of the three-seaters were had three people But there were a few that only had two and there are plenty of people standing.

56
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:44,235
Rym: so but anyway I figure we should get right into it because I don't have a news.

57
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:48,739
Rym: We've been trying to Shall we say avoid the anime news now?

58
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:55,415
Scott: Is that in America in the United States where anime is imported and not something we make so much?

59
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,300
Scott: it's very anime news.

60
00:04:58,205 --> 00:05:00,700
Scott: Anime news network is pretty much as a monopoly in anime news.

61
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,980
Scott: It's not like they control the anime news and don't let anyone else report on it.

62
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,315
Scott: It's just that they report on all of it and no one else really does.

63
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:13,410
Rym: so they're basically The AP wire for anime and that the anime is something.

64
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,097
Rym: wire and then awesome anime world order and everyone.

65
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:19,239
Rym: we pretty much just Look through there for the news.

66
00:05:19,842 --> 00:05:31,586
Scott: Yeah, so we're trying to avoid doing an anime news so much because you know There really isn't that much anime news right now and anime news network is the only place it comes from and you can read anime News network, you don't need to listen to us.

67
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:34,136
Scott: So unless you have an interesting commentary on the news.

68
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:35,060
Scott: What's the point?

69
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,371
Rym: Well, there was the odex news, but I don't really care.

70
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:40,980
Rym: Anyway, we got a geek back here.

71
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:54,390
Rym: It's kind of long, but I'm gonna read it and I think I believe that What I'm going to respond is going to be kind of self-evident by the end of it and we've had an ongoing Conversation with this gentleman for the last few hours.

72
00:05:54,932 --> 00:05:56,717
Rym: So this is from Ray Moo.

73
00:05:56,737 --> 00:06:04,000
Rym: I Just listened to your 10-7-7 show where you discussed shounen fighting anime and I must say I'm disappointed.

74
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:07,740
Rym: Your argument was not very well thought out or coherent.

75
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:14,559
Rym: The first point you raised was that you dislike the use of deus ex machina plot devices to revolt resolve conflicts in the show.

76
00:06:15,222 --> 00:06:19,840
Rym: However, this is a criticism of the show's writing and not of the genre itself.

77
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:25,480
Rym: Not only that but there is nothing inherently wrong with that mechanic either.

78
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:32,007
Rym: Look no further than Gurren Langan just a lagann Example of where it is used to great effect.

79
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:36,259
Rym: after that you expressed dismay for long drawn-out fight scenes.

80
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,072
Rym: yet Once again, there is nothing wrong with this mechanic.

81
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:43,339
Rym: Another contemporary example is Akaki.

82
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:57,171
Rym: Let me finish reading his email before I get to that which is you which uses this technique masterfully At the masterfully and I could hear two words.

83
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:57,894
Scott: I would not but anyone.

84
00:06:57,914 --> 00:07:03,240
Rym: there are multiple Episodes that encompass the single a single round of mahjong.

85
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:08,440
Rym: Wow, okay.

86
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:22,630
Rym: Yet the show Creates an insanely tense atmosphere that has you on the edge of your seat the whole time because you're waiting like an hour for something to happen and holding your breath with each draw of a tile.

87
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:31,660
Rym: the pacing also allows time to digest the complex Involved in mahjong and fully appreciate what's going on?

88
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,606
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's ultimately.

89
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:40,208
Rym: your critique of shounen fighting genre is that you don't like bad writing and for execution.

90
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:41,380
Rym: did it editing.

91
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,019
Rym: Apparently we don't like bad writing in for execution, huh?

92
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,429
Scott: Apparently this is thanks for telling me what I don't like.

93
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:53,660
Rym: This is hardly revelation and hardly a critique exclusive to the genre.

94
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:54,489
Rym: I never said that.

95
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,727
Rym: I Never said that at all.

96
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,169
Rym: There's some other anime that is Poorly executed and written badly.

97
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:03,800
Scott: Oh, I can aim a whole bunch.

98
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:05,925
Rym: On a final note.

99
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:12,588
Rym: I feel like if you don't have the time to give an anime a fair shake Then you aren't qualified to discuss it.

100
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:16,239
Rym: There's nothing wrong with skipping episodes in certain cases either.

101
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:23,386
Rym: now I responded that last thing first because Dave from fast karate for the gentleman brought this up I think fairly succinctly.

102
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:31,940
Scott: they also did a whole show, you know talking about what reviewing means and I think This emailer here would do do well to listen to that episode of fast karate.

103
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:35,940
Rym: If you don't have time to give an anime a fair shake, what does it entail?

104
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:41,460
Rym: I mean if I watch the first I don't know 14 episodes of a show and it's not good.

105
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:44,832
Rym: I think it's fair to say that the show is not good.

106
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:49,359
Rym: Now if the show gets better 14 episodes in Well, something's wrong.

107
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,973
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you have something that's all good.

108
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:54,540
Scott: That's part good and part bad.

109
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:56,994
Scott: You kind of have to sum up the whole thing.

110
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:58,060
Scott: It's only half good.

111
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:00,429
Scott: There are things in the world that are all good.

112
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,160
Scott: Those things are better than the thing that is half good.

113
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:10,299
Rym: That I mean, I'll put it this way Gasaraki is a great show, but it is kind of a slow show.

114
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:19,758
Rym: I would say that the pacing of gasaraki and the Investment build-up for payoff that is the line as far as I can go.

115
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:25,094
Rym: anything That's slower than that or has less payoff than that or just is.

116
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:26,599
Rym: ah, I couldn't deal with it.

117
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,060
Rym: That is it.

118
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,931
Rym: I barely watched gasaraki and while it was worth it.

119
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:31,778
Rym: I was barely worth it.

120
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:38,748
Rym: Anyway in regards to Akagi I don't know if you've played mahjong.

121
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:47,313
Rym: I don't know if you got everything, you know about mahjong from that anime, but Mahjong is basically a glorified game of chance.

122
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:48,857
Rym: It's kind of like poker.

123
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:49,800
Scott: It's really.

124
00:09:50,420 --> 00:10:00,020
Scott: Mahjong is basically the same game Effectively the same game as gin rummy only with tiles instead of cards and different odds and slightly more free rules.

125
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:11,012
Scott: I've played and know how to play both the original Chinese mahjong at least how it is played these days and old Jewish lady mahjong, which is a sort of a bastardization of the game.

126
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:15,940
Scott: that is the way Jewish ladies like to play it and both of those games are.

127
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:20,760
Scott: You have to learn some basic strategy in order to be able to play the game.

128
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:25,820
Scott: But once you've mastered that strategy, which is simple the game comes down to randomness.

129
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,370
Scott: You might as well if you have the same.

130
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:34,100
Scott: if you and someone else both know You know how to play the game well enough you might as well just roll a d6 and see who wins.

131
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:42,414
Rym: See at least in poker like Texas hold 'em while the game is mostly random It comes down to how well you play your opponents.

132
00:10:43,157 --> 00:10:46,327
Rym: in mahjong There's no playing your opponents.

133
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:47,512
Rym: That's not gonna happen.

134
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:49,400
Rym: I guess unless your opponents are stupid.

135
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:50,124
Scott: but yeah, it's just.

136
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:58,900
Scott: it comes down to your ability to remember what tiles have been thrown and What tiles your opponents likely have and likely want and don't give them those tiles?

137
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:11,958
Scott: I mean, you know sure there might be some psychology and you know someone might throw out a tile that might make you think You know that you know you they need this tile or that tile, but that's like such the you know,

138
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:12,640
Rym: so

139
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:23,890
Scott: Not even counting as a factor compared to just remembering what tiles have been out there and what tiles people have taken which matters So much more it doesn't even come into it

140
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:31,226
Rym: now in regards to saying that Akagi uses this technique Masterfully Akagi was boring as shit.

141
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:31,929
Rym: It was.

142
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,435
Rym: it was awful.

143
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:36,945
Scott: Don't watch Akagi I'll use a terrible show.

144
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:38,511
Scott: I watched like a few episodes of it.

145
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:51,804
Scott: the art and character design was you know It's stylistic and different for most other things you're gonna watch but it's also ugly unpleasant to look at and terrible the characters who are Simplistic and cliched.

146
00:11:52,125 --> 00:12:01,436
Scott: the plot was you know, if you're gonna look for to compare Akagi to anything You got to compare it to hakara no go and hakara no go is a million times better than Akagi.

147
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:04,250
Scott: So What else you want me to say?

148
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,540
Scott: I don't know.

149
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,220
Rym: I mean we kept discussing with this kid and he won't let it go at least to his credit.

150
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,048
Rym: He writes fairly well, but he isn't really.

151
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:13,372
Rym: I don't know.

152
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:15,337
Rym: I don't really see anything I can argue with.

153
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:18,040
Rym: I mean Deus Ex Machina is good.

154
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,845
Rym: No Deus Ex Machina bad.

155
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:25,446
Rym: that means you didn't write well and didn't have any good foreshadowing or You're just making it up as you go.

156
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:27,393
Rym: And maybe it's not gonna be consistent in the long run.

157
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:29,159
Rym: It's usually a cheap way out.

158
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:33,800
Scott: Yeah, I can't think of any examples of a Deus Ex Machina that I can say.

159
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,220
Scott: I mean you might have something that's entertaining with a Deus Ex Machina.

160
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:45,040
Scott: Or if you have a really subtle Deus Ex Machina that doesn't seem too out there, you know It could somehow make sense within the setting then it won't be too bad.

161
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,866
Scott: But you don't really.

162
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:57,799
Scott: you know, if you don't go to writers class and they say yes Deus Ex Machina That is a sign of good writing that you won't say see anyone say that plus saying that it's a criticism of a show's writing And not the genre itself.

163
00:12:58,781 --> 00:13:07,835
Scott: Almost every Shonen fighting show I've ever seen pulls the Deus Ex Machina Regularly and I would I would go so far as to say is that the plot structure.

164
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:21,713
Scott: if you were to write something Anything even if you were the bet even if you're Alan Moore, right a great writer If you were to write something with the plot structure required for it to be in the genre of Shonen fighting It is automatically bad writing

165
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:22,619
Rym: because remember

166
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:26,230
Scott: Unless you're doing a parody of a show to fighting to

167
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:38,243
Rym: show like initial D or even Akagi I'll give Akagi this credit if it's a real thing Then the audience can have realistic expectations about it and therefore there's a lot of implied Foreshadowing.

168
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:42,220
Rym: in a show like Naruto where they just make it up completely.

169
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:49,760
Rym: It's like we make up a technique But then we make up the way to beat it and then we make up the shadow technique that beats that technique.

170
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,259
Rym: That's very often not going to end with a good story.

171
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:56,271
Scott: No, not really.

172
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:59,471
Scott: Oh You done with the I'm done.

173
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,280
Rym: I could just I mean he goes on to.

174
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,137
Rym: Scott basically responded to him and said Akagi is the worst show I've ever seen.

175
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:05,840
Scott: It's not the worst show.

176
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,723
Scott: It's one of the worst though.

177
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:10,635
Rym: Well, it's one of the worst that we actually watched more than I don't know.

178
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:12,140
Rym: five minutes of that's true.

179
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:13,312
Rym: We gave it a chance.

180
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:20,360
Rym: I'll give it bad Yeah But the fact that we gave it a chance and that it ended up being so bad it I think that show really does suck.

181
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:26,947
Rym: I really do I defy anyone to like that show other than this guy Someone who's like crazy about mahjong.

182
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:30,380
Scott: and actually there's a game of strategy instead of luck to any of you like it.

183
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:38,689
Rym: We played mahjong for like a year and a half at RIT and then one day We're all sitting there and we're like, wait a minute Isn't this game just random?

184
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:39,979
Rym: Yeah, it is just random.

185
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:43,134
Rym: Wow This game is really kind of random and crap and we never played it again.

186
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:43,777
Rym: Not once.

187
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:49,282
Scott: Nope Alright, so I have a tiny news which wasn't on my news network and that is you know It's the.

188
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,072
Scott: it's the week of buying shit in the u.s.

189
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:52,580
Scott: Here's there's a lot of buying going on.

190
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,673
Scott: So what are the anime companies putting out for you to buy?

191
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:58,918
Scott: because you know if they want to make mad moneys They're gonna put out good stuff this week, right?

192
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:01,974
Scott: They put out Death Note DVD number one.

193
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:04,265
Scott: Oh Snap that that.

194
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:05,128
Scott: what else can I say?

195
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:09,842
Scott: if you're a lot of people are into that it's good Buy it.

196
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:16,280
Rym: You know what holiday present if I hadn't read Death Note that that would be like the best anime I'd ever seen.

197
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:18,447
Scott: Yeah, probably but I read it.

198
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:22,440
Rym: So but even though I've read it I plan to watch a few choice episodes.

199
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:35,379
Scott: Oh on an unrelated note if you want Death Note volume 13 how to read sort of the supplementary appendix volume of Death Note that comes that sort of like explains stuff but is not actually part of the story.

200
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:43,261
Scott: you Can pre-order it this month for and it will ship two months from now in January Okay.

201
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:46,096
Scott: Now in addition to that I'm gonna do a geek bite.

202
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:49,200
Scott: you see I Think I've talked about this for a while.

203
00:15:49,260 --> 00:16:08,628
Scott: But I pre-order the comics and they come in the mail and whatever and you know, I pre-order everything I know I'm gonna want and then sometimes I pre-order some stuff on a whim or I pre-order some stuff based on the description Or I pre-order some stuff by a writer I know but I'm not sure if this is actually good or not, you know, or I pre-order something that sounds good I don't know or something someone recommends whatever

204
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:09,431
Rym: and

205
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,382
Scott: most of the time when I pure to stuff like that I go Oh Disappointment.

206
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,171
Scott: This was why did I order this?

207
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:15,834
Scott: I don't even know.

208
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:16,960
Scott: it's not so good, right?

209
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:26,660
Scott: But in the latest giant box of comics there were a couple things that I ordered You know just on a whim and they were pretty awesome and I was like whoo lucky me.

210
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:36,768
Scott: so One thing I read was basically this book called dungeon, right and it's by John I'm not I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing the person's name, right?

211
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:42,427
Scott: It's John's far which is the person who wrote rabbi's cat and Klezmer and you know the.

212
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:48,300
Scott: they write a lot of good stuff mostly Jewish stuff But dungeon is not Jewish in any way whatsoever.

213
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:54,540
Scott: It is literally a story about a dungeon and I you know that alone made me think huh?

214
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:04,419
Scott: This might be cool and I got it and it is hilarious in that sort of Hagar the horrible but more intelligent kind of way.

215
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:14,859
Scott: Aha, it's like a bunch of lovable characters in a dungeon and funny stuff happens in the dungeon And it really kind of makes me want to play dungeon keeper even though I never played dungeon keeper.

216
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:21,778
Scott: I know what it's about though and then I realized a new dungeon keeper 3 never came out and maybe someone should make a dude dungeon keeper game.

217
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:30,623
Scott: and yeah, if you like Dungeons and monsters and magic and that sort of stuff and dungeons There's a bunch.

218
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:34,520
Scott: I think there's like six volumes of dungeon and one or two volumes of dungeon parade.

219
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:42,194
Scott: I read the first volume of dungeon and the first volume of dungeon parade Which is actually the correct order to read them in and I was not disappointed.

220
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:43,760
Scott: I was in fact pleasantly surprised.

221
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:50,120
Rym: Huh funny you mentioned that because uh, it seems like we might be talking a little bit about dungeons in the second half of the show.

222
00:17:51,336 --> 00:18:00,120
Scott: so The other book I got was I think it's James Sturm's America God gold and golems and it looked kind of cool.

223
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:05,097
Scott: You know, I like Americana kind of stuff and it was a comic and it was kind of highbrow looking.

224
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:17,179
Scott: so I got it and it's three stories and the first story is about God and the second story is about gold and the third story is about Golems and the golem store is the best because it's about Jews playing baseball.

225
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:20,947
Rym: Make a golem to play baseball.

226
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:22,070
Scott: No, it's better than that.

227
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:25,360
Rym: They make a golem to kill the other team while playing baseball.

228
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:25,883
Scott: No, it's.

229
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:26,587
Scott: it's very.

230
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,276
Scott: it's very poignant and American.

231
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:29,542
Scott: It's sort of like.

232
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:35,038
Scott: the first one takes place in like 1801 and the second story takes place during like, you know Gold rush, huh?

233
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,188
Scott: and the third story takes place in like the 20s and it's.

234
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:43,664
Scott: it's actually very kind of serious and and meaningful and and It's good stuff.

235
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:49,744
Scott: Wow, and you should you should get it if you like Americana or and Comics.

236
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:50,612
Rym: All right.

237
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:51,520
Rym: one last thing.

238
00:18:51,601 --> 00:19:03,520
Rym: I know I've been mentioning this every week but I feel like I should and I will give all the details before it actually happens, but December 7th 8th 9th, New York City, Jacob Javits Center the New York Anime Festival.

239
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:05,439
Rym: We are going to be guests there.

240
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:07,087
Rym: we're doing a whole bunch of events.

241
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:21,596
Rym: want to see our match game want to see our Somewhat infamous gecky got panel only this time without the without the infamy without the stylings of one Gerald Rathcald Who may if we can convince him return to do it with us at katsuka.

242
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:22,520
Scott: I don't think he's gonna.

243
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:27,740
Scott: If he doesn't I'm saying he will to sort of apply pressure just in case.

244
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,970
Rym: Well, if he doesn't I'm gonna see if he'll give me half.

245
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,511
Scott: No way.

246
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:32,655
Scott: He promised he promised.

247
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:33,277
Scott: now he has to go.

248
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:38,176
Rym: Yeah This just in Gerald Rathcald is coming to katsuka.

249
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:38,598
Scott: Yeah.

250
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,420
Rym: No But maybe I can convince him to give me half of his visual aids.

251
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:46,480
Rym: I hope you understand which half I want and which half I don't.

252
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,523
Scott: Yeah, but the kind that won't get us in trouble because our panel is not 18 plus.

253
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:55,506
Scott: it is all ages now.

254
00:19:55,586 --> 00:19:57,130
Rym: So well the pebble depends.

255
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:57,973
Rym: the panel at New York.

256
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:00,280
Rym: is it three o'clock on Friday?

257
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,504
Rym: Yes, it is pg-13.

258
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:02,729
Rym: Uh-huh.

259
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,504
Rym: We can trade into our territory a little bit All right now.

260
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,893
Rym: the one at Katsucon we were gonna go.

261
00:20:08,913 --> 00:20:19,700
Rym: pg-13 are but multiple independent members of the Katsucon staff have been periodically Emailing me and saying so you get a show that thing you showed at the end of the last one again.

262
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:27,438
Rym: Oh my god, that was the funniest thing ever to which I say No, probably not.

263
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:31,516
Scott: Anyway, whether the New York and a festival is good or bad because we have no idea.

264
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:32,440
Scott: It's a brand new Khan.

265
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:34,317
Scott: That's totally up in the air.

266
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,713
Scott: though I can say there's good things going for it and bad things going for it.

267
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:39,340
Scott: the parts we do will be good.

268
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:40,274
Scott: You know that for sure.

269
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:48,980
Rym: plus I mean it's being run by people who did the New York comic-con and they seem to know how it works And they seem to be running it pretty intelligent.

270
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,800
Scott: It's the same company, but the guy running the Khan itself the employee of that company seems to he knows what's up.

271
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:57,399
Rym: He really does seem to know what's up and he's trying real hard.

272
00:20:57,601 --> 00:20:59,630
Rym: So we're gonna have an alley table.

273
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:07,239
Rym: anyone who goes you're going to see early sketch art of our swag in addition to basically all the previews of our swag.

274
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,073
Rym: and Even though we may not have all the actual swag there in time.

275
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:21,160
Rym: We're probably Possibly maybe going to be able to take preliminary pre-orders Prolet pre pre-orders free pre-orders first way.

276
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,169
Rym: I imagine if we do pre pre-orders how that'll work is.

277
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,720
Rym: if you commit to getting it you'll get a discount when it comes out.

278
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:33,434
Rym: Uh-huh, yeah, but seriously, we've got an artist working on some t-shirt designs.

279
00:21:33,996 --> 00:21:35,780
Rym: They are of the highest quality.

280
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:38,451
Scott: Yeah, we just it's gonna take a while.

281
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:39,517
Rym: Well, it's hard.

282
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:43,534
Rym: I can make generic t-shirts and I'm thinking of making coffee mugs and all that stuff.

283
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:50,439
Rym: That's all easy, but T-shirts that are awesome and not just awesome to GeekNights listeners, but awesome to everyone.

284
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:53,669
Rym: Harder to get done and then harder to get printed.

285
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:57,120
Rym: and then we got to put forth all the money to print thousands and thousands.

286
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:13,317
Rym: And yeah, so well despite not wanting to use the anime news network for news I kind of noticed randomly that they have a webcomic right like anime news network.

287
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,745
Scott: the webcomic It looks like.

288
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:15,048
Rym: well it.

289
00:22:15,492 --> 00:22:19,388
Scott: it's about it like Biting commentary on anime news.

290
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:21,557
Rym: It's an average webcomic.

291
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:27,339
Rym: Okay However, I went through much of the archives kind of quickly and I did notice this one gem.

292
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:37,927
Rym: All I want to say is that if you think that this comic is satire or that this is somehow an exaggeration of the truth The answer is that it is not.

293
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:40,800
Rym: so far from exactly what goes on at these cons.

294
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:42,625
Scott: No This comic could be.

295
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:45,657
Scott: I guarantee this exact thing happened at least once.

296
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:51,598
Rym: a hundred percent Exactly as you see it depicted in this comic, you know, there are people who'll read this comic and go I don't get it.

297
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,073
Scott: Yeah, they'll probably like hey what's going on?

298
00:22:55,476 --> 00:22:56,180
Rym: What's wrong with that?

299
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,511
Rym: I mean, obviously he thought about this thoroughly.

300
00:22:58,551 --> 00:22:59,857
Rym: That's quite a good commission there.

301
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:05,913
Scott: Yeah Good Alright, so I don't know if I've talked about this on the show before.

302
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:09,296
Scott: I tried to figure it out by searching But I'm not sure but it doesn't matter.

303
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:20,539
Scott: There's a guy named Lawrence Lessig and he is a famous lawyer a very important lawyer because he's pretty much like the Creative Commons Copyright kind of lawyer guy.

304
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:35,440
Scott: He's a semi moved on to dealing with issues of corruption instead of copyright because he came to the conclusion that Issues like copyright and global warming that he cares about aren't gonna be solved unless he solves the corruption problem first.

305
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:48,343
Scott: Regardless he gave this wonderful presentation at TED in like March of 2007 But it wasn't posted until November 2007 Which is now.

306
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:57,747
Scott: so you can now watch the presentation that he gave at TED in March and He's really good at presenting.

307
00:23:57,787 --> 00:24:01,138
Scott: you can see him give all kinds of talks on YouTube and Google videos.

308
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:02,619
Scott: if you search It's not hard.

309
00:24:02,881 --> 00:24:09,929
Scott: He's given tons of them and if you want to really know the deal of you know Why this Creative Commons going on and what it means.

310
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:14,203
Scott: and he doesn't actually mention Creative Commons in this because he's not allowed to sell Anything at TED.

311
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,760
Scott: that's sort of like the deal with the TED conference is you don't sell things there.

312
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:22,034
Scott: So he even says like yeah, I could mention something but I'm not allowed to sell anything.

313
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:38,791
Scott: He's talking about Creative Commons, but He talks about like Jean Philip Sousa saying, you know back in my day, you know kid people used to sit on the porch singing the songs of the day or the old songs and these Infernal machines are gonna ruin the vocal cords of the world.

314
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:57,592
Scott: and he talks about that in a modern Context and it gives three stories in one argument and if you he also used an anime music video as an example a particularly funny one involving a number num and Vampire Hunter D. Oh, man, so you should.

315
00:24:57,812 --> 00:24:58,535
Scott: you should watch this.

316
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:04,560
Scott: It's very enlightening I think even if I use it similar Lawrence Lessig speeches a thing a day in the past.

317
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,640
Rym: Well, we have but it's always been on Monday and there are many many people who only listen to Wednesday GeekNights.

318
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,180
Scott: Yeah, so if you're not like some tech nerd caring about copyrights, you're just looking at it from your anime fan sub perspective.

319
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:21,700
Scott: You should watch this video and it takes like it's 20 minutes long, which is kind of long to ask but you should watch it.

320
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,420
Rym: Anyway, so, uh Scott you you've been watching a lot of anime for all these years.

321
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:29,209
Scott: I've been watching anime since like 1990.

322
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:38,139
Scott: Well and knowing it was anime since like 98 99 Something like that and I've been watching anime not knowing it since I was like three watching transformers.

323
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:46,695
Rym: Yeah Since I was in fourth grade and I saw the sci-fi channel Saturday anime, but Ever seen any of that there?

324
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:59,832
Scott: hentai You know, it's kind of hard to go on the Internet's and the animes without, you know And being an anime communities without seeing some hentai, you know, I see some at the artists alleys I see some at the art show for hilarity.

325
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:05,860
Rym: one time our friend Steve just Randomly came into our apartment and showed us a bunch of hentai anime music videos.

326
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:08,608
Rym: Yeah unprovoked I might add.

327
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:11,918
Rym: yeah, you know, you know, we're sitting there we're bored.

328
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:13,866
Rym: Hey guys I got something we can watch.

329
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:14,891
Rym: it's on my laptop.

330
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:15,433
Rym: Oh, really?

331
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,619
Rym: What the fuck Steve?

332
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,016
Scott: Yeah, I've heard of things like the blue girl and the erosigatoshi.

333
00:26:21,277 --> 00:26:22,060
Scott: Those are unavoidable.

334
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:26,149
Scott: I've seen I've read the miko 2010 manga.

335
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:27,956
Scott: I mean they're volume of it.

336
00:26:28,217 --> 00:26:29,160
Rym: They're different levels.

337
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,083
Rym: I mean hentai.

338
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:36,650
Rym: we're not gonna get into the technical term of what is a hint a and what is it this and what is a Whatever.

339
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,640
Scott: I'm not even I don't care.

340
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:48,320
Scott: Yeah all we have to say is that if you don't know already hentai which is a word Americans use to refer to Anime and manga porn and in Japan the word hentai just means pervert.

341
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:49,507
Scott: That's and they.

342
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,699
Scott: but they also use it to refer to perverted things.

343
00:26:52,242 --> 00:26:55,979
Scott: But they also say things like ecchi and arrow arrow and stuff like that.

344
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:56,885
Rym: now I am going to.

345
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:58,500
Rym: we're gonna use a kind of broad definition.

346
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:04,840
Rym: I think we'll consider hentai just for the purposes of discussion to be any of that perverted anime stuff.

347
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:07,400
Rym: pretty much cuz I mean.

348
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:16,630
Scott: I guess you could count a lot of those doujins and those slash things and oh my I mean if you wanted to like Sanctuary and like crying Freeman and all these like a lot of the gecky guys.

349
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:18,777
Scott: have you know straight up?

350
00:27:18,977 --> 00:27:43,104
Scott: Well, you know uncensored screwing going on but it's not hentai because the Basically, my line is it's a hentai if it is a work of art that you know in manga anime form that is specifically made to arouse the reader or viewer through depiction of perverse and sexual

351
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:53,223
Rym: acts while some scenes in say dominion tank police when Anna Puma and Una Puma do that dance or the scene in Let's see.

352
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:54,207
Rym: What's a good example.

353
00:27:54,508 --> 00:28:03,718
Rym: Oh in sanctuary when what's-his-name is having sex with that woman But she's on top and then she jumps off and makes a killer stock trade and then jumps back on Yep.

354
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:11,660
Rym: Seems like that can be erotic or arousing particularly in tank police, but that they're just a part of a wider story.

355
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,162
Rym: It's not like the story is as happy as a fence I would put it.

356
00:28:15,483 --> 00:28:28,219
Rym: guy comes home guy gets laid guy gets tied up in the basement guy dies from getting laid First the large women then the speed to women then the large women again.

357
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:36,880
Rym: But no, I mean in fact sanctuary is even billed on the back as an erotic political thriller or something along those lines.

358
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:41,517
Scott: Yeah, so I guess if you took parts of sanctuary out, it would be just a hentai.

359
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:46,836
Scott: but in fact Maybe 10% of it is hentai in nature and 90% is not.

360
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:56,554
Rym: there's the gray areas Like there's wicked city and then there is as Dave from fast karate I keep bringing him up called it easy mode wicked city.

361
00:28:56,595 --> 00:28:57,660
Rym: Demon City Shinjuku.

362
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:11,600
Scott: yeah, you know it's stuff that's got a lot of crazy crap going on a lot of screwing perhaps some even rapin and Tentacles and maybe lots of bits hanging out and excess boobage were unnecessary.

363
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:19,089
Rym: But now this is definitely different from fan service or that edgy stuff where oh, no I saw a panty.

364
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:21,479
Rym: it had a picture of a panda on it.

365
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:28,886
Scott: Yeah, but the like if you want something like Demon City Shinjuku, you know There's a nakedness.

366
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:31,500
Scott: Maybe this there's a lot of violence and some perverted stuff.

367
00:29:31,581 --> 00:29:38,240
Scott: But it even though it's really bad It is a story about you know fighting and beating a monster and all that kind of crap.

368
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,525
Rym: So are a lot of hentai.

369
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:42,134
Scott: I know I know but that's it's a monster.

370
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:43,900
Rym: It's a monster of a different stripes.

371
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:45,868
Scott: There's more focus on them.

372
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:48,760
Rym: on this the plot often a soft focus, right?

373
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,097
Scott: Whereas if you watch something like Le Blue Girl, the plot is she's gonna get tentacled.

374
00:29:54,217 --> 00:29:55,040
Scott: She's gonna get tentacled.

375
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,682
Scott: Oh, look, she's getting tentacled and you're it's sort of designed The.

376
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:13,326
Rym: they created it with the intent that people watching it would be spanking the monkey now back in the day Not to sound old but it used to be different with anime because I mean before people really got it anime was widespread Most of us kids.

377
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:29,260
Rym: after we found out about anime from the sci-fi channel the only way we could really get it was either to spend exorbitant amounts of money for single VHS's at Suncoast or We go to the local Blockbuster and the people at the Blockbuster didn't know what the hell anime was.

378
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,149
Rym: Sometimes they had a anime section.

379
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:33,480
Rym: Sometimes they had a Japanimation section.

380
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,208
Rym: Sometimes it was just in with the kids stuff.

381
00:30:35,811 --> 00:30:44,700
Rym: But one thing was for sure Orochika doji and Armageddon would be sitting there right next to like go panda go panda.

382
00:30:45,382 --> 00:30:50,399
Rym: Because they had no idea and furthermore a lot of us just we didn't really.

383
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:53,514
Rym: you know We wanted any anime we could get and I would pretty much.

384
00:30:53,594 --> 00:30:59,552
Rym: every time I went to Blockbuster I grabbed the most interesting looking cover that I had not yet seen.

385
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:08,287
Rym: as a result a lot of earlier anime fans from our generation Saw hentai by accident I mean, I've got one of our friends.

386
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:09,813
Rym: we were talking about this over the weekend.

387
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:11,460
Rym: dragon half is hilarious.

388
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,330
Rym: Dragon half is one of my favorite like short funny OAVs.

389
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:16,959
Scott: It is absolutely all two episodes of it.

390
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:19,479
Rym: Well, there's a reason there's only two episodes.

391
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:21,694
Rym: Yeah, we're not gonna get into that.

392
00:31:22,138 --> 00:31:24,346
Rym: So He had heard from a friend.

393
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:27,480
Rym: Yeah, there's this anime about a dragon girl.

394
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,868
Rym: It's called like dragon pink or something.

395
00:31:29,948 --> 00:31:39,158
Rym: It's hilarious and he you know, he thought oh it this sounds great It sounds really funny and he went and he got dragon pink instead of dragon half.

396
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:44,559
Rym: Oops Uh, yeah, I'm not gonna tell you what the plot of dragon pink is, but you can guess.

397
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:54,915
Scott: Yeah Well part of what you know back in the day when they first brought anime over the way they marketed it was hey You know, let's if we you know, we want to market this.

398
00:31:55,216 --> 00:31:59,140
Scott: as you know Animation that's not for kids and we want to aim for those nerds.

399
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,400
Scott: So they got the most sexiest mostly violent stuff.

400
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:12,179
Scott: they could get to show how different it was and that's what they marketed and they got all the violent stuff like the ninja scrolls and Whatnot and the hentai and they're the over fiends sort of came along with that.

401
00:32:12,661 --> 00:32:17,380
Rym: Now the other thing was that as a kid, you know, a lot of shows kind of blindsided you with it, too.

402
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,952
Rym: I mean vampire hunter.

403
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:20,060
Rym: D was all awesome.

404
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:25,060
Rym: He's cutting that thing in half and he's cutting that other thing in half and then he cuts all those things in half.

405
00:32:25,141 --> 00:32:30,380
Rym: He cuts that guy in half That other guy cuts that first guy in half and there's a lot of cutting in half and eyeballs getting stabbed.

406
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,149
Scott: I like the the faces in hands.

407
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:34,320
Scott: That's my favorite part of that guy was awesome.

408
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,494
Scott: That's the best character, but you'll notice him in my thing of the day.

409
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:40,025
Rym: I remember as a kid I saw it on the sci-fi channel.

410
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:40,567
Rym: It's pretty good.

411
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,879
Rym: So I rented it and I brought it to my grandma's house.

412
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:49,748
Rym: I was like, oh man Cartoons and there was a bunch of scenes like.

413
00:32:50,270 --> 00:33:00,347
Rym: I remember a scene where the girl was taking a shower then D's sitting outside Kind of acting strange and then that scene just kind of cut away and there was a different scene And then I remember I watched it.

414
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:02,980
Rym: No, he goes in there and has sex with her in the shower.

415
00:33:03,402 --> 00:33:04,547
Rym: Huh or die?

416
00:33:04,587 --> 00:33:05,310
Rym: I don't think he does that.

417
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,395
Rym: I think there's just a naked scene.

418
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:09,648
Scott: I don't really remember it Yeah, but basically like that.

419
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,920
Scott: that's sort of like, you know, you watch a live-action horror movie in the u.s.

420
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,335
Scott: And there's always like the obligatory like chasing the girl her shirt gets ripped off.

421
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,644
Scott: kind of scene, you know That's what that was in.

422
00:33:18,684 --> 00:33:19,065
Scott: vampire.

423
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:24,745
Rym: hundred is sort of a horror accidental nakedness or like winds wind of amnesia Which was actually pretty good.

424
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:26,471
Rym: I at least I remember liking it.

425
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:29,020
Rym: I have not seen it in over a decade for all.

426
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,355
Rym: I know it's bad, but I liked it except the end was pretty much.

427
00:33:33,475 --> 00:33:34,860
Rym: All right plots over.

428
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,628
Rym: Everything's been resolved.

429
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,904
Rym: you we've given you our Lesson on humanity.

430
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:41,228
Rym: Oh, man.

431
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:44,980
Rym: Now the guy's gonna have sex with that alien girl for like five minutes.

432
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:49,120
Rym: Alright, so let's talk about focused on him licking her nipple for a while.

433
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:57,112
Rym: It's like I just remember sitting there as like a sixth grader being Really uncomfortable and not wanting my mom to walk in.

434
00:33:57,393 --> 00:33:57,974
Rym: but I didn't.

435
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,404
Rym: I wanted to see the end because I was worried that be More plot.

436
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:01,894
Rym: I really wasn't aroused.

437
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:07,134
Scott: I was just sitting there like All right, so let's talk about actual hentai here right?

438
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:08,480
Scott: so you got hentai.

439
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:20,940
Scott: It's it's someone drew a picture or animated pictures of people doing sex often Which is impossible sex type stuff and someone out there is watching this and being aroused.

440
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:22,713
Rym: Are you aroused?

441
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:23,478
Scott: because I'm not.

442
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:28,800
Rym: Well the most aroused I ever was by an anime was in Dominion tank police.

443
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:33,251
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I really like, you know, I can watch me.

444
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,900
Scott: a normal porn, you know, as long as it's not a freaky porn You know.

445
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:40,560
Scott: and some porn is arousing some is not most is not actually but there's some porn out there.

446
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:54,400
Scott: It's hard not to be aroused unless you are I don't know biologically dead or you need vag or something, but Hentai really just doesn't do it for me and I kind of wonder about the people that it does do something for me.

447
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,529
Scott: Like what about their psychology or their biology?

448
00:34:58,251 --> 00:34:59,715
Scott: Is it that makes them that way?

449
00:34:59,775 --> 00:35:00,397
Scott: Is it is it a?

450
00:35:00,618 --> 00:35:01,440
Scott: is it a born thing?

451
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,645
Scott: Or is it an environmental?

452
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:02,986
Scott: I don't know.

453
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:05,516
Rym: What I'm not a I'm not a furry vore file.

454
00:35:05,596 --> 00:35:06,540
Rym: I was just born that way.

455
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:07,724
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

456
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:08,527
Scott: What do you think?

457
00:35:08,547 --> 00:35:09,430
Rym: You know what?

458
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,517
Rym: I really don't know and I need your nurture.

459
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:15,669
Rym: on the hentai enjoyment I really don't think I care to be honest.

460
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:17,173
Rym: I really just to me.

461
00:35:17,193 --> 00:35:19,580
Rym: I look at it from a very simple perspective.

462
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,498
Rym: It's out there some people like it.

463
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:37,736
Rym: You can pretty much classify anime fans into people who don't really talk about it People who watch it and then that category gets broken up into two sides People who are aroused by it and then the people I didn't realize existed for a long time.

464
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:41,680
Rym: Ah, yes You can tell this one.

465
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:54,440
Scott: Okay, the thing about hentai right is that if you just watch a hentai for the purposes of arousal I mean not everyone who does that is a total scary freak But most people tend to be I mean the stereotypical hentai guy.

466
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:55,664
Rym: I mean I have never.

467
00:35:55,684 --> 00:35:59,780
Rym: well with rare exception and because I can't say never I've actually met a few people.

468
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:05,430
Scott: I've met a few people who watch hentai and are not scary freaks You know and just get aroused at it the same way.

469
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,700
Scott: I watch porn and it just happens to be their thing.

470
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,402
Scott: There's nothing wrong.

471
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:13,940
Rym: I can say though that the majority of people I have spoken with who watch hentai are hentai.

472
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:16,487
Rym: There is one guy in particular.

473
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:21,385
Rym: I remember at RIT won't mention any names, but no doesn't matter was another Steve We knew like ten Steve's.

474
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:22,068
Scott: so yep.

475
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:24,540
Scott: It was a different Steve than the one who showed us the music video.

476
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,750
Rym: It's also a different Steve from the Steve that case Western warned us about.

477
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,399
Rym: and it's a different Steve from another Steve.

478
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:32,408
Scott: and There's a lot of Steve's.

479
00:36:32,488 --> 00:36:33,254
Rym: half of them were good.

480
00:36:33,314 --> 00:36:34,120
Rym: half of them were scared.

481
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,752
Scott: I know Steve in high school too, so it's like getting out of control.

482
00:36:37,234 --> 00:36:39,748
Rym: so uh this guy You know he hangs out with us.

483
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:41,056
Rym: You know I like anime.

484
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:41,680
Rym: do you like anime?

485
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,456
Rym: And I'm like yeah, I like anime you like anime - we can be friends.

486
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:48,120
Rym: We're in college We can all be anime friends, and we're all at the anime club.

487
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,040
Rym: We're walking out from the anime club, and he's like man.

488
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:54,919
Rym: You want to come back to my place and watch them whatever and I didn't know what that show was.

489
00:36:54,939 --> 00:37:00,288
Rym: no I want to go do something else okay, and I kept saying the names of these shows And I never heard of anyone.

490
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:04,593
Rym: and I thought I knew a lot about anime But I'd never heard a half of the things he'd bring up.

491
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:11,982
Rym: and then one day He just starts describing one while like two of us are eating breakfast at Gracie's, and he's like yeah So then he

492
00:37:12,002 --> 00:37:13,989
Scott: disembowels the girl - Gracie's is the food court by the way - yeah,

493
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:19,920
Rym: then he disembowels the girl and then and I'm like wait a What he's like yeah, and this is when it gets really good.

494
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:24,956
Rym: And then they start to and he goes into a graphic description of this horrible hentai.

495
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:28,769
Rym: and at that point I was like ah all right look we're gonna.

496
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:29,652
Rym: We're gonna leave.

497
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:31,760
Rym: We're hoping that you'll stay there until we're gone.

498
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,018
Rym: So you keep eating.

499
00:37:35,082 --> 00:37:36,428
Rym: You can have the rest of my food if you want.

500
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:36,931
Rym: I don't think it's.

501
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:37,172
Rym: uh.

502
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:38,720
Rym: I don't think I need it anymore.

503
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:39,222
Rym: Yeah,

504
00:37:39,644 --> 00:37:58,067
Scott: but then thanks to the people at the Happy House of hentai We were enlightened that you know while the vast majority of people watching hentai Are kind of scary and some are not And while we are not personally aroused by hentai that hentai does have a purpose in this world Basically the Happy House of hentai podcast.

505
00:37:58,087 --> 00:38:02,103
Scott: we met them at Cinecon and we went to their panels because there wasn't much else doing Really for us.

506
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:04,694
Rym: I wasn't sure what to expect because most cons were.

507
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:06,200
Rym: I'd gone into a hentai panel.

508
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:07,405
Scott: It was scary.

509
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:11,420
Rym: and the worst is I went to one anime con, and it was late at night.

510
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,600
Rym: And I wander into a showing room and there's hentai on alright, and I look at the crowd.

511
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:20,620
Rym: It's like five dudes sitting there in silence enjoying it.

512
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:24,617
Rym: That was that was frightening to say the least.

513
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:28,734
Scott: yes But the Happy House of hentai people what they did in their podcast is there?

514
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,080
Scott: their podcast has some good bits.

515
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:31,308
Scott: It's like they.

516
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:31,932
Scott: they answered.

517
00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:33,000
Scott: they go he goes online.

518
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:41,255
Scott: You find some like questions that people ask doctors about their you know sexy problems And he answers almost always dude go see a doctor.

519
00:38:41,335 --> 00:38:42,500
Scott: I know, but it's so funny.

520
00:38:42,962 --> 00:38:44,027
Scott: The answer is these questions.

521
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:46,900
Scott: I could just he could do a podcast of just answering those questions.

522
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:48,439
Scott: It'll be enough for me.

523
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:53,654
Scott: But they review hentai and I see review in the way that say I don't know.

524
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:59,530
Scott: Dave and Joel review things or the zero punctuation of the anger video game.

525
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,714
Scott: nerd review things you know.

526
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:05,339
Scott: they review hentai and They describe the plot of hentai in it.

527
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,100
Scott: It's sort of different hentai as they watch and sort of a literal not so literal way.

528
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:15,120
Scott: And if you look at it from the ironic standpoint, it's just hilarious.

529
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:16,626
Rym: I mean, there's.

530
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:17,248
Rym: it's kind of like.

531
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:17,509
Rym: you know.

532
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:23,360
Rym: you see something happen, and you don't really think much of it But then someone else just kind of lays it out for you.

533
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:37,531
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you look at it directly like if there's a hentai and someone's disemboweling someone and screwing their insides I don't know or tying their penis with a rope so they can't ejaculate and then torturing them or if it's just What's the word ah?

534
00:39:38,662 --> 00:39:43,031
Rym: Fortune ah You all right dick girls.

535
00:39:43,272 --> 00:39:44,618
Rym: Oh futanari futanari.

536
00:39:44,638 --> 00:39:45,000
Scott: There you go.

537
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:46,486
Rym: This is the thing you said.

538
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:47,591
Rym: what's the word?

539
00:39:47,672 --> 00:39:49,159
Rym: and I had no context for that.

540
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:54,316
Scott: yeah So even if it's futanari or something right if you just watch futanari you just go.

541
00:39:54,597 --> 00:39:55,440
Scott: ah oh god.

542
00:39:56,305 --> 00:40:10,521
Scott: But if someone sits around if you sort of meta And you sort of like watch and take a step back and realize that This is a someone drew a picture of this it suddenly just becomes a big joke sort of like if you watch fist of the North Star.

543
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:15,940
Scott: it's like a dude making people's heads explode and some people they like a dude making dudes heads explode.

544
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:17,094
Scott: I could go for that.

545
00:40:17,154 --> 00:40:25,471
Scott: sometimes I'm not you know you're not alone in that, but if you take a step back, and you say oh my god This is dude making dudes heads explode.

546
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,443
Scott: It's twice as good It's.

547
00:40:28,463 --> 00:40:38,376
Scott: so I think I've discovered this use for hentai that was previously unknown to me in that It's basically ultra comedy if you take a step back from it and look at it from afar.

548
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:40,122
Scott: some of it some of it That's true.

549
00:40:40,603 --> 00:40:45,600
Scott: There is some hentai that is so horrible that you can't make it comedic.

550
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:50,320
Rym: It's just horrible in all through and through, but it really helps if you're not even watching it.

551
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:56,599
Rym: There's this someone describing it in a very deadpan kind of but deadpan with foreshadowing and proper pausing.

552
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:01,218
Rym: like so the guy comes home, and he walks into the basement.

553
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:05,639
Rym: and What does he see, but the girl and a penis?

554
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:14,632
Rym: Second and then he's like now you might be asking yourself.

555
00:41:15,113 --> 00:41:17,480
Rym: Are there any other people in the room besides this girl?

556
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:19,965
Rym: Now no there aren't.

557
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:25,099
Rym: you know where that penis is you know exactly where it is, and you know it's coming for him.

558
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:31,699
Rym: Oh, and watch out obviously he doesn't escape Otherwise it wouldn't be any fun.

559
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,532
Rym: Okay That's the kind of thing that that I don't know.

560
00:41:37,572 --> 00:41:38,516
Rym: if I can do it justice.

561
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:39,119
Rym: I'm not that guy.

562
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:50,140
Scott: Yeah, I do think that the the only other thing I had to say about hentai at least maybe Rym has something else to say Is that it's sort of problematic for us in a way in that?

563
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:58,512
Scott: It's sort of because of hentai's popularity, and it's being brought over to the US and stuff There's sort of in manga and anime.

564
00:41:58,573 --> 00:41:59,900
Scott: It's sort of a trap in a way.

565
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,173
Scott: It's like I think freedom of speech and all that stuff in freedom of the press.

566
00:42:03,193 --> 00:42:06,427
Scott: We should you know expression We should have hentai.

567
00:42:06,447 --> 00:42:14,430
Scott: it should be available to people who want it as long as it's not harmful which it isn't because it's all drawings right and That that's a good for them.

568
00:42:14,651 --> 00:42:16,220
Scott: You know let those people have their thing.

569
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,300
Scott: But it's sort of because of its sort of spread.

570
00:42:20,782 --> 00:42:22,027
Scott: There are people who get the improve.

571
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:32,140
Scott: there are some people out there who actually think that anime is just like naked porn Ultraviolet anime from Japan which is part of because of old marketing, but I had a teacher in high school.

572
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:33,305
Rym: He was a really cool guy.

573
00:42:33,325 --> 00:42:38,327
Rym: He was a communist straight-up like red communist, but he was otherwise.

574
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,130
Rym: well, I guess.

575
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:56,772
Rym: otherwise he was a really cool guy, but He one day we're talking about Japan and he brings up the topic of moggings, and he basically said manga is this Ultraviolet form of comic book that is found in Japan Uh-huh, and I was like uh it's not all ultraviolet.

576
00:42:56,812 --> 00:42:58,377
Rym: He was like yes, it is.

577
00:42:58,738 --> 00:42:59,380
Rym: It's cathartic.

578
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,287
Rym: That's why there's no violence in Japan.

579
00:43:01,307 --> 00:43:02,592
Rym: and the next day.

580
00:43:02,652 --> 00:43:06,951
Rym: I brought in some tenchi muyo manga, and I was like ah You saying this is ultraviolet.

581
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:11,289
Scott: Yeah, yeah But that's sort of like those people who you know.

582
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:14,160
Scott: a lot of people think wrong things about foreign countries.

583
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,569
Scott: They're they haven't studied them enough.

584
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:17,058
Scott: You know that's just how it is.

585
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:20,771
Scott: but Regardless there's this sort of another catch with the yaois and stuff.

586
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:24,992
Scott: all these yaoi manga and the BL mangas are coming over Which is great for those BL fans.

587
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:26,160
Scott: let him let him do their thing.

588
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,325
Scott: I'm not I'm not into that.

589
00:43:27,406 --> 00:43:30,600
Rym: obviously you all realize that there is going to come a day.

590
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,070
Rym: I don't know when it might be tomorrow.

591
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,798
Rym: It might be next year, but one day Somewhere out there in the

592
00:43:36,939 --> 00:43:37,000
Scott: US

593
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:50,200
Rym: Someone's mom is gonna go into their 14 year old daughter's bedroom and pick up one of those you know picture books that she always gives her money for and See Sephiroth making a cast of his own penis in order to impregnate himself.

594
00:43:51,043 --> 00:43:55,119
Scott: Like I did that one you made a cast of your penis to impregnate yourself.

595
00:43:58,548 --> 00:44:03,096
Rym: Well now It was that time when we you remember right?

596
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:06,492
Rym: yes Yeah, you're making fun of me, but seriously not.

597
00:44:07,115 --> 00:44:14,800
Rym: we were at a friend's house And for some reason a friend who had many yaoi doujins the topic something like that came up in conversation.

598
00:44:15,142 --> 00:44:16,674
Scott: I think we were at a friend.

599
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:17,520
Scott: We're at a friend's house.

600
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,163
Scott: There are many people.

601
00:44:18,183 --> 00:44:28,180
Scott: there was a semi party and the friend of the hat the friend who lived in that house one of the Friends who lived in that house had a large or semi large yaoi doujin collection Which is fine because they were a cool person whatever.

602
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:34,060
Scott: I didn't care what they did in behind their bedroom right and somehow making a cast of a penis came up in conversation.

603
00:44:34,745 --> 00:44:45,593
Scott: So she runs into her bedroom goes under her bed Brings back a yaoi doujin of Sephiroth making a cast of his penis and then impregnating himself with it And then I don't know what was birthed from that, but that's all I saw.

604
00:44:45,633 --> 00:44:46,436
Scott: that's all I needed to see.

605
00:44:46,456 --> 00:45:03,100
Scott: in fact I saw too much but Someone's mom is gonna find out what the word yaoi means and there's gonna be ramifications in the u.s Yeah, it's really I mean I really personally I'm not so bothered by if you know BL.

606
00:45:03,343 --> 00:45:06,255
Scott: Stop being printed in the u.s I mean I do think it should be allowed to be printed.

607
00:45:06,295 --> 00:45:06,860
Scott: freedom of speech.

608
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,159
Scott: But because I don't care about it personally it won't bother me if it goes away.

609
00:45:10,763 --> 00:45:17,796
Scott: What will bother me is the fact that it'll it might hurt Manga as a whole in the u.s.. If people start getting this wrong impression.

610
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,950
Scott: You know like one second You know some girl.

611
00:45:19,991 --> 00:45:26,619
Scott: she goes and buys Naruto But she also goes and buys boys kissing and then mom finds the boys kissing and then no more Naruto.

612
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:29,871
Scott: sales Go down, but that's not good, but they love each other.

613
00:45:29,892 --> 00:45:30,795
Scott: I'm sure I'm sure.

614
00:45:32,824 --> 00:45:36,683
Scott: So yeah, there is that danger aspect of hentai And I think it would.

615
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:43,400
Scott: it's right now the industry seems to be sort of like being hush-hush And I think they really need to be more out with it.

616
00:45:43,440 --> 00:46:01,340
Scott: It's like if you come out with it first You know and just warn people and then make it clear and instead of having you know sort of twisted and spun up stories out of the media from you know some Hype and outrage as opposed to stories from the industry about itself putting out the truth.

617
00:46:02,023 --> 00:46:07,832
Scott: Yeah, I think it'd be better to do some preemptive defense here But no one seems to want to do that because that would be the end.

618
00:46:07,892 --> 00:46:14,000
Scott: people would suddenly you'd be you know It'd be immediately opening the can of worms rather than keeping it closed for as long as possible.

619
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:19,780
Rym: So I guess have you actually ever seen a hentai and not just a clip from a hentai?

620
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:26,844
Scott: I don't think I've ever and I've never sat through an entire episode or movie of hentai anime And I've never.

621
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:32,400
Scott: I guess if you count Maiko 2010 is the most perverted entire volume of manga I've read.

622
00:46:33,302 --> 00:46:33,683
Scott: That's it.

623
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:36,471
Rym: I have in fact seen a hentai.

624
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:37,513
Scott: What hentai did you see?

625
00:46:37,934 --> 00:46:40,080
Rym: I watched the the famous.

626
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:55,972
Rym: This is probably Hiroshi Yamakawa's seminal work I actually don't know if he's ever done anything else put out by studio pink pineapple released in 1995. it is none other than Erufuno Waka Okusama, which is elven bride.

627
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:57,376
Scott: Oh that one.

628
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:58,699
Scott: you've told me about that one.

629
00:46:58,779 --> 00:47:05,430
Rym: now I watched elven bride kind of by accident Because I like like elves a lot.

630
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,640
Scott: Rym really likes elves if you don't know that elves dragons.

631
00:47:09,064 --> 00:47:10,779
Scott: Yeah, Rym really likes elves.

632
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:14,932
Rym: So I see you know on my goddess and it's great.

633
00:47:15,454 --> 00:47:29,932
Rym: and then I see in the blockbuster Elvin bride and I read the back and it's some dude marries an elf but then hi jinx ensue and I think oh Man, this is gonna be all like oh my goddess, but also all like slayers.

634
00:47:30,092 --> 00:47:31,236
Rym: I'm all about this.

635
00:47:31,256 --> 00:47:31,978
Scott: Hey good.

636
00:47:32,138 --> 00:47:34,290
Rym: It is funny And you know what?

637
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,080
Rym: It is really funny.

638
00:47:35,161 --> 00:47:43,419
Rym: the one thing I can say about this is that of All of all the hentai I've seen in terms of you know Someone's showing me a music video or someone describing it to me.

639
00:47:44,202 --> 00:47:47,296
Rym: It's actually really tame and it's actually kind of funny.

640
00:47:47,557 --> 00:48:08,791
Rym: and but Regardless the plot is basically there's this dude and he marries an elf On their wedding night, they're gonna fuck they're gonna They're going to consummate the marriage, but they discover that there is an inherent Incompatibility between humans and elves.

641
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:10,680
Scott: I thought humans and elves had the same parts.

642
00:48:10,941 --> 00:48:12,008
Rym: Well, apparently not.

643
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:12,934
Rym: it is there.

644
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:16,608
Rym: there's a problem and Something will not fit into something else.

645
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:19,260
Scott: Is it because one thing is too big or the other thing's too small?

646
00:48:20,043 --> 00:48:24,319
Rym: It might be a little bit from column a a little bit from column B because they don't actually show.

647
00:48:24,339 --> 00:48:26,307
Rym: it Makes me very happy.

648
00:48:26,327 --> 00:48:27,753
Scott: It's not a hentai then is it?

649
00:48:27,914 --> 00:48:29,300
Rym: Well, I would consider it a hint.

650
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,059
Scott: Okay, but but does that mean that elf guys have really small ones?

651
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,613
Rym: Actually, I know the answer to that because I did watch it to the end.

652
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:44,140
Rym: Oh god, but So as a kid, I'm watching this and now I'm thinking this isn't what I expected.

653
00:48:45,842 --> 00:48:50,869
Rym: I wonder how this is going to continue, but I kept watching of course except I hope my mom didn't walk in.

654
00:48:51,411 --> 00:48:58,860
Rym: and it goes on and he Decides that he has to go on a quest a quest to find the famed harpy ooze.

655
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:10,648
Rym: Harpy ooze That doesn't sound good the most lubricitious Substance in the known world Uh-huh, and now I'm thinking all right.

656
00:49:10,689 --> 00:49:12,155
Rym: This definitely isn't what I expected.

657
00:49:12,657 --> 00:49:13,340
Scott: See that's a it.

658
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:13,983
Scott: That's definitely.

659
00:49:14,003 --> 00:49:15,009
Scott: I don't know if that's a hentai.

660
00:49:15,029 --> 00:49:16,900
Scott: It's more of an erotic comedy in a way.

661
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:23,499
Rym: Yeah, I guess it would be but the thing is the when I got to the end I discovered that Oh, it's just a whole bunch of sex scenes.

662
00:49:24,022 --> 00:49:25,728
Scott: You know, I remember there was some college.

663
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:29,302
Scott: it might even been in right it wasn't RIT, but it might have been U of R I'm not sure.

664
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:52,555
Scott: but I definitely heard a story of a college that every year would they would have an event where they took a Porn an actual porn put it up on like a giant screen and everyone would go and watch it and they wouldn't watch it seriously, they'd watch it ironically like You know like that and maybe it might be fun sometime to like get a one of the tamer Not gonna vomit hentai's and sort of watch it in a party lull setting.

665
00:49:52,695 --> 00:49:54,908
Rym: I think elven bride is the thing It might work.

666
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,188
Scott: I think it is Something similar.

667
00:49:57,229 --> 00:49:58,497
Scott: Does anyone know anything similar to that?

668
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:06,820
Rym: Elvin bride - oh god now I never actually saw elvin bride - but I will say this double harpy ooze.

669
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:11,720
Rym: I found the box and then I read online and I discovered what the plot is.

670
00:50:12,182 --> 00:50:14,089
Rym: Now the plot in the first one was he has to go.

671
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:17,885
Rym: he could not get the harpy ooze and I just remember It was.

672
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:19,069
Rym: it was kind of funny.

673
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:26,053
Rym: But anyway, so elvin bride - The plot is the problem was half resolved.

674
00:50:26,515 --> 00:50:37,810
Rym: to fully resolve it the elvin bride goes to a gynecologist who happens to be an incubus and Then a dragon and a werewolf come great.

675
00:50:38,231 --> 00:50:40,419
Scott: Yeah, you have to fight them with harpy ooze.

676
00:50:41,284 --> 00:50:43,116
Rym: I don't know if the harpy ooze comes back.

677
00:50:43,217 --> 00:50:45,828
Scott: I Just think harpy is pretty funny.

678
00:50:45,848 --> 00:50:48,780
Rym: It's even funnier when he finds out what harpies are.

679
00:50:49,662 --> 00:50:52,879
Scott: Yeah, all right, do we got anything else to say about hentai's?

680
00:50:53,521 --> 00:50:54,003
Rym: Not really.

681
00:50:54,023 --> 00:50:58,496
Rym: I don't really plan to watch hentai in the future unless I have a large group of people.

682
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:10,651
Scott: Yeah, and all that Wow, this yeah, maybe Plan to watch porn with a large group of people, you know It wouldn't be that bad of an event if we were to say Otakon.

683
00:51:10,691 --> 00:51:15,647
Rym: and we did the same, you know, Saturday night OMG 18 plus and we got.

684
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:24,593
Rym: we showed elvin bride and we got us and some other people maybe Dave and Joel or anime world Order and as you do MST 3k MST 3k a hentai.

685
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:26,620
Rym: that might actually be really funny.

686
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:28,751
Scott: I wonder someone's gotta have done that already.

687
00:51:28,771 --> 00:51:33,214
Rym: Yeah, I think we could do it pretty well Especially if we also do mystery anime theater.

688
00:51:33,274 --> 00:51:35,799
Scott: if we could just do mystery hentai I think someone had to do mystery hentai.

689
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,029
Scott: But if we did not be a new idea we did it.

690
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:45,560
Rym: and furthermore if we got the happy house a hentai guy Yeah to come and do it with an Arizona the Lord cows, you know, I'd be willing to fly him out for that.

691
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:46,527
Scott: Yeah, probably.

692
00:51:47,212 --> 00:51:47,474
Rym: All right.

693
00:51:47,514 --> 00:51:48,179
Rym: I think we're done.

694
00:51:49,062 --> 00:51:51,148
Rym: So yes, we finally talked about it.

695
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:51,891
Rym: Pray.

696
00:51:52,091 --> 00:51:53,475
