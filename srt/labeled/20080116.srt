00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,094
Rym: It's Wednesday January 16th.

2
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:17,855
Rym: I'm Rym I'm a Scott and this is a geeky night tonight for the first time in a long time.

3
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:19,560
Rym: We review some freaking anime.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,042
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:28,750
Scott: I get to work this morning.

6
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:31,456
Scott: do my normal work thing right?

7
00:00:31,496 --> 00:00:33,240
Scott: It's Wednesday this breakfast.

8
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:34,669
Scott: I get me a bagel of course.

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,200
Scott: I was a little slow on the bagel action So I actually got like one of the last bagels.

10
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:49,996
Scott: I took this poppy seed bagel that was looking kind of haggard and the only other bagels left in there were like this salt Bagel and these sort of nobody likes the salt bagel and like these brown bagels that were.

11
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:54,294
Scott: obviously that we I don't know But I think it was like a pumpernickel bagel or something.

12
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:55,440
Rym: Oh, that sounds really good.

13
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:56,442
Scott: It was.

14
00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:57,426
Scott: he was not popular.

15
00:00:57,446 --> 00:01:03,570
Scott: That's just because people don't understand now, so I toast my Second-rate poppy seed bagel.

16
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,174
Scott: I go back.

17
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:05,080
Scott: I need a beverage.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,154
Scott: Yeah, I just drank some orangey, but I still need something to wash the bagel down.

19
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:09,360
Scott: drink the orangey before the bagel.

20
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:15,440
Scott: So I go to get some water and now the water cooler at our work doesn't actually get water in it.

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,833
Scott: Well, it does, but you don't have to put the stupid bottle.

22
00:01:17,873 --> 00:01:21,339
Scott: water cooler doesn't have water You don't have to put the stupid bottles in it.

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:21,802
Scott: It's just.

24
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:27,091
Scott: it's hooked up to the tap and has a filtered tank in it And you just put your cup under.

25
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:28,520
Scott: you push the button and you're good to go.

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,733
Scott: You put your Nalgene and you push the button and water comes out All right, and it's cold and it's from the tap and it's New York.

27
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:35,596
Scott: So doesn't matter, right?

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,856
Scott: I Go to push the button and for the first time ever Nothing comes out.

29
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:45,200
Rym: So I'm like, huh, you know, that's a really unexpected.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,540
Rym: I mean there have been a couple of times in my life where I turn on a faucet and nothing comes out.

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:02:00,920
Rym: but the thing is usually when that happens if it's not through like if it's a normal faucet if There isn't water there instead of water you get possibly some brown sludge, but usually a horrible banging noise.

32
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:04,832
Scott: Yeah, now it just kind of word little, you know compressor in there.

33
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:07,219
Scott: I guess word a bit and nothing came out says, huh?

34
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:13,139
Scott: So I'm just like fuck it and I go sit down again and then there's an email a little while later like yeah We have no water.

35
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:16,279
Rym: That's what you get for having some like those.

36
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:18,087
Scott: There's like a broken water.

37
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:20,256
Scott: main on everything in the city is always.

38
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:24,011
Scott: it's never the building It's always something happened on some street somewhere.

39
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:25,799
Scott: It's like water main broke on X Street.

40
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:29,040
Scott: Telephone switch broke on Y Street, you know, you know.

41
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,946
Scott: Anyway, a water main broke on some street.

42
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:33,471
Scott: So we didn't have water.

43
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:39,012
Scott: I think the 12th floor had water and Probably maybe because we're on the second floor.

44
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:40,420
Rym: There's a tank at the top of the building.

45
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:43,420
Scott: Yeah, so we had to go like 10 floors up if you needed to pee, which you know.

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,860
Rym: There's been some scary stories about those tanks because usually no one maintains them and there's been some interesting things found floating in them.

47
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:49,604
Scott: Oh, yes.

48
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:52,277
Scott: Yes, indeed, but I did not go to the 12th floor.

49
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:52,740
Scott: I held it in.

50
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:56,655
Rym: Not like in that movie that short.

51
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:57,318
Scott: I didn't need to go.

52
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,229
Scott: that bad Anyway, but my co-worker right.

53
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,067
Scott: so normally it sucks if electricity goes out you can go home But if water goes out you got to stay.

54
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:09,583
Rym: All right, so my co-worker then water was the only thing that ever made RIT shut down.

55
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:10,907
Scott: I know right 9/11.

56
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:12,352
Rym: We're going 12 feet of snow.

57
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:13,014
Rym: That's fine.

58
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:24,086
Scott: No water send the kids home Yep, but then my co-worker, you know, he was getting pretty pissed you know, he's gonna go out to like a restaurant to pee or something, but then His computer stops working.

59
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:25,773
Scott: Like I think his power supply died.

60
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:27,580
Scott: pretty sure that that's the current diagnosis.

61
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:34,768
Scott: I think it's obvious that he sabotaged it so he could go home and the other co-worker whose job it is to fix that Sick today, so he just went home.

62
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:36,132
Scott: No, it was actually broken.

63
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:36,634
Scott: I checked it.

64
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:38,440
Rym: Oh, no, I'm not doubting that it was broken.

65
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:40,546
Rym: I'm wondering how it came to be broken.

66
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:41,749
Scott: He didn't sabotage it.

67
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:42,191
Scott: Trust me.

68
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,936
Rym: There wasn't a paperclip sticking.

69
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:45,360
Scott: I checked it.

70
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,719
Scott: Maybe then again, maybe he let me check it so he'd have proof.

71
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:51,927
Scott: Anyway, so he goes home.

72
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,044
Scott: I'm sitting there and eventually after a few hours I'm like, I couldn't.

73
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:58,353
Scott: I was think I was gonna make lunch and at work.

74
00:03:58,414 --> 00:03:59,960
Scott: I have peanut butter and jelly and a knife.

75
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,259
Scott: I couldn't clean the knife to make lunch.

76
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,920
Scott: Wow, so eventually I get fed up and I go over back to the water cooler thing and I put my nalgene under there.

77
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,051
Rym: I push the button and water comes out, you know, usually when there's a water main break You're not supposed to use the water that comes out for like 12 hours.

78
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:17,397
Scott: I know but I said fuck it.

79
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:18,120
Scott: I'm using this.

80
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:19,846
Rym: Oh, you're gonna die or whatever.

81
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,780
Scott: I know well, it was going through the filter in that little machine, right?

82
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:23,447
Scott: So I was okay.

83
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:24,580
Rym: Is there a filter there?

84
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,582
Scott: Yeah It's a machine.

85
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:32,204
Scott: that's just a filter and a compressor and a cooler and the tap water comes into it through a little hose and you Push a button and the water comes out.

86
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:32,947
Scott: That's all it is.

87
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,540
Scott: So I push the button the water comes out and I'm like, ah But I didn't think the water was fixed.

88
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:45,755
Scott: I just thought I got lucky and I got the last of the water or something like that Even though that doesn't make sense since previously no water was coming out at all.

89
00:04:46,157 --> 00:04:46,639
Scott: I didn't care.

90
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:52,260
Scott: So then I'm like, alright and then I go back to my desk and there's you know an email that says the water is fixed.

91
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:53,415
Scott: I'm like, oh that explains it.

92
00:04:54,061 --> 00:05:07,468
Scott: so I go to the sink and I clean off my knife and the sink was pretty funny because when I put the sink when I put the sink on hot water it came out normally right because the hot water, you know Must have been in a tank somewhere, you know waiting around But the cold water was

93
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:07,809
Rym: a minute.

94
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:14,912
Scott: if that means you probably could have used the hot water to wash your knife I know But the cold water was like put put put put put put put.

95
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:16,096
Scott: it was pretty funny.

96
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,100
Scott: I like the cold water.

97
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,498
Scott: He was making the sink jump up and down.

98
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:23,320
Rym: So did you have the classic problem whenever water starts up again of the infinitely flushing toilet?

99
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:25,807
Scott: Well, you why are you stealing my thunder?

100
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:26,872
Rym: because that happens.

101
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:27,755
Rym: It's a common thing.

102
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:28,740
Scott: Why you got me doing that?

103
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:33,840
Scott: I was giving you the opportunity because I was gonna bring it up in a second.

104
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:34,663
Scott: I was next.

105
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:39,578
Rym: all of you out there understand how excited Scott was about the fact that the toilet wouldn't stop flush.

106
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,080
Scott: Oh, man.

107
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,140
Scott: So our bathroom is notorious for that being shitty.

108
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:47,091
Scott: It's like the worst bathroom ever cuz on the second floor.

109
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,480
Scott: so all these UPS guys use it and shit and it sucks.

110
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,111
Scott: But you know after I make my lunch and whatnot.

111
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,215
Scott: I gotta finally pee.

112
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:55,300
Scott: I finally drank water.

113
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,225
Scott: So now I had to pee.

114
00:05:56,828 --> 00:06:02,247
Scott: I go in there and I hear a toilet flushing And I pee and I still hear this toilet flushing.

115
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:06,600
Scott: I go over there and this toilet is flushing and it's not stopping.

116
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,580
Scott: It just keeps flushing and blushing.

117
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:11,951
Scott: Water keeps coming out and water keeps going down.

118
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,682
Scott: It's like it's permanent cyclone and I'm like, oh man We're gonna go.

119
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:16,826
Rym: Did you tell anyone?

120
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,953
Scott: No, I just let it go.

121
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:20,518
Rym: I should have told someone.

122
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:21,160
Rym: What do I care?

123
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,180
Scott: I still go and no it's not cuz I went in later wasn't going anymore.

124
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:28,128
Scott: but Yeah, it was pretty funny to watch this toilet.

125
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:29,755
Scott: Just keep going and going.

126
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,040
Scott: it was like a perpetual toilet.

127
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:33,673
Scott: Yeah, and they see perpetual motion machines are not possible.

128
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:34,860
Scott: explain that toilet.

129
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:36,363
Scott: It kept going.

130
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:45,214
Rym: So what today I had to listen to some guy tell me this story on how the water was out in his building And I was flushing infinitely something like that.

131
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:46,380
Scott: Yeah, it was pretty awesome.

132
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:53,811
Rym: There's you know, I was looking at the anime news, you know, it's anime day and you know ostensibly manga comic day But there's never news about manga.

133
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,321
Rym: There's there's never news You don't.

134
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,386
Scott: the manga news is.

135
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:58,114
Scott: this new manga was licensed.

136
00:06:58,134 --> 00:06:59,540
Scott: this new manga was licensed.

137
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,188
Scott: This new manga is going to be so created now.

138
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:06,060
Rym: I often say ah, there's no anime news, but there's no freakin anime news today.

139
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:08,533
Rym: There's nothing I care about to talk about.

140
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,518
Scott: there is nada.

141
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:15,680
Rym: So, uh, I figured I should do a some sort of geek bite cuz it's been a while or a geek back.

142
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:17,393
Rym: It's gonna be a geek bite for me.

143
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:22,520
Rym: Okay, I Long time ago, you know, I read the first ghost in the shell manga.

144
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:25,319
Rym: It was it was kind of epic and awesome and I really enjoyed it.

145
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:27,186
Scott: It's something any manga fan should read.

146
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:32,723
Scott: really any comic any comic reading person should read that at some point no matter if you like Manga or not.

147
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:35,996
Scott: you really it's one of those necessities up there with like the watchman.

148
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:38,366
Scott: It's not as good as watchman But it is really good.

149
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:38,989
Scott: It's really good.

150
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:41,440
Scott: It's not watchman good, but it's this necessity to read it.

151
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,062
Scott: You gotta read it.

152
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:45,232
Rym: Scott had had the issues of the second manga.

153
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:46,657
Scott: That's actually funnily enough.

154
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:51,420
Scott: I Stopped buying comics and I was a kid right when the comic book store in the mall went out of business.

155
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,175
Scott: Right and when I was a kid, I read x-men and I read spider-man 2099, right?

156
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,071
Scott: I stopped reading them, you know when the comic store out of business.

157
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:09,460
Scott: I didn't read comics again until Like around 2000, you know when I was in college He went to the borders right and we go to the borders every once in a while to hang out look at stuff.

158
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,327
Scott: You know, they had the meager manga shelf.

159
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:14,057
Scott: Remember that manga shelf and everything on it was amazing.

160
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:14,800
Scott: Even if it was crap.

161
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:21,419
Scott: Yeah, it was great and we'd go to that manga shelf and I almost bought some manga.

162
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,360
Scott: sometimes I think I might have bought like initial D number one there and stuff like that.

163
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,180
Scott: But they had a comic rack in the borders.

164
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:30,232
Scott: It was like a bigger than usual comic rack for borders is.

165
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:39,875
Scott: and on that comic rack I at one point when I was looking at the magazines I happen to notice ghost in the shell - man-machine interface issue number one.

166
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:40,876
Scott: I said, holy shit.

167
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,179
Scott: Look at that It's I got it and I went back the next month and got number two.

168
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,020
Scott: I don't like the next month again number three.

169
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,688
Scott: And then eventually my friend Ian got me going to the conflict store again And now I have boxes coming every month.

170
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:56,198
Rym: No, uh, thank you Shiro.

171
00:08:56,358 --> 00:09:04,680
Rym: I avoid reading that partly just because I hate issues like I. Comic books are so unpleasant to read that I just can't deal with it.

172
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:08,819
Rym: I'm gonna get some sort of compilation or trade or I'm just not gonna bother.

173
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,663
Rym: there is No, what if?

174
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:13,720
Scott: what if I took like all the issues right and I bound them together into a single book?

175
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,156
Rym: It's still that big floppy paper.

176
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:22,080
Scott: If it was quality binding maybe but now actually for ghost in the shell - I kind of like the issue.

177
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,920
Scott: I don't like the separation of the issues into the separate, you know things.

178
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,040
Scott: I like it all to be together.

179
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:31,612
Scott: But the bigger Pages really helped that manga because a lot of little things in it.

180
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:33,400
Rym: I didn't feel like I missed anything.

181
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:34,367
Scott: No, you probably didn't.

182
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:35,819
Rym: but well anyway, here's the deal.

183
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,160
Rym: Scott's been trying to get me to read this forever.

184
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:39,906
Rym: It's been in the pile along with.

185
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,775
Scott: it goes in the shell - goes in the shell.

186
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,940
Scott: one epic must reads.

187
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,952
Scott: It goes in the shell - it's got to be epic must read right now.

188
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:47,860
Rym: Scott would never say anything beyond.

189
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,038
Rym: Yeah, you got to read this.

190
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:56,654
Scott: Well, I would say a few things like we'd be watching say stand Solid state society and you're like, oh this is this.

191
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:57,759
Rym: is this happens in that?

192
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,713
Scott: well No I say wow this reminds me a lot more of goes in the shell - that it reminds me of.

193
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:02,256
Scott: goes in the shell.

194
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:16,684
Scott: one like it goes In the shell - it's a lot more hacking stuff and it's always with you know The big circles and the gates and all that stuff and the sort of they use those same visuals in some of the later Set in standalone complex second gig and in Solid state society.

195
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:21,060
Scott: So when those visuals came up I'd be like, ah, this is a lot like goes in the shell - man.

196
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:23,626
Rym: So I finally read it.

197
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:24,669
Scott: you like that tanuki.

198
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,180
Rym: right the two key was those was arguably the best part.

199
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,873
Rym: That's nuki Andy of the wolf spirit the way that was drawn.

200
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:31,737
Rym: I thought was really cool.

201
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:32,380
Scott: That's okay.

202
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:37,455
Rym: Beyond that I mean I enjoyed it, but I read it and I felt like all right.

203
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:38,056
Rym: I'm reading this.

204
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:46,044
Rym: I'm reading this I I know what's going on and I got to the end and then I thought back and I realized that I had no fucking Idea what had happened.

205
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:48,475
Scott: that entire goddamn mong explain the plot to me.

206
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:49,399
Rym: You know what?

207
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:53,231
Rym: Uh, so so a bunch of pigs died, right?

208
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,193
Scott: What were the pigs doing?

209
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:55,096
Scott: Why were they special?

210
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:59,088
Rym: Well, uh Arguably, they're being used for some nefarious purposes.

211
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,115
Rym: But who by who?

212
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:02,840
Scott: well, what were they supposed to be used for?

213
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,751
Scott: Organs and what were they being used?

214
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,240
Rym: brains but not organ.

215
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:10,608
Rym: That is so not the plot.

216
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,339
Rym: No, but but I I don't.

217
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:20,748
Rym: There's a point at which I could have just stopped reading and I would have had the same understanding of the manga As if I'd continued reading.

218
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,280
Rym: I got to the end and realized that the second half of the manga.

219
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:28,093
Rym: Not only did I not know what happened, but I suddenly realized like wait a minute.

220
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:30,920
Rym: No, her name is Kusanagi not Aramaki.

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,345
Rym: Why didn't I notice that before then?

222
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:33,208
Rym: I'm like, oh, wait a minute.

223
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:35,296
Rym: Well, what the god damn it?

224
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:42,307
Rym: It's one of those things Shiro I Defy you to tell me what the fuck happened.

225
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:51,019
Scott: and ghost in the shell - I can actually sort of piece it together But you know how many times I've read it Seven more than four at least.

226
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:56,728
Rym: The thing is basically I got to the end and I'm like, wow That was really profound.

227
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:04,440
Rym: and then I realized that everything I was thinking about that was profound Was not something that I'd read in the manga but something I was thinking about because of ghost in the shell.

228
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:14,860
Scott: I think the thing about ghost in the shell - man-machine interface the manga right because well, I guess it's only a manga is that There is a plot a literal plot.

229
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:21,720
Scott: You can get it by reading extra carefully and extra slowly and extra and multiple times and extra painfully.

230
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,511
Scott: But that plot is not really the point and it doesn't matter.

231
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:28,821
Rym: I think I think the point of ghost in the shell - What?

232
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,066
Rym: well there are a lot of points.

233
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:44,987
Rym: I think basically it was Shiro just Kind of getting his mind on the paper and ghost in the shell just happened to be the way he was doing that Yeah, and it was basically just him thinking about Well, what if this and what if this?

234
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:48,800
Rym: you know kind of like speculative fiction but at the same time Shiro-tastic.

235
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:56,554
Scott: Yeah, basically each page each scene each you know action is just something to like.

236
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:01,665
Scott: work your brain and The plot suffers.

237
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:06,700
Scott: the coherency of the plot suffers as a result of extreme imagery.

238
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:16,339
Rym: Yes I mean there is a point at which I think she was in a game but maybe not and I pretty much lost track of Plot from that point on yeah, and she switches into like using like D cots.

239
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:25,591
Rym: fine with the D cots until I couldn't figure out if she was in a D cot or in the real world or Or if the D cot was in the real

240
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:30,880
Scott: and maybe the point is to get your brain to do that Or maybe it's just Shiro and he's just a crazy nut job.

241
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:31,240
Rym: Yeah

242
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:32,865
Scott: I mean or maybe both

243
00:13:33,166 --> 00:14:03,758
Rym: my real idea is that one of the ideas Shiro was trying to get across is that the world that The entity that is arguably known as the major What lives in now and exists in is so utterly different and so much faster paced than the real world that like Every now and then it kind of cuts out of following the main character around and just shows you like humans Doing things and the humans are a lot like the humans are moving so slowly and doing so little compared to what she does in like two minutes.

244
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,643
Rym: that Beyond that.

245
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:13,837
Rym: I don't know what happened something with a tree at the end and something I don't even know who was hacking the pigs if there even were any thugs.

246
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,704
Scott: Yep Yep, something like that.

247
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:17,948
Rym: Okay, I don't get it.

248
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:19,453
Rym: I suggest you read it.

249
00:14:19,494 --> 00:14:21,280
Rym: However, you read it again.

250
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,274
Rym: Maybe I think what really got me about it.

251
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:24,040
Rym: I mean I enjoyed it.

252
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,679
Rym: Don't get me wrong, but the fact that Shiro has footnotes and it's not like.

253
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,700
Rym: well Here's a footnote to explain this and here's the footnote.

254
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:39,792
Scott: There's one footnote because early in the manga there's like these two flying machines, right and he basically puts a footnote like yeah I know these flying machines are impossible because of blah.

255
00:14:39,832 --> 00:14:41,358
Scott: I just drew them this way cuz it's better.

256
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:47,355
Scott: Sorry It's like what you're talking about what's possible and impossible in your made-up future.

257
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:49,000
Rym: Oh, he goes well beyond that.

258
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:59,360
Rym: I think my favorite footnote is on a random page and I Swear to you that this footnote has nothing to do with what is happening on that page or any page anywhere near it.

259
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:02,770
Rym: He just has a random footnote talking about how the u.s.

260
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,074
Rym: Is upgrading its military.

261
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:05,659
Rym: Now, maybe Japan should do the same.

262
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:12,108
Rym: Yeah military fanboy for sure Shiro, I gotta hand it to you man.

263
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:13,252
Rym: That was some.

264
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:15,199
Rym: that was some epic manga right there.

265
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:23,337
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so when someone says shirotastic and you're not quite sure with it that mean I think ghost in the shell.

266
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:25,682
Rym: the second manga Epitomizes.

267
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:26,504
Rym: now sure.

268
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:28,950
Rym: I think it is the second most shirotastic.

269
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:32,740
Scott: if I'm to understand correctly Orion is the most shirotastic.

270
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,354
Rym: Well, I have never in any way engaged with Orion nor have I but I know better.

271
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:48,497
Rym: so as far as I have experienced the As far as someone who would even consider anything Shiro believes to be a valid philosophy could believe to be true.

272
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:52,409
Rym: Ah That was the most shirotastic thing I've ever witnessed.

273
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,312
Scott: All right, you ready?

274
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:54,556
Rym: I think we're ready.

275
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:56,959
Rym: That's that I could come up with tonight.

276
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,503
Scott: I was uh, I was just you know Looking around cuz.

277
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:08,208
Scott: I've been watching the galaxy Express 3 9 TV show recently because some someone's fansubbing it so nicely But their fansub me too slowly.

278
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:09,294
Rym: Well Scott has this thing.

279
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,383
Rym: It's like whenever he's tired Like my.

280
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,547
Rym: when I'm tired, I go to bed.

281
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:14,313
Rym: Maybe I masturbate or something.

282
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:20,792
Rym: I don't know but when Scott's tired He'll put on some leji Matsumoto like old melodramatic side.

283
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:30,760
Scott: lady Matsumoto's anime are Amazing all of them, but they only work When it's dark and when it's late at night and when it's quiet.

284
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:38,250
Scott: That's the only time they work and then when it when that's true, they work Amazing if you're Scott and if you're tired, they work even better.

285
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,620
Rym: I think you're confusing lady Matsumoto with space ghost.

286
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:47,000
Scott: Well, I think part of what it was is when I was you know young and I first discovered lady Matsumoto, right?

287
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:48,579
Scott: It was on the sci-fi channel.

288
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,594
Scott: It was late at night on anime week on the sci-fi channel and

289
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,700
Rym: you watched galaxy

290
00:16:53,262 --> 00:17:03,039
Scott: Galaxy Express 3 9 movie dubbed and then the second Galaxy Express 3 9 movie the next day also dubbed late at night in the dark and the couch in my living room alone and that's sort of.

291
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,240
Scott: It really worked on me.

292
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,089
Scott: That was like more than any of the.

293
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:19,536
Scott: that was like really when I started Super animating that week of anime right because it was like Fatal Fury Fatal Fury 2 Galaxy Express Galaxy Express 2 and then something else shitty that I remember Sean or something.

294
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:24,740
Scott: I don't remember a son terror No, I think was actually only four days because then I think Godzilla started which is also awesome.

295
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:26,144
Scott: By the way, Godzilla vs.

296
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:27,849
Scott: Mothra is the best Godzilla movie.

297
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,073
Scott: hands down hands down.

298
00:17:29,093 --> 00:17:30,397
Scott: No one can say anything else.

299
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:31,180
Scott: You're all wrong.

300
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,520
Rym: Well, I think it comes down to the fact that my Mothra edge like 10 to the score of any Godzilla.

301
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:46,088
Scott: Yeah, and while well, well Ghidorah is the best of all the monsters, you know in coolness and lookingness Cuz he's like a hydra with three heads Mothra is still better.

302
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,779
Scott: So whatever anyway.

303
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:55,916
Scott: So, you know that was that was my experience with that and that more than any other anime I watched that week was like the double awesomes.

304
00:17:56,358 --> 00:18:06,533
Scott: So Every time I watch even other leiji Matsumoto things like harlocks and things like that I always try to go for the same feeling and it always works.

305
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:07,456
Scott: I don't know.

306
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:08,540
Scott: it always works on me.

307
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,163
Scott: It's always great.

308
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:18,100
Rym: The result is whenever we have the crew over we're ready to you know, the nights winding down We're about to maybe all retire for the evening or maybe play one last game of something.

309
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:26,375
Rym: Scott always suggests that we watch some sort of not necessarily leiji Matsumoto But I think pretty much either that or a night on the galactic railroad.

310
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:29,812
Scott: It was Dying like to grow Galaxy Express.

311
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:30,697
Scott: There's a link.

312
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:35,140
Rym: Yes The problem is one of them is good one of those boring.

313
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:38,960
Scott: Well, he based the Galaxy Express off of the you know.

314
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,740
Scott: Well his idea to have trains in space was because of the novel of nine the Galactica.

315
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,468
Rym: But anyway, oh, yeah, I'm not.

316
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:46,740
Rym: I mean I just that movie is so boring.

317
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:50,819
Scott: Anyway, so watching anime again, right cuz I'm watching Galaxy Express TV show.

318
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:56,640
Scott: I realized I can watch like five plus anime episodes a day if I watch them on the train.

319
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,475
Scott: So I was thinking hey, I'm gonna actually go back now.

320
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,951
Scott: I'm gonna watch that Ava I'm gonna do it and then I'm gonna watch that eska flown.

321
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:06,820
Scott: a I'm gonna do it and we're gonna make the show, right?

322
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,220
Rym: I've been waiting for this day for a long time because I'm itching to talk about eska flown.

323
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:13,551
Rym: That's still to this day one of my top three.

324
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:15,360
Rym: That is one of the best anime ever made, right?

325
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,320
Scott: So we're gonna do those right as soon as I get her out.

326
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,550
Scott: Yeah, they're only 26 episodes so I could probably watch them in a week.

327
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:20,314
Scott: Yeah, right.

328
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:25,754
Scott: So anyway Realizing that I said hey, I gotta watch the cowboy bebop.

329
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:26,940
Scott: I've seen it like five times.

330
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,065
Scott: I get to see it seven times.

331
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:33,067
Scott: So I'm like, I wonder if I can buy it and You know, it was available first.

332
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:35,114
Scott: They made it available on the original DVDs.

333
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:48,017
Scott: Well VHS then DVDs The VHS is are mad expensive because like two episodes of tape The DVDs are mad expensive You know because there were a whole bunch of them and the box set was like a hundred something dollars.

334
00:19:48,077 --> 00:19:49,829
Scott: and today if you want That original box set.

Scott: Then they came out with like these best sessions Which was like a little set that had like the best the quote best episodes or the most important episode.

337
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:03,600
Rym: That seems really kind of silly though, cuz you got to watch cowboy bebop all the way through it.

338
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,460
Scott: All right, I had like the most process everything.

Scott: Is that if you have never seen cowboy bebop if you don't own it all if you have seen it, it doesn't matter.

Scott: Now is the time to buy all of cowboy bebop for thirty seven forty nine.

347

Scott: that is the great.

349
00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:50,720
Scott: I will go farther than that.

350
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:57,924
Scott: I will say that is the greatest value you could possibly get in anime ever Ever existed.

351
00:20:58,044 --> 00:20:58,846
Rym: not necessarily.

352
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:04,020
Rym: However in all of entertainment because I we paid 50 cents to see the powerpuff girls movie.

353
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:14,062
Scott: Yes, but this is the best dollar per awesome You can get in terms of purchasing anime on DVDs that has ever existed in the history of the world and probably will for quite Some time.

354
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:17,760
Scott: I mean if you let you know someone gives you something like, you know for free.

355
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:21,060
Scott: But we're talking about like a you know a deal at a store not a deal.

356
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:25,120
Rym: What not that that epic box set that we saw for sale.

357
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:29,210
Scott: So, you know this got me thinking right you look cowboy bebop.

358
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,955
Scott: anime is you know bandai?

359
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:32,420

00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,659
Scott: They're doing anime legends.

361
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:39,200
Scott: So that must be their new sort of like labeling of their awesome box sets and things like that.

362
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,762
Scott: You know of the?

363
00:21:40,144 --> 00:21:43,980
Scott: let's take old anime re-release them on new DVDs and sell them for less money.

364
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,280
Scott: They're gonna call it anime legends.

365
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:52,032
Scott: So I go to write stuff and I search for anime legends and I got a whole bunch of stuff But I don't care about most of it because some of it's not.

366
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:52,334
Scott: you know.

367
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:53,680
Scott: box set some of its other things.

368
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:55,375
Scott: So I'm looking for the thin pack collection.

369
00:21:55,415 --> 00:22:00,114
Scott: So I type in You know anime legends complete collection.

370
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:01,380
Scott: you ready for the list here?

371
00:22:01,802 --> 00:22:04,538
Scott: These are all excellent values in anime that I recommend.

372
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:07,524
Scott: ready Agent Aika, no, I don't recommend that.

373
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:08,405
Scott: our Joe.

374
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:09,467
Scott: I know I don't recommend that either.

375
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:09,928
Scott: Here we go.

376
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:15,093
Scott: big Oh $36, oh man, but that's just season one.

377
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:16,760
Scott: It's $36 also for season two.

378
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,623
Rym: They're both worth it.

379
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:20,434
Rym: Big O one is one of the better giant robot shows ever.

380
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:21,137
Scott: That's not too.

381
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:22,020
Rym: is Ava done better?

382
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:29,300
Scott: That's not a very good value because you're paying as much as you are for 26 episodes of cowboy bebop for 13 episodes of big.

383
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:33,128
Scott: Oh, but big I was so good Then this is probably still the cheapest way to get it.

384
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:35,538
Scott: if you can't get the old bricks so big.

385
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:43,507
Scott: Oh Blue sub 6 complete collection not bad crest of the stars Eska flown a $45 that is well worth it.

386
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:44,249
Scott: Check this out.

387
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:55,381
Scott: This pisses me off because I bought this individually just by disc Gundam seed The first 25 episodes for $45 and then the second 25 episodes for $38.

388
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:57,708
Rym: I want to say one thing real quick about Gundam seed.

389
00:22:57,749 --> 00:22:59,514
Rym: if you don't like Gundam shows.

390
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:00,236
Rym: Well one you're.

391
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:01,139
Rym: I hate you.

392
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:08,767
Rym: but if you know if you haven't seen a Gundam show before or if you just don't think you like Gundam shows or Prejudice

393
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:20,019
Scott: to get or you have misconceptions if you've never watched one and you have some sort of prejudice about what you think they're like or if you've seen one and Maybe you saw the wrong one a G Gundam and you had you know.

394
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,347
Scott: you think you know what they're like.

395
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:29,167
Scott: and if you haven't seen Gundam seed or You haven't watched like Zeta Gundam or the original Gundam You really don't know Gundam.

396
00:23:29,187 --> 00:23:33,535
Scott: a lot of you will think they know it and don't like it or think they know it and do like It but they really don't know it.

397
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:34,824
Scott: Buy this.

398
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:36,290
Rym: Yes, seriously.

399
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,539
Scott: I paid a lot more for this and I'm not sad.

400
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,550
Scott: Gundam wing DVD collection one.

401
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,756
Scott: so I assume there's gonna be a -.

402
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:45,432
Rym: I'll say one thing The dub is not as good as you thought it was.

403
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:48,083
Rym: Yeah as a kid Let's see.

404
00:23:48,304 --> 00:23:49,229

00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:58,416
Rym: Yeah, you know I never saw the end of that because everyone said it was Tara save or marionette J complete collection.

409
00:23:58,456 --> 00:24:01,308
Rym: scrap princess complete Princess is kind of worth watching.

410
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:02,051
Scott: which hunter Robin?

411
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:02,774

Rym: Are you just gonna name all these?

413
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,151

00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:07,116

419
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,381

00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:39,440
Rym: Alright, we can get this done quick.

441
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,849
Rym: There's this show is called persona hyphen Trinity soul.

442
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:49,790
Scott: Yeah, so the only good thing about this show is that our favorite voice actor in the known universe.

443
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,770
Scott: Takehito koyasu plays one of the care of me somewhat major characters so off his game.

444
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,557
Scott: Yeah, he doesn't sound like when he.

445
00:25:56,678 --> 00:25:58,345
Scott: when he first talked I was like.

446
00:25:58,385 --> 00:26:01,837
Scott: that sounds like koyasu But I was like, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

447
00:26:01,857 --> 00:26:06,110
Scott: it sounds like a type koyasu imitator, but no, it's really him.

448
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,067
Scott: So he must be off his game.

449
00:26:08,189 --> 00:26:09,413
Scott: now There's something not right.

450
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:19,644
Rym: shows being directed by some guy who is known for jack all great and Honestly, the show is pretty bad, but it's not bad enough to make fun of.

451
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,190
Rym: it's just really not entertaining.

452
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:28,394
Rym: The only thing it's got going is that basically the plot as far as you can tell from the first episode is People have souls.

453
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:34,370
Rym: those souls are also giant robots and people have psychic giant robot battles and that's it.

454
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:36,390
Scott: That's pretty much all that's going on in the show.

455
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:46,381
Scott: I mean, it's like these two siblings and like they don't have a home and they have to go back to live with their brother or Something and I think this lives kind of exemplifies everything.

456
00:26:46,401 --> 00:26:57,630
Rym: that's wrong with a lot of anime that comes out these days because this show Reminds me a lot of several other shows I've watched in recent memory where the first episode like the character designs are kind of generic.

457
00:26:58,073 --> 00:27:00,069
Rym: The animation is kind of sterile and boring.

458
00:27:00,612 --> 00:27:09,830
Rym: They always introduce characters and give all this stuff about him, but they also introduce some central mystery And they pretty much ignore that mystery or don't tell you enough to know anything about it.

459
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:16,909
Rym: but they also want to give you enough to care about the characters and They kind of jump in the middle of something that you don't care about and they don't go anywhere with.

460
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,110
Scott: yeah I think the primary problem with the show is that they toss you into it, right?

461
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:43,450
Scott: They first and you know It's at the classic anime first beginning of the first episode thing where they show you Some mysterious like government or military group doing something mysterious and then a strange event occurring or something like that And then they cut and they give you the opener and then they throw you to the main characters and then you know that whatever They're get whatever is gonna happen to them is gonna relate to that mysterious thing.

462
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:51,951
Rym: They showed you 30 seconds of the beginning and apparently the plot involves of people being turned inside out by something called Reverse.

463
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:58,870
Rym: Yeah, it's just this show does not look like it has any potential to be in any way entertaining.

464
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:05,270
Scott: It's so boring, I think pretty much the major problem with the show is that there's no reason to care about anything.

465
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:06,949
Scott: It's like people are being reversed.

466
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:09,399
Rym: Okay, I still crack up.

467
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,047
Scott: It's not even like, you know, huh?

468
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,562
Scott: There's some clues and now I can start thinking about a mystery.

469
00:28:14,602 --> 00:28:18,361
Scott: It's like no just people are being reversed Alright, and I'm supposed to wonder about why.

470
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:25,209
Rym: just pretty much from that alone Every conversation the character has just goes nowhere and you don't care and it they always refer.

471
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:25,490
Scott: no one.

472
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:26,661
Scott: I think it's another problem.

473
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:27,629
Scott: a lot of anime do this.

474
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:30,592
Scott: No one has any direct Conversations.

475
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:34,146
Scott: everyone just sort of thinks a lot of things but no one says anything to anyone.

476
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:39,926
Scott: people just kind of look at each Other and then walk around and they say things like offhand comments that reference things.

477
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:47,890
Scott: We don't know about like brother If only blah or that guy blah blah blah, which guy you talking about?

478
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:55,181
Scott: you're purposely saying that guy so we don't know which guy you're talking about, you know, and This just it's not where it was.

479
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:56,827
Scott: just the first episode is so painful.

480
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:57,609
Scott: I couldn't continue.

481
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,196
Scott: go I think the music was okay though.

482
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,942
Rym: Yeah, but the opener didn't really fit.

483
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:02,850
Rym: It was one of those generic openers.

484
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:03,970
Rym: It's just the show's got nothing.

485
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:11,630
Scott: No You can skip persona Trinity soul even though it's kind of sad because it's one of the few shows I've seen in recent years.

486
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,573
Scott: It's like the.

487
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:16,990
Scott: the percentage of moe shows to non moe shows is getting pretty off.

488
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:22,630
Scott: There's a lot more moe shows going on or at least shows with moe elements if not full-on moe moe shows.

489
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:27,242
Scott: And it's kind of sad that one of the non moe shows is shitty.

490
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:29,248
Rym: So don't even bother with this show.

491
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:30,455
Scott: It's not good Yep, skip it.

492
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,090
Rym: So, uh There's another show we checked out and this one has a lot of promise.

493
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,350
Rym: However, you have to be a certain kind of anime fan to enjoy a show like that.

494
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,950
Scott: You have to be in the right situation in the right mood to enjoy the show.

495
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:50,398
Scott: This show's actually from 2007 and it was ran from April to September 24 episodes so Lovely complex.

496
00:29:50,860 --> 00:30:01,098
Scott: that might sound like a bad moe Show, maybe a harem show of some sort something like that, but it's actually One of those cute funny shows.

497
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:03,446
Scott: there aren't too many shows in this category.

498
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:13,858
Scott: It's sort of like karakano Sort of like koto-cha in there sort of like koto-cha sort of like Haniori Dango, it's one of those sort of shows.

499
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:19,790
Scott: It's a. it's a comedic high school shoujo thing and It's really not too bad.

500
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:32,698
Scott: I mean, it's not something I would go out and watch a whole lot of you know, like diligently But if I'm in sort of a silly mood and I need me some laughs or maybe I'm an anime club And I want to get everyone riled up.

501
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:37,130
Rym: This is the medicine, you know There hasn't been a show like this in a long time.

502
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:44,149
Rym: This show fills the koto-cha hole because if you want that kind of show You got to go to the old stuff or you can come to this show right here.

503
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:50,964
Rym: There's there's definitely there's a lot of uh, Mon's Eye going on Which I'm a big fan a big fan of that Mon's Eye action.

504
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:52,110
Rym: The plot is pretty simple.

505
00:30:52,130 --> 00:31:00,690
Rym: There's a there's a girl who is really tall and there's a guy who's really short and they hate each other But they have a lot in common.

506
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:03,975
Scott: They have a hell of a lot in common but and they're sort of like.

507
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:11,527
Scott: they're sort of like friends and enemies at the same time like to hang out with each other and You know, they team up but also they hate each other.

508
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:20,081
Scott: and so like Right, and you can tell that they that you know, they're supposed to end up together But it's like something they wouldn't even think of.

509
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:22,450
Scott: you know, it's it's it's one of those kind of situations.

510
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,890
Scott: It's sort of a cliche situation and it's a little obvious.

511
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:37,150
Scott: Right and and what's gonna happen in the episodes is always sort of obvious because the shallow High school comedic romance plot more heavy on the comedy than on the romance, you know That's not the point.

512
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:53,489
Scott: the point is that the jokes that are actually go on during the show are actually kind of funny and endearing and it's like oh but then it's like lol's epic lol's and They actually kind of act like normal people and they make real-world kind of jokes and it's just silly and fun.

513
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:58,930
Scott: And then occasionally, you know, there's crazy slapstick stuff to like people getting hit over the head.

514
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,562
Rym: Yeah, definitely a child's toy kind of vibe going on there.

515
00:32:02,602 --> 00:32:04,770
Rym: Also the main character kind of reminds me of waka ba.

516
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:09,796
Rym: Yeah, kinda only much more Gruff and maybe a little consign.

517
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:11,761
Scott: Yeah, maybe a little bit.

518
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:15,210
Rym: Oh, I didn't even realize this is directed by a konosuke Uda.

519
00:32:15,551 --> 00:32:15,973
Scott: Who's that?

520
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,290
Rym: He also directed Galaxy Express 999 internal fantasy.

521
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,474
Scott: That's yeah, that's not.

522
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:27,914
Rym: and the Sailor Moon super s movie clearly the best of the Sailor Moon movies my best I mean worst.

523
00:32:28,577 --> 00:32:31,350
Scott: Yeah, I mean the show has some other stuff going on in it, too.

524
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,610
Scott: You know, there's there's like, you know some school stuff.

525
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,109
Scott: They actually pay attention to what's going on in school a little bit.

526
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,551
Scott: you know.

527
00:32:36,591 --> 00:32:48,088
Rym: what really makes the show stand out is kind of it's the opposite of persona Trinity soul and that The character designs have character and just the way they talk and interact and the way everything's done.

528
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,194
Rym: There's There's enough going on.

529
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:55,289
Rym: that gives the show charm that just some of these other newer kind of sterile shows just don't have.

530
00:32:55,369 --> 00:33:00,148
Scott: yes Definitely it is the exact opposite of persona Trinity soul in a way because it doesn't really have much of a plot.

531
00:33:00,168 --> 00:33:07,170
Scott: to speak of The episode we watched, you know a couple episodes we watched the what was gonna happen was so contrived cliche and obvious.

532
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:12,581
Scott: It might as well nothing might as well have happened But you know it the characters you care about them.

533
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,410
Scott: Each character is really characterized.

534
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:23,317
Scott: Yeah, you know you and they interact with each other and interesting or you know At least funny ways quite often.

535
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:24,501
Scott: that's pretty much the whole show.

536
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:25,585
Rym: and the show is really.

537
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:27,130
Rym: it's stylized.

538
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:32,630
Rym: The way it's drawn and the way everything is put together is it stands out from all the other anime coming out lately.

539
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,170
Scott: Yeah, well at least there's a lot of bright colors so we can kind of hurt your eyes sometimes.

540
00:33:36,672 --> 00:33:39,604
Scott: But other than that, you know, it's not those moe colors though.

541
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:44,462
Rym: It's actual bright colors Yep, not those like faded moe girl hair color, whatever.

542
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:50,490
Scott: No, no, it's actually bright colors Like, you know super gals kinda that kind of color.

543
00:33:51,233 --> 00:33:51,414
Rym: now.

544
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:56,940
Rym: last and certainly not least a lot of people have been talking about this show and I Was a little leery.

545
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,570
Scott: but I was also a little bit leery.

546
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:06,564
Rym: I heard enough good buzz and especially once I heard what the plot nominally was I actually I kind of am excited about seeing more of this show maybe.

547
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:14,370
Scott: so the show is called Spice and wolf right and at first I was like, uh-oh This is gonna be a not a furry show for furries, right?

548
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:26,730
Scott: because the picture you see when you look for this show is like a girl with ears and a tail and You think there's gonna be big-time moe furry action, that's what I expected to see but we watch it anyway.

549
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:32,139
Rym: Yeah, I mean basically I expected it to be Uto are they do mono - And he wasn't.

550
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:33,012
Rym: well the thing is.

551
00:34:33,353 --> 00:34:45,041
Rym: then I was told the plot and it seems like it's it's definitely said in a European Middle Ages kind of you know monotheism is kind of making its rounds and the old gods are being forgotten.

552
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:48,034
Scott: and this this will is the plot of the the final.

553
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:52,963
Scott: well the Final finished chapter of Phoenix the same plot something like that.

554
00:34:52,983 --> 00:34:56,799
Rym: Yeah, but basically this wolf goddess is Her time has passed.

555
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,389
Rym: She the people no longer need her.

556
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:03,446
Rym: so she is going to leave and travel to the lands in the north and she needs help.

557
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:10,209
Rym: so she kind of Shanghai's this poor merchant who's just passing through town into taking her north.

558
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:14,250
Rym: Yep, and I'm not sure exactly where they're gonna go with this.

559
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:23,217
Rym: I've only seen one episode but this show if they go in any of the directions that I think it might go in and there's two or three directions it could Go in where I would be pleased.

560
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,290
Rym: The show is actually got a lot of potential.

561
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:26,674
Scott: Yeah, definitely.

562
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:36,750
Scott: The only thing this I don't like the show 100% I mean, I really that merchant main character guy I really kind of don't like him so much like he seems kind of glad.

563
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:41,326
Scott: I wish he was more like when I first saw him like I imagined.

564
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:42,310
Scott: I guess this might be a problem.

565
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:52,289
Scott: Imagine him being a lot like ginkgo from mushishi because he kind of looks like him Kind of looks like him a little bit and if he was like that kind of character I think the show would be a lot more awesome, you know.

566
00:35:52,390 --> 00:36:00,030
Scott: But he seems kind of just like a normal kind of merchant Like he's just like a normal average dude and the way he acts is sort of bland.

567
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,157
Scott: I really don't care about him that much.

568
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:07,799
Scott: but other than that like what goes on in the show and the plot and the style Is all really high quality.

569
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:17,162
Rym: See I like him partly because the way You know, they're whenever there's this sort of alright There's a magical girl something and she meets a guy and the kind of.

570
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:20,270
Rym: there's the trope of how that would play out in anime.

571
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:21,765
Rym: You can see what's gonna happen.

572
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:22,108
Rym: Mm-hmm.

573
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:23,990
Rym: And in this show doesn't really turn out that way.

574
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:30,490
Rym: He reacts more like a reasonable person would react and she reacts in a completely unexpected way.

575
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:34,388
Scott: Yeah, I guess that's because you know the way they've made the main character guy.

576
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:34,930
Scott: What's his name?

577
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,595
Scott: Craft Lawrence craft Lawrence.

578
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:41,007
Scott: the way craft Lawrence is is he's such a normal merchant.

579
00:36:41,027 --> 00:36:42,050
Scott: He's just like hey, what's up?

580
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:42,674
Scott: I'm a merchant.

581
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:43,097
Scott: How you doing?

582
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,770
Rym: He talks and he's got his own drama.

583
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:48,016
Rym: There's a girl who likes him But he has problems with that.

584
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:52,550
Rym: cuz she's kind of young and blah blah blah blah blah, and he's got his business to take care of.

585
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:56,747
Scott: Yeah, but I mean he sees this like wolf God and he's like you're not a wolf God prove.

586
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:57,350
Scott: You're the wolf God.

587
00:36:57,652 --> 00:36:59,184
Scott: Oh shit, you proved the wolf God.

588
00:36:59,244 --> 00:37:01,359
Rym: Oh my god see, I think that's the point.

589
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:06,907
Rym: that pushed the show over the line because The show was you know serious, but that was the funniest joke in the whole show.

590
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,057
Rym: Oh my god There's there's a there's a little.

591
00:37:09,298 --> 00:37:11,830
Scott: it's not a comedy show, but that was a funny bit.

592
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:13,278
Rym: It was it was more of.

593
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:19,509
Rym: it was one of those kind of Jokes that is in the context of the show like a character makes a joke.

594
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:21,138
Scott: It was sort of an Admiral Pelle.

595
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:23,450
Scott: you joke if you will it very much was a Pelle.

596
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,619
Rym: You're like, oh you think that's a good idea.

597
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,964
Rym: You really think that's a good.

598
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:27,807
Rym: Well, you're right.

599
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:28,450
Rym: It is a good idea.

600
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:34,670
Scott: No But basically this is part where he's like well, you know prove you're the wolf God.

601
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:37,141
Scott: She's like oh you want me to transform into my real form.

602
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,070
Rym: and he's like yes transform into your real.

603
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,571
Scott: He's like.

604
00:37:39,652 --> 00:37:40,755
Scott: are you sure he's like?

605
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:41,116
Scott: yes.

606
00:37:41,256 --> 00:37:41,457
Scott: Well.

607
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:42,921
Scott: Are you sure no matter what?

608
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:43,202
Scott: yes?

609
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:45,489
Scott: I'm sure 100% no matter what she's like.

610
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:47,534
Rym: well Transforming like that.

611
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:48,979
Rym: There's always a cost.

612
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,926
Rym: I have to enact a price in order to do that.

613
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:52,637
Rym: He's like all right What's the price?

614
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:53,888
Rym: and she's like blood?

615
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,783
Rym: Um Before he's like ah and then she's like or a very small amount of wheats.

616
00:38:00,104 --> 00:38:01,026
Scott: Yeah, he's like.

617
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:04,175
Scott: oh use the week You sure?

618
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:06,349
Scott: yes, yes, please use the wheat.

619
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:30,682
Rym: The show is I guess the the reason I think these two shows regardless of how good they might end up actually being or not being that Lovely complex and spice and wolf as opposed to the vast majority of the new anime out there that I've seen in the last few years They don't fall into the stereotypes immediately and The characters and the designs and just the way they play out.

620
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:44,450
Rym: or they have heart they have they have charm they have something a little bit fresh and Shows like persona Trinity are just so sterile and boring and bland and not boring in the good way like gassaraki but boring in the bad way like persona Trinity.

621
00:38:44,751 --> 00:38:46,036
Scott: Yeah, I mean lovely complex.

622
00:38:46,096 --> 00:38:58,630
Scott: I care about the characters and if spice and wolf I really care about the plot That's going on there, and you know I guess I care about the characters a little bit in spice and wolf And the plot of lovely complex not at all because there isn't one.

623
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:04,530
Rym: But the only problem with spice and wolf is that she totally looks like a fox and not a wolf But that's for sure.

624
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:13,109
Rym: I think that's just because of the coloring because she's a she's a wolf goddess But she's the protector of the harvest so she's kind of supposed to be wheat grain that sort of thing.

625
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:13,390
Rym: yeah.

626
00:39:14,172 --> 00:39:26,129
Scott: But anyway, yeah, these aren't like the best shows ever by any means, but if you're looking for the new animes Is two that you know can serve two different purposes one for the serious kind of anime watching times and one for the?

627
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,605
Scott: Hilarious slapstick anime watching time you know what.

628
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:34,100
Scott: and one for the never One for the torturing your friends with incredibly boring anime time.

629
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:45,544
Rym: or if you have bad taste or if you have bad taste or if you Really really have already seen every show that involves things that may or may not be robot like fighting because this is another one of those generic shows.

630
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:50,307
Scott: yeah I guess if you like if if if the show can be terrible and absolutely everybody.

631
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:55,650
Scott: a show can be terrible But like robots is enough for you, then psychic robots and for some eternity souls.

632
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:02,010
Rym: Yeah, like a show where the main character obviously has the special extra robot, which is a sword.

633
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:07,108
Rym: Yes, because the sword is always better than a gun Beats everything don't you know that?

634
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:12,318
Rym: But these other two shows Particularly spice and wolf.

635
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,100
Rym: if you it's the same level of scrap princess I would say I say pretty much exactly.

636
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,970
Scott: spice and wolf and scrap princess are like right in line like BAM.

637
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,744
Rym: They're like a solid a-minus b-plus anime.

638
00:40:23,885 --> 00:40:24,649
Scott: There's something like that.

639
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:26,819
Scott: They're the same kind of show same genre.

640
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:38,574
Rym: you like one you like the other and also I will admit Horro the wolf goddess is really really freaking cute, but but and I really I think she is she's kind of normal anime girl Levels.

641
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:39,819
Rym: well why I mean the years.

642
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:41,184
Rym: I think the years make her cute.

643
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:42,469
Scott: I think this is cuz you're furry.

644
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:44,253
Rym: What can I say?

645
00:40:44,294 --> 00:40:47,246
Rym: I like fox ears and that sort of thing but what what?

646
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,190
Rym: what makes her cute?

647
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,534
Rym: Is that there you?

648
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:53,124
Rym: I kind of expected this show to go in a bad moe kind of.

649
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:54,990
Rym: protect me big brother.

650
00:40:55,515 --> 00:41:08,463
Rym: you know that kind of show but the wolf goddess is is she acts the way you would expect a minor God or you know a deity to act and that She's kind of sarcastic and really powerful.

651
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:10,450
Scott: yeah, she definitely doesn't take any crap.

652
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:12,378
Scott: I do think that helps the show a lot.

653
00:41:12,398 --> 00:41:25,857
Scott: and what prevents me from being turned off by the girl with the ears in the Tail is that the girl with ears in the tail is the only person with ears in the tail and everyone else is normal and She doesn't act like some moe Whatever she acts like.

654
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:27,463
Scott: you know the character should act it.

655
00:41:27,503 --> 00:41:34,744
Rym: Just you know ears in a tail throw I don't know Ephemeral or fairy or pixie like and in terms of temperament and that sort of thing.

656
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:41,750
Rym: and I think that plus the fact that the Plot looks like it might go toward the lines of you know the old ways in the new way

657
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,358
Scott: I definitely think the slide

658
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:43,580
Rym: is

659
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:52,690
Scott: definitely heading towards some sort of Medieval war feudalism kind of plot going on there historical something with a little bit of supernatural thrown on top there

660
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:53,835
Rym: And that that's.

661
00:41:54,217 --> 00:41:56,790
Rym: I guess I've had an itch for that sort of thing for a long time.

662
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:01,730
Scott: It's gonna be like the Pope versus some feudal lords with some magic on one side.

663
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,710
Rym: I think that's why Claymore appealed to me so much when I first started.

664
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,272
Scott: It's definitely.

665
00:42:05,332 --> 00:42:08,703
Scott: I think it's definitely got some Claymore ishness going on in there in the.

666
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:15,331
Scott: in the way the medieval world is portrayed You know it's sort of like the way the towns and the villages of the normal people living in them There's.

667
00:42:15,371 --> 00:42:19,970
Scott: the people in the Claymore towns are more sad and the people who this place in Wolftown are happier.

668
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:25,450
Rym: But if anything the Claymore universe as far as I can tell is basically the same as the universe in Simon's quest.

669
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,913
Rym: Everything sucks.

670
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:30,908
Rym: It's always dark and everywhere you go people die constantly.

671
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:31,590
Scott: That's pretty accurate.

672
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:34,814
Rym: Yeah, of course much like the Middle Ages We should.

673
00:42:34,915 --> 00:42:37,849
Scott: maybe when I Claymore comes out on DVD if it's not already we can watch that.

674
00:42:38,231 --> 00:42:41,710
Rym: Yeah, but I want to finish ergo proxy first because I really want to see the end of that.

675
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:42,151
Scott: I don't know.

676
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,083
Scott: did the out of business genie on ever finish?

677
00:42:45,103 --> 00:42:46,930
Scott: that were the mostly out of business genie on ever.

678
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:50,110
Rym: I'm sure I will find a way to see the rest of that one way or another.

679
00:42:50,332 --> 00:42:51,910
Scott: I'm sure it can't be impossible.

680
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:57,675
Rym: But yeah spice and wolf worth watching lovely complex worth watching persona Trinity Pretend it doesn't exist.

681
00:42:57,876 --> 00:43:04,088
Rym: I'm better off watch darker than black first because of those kinds of shows I think that one has more potential than this.

682
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,947
Scott: Yeah, well, we only watch like one or two episodes of that one and it has a lot more potential than this.

683
00:43:09,228 --> 00:43:18,878
Rym: Yeah This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
