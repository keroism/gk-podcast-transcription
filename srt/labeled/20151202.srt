00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,871
Rym: It's Wednesday December 2nd 2015.

2
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:20,446
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight the manga Inuyashiki by Hiroyoku.

3
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,010
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:30,140
Scott: Alright I'll talk about something stupid.

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:31,821
Scott: Alright.

6
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:35,601
Scott: so this morning I woke up and you know I check my internet like I usually do.

7
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:36,144
Rym: Good start.

8
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:39,482
Scott: Yeah including you know the regular parts of the internet the webcomic.

9
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:41,349
Rym: Yeah the Civ 5 turn.

10
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:42,192
Scott: The Civ 5 turn.

11
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:43,938
Scott: Actually I didn't have a Civ 5 turn this morning.

12
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:44,440
Scott: It wasn't my turn.

13
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,166
Rym: Yeah the way the timing is.

14
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:46,628
Scott: Or was it?

15
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:47,110
Scott: I don't remember.

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,634
Rym: I got the second half of the game right because there's a bunch of people like with the time zone.

17
00:00:51,714 --> 00:01:00,863
Rym: so the people at the end of the day are very likely to take their turn early and keep the game going but in the morning it's a race condition between Yumi, Scojo, and Alex for who takes their turn.

18
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:04,297
Scott: So then I check the you know in the course of internet.

19
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:08,716
Scott: I check the kpop internet as usual and it was like freaking out.

20
00:01:09,097 --> 00:01:09,780
Scott: and I was like why?

21
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,005
Scott: why is they freaking out?

22
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:16,047
Scott: and apparently just time zones and not paying too much attention to that.

23
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:23,254
Scott: Apparently the like Korean equivalent of Grammy Awards was this morning or last night or this morning.

24
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:26,871
Scott: it was this morning here on my way to work but it was this night for them.

25
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:28,720
Scott: I don't even I don't know the times.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,327
Rym: Alright so that explains that.

27
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,842
Scott: So apparently it was streaming live on Twitch.

28
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:36,202
Scott: so while I'm putting my clothes on I'm like alright let's see what's going on there.

29
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:38,451
Scott: and it was way different.

30
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:39,053
Scott: like.

31
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:40,519
Scott: obviously award shows are dumb.

32
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,929
Scott: like even if it's a award show or something I care about like this video game awards are gonna happen like right now.

33
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:46,635
Scott: it's the end of the year.

34
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:50,592
Scott: there's a lot of award shows in general now even though what?

35
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:51,235
Scott: for some reason?

36
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:54,950
Scott: Grammys and Oscars and things like the beginning of the year and not the I don't know.

37
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:03,165
Scott: but anyway so I'm watching it and I. there's so many things different about it from what we usually have here.

38
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:07,444
Scott: so first of all in the US the Grammy Awards are like an industry thing.

39
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:09,874
Scott: you know it's like the music industry.

40
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:15,854
Scott: there is no music industry single group there in Asia right.

41
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:19,166
Scott: all the awards are from different companies like there's.

42
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:25,012
Scott: imagine if instead of say like I guess for television we have like Golden Globe or Emmy Awards.

43
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:33,542
Scott: imagine if instead of Emmy Awards it was the NBC TV Awards the ABC TV Awards the CBS TV Awards the Fox TV Awards.

44
00:02:33,582 --> 00:02:37,524
Rym: I feel like we had things like that at different points like there but there does not exist.

45
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:38,870
Scott: imagine if there didn't exist in Emmys.

46
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:39,974
Scott: all of TV.

47
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,686
Scott: so right so it's really just.

48
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:44,334
Scott: it's even less of an award show.

49
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:47,065
Scott: it's just congratulations on our own thing right?

50
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:58,781
Scott: so this awards that happened this morning last night was the MAMA Awards which is the Mnet Asian Music Awards which is like Mnet is a TV network.

51
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:02,853
Scott: it's also a record company which is like CJ E&M.

52
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:14,374
Scott: so imagine like if MTV was also producing music and had an award show but gave awards to all of the music and it says is the Asian Music Awards but it's like 90% Korean.

53
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:23,363
Scott: but also the Pet Shop Boys showed up for some reason and doing an award or were they just?

54
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:28,824
Scott: I guess they always get like one big Western group to come to give some second.

55
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:34,654
Rym: I thought you're gonna be like they always get the Pet Shop Boys like achievement inspiration award or something.

56
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:40,012
Rym: it'd be funnier if it was always the Pet Shop Boys would be really weird yeah.

57
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:45,209
Scott: and so the weird things about it other than that is it number one.

58
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:52,222
Scott: I mean at least in the US the Grammys the Oscars which are rigged in terms of the awards are given out by a bunch of old white dudes.

59
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:56,380
Scott: yep it didn't seem like the awards are given based on merit at all.

60
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,217
Scott: they let people vote but fan voting is a small percentage of the awards.

61
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,938
Scott: they're really just give it out what seems to be by rigging like like some.

62
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:13,422
Scott: you know all the different kpop artists are in different companies and like the same company kept winning and this the company was also giving the most performances.

63
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:15,468
Scott: it's just like.

64
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:22,270
Scott: clearly just buy these awards from so it's even less meaningful to win the award right.

65
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:29,719
Scott: but what was interesting the good parts is that number one the performances were definitely not lip-synced in any way.

66
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:33,193
Rym: oh man that that that already means it's a better award show.

67
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:38,358
Scott: the reason they weren't lip-synced in any way is because you go to the Grammys.

68
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:39,886
Scott: who's in the audience of the Grammys?

69
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:49,492
Scott: people who don't want to be there but it's just all famous people in front to back this there's like a little area where the famous people and people receiving awards sit.

70
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:50,658
Rym: oh it's normal people.

71
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:53,031
Scott: it's just a fucking concert you can buy tickets to.

72
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:55,242
Rym: so it's basically a best-of concert.

73
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:59,158
Scott: it's just the best of concert but also like insane shit happens.

74
00:04:59,178 --> 00:05:04,589
Scott: maybe we should go to it someday you want to go to Asia to this thing with 90% of the audience is screaming teenage girls.

75
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,380
Rym: ah you know what it would be worth spectacle.

76
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,052
Scott: it was in Hong Kong actually this year.

77
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:09,662
Scott: I think last year it was in a different country.

78
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:11,452
Rym: oh I have excuses to go there.

79
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,739
Rym: I could I could make that happen.

80
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:16,790
Scott: Chow Yun fat gave the final award unrelated to music.

81
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:28,428
Scott: they just get the most famous person they can get to come like tonight the orderly presented by Mike Tyson and carrot top.

82
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:36,432
Scott: but you know usually they're always promoting on TV like performances by so-and-so so-and-so so right.

83
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:42,937
Scott: there are performances by people who are unannounced to shock the hell out of everybody right.

84
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,757
Scott: so imagine if you go and you're like oh man I'm really exceeded excited to see.

85
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:53,075
Scott: you know I don't know one person because they're on the list couldn't name one band.

86
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:59,806
Scott: I'm really excited to see Rammstein all right and suddenly machine supremacy just on the stage.

87
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,457
Scott: you didn't even fucking know that was gonna happen.

88
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:09,397
Rym: it's there they are and you're like oh my god I feel like we should go.

89
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:12,388
Scott: there's a lot easier things that we can go to.

90
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:13,815
Rym: yeah you know what.

91
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:24,762
Rym: that's probably not any less easy than going to like f1 or something like I feel like if you want to go to a kpop thing I think I heard the Big Bang is coming around the country.

92
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:29,606
Scott: I'll probably see them in New Jersey where they'll be 90% screaming teenage Korean girls.

93
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,055
Rym: yeah I mean we went to the ticket.

94
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:32,965
Scott: tickets will probably be like hundreds of dollars.

95
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:35,799
Rym: we did go to the New York Tokyo musical festival.

96
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,401
Scott: it will be more fun than that for sure yeah but it's all gonna be expensive to sit anywhere.

97
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:44,817
Scott: good you could just watch it on YouTube and screaming teenage girls.

98
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:45,740
Scott: it's like.

99
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:46,967
Scott: would you go to a Bieber concert?

100
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,897
Rym: well I don't like Bieber.

101
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:49,923
Scott: I think that is one thing.

102
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:56,232
Scott: is that somehow you know I don't know if anyone listening knows or cares who Big Bang is but it's like this boy band.

103
00:06:56,954 --> 00:07:01,674
Scott: but they're talented and they write their own music and for some reason dudes also like them.

104
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:03,461
Rym: well I like them.

105
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:07,872
Scott: so all right it's really weird.

106
00:07:07,912 --> 00:07:12,307
Scott: imagine a man just imagine if you liked Bieber and like respected him.

107
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:12,710
Scott: we're like dude.

108
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,454
Scott: he's the awesomest.

109
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:21,925
Scott: only there were five of him and they were all different but the same wall of people is at the concert sure.

110
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:26,501
Rym: so in I guess anime Wednesday topic news.

111
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:27,504
Scott: it wasn't even news.

112
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:28,626
Rym: I got news coming.

113
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:36,973
Rym: yeah so the anime news network is doing its annual mega poll of the best anime.

114
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:40,568
Scott: every website is doing its annual mega poll the anime news network.

115
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:46,314
Rym: one is always interesting because you forget when anime came out like wasn't your pedal this year?

116
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:47,500
Rym: I don't remember me.

117
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,936
Rym: scroll down here and see because they have their rules.

118
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:53,416
Rym: they have a pretty good set of rules about what counts as this year and not as this year.

119
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:53,799
Rym: all right.

120
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,164
Rym: so one punch man counts.

121
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:57,554
Scott: yes so winner no first place.

122
00:07:57,574 --> 00:07:59,642
Rym: well winner winner chicken dinner.

123
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:00,424
Scott: is your pedal count?

124
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:01,989
Rym: is your Akuma's on there?

125
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:04,798
Rym: I don't see it.

126
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,244
Scott: actually yo a mushi pedal.

127
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:11,423
Rym: perhaps under the wise there's just Yamada kun yada man night young black right.

128
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:13,228
Scott: I guess it doesn't count.

129
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,636
Rym: yugioh yurikuma arashi.

130
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:18,025
Rym: what about the movie?

131
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:20,379
Scott: I didn't see but I'm pretty sure is in second in just layer.

132
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:21,803
Rym: wait is it's not an alphabetical order?

133
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:27,257
Scott: just use your control F anyway.

134
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:30,272
Scott: but I mean I haven't seen it yet because it's hard to see.

135
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,505
Scott: but I'm pretty sure the boy in the beast is gonna be second place.

136
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:33,991
Scott: it's a one punch man.

137
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:42,534
Rym: a good thing to do every year is just scroll down this list and see how many of those shows you watch and you might forget that some show is a better idea.

138
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:50,307
Scott: just wait for the poll to fucking finish see what one and then watch those a lot of people you know you vote for five in the poll.

139
00:08:50,327 --> 00:09:00,063
Rym: yeah and it's anime news network people who are voting meaning that one or two good shows and three to four terrible shows are gonna be at the top.

140
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:10,568
Scott: hmm I'm sure you can tell by just by looking at the names which ones are which I the name contains the word punch not probably a good choice if the name contains love love.

141
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:12,736
Scott: ooh probably a bad job yeah.

142
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,501
Scott: but at the same time Yurikuma.

143
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,727
Scott: I voted for that one Yurikuma not actually my sister oh is she?

144
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:17,827
Scott: yeah?

145
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:30,591
Rym: so these are always fun and you should scroll down because there were some good shows this year like Ushio and Tara.

146
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,496
Rym: I was digging that.

147
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:32,220
Rym: I gotta finish that.

148
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,304
Scott: and one punch man.

149
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:42,630
Scott: yeah one punch man he who punches only one time Yurikuma the man but once that that Lupin single puncher.

150
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:45,997
Rym: so yeah you got news.

151
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:48,846
Scott: uh there's the sad news I'm like.

152
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:56,113
Scott: I'm pretty sure everyone heard last week but or when it happened I wasn't even last week it was like a few days ago.

153
00:09:56,214 --> 00:10:10,905
Scott: so Shigeru Mizuki if you don't know who that is is the guy who made Kitaro and also you know Kitaro and a bunch of other mangas but all his other mangas weren't about yokai and stuff.

154
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:11,508
Scott: they were like.

155
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:12,916
Scott: there's one about Hitler.

156
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:14,928
Scott: that's coming out in English real soon.

157
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,417
Rym: I didn't know that was coming out in English.

158
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:17,201
Scott: yeah it's coming out.

159
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:24,137
Scott: and then there's the one I just got perhaps I think the final volume of which is show our history of Japan which is like the entire history of Japan.

160
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:28,691
Scott: well the Showa era at least right.

161
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,734
Scott: and so he's like.

162
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:31,519
Scott: you know after Tezuka he's like.

163
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,054
Scott: you know I know he's the best manga creator but he's like.

164
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:41,855
Rym: it's hard for me to be super objective there because I really like Kitaro.

165
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:43,139
Scott: oh yeah it's super good.

166
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:53,945
Rym: but that's partly because I also really like yokai and Kitaro was the right balance of yokai being both terrifying and silly at the same time which is the best way to consume yokai.

167
00:10:54,347 --> 00:11:00,669
Scott: it's like in some way like Tezuka is like the Disney and also the Stan Lee and also the Will Eisner of.

168
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,231
Scott: you know Japan all at once even though Miyazaki sort of also the Disney in a way yeah.

169
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:10,506
Scott: but Mizuki it's like there's no one to compare him to.

170
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:10,848
Scott: it's like.

171
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:11,873
Scott: was he the Jim Henson?

172
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:18,984
Scott: not really he didn't raise all the children's with his puppet show right but I guess he has the sort that you know.

173
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:24,777
Scott: it doesn't have an equivalency there but he's the same sort of level of status right in terms of importance to the.

174
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:27,168
Scott: you know the culture right.

175
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:36,432
Rym: I guess what you should do is if you've never heard of this like any of what we're talking about go check out Kitaro right just to get the ball rolling and then the ball can keep rolling.

176
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:36,914
Rym: yeah.

177
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:38,762
Scott: so anyway he died like a few days ago.

178
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:42,973
Scott: but dude the man was 93 and he lost his arm in the war.

179
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:43,835
Scott: the war right.

180
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:47,967
Scott: so no not that one.

181
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:55,751
Scott: it's like this is ultimate badass dude who made all these amazing important mangas like incredibly important dude.

182
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:59,041
Scott: so I mean it's not like a surprise.

183
00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:00,266
Scott: it was 93 but yeah.

184
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:08,437
Rym: so in lighter news to uh to make you feel a little bit better the Pikachu build-a-bear is releasing this month.

185
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,588
Rym: you can build a Pikachu.

186
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:12,236
Scott: I guess we know some people who are doing that.

187
00:12:12,377 --> 00:12:18,557
Rym: he can come with either a pokeball costume or a Charizard costume.

188
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:18,998
Scott: there you go.

189
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,007
Rym: I feel like we should go there.

190
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,932
Scott: you do that.

191
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:22,677
Scott: it's a lot of money.

192
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:24,003
Scott: it's a reason I'm not gonna go there.

193
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:27,396
Rym: yeah let's see get the Pikachu alone is 28 bucks.

194
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:29,449
Scott: it's actually not that bad yeah.

195
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:35,342
Scott: but I mean you want to remix that shit right because you gotta get like Star Wars stuff and they have pony stuff at build-a-bear.

196
00:12:35,382 --> 00:12:35,945
Scott: how do I know this?

197
00:12:35,985 --> 00:12:44,081
Scott: cuz I walk past one and I looked in the window on my way to play netrunner and so I'm pretty sure they let you mix that shit up.

198
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:45,608
Scott: you can put like Star Wars.

199
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:54,406
Scott: you know you can put a Darth Vader head on a Pikachu body with the Charmander costume and a My Little Pony feet or you know accessory or something hooves.

200
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:55,833
Scott: yeah I'm sure you could.

201
00:12:55,853 --> 00:13:01,841
Scott: yeah I'm sure they would let you do that if you paid the money but I'm sure it also costs a hoof and a hoof.

202
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:17,200
Rym: this is yet another example of build-a-bear causing that odd dichotomy where a bunch of 20 to 30 year old people are gonna be making little stuffed animals right next to a bunch of like four year olds with their parents.

203
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,964
Scott: that odd dichotomy when Rym wants to go to the kpop concert in Jersey right next to the teenage girls.

204
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:25,376
Rym: yeah I'm glad to see this cultural mixing.

205
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:33,521
Rym: I'm glad to see generations enjoying their pop culture together even though you still should not go to the local elementary school and see if anyone wants to play Pokemon with you.

206
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:48,410
Rym: but anyway things of the day many of the things of the day we've had over the years were created by one man Neil Cicierega.

207
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:55,914
Rym: he is probably the avatar of the expression of the internet in the modern world.

208
00:13:55,975 --> 00:13:58,223
Rym: he's the master and king of remixes.

209
00:13:58,243 --> 00:14:07,642
Rym: I'm not even gonna list the things he's done because now he has a patreon and basically he's just offering to continue doing what he's been doing.

210
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:09,170
Scott: how much money is getting in his patreon?

211
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:11,641
Rym: he's already up to $1,000 a much.

212
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,247
Scott: is our patreon like 200?

213
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,588
Scott: are you saying that we're only five times less than Neil Cicierega currently?

214
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:24,251
Scott: yes that is where we stand as I figured he was like 50 times more than us not five times more than us.

215
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:25,275
Rym: so inter.

216
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:31,618
Rym: actually in terms of content created if you just go by hours we probably made more.

217
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,723
Scott: I mean it just by hours.

218
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:35,466
Scott: we're catching up with shit like bonanza.

219
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:49,339
Rym: but god this patreon is extra special because one you know when you make a patreon because as you know GeekNights has a patreon you have to say like what you're creating.

220
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:55,506
Rym: so we're creating podcasts and lectures and these other things Neil Cicierega is creating star dot star.

221
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:58,656
Rym: if you give him a dollar you are really nice.

222
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:13,725
Rym: if you give him $2 you get his entire discography from 1999 to 2014 and if he raises his stretch goal if he starts getting $50,000 a month that'll happen which is less no more.

223
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:16,575
Rym: it is more than what we are asking for.

224
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:17,036
Rym: the will.

225
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:20,430
Rym: quit our jobs and do get away this $2 a month for the discography.

226
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,580
Rym: 50 yeah $2 it's too much.

227
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:27,119
Rym: well you could donate for a month get the link and then stop donating.

228
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:37,058
Scott: if you give it all away for free on YouTube and I pay for YouTube bread so I'm already paying every time I listen to his shit he'll get a piece but you get one big old download which might be like flag files or something.

229
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:37,360
Rym: I don't know.

230
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:39,653
Scott: find out but the video part is on YouTube.

231
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:44,272
Rym: - yeah no this is just his discography right which I assume is just the audio.

232
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:49,394
Rym: yeah but yeah I'd like to have that just as a file set of like flax or 96 kbps.

233
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:54,936
Rym: you do that and give me the files but I'm gonna read this thing cuz I'm kind of a fanboy of this dude.

234
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,066
Rym: hi I'm Neil Cisarega.

235
00:15:57,528 --> 00:15:58,995
Rym: I'm a web artist and web comedian.

236
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:01,608
Rym: I've been webbing around since 2001 the year.

237
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:02,875
Scott: all of those things are accurate.

238
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:05,647
Rym: I make everything from original videos to mash.

239
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:09,502
Rym: oh so mash and ups are links but the H in between them is not.

240
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:10,487
Rym: I gotta click on that later.

241
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:14,805
Rym: comedy videos animated gifs harmless hoaxes etc.

242
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:16,831
Rym: and that's it.

243
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:20,624
Rym: he just has this animated gif showing a bunch of things he's done.

244
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:28,409
Rym: he is a man who knows who he is ranging from hiyako juichi to puppet pals to eight legs.

245
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:30,974
Rym: okay remember that one.

246
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:34,040
Scott: yeah I know every work he's done.

247
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,569
Scott: I'm surprised he did not include however the cow.

248
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:43,098
Rym: so my thing of the day is that that man is asking for money to continue doing what he has done.

249
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,565
Scott: he's gonna continue no matter what.

250
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:45,871
Rym: yeah I know but so are we.

251
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:50,994
Rym: so if we are hypocritical for doing a patreon he is equally hypocritical.

252
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:56,657
Rym: you should back his patreon first and if you have money left over you can also back us anyway.

253
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:02,834
Scott: so what do you think of when you think of Alan Moore a watchman?

254
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:12,165
Rym: okay also a picture of Alan Moore like a picture of his face that those are the two things I think of particularly his wedding.

255
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:19,344
Scott: okay so apparently I did not know this until just recently and it was a saved up thing of the day.

256
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:19,564
Scott: who in 1981?

257
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:26,185
Scott: whoa whoa or 82.

258
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:28,211
Scott: Alan Moore was making comics.

259
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:32,181
Scott: as he's way older than us he made some comics.

260
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:48,486
Scott: he in fact made one two three four five five comics and these comics were published in the magazine obviously in the UK all right because that's where he was at the time.

261
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:55,922
Scott: they weren't published in the US for another 15 years and I guess they were still unknown but now they're gonna be more widely known.

262
00:17:57,205 --> 00:18:03,222
Scott: he published these comics in the magazine known as Marvel Star Wars UK.

263
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:04,325
Rym: well wait what?

264
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:05,288
Scott: here are?

265
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:08,837
Scott: five Star Wars comics by Alan Moore whoa.

266
00:18:08,978 --> 00:18:10,704
Rym: so are they trippy?

267
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:11,929
Rym: are they gritty?

268
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:12,773
Rym: are they weird?

269
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,841
Scott: they are Star Wars comics by Alan Moore.

270
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,964
Scott: the end.

271
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:19,208
Rym: in the moment we're going to be at Pac South.

272
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:28,466
Scott: officially our schedule is done.

273
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:33,128
Rym: I'm pulling it up but it's gonna be easy for once because we're doing two lectures at Pac South.

274
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,259
Rym: they are brand new lectures.

275
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,047
Rym: we're not recycling anything it's all you.

276
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:40,181
Rym: and well yeah one of them doesn't need slides really.

277
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:41,084
Rym: so that's that's a bonus.

278
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:44,174
Rym: they're both at 1 p.m.

279
00:18:44,194 --> 00:18:48,049
Rym: in the Bobcat theater one on Saturday and one on Sunday.

280
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:50,921
Rym: so on Saturday July 30th at 1 p.m.

281
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:56,241
Rym: in the Bobcat theater we're doing Atari game design and on Sunday do you know about it.

282
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,571
Rym: sorry I know a lot about.

283
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:01,021
Rym: no we're not talking about coding Atari games.

284
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:09,085
Scott: and you can I slept to study the technical limitations of the Atari because that's how greatly influenced the design of those games and I have studied a bunch of that.

285
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:13,670
Rym: and the thing is the idea is that if you want to design a board game you want to study game design.

286
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:22,124
Rym: you should probably start with like Atari video game fundamentals because you can look at the screen and literally count pixels.

287
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:29,232
Rym: there's not that much complexity that can be hidden from you in terms of game design player interaction.

288
00:19:29,854 --> 00:19:32,505
Rym: so we're gonna go through that in great detail.

289
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:34,936
Rym: and then Sunday January 31st at 1 p.m.

290
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:45,879
Rym: in the Bobcat theater we're going to be doing designing game rules like why Hellas is an unplayable game and why most Kickstarter games have terrible rules.

291
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:55,055
Rym: we're gonna be at mag fest do a between Scott and I. we're gonna be on like seven panels but anything that's all still in the works scheduling and whatnot.

292
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:58,578
Rym: I think our schedule is actually done in terms of what we're gonna be on.

293
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,025
Rym: we're just waiting for you know when?

294
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:03,260
Rym: and then I guess when is all we really care about?

295
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:09,467
Rym: we're gonna be a PAX East probably doing a bunch of stuff and enforcing pec south needs enforcers.

296
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:14,087
Rym: so you should sign up for that and back us on patreon if you've already backed Neil Cicierega.

297
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,925
Rym: so we're finally reviewing manga and comics again.

298
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:21,609
Rym: as you might have noticed partly cuz Scott's just been giving me things to say and read them mm-hmm.

299
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:24,847
Rym: but this this is a pretty good manga and I feel like you guys should read it.

300
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:26,016
Rym: well comic I think I didn't.

301
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:29,780
Scott: I say I was gonna say comic instead of you couldn't even stick to your own thing for like five.

302
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:39,446
Rym: so Inuyashiki is a slice of life about an old man with a terrible family who's dying of stomach cancer.

303
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:39,869
Rym: all right.

304
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:40,814
Scott: so this manga.

305
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:51,040
Scott: I found out about this because I was looking down the list of things to buy and I said oh there's a manga there and that is not just some typical shonen or shoujo garbage manga.

306
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:53,574
Scott: it clearly is different just based on the cover alone.

307
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:55,747
Scott: oh and the person who made is the guy who made gone.

308
00:20:55,767 --> 00:21:03,747
Scott: so just something that I think I would probably like and I know is really violent but I just haven't read it because I haven't not because I don't want to.

309
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:05,256
Scott: I'm pretty sure I'll like it if I did read it.

310
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:07,807
Scott: yep and so but this is volume one.

311
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:09,213
Scott: so let me pick this up.

312
00:21:10,277 --> 00:21:14,054
Scott: and yeah it's about this old guy whose family was really the worst family.

313
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:17,270
Scott: like you know he's a salaryman Japan doing a shitty job.

314
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:18,476
Scott: he hates doing it.

315
00:21:18,496 --> 00:21:25,068
Rym: he's finally saved up enough money to be fully retired to have a house to live with his family in peace for his dad for his you know old years.

316
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:31,599
Rym: he looks way older than he is just because of a life of stress and misery and his family is the worst family.

317
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:34,114
Scott: his wife clearly doesn't love him or anything.

318
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:35,764
Scott: how they got married I'd love to see the past.

319
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:40,291
Scott: there haven't been any flashbacks like that showing you anything you know from how this started.

320
00:21:40,352 --> 00:21:40,553
Scott: right.

321
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:43,089
Rym: I mean they're not the worst in like they're not Nazis or anything.

322
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:43,371
Rym: they're just.

323
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:44,659
Scott: they're just really.

324
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:52,099
Scott: they don't appreciate or love their or care about their father even though everything they have is because of him and the kids are way spoiled.

325
00:21:52,139 --> 00:22:01,108
Scott: there's when they show up at the new house you know there's like a guy coming out of a Ferrari in this you know in this other house and they're like that's not our house the nice one.

326
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,688
Scott: well we had this shitty house in the back and it's like dude you're living in like a shithole.

327
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:07,123
Rym: two seconds ago was the shitty house in the back like.

328
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,631
Rym: I would kill to live in a house like that.

329
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:10,421
Scott: hell yeah yeah and that dude.

330
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:12,457
Scott: I'll be friends with the guy with the Ferrari living out front.

331
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:14,468
Scott: maybe give me a ride yeah whatever.

332
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:16,579
Scott: but now these kids are so shitty and it's just.

333
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,044
Rym: it's 20 pages.

334
00:22:18,064 --> 00:22:27,919
Rym: the first 20-ish pages are just continual gut punches to you watching this guy suffer through all of this just and it's one of those ones we're like.

335
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:29,772
Scott: I almost couldn't take it the same way.

336
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:33,349
Scott: there's been a few other things like this where I'm like dude just just like.

337
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:35,758
Scott: kill your family like dude.

338
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:36,381
Scott: just punch them.

339
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:38,738
Scott: it's like you know just do something it's like and the person is.

340
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:45,511
Scott: you know I really can't stand it a lot easily when there's someone who's just like being victimized and just done in a story.

341
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:47,358
Scott: it just doesn't do anything.

342
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:50,171
Scott: at least run away or something right.

343
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:56,868
Scott: just stop giving them money just like you got all the money just like you own the house sell that fucking house let them be homeless and be like see ya.

344
00:22:56,928 --> 00:22:58,737
Rym: so I mean it gets to the point.

345
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,266
Rym: this all happens like right in the beginning.

346
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:02,438
Rym: we're like you're really feeling depressed.

347
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:03,564
Rym: this is not going well.

348
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:08,488
Rym: and then he finds out he has stomach cancer and a few months to live and he can't.

349
00:23:08,608 --> 00:23:14,844
Scott: it's like well now you wasted your whole life - you can't even run away and he can't even tell his family because they literally will not listen to him.

350
00:23:14,904 --> 00:23:17,138
Rym: talk long enough for him to tell them that he's dying.

351
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:18,303
Scott: they also won't give a shit.

352
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:25,006
Rym: and then the line that shit that made this manga go from depressing to amazing.

353
00:23:25,026 --> 00:23:26,312
Rym: there the words.

354
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:28,300
Rym: I'm gonna quote the words where I went.

355
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,123
Rym: holy shit what.

356
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:34,691
Rym: but we only have weapon grade units in stock.

357
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:42,539
Rym: I mean I've got a spoiler to kind of sell you on reading this thing but we're not gonna.

358
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,866
Rym: I mean there's not you're just.

359
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:44,509
Rym: it's a comic.

360
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:49,913
Rym: read it like it's just read it but basically a UFO or something crashes into a park.

361
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:52,888
Scott: it's totally random like just out of nowhere.

362
00:23:53,008 --> 00:23:55,502
Scott: it's not completely out of nowhere but it's mostly out of nowhere.

363
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:58,039
Scott: the guys in the park with the dog the only thing that he loves.

364
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:03,291
Rym: it loves him that his family hates by the way and didn't want him to get but he got it and taking care of his dog dogs.

365
00:24:03,331 --> 00:24:04,256
Scott: great dog is good.

366
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,121
Scott: it's a good dog anyway he's hanging with in the park with the dog being all sad but hanging with the dog.

367
00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:15,428
Scott: so that's nice and aliens just show up and you're probably thinking well this sounds like the stupidest thing ever.

368
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:19,788
Scott: so I'm just gonna read the dialogue and I was what I was hesitant while reading.

369
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:26,222
Scott: I'm like really this is why I thought I was gonna get some serious drama and I ended up getting some alien garbage.

370
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:31,081
Rym: really there is one page of just dialogue of the aliens talking to each other.

371
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,429
Rym: any damage nothing here.

372
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:40,717
Rym: however we did destroy two of this planet's intelligent life-forms daddy to intelligent life.

373
00:24:40,757 --> 00:24:41,802
Rym: so there's them hanging out there.

374
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:44,573
Scott: when they first said that I thought is the dog intelligent?

375
00:24:44,674 --> 00:24:46,983
Rym: yeah can we rebuild them?

376
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:48,910
Rym: I'm afraid not.

377
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:55,581
Rym: then at least recreate their outer appearances as quickly as you can convincing enough that they don't realize we tampered with them.

378
00:24:55,902 --> 00:24:58,594
Rym: but sir we only have weapon grade units in stock.

379
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,764
Rym: wait no they'll destroy the entire planet.

380
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:02,392
Rym: that's not our problem.

381
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:04,923
Rym: we need to disengage at once and they just fucking leave.

382
00:25:06,027 --> 00:25:07,171
Scott: so this guy wakes up.

383
00:25:07,432 --> 00:25:08,134
Scott: he doesn't know.

384
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:08,676
Scott: you know he knows.

385
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:10,848
Scott: he just thinks as he's himself.

386
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,644
Rym: yeah he comes home and his family's like where the fuck were you?

387
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:14,587
Rym: you piece of shit.

388
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,502
Scott: yeah he doesn't realize anything but he's not himself.

389
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:22,580
Scott: he eventually discovers he's now a robot that is not himself that he died.

390
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:30,439
Scott: yeah the doctors are like whoa actually just a robot with all the memories of the person who died and he's basically super powerful and super invincible.

391
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:37,494
Scott: and of course yes there is another person who the same who also died and was replaced by a robot who's clearly gonna be the villain or something.

392
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:41,692
Rym: yeah he is major Kusanagi except he's a frail old man.

393
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:49,920
Rym: and the best part about this comic is that once he realizes what's going on he isn't really that horrified.

394
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,466
Rym: he basically just becomes a superhero.

395
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:51,787
Rym: he's like.

396
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:53,494
Rym: you know what this is awesome.

397
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:57,734
Scott: uh I was gonna die of stomach cancer anyway I died a real alien.

398
00:25:57,754 --> 00:25:59,744
Rym: yeah he has this revelation to.

399
00:25:59,784 --> 00:26:01,253
Rym: he was like well I'm someone different.

400
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:03,909
Rym: I don't need to pay for these pieces of shit anymore.

401
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,774
Rym: my family like.

402
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:05,619
Rym: I don't have to help them.

403
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:06,563
Rym: I can do whatever I want.

404
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:08,530
Scott: yeah but that family yeah.

405
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:16,284
Rym: but then I guess the second moment where this went from like just a pretty good thing to really great is the hacking montage.

406
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:21,385
Rym: that I don't want to spoil because there's a lot of reasons why that scene was great one.

407
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:29,377
Rym: it was realistic like really realistic which never happens in comics like this - it was actually subtle.

408
00:26:29,397 --> 00:26:47,739
Rym: like instead of having the usual manga BS of you know a whole bunch of people explaining like well what's Twitter blah blah blah blah blah and then like late spoon feeding you what he's doing it just shows you this montage of what he's doing like screenshots of Twitter and screenshots of YouTube and then it cuts to.

409
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,376
Rym: these kids are all on the phone with their parents and it doesn't like.

410
00:26:51,718 --> 00:26:53,731
Scott: well cuz you assume the audience for this thing right?

411
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:54,657
Scott: is Japanese kids?

412
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:55,422
Scott: they fucking know.

413
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:58,983
Scott: yeah they don't need to be explained to them what Twitter is like what the fuck.

414
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:04,707
Rym: but there's a lot of nuance in this comic that is not there and a lot of other manga I have read.

415
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:10,168
Rym: that makes me really appreciate the subtlety that like it just I appreciate.

416
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:15,600
Scott: I really want to see volume 2 a lot and it's not out yet at least not in English and I'm like oh my god give me to volume 2.

417
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,933
Rym: yep although all the characters are meeting other than his family are pretty great and it ain't like the this volume.

418
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:29,239
Rym: the first trade ends on a really good spot but then there's like a little like next step like sort of dinner.

419
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:38,064
Scott: it's not a cliffhanger but it's like they're showing you what the story is actually gonna be because it's you know obviously only partially about the drama with him and his family.

420
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:39,954
Scott: right you know they're sort of showing you.

421
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:42,649
Scott: this is what to expect from the rest of this manga.

422
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,929
Scott: yeah and it's like oh that is if that's what's to expect then give me more please.

423
00:27:47,492 --> 00:27:49,239
Scott: yes sir I would like some more.

424
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:51,729
Rym: the art is super consistently good.

425
00:27:51,749 --> 00:28:00,263
Scott: the yeah the art and guns is always like crazy good yeah it sort of has that realisticness of like the backgrounds of Death Note.

426
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:12,025
Scott: but the character you know because Death Note he always does like like he draws the backgrounds in Death Note like architecturally like everything is super straight lines with hyper details and then the characters like normal anime characters.

427
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:18,512
Scott: in this it's like okay the backgrounds are just as Death Note II but perhaps a little less.

428
00:28:19,055 --> 00:28:30,699
Scott: you know straight line architectural but still you know plenty of details going on which is the way the people are more realistic you know and less stereotypically anime.

429
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:34,456
Scott: ish you know their faces are really really good right they're close.

430
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:50,767
Scott: they're somewhere in between those you know stereotypical anime style and like the Ikegami you know real people manga style like somewhere halfway like think about the faces in sanctuary when a character is watching something and reacting to it in a complex and intense manner.

431
00:28:51,570 --> 00:29:09,102
Rym: it's like that but with this old man seeing in justice around him swallowing it because he knows he's powerless to do anything about it and being really conflicted about it and all this like the guy looks like he's about to explode every single panel but he's just bottling it all in and hiding

432
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:09,243
Scott: it.

433
00:29:09,263 --> 00:29:11,836
Scott: he's gonna explode now big time but he did explode.

434
00:29:11,977 --> 00:29:13,587
Scott: one day might destroy the world.

435
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,956
Scott: that powerful enough to destroy the world.

436
00:29:14,977 --> 00:29:15,941
Scott: that's not our problem.

437
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:19,430
Rym: I also like the bum guy.

438
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:21,656
Rym: the bum guys like.

439
00:29:22,298 --> 00:29:23,542
Rym: I feel like that's gonna be a sidekick.

440
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,446
Rym: that's gonna be his Robin.

441
00:29:24,948 --> 00:29:26,093
Scott: sure why not go bum guy?

442
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:26,334
Scott: go.

443
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:28,445
Scott: yeah I don't know if we'll see the bum guy again.

444
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:29,874
Rym: I'll bet we see the bum guy again.

445
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,322
Rym: okay I'm confident.

446
00:29:31,423 --> 00:29:36,265
Scott: but yeah I guess if you like this I'm also gonna try to find slash read guns.

447
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:37,530
Scott: so I don't see if you like this.

448
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:43,902
Rym: you wouldn't like see those by the other guy kid in the end as much as anime posters and Gantz all over his walls.

449
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:45,329
Scott: yeah people always do that.

450
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,777
Scott: yeah I mean in one punch man.

451
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:49,999
Scott: well you know there's all kinds of stuff referencing the manga the other the other manga.

452
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:50,885
Scott: that one is working.

453
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:54,183
Rym: we also notice the rich guy in the house in front is what a famous manga artist.

454
00:29:54,564 --> 00:30:00,060
Rym: yeah pretty sure that's the guy thousand air in there.

455
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,754
Scott: yeah that's interesting that in the manga Inuyashiki you can read guns.

456
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:12,225
Rym: so I guess it's set in a world where Gantz exists meaning it's probably just set straight up in our world.

457
00:30:12,386 --> 00:30:13,210
Scott: yeah probably yeah.

458
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,129
Rym: I don't know what else I can say because I just want you guys that's all.

459
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,057
Scott: it's only one volume.

460
00:30:17,077 --> 00:30:17,943
Scott: what else can happen in it?

461
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:23,029
Rym: yeah but without us just like going through and telling you everything that happens which is really read it to you.

462
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,077
Scott: yeah but yeah you can.

463
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:29,282
Scott: you know you might even just based on what we've always done is really summarize the plot.

464
00:30:29,342 --> 00:30:31,148
Scott: but I mean it.

465
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:43,168
Scott: you know it makes you feel when you start reading it like frustrated with the shitty family but then you want to take out your aggression on them and you know stand up for this old man and then and you know the rest of it is all right.

466
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:44,816
Scott: well the old man's a super powerful robot.

467
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,945
Scott: now sorry family shit.

468
00:30:48,772 --> 00:30:51,440
Rym: it's like when Astro Boy remembers like oh I can just punch people.

469
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:55,743
Scott: boom Astro Boy vs One Punch Man.

470
00:30:57,324 --> 00:30:58,185
Rym: well we know who'd win.

471
00:30:58,485 --> 00:31:07,140
Rym: obviously this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

472
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:12,347
Rym: special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

478
00:31:57,199 --> 00:32:41,452
Rym: the amazing patrons of tonight's GeekNights are in order of the amount of money they give us on a monthly basis even though I got to make sure you give at least a little bit of that money to feel sus regga Nicholas Brando Rebecca Dunn James David White Christian coons Jess mechanical mind Renee from New Zealand Robert Lee Ryan parent drew up and lender rare Lavelle Brian's a droney Rochelle Montanona Finn Eric Silverado Rym eats poop kinetic man William Eisen rose Aaron series Chris midkiff Chris Knox flame dark fire Samuel Cordery Daniel Redmond Chris had died Doug Snyder Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

479
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:47,993
Rym: so we did just record right after we did the show the November Q&A.

480
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:59,587
Rym: so I'm gonna wait a few days just because I'm lazy and there's a Rangers game that I want to go watch the rest of because it's pretty good right now and Emily is not home she's visiting family and things for the holidays.

481
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:07,988
Rym: so pretty much she's gonna eat a bowl of croutons and ranch dressing for dinner and watch the Rangers game and then either play undertale or rocket League until I fall asleep.

482
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:11,685
Rym: but yeah that'll go up patrons only soon as they get a chance.

484
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:21,858
